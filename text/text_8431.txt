BACKGROUND
traditional markers have played a pivotal role in genetic map construction and marker-assisted selection  in breeding programs. genetic maps consist of several types of molecular markers including rflp , aflp , ssr , sts , dart  and snp . rflp markers have been used to construct first generation genetic maps  <cit> , but such hybridization-based markers have practical disadvantages. this led to interest in pcr-based markers, in particular those based on ssrs. ssr markers were derived from sequences held in public databases including genome sequences and est sequences , and small insert genomic libraries  <cit> . a high-density consensus genetic map containing  <dig> ssr loci has been constructed in barley  <cit> . dart can detect and genotype dna variations at several hundred genomic loci in parallel without relying on sequence information. dart markers have been successfully applied to genetic maps and diversity analyses of barley germplasm. the first genetic map consisting of  <dig> dart markers was constructed in a population derived from a cross between steptoe and morex  <cit> . these genetic maps were used to construct consensus maps which included rflps, ssrs, stss and darts  <cit> . the first sets of snp markers were developed by resequencing the european barley gene pool in elite barley genotypes and exploring est sequences. based on this information, a pilot oligo nucleotide pool assay containing snps in  <dig> barley unigenes was developed for use with illumina golden gate bead array technology  <cit> . later,  <dig> snps markers were developed based on barley ests and sequenced amplicons  <cit> . a total of  <dig> markers including snp, dart, ssr and sts markers were mapped in single population  <cit> . recently, the genotyping by sequencing  approach has provided low-cost, high-density genotype information. high-density markers have been mapped in maize, wheat and barley using this technology . gbs is a powerful method for developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing a genome shotgun sequence.

however, there are disadvantages of these types of markers. dart genotyping requires special equipment which is unavailable in most research institutions. for snp markers, although recent advances in molecular techniques have enabled high-throughput snp genotyping including microarray hybridization, allele-specific pcr detection and primer extension , and lower-throughput and less equipment dependence including cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  markers  <cit>  and allele-specific pcr primers  <cit> , they are either costly or low-throughput. gbs is high throughput, but costly for barley with its large genome. ssr markers are extensively used in qtl mapping and mas, however some are nonspecific, or very weak. furthermore, due to minor differences between genotypes for some ssr markers, laborious sequence-grade high-resolution gels or costly capillary electrophoresis systems are required to genotype these markers.

in contrast to dart, ssr and snp markers, indel markers with moderate polymorphism differences can be amplified using regular pcr instruments and genotyped using an agarose gel electrophoresis system or hrm  technology. indel markers have been successfully used for genetic studies in rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> .

hrm curve analysis is a post-pcr analysis method for characterizing nucleic acid samples based on dna strand dissociation behaviour during transition from double-stranded dna to single-stranded dna with increasing temperature. it uses intercalating dyes, highly accurate melt curves and application of specific statistical analyses of genetic variations in pcr amplicons. the amplicon differences are reflected in the melting temperatures. hrm has been used for snp genotyping and indel genotyping in wheat  <cit> .

although indel markers are advantageous for genetic studies, genome-wide indel markers have not been explored in barley. the recent release of the barley genomic sequence  <cit>  has made it possible to explore indel markers in barley. in addition, the published barley physical maps and genetic maps  <cit>  helped us to anchor all available ssrs, darts, snps and indel markers to the popseq genetic map and physical map based on sequence similarity.

the objective of this study was to develop genome-wide indel markers for genetic studies in barley and to use the alternative hrm method to genotype some indel markers while avoiding post-pcr procedures. furthermore, these indel markers were integrated with earlier generation markers, including ssr, dart and snp markers, into single map based on barley physical maps instead of the consensus map calculation to avoid genetic position bias.

RESULTS
distribution of indel markers
all whole genome shotgun  contig data for morex, barke and bowman was downloaded from ftp://ftpmips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plants/barley/public_data/. on a genome-wide basis,  <dig>  indels were identified between morex and barke in the genomic dna sequence database. indels differing by 3–100 bp accounted for 2 % of the total indels. our aim was to develop a set of indel markers with density of one marker per cm, thus about  <dig> contigs containing indels between morex and barke distributed evenly in the whole barley genome were selected for primers development. in the 1h and 4h chromosome regions, wgs contigs from the three cultivars  were aligned. geneious  <dig> . <dig> was used to develop ~ <dig> indel markers with 1–100 bp polymorphisms. amplicons ranged from  <dig> to 250 bp. to increase primer specificity, the developed primer sequences were used for blast analysis of morex genomic sequences. a total of  <dig> indel markers were selected as they were anchored specifically to one region of the barley genome . about 75 % of the total indel markers had 3–20 bp polymorphisms . the number of designed indel markers in each chromosome ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with densities  <dig>  indels per cm .table  <dig> the distribution and number of indel markers in barley



characterization of indel markers
of the  <dig> indel markers,  <dig> were randomly selected from chromosome 5h to test their polymorphisms on 6 % polyacrylamide gel. these markers were developed based on morex and barke sequences. these markers, except for indel <dig> and indel <dig>  were polymorphic between morex and barke , such that ~95 % were successfully developed. we also tested  <dig> markers from chromosome 1h, 2h, 3h, 6h and 7h, 96 % of these markers have unique amplicon.

genotyping by hrm analysis
fifty five pairs of indel primers  each with single pcr product band were used to genotype morex and barke using hrm analysis. the results showed that hrm technology can be used to score the two genotypes if the melting temperature difference is > <dig>  °c . thirty six pairs of markers were polymorphic  using hrm technology, such that ~65 % of these markers can be genotyped using this technology . pcr amplicon differences of these markers between morex and barke ranged 3–38 bp . the coefficient determinant  between indel lengths and melting temperature differences was only  <dig>  . in other word, there is no correlation between indel length and melting temperature difference.fig.  <dig> genotyping indel <dig> using hrm analysis between morex and barke. the amplicon size of indel <dig> is  <dig> and 96 bp in morex and barke, respectively. the right melting curve represents morex and the left melting curve represents barke

using hrm technology, we tested indel <dig> in a doubled haploid  population containing  <dig> lines derived from the cross of alexis and sloop. the two parental lines had a marker melting temperature difference of  <dig>  °c. all of the dh lines were genotyped based on hrm analysis. the pcr product was identified further on 6 % polyacrylamide gel. the gel result was consistent with hrm analysis.

integration of ssr, dart, snp and indel markers
the primer sequences of ssr markers and the reference sequence of dart, snp and indel markers were used for blast analysis of morex genomic sequences as described above. the genetic positions of these markers were displayed. the best genetic position was placed on the top. the genetic positions of ssr markers were double checked with the existing genetic map positions with inconsistent ssr markers removed. a total of  <dig> markers including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> dart,  <dig> snps and  <dig> indel markers were anchored to the single map . the distribution of markers on each chromosome was about  <dig> markers. the average genetic marker density was about seven markers per cm, i.e. about 700 kb in physical distance between each marker on average. the genetic positions and physical contigs of these markers are listed in additional file  <dig>  and the genetic map containing indel markers is presented in fig.  <dig> table  <dig> distribution of genetic markers in the barley high-resolution genetic map

confirmation of indel marker positions
thirty-four indel with three ssr polymorphic markers from chromosomes 1h, 4h and 5h were used to confirm whether indel markers could be mapped to expected locations in the populations of alexis × sloop, franklin × yyxt and vlamingh × buloke, respectively. for the polymorphic indel markers on chromosome 1h , all seven indel markers with one ssr marker were mapped to the 1h region  in the population of alexis × sloop. for the fourteen polymorphic indel markers on chromosome 4h , all markers were mapped to the 4h region . the linkage map of thirteen indel markers from chromosome 5h was constructed from the population of vlamingh × buloke. all tested 5h markers were mapped to the 5h location . the results indicated that the indel markers were assigned to the correct chromosomes and marker orders were consistent  <cit> .

discussion
in the present study, we developed  <dig> indel markers and confirmed their effectiveness. these indel markers were integrated with earlier generation ssr, dart and snp markers to construct single genetic map containing  <dig> markers based on the morex physical map  <cit> .

development of indel markers
two types of molecular markers, ssr and dart, have been widely used in barley genetic map construction and qtl mapping  <cit> . recently, sequenced cdnas have provided a facile route to detect snps  <cit> . however, dart and snp markers require special instruments. indel markers have become a valuable resource for genetics and qtl mapping studies in species such as rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . recently, the release of the barley genomic sequence has facilitated the discovery of more polymorphisms within barley cultivars. abundant and highly reproducible indel markers were developed based on the alignment of genomic sequences. unspecific markers were removed after blast analysis of the barley genomic dna sequence. the present study showed that 96 % of indel markers have unique amplicons. for those markers with multiple bands, the amplicon sizes in additional file  <dig> could help to distinguish those amplicons. in rice, a set of  <dig> indel markers have size differences larger than 30 bp  <cit> , while most indel markers in barley ranged from  <dig> to 20 bp. these indel markers can be differentiated by hrm or page methods. mazaheri et al.  <cit>  developed  <dig>  pcr-based transposable elements  repeat junctions markers  in barley, whereas unlike co-dominant indel markers, most rjms were dominant markers.

genotyping of indel markers
indel markers can be scored using electrophoresis method, such as in arabidopsis  <cit> . here we attempted to use an alternative hrm method to score some markers. the differentiation ability of this technique was previously investigated by mackay et al.  <cit> . high-resolution amplicon analysis clearly differentiated samples with a 2 bp difference  <cit> . this study showed that the hrm curve results were consistent with previous studies. moreover,  <dig> indel markers each with single pcr band identified in this study were experimentally confirmed. the indel genetic map will provide faster and cheaper molecular markers for molecular assisted breeding and map-based cloning in barley.

integration of ssr, dart, snp and indel markers
the newly-designed indel markers were anchored to the morex physical maps and popseq genetic maps. combining the physical and genetic maps has been done by mayer et al.  <cit>  and mascher et al.  <cit> . we constructed single map consisting of several types of markers  based on reference sequences of ssr, dart and snp markers. previous consensus map was constructed using model calculations based on existing genetic maps derived from different populations  <cit> , so genetic distance bias occurred with some markers when not shared in all genetic maps. however, in the present study, by blast analysis of barley genomic sequences, markers were located to physical positions, and relevant genetic positions were obtained from popseq genetic maps  <cit> .

application in qtl mapping and fine mapping
many qtl traits have been mapped in barley  <cit> . developing molecular markers within qtl regions is essential to clone the gene. morex and barke are the most commonly used barley genotypes for genetic studies. indel markers were created based on polymorphisms between these two ecotypes to meet the demands of researchers. in some regions, bowman contigs were also aligned with morex and barke to explore more polymorphic markers.

some snp and dart markers can be converted to indel markers. by extracting morex bac contigs sequences containing snp and dart markers , we can also obtain relevant sequences of barke and bowman through the website http://webblast.ipk-gatersleben.de/barley/viroblast.php. indel markers can be developed in the indel polymorphic region within the three cultivars . this strategy will improve the single genetic map. genomic regions of many snp and dart markers can be genotyped without special instruments if converted to indel markers. in addition, annotated barley genes have been anchored to barley physical maps , and the genes within qtl intervals may facilitate qtl fine mapping to determine candidate genes.

CONCLUSIONS
high-density indel markers with specific genomic locations were developed and  <dig> molecular markers  were integrated into single barley genetic map based on barley genomic sequences and popseq genetic maps. genotyping indel markers by hrm technology will facilitate quick map construction. the high-density genetic map will be useful for molecular breeding and qtl mapping in barley.
