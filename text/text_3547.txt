BACKGROUND
species in the genus theileria are the causative agents of lymphoproliferative diseases in cattle. the high mortality and morbidity in cattle associated with these diseases cause devastating socio-economic losses  <cit> . the species that cause the largest economic burden are t. parva, which causes east coast fever, and t. annulata, which causes tropical theileriosis. both species are transmitted by ticks and have complex intracellular life-cycles  <cit> . two intracellular stages follow the introduction of sporozoite stage into mammalian hosts, the intra-lymphocytic schizont stage and the intra-erythrocytic piroplasm stage. the schizont stage has a unique ability to cause infected host cells to proliferate indefinitely, resulting in a leukemia-like phenotype  <cit> . stage differentiation takes place at the time of parasite transmission to and from hosts, as well as during their establishment and amplification within the host. it has been shown that the molecular regulation of stage differentiation could be targeted for the development of new disease control strategies  <cit> . one such target are the regulators of gene expression, since they may determine the progression through life-cycle stages. however, little is known about the extent of, and the elements involved in, transcriptional regulation in these protozoan parasites.

theileria species are among several thousand unicellular eukaryotic parasites in the phylum apicomplexa, whose members include plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly causative agent of malaria, and toxoplasma gondii, one of the most successful parasites, infecting more than 30% of the human population and imposing a severe threat to immuno-compromised individuals. apicomplexans are thought to have reduced transcriptional machinery relative to multicellular eukaryotes. the highly biased nucleotide composition of the apicomplexan genomes sequenced to date hamper the detection of bona fide regulatory elements  <cit> , thus making it difficult to assess the extent of that reduction. classical eukaryotic promoter elements such as the tata-box and the caat-box appear to be absent in t. gondii and p. falciparum  <cit> . general transcription factors such as tfiia and most of the tata-binding protein associated factors are not found in apicomplexan genomes  <cit> . instead, non-canonical regulatory motifs are correlated with gene expression in t. gondii  <cit> . however, recent studies that take into account the genome composition and/or the timing of gene expression are uncovering novel conserved sequence motifs, leading to a considerable expansion of the repertoire of known and putative transcription regulators in this phylum  <cit> . in t. parva, a massively parallel signature sequencing  study indicates that the majority of genes are transcriptionally active in the schizont stage, but their transcription may not be stringently regulated and, instead, vary stochastically between different host cells or time points. active regulation of transcription was observed only at certain classes of loci  <cit> . in t. annulata, mobility shift assays have identified an element upstream of the tams <dig> gene that is a site of dna-protein interactions during differentiation to the merozoite  <cit> .

the complex life-cycle of theileria poses a serious challenge to the development of a workable laboratory system, thus making it difficult to study the regulatory mechanism and developmental biology of this organism. recently, the genome sequences of t. parva and t. annulata were published  <cit> , enabling the study of the unique biological characteristics of theileria parasites using systematic and global bioinformatics approaches. the genomes of t. parva and t. annulata are ~ <dig> mb long, with approximately  <dig> genes each, identified through both automated and manual annotation. the gene density in these two genomes is fairly high, with the annotated coding sequences comprising ~70% of the nuclear dna, introns ~10% and the remaining 20% consisting of intergenic regions   <cit> . the short length of theileria igrs, which average ~ <dig> base pairs , again suggests a different mechanism of transcriptional regulation from those found in multi-cellular eukaryotes. more importantly, these compact igrs allow us to assess the feasibility of finding regulatory sequences with an exhaustive scan of the non-coding segment of the genome, and in the absence of comprehensive gene expression data.

in the current work, we try to understand the evolutionary forces that determine the characteristic of non-coding regions in theileria, such as length, nucleotide composition and degree of conservation. selective constraint is calculated based on alignment of orthologous igrs and introns of t. parva and t. annulata. in particular, this study aimed to test whether sequence conservation in general, and conserved sequence motifs in particular, are most common in igrs flanked by genes in head-to-head orientation, as expected if transcriptional regulation is an important component in the regulation of gene expression in theileria. we apply a de novo motif discovery algorithm to identify putative cis-regulatory elements in igrs and compare their conservation in two species. candidate motifs are then characterized based on their location relative to transcription start sites and the function of neighboring genes in t. parva, their similarity to known transcription factor binding sites, and their distribution pattern in different non-coding genomic regions. in this first comprehensive study of non-coding sequence evolution and motif discovery in theileria, we have demonstrated that selection favors short introns and igrs, and identified conserved sequence motifs whose role in gene regulation can now be tested by experimental approaches.

RESULTS
characterization of non-coding dna in t. parva and t. annulata
the length and "guanine and cytosine"  content of introns and igrs are similarly distributed in t. parva  and t. annulata . igr length fits a lognormal distribution with estimated modal value of  <dig> bp . the positive skew in the length distribution suggests that selective pressure maintains igrs small, possibly to minimize genome size. alternatively, such a distribution could result from the sporadic accumulation of large insertions in igrs that are gradually eroded by more frequent deletions. the distribution of intron length is also right-skewed, but it is bimodal, similar to what is observed in other eukaryotes  <cit> . this suggests the presence of two distinct classes of introns: short introns, which make up the majority of the sample, with a modal value at  <dig> bp, and long introns, with a modal value of  <dig> bp. the distribution of gc content is approximately normal for both introns and igrs . the average gc content across all igrs is  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in t. parva and t. annulata, respectively, while the average in introns is slightly lower . the gc content in non-coding regions is ~10% lower than the overall genome gc content in these species, which is approximately  <dig> % in t. parva and  <dig> % in t. annulata  <cit> . this difference suggests a mutational bias towards adenine and thymine  and/or the accumulation of at-rich regulatory motifs in non-coding regions of the genome.

in order to study the evolution of non-coding regions, homologous sequence segments between species are required. establishing homology between non-coding regions is often difficult due to the lack of conserved landmarks that results from the accumulation of insertions, deletions and substitutions. in addition, the exact location of igrs and introns is uncertain due to the probabilistic nature of the gene models generated through automated annotation. for this study, we identified a high-quality subset of introns and igrs for which homology could be inferred with high probability . the remaining analyses in this section were performed on this data subset, unless otherwise noted. the gc content in this subset of igrs and introns  is lower than the overall average, suggesting that coding regions that have not yet been identified are present in regions currently identified as non-coding.

each value of length, gc content and selective constraint is the mean ± sem.

igrs can be classified into three classes based on the orientation of the genes that flank them: 5'-5', 3'-3' or 5'-3', when surrounded respectively by two start codons, two termination codons or a start and a stop codon of successive genes. the length and gc content distributions differ significantly among igr classes . igr length increases with increasing number of start codons  flanking it . this could be due to errors in determining the correct start codon, with the resulting gene models being consistently shorter than the true genes. this hypothesis seems unlikely, as it would result in igrs enriched with coding segments, which in turn should increase gc content. in fact, the opposite trend in gc content is observed. in igrs, gc content decreases with the number of flanking start codons, such that 5'-5' igrs have the lowest %gc, 3'-3' igrs have the highest %gc, and %gc of 3'-5' igrs falls in between those of the other two classes . a more likely explanation for the length trend among the three igr classes is the preferential accumulation of functional motifs upstream of genes, causing 5'-5' igr to be longest and 3'-3' igrs to be the shortest. this hypothesis is supported by the significant difference in selective constraint across igr classes .

intron length has been shown to be negatively correlated to intron ordinal number in arabidopsis and in murids  <cit> , a pattern that can be attributed to the uneven distribution of functional dna elements across introns, with larger fractions present towards the 5' end of genes. a similar relationship is observed in theileria, with the average length for first introns being  <dig> bp, and that value gradually decreasing to  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp for intron ordinal number  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and ≥  <dig>  respectively . in addition, gc content is positively related with intron position . both intron length and gc content differ significantly among different classes of introns .

the degree of selective constraint was estimated for each high-quality, orthologous intron pair  and igr pair , based on individual global alignments. our results show the degree of conservation to be higher in igrs than in introns . interestingly, selective constraint in igrs of t. parva increases with the number of start codons that flank it , and decreases with intron ordinal number . the difference is statistically significant among different classes of igrs and among introns . these results point to the accumulation of functional motifs upstream of genes and also in introns that are closer to the 5' end of genes, and are consistent with the assertion of a direct relationship between the length of non-coding regions and the frequency of functional motifs.

conserved sequence motifs and their biological relevance
using meme, we mined the  <dig> nucleotides proximal to the 5' end of all genes in either t. parva or t. annulata for enriched motifs. given the average igr length of ~ <dig> bp, this length restriction used in the initial motif search should adequately capture relevant regulatory regions, while at the same time minimizing the probability of motifs affecting neighboring genes. table  <dig> lists the top five statistically significant motifs found in each species. motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in t. parva and motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> in t. annulata are found in hundreds of copies per genome in the upstream region of genes, while the frequency of other two motifs is an order of magnitude lower . motif comparison indicates that top three motifs in t. parva are almost identical to motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in t. annulata . we further investigated the biological relevance of these three conserved motifs using transcription start site  and gene functional annotation information.

motifs are identified by meme and their consensus sequences are shown here using iupac  nucleic acid codes. information content in bits is calculated based on the first-order markov background model. the e-value estimates the number of motifs with the same width and number of occurrence that would have equal or higher likelihood in the same number of random sequences generated by the background model. sites refer to the number of sequences that meme used to build each motif model.

first, we looked for an association between putative motifs and the transcriptional process by determining whether they had a fixed position relative to the tss  <cit> . putative tsss have been determined for  <dig> t. parva genes based on est mapping, and on average map  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the start codon. t. parva motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were present in igrs next to, respectively,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with a defined utr. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of three motifs relative to the tss. the distribution of motif  <dig> is remarkably restricted, with motifs almost exclusively located within  <dig> bases upstream of the tss. motif  <dig> is also enriched in this region, with more than 50% of the sequences located within this  <dig> bp range. however, the distribution of motif  <dig> is relatively flat, with ~70% of the sequences located upstream of the tss and the remaining 30% located between the tss and the initiation codon .

next, we investigated the biological relevance for each motif in the context of the function of adjacent genes. a hypergeometric test demonstrated that certain functional categories are significantly enriched among genes downstream of motifs  <dig> and  <dig> , but not of motif  <dig>  motif  <dig> is associated with genes involved in protein synthesis, with telomeric orfs, and with proteins containing signal peptides, while motif  <dig> is associated with genes related to protein fate . using stamp  <cit> , we identified known motifs that are most similar to each of the three theileria motifs. motif  <dig> has similarity to a dna consensus binding site for myeloid zinc finger protein  <dig> , a c2h <dig> zinc finger transcription factor involved in granulopoiesis, cellular proliferation and oncogenesis  <cit>  . in addition, motif  <dig> is identical to the motif atggggc, which has been identified independently in different studies in plasmodium  <cit>  and which may be preferentially associated with metabolic genes that are highly expressed during the trophozoite stage  <cit> . for motif  <dig>  stamp detected a highly similar sequence element that is known to interact with a nuclear protein in a plant species  <cit>  . it is also nearly identical with a p. falciparum conserved motif tgtgt which, much like motif  <dig>  has a widespread genome distribution  <cit> . motif  <dig> has significant similarity to the binding site for nf-κb, a family of transcription factors whose activation has been shown to be associated with host invasion in various pathogens, including t. parva  <cit>  .

finally, we investigated the distribution pattern of three motifs across the entire t. parva genome. mast was used to detect occurrence of each motif in coding regions , introns, and the three types of igrs, at different probability thresholds. all three motifs were found more often in 5'-5' and 5'-3' igrs than in the other regions . together with the higher selective constraints observed in igrs bordered by 5' ends of genes, these results are consistent with the presence of regulatory motifs in the upstream region of genes. although the average length of cds  is much longer than that of igrs , the frequency of the three motifs is higher in 5'-5' and 3'-5' igrs than in cds . this distribution pattern provides an additional evidence for the biological significance of our putative motifs. in addition to its presence in igrs flanked by at least one start codon, motif  <dig> is also found in 3'-3' igrs and in introns, revealing a widespread distribution throughout non-coding regions of the t. parva genome.

discussion
the fraction of non-coding dna in the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes is between 6% and 14%, but close to 90% in multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> . single-celled eukaryotes have a higher proportion of non-coding dna than prokaryotes, but a much more compact genome than multicellular eukaryotes. the smallest known nuclear genome, that of a chlorarachniophyte nucleomorph, contains 22% intergenic dna  <cit> , and the single-celled model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae, the budding yeast, contains 30% intergenic dna  <cit> . intron length and number varies among taxa, and dramatic difference can be seen across related species. approximately 40% of genes contain introns in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, while only 4% of genes have introns in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the non-protein coding regions of multi-cellular eukaryotes include the remnants of transposable elements that have lost functionality, ribosomal genes, motifs involved in gene regulation and chromosomal structure and possibly other unknown functions. only a few eukaryotic unicellular parasites have so far been shown to contain transposable elements  <cit> , and many of these organisms are known to lack transposable elements all together  <cit> , which probably explains much of the observed difference in the amount of non-coding dna between these organisms and other eukaryotes. however, non-coding regions of these small parasitic genomes remain remarkably understudied, and little is known about the forces that shape them.

the genome of theileria species is highly compact. non-coding sequences make up ~30% of the genome, as the average length of both introns and igrs is smaller than that of many eukaryote genomes, and no transposable elements have so far been found. our results show that a large fraction of non-coding dna is kept constant due to purifying selection . this high conservation rate confirms the functional importance of non-coding sequences in theileria, which goes beyond a role as passive intergenic spacers. this assertion is further supported by the higher degree of sequence conservation in igrs that border the 5' end of genes relative to what is observed in igrs flanked by termination codons, since igr sequence conservation between species in regions upstream of genes is associated with the presence of regulatory elements  <cit> . the presence of functionally important motifs at higher frequencies in 5'-5' igrs relative to 3'-3' igrs limits the fixation of deletion events in the former regions, which in turn remain longer.

introns play an important role in gene transcription regulation and mrna processing, and functional elements are often found in first introns  <cit> . first introns tend to be longer and more conserved than introns of higher ordinal number, a pattern observed both in mammals  <cit>  and in invertebrates  <cit> . our analyses yielded a similar result in theileria, extending this pattern to unicellular eukaryotes for the first time. these results also suggest the accumulation of functional elements towards the 5' end of theileria genes.

the study of transcriptional regulation in apicomplexan parasites has identified some unique features of this large group of protists. canonical elements seem to be absent from promoter regions, while non-canonical regulatory elements in upstream regions have been found to be involved in the regulation of gene expression. transcriptome analysis has demonstrated active regulation of transcription in t. parva  <cit> , but no regulatory elements or transcription factors have been identified so far.

in this study, we found three putative motifs that are present in hundreds of copies throughout the genome. two of them, motifs  <dig> and  <dig> in t. parva, are preferentially located in the  <dig> nucleotides upstream of tss, suggesting that they may be transcription factor binding sites in this species. motif  <dig> appears to be enriched near telomere-associated orfs and signal peptide-containing proteins. while the function of telomeric orfs in theileria, so called due to their extreme proximity to telomeres, remains unknown they encode hyper-polymorphic gene families  <cit> . in plasmodium, gene families with these characteristics are known to be important to pathogenesis and antigenic variation  <cit> . in fact, a large fraction of t. parva's telomeric orfs expressed in the schizont stage contain predicted signal sequences, consistent with their involvement in host-parasite interaction  <cit> . the current discovery of a putative regulatory element preferentially located in upstream regions of telomeric orfs may help the functional study and design of molecular tools to manipulate this important group of proteins in theileria. based on a mips classification of t. parva proteins  <cit> , we detected an association of this motif with genes involved in protein synthesis, and database searches indicated that it is similar to a dna consensus binding site for myeloid zinc finger protein  <dig> , a c2h <dig> zinc finger transcription factor involved in cellular proliferation and oncogenesis  <cit> . the finding of an identical motif in plasmodium associated with genes that are highly expressed during phases of rapid cellular multiplication makes it tempting to speculate whether motif  <dig> may be the binding site for an unidentified transcription factor in theileria associated with protein synthesis and/or cell division.

motif  <dig> appears to be associated with genes that are involved in protein modification, stabilization, degradation, targeting, sorting, translocation, and other protein fate-related functions. it is similar to the binding site for nf-κb transcription factors, which has been shown to be involved in host cell transformation mechanisms in various pathogens, including theileria  <cit> . the schizont stage of t. parva induces sustained activation of nf-κb, which regulates the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses  <cit> , proliferation  <cit> , and survival  <cit> . pathogens may also utilize the nf-κb system to enhance their own replication, survival, and dissemination within the host  <cit> . for example, nf-κb binding sites have been found in the enhancer region of the long terminal repeat  <cit>  and 5' utr  <cit>  of human immunodeficiency virus , through which host nf-κb promotes viral replication and survival. although no homolog to human nf-κb has been identified in theileria, it is conceivable that a transcription factor with a similar binding motif to that used by nf-κb might exist in these species. to that effect we searched the t. parva protein-coding genes for peptides with homology to the ipt domain of nf-κb, which is involved in dna binding. our blastp analysis uncovered a significant match  to a hypothetical protein, tp02- <dig>  which has 33% identity and 55% similarity to the dna-binding domain of nf-κb. a support vector machine-based algorithm predicted tp02- <dig> to be a dna-binding protein  <cit> . this result, together with the distribution characteristics of motif  <dig>  suggests that attempting the experimental validation of this motif is warranted.

in contrast with the previous two motifs, motif  <dig> is found throughout non-coding regions, without a localized distribution relative to tss or specific protein functional classes. however, an almost identical motif has been demonstrated to interact with a nuclear protein in developing rape seeds  <cit> , suggesting the role of our motif as a binding site for regulatory proteins other than transcription factors. interestingly, our motif is highly similar to a conserved motif in p. falciparum that also has a widespread genome distribution  <cit> . while it is possible that this sequence pattern is a characteristic feature of apicomplexan genomes, its function remains unknown.

as more theileria genome sequences become available, the search for conserved motifs in non-coding sequences will have added power. a comprehensive list of conserved elements may be derived by combining phylogenetic footprinting and de novo pattern matching algorithms. various experimental approaches are available for the verification of putative regulatory elements, including in vitro protein binding experiments, in vivo dna structure assays, and reverse genetics methods. in particular electrophoretic mobility shift essays have been documented to work well in apicomplexan systems  <cit> . revealing the functional potential of these conserved elements will advance the study of gene regulation in theileria and possibly lead to the improved control and therapeutics for east coast fever and tropical therileriosis in cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
the highly compact genome of theileria seems to result from selection pressure for small introns and igrs. while, much like in other apicomplexan genomes, classical eukaryotic promoter elements have not been found in theileria, genome-wide de novo searches identified several conserved sequence motifs in igrs. two putative t. parva motifs have localized distribution relative to transcriptional start sites and are preferentially associated with specific protein functions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they participate in transcriptional regulation in this eukaryotic parasite. the fact that conserved motifs with similar sequence are found in plasmodium hints at the possibility of common regulatory mechanisms across the phylum apicomplexa.
