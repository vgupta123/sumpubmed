BACKGROUND
superantigens  are microbial toxins of bacterial and viral origin with the ability to activate 5–20% of the t cell population, causing t cell activation, cytokine release and systemic shock  <cit> . most sags share the ability to simultaneously bind the class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules and the variable region of the t cell receptor β-chain, without the need to be processed by antigen presenting cells  <cit> . thus seb can interact directly with mhc class ii molecules on apcs and activate t cells bearing the proper tcr vβ chains. the result of this interaction is large-scale stimulation of any t cell that expresses the proper tcr vβ chain. a number of studies have shown that when mice are challenged with a sag such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b , toxicity results from massive induction of cytokines derived from t-helper-type- <dig>  type cells such as il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α and tnf-β  <cit> . this cytokine production is accompanied by expansion of the numbers of seb reactive t cells, followed by cell death and the induction of functional "anergy"  <cit> .

in order for a t cell to be activated antigen presenting cells  must present antigen, either an antigenic peptide or sag. in vitro, this interaction with the tcr has been shown to lead to the activation of a number of tyrosine kinases, including the src family kinase lck, the syk family kinase zap- <dig> and the tec family kinase itk . this then results in the activation of a number of signaling pathways including members of the mapk family of kinases, erk, jnk and p <dig>  followed by transcription factor activation  <cit> . in vivo, activation of these t cells lead to the induction of cytokine secretion within hours of seb exposure  <cit> .

itk is expressed primarily in t cells, nk cells and mast cells  <cit> . in t cells, it is rapidly activated following tcr crosslinking in vitro  <cit> . mice lacking itk exhibit reduced proliferation and il- <dig> production in vitro, and reduced t cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo, with th <dig> cell differentiation preferentially affected  <cit> . the observed reduced proliferation of itk null t cells in vitro is il- <dig> dependent as it could be rescued by the addition of exogenous il- <dig>  <cit> . however, these animals are not entirely immunocompromised, with residual responses against lcm, vaccinia and vs viruses  <cit> . we have tested whether itk null mice are susceptible to seb induced il- <dig> secretion. we show here that mice lacking itk have much reduced il- <dig> production and t cell expansion in response to seb in vitro and in vivo. we also show that seb induced the activation of the jnk mapk pathway in responding t cells in vivo, and that itk null t cells were defective in the activation of this pathway in vivo. however, toxicity analysis indicated that both wt and itk null animals were similarly affected by seb exposure. our data suggest that itk is required for full il- <dig> secretion following seb exposure, and that this may be due to the regulation of the jnk pathway by itk in vivo. however, reducing t cell signals does not necessarily lead to better physiological responses to seb exposure.

RESULTS
itk deficient t cells proliferate less efficiently than wt t cells in response to varying concentrations of seb in vitro
it has previously been reported that t cells from mice lacking itk exhibit much reduced proliferation in response to anti-cd <dig> or tcr antibodies in vitro  <cit> . by contrast, these t cells did not have any defects and actually had higher proliferative responses following anti-cd28/pma stimulation  <cit> . these data do not provide clear answers as to whether itk would present a good target for inhibition of seb induced t cell activation in vivo, and in particular, in the cytokine response observed following sag exposure. we therefore first tested whether itk null t cells could respond to seb stimulation by proliferation in vitro. pooled splenocytes and lymph node cells from wt or itk null animals were cultured in vitro in the presence of varying concentrations of seb , and proliferation analyzed over a 5-day period. we found that wt cells responded normally by proliferating between days  <dig> and  <dig>  with maximum proliferation observed at day  <dig> and the  <dig> μg/ml dose of seb . analysis of the dose response at  <dig> days indicated that the wt cells responded in a dose dependent fashion . by contrast, cells from itk mice showed very little response, regardless of the dose of seb used for stimulation . we next determined if the same results would be obtained in purified t cell populations from these mice. t cells were purified from wt and itk null mice, and stimulated with varying dose of seb, in the presence of apcs. analysis of the data over the  <dig> days indicated that in the presence of the highest concentration of seb tested , wt t cells responded more robustly than itk null t cells . indeed, at all the doses tested, our analysis indicated that itk null t cells responded less than wt t cells on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , while proliferation was equivalent when pma and ionomycin was used to bypass tcr signals . these data indicate that itk null t cells have significantly reduced proliferative responses to seb in vitro.

itk null t cells secrete less il- <dig> in response to seb in vitro
interleukin- <dig> is one of the cytokines induced by exposure to seb  <cit> . itk has been shown to regulate il- <dig> secretion in vitro by t cells stimulated anti-cd3/tcr antibodies or in response to peptide antigen  <cit> . we therefore determined the levels of il- <dig> in supernatants from cells similarly stimulated with seb in vitro . while wt t cells responded to seb by secretion of il- <dig> within  <dig> hrs. of stimulation in a dose dependent manner , starting at the  <dig>  μg/ml seb concentration , itk null t cells made very little il- <dig>  and the small amount of il- <dig> that was made was only at the highest concentration of seb tested . itk null t cells consistently secreted less il- <dig> over the 5-day period and dose range . these data indicate that as previously reported for tcr or antigenic stimulation, itk regulates the production of il- <dig> in vitro in response to seb stimulation  <cit> .

reduced expansion of vβ8+cd4+ population in itk null animals in response to seb exposure in vivo
while these data indicate that itk regulates t cell proliferation in response to seb in vitro, it is possible that within the context of antigen presentation and optimal co-stimulatory signals in vivo, itk null t cells may exhibit a better response. exposure of animals to seb results in an expansion of the seb reactive t cell population with a peak of around  <dig> days post exposure  <cit> . in order to determine if the reduced proliferative responses seen with the itk null t cells in vitro was also seen in vivo, we exposed wt and itk null animals to seb and determined the percentages of vβ <dig> and vβ <dig> positive cells in the cd4+ population by flow cytometry after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days as a measure of t cell expansion. t cells bearing vβ <dig> tcr chains are responsive to seb stimulation while those that bear vβ <dig> tcr chains are not, so we analyzed these two populations of t cells. as previously reported, in wt animals, we observed an approximately  <dig> fold expansion in vβ <dig> cd4+  t cells in spleen and lymph nodes following seb exposure , while vβ <dig> cd4+ t cell populations were largely unchanged . by contrast, there was statistically significantly less expansion of itk null vβ8+cd4+ t cells following seb exposure, although these cells still expanded  as previously reported, the percentages of t cells bearing vβ <dig> did not change over this period in either the wt or itk null mice . thus the absence of itk results in reduced t cell expansion in vivo in response to seb. 

defective seb induced il- <dig> secretion in vivo in itk null mice
t cells from itk null mice proliferate less in vitro and in vivo, and secrete significantly less il- <dig> in vitro in response to seb. we therefore determined if they would also secrete less il- <dig> following seb stimulation in vivo. groups of mice were exposed to seb i.v. and at various time points their serum was taken and analyzed for il- <dig> production. we found that in comparison to in vitro il- <dig> production, when wt mice were exposed to seb in vivo they produced il- <dig> within  <dig> hr., which peaked at around  <dig> hrs. . in addition, consistent with the in vitro stimulation, itk deficient mice secrete significantly less il- <dig> in response to seb in vivo . based on these data we conclude that in vivo il- <dig> production occurs earlier than observed in vitro, and that itk null t cells continue to exhibit defects in il- <dig> production in response to seb in vivo, even in the presumed presence of adequate costimulatory signals in vivo.

defective phosphorylation of c-jun induced by seb in itk null t cells
the jnk mapk pathway has been shown to be essential for il- <dig> production upon stimulation of t cells by the tcr and cd <dig> in vitro  <cit> . this pathway leads to phosphorylation of c-jun and activation of an ap- <dig> transcription factor complex that is required for il- <dig> transcription  <cit> . while activation of the jnk pathway leading to phosphorylation and activation of c-jun has been demonstrated in t cells following tcr and cd <dig> crosslinking in vitro, as well as by peptide antigen stimulation in vivo, it is not clear whether the sag seb activates this pathway in vivo  <cit> . we therefore tested whether seb could induce phosphorylation of c-jun in wt t cells stimulated with seb in vivo. to do this, we adapted a method initially used by jenkins and colleagues to analyze phosphorylation of c-jun following in vivo exposure of antigen. in this protocol, mice were exposed to seb, then cells from lymph nodes, spleen and blood rapidly isolated and fixed, and antibodies specific for phosphorylated c-jun used to analyze its phosphorylation. in addition, cells were stained with antibodies specific to vβ <dig> or vβ <dig> to detect seb responsive and non-responsive t cells respectively. flow cytometry was employed to detect phosphorylation of c-jun  <cit> . figure  <dig> demonstrates that  <dig> hr. after intravenous exposure to seb, vβ8+ seb reactive t cells in spleen and lymph nodes contain higher levels of phosphorylated c-jun . similar results were found in animals exposed to seb i.p. . by contrast, t cells non-reactive to seb in the same animals, those bearing vβ6+ tcrs, did not have any increase in phosphorylated c-jun . this demonstrates that in the same animal, only those t cells that interact with and can be activated by seb respond by phosphorylation of c-jun, while at the same time, those t cells that are not reactive are not activated, demonstrating specificity. similarly, animals injected with pbs showed no such change in phosphorylated c-jun in either the seb reactive or non-reactive t cell populations, indicating that this was an seb mediated event . other controls including secondary reagents alone demonstrate the specificity of antibody staining .

we next determined whether t cells lacking itk could induce c-jun phosphorylation in response to seb activation in vivo. itk null mice were exposed to seb as described above, and phosphorylation of c-jun determined in vβ8+ t cell population  or vβ6+ t cell population  in the same animals. these experiments show that in the absence of itk, seb does not lead to phosphorylation of c-jun in either t cell population . thus, the absence of itk results in the lack of seb phosphorylation of c-jun, which could affect the ability of these t cells to produce il- <dig>  to determine if this lack of c-jun phosphorylation in itk null t cells in response to seb reflected global nonresponsiveness in these cells, we determined whether these cells were indeed activated by seb exposure. to do this, we measured increases in cd <dig> expression, a cell surface protein that is rapidly expressed by activated t cells in a ras/mapk dependent manner  <cit> . similar experiments were performed as those examining c-jun phosphorylation, except that we used specific antibodies against cd <dig> to determine if the seb reactive cells had been activated. figure  <dig> demonstrates that vβ8+cd4+ t cells but not vβ6+cd4+ t cells from both wt and itk null mice exhibited increases in cd <dig> expression  <dig> hours following seb exposure, indicating that in both cases, the t cells were responding to seb activation . however, seb induced cd <dig> expression on a higher percentage of vβ8+cd4+ seb responding t cells in wt mice than in itk null mice . however, there was no difference in the mfi of cd <dig> expression wt responding t cells vs. itk null responding t cells . in addition, there was no difference in the expression of cd <dig> on wt or itk null t cells . thus the lack of seb induced c-jun phosphorylation in itk null t cells seems to reflect the specific role of itk in regulating this event in response to seb exposure in vivo.

similar toxicity of seb on wt and itk null mice
exposure of mice to seb and lps results in toxicity culminating in death  <cit> . we therefore analyzed the effect of exposure to seb/lps on itk null mice. however, in contrast to the results with il- <dig> secretion and t cell expansion, both mice were affected similarly . thus the same proportion of mice became sick following exposure to seb and lps, suggesting that although the absence of itk affects il- <dig> secretion following seb exposure, its absence does not affect the ability of seb to induce sickness in these mice.

discussion
it is well established that exposure to seb results in large scale cytokine production, which in part is responsible for symptoms of exposure to this toxin  <cit> . t cells have been shown to be largely responsible for this excessive cytokine production  <cit> . current suggestions for pharmacologically blocking the symptoms of seb exposure include t cell signal transduction inhibitors such as csa and perfenidone, however, these agents have significant side effects  <cit> . here we present a promising target for inhibition il- <dig> production induced by seb exposure, the tyrosine kinase itk. we show that mice lacking itk have significantly reduced t cell expansion and il- <dig> secretion upon exposure to seb in vivo. furthermore, we show that the seb induced signaling pathway leading to c-jun phosphorylation, an indication of jnk pathway activation, is significantly reduced in itk null t cells, although these t cells could respond to seb activation by upregulating cd <dig>  and there was no difference in the overall toxicity of seb/lps in these mice compared to wt mice.

previous work performed in vitro suggests that itk is required for the anti-tcr/cd <dig> antibody mediated activation of the transcription factor nfat, via regulation of calcium influx into tcr stimulated t cells  <cit> . itk null t cells also exhibit reduced ap- <dig> dna binding activity when stimulated in vitro with anti-cd <dig> antibodies  <cit> . it has also been shown that jnk activation lies in part downstream of itk following tcr crosslinking in vitro  <cit> . however, these experiments were performed in vitro and it is not clear that effects seen in vitro would reflect what happens in vivo, since other cell-cell interactions may allow for activation of pathways that are not seen using in vitro activation with antibodies. our data however, suggest that indeed, itk lies downstream of the tcr and is required for il- <dig> secretion and c-jun phosphorylation in vivo. corroborating a role for c-jun activation in il- <dig> production, mice carrying a dominant negative c-jun have much reduced il- <dig> secretion in vitro  <cit>  . similarly, jnk has been implicated in il- <dig> secretion by t cells in vitro  <cit> . our data lend support to this idea that the jnk-c-jun pathway is involved in the production of il- <dig> by t cells in vivo.

curiously, the immunosuppresant csa has been shown to inhibit the effects of seb exposure in mice if delivered prior to seb exposure  <cit> , however it does not inhibit seb induced effects in monkeys if delivered at the same time as seb  <cit> . the effects of csa on seb induced symptoms has been suggested to be due to its effects on inhibiting il- <dig> and other cytokine production due to inhibition of activation of the transcription factor nfat  <cit> , however, csa also inhibits activation of the jnk pathway following tcr/cd <dig> and cd <dig> stimulation  <cit> , and so csa pretreatment may act to prevent early t cell activation of these pathways, thus blocking cytokine production and protecting mice from the effects of subsequent seb exposure.

mice lacking itk exhibit reduced t cell responses in vitro, but also have reduced percentages of cd4+ t cells . while this would be expected to reduced the overall t cell response in vivo to seb exposure, if these cells were able to respond to seb, we would expect an equivalent reduction in the amount of il- <dig> secreted in vivo in response to seb. we would also expect to see an equivalent reduction in proliferation in vitro. however, in vivo, we observed much reduced il- <dig> secretion, and reduced expansion of vβ8+cd4+ t cells, although this was not as dramatic as the reduction in il- <dig> secretion. indeed, it has been observed that seb induced t cell expansion in il- <dig> null mice, indicating that il- <dig> is not necessary for expansion of t cells in vivo following seb exposure. however, even with the reduced t cell responses observed in itk null mice, they still suffer from seb/lps induced toxicity similar to that seen in the wt mice. it should be noted however, that c57bl/ <dig> mice are much less sensitive to seb induce lethal shock than balb/c mice  <cit> . thus we observed very few deaths in our experiments, and itk may protect balb/c mice from actual death. we are currently crossing these mice onto the balb/c background to determine if this is the case.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have show that itk is required for il- <dig> production induced by seb in vivo and in vitro. we have also shown that itk may regulate signals leading il- <dig> production in part by regulating phosphorylation of c-jun. however, mice lacking itk exhibit similar responses to seb toxicity. the data suggest that the inability of t cell lacking itk to produce il- <dig> cannot be overcome by sag stimulation, and that perturbing t cell activation pathways leading to il- <dig> production does not necessarily lead to improved responses to seb toxicity.
