BACKGROUND
retinitis pigmentosa  is a group of hereditary retinal diseases characterised by progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. it is the most common hereditary retinal disease with a frequency of approximately  <dig> in 3000– <dig> people, with an estimated total of  <dig>  million people affected worldwide  <cit> . patients with rp usually present with a loss of night vision and complain of progressive constriction of the visual field. eventually, central vision is affected and worsens. clinical features such as age of onset and rate of progression vary greatly between individuals.

the identification of causative genetic variants is expected to be the starting point of rp treatment. genetic counselling and gene therapy or other patient-specific treatment options can be suggested based on genetic background. in addition to treating the disease, molecular diagnosis is helpful for informing the differential diagnosis. hereditary retinal dystrophies have a slowly progressive nature and complete clinical features may not be present at the time of examination. therefore, many other hereditary retinal dystrophies may be confused with rp at certain phases of disease progression.

however, the genetic heterogeneity of rp is a hurdle for the easy application of molecular diagnosis. at the time of september  <dig>   <dig> genes and  <dig> mapped loci are known to be associated with nonsyndromic rp  <cit>  . these genes show considerable phenotypic variability and multiple inherited retinal disease shares certain causative genes with rp  <cit> . because of this phenotypic heterogeneity and confusion between genotypic and phenotypic correlations, the clinical features of individual patients provide few clues to narrow down the list of candidate genes  <cit> . therefore, these genes and loci should be screened simultaneously.

massively parallel sequencing, also called next-generation sequencing  is a recent technical breakthrough in genetics  <cit> . ngs-based high-throughput sequencing even makes whole-genome sequencing available in a single facility, which would have required tremendous cost and time in the past. rp can be a good target for massively parallel sequencing as an appropriate number of candidate genes are known for rp. therefore, this study attempts to detect candidate variants in rp by applying a targeted enrichment and re-sequencing strategy.

RESULTS
quality validation of sequencing
a total of  <dig>  kbp of targeting and flanking regions from  <dig> rp-related genes and  <dig> rp-related exons were captured;  <dig>  % of the  <dig>  m reads obtained on average per individual were properly paired and mapped . the average read depth was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the captured target exons showed more than 1x and 10x coverage, respectively .

detection of variants in familial rp
strong candidate variants of rp were identified in  <dig> families . among  <dig> families,  <dig> had an autosomal dominant, five had an autosomal recessive and three had an x-linked inheritance pattern. briefly, five known pathogenic variants , was predicted as non-pathogenic. therefore, the xf <dig> family was excluded. the other five candidate variants in rp <dig>  rp <dig> and topors have not been reported in dbsnp and were co-segregated in the family members.table  <dig> strong candidate variants in familiar cases

the  <dig> variants were comprised of four nonsynonymous variants, four nonsense mutations, one frameshift deletion, and one splicing variant. all the nonsense mutations  were located at the upstream exons , which might lead to nonsense-mediated decay of mrna. a frameshift variant  was also located at the 5′ upstream exon, and all the nonsense and frameshift variants were classified as possible pathogenic variants .

the clinical features were relatively severe in patients having x-linked variants, f <dig>  and f <dig>  . the affected family members experienced early onset of symptoms and presented with rapid progression. in the f <dig> family, the proband  was a 6-year-old male whose visual acuity was 20/ <dig>  and 20/ <dig> . the visual field was mildly constricted using a goldmann perimetry v <dig> target, and the rod responses were extinguished and photopic responses were severely decreased on the electroretinogram. the photoreceptor inner segment and outer segment junction was not detectable using oct . the patient’s grandfather  had no light perception in both eyes. fundus examination and oct scan showed a severely degenerative retina. for family f <dig>  a possible pathogenic missense variant was found in the x-linked rp <dig> gene. hemizygous male patients  showed poor visual acuity at less than counting fingers. the retina was totally degenerated such that the retina and choroid were not distinguishable on oct. scoptopic and photopic electroretinogram  were all extinguished. female patients of the f <dig> family  showed variable penetrance. three of them  were confirmed to have heterozygous variants. two female patients  had mild peripheral pigmentary deposits and decreased rod and cone amplitude on electroretinography. two other female patients  showed complete expression of rp. they had visual acuity limited to light perception in both eyes, typical bony spicule pigment deposits, attenuated retinal vessels. scoptopic and photopic erg amplitude were also abolished.

f <dig>  showed a milder phenotype. in family f <dig>  all patients experienced their first symptoms in their 30s. two patients older than age  <dig>  had visual loss, while the other patients  had normal vision. patient iii- <dig> and iii- <dig> showed a normal macula on oct and a mildly constricted visual field. the clinical features of the patients and pedigrees are summarised in additional file 1: table s <dig> and figure s <dig>  fundus photograph and oct are presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

detection of variants in simplex rp
the possible pathogenic variants were also identified in  <dig> of  <dig> patients with simplex rp  . these patients denied a familial history of rp or related hereditary disorders. the inheritance pattern of candidate genes was based on the sequencing results . initially four known pathogenic variants, p.h278y in pde6b, p.y2935x and p.g2186e in eys, and p.c3416g in ush2a, were detected. . however a possible second variant in eys  and ush2a  was not found, p.y2935x  and p.c3416g  were not included in final results. eight causal candidate variants were newly identified. overall, ten possible pathogenic variants were detected. they were comprised of six nonsynonymous, three nonsense, and one frameshift insertion variants. compound heterozygous variants  were detected in five patients . the same frameshift variant of eys  was identified in two unrelated patients with simplex rp .table  <dig> strong candidate variants in sporadic cases

regarding the clinical feature, patient  <dig> with the prpf <dig> mutation  showed a mild clinical phenotype. although he was 42 years old, his visual acuity was 20/ <dig> in both eyes, but a paracentral scotoma was detected in the visual field test. the electroretinogram showed a small decrease only in rod response. most of the photoreceptor inner segment and outer segment junction  was observed intact using an oct macula scan . fundus photograph and oct are presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

discussion
in this study, targeted exome capture and massively parallel sequencing  was implemented for genetic diagnosis of rp. strong candidate variants were identified in  <dig>  of  <dig> families and  <dig>  of  <dig> sporadic patients. the overall detection rate was 50 %. this method seems to be highly efficient and cost effective in comparison with pcr amplicon sequencing and other conventional methods such as microarray analysis. it is certainly much higher than the 7–16 % detection rate of microarray genotyping . a previous genetic analysis of korean rp patients using microarrays revealed a causative mutation in  <dig> out of  <dig> patients   <cit> . the subjects of this microarray study were different from the current study. patients from the f <dig> and f <dig> families had also been screened for detection of the rho mutation by using direct sequencing in a previous study  <cit> . the current study analysed  <dig> target genes and showed exactly the same results as the direct sequencing of the rho gene for these particular individuals, thereby supporting the accuracy and efficiency of the current strategy. the current results are also comparable with other rp genetic analysis using targeted resequencing, in which the detection rate ranged from  <dig> to 82 % . unbiased sequencing, including whole-genome or exome sequencing, can provide comprehensive genetic data that reveal novel causal genes of rp such as nek <dig>  hk <dig> and mvk. however the sequencing and data processing burden is still the bottleneck for widespread use of unbiased sequencing. moreover, detection rates using whole exome sequencing have not proven to be significantly better than targeted resequencing as previously expected  <cit> . this also supports the usefulness of targeted exome sequencing in rp genetic screening.

twenty possible causal variants were detected from  <dig> genes. of these,  <dig> variants  were novel and this proportion is comparable with recent works reporting novel allele rates of 62–68 % . the considerable number of novel variants further emphasises the use of mps as a reasonable tool for rp molecular diagnosis. the prpf <dig> mutation  is most frequently found in current study, followed by mutations in eys, pde6b, rho, rp <dig>  and rp <dig> . prpf <dig> , rho , and rp <dig>  were frequently affected genes in autosomal dominant rp , whereas eys  and pde6b  were frequently affected genes for autosomal recessive rp . despite the limitation of extending this result to the general distribution of rp mutations in koreans, frequently affected genes are similar to those reported in recent works as well as previous reports by hartong et al.  <cit> . possible causal genes responsible for simplex cases had primarily autosomal recessive inheritance  as suggested previously  <cit> . it could not be confirmed whether causal alleles were de novo because segregation analysis was not able to be performed in simplex cases.

in x-linked rp, the rpgr gene is thought to be the most common causal gene, accounting for over 70 % of cases  <cit> . although the rpgr gene was included in the capture library of the present study, the candidate causal variant could not be found. orf <dig> is a mutation hotspot of rpgr, where roughly two thirds of disease-causing mutations are found  <cit> . this repetitive purine-rich orf <dig> region is rarely covered by next-generation sequencing. therefore, the rpgr mutation could have been missed and, instead, only the rp <dig> variants detected. a missense variant  in family f <dig> and a truncating variant  in family f <dig> was identified. the missense variant  was located in the conserved tubulin binding cofactor c  domain and was evolutionarily conserved. interestingly, family f <dig> showed an autosomal dominant pattern without male to male transmission. unlike the expected pattern of an x-linked disease affecting only males, recent studies have reported that rp <dig> and rpgr mutation cause variable rp phenotypes in heterozygous female patients. furthermore, it is reported that mutations in rp <dig> and rpgr account for  <dig>  % of patients with rp in provisional autosomal dominant families  <cit> .

prpf <dig> variants were identified in two families and one simplex rp patient. one splicing site variation  and truncating variant  were known pathogenic variants  <cit> . haploinsufficiency from a null allele rather than gain of function is assumed to be the major mechanism of prpf <dig> mutation-derived rp  <cit> . however, missense variants also have been suggested as possibly pathogenic in several reports . a missense variant  was also detected in a simplex rp patient  in the current study. this substitution is located at the highly conserved nosik domain and this sequence is evolutionarily conserved.

an eys variant was identified in two simplex patients. the same frameshift insertion variant  was identified in two unrelated patients. as a second candidate allele,  <dig> had a premature truncating variant  and  <dig> had a missense variant . nonsense mediated decay from a heterozygous compound truncating mutation is assumed to be a possible pathogenic mechanism in  <dig>  the missense variant  in patient  <dig> was located in the highly conserved laminin g domain. interestingly, this mutation was previously reported in a patient with korean ancestry  <cit> . a frameshift variant  and missense variant  were recurrent in a relatively small cohort and it is assumed that these could be founder variants in koreans. iwanami et al. suggested that patients having a homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutation of eys show a more severe decline of visual function than patients having only one allele of the truncating variant  <cit> . however, both cases  did not show any difference in progression in the current study independent from number of truncating variants.

a known pathogenic missense variant  of pde6b was detected in two unrelated patients . a truncating variant  was found in patient  <dig> as a second variant and a novel missense variant  was detected in patient  <dig>  this missense variant is located in the highly conserved gaf domain. loss of function of cgmp phosphoodiesterase activity is a possible mechanism in these two patients.

just one possible pathogenic allele was found in the xf <dig> family and simplex patients  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   the identified genes in these patients have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. known pathogenic variants  were found in just one allele. as a second pathogenic candadate, missense variants p.t2465s of eys and p.v2228e of ush2a were detected and predicted to be pathogenic in patient  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.  these were relatively common variants  in the genomic data of  <dig> asians. considering that the counter allele, p.y2935x and p.c3416g, is rare and pathogenic, these candidate variants may also be pathogenic alleles. regarding other cases in the current study , a second pathogenic allele could not be identified. meaningful second variants may not have been identified because they were large indels or located in an untranslated region. alternatively, detected pathogenic variants might be accidental carriers and causal variants are located in other genes. accidental carrier mutations are increasingly being reported as the use of multigenic screening with mps increases  <cit> . although the current study revealed a possible causative variant in half of cases, obviously a candidate causal allele could not be found in the other half of patients. since the target library was designed, three more causative genes have been added to the rp gene list. unknown causal genes for rp can still exist and including these targets would increase the detection yield. however, whole exome sequencing or the use of an extended target library of over  <dig> genes has not revealed a higher detection rate  <cit> . unbiased sequencing not only poses an enormous data processing burden, but also impedes deep sequencing. covering the non-coding exons of target genes and complete coverage of the target may be better way to increase diagnostic yield rather than extending the target library. eisenberg et al. reported high detection rates using high coverage, copy number variance  analysis and sequencing the 5′ utr  <cit> . xu et al. reported that complete coverage using deep sequencing and pcr amplicon for less covered regions yielded an 82 % detection rate  <cit> . although a ≥ 10x sequencing depth was reached in 96 % of the sequenced region, 4 % had a less than 10x depth and  <dig>  % was not covered . gc-rich regions or highly repetitive regions are usually under-captured by mps. the mutational hotspot, orf <dig> of rpgr, is one of those regions. complete coverage assisted by direct sequencing and deep sequencing is needed to raise the causative variant detection yield.

identifying a causal mutation is the starting point of rp treatment, followed by proper genetic counselling and prognostic data. for instance, patients can be informed that they have a certain mutation, which puts them at risk for rapid progression of rp, and aggressive therapy can be initiated on the basis of confirmative genetic data, although there are limited treatment options available to help rp patients as of yet. gene therapy, one of the possible treatment options for rp, is largely dependent on genetic data, indicating that identifying the causal mutation will become an increasingly important step in rp treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
using the targeted re-sequencing of known genes for rp, pathogenic and possibly pathogenic variants were identified in more than the half of patients and families. this strategy will become an increasingly efficient and cost-effective molecular diagnostic test for retinitis pigmentosa.
