BACKGROUND
oxidation reactions are essential for life, but they produce reactive oxygen species that can cause significant damage to cells. therefore, complex protection systems have evolved based on antioxidants that help to eliminate these dangerous molecules  <cit> . oxidative stress plays a role in many human diseases, but its impact can be reduced by the consumption of dietary antioxidants such as ascorbic acid , which is also known as vitamin c  <cit> . humans and other primates are unable to synthesize asa because the final step in its biosynthesis is blocked. therefore, there has been great interest in the development of genetically modified food crops with high levels of antioxidants such as asa  <cit> . as well as providing health benefits to humans, higher asa levels improve both biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in plants  <cit>  and enhance postharvest fruit quality  <cit> . the amount of asa in plant cells depends on the strict regulation of its synthesis  <cit> , metabolic recycling and degradation  <cit> , and its transport  <cit> . the recycling of asa is particularly important under stress conditions because reduced asa is converted into an unstable radical , which dissociates into asa and dehydroascorbic acid. since the latter is also unstable and is rapidly degraded, the asa pool can be depleted if the oxidized forms are not recovered by two reductases: monodehydroascorbic acid reductase  and dehydroascorbic acid reductase   <cit> . both enzymes have been targeted by genetic engineering, their overexpression leading to elevated asa levels  <cit>  and, in the case of mdhar, increased stress tolerance  <cit> .

although several metabolic pathways converge to generate asa in plants  <cit>  the l-galactose wheeler-smirnoff pathway is considered the primary route  and the roles of many of the genes and enzymes have been confirmed  <cit> . l-gulose  <cit>  and myo-inositol have also been proposed as intermediates in asa biosynthesis, indicating that part of the animal pathway could also operate in plants  <cit> . an alternative pathway with an l-galactonic acid intermediate has been also reported in strawberry  <cit>  and grape fruit  <cit> .

although tomato fruits are considered a good dietary source of asa, cultivated varieties of solanum lycopersicum tend to have much lower levels than wild progenitors such as s. pennellii  <cit> . this reflects a range of genetic and environmental factors that result in quantitative variation across varieties and wild species  <cit> . the asa content of tomato fruits is therefore suitable for qtl analysis  <cit> . differences among several varieties have been described based on the metabolite content and antioxidant activities  <cit> , but the precise genetic mechanisms controlling asa levels remain elusive. some insight has been gained by introgressing segments of the s. pennellii genome into a s. lycopersicum background  <cit>  and identifying qtls for fruit asa content  <cit> .

as tomato genomic resources have become more abundant  <cit> , it has been possible to investigate the transcriptional control of fruit soluble solid content  by studying the transcriptomic changes in introgression lines with different brix levels  <cit> . this type of analysis could also provide insight into the genetic mechanisms controlling asa metabolic pathways. when this investigation began,  <dig>  tomato tentative consensus sequences  were available in the tigr database gene index release  <dig>  . this facilitated the fabrication of the combimatrix tomatarray  <dig> , a versatile tomato oligonucleotide microarray containing  <dig>  specific 35- <dig> mers, each replicated four times  <cit> . using this platform, we set out to determine whether the higher asa levels in the fruits of an introgression line were associated with specific changes in steady state mrna levels, which might provide some insight into the transcriptional regulation of asa synthesis. several genes with differential expression between the introgression line and the parental cultivated variety were identified, allowing us to develop a unified model that explains asa synthesis in terms of the regulation of specific functional groups of genes.

RESULTS
ascorbic acid content
within the framework of a research project to investigate qtls controlling tomato fruit quality, we analyzed a number of introgression lines in which segments of the s. pennellii genome were introgressed into s. lycopersicum cv. m <dig>  we selected il12- <dig> for further analysis because it maintained differences in asa levels compared to the parental genotypes m <dig> and s. pennellii over three consecutive trials  in a greenhouse environment .

the average asa concentrations in ripe m <dig> and s. pennellii fruit were  <dig> and  <dig> μg g- <dig> fresh weight , respectively, whereas in il 12- <dig> the average asa concentration was  <dig> μg g- <dig> fw. these differences were statistically significant , and dunnet's post-hoc test revealed significant differences when il12- <dig> and s. pennellii were separately compared with m <dig> . a significant genotype × year interaction over the three consecutive trials was also observed . our analysis therefore confirmed that the introgression of s. pennellii genetic material into il12- <dig> contributed to the higher fruit asa content compared to m <dig>  indeed, the asa content in il12- <dig> fruit was on average 45% higher than m <dig> in  <dig>  55% higher in  <dig> and 87% higher in  <dig>  therefore, il12- <dig> was chosen for further comparative transcriptome analysis together with the parental line m <dig> 

comparative microarray analysis
in order to identify transcripts expressed at different levels in the two selected genotypes, total rna was extracted from three biological replicate samples taken from each genotype in two consecutive years . differential transcript accumulation was documented using single-color hybridization on the tomatarray  <dig>  microarray followed by a two-factorial anova test  with the m <dig> transcriptome as a reference. because small changes in gene expression might underlie differences in asa accumulation, differentially-expressed transcripts were not filtered using a fold-change threshold, and differences were considered irrespective of the intensity of the change. thus we identified  <dig> sequences  that were differentially expressed at the red-ripe stage ,  <dig> % of which significantly matched  with non-annotated sequences in the ncbi's non-redundant nr database and  <dig> % of which showed no matches. among these transcripts,  <dig>  were upregulated and  <dig>  were downregulated in il 12- <dig> 

the distribution of go categories according to biological process , molecular function  and cellular component  was complex. the bp terms "transport", "cellular component organization and biogenesis" and "amino acid and derivative metabolic process" were the highest ranked  and were similarly represented among both the upregulated and downregulated genes . the mf terms "hydrolase activity", "protein binding" and "nucleotide binding" occurred most frequently  and again were similarly represented among the upregulated and downregulated genes . finally, the most frequent cc terms indicated that the differentially expressed genes were preferentially active in the "plastid" , "mitochondrion"  and "ribosome"  . notably, this preferential order was preserved for downregulated genes but not for upregulated genes, perhaps because of the paucity of the latter group .

hierarchical clustering  using pearson's correlation metric identified sub-clusters of tightly co-regulated transcripts, which should provide new insights in to the transcriptional regulation of asa metabolism and provide putative functions for non-annotated sequences. among the transcripts that are upregulated in il 12- <dig>  the hc output indicated a sub-cluster that grouped together sequences such as a propionyl carboxylase beta chain , two pyridoxal-phosphate dependent trpb-like enzymes , a pectinesterase family protein , a 21-kda protein precursor  and a number of non-annotated transcripts. another cluster brought together ethylene-related transcripts such as a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  and a cystathionine γ-synthase , with an amino acid permease-like protein , a dnaj-like chaperone protein , a phosphoglycerate kinase  and again a number of non-annotated transcripts. in contrast, among the transcripts that are downregulated in il 12- <dig> , an asa peroxidase  was coregulated with a sec23-sec <dig> transport family protein , a β-glucosidase , a dof zinc finger protein , a selt-like protein precursor  and a small number of non-annotated transcripts.

based on functional annotation, gene ontology  classification and hierarchical clustering, a subset of the  <dig> differentially-expressed tcs  was used to develop a model that could explain the higher asa content in il 12- <dig>  within this select group, four tcs were related to asa pathways, six to hormone metabolism, five to glycolysis and the calvin cycle and three to glutathione metabolism. together, these help to characterize the essential changes in il 12- <dig> cellular metabolism that may underpin the increased accumulation of asa in the fruits. a further six tcs involved in stress responses and three involved in plastid metabolism could also be linked into the model.

expression of transcripts related to asa metabolism
among the different asa synthesis pathways mentioned above, our microarray data ruled out the wheeler-smirnoff pathway as the predominant source of higher asa levels in il 12- <dig> fruit because probes specific for genes controlling key steps in this pathway  were included on the chip and showed no evidence of differential expression. however, among  <dig> probes representing putative pectinesterase transcripts, one in particular  was  <dig> -fold more abundant in il12- <dig> than m <dig>  suggesting that increased pectin degradation could provide much of the additional asa in il 12- <dig> fruits . the breakdown of other structural polymers in the cell wall did not seem to provide intermediates for asa synthesis, e.g. transcripts for β-glucosidase  and β-glucuronidase  were repressed, which would delay the conversion of cellobiose into β-d-glucose and reduce the rate of d-glucuronic acid synthesis from β-d-glucuronoside. finally, a putative asa peroxidase transcript  was downregulated , suggesting the accumulation of asa might also reflect a lower rate of oxidation.

upregulation of pectinesterase transcript tc <dig> was confirmed in both the  <dig> and  <dig> samples by qrt-pcr . to investigate the possibility that pectin catabolism might boost asa levels, perhaps by increasing flux through the l-galactonic acid pathway, we turned our attention to the transcripts for two putative polygalacturonases , which had been overlooked in the original microarray experiment because they were filtered out of the raw data. the qrt-pcr results indicated that both were upregulated in il12- <dig> compared to m <dig> . the downregulation of two tcs involved in the d-glucuronic acid pathway  was also validated by qrt-pcr. a correlation analysis between microarray and qrt-pcr expression data  yielded a pearson's value of  <dig>  .

expression of transcripts related to ethylene metabolism
several transcripts possibly involved in ethylene biosynthesis were upregulated , including a putative cystathionine γ-synthase . the tomatarray  <dig>  included probes for six 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthases and four acc oxidases, providing a good representation of the key steps in ethylene biosynthesis. among these, only one acc synthase  was upregulated. another upregulated transcript  that was not annotated automatically was manually identified as a putative adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase, which is also involved in ethylene synthesis. in contrast, an s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase  was downregulated, which could reflect the reduced utilization of s-adenosylmethionine  for methylation and its diversion to ethylene biosynthesis. two pyridoxal phosphate-dependent trpb-like transcripts  were also upregulated . these are likely to be involved in tryptophan synthesis and thus may have an impact on the supply of 3-indoleacetic acid  with positive effects on acc synthase activity and hence ethylene biosynthesis.

expression of transcripts related to glutathione metabolism
several transcripts encoding enzymes in the glycolytic pathway were upregulated , including phosphoglycerate kinase  and a phosphofructokinase b-type carbohydrate kinase . two transcripts encoding components of the rubisco complex were also upregulated , suggesting a gene expression pattern converging on the accumulation of 3-phosphoglycerate . downregulated transcripts included a pyruvate kinase  and cysteine synthase , possibly reflecting a lower flux in gluthathione biosynthesis. consistent with this hypothesis, transcript tc <dig> putatively encoding a gluthathione s-transferase was also downregulated. a transcript encoding spermidine synthase  was also repressed, which is relevant because spermidine is a precursor of trypanothione, which spontaneously reduces dehydroascorbic acid to asa. this fits well with the coordinated downregulation of asa peroxidase  described above.

discussion
the antioxidant activity of asa makes it a crucial component of the stress response in plants  <cit> . however, the analysis of mutants deficient in asa synthesis reveals downstream effects on hundreds of genes, suggesting it is also a key signaling molecule in defense and development  <cit> . to fulfill such an important role, asa synthesis must be tightly regulated. several alternative biosynthetic pathways have been identified and it is therefore difficult to pin down exactly how synthesis is controlled in the context of development, stress responses and normal homeostasis  <cit> .

in order to determine how asa synthesis is controlled in tomato fruits we combined introgression lines previously used for qtl mapping, and transcriptome analysis using the new combimatrix microarray platform. because the asa content of tomato fruits shows quantitative variation, introgression lines involving tomato varieties with strikingly different asa levels are a useful tool to track down qtls. such lines have been generated by introgressing dna from s. pennellii, a wild tomato species with high asa levels, into the background of a common processing cultivar of s. lycopersicum , which has a lower asa content  <cit> . among six qtls affecting asa levels that were identified by rousseaux et al.  <cit> , only one  increased fruit asa concentration, and this was found in il 12- <dig>  stevens et al.  <cit>  also identified  <dig> qtls affecting fruit asa levels; eight increased the asa content but none of them was observed in il 12- <dig> 

under our experimental conditions, s. pennellii la <dig> achieved on average a  <dig> -fold increase in fruit asa levels compared to m <dig>  showing that this wild species is a useful reservoir of genetic variability for tomato fruit quality enhancement. our data confirmed those of rosseaux et al.  <cit>  who observed higher levels of asa in il12- <dig> fruits, but only in one season. the average asa content in il12- <dig> fruit is higher than that usually observed in commercial varieties  <cit> , although there are some exceptions  <cit> . the asa12- <dig> qtl therefore provided us with a valuable tool to facilitate the transcriptomic analysis of fruit asa metabolism in tomato even though asa12- <dig> does not increase asa levels to those seen in s. pennellii.

comparative microarray analysis revealed  <dig> differentially-expressed transcripts, 24% of which were upregulated in il12- <dig> fruit and 76% of which were downregulated. gene ontology classifications automatically retrieved from the go consortium  <cit>  using blast2go provided a useful framework for annotation, classification and comparison of groups of sequences according to biological process, molecular function and cellular component terms. combining functional annotation and go classifications with hierarchical clustering helped to identify groups of co-regulated transcripts. one of these  included upregulated transcripts involved in glycolysis, the calvin cycle, pectin breakdown, tryptophan synthesis and the wound response, whereas another  included downregulated transcripts involved in asa peroxidation, glucuronoside metabolism and glutathione metabolism.

overall, our results suggested that metabolic changes associated with asa accumulation in tomato fruits were focused on the l-galactonic acid and d-glucuronic acid pathways , rather than the main smirnoff-wheeler asa pathway. indeed, the upregulation of transcripts encoding a pectinesterase and two polygalacturonases suggests that the accelerated breakdown of pectin polymers may increase the availability of intermediates for the l-galactonic acid pathway, increasing the flux towards of asa biosynthesis. the importance of the l-galactonic acid pathway in asa biosynthesis was demonstrated in transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing a strawberry d-galacturonic acid reductase; the transgenic plants had higher asa levels than wild type plants, reflecting the conversion of d-galacturonic acid into l-galactonic acid as the key control point in the l-galactonic acid branch of asa metabolism  <cit> .

the above results suggest that accelerated pectin polymer breakdown increases the availability of precursors for asa biosynthesis in the l-galactonic acid pathway, resulting in the accumulation of asa in fruits. the breakdown of other cell wall polymers such as cellulose could have a similar impact, but our data strongly indicate that cellulose does not contribute to asa biosynthesis in this manner. a β-glucosidase transcript is downregulated, indicating that precursors for the d-glucuronic acid branch of the pathway would become scarcer and flux would be reduced. the coordinate downregulation of a β-glucuronidase transcript also supports the hypothesis of reduced flux through the d-glucuronic acid pathway . consistent with the hypothesis that substrate availability limits the amount of asa produced via an alternative pathway, plants with lower pectate lyase activity accumulate less asa  <cit> .

enhancing the breakdown of cell wall components therefore appears to be a useful strategy for the creation of transgenic fruit crops with higher levels of asa. however, where this has been attempted, it has often led to changes in the process of fruit softening and overall firmness. the knockdown of polygalacturonase genes delays softening and thus increases shelf life  <cit>  while making the fruits firmer  <cit> . in contrast, the knockdown of a pectin methylesterase had the opposite effect, significantly reducing shelf life  <cit> . this is in line with the reduced firmness of il12- <dig> fruit we observed at the red-ripe stage , which provides further support for pectin catabolism as the main mechanism underlying the increase in asa levels.

the higher accumulation of asa in il12- <dig> fruits may involve additional mechanisms that have not been elucidated so clearly as the pectin degradation process. for example, the upregulation of both a pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase and a phosphoglycerate kinase may indicate an increase in the catabolism of reducing monosaccharides in the cytosol. nevertheless, glycolytic flux in il12- <dig> fruit might be limited given the downregulation of a pyruvate kinase. together with the upregulation of two rubisco components, the supply of 3-phosphoglycerate may increase , leading to an increase in the synthesis of hexoses that are then made available for the asa biosynthetic pathway.

the higher asa content in il 12- <dig> fruits could also result from the reduced utilization of asa, as indicated by the downregulation of an asa peroxidase . this is also in line with the downregulation of a spermidine synthase , which would therefore be less required for dehydroascorbate regeneration to asa . accordingly, the downregulation of a pyruvate kinase and a cysteine synthase indicates that the synthesis of glutathione is repressed, while the downregulation of a gluthathione s-transferase indicates that glutathione utilization is also reduced. taken together, these results are consistent with a hypothesis based on lower overall demand for cellular antioxidant activity, in turn reducing glutathione biosynthesis and allowing asa to accumulate. additional changes to plastid metabolism are evident from the data presented in table  <dig>  including the upregulation of two rubisco proteins and an nadp ferredoxin reductase, and the downregulation of an atp synthase, all of which may be involved in reducing the abundance of reactive oxygen species by limiting the electron flux from water to nadph  <cit> . the presence of fewer reactive oxygen species is also consistent with the observed downregulation of stress response genes encoding calmodulin, a pto kinase-binding protein and a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase.

finally, given that pectin catabolism can be triggered by ethylene, we focused on the modulation of transcripts associated with the ethylene biosynthesis pathway. some of the observed changes may account for major effects on ethylene biosynthetic flux, e.g. the upregulation of a cystathionine γ-synthase, which catalyzes the first committed step in methionine biosynthesis and whose role as a key step in the regulation of ethylene metabolism has been proven in transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing a truncated cystathionine γ-synthase gene  <cit> . furthermore, the upregulation of a putative adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate transcript suggested that the efficiency of the yang cycle may be increased  <cit>  , and the downregulation of a putative s-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase suggested that adomet is being used less frequently for substrate methylations. both these changes correspond to an increase in ethylene flux, as does the upregulation of a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthase. indeed, ethylene production is tightly regulated by feedback control of acc synthase and/or acc oxidase . in tomato fruit, both acc synthase and acc oxidase activity are induced by exogenous ethylene  <cit> , and the induction is achieved by transcriptional regulation  <cit> . acc synthase may also promote ethylene biosynthesis driven by iaa  <cit> , which is consistent with our observation that two tryptophan synthase transcripts are upregulated . overall, the transcriptional modulation of genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis appears to enhance ethylene levels in il 12- <dig> fruit, which may trigger the pectin degradation that leads to asa accumulation.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative transcriptome analysis in tomato fruits from an introgression line with high levels of asa and a parent with low levels has suggested that the higher level of asa in il12- <dig> fruits may reflect a combination of increased asa synthesis and reduced utilization. in particular, the higher asa content in il 12- <dig> may be transcriptionally controlled through the upregulation of genes driving pectin degradation, thus releasing intermediates for the l-galactonic acid pathway, which is therefore likely to affect asa biosynthesis in il12- <dig> fruit. we found no evidence supporting the specific involvement of the glucuronic acid and smirnoff-wheeler pathways. the accelerated pectin degradation might itself be triggered by an increase in ethylene biosynthesis, which may be related to the upregulation of several genes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. an increase in the supply of hexoses for asa biosynthesis may also help to boost asa levels, which is suggested by the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in processes converging on 3-pga accumulation. finally, we note that several plastidial genes identified in the comparative analysis could conceivably help to reduce the abundance of reactive oxygen species, in turn preventing asa peroxidation and allowing asa to accumulate.

it will be necessary to carry out additional metabolic studies to characterize the regulatory mechanisms we have identified, and to establish the chain of events leading to asa accumulation and the trigger that induces it. we also need to determine whether asa levels can be controlled through the l-galactonic acid pathway in tomato, as this has been demonstrated only in strawberry thus far, and whether this is a specific mechanism acting only in il 12- <dig> fruit, or if it is a general mechanism controlling asa accumulation in the fruits of all tomato varieties.
