BACKGROUND
helical repeat motifs such as ank, heat, and arm are thought to primarily mediate protein-protein interactions . helical repeat motifs are a recurrent theme among regulatory subunits for different protein ser/thr phosphatases. best studied is the a or pr <dig> subunit of pp2a, an all-helical subunit first designated to consist of armadillo  sequence repeats, that were later called heat repeats  <cit> , a name derived from proteins with related sequence motifs: huntingtin's, elongation factor, a subunit of pp2a and tor. the 3d structure of the a subunit of pp2a alone  <cit> , as a dimer bound to the pp2a catalytic subunit  <cit> , and as a scaffold to assemble pp2a heterotrimers  <cit> , showed the all-helical organization and revealed differences in overall conformation due to association with the other subunits. the extended arc of helices is shaped like a banana in the monomer or heterodimer and closes to a horseshoe-shaped conformation in the heterotrimer. in addition, in the abc trimers the regulatory b' <dig> subunit of pp2a was found to be a heat-like helical repeat protein that contacts both the a and c subunits. the structure of b' <dig> was unexpected because it was not predicted based on sequence alignments with other heat-repeat proteins. another example of helical repeat motifs in protein phosphatase subunits is the mypt <dig> subunit for pp <dig>  with  <dig> ankyrin repeats  <cit> . in the 3d structure these repeats form an arc of alpha helices to engage the top surface of the pp <dig> catalytic subunit and enwrap the c-terminal tail that protrudes from the top surface of the subunit. both the ank repeats as well as a separate structural element consisting of an alpha helix plus a neighboring strand with the canonical rvxf motif make contacts with the pp <dig> catalytic subunit. based on these examples there is the expectation that other phosphatase regulatory subunits might be comprised of helical repeat structures and use these repeats to mediate subunit-subunit association.

the yeast sit <dig> phosphatase is related in sequence and properties to members of the type-2a family of protein ser/thr phosphatases  <cit> . strains with temperature-sensitive mutations  are rescued by ectopic expression of human pp <dig>  <cit> , but not the close relative pp <dig>  showing functional complementation across species, but specificity for the individual type of catalytic subunit. the results argue for distinct lines of evolutionary descent for pp2a, pp <dig> and pp <dig>  with a high degree of conservation within each line. yeast sit <dig> has multiple associated subunits that co-immunoprecipitate, first named sit4-associated proteins   <cit> . sequence alignments using a region common in the yeast sap identified saps in various species, including three human proteins , which were renamed pp6r <dig>  pp6r <dig> and pp6r <dig> and shown to co-precipitate with pp <dig>  but neither pp <dig> nor pp2a  <cit> . the sequence motif in yeast and human proteins, as well as in other species, has been designated as a "saps" domain by pfam . these saps domain proteins are proposed to function as specific regulatory subunits for pp <dig>  truncation of the c-terminal region of pp6r <dig> did not compromise co-precipitation with pp <dig>  showing that the designated saps domain was sufficient for binding the catalytic subunit.

the physiological function of this family of saps domain proteins as specific regulatory subunits is not yet well understood. knockdown of individual saps domain subunits by sirna mimics knockdown of pp <dig> catalytic subunit itself in terms of effects on putative individual substrates such as iκbε and dna-pk  <cit> . the results argue that all three saps subunits can individually associate with pp <dig>  but the different pp <dig> complexes have non-overlapping substrate specificity. the conservation of saps function in pp6r <dig>  pp6r <dig> and pp6r <dig> subunits is demonstrated by their ability to co-precipitate endogenous sit <dig> when expressed in yeast strains deleted for their endogenous saps  <cit> . furthermore, the human saps proteins partially restored functions in these strains. proteomics discovered association of pp6r <dig> with multiple ankyrin repeat domain proteins , suggesting a heterotrimeric organization of pp <dig>  <cit> . this makes the mammalian pp <dig> different from the yeast sit <dig> because the ankrd genes are not found in yeast and there is no evidence for sit <dig> heterotrimers. this opens the possibility that the ankrd subunits function to target and regulate pp <dig> actions in addition to the saps subunits. here we analyzed the properties of the pp6r <dig> subunit using partial proteolysis, deletions and co-precipitation assays from cells. the saps domain sequences were used to produce alternate structural models of helical repeat motifs, and these models were used to select sites for point mutations that were assayed by co-precipitation. the results indicate the saps domain subunits of pp <dig> use a newly-found variation of the helical repeat theme to achieve selective recognition of pp6c.

methods
antibodies, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
anti-flag antibodies were purchased from sigma-aldrich and used at a dilution of 1: <dig>  or 1: <dig> . goat anti-rabbit alexa fluor  <dig> and donkey anti-sheep alexa fluor  <dig> were purchased from molecular probes and invitrogen and used at a 1: <dig> dilution. goat anti-mouse irdye  <dig> and anti-chicken irdye  <dig> antibodies were purchased from rockland immunochemicals and used at a 1: <dig> dilution. rabbits were immunized with purified recombinant gst made in bacteria, and anti-gst antibodies were affinity-purified from serum and used at a 1: <dig> dilution. antibody against pp <dig>  <cit>  was used at a 1: <dig> dilution. sheep were immunized with purified recombinant gst-pp6r <dig> made in bacteria, and antibodies were affinity-purified from serum against mbp-pp6r <dig> and used at a 1: <dig> dilution. anti-pp6r <dig> beads were prepared as follows:  <dig> μl of protein-g agarose beads were incubated with  <dig> μg of affinity purified anti-pp6r <dig> in  <dig> ml at room temperature for  <dig> h. beads were then washed twice by centrifugation with  <dig> ml of  <dig>  m sodium borate solution, ph  <dig> . beads were resuspended in  <dig> ml of sodium borate and a final concentration of  <dig> mm disuccinimdyl pimelimate added. after incubation at room temperature for  <dig> min the coupling reaction was stopped by washing the beads once by centrifugation, with resuspension and incubation in  <dig>  m ethanolamine for  <dig> h at room temperature. beads were washed twice by centrifugation and resuspended in pbs. chicken anti-pp6r <dig> igy antibodies were prepared using gst-pp6r <dig> as immunogen by aves laboratories .

recombinant protein production and analyses
full length pp6r <dig>  was subcloned in pgex-4t- <dig> vector for production of recombinant gst-pp6r <dig> in bl- <dig> strain of e. coli that was purified using glutathione sepharose following manufacturer's instructions. pp6r <dig> saps domain  was subcloned by pcr and ligated into pet <dig> vector, expressed in bl <dig> cells, and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography using ni-nta agarose .

circular dichroic  spectrum of purified recombinant pp6r <dig> at  <dig>  mg/ml in tris hcl ph  <dig>  with  <dig>  m nacl was recorded with a aviv model  <dig> spectropolarimeter.

purified gst-pp6r <dig>  was incubated with  <dig> ng of tpck-trypsin in  <dig> mm tris ph  <dig>  at room temperature for times ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. reaction was stopped by transferring aliquots of the reaction into ice-cold denaturing buffer . samples were analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting. molecular size standards were biorad precision plus.

cell culture and transfections
hek <dig>  hek293t and hepg <dig> cells were grown in mem medium with  <dig> mm l-glutamine and 10% fbs. hela cells were grown in dmem medium containing 10% fbs. jurkat cells were grown in rpmi medium with  <dig> mm l-glutamine and 10% fbs. cells were grown at 37°c in humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere. hek <dig> cells at 40-50% confluence in  <dig> cm dishes were transiently transfected using 4- <dig> μg of plasmid dna mixed with arrest-in  for  <dig> min at room temperature before addition to cells. cells were harvested after  <dig> h and extracts prepared for immunoprecipitation.

sequence alignments and structure modelling
amino acid sequences of pp6r <dig> were not recognised as helical repeat motifs by standard algorithms . the pp6r <dig> amino acid sequence did not align with signature sequence motifs for either the arm or heat helical repeats. furthermore, the human pp6r <dig> sequence did not align with any other protein of known 3d structure, when using standard algorithms. we used the alscript program  <cit>  to align sequences as shown in figure four.

modelling of the saps protein was carried out using program rep  <cit> . rep was designed to identify structural repeats from protein sequences. the program has been trained on profiles from several known arm and heat repeat proteins, but did not identify repeat motifs in the pp6r <dig> sequence when used with standard thresholds. rep in a low-confidence, no-thresholds-applied mode detected sequence repeats in pp6r <dig>  but failed to assign them as arm, heat or ank repeats.

as an alternative we opted to use the 3d-jury protein structure prediction meta server . the metaserver first generates 3d models using diverse structure prediction methods, and then compares and scores models, based on their consistency  <cit> . this approach allowed us to generate possible models for the saps domain, based on other proteins that contain either arm or heat repeats. these models were depicted as structures in figure five using pymol .

chymotrypsin digestion of wild-type vs. mutated flag-pp6r3
human 293t cells at <40% confluence in  <dig> mm dishes were transfected using  <dig> μl arrest-in  diluted in  <dig> μl opti-mem with  <dig> μg of plasmid dna encoding either wild type pp6r <dig> or quadruple mutant pp6r <dig> . after  <dig> h, cells were lysed using 1% np- <dig> buffer and centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min. aliquots of  <dig> μl of the supernatant were incubated with  <dig> μl m <dig> agarose beads  overnight at 4°c with rocking. beads were washed 3× with  <dig> μl of wash buffer a , two times with  <dig> μl wash buffer b , and one time with  <dig> μl wash buffer c . the beads were resuspended in  <dig> μl wash buffer c and  <dig> μl removed as time zero control. chymotrypsin was added to a final concentration of  <dig>  ng/μl. at various times  <dig> μl aliquots were removed, mixed with  <dig> μl 2× sds buffer and heated to 100°c for  <dig> min.

samples were resolved by 4-15% gradient sds-page, transferred onto nitrocellulose by a semi-dry protocol, and the filter blocked with 5% non-fat milk in tris-buffered saline plus 1% tween  <dig>  the filters were probed with chicken anti-r <dig> antibodies  or anti-flag antibodies , developed with fluorescent secondary antibodies, and scanned 2d images were captured by an odyssey 2d infrared scanner . as a control a duplicate sample of washed beads resuspended in  <dig> μl wash buffer c was incubated at 100°c for  <dig> min. following centrifugation the supernatant with denatured gst-pp6r <dig> was incubated with chymotrypsin, and samples at various time points processed as described above. molecular size standards were biorad precision plus.

RESULTS
the saps domain appears in three human proteins, based on a common region of sequence identity and similarity . we prepared individual antibodies to each and found that pp6r <dig>  was most efficiently immunoprecipitated from hek <dig> cell extracts . pp6r <dig> co-precipitated endogenous pp <dig> catalytic subunit  that was detected by immunoblotting . immunoprecipitation was specific because neither pp6c nor pp6r <dig> was in control samples prepared using blank beads or non-immune primary antibody . after two rounds of immunoprecipitation the extracts were fully depleted of pp6r <dig>  as well as 50% of the endogenous pp6c. the other 50% of pp6c in the supernatant presumably was associated with other subunits besides pp6r <dig>  the same results were obtained with co-precipitation from extracts of hela, jurkat and hepg <dig> cells . we concluded that endogenous pp6r <dig> stably associates with about half of the total pp6c in tissue culture cell lines, making it the major partner for pp <dig> and a suitable candidate for further study as representative of the saps domain subunits.

trypsin digestion and cd spectrum of recombinant pp6r3
we expressed recombinant gst-pp6r <dig> fusion protein in bacteria, affinity-purified the protein and subjected it to partial proteolysis by trypsin to examine its fragmentation . the purified fusion protein migrated as a single band at  <dig> kda and, as expected, was reactive with both anti-gst and anti-pp6r <dig> antibodies. the actual molecular mass of pp6r <dig> is  <dig>  kda , so the fusion protein migrates much less  than predicted. another protein at ~ <dig> kda was detected by anti-gst immunoblotting, but not by anti-pp6r <dig> blotting, and this protein was not digested by trypsin under the conditions used, therefore we used it as a convenient loading control for aliquots taken at different time points. multiple trials were conducted to optimize conditions for time-dependent conversion of the gst-pp6r <dig> into fragments. digestion with trypsin at 1/ <dig>  at room temperature and ph  <dig>   gave progressive loss of the full length gst-pp6r <dig> fusion protein that was nearly complete by  <dig> min. treatment of gst with trypsin under identical conditions showed that gst was relatively resistant to digestion . therefore, we could use anti-gst immunoblotting to track cleavage of gst-pp6r <dig>  the full-length fusion protein was converted into four major fragments that were recognised by anti-gst  as well as with anti-pp6r <dig> . one fragment formed first, as early as  <dig> sec, and remained as the primary product after  <dig> min. all the major products were > <dig> kda, suggesting that trypsin cleaved following the gst fused to the n terminus at a point ca. 330- <dig> residues into the pp6r <dig> sequence. we concluded that the n-terminal region of pp6r <dig> up to that point has a conformation in solution that limits digestion by trypsin, even though there are many lysine and arginine residues in this region.

in addition, a recombinant his6-tagged pp6r <dig> protein, residues 1- <dig>  was purified from bacteria. the cd spectrum was recorded  and the purity of the protein verified by coomassie staining after sds-page . the cd spectrum with minima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm is characteristic of proteins that are predominantly made of alpha helices  <cit> . together these results suggest that the saps domain is composed of alpha helical secondary structures in a conformation that limits trypsin digestion.

mapping pp <dig> binding to saps domain in pp6r3
to map the region of pp6r <dig> required for pp6c binding we expressed the following in hek <dig> cells: 1) flag-tagged pp6r <dig> , 2) a saps region , 3) a c-terminal region  and 4) a truncated saps region  corresponding approximately to the trypsin-resistant n terminus. cell extracts and flag immunoprecipitates were prepared and immunoblotted for flag and endogenous pp6c . full length pp6r <dig> effectively co-precipitated pp6c , as did the saps region . less pp6c was recovered with 1- <dig> compared to full-length, but we attributed this to lower expression level of the 1- <dig> protein. the flag immunoprecipitate in lane  <dig> had about equal amounts of a protein corresponding to residues 1- <dig> and a smaller flag-tagged protein fragment. this smaller fragment is not expected to bind pp6c because of the lack of co-immunoprecipitation with the 1- <dig> protein of about the same size in the immunoblot . we noted that endogenous proteolysis generated nearly the same-sized fragments  in lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  pp6c did not co-precipitate at all with a c-terminal region of pp6r <dig>  . previous data with a different saps subunit, pp6r <dig>  showed residues 1- <dig> were sufficient for co-precipitation of pp6c, whereas residues 462- <dig> did not co-precipitate pp6c  <cit> . these new results show that in pp6r <dig> a region of residues 1- <dig> was not sufficient, but residues 1- <dig> could co-precipitate endogenous pp6c.

prediction of 3d organization of the saps domain
alternative models for the pp6r <dig> saps region were generated by sequence alignments  and structural modeling by the 3d-jury meta server, using proteins containing either arm or heat repeats. the modelling fits regions of sequence into putative alpha helices and predicts surface loops between the helices. the highest score models  were based on: 1) importin alpha arm repeat structures  , and 2) beta-catenin arm domain,  . models based on heat repeats in beta importin  and the pp2a pr <dig> subunit  had lower scores, but were included as possible alternatives in figure  <dig> . an unusual, new arm repeat structure of a vesicular transport factor called golgin p <dig> was published recently  <cit> . this structure offers another alternative for modelling of pp6r <dig>  in golgin p <dig>  helical repeats 7- <dig> contain extended loops between helix  <dig> and  <dig>  not previously seen in other arm domains. this novel structure raises the possibility that residues ~223- <dig> in pp6r <dig> form a single elongated repeat, ~ <dig> residues longer than standard .

the structure of a heat repeat is similar to the structure of an arm repeat, despite the fact that the arm motifs consist of three helices, while heat motifs have only two. in both cases, the repeats are stacked together to form a super-helix  that in the case of pp2a pr <dig> and importin are curved , while the structures of importin or beta-catenin are elongated, with less curvature . the helices in the model based on the golgin p <dig> structure are less uniform and their arrangement is less compact . there are predicted surface loops in the golgin p115-based structure that do not appear in the other models.

we expected that the saps predicted structure would resemble the heat helical repeats in the pp2a pr <dig> subunit, because, after all, this protein fold binds the pp2a catalytic subunit that is nearly identical to pp <dig>  however, this model had the lowest 3d-jury score. the models in both figures  <dig> and  <dig> agree in assignment of the boundaries of the helical motifs in the n terminal residues 1- <dig>  and therefore we were confident in the phasing of these intra-repeat loops. the assignments of helices and loops past residue  <dig> was more difficult and the models diverged in these segments. we speculated that the interactions between pp6r <dig> and the pp <dig> catalytic subunit could be mediated by the intra-motif loops and not the inter-motif loops. we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate charge reversal mutations in acidic residues that were predicted from the modelling to be in the loops. this was to test whether these sites were required for binding pp6c and therefore allow us to discriminate between the models in figure  <dig> 

mutation analysis of the pp6r <dig> binding to pp6
we used transient expression of flag-pp6r <dig> and co-precipitation to assay binding to endogenous pp6c in cells . wild type flag-pp6r <dig> and the following mutants 1) e <dig> k; 2) d113k; 3) e <dig> k and 4) e <dig> k were expressed in hek <dig> cells, and the amount of flag protein and co-precipitated pp6c determined by immunoblotting. the recovery of the flag-tagged pp6r <dig> proteins was nearly identical  and the intensity of anti-flag staining was used to normalize the anti-pp6c staining, with the amount of pp6c bound to wild type pp6r <dig>  set as  <dig> . multiple independent experiments gave results that were analyzed together. dual mutation of e <dig> and e <dig> to k increased recovery of pp6c by about 30%. in contrast, other negative to positive charge mutations reduced binding of pp6c. the decrease in pp6c binding due to the d113r mutation was not significant. dual mutations of either e204-e <dig> or e259-e <dig> produced statistically significant  <dig> to 35% reduction in pp6c binding. combination of the dual mutations of 204/ <dig> plus 259/ <dig> resulted in the largest effect compared to wild type, an overall 80% reduction in co-precipitation of endogenous pp6c. these data indicated that the negatively charged residues in the predicted loops at residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in pp6r <dig> were likely involved in association with pp6c.

mutations reduce pp6c binding without change in cleavage by chymotrypsin
mutations that result in a loss-of-function always leave open the possibility that alteration of overall protein conformation causes the loss of function, rather than a local change of a particular side chain. this is even true for charged resides that are likely to appear on the protein surface. to compare the conformation of wild type and quadruple mutated  pp6r <dig> we utilized partial proteolysis by chymotrypsin . this protease cleaves c terminal to aromatic residues and therefore mutation of charged residues should not affect its reaction. indeed, we observed essentially identical patterns of chymotrypsin digestion for wild type and the quadruple mutant flag-pp6r <dig>  both the kinetics of the reaction over the first  <dig> min and the sizes of fragments formed were indistinguishable. the fragments were reactive with both anti-flag  and anti-pp6r <dig> antibodies , indicating that the primary sites of proteolysis were toward the c terminal region of the protein. we noted that the n terminal region  of pp6r <dig> was relatively less susceptible to chymotrypsin, because a flag-tagged fragment of this size persisted longer than other fragments formed within the first min of digestion . these patterns of fragmentation reflected conformational constraints on proteolysis because denaturation of the flag-pp6r <dig> resulted in its complete degradation in less than one min in a parallel reaction . we concluded that the mutation of the negative to positive charges in the predicted loops that severely reduced binding of pp6c did not cause a major change in conformation of pp6r <dig> 

discussion
this study examined the properties of pp6r <dig>  as an example of the conserved family of saps domain subunits that are specific for binding to pp <dig> phosphatase. the pp6r <dig> co-precipitated half the endogenous pp6c in different cell lines, showing it was the major binding partner for pp <dig>  compared to the other saps subunits, and other proteins known to bind pp6c, such as alpha <dig>  <cit>  and tip  <cit> , a.k.a. tab <dig>  <cit> . expression of the human saps subunits in yeast allowed for the co-precipitation of endogenous sit <dig> with each of the saps. however, only pp6r <dig> fully rescued strains deleted for all yeast saps with restoration of budding, indicative of cell cycle progression  <cit> . we conclude that pp6r <dig> is a dominant and functionally conserved cellular partner for pp6c, making it a suitable representative of the family of saps proteins.

our hypothesis is that the saps region of pp6r <dig> recognizes pp6c using alpha helical repeats that present residues in the inter-helical loops for subunit-subunit interaction. this follows in part from what is known about the pp2a complex with its scaffold a or pr <dig> subunit  <cit> , but diverges in specific details. the n terminal  <dig> residues of pp6r <dig> are sufficient for stable association with pp6c, showing truncation of the c terminal 350+ residues of pp6r <dig> does not eliminate, or even diminish binding of pp6c. the 1- <dig> fragment of pp6r <dig> supports co-precipitation of pp6c, but a 1- <dig> fragment is not sufficient, suggesting that residues between  <dig> and  <dig> are critical, either for direct contact with the catalytic subunit, or for maintenance of the conformation of the saps domain. the inability of the 1- <dig> fragment to co-precipitate pp6c does not imply that it is not required or involved, just that it alone is insufficient. clearly, point mutations within the 1- <dig> region  were effective at nearly eliminating pp6c binding to full length pp6r <dig>  this at least implies that these residues are somehow required and even dominant, though not alone sufficient, for stable subunit-subunit association. we speculate that there are contacts between pp6c and two regions of the saps domain, involving residues in the 200- <dig> region as well as residues in the 355- <dig> region. multiple points of contact may well be necessary to achieve the specificity for pp <dig> vs. pp2a. determination of the co-crystal structure will be needed to visualize the spatial organization of the saps domain and interactions with pp6c.

as a preliminary step in understanding the saps domain organization, and as a guide for mutagenesis we used sequence alignments and jury modelling methods to produce models of the saps region of pp6r <dig>  the sequences of saps domains are sufficiently conserved so as to allow discovery of orthologs in species from yeast to mammals  <cit> , and have been assigned a pfam  designation, however the sequences do not allow a match to any structure based on available algorithms. the saps domain is predicted to have regions of alpha helical secondary structure, and the cd spectrum of an isolated saps domain indicates predominantly alpha-helical organization. we turned to jury modelling methods to produce hypothetical structures for the saps domain, using other known helical repeat proteins such as importins, beta-catenin, pp2a scaffolding pr <dig> subunit and golgin p <dig>  these models resemble one another in that they are made of multiple helices, but each has different helix segments, inter-helix loops, and positioning of the helices relative to one another. because previous studies of pp2a binding to its helical scaffolding  or regulatory subunit alpha <dig> showed basic residues on the phosphatase catalytic subunit were required, and these presumably paired with acidic side chains in other subunit  <cit> , we focused on acidic residues in pp6r <dig> as likely sites for contacts with pp6c. reduced pp <dig> binding due to charge reversal mutations was taken as evidence for involvement of specific residues in subunit-subunit association. this analysis implicated e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> as possible participants. helical repeat models for saps domain based on beta-catenin , or on golgin p <dig>  position residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proximal to one another, on the same side of the protein surface, in contrast to the 3d model based on pr <dig> a subunit  that positions these loops on opposite sides. therefore, results of our mutagenesis studies suggest either model b or c in figure  <dig> for arrangement of the alpha helices in the saps domain.

the sensitivity of pp6r <dig> to proteolytic cleavage about 330- <dig> residues from the n terminus was noted with trypsin digestion of purified recombinant gst fusion protein, and with endogenous protease cleavage of various sized flag-tagged proteins expressed in intact cells, and with chymotrypsin digestion of flag-tagged pp6r <dig> immunoprecipitated from cells. in the 3d model based on the golgin p <dig> structure  residues 320- <dig> are not in a helix, but instead predicted to be in an exposed surface loop , whereas in the beta-catenin structural model  this segment is mostly in a helical conformation. there are two tandem pro-pro sequences at 323- <dig> and 338- <dig> likely to prevent alpha helix formation and the intervening sequence contains kks and twg as possible sites for trypsin and chymotrypsin. this putative surface loop and the juxtaposition of the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> residues makes the golgin p <dig> structure, compose of arm repeats, our favored model for the saps domain in pp6r <dig>  we speculate that some structural element in the 350- <dig> sequence region, following this loop in the golgin p <dig> structure, constitutes a required contact site for binding to pp6c. the low sequence similarity between the golgin p <dig> and other arm repeat proteins, despite arm structures that are remarkably similar, tells us that the sampling of arm, heat, ank and pum repeat proteins in the pdb database is still limited. this may account for why the saps domain sequence did not match any known structures.

finally, binding of the pp <dig> catalytic subunit to the saps region of pp6r <dig> leaves the c terminal region of pp6r <dig> for interaction with the third subunit of the pp <dig> trimer, one of the ankyrin-repeat subunits , proteins known previously as ankrd <dig>  ankrd <dig> and ankrd <dig>  this hypothetical arrangement is similar to, but different from, the actual 3d structures determined for pp2a heterotrimers by x-ray crystallography. most obvious, the entire a subunit for pp2a is heat repeats, while no predictions suggest the same is true for pp <dig> subunits, where the saps domain only includes the n terminal half of the protein. the pr <dig> or a subunit scaffold for pp2a is an open arc of side-by-side helices in the ac dimer, but bends into a more closed horseshoe or letter "c" shape in the abc trimer structures . the b regulatory subunits or proteins such as small t antigen evidently induce the conformational change in the scaffold subunit  <cit> . other evidence prior to the determination of the crystal structure indicated that small t antigen affected the conformation of the pp2a scaffold subunit  <cit> . the protease sensitivity of pp6r <dig> at ~ <dig> residues from n terminus suggests that there may be a flexible or disordered and exposed junction. in pp <dig> trimers the subunit made of ankyrin repeats is expected to contact pp6c to alter substrate specificity while primarily tethered to the c terminal region of pp6r <dig>  which alone is sufficient for stable association. the structures of known ankyrin-repeat proteins such as ankyrin, iκb, and mypt <dig> show that neighboring helical repeats produce curvature in the overall structure  <cit> . thus, we imagine that the pp <dig> catalytic and ars subunits could come into proximity to one another by their mutual binding to pp6r <dig>  such a model, like what is seen with pp2a, would predict that substrate specificity and possible regulation of activity arises from interaction of the catalytic and regulatory subunits  brought together by tethering to a common scaffold .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the conserved saps domain in pp6r <dig> forms helical repeats that are probably organized similar to those in golgin p <dig>  a core structure of about  <dig> n terminal residues is relatively protease-resistant and linked by a readily cleaved exposed segment to the rest of the saps region that is required for stable association with catalytic subunit. charged residues in interhelical loops are used as primary contacts for specific recognition of pp <dig> and sit <dig> catalytic subunits relative to other type-2a phosphatases.
