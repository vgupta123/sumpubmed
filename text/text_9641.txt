BACKGROUND
the pregnane × receptor  is a key xenobiotic receptor that regulates the metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics and endobiotics by regulating the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters  <cit> . expression of pxr target gene is regulated by binding of pxr to its promoter region, such as that of cytochrome p <dig> 3a <dig> , a key enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of more than 50% of all clinically prescribed drugs  <cit> . changes in the expression of cyp3a <dig> affect drug metabolism and alter the therapeutic and toxicologic responses to drugs, which may in turn lead to adverse drug interactions.

the activity of pxr is regulated not only by direct ligand binding  <cit>  but also by various cell signaling pathways  <cit> , such as those mediated by protein kinase c   <cit> , protein kinase a   <cit> , cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>   <cit> , 70kda form of ribosomal protein s <dig> kinase   <cit> , forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma   <cit> , and nuclear factor κb   <cit> .

flavonoids - secondary metabolites found ubiquitously in plants - are the most common group of polyphenolic compounds consumed by humans as dietary constituents  <cit> . thousands of naturally occurring flavonoids, such as flavones and isoflavones, have been characterized  <cit> . flavonoids have been reported to have anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer activities  <cit> . the widespread use of flavonoids, coupled with their potentially beneficial effects, has triggered studies on the mechanism by which they modulate signaling pathways.

natural flavonoids have been shown to inhibit cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  <cit> , and cdk <dig>  <cit> . most cdks, including cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  are involved in cell cycle regulation and require the binding of cyclins for their activation. however, the activation of cdk <dig> requires one of the two non-cyclin regulatory subunits p <dig> or p <dig>  which have 57% amino acid homology. p <dig> can be converted in a ca2+-dependent manner to p <dig>  a highly active and stable proteolytic product  <cit> . the protease calpain catalyzes the cleavage of p <dig>  and this reaction can be effectively inhibited by specific inhibitors of calpain such as calpeptin  <cit> . cdk <dig> is not involved in cell cycle progression, and is expressed in all tissues, but its levels of expression and activity are highest in the nervous system  <cit> . the expressions of p <dig> and p <dig> are also highest in the nervous system. although cdk <dig> has been mainly implicated in early development of the central nervous system  and maintenance of neuronal architecture  <cit> , the expression and regulatory activity of cdk5/p <dig> have also been reported in several non-cns tissues such as lens epithelia  <cit> , muscle tissues  <cit> , hepatoma cells  <cit> , adipose tissues  <cit> , and male reproductive system  <cit> .

the widespread use of flavonoids has triggered studies to investigate their effects on drug metabolism and herbal-drug interactions. recently, flavonoids have been shown to induce cyp expression through pxr  <cit> , but the mechanism of flavonoids-mediated pxr activation and cyp induction remain unknown.

because the function of pxr can be modulated by cellular signaling pathways, we used a cell-based screening approach in this study to identify compounds with known bioactivities that activate pxr-mediated gene expression. by screening a library of known bioactive compounds, we identified a series of flavonoids that are pxr activators. since these flavonoids did not directly bind to pxr, and flavonoids might inhibit cdk <dig>  we studied the effect of flavonoids on the activity of cdk5/p <dig> and the regulation of pxr by cdk <dig> in order to determine the possible role of flavonoids in regulating pxr-mediated gene expression of cyp3a <dig> 

RESULTS
flavonoids activate pxr-mediated cyp3a <dig> gene expression
by screening a library of  <dig> compounds with known bioactivity in the human carcinoma cell line hepg <dig> stably transfected with pxr and cyp3a4-luc, which was previously used to detect the activation pxr  <cit> , we identified a series of flavonoids as potent activators of pxr-mediated cyp3a <dig> promoter activation . these flavonoids included flavones luteolin, apigenin , and chrysin  and isoflavones daidzein, biochanin a, prunetin, and genistein . rifampicin, a human pxr agonist, was used as a control in this assay, and had an ec <dig> of  <dig>  μm. compared with the activation of pxr by rifampicin at  <dig> μm , some flavonoids were more potent at activating pxr at high concentrations. for example, luteolin at  <dig> μm was  <dig> times more effective than  <dig> μm rifampicin in activating pxr. under the same assay conditions and compound treatment time  as the pxr transactivation assay described above, no significant cytotoxicity was detected for all flavonoids tested .

to determine whether the flavonoids activate pxr by directly binding to it, we tested  <dig> flavonoids  in a pxr-binding assay. although the potent pxr agonist sr- <dig> bound strongly  to pxr, chrysin did not bind to pxr at all concentrations tested . luteolin and apigenin did not bind to pxr at or below  <dig> μm. however, below  <dig> μm, they strongly activated pxr  . these data suggest that mechanisms other than direct pxr binding might be responsible for chrysin-, luteolin-and apigenin-mediated pxr activation.

activation of cdk5/p <dig> attenuates pxr-mediated gene expression
flavonoids have been shown to inhibit protein kinases, including cdks  <cit> . flavonoids may regulate pxr by inhibiting cdk <dig>  as cdk <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate pxr  <cit> . however, because flavonoids can inhibit cdk <dig>  <cit>  and cdk5/p <dig> signaling  is active in hepatoma  <cit> , we tested whether inhibition of cdk <dig> by flavonoids is responsible for the flavonoids-mediated activation of pxr.

since the activity of cdk <dig> requires p <dig> as a critical regulatory subunit, we determined whether p <dig> is expressed in hepg <dig> cells, in which flavonoid-mediated activation of pxr was first discovered. we found that p <dig> was expressed in hepg <dig> cells at levels comparable to those in imr- <dig> , a neuronal cell line that expresses p <dig> and has been used as a positive control for p <dig> expression  <cit> .

next, we determined the functional correlation between the activities of cdk <dig> and pxr. overexpression of cdk <dig> led to attenuation of both basal  and rifampicin-induced activation of pxr . expression levels of pxr were not affected by overexpression of cdk <dig> , confirming that the attenuation of pxr activity is because of the inhibitory effect of cdk <dig> on pxr and not because of a decrease in expression level of pxr. the inhibitory effect of cdk <dig> on pxr was further confirmed by the increase in pxr activity on sirna-mediated downregulation of cdk <dig> . reduced expression of cdk <dig> in response to sirna treatment was verified . in addition, we showed that flavonoids significantly decreased the inhibitory effect of cdk <dig> on cyp3a <dig> promoter activity induced by rifampicin . in the absence of flavonoids, cdk <dig> inhibited cyp3a <dig> promoter activity by 40%. the inhibitory effect of cdk <dig> was decreased to 4% and 23% by  <dig> μm of biochanin a and  <dig> μm of chrysin, respectively . these results suggest that flavonoids may inhibit cdk <dig> and restore the cdk5-mediated downregulation of cyp3a <dig> promoter activity.

to further validate the role of cdk <dig> in regulating pxr function, we examined the effect of calpeptin on pxr function. calpeptin has been shown to block the conversion of p <dig> to the highly active p <dig>  thereby reducing the activity of cdk <dig>  <cit> . therefore we anticipated that the calpeptin-mediated inhibition of cdk <dig> would lead to activation of pxr, and calpeptin may restore the cdk5-mediated downregulation of cyp3a <dig> promoter activity. indeed, we found that calpeptin induced pxr activity  , and significantly  decreased the inhibitory effect of cdk <dig> on the activity of cyp3a <dig> promoter . taken together, these data indicate that cdk <dig> negatively regulates pxr activity, and that inhibition of cdk <dig> is at least partially responsible for flavonoids-induced activation of pxr.

cdk <dig> phosphorylates pxr
one possible mechanism by which cdk <dig> regulates pxr is by directly phosphorylating pxr. all cdks recognize the same motif for phosphorylation, and cdk <dig>  <cit>  and cdk <dig>  <cit>  have been shown to phosphorylate pxr. as expected, in an in vitro kinase assay, reconstituted complexes of purified cdk5/p <dig> directly phosphorylated pxr , suggesting that cdk <dig> can directly phosphorylate hpxr.

inhibition of multiple cdks might contribute to flavonoids-mediated activation of pxr
since flavonoids have been reported to inhibit multiple cdks, we investigated the inhibitory effect of flavonoid apigenin on various cdks. apigenin inhibited multiple cdks, including cdk <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . since cdk <dig> has been previously shown to negatively regulate pxr function  <cit> , these data suggest that inhibition of multiple cdks might contribute to the activating effect of flavonoids on pxr.

discussion
the widespread use of flavonoids has triggered several studies to investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of these naturally occurring compounds. flavonoids have been reported to inhibit protein kinases such as cdks  <cit>  and induce the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cyps  <cit> . the stimulatory effect of flavonoids on cyp expression might have significant implication on the pharmacokinetics of drugs co-administered with herbal remedy and potential herbal-drug interactions.

in a cell-based screening approach designed to identify activators of pxr, we identified that flavones luteolin, apigenin and chrysin and isoflavones daidzein, biochanin a, prunetin, and genistein are activators of pxr-mediated cyp3a <dig> gene expression. genistein and daidzein have been previously reported to activate pxr  <cit> . in our study, the lack of potent binding of chrysin, luteolin and apigenin to pxr suggests that mechanisms other than direct pxr binding might be responsible for pxr activation by these flavonoids, and the reported inhibitory effect of flavonoids on cdks  led us to investigate the functional relationship between inhibition of cdk <dig> and activation of pxr.

we first showed that p <dig>  a critical regulatory protein for cdk <dig>  is expressed in the human liver carcinoma cell line hepg <dig>  we found an inverse correlation between cdk <dig> activity and pxr activity: downregulation of cdk/p <dig> signaling activated whereas its upregulation inhibited pxr. in addition, flavonoids restored the cdk5-mediated downregulation of cyp3a <dig> promoter activity. we further showed that cdk5/p <dig> directly phosphorylated pxr.

cdk <dig>  unlike its regulatory subunit p <dig>  is ubiquitously expressed. the expression of p <dig> is highest in the nervous system, and has been reported in many non-cns cells and tissues such as lens epithelia  <cit> , muscle tissues  <cit>  hepatoma cells  <cit> , adipose tissues  <cit>  and male reproductive system  <cit> . our discovery that p <dig> is expressed in hepg <dig> human liver carcinoma cells expands the list of cells and tissues that are found to express p <dig>  p <dig> can be cleaved to generate the highly active p <dig> and we show that calpeptin, a peptide previously reported to inhibit the cleavage of p <dig>  <cit> , highly induced pxr activity and blocked the inhibitory effect of cdk <dig> on pxr, supporting that cdk <dig> negatively regulates pxr activity.

as with other cdk inhibitors, the inhibitory effect of flavonoids is not specific to cdk <dig>  as suggested by inhibition of multiple cdks by apigenin in the cdk kinase profiling assay. cdk <dig> has been previously shown to negatively regulate pxr function  <cit> . our data suggest that flavonoid-mediated activation of pxr is not because of the inhibition of cdk <dig> only; inhibition of multiple cdks, including cdk <dig>  might contribute to this activation.

gene expression of cyp3a <dig> is regulated not only by pxr but also by other signaling pathways including other nuclear receptors. these signaling pathways might also cross-talk with each other. therefore, it is important to investigate the regulation of other signaling pathways and nuclear receptors by flavonoids and the implications in the regulation of gene expression of cyp3a <dig> and other cyps. it is also possible that metabolites of flavonoids may play roles in this complex regulation network. comprehensively investigating the signaling network regulated by flavonoids and their metabolites will contribute to understanding the roles of flavonoids in potential herbal-drug interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is the first report that correlates the effect of flavonoids on regulation of expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes to their inhibitory effect on cdks, which in turn negatively regulates pxr function. because of the widespread use of flavonoids by humans as dietary constituents, our discovery may have important implications on the pharmacokinetics of drugs co-administered with herbal remedy and herbal-drug interactions.
