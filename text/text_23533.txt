BACKGROUND
muscle is the major energy consuming and storage organ. an imbalance of nutrients, energy, and oxygen supply-and-demand in muscle cells is evident following cardiac muscle or skeletal muscle attack, injury, or damage. the consequences of these imbalances depend on muscle structure and metabolism and, thus, the muscle’s entire complement of proteins and their expression patterns. similar changes, i.e., termination of nutrient and energy supplies and anoxia, also occur in muscle cells post mortem. indeed, these changes underlie the conversion of muscle to meat in food production. the physiological processes accompanying the change of muscle to meat involve expression of many genes associated with muscle structure and metabolic features  <cit> . genes active in the muscle could therefore potentially have pathogenetic effects by disturbing muscle energy and oxygen homeostasis in vivo, as well as conferring traits related to meat quality post mortem.

meat quality is complex and is affected by genetic and environmental factors as well as slaughtering procedures  <cit> . the conversion of muscle to meat is important not only as an economic factor in pork production, but also because these events mimic pathological processes associated with muscle injury or damage in humans. post mortem traits for meat quality and carcass are influenced by a complex network of gene interactions in muscle; therefore, elucidating the relationships between genes and how these genes, in turn, influence meat quality and carcass traits is critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of the muscle to meat conversion as well as muscle pathologic processes including muscle atrophy, dystrophy, and hypoxia. additionally, pigs share many genomic and physiological similarities with humans and, therefore, provide a good model to study the genetic determination of complex traits and as a biomedical model  <cit> .

recent advances in functional genomic screening, which can help determine molecular processes underlying phenotypic differences  <cit> , have identified roles for micrornas  in regulation of myogenesis  <cit>  and adipogenesis  <cit> . mirnas are small, non-coding rna molecules of approximately  <dig> nucleotides. the primary mirna transcript has a stem-loop structure that is recognized and cleaved via rna processing enzymes to produce a double-stranded duplex. mirnas target mrna transcripts via base-pair complementarity, typically in the 3′ untranslated region  <cit> , but also in the coding sequence  <cit> . this targeting can induce transcript cleavage, degradation, destabilization, or repression of translation, thereby modulating protein levels. it has been recently shown that reduction of transcript level account for most of the regulatory, repressive effects of mirnas  <cit> . target genes that are regulated by mirnas through degradation of their respective transcripts consequently show negative correlation of their mrna with the mirna regulator. moreover, one mirna can target several — even hundreds of — genes. therefore, a unique approach for identifying mirna-mrna regulatory modules was recently introduced, whereby paired mirna-mrna expression profiles were constructed to predict putative target genes of mirnas  <cit> .

many studies used the network analysis for dissecting the complex traits  <cit> . weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  has been successfully applied in a variety of different settings  <cit> . wgcna groups genes into modules based on their co-expression across a set of samples and finally relates these modules to the traits of interest in order to elucidate relevant modules or genes.

in order to identify groups of co-expressed genes  and on the hierarchically superior level of mirnas that are correlated with organismal traits related to carcass and meat quality, we first applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis  and subsequently we adapted the paired expression profile approach. we identified co-expression networks regulated by mirna after filtering of negatively-correlated mirna-mrna pairs and predicting target genes. the integration of mirna and mrna expression analyses as well as network analysis enabled us to interpret the differentially-regulated genes from a systems perspective, yielding new insight into several biological pathways underlying phenotypic differences.

RESULTS
meat quality and carcass traits phenotypes
elucidating the relationships between genes and how these genes, in turn, influence muscle metabolic and structural properties is critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of the muscle to meat process as well as muscle pathologic and regenerative processes related to muscle atrophy, dystrophy and hypoxia. in total,  <dig> performance-tested crossbred pig  samples were used to investigate meat quality and carcass traits. descriptions of  <dig> carcass traits and  <dig> meat quality traits, as well as means and standard deviations, analysed in this study are shown in table  <dig>  high correlation coefficients were found between the same biochemical and biophysical parameters measured at different positions and at different time points post mortem, like fatness traits or ph. the other cluster covers the traits drip loss, protein content, and conductivity. this cluster was negatively correlated to ph or fatness .

gene co-expression network construction for mrna
to investigate the role of transcriptional networks in muscle, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis  using expression data from m. longissimus dorsi necropsies of the  <dig> performance-tested crossbred pigs . expression analysis using genechip porcine genome arrays  containing  <dig>  probe sets identified  <dig>  probe sets with consistent expression according to mas <dig> analysis; these were used for further analysis. using wgcna, residuals derived from the mixed-model analysis of expression levels of  <dig>  probe sets were used for constructing the muscle transcriptional network. wgcna grouped genes into  <dig> modules based on patterns of co-expression. each module was labelled with a unique color identifier and was characterized for enrichment of genes of specific gene ontology  categories . to represent the gene expression profiles of the highly correlated genes inside a given module, we used the first principal component, which is referred to as the module eigengene . we tested each me for correlation with meat and carcass traits.

module-trait associations of mrna
sets of genes  with common expression patterns that were associated with particular traits were identified based on the correlation between me and organismal phenotype. we identified five modules that significantly associated with meat quality. modules dark-turquoise and orange were correlated positively to ph traits and negatively to drip loss  . module dark-turquoise  was highly enriched for genes belonging to the cluster “glucose metabolic process”  and the kegg-pathway “insulin signaling” with an enrichment score  of  <dig> . module orange  was enriched for transcripts of the functional annotation clusters “response to wounding”, “defense response” and “inflammatory response” . modules red, black, and tan were correlated negatively to ph traits and positively to drip loss  . further, modules red , black , and tan  were enriched for genes of the top functional annotation clusters of “mitochondrial ribosome”, “mitochondrion”, and “extracellular matrix” with es of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. only one module  showed association with traits related to fatness .

co-expression networks and module-trait associations for mirna
transcriptional networks of muscle micrornas were studied with a wgcna using mirna expression data on m. longissimus dorsi from the same animals as above. residuals, derived from the analysis of expression levels after correction for systematic effects according to the mixed model, were used for constructing the muscle mirna transcriptional networks, i.e., modules. nine modules were identified . only  <dig> modules were associated with meat quality at a significance level of p <  <dig> . module purple was correlated positively to lf24mld at p =  <dig>  and negatively to ph24mld and imp24mld at p =  <dig>  and p =  <dig> , respectively. module purple consisted of  <dig> mirna families . module blue was positively correlated to ph45mld and imp24mld at p =  <dig>  and p =  <dig> , respectively. module blue comprised  <dig> mirna families .

individual mirna expression profiles and correlated traits
in addition to mirna modules, the expression of  <dig> individual mirnas probe sets, which corresponded to  <dig> unique sequences belonging to  <dig> mirna families, were profiled and examined for correlation with meat and carcass traits. in total,  <dig> mirna-phenotype pairs revealed correlations at p <  <dig> . table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> mirnas with highly significant correlations to phenotypes .

endogenous correlation of expression profiles between mirna and mrna
we performed pairwise correlation coefficient analysis to evaluate association of expression levels between  <dig> mirna probe sets and  <dig>  mrna probe sets. among the  <dig> , <dig> pearson correlation coefficients, we detected significant correlation in  <dig>  mirna-mrna pairs at p-values ≤  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . the  <dig>  pairs comprised  <dig> mirna probe sets belonging to  <dig> mirna families that were correlated with  <dig>  mrna probe sets. of these  <dig>  pairs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  pairs showed positive and negative correlations, respectively. positive correlations tended to be more dramatic than negative correlations; the correlation between mir- <dig> and vtn was the most significant . the most significant negative correlation was between mir- <dig> and loc <dig> . the most frequently involved mirna family was mirna- <dig>  which was correlated with  <dig> mrnas. in total  <dig> mirna families showed significantly negative correlations with groups of up to  <dig> genes. we evaluated go classification for each mirna-correlated gene set of more than  <dig> genes . the most striking findings were from gene sets that were negatively correlated with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir- <dig>  for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> the set of negatively correlated genes was highly enriched for genes belonging to the clusters “translation”  and “translational elongation” . the set of genes negatively correlated with mir- <dig> was enriched for “cytoskeletal protein binding” . the set of genes negatively correlated with mir- <dig> was enriched for “threonine-type peptidase activity” , while mir132-correlated genes were enriched for “proteasome complex” .

integration of negative correlation of mirna and mrna with module-trait association and target prediction
a total of  <dig>  pairs of mirnas and mrnas that showed negative correlations at p-values ≤  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  belonged to  <dig>  mrna probe sets  and  <dig> mirna probe sets . of these,  <dig> pairs were assigned to modules dark-turquoise, red, black, and tan, which showed correlation with traits related to meat quality . however, no genes in module orange were negatively correlated with mirna at fdr <  <dig> . only one gene  in the module dark-turquoise was negatively correlated with mir- <dig> . in module black,  <dig> genes were negatively correlated with  <dig> mirna families, totaling  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> pairs of mirnas and mrnas were identified in modules red  and tan . known genes belonging to modules dark-turquoise, red, black, and tan and their negatively-correlated mirnas are shown in table  <dig>  out of  <dig>  pairs of mirnas and mrnas that showed negative correlations at p-values ≤  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ,  <dig> pairs were assigned to modules blue and purple, which correlated with meat quality . these  <dig> pairs of mirnas and mrnas belonged to  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> genes .

further, targetscan and rnahybrid were used to scan mirna and mrna sequences , to obtain additional evidence for their functional link; these sequences corresponded to  <dig>  pairs of negatively-correlated mirnas and mrnas. in total,  <dig> pairs of mirna and mrna were confirmed by either of the two in silico prediction methods:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs were predicted by rnahybrid, targetscan, or both methods, respectively. the  <dig> mirna-mrna pairs covered  <dig> probe sets of mirnas  and  <dig> targets probe sets . when focusing on genes of the trait-correlated modules dark-turquoise, orange, red, black, and tan,  <dig> out  <dig> pairs of mirnas and mrnas were confirmed with at least one in silico method. these  <dig> pairs comprised  <dig> mirna families and  <dig> genes .

discussion
here, we present an integrative approach to identify transcriptomic differences that may contribute to variation of the kinetics of metabolic processes under diminished oxygen and nutrition supply that is evident during muscle conversion to meat. the speed and extend of the switch from aerobic to anaerobic atp production, until final total failure of energy production, and of protein degradation processes largely affect meat quality  <cit> . in order to identify functional networks of genes contributing to these processes an approach was used based on a multi-level integration of weighted gene co-expression network analysis  of mrna and mirna with mrna-mirna pair correlation and mirna target prediction.

mrna abundance and co-expression networks linked to muscle and meat properties
we used transcriptional network analysis to identify co-expression modules  that correlated to meat quality phenotype. these modules were highly enriched for genes involved in “extracellular matrix”, “glucose metabolic process”, and “mitochondrion” ; i.e. processes affecting structural and metabolic properties.

a dominant role of mitochondria is the production of atp by oxidative phosphorylation that depends on oxygen supply. when oxygen is limited  the glucose metabolism occurs by anaerobic respiration, a process that is independent of the mitochondria. a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism - favouring the production of lactic acid - results in a ph decline post mortem and thereby influence the meat quality  <cit> . so the biological process of mitochondria as well as the way of glucose metabolism play a significant role in the muscle cell and finally impact on meat quality. indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in decreased cellular energy production is also responsible for a variety of human myopathies and cardiomyopathies  <cit> .

genes assigned to the go category of “extracellular matrix” encode proteins belonging to the myofibrillar scaffold. the characteristics of the myofibrillar scaffold and the kinetics of their fragmentation were associated with tenderness and water-holding capacity of meat. in particular, the proteolysis of muscle proteins affects the shrinkage of myofibrils, the development of pores in the cell membranes, so called drip channels, and the non-covalent binding of water molecules  <cit> . collagens are major constituents of the extracellular matrix . in our study there were many collagen genes that are reported to be correlated with various muscle disorders  <cit> . for example, collagen type vi , an important component of skeletal muscle ecm, is involved in maintaining tissue integrity  <cit> . col6a1-/- mice show a complete absence of collagen vi chains and display a myopathic phenotype, abnormal mitochondria, and increased apoptosis of muscle fibres  <cit> .

mirna abundance and co-expression networks linked to muscle and meat properties
our finding of the relevance of mitochondrial metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, and muscle structural protein composition to post mortem processes affecting meat quality is in line with our previous results obtained in other populations  <cit> . additionally, while the previous studies focused on trait-associated mrna expression, here another hierarchical level in the regulatory network relevant to processes occurring under conditions of insufficient oxygen, energy, and nutrient supplies is provided. in fact, mirna was integrated into this study as a regulator molecule of muscle transcripts. mirnas with identical seed sequences   <cit>  or that are closely located on the same chromosome   <cit>  have similar expression trends. this was confirmed in our study, where most of the modules consisted of the same families of mirnas or mirnas located on the same chromosome. in this study, marginal association of mirna co-expression modules to organismal traits was found compared to mrna co-expression modules. on the one hand, co-expressed mirnas of the same family or cluster might not regulate the same trait. on the other hand, this may be caused by indirect regulation of organismal traits by mirnas via their effect on mrna transcripts. accordingly, individual mirna correlation to phenotypes was also considered. recent studies have revealed key roles for mirnas in the regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation, and changes in mirna expression are associated with various skeletal muscle disorders  <cit> . in this study, several mirnas were correlated with carcass and meat quality traits. this includes mir- <dig>  previously identified in studies of myotube maturation and in the maintenance of the myofibrillar organization  <cit>  and found to contribute to muscle pathogenetic mechanisms  <cit> . interestingly, mir- <dig>  which showed highest correlation with ph24mld and ph24msm, has been widely studied for roles in the regulation of skeletal muscle development, including in proliferation and myogenesis  <cit>  as well as muscle disorders  <cit> . recently, a study reported that mice with genetic deletions of mir-133a- <dig> and mir-133a- <dig> developed adult-onset centronuclear myopathy in type ii  myofibres, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function, fast-to-slow myofibre conversion, and disarray of muscle triads  <cit> . these are changes of muscle structure and metabolism that also impact meat quality. in addition to its well established role in translation , mir-23a was also recently identified as a key regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation and is predicted to target multiple adult fast myosin heavy chain  genes, including myh <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> <cit> . for fat traits, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were highly correlated . this is consistent with previous reports of mir- <dig> being involved in adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and adipocyte differentiation  <cit>  and of mir-103/ <dig> being involved in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity  <cit> .

in this study we showed for the first time more complex correlations among mirnas and between mirnas and post mortem organismal phenotypes in swine, while also confirming previous studies in human and mouse muscle as well as c2c <dig> myoblasts.

links between mirna and mrna that relate to muscle and meat properties
this study also sought to evaluate to what extent the co-expression modules of trait-associated mrnas are themselves regulated by mirnas. a regulatory link between mirna and mrna and a functional link to the organismal phenotype was suspected if  the mrna belonged to either one of the co-expression modules associated with the traits ,  mrna abundance was significantly negatively correlated with its mirna regulator, and  the mrna was predicted to be a target gene of the respective mirna. therefore, refseqs of the genes with present calls from the 3′-ivt-affymetrix arrays were explored to predict the targets of mirnas by either seed sequence complementarity  <cit>  or by thermodynamics-based modeling of rna:rna duplex interactions  <cit> . currently, no publicly-accessible database covers porcine mirnas and their predicted target genes. moreover, annotation of porcine genes is not yet finalized. accordingly, the target predictions should be interpreted with caution.

interestingly, no mirna regulator was identified by negative correlation or target prediction in the module orange, which was enriched for genes related to “response to wounding”, “inflammatory response”, and “defense response”. genes assigned to biofunctions related to response to exogenes stimuli, change their transcription rate immediately due to many factors. as suggested by finding no correlated mirnas – their regulation of transcription may occur without major involvement of mirna. however, many genes in the module orange were previously confirmed as transcriptional regulators in myogenesis or were located in qtl regions for muscle fiber traits like btg <dig>  egr <dig>  ankrds <dig> and fos  <cit> . interestingly, the genes in module orange like egr <dig>  fos and jun that are associated with oxidative stress response were found upregulated in muscle in response to mechanical ventilation and immobilization in a porcine model for critical illness myopathy   <cit> .

co-expressed genes in module dark-turquoise were significantly associated with meat quality and based on the current knowledge of gene functions some links among them are suggested to be relevant for example, one member of this module, crem, is a transcription factor binding to camp-responsive elements  in the promoters of various genes. this transcription factor plays important roles in various organismal functions  <cit> . crem inactivation or knockout has been shown to increase the rate of apoptosis in testis tissue  <cit> . the main cellular change associated with apoptosis processes also occur during post-mortem  <cit> . post mortem biochemical processes in muscle lead to ph decline. a high expression of crem being positively correlated with ph at  <dig> hours, may indicate a slowdown of apoptosis related post mortem processes paralleling anaerobic metabolic processes that led to a decrease of ph. this indicates that the abundance of crem transcripts in muscle plays a significant role in meat quality. further, crem and mir- <dig> were highly negatively correlated  which is known to induce apoptosis in a glioblastoma cell line dbtrg-05mg  <cit> . thus a consistent link of effects on apoptosis and mrna-mirna interaction is obvious. mir- <dig> also inhibits the protein kinase b  pathway by reducing the protein level of insulin receptor substrate- <dig>   <cit> . as recently shown, mir-135a targets irs <dig> levels by binding to its 3′utr and this interaction regulates skeletal muscle insulin signaling  <cit> . insulin signaling plays a pivotal role in the regulation of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle  <cit> . the glucose uptake in skeletal muscle has large effects on meat characteristics  <cit> . in our study, irs- <dig> also belonged to module dark-turquoise and was negatively correlated with waterholding capacity related traits like dl  and positively with ph . thus another plausible functional link of members of the module dark-turquoise and mirnas can be shown.

mitochondria supply energy for physiological functions and play a significant role in the regulation of other cellular events including apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and production of reactive oxygen species. mitochondrial metabolism is affected by mirna regulation  <cit> . here, we found many mirnas being negatively correlated to target genes of modules red, black, which were enriched for genes related to mitochondrial pathways. indeed, mir- <dig> modulates energy metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial functions  <cit> , and mir-15b, - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> decrease cellular atp levels in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . additionally, mir-181c can enter and target the mitochondrial genome, ultimately causing electron transport chain complex iv remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> . here we found mir- <dig> was correlated with dl and ph24mld as well as s <dig> calcium binding protein a <dig> . further, mitochondrial genes like kif1b, atp6v1g <dig>  atp5c <dig>  park <dig>  chchd <dig>  ruvbl <dig>  mrps <dig>  and mrpl <dig> were highly negatively correlated with, and some of them were predicted as targets of, mir- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> 

many genes of modul tan were assigned in the go category “extracellular matrix” including col1a <dig>  col1a <dig>  col3a <dig>  col5a <dig>  col5a <dig>  col6a <dig>  col6a <dig>  col12a <dig>  col14a <dig>  crispld <dig>  ddn, fbn <dig>  nid <dig>  nid <dig>  ogn, and postn. these genes were negatively correlated with, and some of them were predicted as targets of, mirna. interestingly, col6a <dig> was found as a target for many mirnas including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  moreover, mir- <dig> was identified as a regulator of col1a <dig>  maged <dig>  and dpysl <dig>  gandellini et al.   <cit>  reported that mir- <dig> controls the deposition of laminin- <dig> and its receptor integrin-β <dig> as well as participates in a network involving Δnp63α, which is essential for maintenance of the basement membrane in prostate epithelium. similarly, other mirnas, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  are involved in the regulation of development and maintenance of extracellular matrix of bone and muscle  <cit> .

much evidence suggests that a group of mirnas  may contribute to the regulation of a set of common targets  <cit> , and are, therefore, associated with phenotypes. wgcna was used here to group mirna products and revealed  <dig> modules associated with meat quality . the mirna from these modules were negatively correlated to mrnas, and some of these were predicted as targets. most mirnas in module purple were related to genes in the categories “ubiquitin” or “protein catabolic process” . differential expression of genes of the ubiquitin system depending on muscle and meat quality was previously shown; only recently also association of genes of the ubiquitin system with meat quality was reported  <cit> . in particular, mir- <dig> was highly negatively correlated and predicted to target ube2e <dig>  ube2v <dig>  bap <dig>  lpf and cic.

most previous muscle mrna and mirna expression studies focused on cardiac muscle or skeletal muscle injury  <cit> . in these injuries, the degree of damage results from an imbalance of energy, nutrients, and oxygen supply-and-demand in muscle cells. similarly, nutrient, energy, and oxygen depletion occurs post mortem. many changes in expression associated with muscle injury would therefore overlap with post mortem processes in conversion of muscle to meat, and vice versa. in this regard, functional annotation of mrna co-expression and trait-correlated expression identified key post mortem pathways and functions, including glucose metabolic process, mitochondrial metabolic pathways, and muscle structural components, involved in muscle-to-meat conversion that will be relevant to muscle injury as well.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, for the first time, expression and co-expression of mirnas—functioning as a fine-tuning of mrna transcription and translation—was integrated with mrna transcript abundance measures and phenotypic data on meat quality. by this an additional hierarchical level, i.e. mirna affecting mrna, was considered in the molecular regulation of muscle-to-meat conversion. mirnas are necessary for proper skeletal and cardiac muscle development and function, and have a profound influence on multiple myopathies, such as hypertrophy, dystrophy, and conduction defects. consequently, an expression biomarker panel  derived from this study may not only be predictive for quality of meat post mortem, but also for many muscle pathologic processes including muscle atrophy, dystrophy, and hypoxia  <cit> . the abundance of mrnas and their fine-tuning by corresponding mirnas in molecular pathways related to mitochondrial metabolic balance and oxidative stress, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as muscle structural protein composition play an important role in these myopathies and meat maturation. functional studies of the interactions among and between mrnas and μrnas will provide additional experimental data for validation of the relationships on the level of mrnas, mirnas and organismal phenotype that were stressed in this study.
