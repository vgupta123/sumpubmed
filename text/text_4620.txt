BACKGROUND
epstein-barr virus  is a ubiquitous gamma-herpesvirus highly prevalent in all human populations. the virus is associated with both non-malignant diseases and a number of human cancers. after the first discovery of ebv particles in cultured lymphoma cells from patients with burkitt’s lymphoma   <cit> , ebv and its encoded molecules were also detected in other disease processes and malignancies such as undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma   <cit> , infectious mononucleosis  <cit> , hodgkin’s disease  <cit> , and gastric carcinoma  <cit>  etc.

eight ebv whole-genome sequences have been reported from previous studies. b95- <dig> , derived from a north american case of infectious mononucleosis  <cit> , was the first completely sequenced ebv genome. a more complete 171 kb wild-type ebv reference genome, wt-ebv,  was later constructed using b95- <dig> as a backbone while an 12 kb missing fragment in the ebv genome was provided by the ebv sequence found in raji cells  <cit> . ag <dig>  from a western african case of burkitt’s lymphoma is the only complete type  <dig> ebv sequence to date  <cit> ; gd <dig> , gd <dig>  and hknpc <dig>  are all ebv genomes derived from npc patients or npc tumours. specifically, gd <dig> was isolated from the saliva of an npc patient, while gd <dig> and hknpc <dig> were isolated from an npc tumour or tumour biopsy. gd <dig> was sequenced using the conventional shotgun sequencing. gd <dig> and hknpc <dig> were very recently sequenced using the next generation sequencing  illumina platform  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> ebv genomes, akata  and mutu , were reported recently from cases of burkitt’s lymphomas from japan and kenya, respectively, by ngs technology  <cit> .

our laboratory has recently established a new high throughput sequencing  capability using the miseq platform. currently, we are evaluating various workflows using different programs/tools for the effective detection of a target viral genome as well as novel viral genes in computational analysis of massive amounts of sequencing data generated by ngs technology. our objective is to effectively detect and characterize infectious viruses in human host cells or tissues intended as therapeutic biologics by using the new technology. for this purpose, we conducted an experimental genomic sequencing study of  <dig> human b cell lines that underwent spontaneous immortalization promoted by infection of the cell culture with mycoplasma  <cit> . these  <dig> immortalized human b lymphocyte cell lines were previously shown to be monoclonal in nature and positive for the ebv lmp <dig> antigen  <cit> . using available computational tools, we identified and extracted ebv sequences from genomic sequencing data of the  <dig> b-lymphocyte cell lines, assembled them into single genomes and compared them with the sequences of all the ebv genomes previously reported to the genbank. in addition, we identified and extracted ebv sequences from the  <dig> human genomes project sequences which had been deposited in ncbi for comparison. the project has been studying human genomic dna of human peripheral blood b lymphocytes immortalized by ebv infections in culture. the present study provided a rapid genomic comparison and characterization of ebv strains associated with different human diseases along with their pathogenesis and geographical distributions.

RESULTS
taxonomic classification of sequences obtained from miseq
dnas were isolated from the cultures of  <dig> previously established, spontaneously immortalized human b lymphocyte cell lines  for genomic sequencing. a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads of 168-base paired-end reads were generated by the miseq sequencer resulting in  <dig>  gb of sequence data from the k4413-mi cell line. similarly, a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads of 198-base paired-end reads resulting in  <dig>  gb of sequence data were collected from the k4123-mi cell line. those short reads that passed quality control filtering were first aligned to the database of human reference genome sequences . after removing the sequencing reads that aligned with human reference genome database, the remaining reads were aligned against the bacterial, fungal, and viral nucleotide databases sequentially  to determine the sequence composition using clc genomic workbench . of the  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads from k4413-mi cell line,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  were classified as human, bacteria, fungi, and virus related sequences, respectively . of the  <dig> , <dig> original reads from k4123-mi cell line,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were classified as human, bacteria, fungi, and virus related sequences, respectively .

of the virus-related reads identified in both cell lines,  <dig> % of  <dig>  reads in the k4413-mi cell line and  <dig> % of  <dig>  reads in the k4123-mi cell line were classified as ebv-specific sequences . in the k4413-mi cell line virus-related reads, there were  <dig> short reads classified as sequences related to enterobacteria phage phix <dig>  there were  <dig> and  <dig> short reads classified as “other herpesvirus” in k4413-mi and k4123-mi cell line virus-related reads, respectively .

assembly of ebv genomes from sequences mapping with wt-ebv
in order to assemble the k4413-mi and k4123-mi ebv genomes, we mapped the total sequencing reads of k4413-mi and k4123-mi to the reported ebv reference genome  separately using the clc genomics workbench. the mapped reads were considered to represent ebv-related sequences. overall  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> total reads in one lymphocyte line  and  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> total reads in the second lymphocyte line  were identified as ebv-related sequences. the ebv-related sequences identified in k4413-mi cell line covered  <dig> % of the entire reference wt-ebv genome. the average coverage was  <dig> -fold. there were  <dig> gaps in the k4413-mi ebv genome assembled, with gap lengths varying from 1 bp to 105 bp. the total gap length was 352 bp. for the k4123-mi ebv genome assembly, the ebv-related sequences identified covered 99% of the wt-ebv reference genome. the average coverage was  <dig> -fold. there were  <dig> gaps in the k4123-mi ebv genome assembled, and the gap length varied from 1 bp to 177 bp. the total gap length was 993 bp. finally, the complete genome of k4413-mi ebv was  <dig>  bp . the k4123-mi ebv genome was  <dig>  bp . both genomes have a gc-content of  <dig> %. both genomes were also annotated using the information derived from the reference genome of wt-ebv  sequence, and submitted to genbank .

identification and extraction of ebv sequences from na <dig> data
to evaluate if the bioinformatics tool used in the study could be equally effective in identifying and characterizing viral genome sequences from much more massive human genome sequencing data generated by ngs technology and to compare genome sequences of ebv identified in our “spontaneously” immortalized b cells with those in b cells transformed by acute ebv infection in culture, we downloaded sequencing raw data from ncbi of  <dig> human genomes project. in the human <dig> genomes project , human genomic dna was isolated from human b cells immortalized by ebv infection in culture  <cit>  and deeply sequenced. the human genomic sequences obtained by this project have been deposited in ncbi. in this study we identified and extracted the ebv sequences from na <dig> human genomic sequences deposited in ncbi for comparison with ebvs in our b-cell lines. we downloaded  <dig> , <dig> illumina 36 bp short reads from ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/data/na12878/sequence_read/ and used clc genomics workbench software to map these reads with the wt-ebv reference genome . in the total reads downloaded,  <dig> , <dig>  short reads mapped with the wt-ebv and covered 100% of the reference genome. we assembled the na <dig> ebv genome sequence from the raw reads mapping to the wt-ebv. we obtained a single contig with  <dig>  bp consensus sequence from the assembly. we named the consensus sequence of the ebv genome na <dig> ebv. it was estimated that each immortalized human lymphocyte induced by infection of b95- <dig> ebv carried  <dig> copies of ebv genomes.

since the large majority of the human peripheral blood b lymphocytes used in the human genomes study were transformed in culture by infections of b95- <dig> strain of ebv, it was surprising that the segment of sequence  between 139 kb and 151 kb of wt-ebv genome that b95- <dig> ebv genome does not possess could also be found in the assembled na <dig> ebv consensus genome sequence. further analysis however revealed this specific ~ 12 kb segment of gene sequences  was being covered less than 1/ <dig> folds compared with the average  <dig> -fold coverage of the rest of ebv genome. it appeared a small portion of human peripheral blood b cells transformed by b95- <dig> strain of ebv in  <dig> human genomes project might already be infected by ebvs carrying the gene segment that was not present in b95- <dig> ebv. but the sequencing data clearly demonstrated the large majority of ebv genome sequences deposited in the project appeared to be closely related to the b95-b strain lacking this specific segment of genes.

k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv are more closely related to b95- <dig>  wt-ebv, mutu and na <dig> ebv
pair-wise alignment of the newly assembled k4413-mi ebv, k4123-mi ebv, na <dig> ebv and  <dig> other ebv strains previously reported to genbank with the wt-ebv genomic sequence was performed. figure  <dig> shows the comparison result displayed by using the mvista program . overall sequence similarities for the wt-ebv genome with the  <dig> other ebv genomes are high: k4413-mi ebv , k4123-mi ebv , na <dig> ebv , b95- <dig> , akata , mutu , gd <dig> , gd <dig> , hknpc , ag <dig> . the region  with highly repetitive sequence in the ebv genome where majority of gaps and ambiguity reads occurred was not included for the genomic comparison . figure  <dig> shows that sequences in orip , ir  <dig>   <dig> , and tr  regions among the ebv genomes have lower similarity. there were also many sequence variations in polymorphic genes, such as ebna-3a, 3b, and 3c among these ebv genomes .

more importantly, comparison of sequences in the region spanning ebna3a, 3b and 3c for k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv against wt-ebv genome revealed much higher similarity with those of the b95- <dig> and mutu genomes, but very different from the sequence in this region of the ag <dig> genome.

phylogenetic comparison for the genomic sequences of k4413-mi and k4123-mi ebv with other ebvs associated with various human diseases and from different geographic areas
multiple sequence alignment of k4413-mi ebv, k4123-mi ebv, and the other  <dig> ebv genome sequences was performed using the kalign program in ebi  and the neighbour-joining trees were constructed using mega  <dig> software  . phylogenetic analysis revealed that k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv were more closely related to b95- <dig>  wt-ebv and na <dig> ebv. they were more different from gd <dig>  gd <dig>  and hknpc <dig>  ebvs associated with npc found in china and hong kong as well as akata, ebv from a case of burkitt’s lymphoma found in japan. they were most different from ag <dig>  the type  <dig> ebv found in a case of the western african burkitt’s lymphoma. interestingly, mutu ebv from a case of burkitt’s lymphoma in kenya is found to be more closely related to k4413-mi ebv, k4123-mi ebv and b95- <dig> and wt-ebv . phylogenetic trees generated from the alignment of translated amino acid sequences of lmp <dig> and ebna- <dig> also showed that k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv are more distant from the npc associated ebvs and akata strain of ebv from burkitt’s lymphoma in east asia .

identification of variations from  <dig> immortalized human b cell lines
we used the clc genomics workbench to identify variations, including single-nucleotide variants , indels  in k4413-mi and k4123-mi ebvs. in comparison with the wt-ebv reference genome, a total of  <dig> variants with genome-wide distribution were found in the k4413-mi ebv genomes . among them,  <dig> variants were homogenous snvs;  <dig> variants were heterogeneous snvs. in addition, there were  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions. there were  <dig> variants located in the coding regions and  <dig> variants were non-synonymous substitutions . in comparison with the wt-ebv reference genome, a total of  <dig> variants with similar genome-wide distribution were found in the k4123-mi ebv genome . among them,  <dig> variants were homogenous snvs;  <dig> variant was heterogeneous snv. in addition, there were  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions. among these variants,  <dig> variants were located in the coding region and  <dig> variants were non-synonymous substitutions .

it is important to note that k4413-mi and k4123-mi shared  <dig> common variants . the common variants were apparently clustered in certain specific regions, e.g., from 6 kb to 10 kb, which is the region that encodes eber- <dig>   <dig>  and contains the orip , and from 79 kb to 83 kb, the region that encodes ebna <dig> etc .

discussion
we are evaluating the capability of detecting/characterizing infectious viruses in human host cells through hts genomic sequencing using the illumina miseq platform and different computational tools. in this study, we examined  <dig> human b lymphocyte cell lines that underwent spontaneous immortalization promoted by mycoplasma infection of the cell culture using the illumina miseq platform. we used the hts data analytic program, clc genomics workbench, to classify the massive short sequence reads  generated from genomic sequencing of the  <dig> cell lines by mapping these sequences with human, bacterial, fungal, and viral genomic databases from ncbi database respectively . the majority of reads obtained , that was classified as human sequences, had approximately  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold coverage of a diploid human genome .

consensus ebv genomes were constructed according to the mapping result of the raw read with wt-ebv by using the clc genomics workbench. the k4413-mi ebv consensus genome was assembled by using  <dig>  ebv-related reads , had  <dig>  bp in length with ~  <dig> -fold coverage of ebv genome. thus, it is estimated that there are ~ <dig> copies  of ebv genome in a single cell of the k4413-mi lymphocyte cell line. similarly, the k4123-mi ebv genome was assembled by using  <dig>  ebv-related reads, and was  <dig>  bp in length with ~  <dig> -fold coverage of the ebv genome. it is estimated that there are ~ <dig> copies  of the ebv genome in a single cell of the k4123-mi lymphocyte cell line. the genome copy numbers of ebv found in these resting human b lymphocytes that underwent spontaneous immortalization are apparently higher than those previously reported in the undifferentiated npc tumours. in gd <dig>  there were ~  <dig> copies of ebv genome found in a single npc tumour cell  <cit> . in comparison, the na <dig> ebv genome constructed from ncbi database revealed an average of  <dig> copies of ebv genome in each immortalized human lymphocyte induced by infection of b95- <dig> ebv in culture. it appears that there are many more copies of ebv genomes that are present in each transformed human b lymphocyte induced by acute b95- <dig> ebv infection than in spontaneously transformed ebv-positive b-cell promoted by infections of mycoplasma. the copy number of ebv genomes found in an npc tumour cell is evidently the lowest.

analysis of our results show that some sequences, albeit very few, obtained in the genomic sequencing of k4413-mi and k4123-mi human lymphocyte cell lines mapped to bacteria, fungi, and non-ebv viruses . none-biased parallel hts is capable of picking up trace amounts of dna molecules present in culture media and serum. most of the bacteria-related sequences were mapped to enterobacteria. when matched with the ncbi viral database using the clc genomics workbench,  <dig> reads in k4413-mi cell line were found to be enterobacteria phage phix <dig>  it is possible that the bacteria in the medium also carried the enterobacteria phage phix <dig>  consistent with the original study finding  <cit> , no mycoplasma sequence was identified in these cell lines. there are  <dig> reads in k4413-mi cell line and  <dig> reads in k4123-mi were classified to be other herpesvirus-related sequence, not the ebv virus . we conducted the individual blastn for these  <dig> reads. most of these reads also matched with ebv virus with low homology, and some reads matched with human sequence. in this context,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of reads showed “no hits” in mapping against the  <dig> genomic databases  for the k4413-mi and k4123-mi cell lines, respectively. when these sequences were mapped using blastn against ncbi non-redundant databases, most of these sequences were found to be human sequences. the clc genomics workbench is a very powerful tool for ngs data analysis. it allows us to quickly identify the read composition from the massive amount of data. we also can effectively detect and assemble the target viral ebv genome with the clc genomics workbench. of course, all software programs have its advantages and drawbacks. for bioinformatics tools, parameter settings and databases used will affect the outcome of the analysis. different bioinformatics tools are likely to produce different results. we also tried the dnastar, soap package, bwa and other bioinformatics tools for our analysis. the results are slightly different from using the clc genomics workbench . in this study, we only present our analysis with the clc program.

whole-genome sequencing of ebv in the infected cells enabled the determination and thus comparison of ebv variations at the genome level. the constructed genomes of k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv are highly similar to each other and to the  <dig> other reported ebv genomes in the genbank. however, there are apparent degrees of variations among the genomes of these ebvs studied. phylogenetic comparison of these ebv genomes revealed that k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv are more closely related to b95- <dig>  ebv isolated from a patient with infectious mononucleosis. they are evidently more distant from gd <dig>  gd <dig>  and hknpc <dig>  ebvs associated with npc tumours. specific comparison for the two particular ebv genes  that were considered risk-loci in npc  <cit>  and commonly used for classification also revealed that k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv are closer to b95- <dig> and more different from npc-related ebvs . furthermore, both k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv lacked the 30 bp deletion at the carboxyl terminus and a specific amino acid substitution  at codon  <dig> with reference to gly in b95- <dig> lmp <dig>  a feature that was reportedly present in over 90% of ebvs found in npc biopsies  <cit> . moreover, k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv were evidently more distant from ag <dig>  ebv isolated from african burkitt’s lymphoma . specific comparison of sequences in the ebna <dig> region that had been used for classification of different ebv subtypes  <cit> , similarly revealed k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv were more closely related to b95- <dig>  a subtype  <dig> ebv . they were most distant from ag <dig>  a subtype  <dig> ebv from the western african case of burkitt’s lymphoma.

inclusion of the  <dig> most recently reported sequences of ebv genomes, akata and mutu, in our analysis of genomic sequence variations reveals the significant geographical distribution factor in addition to the factors of disease or tissue association. k4413-mi ebv and k4123-mi ebv are clearly more closely related to b95- <dig> strain and wt-ebv and more different from gd <dig>  gd <dig> and hknpc <dig> ebvs associated with npc in the east asia and akata-ebv strain from a japanese case of burkitt’s lymphoma. they are clearly most different from the ebv of western africa case of burkitt’s lymphoma. however, it is interesting to find that mutu, ebv strain from a kenya case of burkitt’s lymphoma in the east africa is more closely related to k4413-mi ebv, k4123-mi ebv, b95- <dig> and wt-ebv found in the north america . more genome sequencing data of ebvs from different geographic regions in the world in the future could provide important information of the history or the route of ebv dissemination as well as its evolution. in this study, the geographical distribution factor in sequence variations among these ebvs can similarly be observed from the alignments of translated amino acid sequences of lmp <dig> and ebna- <dig> genes among these ebvs of different origins .

it may also be important to note that there were  <dig> heterogeneous snps found in the k4413-mi ebv genome. there was also  <dig> heterogeneous snps found in the k4123-mi ebv genome. the finding would suggest that there could be more than two ebv variants or quasi species within the k4413-mi cell and k4123-mi cell.

CONCLUSIONS
we used the illumina miseq sequencing platform, a ngs technology and convenient computational tools, clc genomics workbench, to identify and extract ebv sequences from human b lymphocyte cell lines that underwent spontaneous immortalization promoted by infection of mycoplasma in culture. genomes of ebvs identified in the  <dig> immortalized human b lymphocytes were constructed and compared with all the other ebv genomes available in genbank. the study has demonstrated how viral agents in infected human cells could be rapidly identified, characterized and compared at the genomic level through genomic sequencing and effective computational analysis. the ebvs found in these human b lymphocytes are most closely related to b95- <dig> and wt-ebv. they are less similar to ebvs found in npc and burkitt’s lymphoma found in the east asia. they are most different from ebv associated with the western african burkitt’s lymphoma based on whole genome sequences.
