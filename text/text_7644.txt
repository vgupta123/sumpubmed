BACKGROUND
microarray technology allows to analyze the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment  <cit> . the identification of genes whose expression changes in pathological conditions or upon exposure to stimuli, such as pharmacologic treatment, is a very common aim of microarray-based studies. in this respect, different statistical tests, generally based on measures of distance between classes, have been so far proposed  <cit> . among them, two parameters of receiver operating characteristic  curves, namely the area under the curve , and the partial area at a selected high specificity threshold , have been applied for such a purpose  <cit> . a roc curve represents the relationship between the true positive fraction  and the false positive fraction  resulting from a set of binary classification tests based on each possible decision threshold value  <cit> . tpf is commonly known as sensitivity, while fpf corresponds to  <dig> â€“ specificity. when a roc curve is drawn using a specific gene expression profile, auc estimates the probability that a subject randomly selected from one class  has an expression value higher than a subject randomly selected from the other class   <cit> .

in case of unimodal distributions in the two classes with similar variance and different mean, the corresponding roc curve tends to lie completely above the diagonal line and to be concave . in the case of two unimodal distributions with similar mean and variance in the two classes, the corresponding roc curve will approach the rising diagonal . this particular roc curve is often named the "chance line", because it represents the set of all the possible statistical tests with equal probability for a true positive and a false positive result, i.e., corresponding to the set of results expected by chance alone. in such a case auc will tend to  <dig> . however, auc values close to  <dig>  may also be obtained from genes differentially expressed among two classes, when the presence of a hidden bimodal or multimodal distribution in either class causes the roc curve to cross the chance line  <cit> , like the not concave  curve iii and curve iv in figure  <dig>  bimodal or multi-modal distributions within a class may indicate the presence of unknown subclasses with different expression values  <cit> . as a consequence, the identification of such subclasses may provide useful insights about biological mechanisms underlying physiologic or pathologic conditions. however, most expression profiles corresponding to not proper roc curves  are likely to be discharged by the commonly used feature selection methods , because either mean or median values tend to be similar between the considered groups.

to allow the identification of different kind of differentially expressed genes, we have developed a new statistical method of feature selection based on the area between the roc curve and the rising diagonal . furthermore, to separate nprc  from both uninformative and proper roc plots  we have developed a new approach based on the combination of standard feature selection procedures based either on auc or on t test with a new statistical test based on a simple variant of abcr .

the performance of our method was evaluated by comparing the gene expression profiles in two different classes, using data from a publicly available data base including  <dig> gene expression profiles  <cit> . class a included  <dig> different samples of normal circulating b cells , class b included  <dig> heterogeneous lymphomas. class a and b both included two subclasses, namely:  <dig> heavily stimulated and  <dig> slightly stimulated or unstimulated samples in class a ;  <dig> follicular lymphomas  and  <dig> chronic lymphocytic leukemias  in class b.

note: sample number  corresponds to the original location of each sample in the original data set: .

the aim of this study is to illustrate a new comprehensive approach based on the combination of both standard  and new  roc parameters. moreover, we show how not proper roc curves, identified by tnrc, may allow at the same time both to select differentially expressed genes that tend to escape standard statistical tools, and to point out the presence of hidden subclasses with biological or clinical meaning. for such purposes, we selected the genes with the highest abcr value corresponding to an a priori chosen false discovery rate   <cit> . among the expression profiles selected by abcr we identified over-expressed and under-expressed genes using either the area under the roc curve  or the student's t statistic, which both represent standard methods for feature selection in microarray analysis  <cit> . nprc were identified by high values of tnrc statistic. a conventional unadjusted p value of  <dig>  was used as threshold in each analysis. furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of each selected nprc, to assess the concordance between the observed gene expression and the presence of hidden subclasses .

the fdr of both standard  and new proposed statistics  was also estimated under some different distribution hypotheses and at different sample size by using artificial data sets containing  <dig> simulated gene expression profiles in two classes. finally, the distribution of abcr and tnrc at some different sample size under the null hypothesis of no differentially expressed genes between two classes was estimated by extensive random permutation analysis.

RESULTS
we grouped all the genes discussed below as follows: lymphocyte/macrophage related genes , major histocompatibility complex related genes , genes involved in malignant cell transformation , genes related to nucleic acid metabolism or dna transcription , and gene encoding various enzymes/kinases and other proteins . in spite of some overlap, this classification allows to subdivide the tested genes according to their functional features.

our method identified  <dig> genes with the highest value of abcr at a selected fdr of 15%. the estimated selection probability ranged from 40% to 100% . figure 2a shows the results of the selection procedure combining the new proposed tnrc statistic with the standard auc on the subset of  <dig> genes selected by abcr. area i includes  <dig> genes with a statistically significant tnrc value , while areas ii and iii collect  <dig> genes with a statistically significant auc value. in particular, genes in area ii  were found to be under-expressed in class a compared with class b, while genes in area iii  were found to be over-expressed in class a. no genes corresponding to nprc were identified by auc statistic and vice versa. however,  <dig> genes  were not identified by either auc or tnrc. the large majority of them  had a borderline statistically significant value of auc , but not for tnrc, while  <dig> genes had a borderline p value for tnrc, but not for auc. the analysis was repeated using t statistic in place of auc, and the corresponding results are summarized in figure 2b. also in this case, no gene with statistically significant tnrc value was identified by the standard statistical method . however, the separation between this two different kind of differentially expressed genes was less evident than that obtained by using auc . moreover, a larger number of genes  remained unclassified , including some genes with a very low value for both tnrc and t statistics.

group 1: lymphocyte/macrophage related genes; group 2: major histocompatibility complex related genes; group 3: genes involved in malignant cell transformation; group 4: genes related to nucleic acid metabolism or dna transcription; group 5: genes encoding various enzymes/kinases and other proteins. abcr: area between the roc curve and the rising diagonal; tnrc: test for not-proper roc curves.

group 1: lymphocyte/macrophage related genes; group 2: major histocompatibility complex related genes; group 3: genes involved in malignant cell transformation; group 4: genes related to nucleic acid metabolism or dna transcription; group 5: genes encoding various enzymes/kinases and other proteins. abcr: area between the roc curve and the rising diagonal; auc = area under the roc curve; "+" = overexpressed; "-" = underexpressed.

all the analyses were repeated varying the fdr threshold. at fdr = 10%,  <dig> genes were identified by abcr. among them,  <dig>  were called over- or under-expressed on the basis of auc statistic,  <dig> genes corresponding to nprc were identified by tnrc and  <dig> were not identified by either statistic. among these latter,  <dig> had a borderline statistical significant value for auc and  <dig> for tnrc. also in this case, no genes identified by auc were also selected by tnrc and vice versa. finally, using fdr = 20% for abcr,  <dig> genes were selected. among them,  <dig>  were selected by auc,  <dig> by tnrc, and  <dig> remained not classified, including  <dig> genes with a borderline statistical significance for auc and  <dig> for tnrc. also in this case no genes were identified as differentially expressed by both auc and tnrc.

because the main sources of heterogeneity were known a priori for both class a , which included differently stimulated cells, and for class b, which included samples from two different malignant diseases , we carried out a detailed analysis of each roc curve obtained from the expression values of genes listed in table  <dig> . figures from  <dig> to  <dig> were ordered according to the ranks of the corresponding genes in table  <dig>  i.e., figure  <dig> refers to the expression of gene n.  <dig>  figure  <dig> corresponds to gene n.  <dig>  and so on. each plot reports both the origin of samples in class b  and the two major subclasses within nbc class, according to table  <dig> . moreover, each plot was arbitrarily split into two parts to roughly separate samples with high  and with low  expression level. finally, the roc curves in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were classified as "sigmoid-shaped"  and "inversely sigmoid-shaped" .

six out of the  <dig> genes in table  <dig> corresponded to sigmoid-shaped curves . four curves allowed to identify the two hidden subgroups of highly stimulated and slightly or not stimulated b cells, with no error for figure  <dig> ,  <dig> error for figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . all the remaining  <dig> genes in figure  <dig> corresponded to inversely-sigmoid shaped curves and they allowed to separate the two hidden subclasses within class b , with the only exception of figure  <dig> . in more detail, the identification of the two hidden subclasses was made with no error in  <dig> cases , with  <dig> error in  <dig> cases , with  <dig> errors in  <dig> cases , and  <dig> errors in  <dig> case . in summary, only  <dig> out of  <dig> roc curves  were not associated with the presence of a priori known hidden subclasses.

discussion
in this paper we have illustrated a new feature selection method using a combination of standard  and new  statistical tools based on roc curves properties. in particular, abcr represents a new comprehensive test to identify both proper and not proper roc curves. because abcr is a measure of the distance between the cumulative distributions of the two classes under study , it may be used to potentially identify any kind of differentially expressed genes. auc represents a well known useful tool to identify under- and over-expressed genes in the comparison between two classes  <cit> , while tnrc represents a new tool to specifically identify nprc. as illustrated in figure 2a, where genes selected by abcr were separated on the basis of auc and tnrc values, all the genes identified by tnrc tended to escape feature selection based on auc and vice versa. this behavior was also confirmed when auc was replaced by t statistic, another standard feature selection tool  <cit> , and when two different thresholds for fdr were used . these results strongly point out that tnrc can identify differentially expressed genes that are hardly identifiable by standard statistical tools.

the large majority of genes selected by abcr were identifiable by auc or t statistic and, accordingly, they resulted either under- or over-expressed in lymphoma cells compared with nbc. nprc represented a very small fraction of the selected genes. this finding might be due to the fact that tnrc statistic tends to identify gene expression profiles that are different in two or more subclasses within one class compared with another, a condition that may be quite rare in real data. however, as indicated by results of simulation analysis  the main limit of tnrc is probably its low statistical power. simulation analysis was based on a very simplified scenario, because data were generated from a few variety of statistical distributions  and the correlation between gene expression profiles was not taken into account. however, in spite of such limitations, the comparison between tnrc, abcr and auc clearly indicated a poor performance of tnrc compared with the two latter statistics . as a consequence, in microarray experiments with small sample size tnrc can probably recover only a minor proportion of differentially expressed genes that have escaped standard feature selection methods. however, as illustrated in figure 2a and 2b, tnrc represents a complementary tool for microarray data that may supplement information from standard statistical analysis. moreover, the rapid improvements in microarray technology and the consequent availability of chips with a low cost and a high quality might allow a very extensive application of tnrc method in the next future.

we have arbitrarily chosen the conventional threshold of p =  <dig>  to separate different kinds of gene expression profiles . it is evident from figure 2a, where only roc parameters were used, that varying the selected thresholds, almost all unselected genes may have been included in one out of the three considered categories . using t statistic in place of auc  a less clear separation between such genes was obtained, leaving a higher number of expression profiles as not classified. in particular, some genes, corresponding to the central low region of the plot , showed low values of both tnrc and t statistics. this finding is not surprising, because such genes were selected on the basis of abcr statistic, which may take high values even in the presence of a small difference between mean values in the two classes that cause t statistic to approach zero, a phenomenon that may be due to one or more outliers.

our results confirmed the hypothesis that nprc  may correspond to genes, whose expression profile is influenced by the presence of hidden subgroups in either class. in particular, when applied to the comparison between the semi-artificial class b, which included fl and cll samples, and the class a, which included  <dig> nbc ,  <dig> out of  <dig> selected genes were able to separate almost perfectly the two hidden subgroups within either one class. in particular, the first three selected profiles in table  <dig>  corresponding to three clones of the same gene , highlighted the over-expression of all fl samples and the under-expression of all cll samples , with only one exception, i.e., a sample of over-expressed cll. interestingly, this sample was the same in the three clones   <cit> . j chain is a 137-amino acid protein that is synthesized in b lymphocytes and subserves  <dig> known functions: linking immunoglobulin monomers  and binding polymeric immunoglobulin to secretory component  <cit> . differential expression of the immunoglobulin j chain gene in fl vs b-cll has not been reported so far and its functional significance is unknown. the possibility that our findings reflect a statistical artifact is made unlikely by the concordant results obtained from the analysis of three different clones of the gene . further studies will help to better define this issue. among the sigmoid shaped curves, which indicate the presence of two hidden sub-classes within nbc samples, the gene with the highest tnrc value was indicated as gene3407x  and corresponded to the histone deacetylase  <dig>  the corresponding roc plot  allowed to perfectly separate hst from sst cells. histone deacetylase  <dig>  shares functional features with hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  these include deacetylation of histone substrates, promoter targeted transcriptional repression and physical association with the dna binding factor yy <dig>  <cit> . hdca <dig> forms a stable complex with nuclear receptor corepressor  and silencing mediator of retinoic and thyroid receptors . beside to the direct effect on histone deacetylation, the hdac3-n-cor complex can exert broader functions in regulating chromatin structure. aberrant expression and/or localization of hdca <dig> have been reported in various solid tumors and myeloid leukemia  <cit> .

tnrc is a supervised method of statistical analysis that, as illustrated above, may help in the identification of hidden subgroups, a task in general performed by unsupervised clustering. this latter technique has been proven to be very useful in microarray data analysis  <cit> , because it may exploit the correlation between different gene expressions, and may identify genes that are likely to escape supervised feature selection, including tnrc and standard analysis based on auc or t values. in particular, a different expression profile within a very small sub-class  is in general hardly identifiable by supervised tests, due to their low statistical power in the presence of small sample size in either one class. conversely, unsupervised methods tend to generate false clusters even in the presence of random values from uniform probability functions, a behavior that probably represents the major limit of such technique. moreover, single expression profiles corresponding to nprc may completely escape unsupervised selection method if they are weakly or not correlated to other gene expressions, but they are potentially identifiable by tnrc. further studies are needed to find suitable strategies to combine unsupervised methods with supervised techniques, including our proposed approach, in microarray data analysis. finally, the possible use of the new proposed statistics, and in particular of abcr, to select genes useful for classification methods  <cit>  should also be explored.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we have illustrated a new approach for feature selection in microarray data analysis based on a combination of new and standard statistical tools exploiting the properties of roc curves. our method may identify both proper roc plots, using the conventional auc statistic, and nprc, corresponding to high values of the new proposed tnrc parameter. auc is a well known useful tool to identify over- and under-expressed genes, while tnrc can identify differentially expressed genes that tend to escape standard statistical analysis. we have shown that a simple visual inspection at the plot of a nprc, selected by tnrc, may allow to identify hidden subclasses with potential clinical and biological insight. for these reasons, our results indicate that nprc represent a new flexible and useful tool for the analysis of gene expression profiles from microarray experiments.
