BACKGROUND
the dating of speciation events and investigation of the evolutionary processes involved are major themes in evolutionary biology with important implications for conservation biology. for endangered species, knowledge of these historical processes is critical for correct interpretation of current patterns of genetic variation, and guides assignment of conservation priorities and elaboration of subsequent conservation strategies  <cit> .

the classical approach to dating speciation events has been based on the molecular clock, which has proven to be an appropriate tool for addressing a wide range of evolutionary hypotheses  <cit> . however, several factors have resulted in challenges to the validity of this approach, particularly in application to recently diverged species  <cit> . firstly, accurate and appropriate calibration points are often lacking, especially for taxa with poor fossil records, including birds  <cit> . secondly, the assumptions of rate constancy over time and across lineages are often challenged. ho and colleagues  <cit>  have reported evidence indicating that the rate of molecular evolution is much faster over short time scales, and thus the timing of many recent events in evolution may have been overestimated. thirdly, the high variance in coalescent times across loci makes estimation of the divergence time based on a single genetic locus inaccurate, and highlights the need to use multiple unlinked loci. finally, due to ancestral polymorphism, gene divergence antedates species divergence by a timeframe τ that, in recently separated species, may be very large in relation to the time of split; in birds this difference is typically on the order of several hundred thousand years  <cit> .

new likelihood and bayesian methods based on coalescence theory have recently been developed for estimating species divergence times, potentially overcoming some of the above handicaps . some of these methods apply the isolation and migration  model  <cit> , which provides estimates of population divergence dates rather than gene coalescence dates, and enables pure isolation with subsequent independent evolution to be distinguished from isolation with subsequent gene flow. the model has been recently extended to make it applicable to data from multiple unlinked loci, even with different modes of inheritance  <cit> .

the status of the spanish imperial eagle  has fluctuated between threatened and vulnerable in the last  <dig> years, and it is currently classified as "vulnerable" in the iucn red list of threatened species  <cit> . with less than  <dig> breeding pairs remaining , the species is confined to the south-western quadrant of the iberian peninsula  <cit> . the population of its sister species, the eastern imperial eagle , is estimated to be  <dig> – <dig>  individuals across continental eurasia. this species is also considered "vulnerable", although under a less severe criterion  <cit>  . the spanish imperial eagle has been considered a subspecies  of the eastern imperial eagle because of similarity in diet and the main aspects of their breeding biology  <cit> , and the existence of only minor differences in the adult plumage pattern. however, noticeable differences in juvenile plumages  <cit>  and an allopatric current  distribution  <cit>  have supported their current designation as separate species  <cit> . this situation provides an interesting case study of very similar species with large differences in population sizes and distribution ranges. seibold et al.  <cit>  estimated the date of divergence of these species at around one million years ago , based on the number of differences in a single mitochondrial gene  and assuming an uncorrected rate  of mitochondrial evolution. in this regard it is widely accepted that pleistocene glaciations were important in shaping the complex pattern of extant species  <cit> . southern european peninsulas acted as isolated refugia for temperate species during glacial maxima  <cit> , allowing the accumulation of variation and divergence through allopatry over an extended time period  <cit> . during interglacial periods species spread from the refugia and recolonized the more northern european areas  <cit> . the ability to fly might have allowed birds to find refugia further south, in africa. african refugia have been suggested for eastern lineages of gypaetus barbatus  <cit>  and imperial eagles  <cit> .

in the present work we applied a modified im model  <cit>  to analyse data from an extensive survey of the distribution of a. adalberti and a. heliaca, in order to investigate the evolutionary processes explaining their divergence. specifically, we aimed to estimate divergence dates and gene flow following divergence, and assess the implications of our findings for conservation of the endangered spanish imperial eagle. the results will have implications for the taxonomy of imperial eagles and delimitation of evolutionary significant units .

RESULTS
estimates of the parameters and values of autocorrelation and ess  are listed for the three final runs performed for both sets of markers . as all runs gave similar results, we report below the estimates from the first run corresponding to the runs which had the highest ess for the parameter t .

microsatellite maximum likelihood estimates of population sizes were θ <dig> =  <dig>  , θ <dig> =  <dig>   and θa =  <dig>  , and for the mitochondrial marker were θ <dig> =  <dig>  , θ <dig> =  <dig>   and θa =  <dig>  . our estimates for θa suggest a bottleneck for both populations at the time of split from the common ancestor, and that this was more intense in the case of a. adalberti.

posterior probabilities for the divergence times are plotted in figure 2a for both marker types. in the case of the microsatellite data set, the posterior probability distribution peaked at time t =  <dig>  . the estimate of t for the mitochondrial data reached a maximum probability at t =  <dig>  . because t is scaled by the mutation rate μ, and θ = 4neμ, an estimate of time in units of 2ne generations can be obtained by dividing the ml estimate of t by one half the ml estimate of θ. for the nuclear genome we obtained an estimate of  <dig>  × 2ne generations , and for the mitochondrial d-loop the estimate was  <dig>  × 2ne generations . the ne harmonic mean for a. adalberti during the last century was estimated for  <dig> individuals  using a likelihood-based temporal approach  <cit> . assuming a mean generation time of  <dig>  years  <cit> , this results in divergence time estimates of  <dig>  ×  <dig> years ago  for the nuclear genome, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> years ago  for the mitochondrial genome. as we estimated ne for a period when the a. adalberti population had undergone a decline, the value obtained might be an underestimate of the historical population. however, ecological constraints suggest that the population has never been large  <cit> , and in a previous study we suggested that the demographic bottleneck was not strong enough to affect genetic diversity  <cit> . even with a reduction up to 20% of the historical population size , the estimated time of divergence would be  <dig>  ×  <dig> years ago  for the microsatellite marker, and  <dig>  ×  <dig> years ago  for the mitochondrial marker. calculation of divergence time from t and μ produced similar results. for the microsatellite marker, assuming a mean value of  <dig> × 10- <dig> for microsatellite mutation rates  <cit> , the estimate of time of divergence is  <dig>  ×  <dig> years ago. for the mitochondrial marker the estimated time of divergence is  <dig>  ×  <dig> years ago, assuming that the mitochondrial control region evolves  <dig>  times faster than the entire mitochondrial genome  <cit> , and thus a mean rate of evolution of  <dig>  % my- <dig> for this fragment.

gene flow is suggested by the microsatellite data but not the mitochondrial data, indicating that recurrent gene flow occurred between the two eagle populations, from a. heliaca to a. adalberti. we ran the model setting m <dig> to zero . the log likelihood ratio log  was - <dig> , suggesting the adequacy of a model that includes migration. the proportion of a. adalberti replaced by a. heliaca migrants, scaled by mutation rate, was estimated in m <dig> =  <dig>   . if the relationship 2n1m <dig> = 4n1μ × 1/ <dig> × m1/μ  <cit>  and estimates of θ and μ are used, an estimated migration of  <dig>  gene copies per generation is obtained. therefore, our analysis suggests that approximately one eastern male imperial eagle might have effectively reached the spanish imperial eagle population per generation since they started to diverge.

discussion
analysis of two independent data sets indicated that the eastern and spanish imperial eagles split from a common ancestor much more recently than has been suggested  <cit> , and that the split occurred during the holocene or the very late pleistocene. the absence of imperial eagle remains in the iberian fossil record for the entire pleistocene is consistent with the hypothesis that colonization of the iberian peninsula was very recent, on the order of several thousand years , but contradicts the previous phylogenetic estimate of one million years ago for the divergence of these species  <cit> . estimates of the population parameter θ for the ancestral and descendant populations suggest that the split would have significantly reduced the size of a large ancestral population, affecting the western descendant population to a greater extent. a recent divergence and a large effective size of the ancestral population could explain the large differences in the time of split estimated by phylogenetic and coalescent-based methods. moreover, the recent work of ho et al.  <cit> , which showed that rate of change for molecular divergence for recent evolutionary events  is much higher than the traditionally accepted 2% per million years  <cit> , would suggest that the phylogenetic estimate of one million years ago for the divergence of the two eagles is a substantial overestimation. these results also suggest the need for revision of the dating of speciation events in birds, which are often dated to the early or middle pleistocene by phylogenetic methods, and brings into question the importance of glaciation during the pleistocene in the diversification of bird species  <cit> . in the case of imperial eagles, such a recent divergence also raises questions concerning their current taxonomic status as separate species, originally proposed primarily on the basis of plumage patterns  <cit> . in this regard the occurrence of a. heliaca  plumages in both adult and juvenile a. adalberti individuals, observed in the field at low frequencies , might indicate retained ancestral polymorphism consistent with a recent separation of imperial eagles.

if imperial eagles remained isolated during repeated glacial maxima in two different glacial refugia  <cit> , our data would suggest that divergence was subsequently aborted by secondary contacts during interglacial periods, until they were finally differentiated during the last glaciation. alternatively, divergence could have occurred through a recent colonization of iberia from africa, as suggested for other steppe birds  <cit> , followed by disruption of its distribution range in northern africa. this colonization might have occurred, as there was suitable steppe habitat on the iberian peninsula  <dig>  years ago during the younger dryas period, as revealed by palynological data  <cit> . movement into the iberian peninsula could have occurred from the north of africa, where the spanish imperial eagle existed until last century  <cit> . up to 80% of bird species in northern africa are of palaearctic origin  <cit> , and the semiarid to subhumid conditions during the neolithic were probably suitable for imperial eagles in this area, while the presence of a more or less dense tree cover throughout europe may not have provided suitable habitat. more recently, the aridity in north africa since  <dig>  b.p. could have reduced animal populations to refuges  <cit> , and disrupted the distribution range of the imperial eagle. a detailed study of the phylogeography of the species, specifically including museum samples from northern africa, is necessary to test this hypothesis.

our results also indicate male-mediated gene flow from eastern imperial eagles to spanish imperial eagles after divergence. this may have occurred by eastern eagles deviating in their wintering routes to and from africa through continental italy and sicily  <cit> , and finally wintering in spain. this phenomenon has been described for other raptor species including a. clanga  and a. pomarina  . the absence of female-mediated gene flow could also be a consequence of the lower fitness of heterogametic female hybrids , as has been suggested for a. clanga and a. pomarina  <cit>  and documented for other species  <cit> . male mediated asymmetrical gene flow could explain the low mitochondrial but high nuclear diversity in spanish imperial eagles , as well as the reciprocal monophyly observed for the mitochondrial genome. therefore, reduced mitochondrial diversity, far from being a consequence of recent demographic alterations, seems to be a signature for a founder effect, a history of small ne or restricted female-mediated gene flow.

the recent split and occurrence of subsequent gene flow have implications for the taxonomic and conservation status of both imperial eagles. although the asymmetric gene flow pattern might still indicate some level of reproductive incompatibility, full reproductive isolation is contradicted by our observations of gene flow. based on the scarcity of diagnostic characters  and the low level of morphological, ecological or behavioural divergence, these taxa might be conservatively classified as allospecies based upon the criteria of helbig et al.  <cit> . finally, our results preclude rejection of historical genetic exchangeability  <cit> , and highlight the need to determine whether both allospecies represent different esus by evaluating current ecological exchangeability, ideally through an experimental approach  <cit> . if exchangeability cannot be ruled out, and if the spanish imperial eagle viability were to be compromised anew, the introduction of eastern individuals should be carefully considered  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results have shown that the split that gave rise to spanish and eastern imperial eagles was very recent, and that asymmetrical gene flow occurred after divergence. this presents a completely unexpected scenario for the evolutionary origins of imperial eagles, with implications for management strategies for the endangered a. adalberti. our work also shows the potential of coalescent-based models in inferring evolutionary processes, and illustrates the value of an historical perspective in developing a full understanding of contemporary genetic patterns, and in design of adequate conservation strategies.
