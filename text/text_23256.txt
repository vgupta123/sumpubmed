BACKGROUND
climatic oscillations in the quaternary have greatly affected the distribution and abundance of boreal and arctic species  <cit> . these species have undergone major range shifts with the advances and retreats of ice sheets. in the past two decades, numerous studies have focused on plant species in boreal regions and/or arctic latitudes and southern mountain ranges, and different phylogeographic patterns amongst plants have been revealed, especially in europe and north america . some of these studies included samples from mountains in central asia have revealed that central asia is an important refugium for boreal and arctic plants and colonization from central asia to europe or to beringia are conceivable . however, colonization routes of these species between central asia and mountains in low latitudes in asia need to be further explored. at present, our understanding of the southern range dynamics of boreal and arctic-alpine plants in asia is based mostly on data from japan . phylogeographic studies with a broader geographic sampling in asia are necessary to better elucidate evolutionary histories of boreal and arctic-alpine plants.

china provides suitable habitats for many boreal and arctic-alpine plant species in their southern range, including the qinghai-tibetan plateau  and mountain ranges in northwest china and northeast china  <cit> . two putative routes have been suggested for the migration of the flora between the qtp and the arctic regions: one is the “central asiatic highland corridor” pathway via mountain ranges in northwest china  <cit> , and another is the “himalayan-hengduan mountain-qinling-northeast china” route  <cit> . we thus hypothesized that similar colonization routes might also be present in a single species of this plant group. in addition, the qtp is considered a center of the development and differentiation of the elements from boreal or arctic-tertiary flora since the late tertiary and quaternary glacial periods  <cit> . similarly, infra-specific lineage divergence in boreal and arctic-alpine plants might also occur in this region.

to infer refugial areas and colonization routes of boreal and arctic-alpine plants in china, we should conduct phylogeographic studies on species with a widespread range covering the qtp and mountains in northeast and northwest china. in this study, we focused on hippuris vulgaris , an aquatic plant of circumboreal distribution. china is the southern range of this species in asia, and h. vulgaris is mainly distributed in the north, northeast, northwest and southwest of china  <cit> . the plant is rhizomatous perennial and often grows in fresh water at the edges of ponds, lakes and rivers. a recent chloroplast dna  phylogeography of h. vulgaris in the qtp and adjacent areas revealed a mid-to-late pleistocene split of two lineages on the qtp and possible colonization between the qtp and northwest china  <cit> , whereas no specific refugia areas were deduced and no samples from northeast china were included. we hypothesized that colonization between the qtp and northeast china was likely existed in h. vulgaris. in the present study, we used both cpdna sequences and nuclear microsatellite  data to examine the phylogeographic pattern of h. vulgaris based on a large-scale sampling covering its distribution range in china. in addition, we inferred the glacial range dynamics of h. vulgaris by using ecological niche modeling . our aims were to  test whether lineage divergence on the qtp was detected by both cpdna and nssr, and  deduced potential refugia and putative colonization routes of h. vulgaris in china. investigating these questions was conducive to  elucidating the evolutionary history of h. vulgaris in its southern range in asia.

methods
plant materials
a total of  <dig> individuals were collected at  <dig> sites throughout the distribution range of h. vulgaris in china, including northwest china, the qtp, and north and northeast  china . at each site, 1– <dig> individuals were sampled at intervals of at least 5 m according to the population size. the leaf material of each individual was collected and immediately stored in silica gel. voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of wuhan university .

dna extraction, amplification and sequencing
total genomic dna was extracted from silica-dried leaves using the dna secure plant kit . six cpdna non-coding regions were examined in preliminary experiment in  <dig> and three regions, trnh-psba  <cit> , trnq-rps <dig> and rps16-trnk  <cit> , were chosen due to their high polymorphism . polymerase chain reaction  was performed in a volume of 25 μl containing 10–30 ng of genomic dna,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig>  mm of each dntp, 2 mm mgcl <dig> and  <dig>  u of extaq dna polymerase  under the following conditions: 3 min at 95 °c, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °c, 30 s at 55 °c, and 90 s at 72 °c, and then a final 5 min extension at 72 °c. amplifications were conducted in a veriti 96-well thermal cycler . the pcr products were purified and sequenced by the beijing genomic institute in wuhan, china.

microsatellite loci development and genotyping
we developed nssr primers using the microsatellite-enriched library method. detailed methods and processes followed wu et al.  <cit> . a total of nine nssr loci were developed for subsequent analysis . microsatellites were amplified under the following conditions: 3 min at 95 °c; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °c, 30 s at 49–57 °c , and 1 min at 72 °c; and a final extension at 72 °c for 5 min. pcr products were analyzed on an abi 3730xl, and genotyping was performed using genemapper version  <dig>  software .

population genetic structure analyses
all cpdna sequences were aligned using the program mafft  <dig>   <cit> . the three chloroplast fragments were concatenated for subsequent analyses. identical sequences were collapsed into a single haplotype using dnasp  <dig>   <cit> , and all sequences of different haplotypes were deposited in genbank . a statistical parsimony network was constructed using tcs  <dig>   <cit> , treating sequence gaps as the fifth character state. in the network analysis, gaps of two or more base pairs were re-coded as single-base-pair indels.

regarding the nssr data, genetically distinct clusters of  <dig> populations were identified using an individual-based assignment approach as implemented in structure  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . ten independent runs were performed for each k value  with a burn-in period of  <dig>  iterations and  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo  iterations under the admixture model. the best-fit number of clusters was determined based on the ∆k method  <cit> . the geographical distribution of different cpdna haplotypes and nssr clusters identified was mapped using arcgis  <dig>  . for both cpdna and nssr data, analyses of molecular variance  were used to partition genetic variation among and within populations, as implemented in arlequin  <dig>   <cit> . the individuals with the same nssr genotype were removed and only one was kept within a population in genetic analyses.

phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimation
the phylogenetic relationships of cpdna haplotypes were inferred using maximum likelihood  analysis implemented in garli  <dig>   <cit> , starting from random trees and using  <dig> , <dig> generations per search. the ml bootstrap support was estimated from  <dig> bootstrap replicates in garli. bayesian inference  implemented in mrbayes  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was also used for phylogenetic reconstruction. two independent mcmc analysis runs were conducted simultaneously, beginning with a random tree, with each run including four chains . two million generations were run, with sampling at every  <dig>  generations. chain convergence was checked using tracer  <dig>   <cit> , and the first 25 % of samples were discarded as burn-in. the k81uf + i substitution model for the ml and bi analyses was identified using the akaike information criterion  implemented in modeltest  <dig>   <cit> . the divergence times of cpdna lineages were estimated by using a bayesian method implemented in beast  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . an evolutionary rate of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> s/s/y  <cit>  for the three combined cpdna non-coding regions was used to estimate divergence time under an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model. mcmc analysis of  <dig> , <dig> generations was implemented, in which every  <dig>  generations were sampled. the first 10 % of generations were discarded as burn-in, and the parameters were checked using tracer  <dig> .

demographic analyses
regarding the cpdna data, we examined pairwise mismatch distributions to detect historical demographic expansions using arlequin. the sum of squared deviations  and harpending’s raggedness index   <cit>  were used to test the goodness of fit under a sudden-expansion model. their significances were tested using a parametric bootstrap approach with  <dig>  replicates  <cit> . we also performed two powerful tests, fu’s fs test  <cit>  and the r <dig> test  <cit> , to detect potential population growth using dnasp.

present and past distribution modeling
enm was used to predict the suitable past  and present climate envelopes for each lineage , as implemented in maxent  <dig> .3 k  <cit> . in addition to the  <dig> sites in this study ,  <dig> sites from chen et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> collection records from the chinese virtual herbarium  were included. based on this total of  <dig> records, we obtained an environmental data set comprising  <dig> bioclim variables and altitudes from the worldclim database with resolutions of  <dig> ’ . we examined pairwise correlations among the  <dig> variables and retained seven environmental variables  with pairwise pearson correlation coefficients of r <  <dig>  to minimize biased fitting of niche models. a current distribution model was developed using these seven bioclimatic data layers. this model was then projected onto the lgm dataset simulated by the community climate system model v <dig>   <cit> . we used the default parameters of maxent to construct enms. the accuracy of each model prediction was evaluated using the area under the  curve .

RESULTS
chloroplast dna haplotype network
the lengths of the aligned sequences for trnh-psba, trnq-rps <dig> and rps16-trnk were  <dig>   <dig> and 829 bp, respectively. a total of  <dig> polymorphic sites, including  <dig> indels and  <dig> base substitutions, were observed in the concatenated sequences. the sequences were collapsed into  <dig> haplotypes . a haplotype network was constructed with two distinct groups: a and b . group a was restricted to mountainous areas in northeast china. group a was found in  <dig> populations, with haplotype a <dig> widespread and present in  <dig> populations, haplotypes a <dig> and a <dig> each found in two populations, and other haplotypes each restricted to a single population . group b occurred in all three regions and was found in  <dig> populations. the most common haplotype, b <dig>  was present in  <dig> populations; among the remaining  <dig> haplotypes, only b <dig> was shared between the qtp and nne china. northwest china, the qtp and nne china contained one, three, and six private haplotypes, respectively . only one population, arq <dig>  contained haplotypes from both group a  and group b  .fig.  <dig> network and chronogram of  <dig> cpdna haplotypes in hippuris vulgaris.

phylogenetic lineages and divergence time
the trees generated using ml and bi analyses showed the same topology, in which two reciprocally monophyletic lineages  were recovered with robust support . these two lineages corresponded to the two groups in the haplotype network. the divergence time of the two lineages was estimated at  <dig>  ma ago  , which yields time estimates in the early pleistocene. the diversification of lineages a and b was estimated at  <dig>  ma  and  <dig>  ma , respectively , both of which are in the mid-pleistocene.

population genetic structure
the structure analysis using ssr data suggested k =  <dig> as the optimal number of genetic clusters based on the calculation of Δk . we defined these two clusters as a and b. all individuals of  <dig> and  <dig> populations were assigned to cluster a and b with a posterior probability higher than  <dig>   and had cpdna lineages a and b, respectively . most or all individuals of nine populations were admixed with a probability range from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and had cpdna lineage a . in population arq <dig>  two individuals with admixed assignment had cpdna lineage a, and other individuals with cluster b assignment had cpdna lineage b . all of the results suggested that hybridization occurred between lineage a and b and that hybrids were produced only when lineage a was the ovulate parent. further structure analysis was also performed for cluster a and cluster b, and the optimal solution was k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  respectively . in cluster a, all individuals were admixed and no subclusters were identified . in cluster b, most individuals were assigned to three subclusters with high posterior probability . these three subclusters had different geographic distributions: subcluster i mainly occurred in nne china and northeast qtp edge, subcluster ii was mostly found in northwest china and the qtp, and subcluster iii was restricted to the qtp .

hierarchical amova revealed that most of this species’ total variation  occurred among lineages , indicating high genetic differentiation between lineage a and b. nonhierarchical amova for lineage a revealed that most of the genetic variation in both cpdna and nssr was distributed within populations . for lineage b, the amova results revealed that most of the genetic variation in both cpdna and nssr was found within populations, with a low percentage occurring among three regions , indicating frequent gene flow among populations and regions .table  <dig> analyses of molecular variance based on cpdna and nssr data for populations of hippuris vulgaris

demographic analyses
mismatch distributions for lineage a and lineage b were inconsistent with the unimodal curve expected for populations under conditions of demographic expansion . the demographic expansion of lineage a was supported by nonsignificant hrag value but not supported by significant ssd value and fu’s fs and r <dig> tests. similarly, the demographic expansion of lineage b was supported by nonsignificant hrag and ssd values but not supported by fu’s fs and r <dig> tests . these findings suggest that recent population expansion is not present in either of the two lineages.table  <dig> summary of mismatch distribution parameters and neutrality test for two lineages of hippuris vulgaris

present and past  distribution of lineages
for lineages a and b, the auc values for the enm were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that model prediction performed well. the predicted distribution of lineage a under the current conditions was similar to its actual distribution . at the lgm, the potential distribution of lineage a mainly occurred in lowland areas in northeast china, differing from the present . for lineage b, the potential range under the current conditions was generally similar to its actual distribution . the predicted distribution at the lgm differed greatly on the qtp, retreating entirely from the platform to the northeast edge and southeast edge .fig.  <dig> potential distributions as probability of occurrence for hippuris vulgaris in china mapped using arcgis. a potential distributions at the present for lineage a. b potential distributions at the last glacial maximum  for lineage a. c potential distributions at the present for lineage b. d potential distributions at the lgm for lineage b



discussion
both cpdna and nssr results show that h. vulgaris in china is composed of two distinct lineages a and b with different geographic distributions. the distribution ranges of three other species in the genus hippuris are to the north of 53° north latitude, which are in the north of the range of h. vulgaris  <cit> . in addition, the fossil records of h. vulgaris, e.g., one of plio-pleistocene age from north greenland  <cit>  and another of middle and upper pleistocene from central england  <cit> , were also found in the north area of its present distribution. both species distribution and fossil record suggested that the ancestral range of h. vulgaris was in the north of its present range and probably to the north of 53° north latitude. therefore, lineages a and b had likely split in high latitudes before they migrated into china. the occurrence of different infra-specific lineages in high latitudes of asia has been revealed in some arctic-alpine plants  <cit> . our molecular dating indicates that the divergence of lineages a and b occurred during the early pleistocene , a period displaying minor glacial/interglacial variability before the mid-pleistocene revolution followed with higher-amplitude fluctuations  <cit> , suggesting that the latitudinal range shifts during the early pleistocene may not have been sufficient to push h. vulgaris southwards into china. the mid-pleistocene stem ages of lineage a and lineage b  also suggest that the two lineages migrated into china driven by the mid-pleistocene glaciations and thereafter diversified separately. this scenario needs to be tested by further studies including samples from high latitudes of asia.

lineage a is restricted to northeast china, indicating its immigration southwards into this region. the stem age of lineage a in the mid-pleistocene  and the occurrence of its potential distribution in the lowland areas of northeast china at the lgm  suggest that long-standing populations have persisted in northeast china for several glacial/interglacial cycles. for lineage b, the migration route is more complex. because the development of a wide arid belt or dryland in northern china and the republic of mongolia since ca.  <dig>  ma  <cit>  probably acted as a strong physical barrier for aquatic plant dispersal between northeast china and northwest china, lineage b should immigrate into china either from northeast china or from northwest china. direct dispersal between the two regions was unlikely, therefore, lineage b reached its present distribution by dispersal either from northeast china via the qtp to northwest china or via the reverse route. the former route seems likely because nne china had the largest number of haplotypes , whereas the latter route is supported by the fact that only subcluster i was found in nne china . combined with the exclusive occupation of the north range of northeast china by lineage a  and the occurrence of inter-lineage hybrids only in northeast china , we considered it more likely that lineage b immigrated southwards into northwest china, dispersed to the qtp and subsequently migrated into nne china .

the dispersal between highlands in northwest china and the qtp via the “central asiatic highland corridor” pathway has been suggested  <cit>  for the migration of the flora between the qtp and the arctic regions. this dispersal pathway was also suggested by wen et al.  <cit>  and verified through the results of a few recent phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies: the same or closely related lineages were present in the two regions . as for h. vulgaris, its dispersal between northwest china and the qtp was supported by a shared cpdna haplotype  and the same genetic subcluster ii  present in the two regions. this colonization was also in accordance with the migratory route of waterbirds in china  <cit> , which is an important vector for long-distance dispersal of aquatic plants  <cit> . furthermore, the fact that h. vulgaris is common in the diet of waterbirds at northern latitudes  <cit>  indicates the possibility of long-distance dispersal by waterbirds in h. vulgaris. the dispersal between the qtp and northeast china likely occurred through the “himalayan-hengduan mountain-qinling-northeast china” route suggested by wang  <cit> , based on the geographic distribution of some plants. however, for h. vulgaris, another route between northeast qtp edge and northeast china seems more likely because the populations from northeast qtp edge were assigned to genetic subcluster i, the same subcluster as populations from nne china . this route is consistent with the dispersal pathway of a subspecies of sea buckthorn  <cit> .

the qtp has biogeographic significance for alpine plant evolution  <cit> . based on evidence from phylogenetic studies on several taxa, wen et al.  <cit>  suggested a pattern of central asian origin with subsequent diversification on the qtp. this pattern is suitable for lineage b of h. vulgaris. the stem age of lineage b in the mid-pleistocene  is similar to the result of chen et al.  <cit>  , estimated based on another cpdna dataset collected from samples on the qtp, suggesting that h. vulgaris reached the qtp during the mid-pleistocene. two lineages were revealed on the qtp in chen et al.  <cit> , whereas no cpdna lineage divergence except three private haplotypes was detected in the present study , likely resulting from the use of different fragments. when nssr data were considered, three subclusters were identified on the qtp: subcluster i in northeast edge, subcluster ii from west to east, and subcluster iii from middle to east . chen et al. found that two cpdna lineages was overlapped distribution and co-occurred in some populations due to repeated range expansions  <cit> . this conclusion is confirmed by our nssr data because the same pattern was also revealed in our populations of subclusters ii and iii  and the sampling of chen et al.  <cit>  did not cover northeast qtp edge. in addition, we tried to use enm to infer potential glacial refugia of h. vulgaris based on bioclim variables. the distributions of aquatic plants species are correlated with climatic factors  and occurrences of different genetic lineages are associated with environmental dissimilarity or latitudinal difference in some widespread species  <cit> , indicating that eco-climatological niche modeling based on bioclim variables is applicable for aquatic plants. based on the prediction of enm, a marked range shift occurred in h. vulgaris at the lgm, retreating from the platform to the northeast edge and southeast edge . this scenario and the locations of potential glacial refugia have been suggested by many phylogeographic studies on the qtp  <cit> . the lineage divergence of h. vulgaris on the qtp was likely promoted by repeated climatic oscillations during mid-late pleistocene.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals that hippuris vulgaris is highly structured genetically and geographically in china, with signs of immigration, dispersal, diversification and hybridization. this study provides empirical evidence that boreal plants display complex evolutionary history in their southern range in asia. comparative studies on other boreal and arctic-alpine plants would be valuable for better understanding the colonization and diversification in their southern range in asia.
