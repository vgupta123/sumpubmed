BACKGROUND
rett syndrome  is a severe neurological disorder caused by mutations in the x-linked methyl-cpg binding protein  <dig>  gene  <cit> . female patients are affected with an incidence of 1/ <dig> live births  <cit>  and develop normally from birth to 6- <dig> months of age before the onset of deficits in autonomic, cognitive, motor functions and autistic features  <cit> . several studies shed light on the involvement of catecholaminergic and serotonergic disturbances as a major contributor of the disease in rtt patients and mecp <dig> mouse models. neurochemical analyses of biogenic amines in mecp2-null male  were previously performed on whole brain homogenates showing that the concentration of dopamine , norepinephrine  and serotonin  was reduced after birth  <cit> . moreover, the absence of mecp <dig> impairs several functions that are regulated by bioaminergic nuclei or peripheral ganglia where such neurochemical deficits occur  <cit> . however, these studies are discordant for several parameters. here, we evaluated the level of da, ne and 5-ht and their catabolites homovanillic acid , dihydroxyphenylacetic acid  and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid , using high performance liquid chromatography, combined with electrochemical detection . we performed our analyses on micropunched brain samples from the cortex, caudate-putamen, hypothalamus, midbrain  and the hindbrain   of mecp2-/y mice and their respective age-matched wild-type  littermates from postnatal day  <dig>  and  <dig> .

RESULTS
neither catecholamines nor serotonin levels are affected in the cortex of mecp2-/y
neurochemical analysis performed in the cortex showed no perturbation at p <dig> for da, ne and 5-ht levels in mecp2-/y compared to their wt littermates . no significant alterations were observed at p <dig> for da, ne and 5-ht . da measurements in the cortex display great variability possibly masking differences between the two genotypes . dopaminergic catabolites hva and dopac were unaffected at p <dig> and p <dig> . the serotonin metabolite 5-hiaa is not different between mecp2-/y and wt at p <dig> and p <dig>  . altogether, these results argue for a preserved biogenic amines metabolism in the cortex of mecp2-null mice.

the alteration of norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the hypothalamus of mecp2-/y is postnatal and biphasic
next, we measured biogenic amines concentrations in the hypothalamus. it was previously reported that a targeted deletion of mecp <dig> in single-minded  <dig> gene -expressing neurons  results in a body of behavioural deficits ranging from feeding disturbances to stress  <cit> . increased levels of corticosterone and leptin together with brain-derived neurotrophic factor  deficits are possible contributors for this phenotype in this mouse. since catecholamines play a role in hypothalamic nuclei neurotransmission and interplays with leptin and bdnf  <cit>  we wanted to assess deficits in bioamines and their degradation products. deficits were observed at p <dig> for ne and 5-ht . no alteration of da levels was noticed at this age . however, the ne and 5-ht decrease identified at p <dig> was no longer present at p <dig> and da levels were normal at p <dig>  . all the tested catabolites were found to be normal in the hypothalamus of mecp2-/y compared to wt at p <dig> and p <dig> .

bioaminergic disturbances are global and progressive in pontic and brainstem area of mecp2-/y
da, ne and 5-ht contents were evaluated by hplc using pons and brainstem samples of mecp2-/y animals and wt animals at p <dig> and p <dig> . da is reduced both at p <dig> and at p <dig> . ne levels are normal at p <dig>  but are clearly reduced at p <dig> . for serotonin, we found the same pattern of alteration, with no decrease at p <dig>  but a decrease at p <dig> . altogether, our results suggest that mecp2-/y mice have lower levels of biogenic amines than their wt littermates.

we respectively assessed the level of hva, dopac and 5-hiaa in these samples . at p <dig>  the only catabolite affected is hva  whereas dopac and 5-hiaa are normal . at p <dig>  the levels of hva, dopac and 5-hiaa were all reduced in mecp2-/y compared to wt samples .

mecp2-/y nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficits do not parallel noradrenergic or serotonergic ones
we previously reported a postnatal reduction of da and hva but not dopac in the caudate-putamen of mecp2-/y at p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit>  . here, we observed that at p <dig>  neither ne nor 5-ht contents were affected . this observation stands true for these neurotransmitters at p <dig> . we measured the level of 5-hiaa and found no alteration at p <dig> , and p <dig> . these results indicate that the noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters are unaffected in the caudate-putamen of mecp2-/y compared to their wt littermates at all ages investigated .

our previous work failed to detect changes in the level of da and dopac in the mecp2-/y midbrain at both p <dig> and p <dig>  however, we observed a clear reduction of hva in these dopaminergic neurons at the most advanced age  <cit>  . we extended our analysis to ne, 5ht and 5-hiaa at both ages. our results show that ne is not altered at p <dig> in mecp2-deficient midbrain . 5-ht levels are also preserved compared to wt level at the same age . samples obtained from symptomatic mice  do no exhibit any modification of the substrate levels compared to age-matched wt  . 5-hiaa values are normal at p <dig>  and at p <dig>  in mecp2-/y samples compared to age-matched wt .

discussion
mecp2-/y cortical neurons exhibit several alterations, ranging from reduced activity to abnormal dendritic spine morphology  <cit> . these defects are influenced by bdnf dosage  <cit> . bdnf plays a key role in neuronal survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . bdnf metabolism was shown to be involved in the development and function of catecholaminergic neurons, affected in mecp2-/y  <cit> . recently, several studies identified ne reductions in the piriform cortex of mecp2-null mouse at p <dig>  <cit>  and in the prefrontal and motor cortex at both  <dig>  and  <dig>  weeks of age  <cit> . we were not able to reproduce these findings. one possible explanation for this divergence could be differences in the sampling procedure. we performed micropunches of the motor cortex. different cortical territories receive monoaminergic inputs from different nuclei, some areas being less densely innervated than others  <cit> . serotonergic dosage in mecp2-/y brains were also reported and discrepancies are existing. isoda and collaborators did not to identify any modifications of 5-ht and its main catabolite 5-hiaa in the prefrontal cortex from p <dig> to p <dig>  <cit> . however, another laboratory argued for a reduction in the same structure of 5-ht only, at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks of age  <cit> . as isoda and coauthors measured, we did not found significant reductions of 5-ht or 5-hiaa. another group reported a 5-ht deficit in whole brain extracts in the same developmental window  <cit> . unfortunately, samples used in this study came from pooled  <dig> to  <dig> weeks mecp2-/y animals, two ages that are know to be phenotypically different according to the postnatal development of the mecp2-/y mouse pathology  <cit> . these results thus combine 5-ht contents from both mildly and severely affected animals.

it is generally believed that catecholamines play a role in hypothalamic nuclei neurotransmission and that their release is modulated by several factors including bdnf and leptin  <cit> . here, we report a postnatal alteration of hypothalamic ne and 5-ht contents that follows a biphasic scheme. these biogenic amines were found significantly decreased at p <dig> in mecp2-/y animals whereas their levels are not significantly different from wt at p <dig>  a recent study showed that specific deletion of mecp <dig> in sim1-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus  of the hypothalamus results in higher serum level of leptin  <cit> . since leptin was proposed to lower ne-dependant oxytocin release in the pvn  <cit>  and to reduce firing of serotonergic neurons  <cit>  it was tempting to assess the level of bioamines in this brain area. our results at p <dig> could reflect a leptin-dependant bioaminergic reduction. however, fyffe and coauthors did not identify alterations at  <dig> weeks  but noticed a significant increase  <dig> weeks. it is important to stress that mecp2-deletion is not restricted to hypothalamic neurons in the model we used. moreover, mice used in one study were of mixed 129/fvb genetic background  <cit>  while we used c57bl <dig> mecp2-/y mice  <cit> .

in agreement with taneja and co-workers  <cit> , we found a reduction of da and hva in our hindbrain samples containing both the brainstem and the pons at p <dig>  however, we did not found dopac reduction. taneja et al. used a different mecp2-/y strain . it would be interesting to investigate possible difference in the activity/modulation of da degradation enzymes in these two models. in the bird mouse  <cit>  no difference was found in monoamine oxydase  activity in the cortex  <cit> . it remains to be determined if mao and/or catechol-o-methyl transferase  levels are impaired elsewhere. interestingly, the caudal structures are the most affected with dopaminergic disturbances at p <dig> when the mecp <dig> animals display a mild phenotype, and a global monoaminergic deficit at p <dig> affecting da, ne, 5-ht and their degradation products. this is in good agreement with several studies arguing for a brainstem and pontic basis for the mecp2-/y phenotype and rtt symptoms in humans  <cit> . the observed increase in the serotonergic ratio  at p <dig> in the pons and brainstem supports a possible alteration of 5-ht projections innervating this structure and modulating the autonomic functions altered in the absence of mecp <dig>  <cit> .

shown are mean values +/- s.e.m. for the ratios of dopaminergic metabolites hva + dopac/da and serotonergic metabolite 5-hiaa/5-ht in the cortex , the hypothalamus , the caudate-putamen , midbrain  and brainstem + pons  of mecp2-/y and their wt littermates at p <dig> and p <dig>  dopamine turnover was unafected in the cx, hyp, cpu, md and bp at both p <dig> and p <dig> in mecp2-/y compared to their age-matched wt littermates. serotonergic turnover was not modified in cx and md at any age investigated. however, hyp and cpu dosage revealed a significant increase of 5-hiaa/5-ht ratio at p <dig> but not p <dig>  in turn, values from the bp indicate a clear increase in the serotonergic turnover in mecp2-/y when they exhibit the most severe phenotype . .

mecp2-/y mice display a progressive and postnatal alteration in their motor behavior  <cit> . interestingly, mice with a targeted deletion of mecp <dig> in th-expressing neurons show a deficit in motricity among other dysregulations  <cit> . we recently described in mice harboring a constitutive deletion of mecp <dig> progressive alterations of the snpc and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, a key component of the brain motor circuitry  <cit> . moreover, some of the behaviors impaired were ameliorated by l-dopa, arguing for a strong, although clearly non-unique, involvement of the da disturbances in mecp2-/y motor phenotype. in complement to this previous study, we here pursued our neurochemical investigations for ne and 5-ht in the snpc and its striatal target. ne, provided from the locus coeruleus, a <dig> and a <dig>  is implicated in several brain functions and its action on midbrain da neurons was shown to modulate motivational behaviors  <cit> . the absence of ne and 5-ht disturbances in the midbrain and the caudate-putamen confirm previous findings  <cit> .

the consequence of mecp2-deficiency on the integrity of dopaminergic and serotonergic nuclei could be indexed on the hva + dopac/da and 5-hiaa/5-ht ratios respectively since a toxic alteration of dopaminergic and serotonergic systems induces counteradaptative processes that impact on this values  <cit> . the calculated ratios are reported in table  <dig>  results suggest dopamine turnover was left unaffected in all the structures investigated at both p <dig> and p <dig> in mecp2-/y compared to their wt littermates. conversely, hypothalamus and caudate-putamen dosage revealed a significant increase of 5-hiaa/5-ht ratio at p <dig> but not p <dig>  values from the pons and brainstem indicate a clear increase in the serotonergic turnover in mecp2-/y at p <dig>  however, this index was not modified in the cortex and the midbrain at p <dig> and p <dig>  alteration of the serotonergic innervation lead to an increase in the turnover  <cit> . interestingly, a reduction in 5-ht immunoreactive fibers was reported in the hippocampus of mecp2-/y animals  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated if such phenomenon contribute to serotonergic deficits described here.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the level of catecholamines and serotonin is differentially affected in mecp2-/y brain areas in a time-dependent fashion . considering behavioral and physiological function altered in the context of mecp2-deficiency and the positive impact of drugs targeting this system, monoamine neurochemical dosage could help identifying therapeutics resetting central bioaminergic deficits in different brain areas of the mecp2-deficient mouse.
