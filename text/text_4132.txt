BACKGROUND
dopaminergic  neurons are an anatomically and functionally heterogeneous group of cells involved in a wide range of neuronal network activities and behavior
 <cit> . among them, mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons  are the major source of dopamine in the brain. they present two major groups of projecting cells: the a <dig> neurons of the substantia nigra  that form the mesostriatal system and the a <dig> cells of the ventral tegmental area  that constitute the mesocorticolimbic pathway
 <cit> . sn neurons are involved in regulating voluntary movements and postural reflexes while vta cells play a fundamental role in reward and attention.

dysfunction of da neurons has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. selective degeneration of a <dig> cells leads to parkinson’s disease 
 <cit> , while altered function of a <dig> cells has been linked to schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder and addiction
 <cit> .

these cells share many characteristics including the enzymatic pathways involved in dopamine synthesis, release and metabolism. they also present common intrinsic electrophysiological properties like a spontaneous pacemaker activity when in absence of synaptic inputs.

the description of the repertoire of genes expressed in mda neurons may provide crucial information on their physiology and on the mechanisms of cell-type specific dysfunction
.

cap analysis of gene expression  technology was previously developed for the systematic analysis of transcription start sites s in eukaryotic cells and tissues
 <cit> . it is based on sequencing cdna copies of the 5′ends of mrnas, of which the integrity is inferred by the presence of their cap. these sequences—referred to as tags—are sufficiently long to be aligned in most cases at a single location in the genome. the first position of this alignment identifies a base pair where transcription is initiated defining a tss. the number of times a given tag is represented in a library gives an estimate of the expression level of the corresponding transcript. our previous analysis with cage has shown that promoters can vary in shape, with some genes having a strong preference for initiating transcription from a single genomic position , while others use a broad collection of tsss within a region of approximately one hundred bases
 <cit> .

in the current fantom <dig> project, a modified protocol of cage for high-throughput single molecule next-generation sequencing with helicos  has been applied to a wide range of human and mouse tissues providing an unprecedented dataset for promoter usage analysis
 <cit> . although very broad, the study was limited to samples where 1- <dig> μg of total rna could be obtained. to expand this analysis to tiny amounts of ex vivo tissue and to the polya- fraction of rnas, we developed nanocage, a technology that miniaturizes the requirement of cage for rna material to the nanogram range and which can be used on fixed tissues
 <cit> .

nanocage has been recently applied to identify the genome-wide collection of active tsss of the mouse olfactory epithelium 
 <cit> . in this tissue the detection of a vast repertoire of volatile compounds  is accomplished by a large family of olfactory receptors , with more than  <dig> intact genes in mouse and about  <dig> in human. nanocage revealed the map and architecture of promoters for  <dig> % of the mouse or genes
 <cit> .

to gain further insights into the physiology and dysfunction of mda neurons, we have carried out laser capture microdissection  combined with nanocage technology to profile the genes expressed in a <dig> and a <dig> da cells.

here we show that a repertoire of or genes is expressed in mda neurons . we then demonstrate that selected odor molecules stimulate recombinantly expressed mda-ors in heterologous cells and trigger ca2+ signaling in isolated primary mda neurons. finally, we identify several ors that are expressed in the human sn and down-regulated in pd.

this work is part of the fantom <dig> project. data downloads, genomic tools and co-published manuscripts are summarized here: http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/.

RESULTS
identification of ors transcripts by expression analysis of mda neurons
we have determined the gene expression profiles of mda neurons with nanocage technology. to this purpose we took advantage of transgenic mice that selectively express green fluorescent protein  in catecholaminergic cells under the control of tyrosine hydroxylase  gene promoter 
 <cit> . in this mouse line we can identify the majority of mda neurons for their gfp labeling. furthermore, we can distinguish a <dig> neurons from a <dig> for their anatomical localization. thus, lcm and pressure catapulting were used to harvest a <dig> and a <dig> cells after fixation with a zinc fix-based method that assured the preservation of both tissue morphology and rna integrity. rna was then used as template for nanocage library synthesis. the complete description of a <dig> and a10-specific transcriptional landscape is presented elsewhere .

these results have been integrated with affymetrix-based gene expression datasets of a <dig> and a <dig> cells available in the laboratory
 <cit> .

surprisingly, transcripts for or genes have been found expressed in mda neurons . nine ors were validated with rt-pcr from ventral midbrain  with the appropriate controls . cloning and sequencing of pcr products verified their identity.figure  <dig> 
nanocage analyses unveil atypical expression of or genes. a) validation of or gene expression in mouse midbrain. mb was dissected from c57bl/ <dig> mouse and total rna extracted and used for non-quantitative pcr. primers were designed to specifically amplify selected ors, as shown. rna from oe was included as a positive control. non-retrotranscribed  rna was used as a negative control. arrows indicate or specific bands. data are representative of n =  <dig> replicas from independent tissue preparations. b) representative tracks of nanocage sequencing data of libraries from a <dig> and a <dig> mda neurons. data from oe  are included for comparison. genomic coordinates are shown on top and expression values  on the right. positive and negative tpm values indicate transcription on plus and minus dna filament, respectively. black arrows in each track highlight tss. at the bottom, annotated refseq is shown in grey and thick arrowheads indicate direction of transcription.



 <dig> out of  <dig> ors identified by nanocage and validated by rt-pcr display in mda neurons a tss very similar if not identical to the canonical tss found in oe  <cit>  . or promoters in mda cells were of a sharp type, with a single dominant tss, as in the oe. expression values, measured as number of tags per million , ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

since in the oe the functional activation of ors requires gαolf and adenyl cyclase iii , we monitored their expression in our datasets showing that both signaling molecules were present in a <dig> and a <dig> mda neurons . their expression was also detected in fantom <dig> libraries derived from mouse sn .

altogether our results indicate that or genes as well as components of the olfactory signaling system are expressed in mda neurons.

validation of mda-or expression in mda cells and mouse brain
rt-pcr and in situ hybridization experiments were then carried out to assess mda-ors’ cellular distribution.  <dig> a <dig> and a <dig> da neurons were harvested with lcm in three independent experiments. as shown in figure 
2a, expression of seven ors was confirmed in isolated neurons. olfr <dig>  olfr <dig>  olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> were found exclusively in a <dig> cells, whereas olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> were present both in a <dig> and in a <dig>  for in situ hybridization  sense  and antisense riboprobes were generated for olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> and used in a double fluorescent experiment with anti-th immunoreactivity to identify da cells
 <cit>  . no or low background staining was measured when sense probes were used . olfr <dig> was present exclusively in a <dig> neurons, decorating a portion of th-positive cells in this area. olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> were expressed in the large majority of a <dig> and a <dig> neurons. altogether, ish experiments confirmed rt-pcr data on isolated mda cells.figure  <dig> 
mda-ors are expressed in mda neurons and in mouse brain. a) or genes are expressed in a <dig> and a <dig> da neurons.  <dig> da cells were harvested by lcm. equal numbers of non-da cells were collected from the same brain region. oe was also included. non-quantitative pcr was performed with specific primers. results are representative of n =  <dig> independent harvesting. b)
in situ hybridization of selected mda-ors in mouse da neurons. ventral midbrain slices were processed with olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> specific probes . da neurons were visualized by immunohistochemistry with anti-th antibody . nuclei are in blue . representative images of staining in a <dig> and a <dig> neurons are shown . scale bars indicate 20 μm.



we then took advantage of an antibody targeting human or51e <dig> that we predicted should recognize a group of mouse olfrs including olfr <dig>  the mouse homologue of or51e <dig>  first, we showed that this antibody was able to specifically stain olfr558-expressing cells upon full-length cdna transfection in hek cells . we then carried out immunostaining on brain sections, showing that it was decorating all a <dig> and a <dig> neurons, plus non-da cells in the same region as well in the cortex . this result proved that or proteins were present in mb. no signal was detected when only the secondary antibody was used .

overall these data indicate that a subset of ors is expressed in mda neurons with an a9/a <dig> anatomical distribution that is specific for each receptor.

mda-ors are expressed in mouse tissues and cells
to assess how widespread is the expression of mda-ors  we examined their expression patterns in the fantom <dig> collection of hcage mouse libraries . we monitored mda-or expression assessing tag counts across the whole locus of interest . expression data was represented as tag per million . we used the decomposition-based peak identification  method to identify peaks in cage profiles, taking advantage of the deepness of sequencing and the high number of libraries
 <cit> . tss mapped at almost identical positions confirming the reference sequence annotation . we detected expression of olfr <dig> in bone, heart, placenta and hippocampus . olfr <dig> was expressed in non-neuronal tissues such as bone  and stomach  as well as in neuronal tissues such as cerebellum , striatum , cortex , medulla oblongata  and spinal cord . olfr <dig> was present in spinal cord , medulla oblongata , cortex  and cerebellum  . no expression was detected in liver, lung, thymus, intestine and testis for any of the mda-ors analyzed.figure  <dig> 
expression of mouse mda-ors in tissues and primary cells. a) zenbu browser view of olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> tss in pooled mouse tissues. genomic coordinates are shown on top and scale of expression values  on the left. positive and negative tpm values indicate transcription on plus and minus dna filament, respectively. black arrows in each track highlight tss. at the bottom, thick arrowheads indicate direction of transcription. b) fantom <dig> analysis of mda-or expression in mouse tissues and various brain regions. c) qrt-pcr of or transcripts expressed in various brain regions. normalized mrna levels  of olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> in mouse tissues. hippocampus was used as reference and set to  <dig>  oe, olfactory epithelium; mb, ventral midbrain; ctx, cortex; ob, olfactory bulb; cb, cerebellum; hc, hippocampus. data indicate mean ± st dev and are calculated on three independent experiments.



to validate the expression of olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> an olfr <dig>  we dissected several brain regions of adult c57bl/ <dig> mice and carried out qrt-pcr. oe was included as positive control, while liver was representative of a tissue outside of the central nervous system. all three mda-ors showed a distinct pattern in the brain . liver scored as negative for all three receptors. olfr <dig> was strongly enriched in mb as compared to the other regions, while olfr <dig> transcript was highest in the hippocampus. olfr <dig> was the only or with the highest expression in oe.

recombinant mda-ors are activated by a subset of odors
to investigate the function of mda-ors in da cells’ physiology, we first sought to identify potential agonists for each receptor. full-length mda-ors were cloned from the ventral midbrain for olfr <dig>  olfr <dig>  olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> in frame with a rho-tag sequence at the n-terminus. cdnas for the same receptors were also cloned from oe and no sequence differences were observed. transient transfections in non-neuronal hek  <dig> and in dopaminergic imn9d cells indicated that olfr <dig>  olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> cloned from mb drove the expression of a protein with the expected molecular weight  and whose localization was mainly at the plasma membrane . lower expression was achieved for olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> which synthesis was at detection limits of western blot analysis but visible by immunofluorescence. the well-characterized s <dig> or was used in all experiments as positive control.

for functional assays we transiently expressed mda-ors in heterologous hek  <dig> cells in combination with cre-seap reporter plasmid and determined ligand specificity by measuring seap quantity in the culture medium in response to odors. sixteen odor molecules were used for ligand screening including standard odors used for ors de-orphanization 
 <cit>  as well as putative ligands proposed on the basis of sequence similarity between the ors present in the olfactiondb  and queried mda-ors plus chemical ligands identified by chemoinformatic approaches .

olfr <dig> was the only receptor showing a robust, reproducible response to selected odor-like molecules . the strongest responses were elicited by s- and r-carvones as well as decanoic acid.

active odors were then used at increasing concentrations proving their function as agonists at μm levels . their specificity was measured in cells transfected with an empty control vector .figure  <dig> 
selected odors activate mda-ors expressed in heterologous cells as well as primary mda neurons. a)
olfr <dig> was transiently transfected in hek cells in combination with pcre-seap. after transfection, cells were pulsed with the indicated odor molecules at 600 μm concentration. dmso was used as negative control . mda-or activation was measured with fluorimetric assay on culture medium. odor response was calculated as fold-increase relative to control value. data indicate mean ± st dev and are calculated on n =  <dig> independent experiments. b) cells were transfected as in a) and pulsed with increasing concentrations of r-carvone, s-carvone, menthone and decanoic acid. ringer’s solution or dmso was used as control . mda-or activation was calculated as in a). data indicate mean ± st dev and are calculated on at least three independent experiments. *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> . c) ca2+ dynamics in primary da neurons dissociated from the ventral midbrain of th-gfp mouse. normalized fluorescence ratio changes  were measured in da neurons loaded with fura-2 am and challenged with bath-applied odor mixture composed by  <dig> odorants at 200 μm each . images are presented in pseudocolour scale, as indicated. gfp fluorescence of da neurons is shown. scale bars indicate 10 μm. d) experiment as in c). primary neurons were stimulated with - and -carvone mixture at 600 μm each.



isolated primary mda neurons respond to odor molecules
to assess the physiological response of da cells to odor-like agonists at mda-ors, we used ratiometric ca2+ dynamics evoked by odor stimulation on isolated neurons. primary mda neurons were prepared from th-gfp mice upon enzymatic digestion and mechanical trituration of mb. isolated neurons were loaded with the ca2+ indicator fura-2 am and then were challenged with odor mixture  or a mix of carvone enantiomers . about one-third of da neurons used for the analysis showed ca2+ responsiveness upon odor stimulation. in particular,  <dig> % were activated by odor mixture  and 31%  by carvones. pulse with odors typically induced a fast onset of the ca2+ signal that lasted 1–2 min . importantly, after odor washout, da cells showed normal ca2+ transients to high k+ solution, indicating that the general excitability and downstream ca2+ entry were intact .

a subset of human ors is expressed in sn and regulated in pd post mortembrains
we then aimed to identify ors in human sn. to this purpose we used two unbiased approaches. first, we took advantage of the large fantom <dig> collection of deep-sequencing datasets
 <cit> . these include four libraries from sn derived from post mortem tissues of three human adults and one neonate . to obtain the coordinates of putative promoters for human ors, we selected windows of 200 bp centered on transcription start sites of mouse or genes
 <cit>  and “lifted” their coordinates over the most recent version of annotated human genome
 <cit> . this analysis pulled out  <dig> putative coordinates in the human genome for which transcription was evident in any of the sn libraries. we then manually verified each genomic position.  <dig> of them turned out to be artifacts, as not corresponding to any human or gene locus . the remaining  <dig> coordinates identified bona fide putative human or tss , with two of them falling in the same or locus . main tss could be found at the exact positions of annotated refseq , further upstream, between -500 bp and -2000 bp , in the intragenic region  or at the 3′-end . for two of them, the position was far upstream  of the annotated gene and thus not further investigated .figure  <dig>

post mortem
brains. a) fantom <dig> cage data in human sn samples. heat map graphical representation of human ors expression in adult and neonate samples, as indicated. list of human ors identified by genomic approach  and by homology search . b) complete open reading frame for human or2l <dig> was cloned from rna extracted from sn of two individuals , not affected by neurodegenerative disorders . c) proteins were extracted from post mortem material. western blot analysis was performed with anti-or51e <dig> antibody. protein extract from sh-sy5y cells was included as negative control. β-actin was used as loading control. images are representative of n =  <dig> independent experiment with n =  <dig> independent sn samples. d) zenbu genome browser view of cage signals for or2l <dig> and or51e <dig> in human sn. genomic coordinates are shown on top and scale of expression values  on the left. black arrows in each track highlight transcription start sites . at the bottom, thick arrowheads indicate direction of transcription. e) qrt-pcr validation of human mda-ors expression in human tissues. a panel of human rnas from various tissues was used to validate atypical expression of or2l <dig> and or51e <dig>  brain was arbitrarily set as  <dig>  f) qrt-pcr of sn from control and pd post mortem brain samples. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> .



as a second approach, we applied sequence similarity comparison with mouse mda-or. to this purpose we performed a multiple sequence alignment between human ors present in the olfactiondb, for which functional validation exists, and the validated mouse mda-ors. based on this alignment, a maximum-parsimony phylogenetic tree was then built . we found that highest similarities could be measured between olfr <dig> and human or51e <dig> , olfr <dig> and or2l <dig> , olfr <dig> and or10ad <dig>  and olfr <dig> and or2ak <dig> .

we then took advantage of fantom <dig> data for human sn to monitor expression of candidate human or genes using tag counts across the whole locus of interest . we thus found evidence of transcription for most of the selected human ors with tpm values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . negative counts were present for those ors for which tss coordinates were poorly found  and those with weaker homology . or2l <dig> was the top expressed or. or51e <dig>  identified by both approaches, could also be found in human sn, although at lower level. we then validated their expression by successfully cloning or2l <dig> cdnas from sn rna  and by detecting two bands of the expected molecular weight by using an anti-or51e <dig> antibody on human sn extracts .

interrogation of the global fantom <dig> human promoter expression atlas  showed that the repertoire of or identified in the sn has a complex pattern of expression . liver is the only organ where none of the analyzed or is expressed. or2l <dig> was strongly enriched in the brain, while or51e <dig> was highly expressed in prostate. their tss usage is shown in figure 
5d. qrt-pcr analysis of human tissues validated these findings .

for functional assay, or2l <dig> was then transiently expressed in heterologous hek  <dig> cells in combination with cre-seap reporter plasmid to monitor seap quantity in response of odor stimulation. membrane localization and size of the ectopically expressed protein were monitored by immunocytochemistry and western blot . statistically significant responses were elicited by carvone enantiomers and eugenol although at detection limits .

given their expression at the site of neurodegeneration, we monitored or transcripts in sn from  <dig> pd and  <dig> control post mortem brains. or2l <dig> and or51e <dig> expression were analyzed together with a subset of ors that were previously demonstrated to be down-regulated in the cortex of pd patients
 <cit> . to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, we set up taqman assays for each or gene transcript. first, we could measure the expression of this panel of ors in the sn of several individuals , further implementing the repertoire of or transcripts in this brain region . then, we found that or gene expression is down-regulated in the sn of pd patients, as recently reported for the cortex
 <cit> , with the only exception of or51e <dig>  whose decrease is not significant. down-regulation of human ors in pd patients cannot be solely due to neuronal cell loss since in the same samples we could detect either unchanged or up-regulated levels of some taste receptors 
 <cit>  that were found expressed in the sn .

altogether, our results highlight the expression of a repertoire of or genes in human sn and their dysregulation in pd.

discussion
in the main oe the detection of a vast repertoire of volatile compounds  is accomplished by a large family of ors on the surface of the cilia of osns. odorants binding to ors activate g proteins and initiate downstream signaling that leads to ca2+ influx and ultimately to the perception of smell.

each mature osn in the oe is thought to express only one allele of a single or gene—monoallelic and monogenic expression, respectively. a given or gene is expressed in a mosaic or punctate pattern of osns within a characteristic zone of the oe. the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie this extraordinary restriction in gene expression remain unclear. to address this issue, by applying nanocage to mouse oe, we have previously associated tsss to  <dig> mouse or genes, thereby defining a comprehensive picture of their promoter map at a single-base resolution. in contrast with the archetype of the broad shape of >75% of mammalian promoters, or genes have sharp promoters exhibiting a dominant tss
 <cit> .

a distinctive feature in the topographic organization of the olfactory system is that ors also plays an instructive role in the axonal convergence of osn into the olfactory bulb . this function is supported by genetic experiments and by the expression of the or on the axon termini of the osn. or at the growth cone of osn are capable of binding odors and are coupled to camp synthesis and ca2+ influx through cyclic nucleotide gated  channels. this suggests a potential role of or activation in axonal convergence and sensory map formation
 <cit> .

interestingly, ors have been also found to reside in tissues other than those involved in olfaction
. several distinct ors are expressed predominantly or exclusively in spermatogenic cells, where they mediate sperm chemotaxis
 <cit> . selected ors accumulate in prostate cancer to inhibit proliferation
 <cit> . olfr <dig>  a well-characterized receptor in mouse, controls chemosensing and motility in sperm
 <cit>  as well as regeneration, cell adhesion and migration in muscle
 <cit> . single ors were found expressed in layer ii pyramidal neurons in the occipital lobe and tightly controlled during development, possibly contributing to axon guidance
 <cit> . more recently, by taking advantage of mrna-seq data of  <dig> human tissues available from illumina body map project  <dig> ,  <dig> or genes were shown expressed outside of oe. interestingly, or51e <dig> and or2w <dig> were expressed in all the tissues analyzed while others showed a more restricted pattern with several examples of expression in only one tissue
 <cit> . therefore, it is becoming evident that non-olfactory cells can hijack ors as a general signaling pathway to achieve other cell-specific functions.

here we show that multiple ors are expressed by mouse mda neurons, a cell system that is involved in movement control and reward behavior. interestingly, or gene expression is also present in other regions as well as outside of the mouse brain. global transcriptome analysis, cdna full-length cloning and quantitative rt-pcr indicate that or transcripts can be also found in human sn.

nanocage
 <cit>  is a next-generation sequencing technology for unbiased 5′-end transcriptome profiling and have provided measurement of the expression level of ors transcripts along with the precise definition of their tsss from purified mda cells. being a single-nucleotide resolution technology, it greatly differs in terms of quantitative and qualitative output from microarray platforms or from pcr screenings based on degenerated oligonucleotides. while the expression of a significant number of olfrs has been confirmed both with nanocage analysis of lcm-purified cells and rt-pcr from mb, some discrepancies have been noticed that may be explained as follows. first, a <dig> and particularly a <dig> da cell groups are highly heterogeneous. on the basis of morphology and connectivity  <dig> different a <dig> neuronal cell types have been described. the low associated tpm scores may thus be interpreted as rnas transcribed by a specific da subtype leading to expression under detection threshold in total mb analysis. this has been already shown by the comparison of the deepcage data with in situ hybridization for the hippocampus
 <cit>  and reported for ors in the gut, where they were expressed exclusively in gastrointestinal enterochromaffin cells, which constitute only a minor proportion of the total intestinal epithelium
 <cit> . importantly, nanocage data do not offer any description of the anatomy of the transcript. gisselmann and collegues
 <cit>  showed that human ors give raise to a plethora of transcripts with surprising features: unexpected internal introns, truncated or chimeric rnas with adjacent genes and 5′ ends derived from distant, previously undescribed tsss. while we have provided full-length cdnas of validated mda-ors cloned from mb, a detailed analysis of transcript anatomy for every single gene presenting nanocage tags will assess this important issue.

as in oe, validated mda-ors present sharp promoters in mda cells. most importantly, the very same tss is often used in both tissues. sharp promoters without cpg islands are often bound by tfs within a constrained spacing range. ors promoters are no exceptions showing positional preferences for specific motifs such as for mef2a, ebf1/hox and sox
 <cit> . this transcription factor binding site code can also be relevant for their transcriptional control in mda cells as well as in the brain. this may suggest that the promoter architecture of ors may be under evolutionary pressure to drive transcription both in oe and in other tissues strongly challenging the idea that or expression outside oe is “atypical” or “ectopic”.

deorphanization of ors is a very important task that has been attempted at different scales. while virtual high-throughput screening  has been successful to identify novel ligands
 <cit> , large efforts have been dedicated to the optimization of heterologous expression systems for efficient ectopic membrane localization of ors and detection of responses to odor-like molecules. among the most successful htss,  <dig> odorants have been tested on  <dig> ors expressed in heterologous cells identifying agonists for  <dig> mouse and  <dig> human ors
 <cit> .

in this study, the screening has been limited to  <dig> potential ligands and  <dig> ors cdnas. odor-like molecules have been chosen for representing the major chemical moieties and putative ligands proposed on the basis of sequence similarity between mda-ors and those present in the olfactiondb plus chemical ligands identified by chemoinformatic approaches.

while olfr <dig> was the only ors showing convincing responses, analysis of olfr <dig> and olfr <dig> were limited by their low expression at the cell membrane.

despite these limitations we have been able to identify the first odor-like molecule that act on mda cells. carvones are monocyclic monoterpene with antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticonvulsant, and antitumor activities. --carvone is the main constituent of spearmint oil  while --carvone is a major component of caraway and dill seed oils. we prove that they elicited a strong response in olfr <dig> expressed in the heterologous system and that they triggered ca2+ responsiveness in solitary mda neurons. a formal prove that mda neurons response is mediated by olfr <dig> requires further experiments that are beyond the scope of this work.

these results suggest a potential role of or activation in mda physiology. however, the identity of the endogenous ligands for mda-ors remains unknown.

a further optimization of heterologous expression of mda-ors and a largest repertory of odor-like molecules will probably lead to the discovery of additional agonists at mda cells and therefore to new molecular tools to manipulate mda subtypes’ activities.

this concept can be extended to any ors expressed outside the oe and to any expressing neuronal cell types. odor-like molecules may thus represent new opportunities for developing neuroactive drugs that act on a defined repertoire of cells. if coupled with radioisotopes, they might also serve as probes for in vivo imaging.

since in the oe the functional activation of ors requires gαolf and adcy <dig>  it is important that we detected the expression of these signaling molecules in mda neurons as well. many evidences position gαolf at a crucial crossroad of the dopaminergic system in health and disease
 <cit> . so far gαolf--mediated phenotypes have been interpreted for its ability to mediate dopamine receptor  <dig> signaling in striatal medium spiny neurons
 <cit> . according to our work, it will be also important to assess the contribution of signaling initiated at ors.

albeit limited by the small size of patients’ samples available for this study, we have shown that the large majority of human ors expressed in sn are down-regulated in pd post mortem brains. interestingly, in the same pd samples tasr are up-regulated, thus suggesting that or down-regulation is not entirely due to neuronal cells loss. for some of the ors expressed in human sn such as or51e <dig>  or2j <dig> and or51e <dig>  hts have led to the identification of potential agonists. it will be thus interesting assaying, respectively, nonanoic acid and butyl butyryllacetate, cys-3-hexen-1-ol and cynnamaldehyde as well as propionic acid for their activities on human da cells.

early-stage pd has been associated to a significant smell dysfunction in some monogenic forms as well as in sporadic pd cases, with a prevalence of approximately 90%
 <cit> . unlike cells in the sn, periglomerular da cells of the olfactory bulb do not degenerate but increase in number with a concomitant induction of th expression. the basis for olfactory dysfunction in pd is currently unknown. it remains to be determined whether ors down-regulation in sn has a role in the olfactory dysfunction observed in pd patients
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by nanocage transcriptome profiling we demonstrate that a subset of ors is expressed in isolated a <dig> and a <dig> mda neurons. in these cells, odor-like stimuli are able to evoke ca2+-signals. expression of ors is also detected in human sn, the site of neurodegeneration in pd, and is found regulated in pd post mortem brains.

ors might thus contribute to the normal physiology of mda neurons in mammals and potentially be target of pharmacological manipulation with odor-like molecules in disease.
