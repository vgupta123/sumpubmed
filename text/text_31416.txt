BACKGROUND
streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  is a gram-positive bacterium belonging to the lancefield group d streptococci. over the last ten years, the classification of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus has been revised several times  <cit> . s. bovis was previously divided into three biotypes, designated as biotype i, biotype ii/ <dig>  and biotype ii/ <dig>  the majority of isolates associated with human endocarditis have been assigned to biotype i, which was recently reclassified as streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  <cit> . furthermore, s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a common member of the microflora and appears in approximately  <dig>  to 15% of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy human  <cit> . it is an opportunistic human pathogen which can cause several bacterial infections, including septicemia and endocarditis. over the last few years, the percentage of cases of endocarditis caused by group d streptococci has significantly increased  <cit> . recently, russel et al. estimated that s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is the causative agent in 24% of streptococcal endocarditis cases  <cit> . in addition, several studies present strong correlations between appearance of colon neoplasms and s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infection  <cit> , while the underlying pathomechanisms are still unknown. sillanpää et al. suggest that premalignant and malignant lesions in the intestinal tract could facilitate translocation of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus through the disrupted mucosal barrier and provide access to blood circulation  <cit> . furthermore, studies have suggested a linkage between inflammation by s. bovis and colon carcinogenesis  <cit> . in addition, a variety of animal infections, such as mastitis, septicemia in poultry, lactic acidosis and infections of various ruminant animals are caused by s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  <cit> . however, the exact pathomechanisms of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus or s. bovis infections remain unclear.

s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus shares its environment with numerous other potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as s. agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis or others. this implies the possibility of horizontal gene transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes or genomic islands, e.g. phage-related clusters, by transposons, plasmids or phages, within the human gut or the animal rumen  <cit> . several studies have reported the occurrence of competence-stimulating peptides in s. bovis  <cit> . these factors facilitate the acquisition of novel genes, resistance islands or virulence-associated regions  <cit> , in particular when several species coexist within biofilms  <cit> . recently we were able to show the capability of biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces for s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  <cit> . nevertheless, most of the mechanisms of transfer and insertion are poorly understood  <cit> .

in vitro studies have demonstrated the adhesion and invasion of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus to extracellular matrix proteins  <cit> , virulence associated proteins  <cit> , as well as ea.hy <dig> or huvec cells  <cit> . furthermore, studies have addressed biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides  <cit>  and fimbriae-like structures on the bacterial surface in s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus has  <dig> cell wall-anchored proteins with "microbial surface component recognizing matrix molecules"  characteristics, including a collagen-binding adhesin and proteins with similarities to pilus subunits  <cit> .

recently, rusinok et al. published the first whole genome sequence of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain ucn <dig> and analyzed the main metabolic and cell surface features, particularly with regard to adaptation to the rumen and the virulence association of polysaccharide capsule, glucan mucopolysaccharides, different types of pili and collagen binding proteins  <cit> .

here we present the whole genome sequence of a not described, considerably divergent s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain. the strain under study was the tetracycline resistant strain atcc baa- <dig>  isolated from a patient with infectious endocarditis. we demonstrate the occurrence of a previously undescribed plasmid  which carries genes for tetracycline resistance ) and reveals strong sequence similarities to plasmids and chromosomes from several ruminal and gastrointestinal bacteria, indicating that psgg <dig> may act as a native carrier for horizontal gene transfer.

RESULTS
general genome properties
the whole genome sequence of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus was determined by pyrosequencing using the  <dig> gs flx titanium technique  and, after assembly of the  <dig> reads, remaining gaps were closed by pcr and conventional sanger sequencing. the genome contains a  <dig> , <dig> bp circular dna molecule with a g+c-content of  <dig> % and a previously undescribed  <dig>  bp plasmid designated as psgg <dig>  mapping of gene set was performed against s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genome ucn <dig>   <cit> . bioinformatic analysis predicted  <dig>  open reading frames , the presence of  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas in the chromosome, as well as  <dig> orfs on the plasmid psgg <dig> 

the size of the baa- <dig> circular chromosome  exceeds the average of other previously published streptococcal genomes by 12%  . direct comparison shows that only the s. sanguinis sk <dig> genome is larger , and the g+c-content is  <dig> % lower than average . altogether  <dig>  orfs were automatically annotated, which is 10% higher than the average of all complete sequenced streptococcus genomes . in direct comparison to the s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genome ucn <dig>  the baa- <dig> genome is  <dig>  kb larger , has  <dig> fewer cds  and contains the  <dig>  bp plasmid psgg <dig> 

the sequences and annotations of chromosome and plasmid have been deposited at the ncbi genbank .

comparative genomics
in a direct comparison of genome baa- <dig> to ucn <dig>  we noted various orfs and regions inserted or deleted scattered along the genomes; nonetheless the majority of genetic information is shared by both strains. the baa- <dig> genome contains  <dig>  orfs which are predicted to be common in baa- <dig> and ucn <dig>  the arrangement of genetic information is very similar overall, based on alignment of the genomes and the synteny plot . the comparison of the baa- <dig> genome with ucn <dig> showed about  <dig> kb  of unmatched genetic information. in the ucn <dig> genome,  <dig>  unique genes are present, the baa- <dig> genome contains  <dig>  unique or weak similar genes. there are numerous strain-specific regions with functional genes originated by genetic evolution or lateral gene transfer . due to the high number of genomic differences, we focused on genes and regions relating to putative virulence-associated functions or genes affected by habitant adaptation. all unique genes and corresponding islands calculated by edgar analysis are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig>  and additional file 3: table s <dig> 

comparison of whole chromosome sequences by mauve software  <cit>  reveals an alignment consisting of  <dig> local collinear blocs  . no significant inversions or displacements of large regions between the s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus genomes of baa- <dig> and ucn <dig> were obvious. regions with low similarity to the corresponding genome occur frequently and their distribution is almost random, although the region from base  <dig> , <dig> bp to the end of the genome seems to be more conserved.

virulence factors
the baa- <dig> genome contains a  <dig> kb unique insertion comprising  <dig> orfs , including the putative major cell surface adhesin pac. this gene is a major colonization factor in s. mutants  <cit>  and may play a similar role in baa- <dig>  in addition, it has a 84% similarity to a gene in ucn <dig> . almost identical to this region is another  <dig> kb large section in the baa- <dig> genome . both described genetic islands could be functionally virulence-associated, comprising several proteins for cell adhesion and other virulence-determining factors.

in addition, we found a unique  <dig> kb genetic island in the baa- <dig> genome, coding for bacteriocin-associated genes . this region contains genes for lanthionine biosynthesis and for a bacteriocin/lanthionine exporter orthologous to genes described in s. mutants and s. ratti. lanthionine is a lantibiotic , a unique class of peptide antibiotic substances  <cit> . conducting an agar overlay experiment, we revealed an inhibited growth of lactococcus lactis, resulting in a zone of clearing around baa- <dig> .

three genes  are partly homologue to hemolysin a, hemolysin iii and an undefined hemolysin-like protein, although group d streptococci are usually non-hemolytic or eventually display weak alpha hemolysis. moreover, baa- <dig> does show alpha-hemolysis on schaedler agar with 5% sheep blood.

the polysaccharide capsule coding region, contains  <dig> genes . the genes are located in a  <dig>  kb region and are identical to the ucn <dig> genome.

comparison of surface proteins
we predicted  <dig> proteins with c-terminal lpxtg motif by in silico analysis. additionally, we found orthologous or similar genes to all the proteins with mscramms characteristics described by sillanpää et al. regarding the s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus tx <dig> genome  and to genes mentioned by rusinok et al. regarding the ucn <dig> genome   <cit> . all genes with the lpxtg motif and their best hits in related genomes are listed in table  <dig> 

the indicated percentage in brackets represents the query coverage to the orthologous gene and the identities revealed by blastn 

within the analysis, we found three proteins containing the lpxtg motif carried by genomic islands specific to strain baa- <dig>  the gene sggbaa2069_c <dig> and its paralog sggbaa2069_c <dig> have only very weak similarities to gallo_ <dig> and code for a putative major cell surface adhesin . the gene sggbaa2069_c <dig> and its paralog sggbaa2069_c <dig> have cell anchor characteristics but no similarities to functional genes. furthermore, the unique protein sggbaa2069_c <dig> comprising the lpxtg motif is another gene with putative function in virulence.

protective elements
in comparison to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus ucn <dig>  the baa- <dig> holds two more restriction enzyme genes. the type iii enzyme sthir  is located on a  <dig>  kb unique island , together with the corresponding restriction-methylation subunit and an integrase gene. another type ii restriction endonuclease eco47ii and its modification methylase is encoded on a  <dig>  kb region .

mentionable regions missing in baa- <dig>  but present in the ucn- <dig> genome, are a  <dig> kb phage-associated region containing a putative phage-associated cell wall hydrolase. a "cluster regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats"  element is sited between  <dig> , <dig> -  <dig> , <dig> bp and containing  <dig> repetitions of a  <dig> bp consensus sequence. another  <dig>  kb crispr associated region is sited at  <dig> , <dig> -  <dig> , <dig> bp but mostly conserved between the two strains . a unique crispr locus for baa- <dig> is between  <dig> , <dig> -  <dig> , <dig> bp. corresponding cas genes are for baa- <dig> sggbaa2069_c <dig> and c <dig> , c <dig> , respectively gallo_ <dig>  gallo_ <dig>  and gallo_ <dig>  gallo_ <dig>  for ucn <dig>  crispr data of both genomes are also accessible by crisprs web server http://crispr.u-psud.fr.

genome comparison to related species
to evaluate the genetic distance to related species, a direct comparison to the taxonomically most closely related species with available whole genome sequences, in particular s. uberis 0140j and s. agalactiae 2603v_r was conducted. the analysis revealed a core genome consisting of  <dig> genes common to all three species, whereas s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus baa- <dig> has  <dig> unique genes . furthermore, we included three enterococcus faecalis genomes . comparison analysis revealed a set of  <dig> common genes, including a putative hemolysin a gene , a fibronectin/fibrinogen binding protein  and a sortase a gene  which could have a possible conserved role in virulence . a complete list of common or unique orfs in comparison to baa- <dig>  considering all known streptococcus genomes, is shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  furthermore, a taxonomic analysis based on alignment of core genomes was performed . the calculation includes the total number of coding sequences common to all analyzed species  <cit> . the revealing phylogenetic tree indicates a huge genomic diversity between s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus and related whole genome sequenced species.

plasmid
a plasmid designated as psgg <dig> was identified by sequence analysis and later isolated from s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus baa- <dig> . the plasmid psgg <dig> consists of  <dig>  bp and contains  <dig> orfs, of which  <dig> genes code for proteins with similarities to sequence databases including the tetracycline resistance gene tetl  and the mosaic tetracycline resistance gene tet, which are common in plasmids of gram-positive pathogens. two insertion sequence is <dig> elements and a putative resolvase and a relaxase gene were identified. the relaxase gene has similarities to plasmid ptet <dig> from campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 81- <dig>  which suggests its classification of the conjugative transfer system in clade mobp <dig>  although, it is more likely that it belongs to the mobv cluster, which is still ancestrally related to mobp  <cit> . the replication is probably regulated by one of four putative rep elements, belonging to rep_ <dig> superfamily  and rep_ <dig> superfamily . the repa  element has 78% sequence identity to that of the cryptic plasmid psbo <dig> isolated from s. equinus  <cit> . however, we were not able to determine the functional rep gene by in silico analysis. the plasmid psgg <dig> seems to be incapable of conjugal self-transfer since it encodes no tra protein and only a putative resolvase, although it was not tested experimentally. moreover, a mobilization region orthologous to a mob gene in streptococcus ferrus was found , which is a necessary feature for transmissible plasmids and therefore promotes the ability for lgt transfer in presence of a helper conjugative plasmid. five orfs were assigned to encode proteins with unknown functions and no significant sequence similarities to previously described genes exist in these cases . the analysis of sequence identity to other plasmids or genomes reveals a mosaic-like structure representing a high number of similarities with common habitants of the rumen or the gastrointestinal tract, including different streptococcal species as well as enterococcus and others. in particular, the tetracycline resistance genes, which are very common among streptococci, are partly identical among many different plasmids and species, although no similarities in arrangement of resistance genes were observed. to evaluate the distribution of psgg <dig> among strains of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with different origin , we screened  <dig> strains by southern blot hybridization analysis with a digoxygenin nick-labeled probe of psgg <dig> . we identified and isolated a plasmid  mainly homologous to psgg <dig> in another strain , originally isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infectious endocarditis. the restriction fragment analysis of psgg <dig> revealed a partially different pattern in comparison to psgg <dig>  indicating sequence variation between both plasmids . in further experiments we sequenced the psgg <dig> plasmid and revealed only differences in non-coding regions .

in order to analyze whether the frequency and phenotype of tetracycline resistance of strain baa- <dig> is coincident with the presence of psgg <dig>  we screened  <dig> s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains for presence of tetl and mob genes by pcr. additionally, we performed a tetracycline susceptibility test. the epidemiological cut-off for the wt of related streptococci is ≤  <dig> μg/ml http://eucast.org. about 42% of strains were growth-inhibited by a tetracycline concentration between  <dig> - <dig> μg/ml, and 95% of strains tested were unable to grow at concentrations higher than  <dig> μg/ml. the two strains which showed a tetracycline mic value of  <dig> μg/ml carrying the psgg plasmid, and only these were screened positively for tetl and mob genes .

discussion
the present study describes the full genome sequence of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus baa- <dig> and the comparison to related genomes in order to evaluate possible virulence-associated characteristics of this species. previous publications have shown a significant diversity in adhesion and invasion potential for binding to endothelial host cells, as well as binding to ecm proteins in vitro  <cit> . other studies have shown that virulence gene profiles are associated with disease  <cit> . therefore genomic comparison analysis provides the basis for understanding pathogenicity.

within whole genome comparison analysis the "pan-genome" includes a core genome containing genes present in all strains of one species. this is complemented by an individual set of genes unique to a strain or not shared by all strains. with the growing number of sequenced strains, the increasing size of the pan-genome is evidence of the genomic diversity between different isolates of a distinct species. tettelin et al. have shown that in the case of streptococcus agalactiae the core genome of eight strains comprises about 80% of genes of any single genome, and exploration of data reveals that the gene reservoir is immense  <cit> , whereas in the case of bacillus anthracis the number of strain-specific genes after addition of the fourth strain was zero  <cit> . the number of strain-specific regions in the two analyzed s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains is, in contrast to s. agalactiae strains , about  <dig> % higher. this could be taken as a hint that, with the increasing number of sequenced strains, the pan-genome of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is far larger by proportion. however, these data are preliminary, pending the sequencing of further s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strains.

in a direct comparison to the recently sequenced strain ucn <dig>  <cit> , surprisingly many unique genes with putative virulence associated characteristics are present in each strain, which could be an indication that the pathogenicity of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is very diverse. the majority of exclusive sequences found in the ucn <dig> genome are located in three large regions representing  <dig> kb of sequence information , whereas the three largest unique regions in baa- <dig> constitute only  <dig> kb  of strain-specific sequence and mostly consist of smaller regions. however, the tendency of virulence factors to be located within genomic islands may lead to a higher ratio of exchangeability of such genes in comparison to other regions  <cit> . furthermore, additional restriction enzymes in baa- <dig> may have a function in protection against viral dna and heritable crispr elements are able to mediate immunity against phages and be transmitted to other organisms by genetic transformation events  <cit> .

surface proteins and in particular proteins belonging to "microbial surface component recognizing matrix molecules"  were shown to play a functional role in the pathogenesis of all bacteria. of specific interest is a group of proteins containing the c-terminal cell wall-sorting motif lpxtg, which serves as a recognition site for the membrane-associated sortase. after sortase-mediated cleavage of the protein, the polypeptide is covalently bound to the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell surface and can therefore promote the first step in bacterial adherence  <cit> . three of the  <dig> predicted lpxtg motif genes are unique for baa- <dig> and further studies are required to evaluate their contribution to pathogenicity.

in silico analysis of genome data strongly indicated the presence of a multi-copy plasmid. the purification of plasmid dna and further analysis of sequence data confirmed these hints and showed a localization of tetracycline resistance genes. analysis of plasmid distribution shows only two mainly homologous plasmids in  <dig> strains overall. therefore, the incidence of the psgg plasmids among s. gallolyticus isolates does not seem to be widespread. the mosaic tetracycline resistance gene tet is usually chromosomally located and mediates resistance by ribosome protection. it has been shown that the mosaic tet genes have a higher level of resistance than the original genes  <cit> . this could be verified by our experimental data, showing the strains carrying the psgg plasmid have the highest resistance levels. the tetl gene is generally found on plasmids and coding for a tetracycline efflux protein  <cit> . in contrast to the baa- <dig> strain, the tetracycline resistance of strain ucn <dig>  mediated by tetl and tetm, was located on the chromosome and adjacent to putative plasmid and transposon tn916-associated genes  <cit> . this indicates a strong dependence between high tetracycline resistance mediated by tetl and the occurrence of plasmids of the psgg family.

because of antibiotic treatment, gastrointestinal tract and rumen are well-known reservoirs of mobilizable antibiotic resistance genes  <cit> . furthermore, the transfer of antibiotic resistance across several species and genera between commensal bacteria is well known, and habitants with a dense population and, in particular, the ability to form biofilms, are optimal for genetic transfer  <cit> . especially because, s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a commensal and facultative pathogen of animals, the intensive tetracycline treatments in animal husbandry, causes a general advantage regarding evolutionary fitness for pathogenic and natural habitants of the intestinal tract to accommodate resistance genes by lgt  <cit> . although the plasmid psgg <dig> is incapable of conjugal self-transfer, it is mobilizable by a helper conjugative plasmid. these findings suggest that it may play a functional role in lgt between different streptococcal groups and further related species. however, the detection of only two plasmids out of  <dig> strains is so far not evidence of lgt, but further screening of a huge variety of strains in combination with epidemiological studies should help to evaluate the role of psgg plasmids.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presented the analysis and comparison of the whole genome sequence of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain baa- <dig>  a causative agent of infective endocarditis. the results promote identification of genetic factors concerning the pathogenesis and adhesion to ecm. novel candidate genes were detected probably contributing to the pathogenicity. the comparison to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain ucn <dig> revealed significant differences concerning virulence factors, surface proteins and protective elements.

furthermore, we detected for the first time the presence of the psgg <dig> plasmid, containing  <dig> orfs including mosaic tetracycline resistance genes and may play a functional role in lateral gene transfer.
