BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. it is a transient member of the normal bacterial flora that colonizes the upper respiratory tract of the host being a major cause of various diseases such as otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. despite the constant development of therapeutics, antimicrobial drugs and vaccines, pneumococcal infection still causes severe diseases in young children, elderly people and immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . in adults, pneumococcal infection is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and otitis media and, since the introduction of vaccination against haemophilus influenzae  and neisseria meningitidis also the most frequent cause of meningitis.

current immunization strategies focus on the use of s. pneumoniae polysaccharides-based vaccines, employing the 23-valent vaccine, which protects humans from two years of age, and the 7-valent toxoid-conjugated vaccine, used in children less than two years old  <cit> . however, the available vaccines have several limitations due to the low immunogenicity of capsular polysaccharides, the high serotype variability and the genomic plasticity of this bacterium. therefore, in the last decade there has been a great effort in developing improved vaccines to prevent pneumococcal disease.

several surface-associated proteins, which are well conserved among the different strains of s. pneumoniae and thus represent candidates of choice for the development of novel vaccine formulations have been identified and characterized. among this class of proteins the immunoglobulin a <dig>  protease is a promising candidate since  it plays a major role in pathogen's resistance to the host immune response  <cit> , and  it is present in all pneumococcal strains and serotypes  <cit> . the importance of iga protease is underlined by the fact that this host-specific enzyme is conserved in other pathogens of comparable disease and colonising similar niches  <cit> .

the iga <dig> protease is one of the two to four large zinc metalloproteinase present in the pneumococcal genome  <cit> . the pneumococcal protease is a polypeptide of about  <dig> amino acids associated to the bacterium via n-terminal anchoring  <cit> . it is a proteolytic enzyme that specifically cleaves human iga <dig> antibodies in the hinge region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain  <cit> .

cross-inhibition experiments performed with sera from immunized rabbits have revealed considerable serological diversity of iga <dig> proteases from different s. pneumoniae strains  <cit> . serological analysis indicated that the sequence repeats domain of s. sanguis iga <dig> protease was immunogenic in rabbits and in humans, although the antibodies recognizing this region did not inhibit enzyme activity  <cit> . specific antibodies reacting with iga <dig> protease have been detected in sera from patients hospitalized for pneumococcal infection  <cit>  as well as in young children  <cit> , highlighting the immunogenity of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease in humans.

the aim of this work was to identify the immunodominant epitopes of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease involved in the human antibody response against bacterial infection.

RESULTS
in a recent study, we isolated several antigenic regions of s. pneumoniae proteins by challenging a pneumococcal genome display library with antibodies from one patient infected by the bacterium  <cit> . in the present work a similar approach was employed by using "ad-hoc" patients' sera which displayed a low titer of antibodies against the pneumococcal antigens identified in the previous study . accordingly, sera from two patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia were used for a novel screening of the pneumococcal library. phage pools were analyzed after two round of affinity selection and  <dig> out of  <dig> screened phage clones  were isolated by immunoscreening. among them,  <dig> clones  contained insert encoding fragments of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease and  <dig> clones  contained insert of other bacterial proteins. at the end of the selection procedure,  <dig> distinct phage clones whose dna inserts matched the sequence of the pneumococcal iga gene product were identified: clone sp <dig>  with a dna insert encoding for a protein fragment of  <dig> amino acids; clone sp <dig> encoding for a polypeptide of  <dig> residues; clone sp <dig> encoding for a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids. as shown in figure  <dig>  all the protein inserts of the selected phages contain a common region of  <dig> amino acids corresponding to residues 420– <dig> of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease .

to characterize the biochemical and immunological properties of the selected protein fragments independently from the phage display context, the dna inserts of phages sp <dig> and sp <dig> were subcloned into vector pgex-sn  <cit> . this resulted in the expression of gst fusion proteins which were purified from e. coli cells under native conditions by 1-step affinity chromatography. the recombinant proteins were efficiently expressed and purified in large amounts from the cytoplasm of bacterial cells, with the yields of purified gst-sp <dig> and gst-sp <dig> being  <dig> and  <dig> mg per liter of bacterial culture, respectively. immunoreactivity of recombinant antigens with immunoglobulins g  of human sera was examined. to this aim, an enzyme-linked immunoassay was employed . the gst-sp <dig> and gst-sp <dig> fusion proteins were assayed with  <dig> sera collected from healthy adults. as a control, the igg reactivity against wild-type gst protein was assessed for each serum. the criterion used to assign a specific reactivity against single antigens was an odgst-antigen greater than twice the odgst. both the sp <dig> and sp <dig> polypeptides specifically reacted with more than 80% of serum samples .

next, the presence of immunodominant epitopes within the selected antigen fragments was investigated. to this purpose, the common region of sp <dig> and sp <dig> protein fragments, corresponding to amino acids 420– <dig> of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease was analyzed. figure  <dig> shows the alignment of this polypeptide of strain d <dig> to iga proteases of other pneumococci and related species. in strain d <dig> such the sequence contains three  <dig> amino acid repeats which are part of a region of the iga protease found to show high intraspecies conservation and a high degree of interspecies variability  <cit> . pneumococcal iga proteases fall in this region into two clusters: iga <dig> proteases in genomes of strains of serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6b all have three repeats and a common downstream region while other strains share a common downstream region with s. mitis and have from two , to seven , eight  or even nine of these highly conserved  <dig> amino acid repeats. the sequences of iga proteases of other oral streptococci such as s. sanguinis or s. oralis can not be aligned in this region since no significant homology was detected.

two gst fusion proteins, respectively carrying residues 420– <dig>  and 458– <dig>  of the iga <dig> protease from s. pneumoniae r <dig> strain were expressed. as shown in figure  <dig>  the recombinant gst-epia and gst-epib antigens were efficiently purified under native conditions from transformed e. coli cells. immunoreactivity of recombinant antigens with igg antibodies of human sera was examined and the results were compared to those obtained by use of the largest fragment of the iga <dig> protease . the gst-epia, gst-epib and gst-sp <dig> antigens were assayed by rec-elisa with serum samples from the two patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia  and from  <dig> healthy individuals. immunoreactivity of wild-type gst was also assessed for each serum. as shown in table  <dig>  the recombinant gst-sp <dig>  gst-epia and gst-epib proteins specifically reacted with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the sera, respectively, highlighting a broad antibody recognition of all antigen fragments.

pa pserum samples from patients with pneumococcal pneumonia  and from healthy adults  were analyzed by igg rec-elisa with individual recombinant proteins.

pb pthe cutoff values were determined for each serum as two times the od readings obtained with the gst. boldface type, od values greater than the cutoff values.

because of the broad reactivity of the epia fragment, its recognition by antibodies present in sera from young children was also investigated. serum samples from forty children with an age comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> years were assayed with the recombinant gst-epia antigen by rec-elisa. as shown in fig.  <dig>  specific igg antibodies against the epia polypeptide were detected in sera from the majority of subjects , thus demonstrating that 68% of children less than  <dig> years old had specific antibodies against this short polypeptide.

next, a detailed epitope mapping was performed employing affinity-purified antibodies. specific immunoglobulins against the gst-epia fusion protein were purified from  <dig> epia-reactive sera and then assayed with the recombinant gst-epia, gst-epib and gst-sp <dig> antigens by rec-elisa. as a negative control, the igg reactivity against wild-type gst protein was also assessed. as shown in table  <dig>  the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies specifically recognized both the epia and epib polypeptides as well as the large sp <dig> fragment, indicating that a common epitope was present in the epia and epib protein sequences.

pa precombinant antigens were ppanalyzed by igg rec-elisa with a homogeneos mixture of human sera  or with affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies

pb pthe cutoff values for the igg rec-elisa with the recombinant gst-epia, gst-epib, and gst-sp <dig> proteins were calculated as two times the od readings obtained with the gst. boldface type, od values greater than the cutoff values.

next, to exclude non-specific immunoreactivity due either to altered conformation of the small polypeptides with respect to native iga <dig> protease or to cross-reactivity of unrelated antibodies in human sera, a western blot analysis was performed. to this aim, a whole cell lysate of s. pneumoniae was challenged with the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies. bacterial lysates from pneumococcal iga-deficient mutant strain fp <dig> and from streptococcus gordonii were assayed as controls. as shown in figure  <dig>  a unique protein band with an apparent molecular mass higher than  <dig> kda specifically reacted with the anti-epia antibodies in an unencapsulated strain of pneumococcus . in the fp <dig> mutant strain, in which the iga gene was deleted, as well as in s. gordonii, such a protein band was not visible, demonstrating that the anti-epia antibodies specifically recognized the pneumococcal enzyme.

finally, to investigate whether the epia polypeptide is exposed on the bacterium and is recognizable by anti-epia antibodies, a cell-elisa analysis was performed on whole s. pneumoniae cells. the fp <dig> strain was used as the negative control. the affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies reacted with intact bacterial cells  but not with the iga-deleted fp <dig> strain , indicating that the epia epitope within the tandem repeats of the pneumococcal enzyme is indeed exposed in the native state. noteworthy, our results are in close agreement with a previous work where it was demonstrated that the tandem repeats of s. sanguis iga <dig> protease contain immunodominant epitopes exposed in the denatured and native state  <cit> .

discussion
bacterial iga <dig> proteases are highly specific endopeptidases that are secreted by a small number of bacteria associated with humans  <cit> . iga <dig> protease-producing bacteria include the mucosal pathogens n. meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, u. urealyticum and some members of pharyngeal microfloras such as prevotella, gemella haemolysans, s. sanguis, s. oralis and s. mitis  <cit> . the importance of this bacterial enzyme in the interaction with the host is evidenced by the fact that most of these enzymes are specific for human iga only, and that their impact on the host is so great as to become one of the few recognised factors of positive evolutionary selection on the human genome  <cit> . for the bacterial pathogens colonizing mucosal surfaces, iga <dig> protease production represents a virulent factor and contributes to the pathogenesis of invasive infection by cleaving the fc receptor from secreted immunoglobulins a <dig>  thus preventing opsonophagocytosis  <cit> . iga <dig> proteases have been shown to be targets of enzyme-neutralizing antibodies in serum and secretions  <cit> , which may be induced in a state of bacterial carriage as well as during invasive infection  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated the potential of phage-display technology in identifying b-cell epitopes recognized by the human immune response against toxoplasma gondii and s. pneumoniae infection  <cit> , even though such a technique usually favors the identification of linear epitopes whereas conformational epitopes are often overlooked. nevertheless, the present work allowed the identification of antigenic regions of the pneumococcal iga <dig> protease that are broadly recognized by human antibodies. challenging a lambda-display library of s. pneumoniae with sera from patients hospitalized for pneumococcal pneumonia enabled the selection of three distinct clones harboring a common region of the iga <dig> protease. all clone sequences matched the pneumococcal enzyme encompassing amino acids 360– <dig>  the immunoreactivity of the selected fragments, expressed as gst fusion products, was assessed; overall, igg antibodies in serum samples from more than 90% of healthy adults reacted with at least one antigen fragment, which emphasizes the broad recognition of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease by the human b cell response.

because of the broad reactivity of the selected iga <dig> protease fragments, a detailed characterization of their common region, composed by  <dig> amino acids, was performed. this lead to classify the sequence corresponding to residues 420– <dig>  of the iga gene product as the most reactive polypeptide, which was recognized by antibodies present in sera from 90% of healthy adults and 68% of children with an age comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> years, thus suggesting that the human antibody response against iga <dig> protease occurs during childhood. noteworthy, our data are in agreement with a previous study showing that igg antibodies from the majority of children less than two years old specifically reacted with pneumococcal antigens, including the iga <dig> protease  <cit> .

the evidence that affinity-purified anti-epia antibodies also reacted with the epib fragment  indicated that a common epitope within polypeptides was recognized by human sera. notably, a repeated 9-mer sequence vvtdkgepe is present twice in epia and once in epib fragments . this duplication might account for the larger reactivity of the epia peptide with respect to the epib peptide.

the iga <dig> protease of s. pneumoniae is a major antigen expressed in all known pneumococcal strains  <cit> . despite the pneumococcal enzyme has a peculiar structure among bacterial proteases, homology searches have indicated that the iga gene of s. pneumoniae is also found in other streptococci and related organisms  <cit> . as already noted by others, the repeats region shows high conservation within the different pneumococcal strains and between s. pneumoniae and the most closely related s. mitis , while homology to iga proteases from other streptococci is significantly lower in this segment when compared to the rest of the molecule  <cit> . the epia peptide identified in this work is conserved in all pneumococci and in two out of three s. mitis strains  <cit> , while it is not conserved in other oral streptococci sequenced so far. the fact that the domain covered by epia is not shared with oral streptococci other than s. mitis suggests that this domain is probably not interchangeable, which reduces the risk of escape mutants by horizontal gene transfer. in other words, this would indicate that any reservoir of divergent iga <dig> proteases in non pneumococcal species should not be imported readily by recombination into pneumococcus.

we have shown here that an immunodominant polypeptide , located within the sequence repeats domain of pneumococcal iga <dig> protease, is well conserved among several serotypes and strains of s. pneumoniae but not to the corresponding regions of the iga gene products from other streptococci such as s. oralis, s. sanguis and s. sanguinis. however, we also found a very high sequence homology of this protein region between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis , suggesting that the observed high rate of seropositivity against pneumococcal iga <dig> protease might be due to early colonization with bacteria species other than pneumococcus.

CONCLUSIONS
the broad and specific recognition of the epia polypeptide by human sera demonstrates that the pneumococcal iga <dig> protease contains an immunodominant b-cell epitope. in perspective, it will be of great interest to investigate the ability of the anti-epia antibodies in conferring protective immunity against s. pneumoniae infection in animal models. the use of phage display libraries to identify microbe or disease-specific antigens recognized by the human sera is a promising and valuable approach to epitope discovery.
