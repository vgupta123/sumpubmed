BACKGROUND
leptospirosis, a worldwide zoonotic infection, is an important human and veterinary health problem. caused by spirochaetes of the genus leptospira, the disease presents greater incidence in tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> . the transmission of leptospirosis has been associated with exposure of individuals near to wild or farm animals  <cit> . recently, the disease has been prevalent in cities with sanitation problems and a large population of urban rodent reservoirs, which contaminate the environment through their urine  <cit> . in the host, leptospirosis has a biphasic clinical presentation beginning with a septicemic followed by an immune phase with antibody production and urinary excretion of leptospires. children primarily show fever, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, abdominal and generalized muscle pain, whereas adults have fever, headache, anorexia, muscle pain and constipation  <cit> . the most severe form of leptospirosis, known as weil's syndrome, seen in  <dig> to 15% of patients, is a multisystemic febrile illness, chiefly with hepatic, renal and pulmonary involvement and a mortality rate of  <dig> to 40%  <cit> . leptospirosis also has a great economic impact in the agricultural industry because the disease affects livestock inducing abortions, stillbirths, infertility, reduced milk production and death  <cit> .

the advent of whole-genome sequencing has greatly impacted on the microbial field with the development of new large-scale technologies, such as bioinformatics. this approach has the advantage of revealing proteins independently of their abundance and without the need of culturing the microorganism in vitro  <cit> . functional genomic studies, including transcription profiles, gene cloning, protein expression and characterization complement the in silico analysis and help in understanding the bacterial pathogenesis. the genome of l. interrogans serovar copenhageni has been sequenced and in silico analysis identified more than  <dig> predicted outer membrane proteins  <cit> . these proteins are potential targets for inducing immune responses during host infection and therefore, constitute targets for immune protection through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent phagocytosis and killing mediated by complement. in addition, it is possible that some of these membrane proteins mediate the initial adhesion to host cells  <cit> . leptospiral adhesins have been described: a 36-kda fibronectin-binding protein of unknown identity isolated from the outer sheath of a virulent variant of pathogenic leptospires  <cit> , a 24-kda laminin-binding protein named lsa <dig>  <cit> /lfha  <cit> , liga and ligb proteins  <cit> . more recently, lsa <dig>  <cit> /lfha  <cit>  was shown to belong to a paralog family designated leptospira endostatin-like proteins   <cit> . some proteins of the len family were capable to bind host fibronectin  <cit> . fibronectin binding activity has been also shown with liga and ligb proteins  <cit>  and a domain of the ligb protein that contributes to this binding has recently been described  <cit> .

several predicted surface-coding sequences were selected from the genome of l. interrogans serovar copenhageni and are under study in our laboratory  <cit> . in the present study, we focused on a novel hypothetical protein of unknown function, encoded by the gene lic <dig>  the gene was cloned and the protein expressed using e. coli as a heterologous host system. the recombinant protein of  <dig> kda was purified and its capacity to mediate attachment to various extracellular matrix  components was evaluated. we have found that this novel leptospiral protein is a surface exposed adhesin that binds strongly to laminin, fibronectin  and collagen iv. the gene coding for lsa <dig>  is expressed in low passage virulent fiocruz l1- <dig>  lpf and lo <dig> strains of l. interrogans, and is regulated by osmolarity and temperature. anti-lsa <dig> serum labeled liver and kidney tissues of human fatal cases of leptospirosis. our data suggest a role of lsa <dig> in pathogenesis and virulence.

RESULTS
cloning, expression and purification of recombinant protein
the choice of predicted surface-cds was mostly based on cellular localization since surface proteins are potential targets for mediating adhesion to host. thus, the lic <dig> cds was predicted to be an outer membrane protein  according to psort program  <cit> . the lipop server predicted lic <dig> cds to be a lipoprotein with a cleavage site for signal peptidase ii at amino acids 18– <dig>  <cit> . it is a hypothetical protein with no known domain by blast  <cit>  and pfam analysis  <cit> . identical predicted coding sequence of lic <dig> was identified in l. interrogans serovar lai  <cit>  but absent in l. borgpetersenii  <cit>  and l. biflexa  <cit>  genome sequences. the gene was amplified, without the signal peptide sequence, and the dna insert cloned and expressed as a full-length protein in e. coli. recombinant protein was expressed with 6xhis tag at the n-terminal, purified by metal chelation chromatography, and an aliquot of each step of the process was analyzed through sds-page . the expected protein band of  <dig> kda is shown in nacl-e. coli bl <dig> -induced culture, in insoluble form, as inclusion bodies . although the lsa <dig> protein presented low expression level, it was consistently recovered from the column as single major band . structural integrity of the purified protein was assessed by circular dichroism  spectroscopy. as depicted in fig. 1b, the recombinant protein may encompass a mixture of both α-helices and β-sheets in its secondary structure composition. the experimental data obtained with lsa <dig> is similar to the secondary structure content of the native protein predicted by computational analysis  <cit> .

distribution and expression of lic <dig> gene among leptospire strains
the presence of lic <dig> gene in five pathogenic strains and in one saprophytic strain was examined by pcr with a pair of primers designed according to l. interrogans serovar copenhageni genome sequences. a 540-bp dna fragment covering almost the entire lic <dig> predicted cds was amplified by pcr in all five strains belonging to the pathogenic species l. interrogans serovars: canicola, copenhageni, hardjo, icterohaemorrhagiae and pomona. no amplification product was detected in the non-pathogenic l. biflexa serovar patoc strain patoc  <dig> . fragments excised from the gel were purified, cloned into the pgem-t easy vector , and inserts were sequenced. multiple sequence alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the five serovars harboring the lic <dig> gene revealed high conserved identity among the tested strains .

the ability of both high-  and low-  passage in vitro cultured leptospires to express lic <dig> was assessed by pcr amplification of reversely transcribed total rna. significant levels of gene product could be detected in all three low-passage strains tested , whereas among the high-passage strains detectable amounts of lic <dig> transcripts were only observed for the hond utrechet iv strain . integrity of total rna used in rt-pcr experiments was assured by the presence of a  <dig> -bp 16s ribosomal cdna fragment in all samples .

regulation of lic <dig> by environmental cues
it is well known that prolonged culture promotes leptospiral virulence attenuation  <cit> , and it has been suggested that expression of virulence factors may be downregulated upon sequential in vitro culture passages  <cit> . to evaluate the effect of culture-attenuation by in vitro passages on lic <dig> expression, the virulent low-passage strains l. interrogans serovar pomona strain lpf, l. interrogans serovar canicola strain lo <dig>  and the reference high-passage strains l. interrogans serovar pomona strain pomona, l. interrogans serovar canicola strain hond utrechet iv were grown to late-log phase and collected for rna isolation. rt-pcr analyses of lic <dig> transcripts were performed, and a significant reduction of gene expression was already observed after  <dig>  or  <dig>  passages, thus indicating that lic <dig> expression is rapidly reduced with sequential in vitro culture passages. amplified products were not detected in control reactions lacking reverse transcriptase, ruling out dna contamination.

as our results pointed to a correlation between virulence and lic <dig> expression, we decided to examine whether environmental factors, such as osmolarity and temperature could influence lic <dig> regulation at the transcriptional level. all rt-pcr assays were performed with the virulent, low-passage l. interrogans serovar pomona strain lpf. induction of lic <dig> expression by osmolarity was assessed by growing cultures at 29°c in emjh supplemented with 1% rabbit serum and resuspending them in fresh emjh medium or in emjh containing  <dig> mm nacl. the addition of  <dig> mm nacl to the medium mimics physiological conditions  encountered by leptospires upon entry into the host  <cit> . cultures were incubated for  <dig> h and examined for gene expression. lic <dig> expression was also evaluated in a culture grown under our standard laboratory conditions. as a positive control, we included rt-pcr data for the lipl <dig> gene  . this gene codes for a predicted lipoprotein reactive with sera from patients with leptospirosis  <cit>  and was shown to be strongly up-regulated by sodium chloride in a recently published paper  <cit> . as shown in fig. 3b, lic <dig> expression appears to be regulated by the osmolarity of the growth medium, because transcripts were detected only upon incubation with additional nacl, or with a rich emjh medium containing more serum and salts. similar up regulation was observed with lipl <dig> expression, as previously detected by microarrays analysis  <cit> .

temperature is another important environmental signal that may affect protein expression in bacteria. the transition of temperatures from ambient to mammalian body  has been correlated with changes in the expression of virulence determinants in many pathogens  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that l. interrogans also regulates protein synthesis in response to in vitro temperature changes  <cit> . therefore, we compared lic <dig> gene expression patterns of cultures grown at 20°c, 29°c and 37°c, reflecting ambient temperatures in the environment, growth under laboratory conditions, and mammalian host body core temperature. transcriptional analyses were also performed with cultures subjected to temperature upshifts from 29°c to 37°c and from 37°c to 39°c during an overnight period to simulate conditions experienced by leptospires in the early stages of infection and during febrile stage. lic <dig> transcript levels gradually increased when cultures grown at 20°c, 29°c and 37°c were compared . an overnight upshift from 29°c to 37°c had no effect on lic <dig> expression, while an upshift from 37° to 39°c seems to have down-regulated gene expression . our results indicate that temperature is another critical parameter involved in the control of lic <dig> gene expression. densitometric readings provided information regarding accumulation of lic <dig> transcripts .

cellular localization of lsa <dig> protein
indirect immunofluorescence was used to examine whether lsa <dig> protein is surface-exposed. a similar protocol has been previously employed to evaluate the capability of leptospira to bind factor h  <cit> . the low-passage l. interrogans serovar pomona strain lpf reacted with antiserum directed against recombinant lsa <dig> protein, but no staining was observed with the l. biflexa serovar patoc strain patoc  <dig> . pre-immune serum failed to elicit a positive signal in both strains .

adhesion of lsa <dig> protein to ecm components
as lsa <dig> protein is suggested to be surface-exposed and might play a role in virulence, we queried whether it could mediate host colonization by adhering to extracellular matrix proteins. therefore, we examined its interaction with laminin, collagen type i, collagen type iv, cellular fibronectin, and plasma fibronectin. bsa and fetuin were included as negative controls and binding assays were performed by an elisa-based assay  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  lsa <dig> protein bound to all immobilized ecm macromolecules tested, but no interaction was detected with bsa or fetuin. as a negative control, we have included another recombinant protein, rlic <dig>  known as loa <dig>  <cit> , and recently described as a virulence factor in leptospira species  <cit> . a stronger interaction was observed with laminin, collagen iv and plasma fibronectin. this interaction was also assessed on a quantitative basis as illustrated in fig. 6a. a dose-dependent binding was observed when increasing concentrations of the recombinant protein  were allowed to adhere to a fixed laminin, collagen iv or fibronectin concentration .

protein binding is affected by laminin oxidation
to investigate the role of laminin carbohydrate moieties in the interaction with lsa <dig> protein, laminin was oxidized by increasing concentrations of sodium metaperiodate  for  <dig> min at 4°c. the mild treatment ensures cleavage of vicinal carbohydrate hydroxyl groups, but the polypeptide chain structure remains intact  <cit> . oxidation effect was dose-dependent and a significant reduction  in lsa <dig> protein attachment to metaperiodate-treated laminin was observed at a  <dig> mm concentration of periodate . these data indicate that laminin sugar residues are critical for the interaction of lsa <dig> protein with this major ecm glycoprotein.

sequence comparison between lsa <dig> and leptospiral adhesions
to investigate whether lsa <dig> protein shared a sequence similarity or a common domain with other previously identified leptospiral ecm- binding proteins  <cit>  we proceeded with a sequence analysis using clustal x program and a tree-display nj plot  <cit> . the calculated tree derived from sequence alignment is depicted in fig.  <dig> and clearly shows that lsa <dig> sequence is unrelated to both len protein family and liga/ligb proteins. contrasting with the len and lig proteins that divide a common branch inside their family, lsa <dig> appears alone on its branch.

lsa <dig> is expressed during human leptospiral infection
ihc  analysis showed essentially similar results in all  <dig> patients diagnosed with weil's syndrome. it is necessary to point out that, due to the relatively short interval between autopsy and the patients' death, tissues were better preserved, and classical findings such as liver-plate disarray, although present, were not prominent. leptospiral lsa <dig> antigen was frequently detected as red deposits in the cytoplasm of isolated macrophages along the sinusoidal lining  . similar deposits were rarely observed in macrophages of the portal inflammatory infiltrate. lsa <dig> antigen was also observed focally on the sinusoidal side of the membrane of hepatocytes and as small granules in the underneath cytoplasm . lsa <dig> protein was infrequently seen over endothelial cells of portal vessels and supra-hepatic branches. in the kidney lsa <dig> antigen was present in the luminal side of epithelial cells of the distal nephron, particularly distal tubules and collecting ducts . as observed in liver cells, antigen granules were also identified in the cytoplasm below the cellular membrane. no definite lsa <dig> expression was detected in epithelial cells of the proximal tubules. lsa <dig> deposit in the cytoplasm of macrophages of the focal interstitial inflammatory infiltrate was rarely observed .

discussion
the characterization of leptospiral outer membrane proteins represents an important step toward the understanding of leptospirosis pathogenicity. to date, there has been little functional analysis of leptospira membrane proteins, in spite of their unquestionable relevance to host-pathogen interactions. bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequences of l. interrogans serovar copenhageni revealed more than  <dig> predicted outer membrane proteins that merit further studies  <cit> . in this report, we have characterized one of those hypothetical proteins, a surface leptospiral adhesin of  <dig> kda, named lsa <dig> that may play a role in pathogenesis.

the lic <dig> expression is mostly detected in low-passage virulent strains . culture attenuation has also been reported for the liga and b proteins, leptospiral antigens recognized during the acute host infection  <cit> . although a larger sample set will be required for definite conclusion, our findings suggest a correlation between lsa <dig> protein and virulence.

the lic <dig> gene is up regulated by osmolarity, another distinguishing feature shared with liga and b genes  <cit> . the addition of 120mm nacl to the culture medium reproduces the host's serum osmolarity , thus providing a more physiological environment for leptospiral growth. in fact, emjh-salt supplementation enhanced lsa <dig> expression . it is worth mentioning that several predicted outer membrane proteins currently under study in our laboratory are responsive to physiologic osmolarity . it is not surprising because 6% of the l. interrogans genes are susceptible to osmoregulation  <cit> . osmotic control of gene expression has been reported as an environmental cue associated with virulence in a variety of pathogens  <cit> . in v. cholerae, optimum expression of cholera toxin and tcp pilli occurs within an osmolarity range that probably represents that of mucosal secretions  <cit> . transcription levels of inva, an s. typhimurium invasion gene, have also been reported to be considerably higher on media with high osmolarity  <cit> . moreover, genes controlling the p. aeruginosa capsule, an important pseudomonas virulence factor, are also subjected to osmoregulation  <cit> .

temperature induction of lic <dig> expression was also observed . maximal mrna levels were detected at 37°c, the body core temperature of most mammalian species. intriguingly, lic <dig> is not represented among the leptospiral genes found to be up-regulated in response to temperature or physiologic osmolarity, as assessed by whole-genome microarrays  <cit> . this could be explained by the fact that lic <dig> expression rapidly decreases after three or four passages in culture medium . in addition, optimum expression might occur when both physiological parameters  are combined.

lsa <dig> protein exhibits extracellular matrix-binding properties. it is thus possible that it may play a role in the attachment to host tissues. several leptospiral adhesins have been described, including a 36-kda fibronectin-binding protein  <cit> , a 24-kda laminin-binding protein named lsa <dig>  <cit> /lfha  <cit> , liga and ligb proteins  <cit> . recently, it has been demonstrated that l. interrogans contain five additional paralogs of lsa <dig>  <cit> /lfha  <cit> , designated as len-like proteins  <cit> . the len proteins were all found to bind laminin and in addition lenb, lenc, lend, lene and lenf have shown affinity to bind host fibronectin  <cit> .

lsa <dig> protein exhibits a broader spectrum binding profile because it interacts with laminin, collagen iv and fibronectin. similarly, other adhesins, namely the lig proteins  <cit> , have been reported to bind to different ecm macromolecules. in fact, attachment of leptospira to several ecm macromolecules, including laminin, collagen i, collagen iv, cellular fibronectin, and plasma fibronectin was previously shown  <cit> . interestingly, lsa <dig> shares neither sequence similarity nor a common domain with the len-like and the lig proteins. emp, a cell surface protein of staphylococcus aureus, strongly interacts with fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, and vitronectin  <cit> . the outer membrane protein yada of yersinia enterocolitica has been shown to bind to laminin, fibronectin, and several types of collagens  <cit> . enterococcus faecalis adhesin ace mediates attachment to laminin, and to collagens i and iv  <cit> . finally, the haemophilus influenzae hap autotransporter protein exhibits the same binding profile of lsa <dig> protein: it interacts with laminin, fibronectin and collagen iv  <cit> . chemical disruption of laminin carbohydrate moieties by sodium metaperiodate caused significant reduction in the binding activity of lsa <dig> protein, thus indicating the sugar moiety involvement in interactions between this recombinant protein and ecm macromolecules. possibly lsa <dig> protein interacts with a particular structural epitope shared by the ecm components mentioned above. a good candidate would be complex sugars of glycosylated proteins. during infection, injury of wall vessels exposes a repertoire of adhesive glycoproteins that constitute major targets for initial adherence of pathogens  <cit> . the extracellular matrix-binding properties of lsa <dig> together with the data of indirect immunofluorescence suggest that this protein is surface-exposed.

the presence of lsa <dig> antigen as demonstrated by ihc in cells, chiefly macrophages, of the inflammatory infiltrate both in human liver and kidney is expected because leptospirosis is an acute septicemic disease involving several organs and blood vessels. liver-plate disarray is a pathological finding described in human and experimental leptospirosis and in the human liver, its prominence is closely related to the interval between patient's death and the autopsy, thus indicating that post-mortem changes might accentuate the lesion. in any circumstance, liver-plate disarray supports speculation that cell membrane lesion might play an important role in leptospirosis pathogenesis  <cit> . although cross-reactivity between anti-lsa <dig> serum and other leptospiral proteins is not excluded, immunohistochemical detection of leptospiral antigens on the sinusoidal side of human hepatocytes is an infrequent finding in human leptospirosis when standard whole bacterial polyclonal sera were used  <cit> . the fact that lsa <dig> anti-serum stained hepatocyte membranes more often might strengthen the possible role of cell membrane lesion in the pathogenesis of the disease.

tubulo interstitial nephritis is the main manifestation of acute renal failure in leptospirosis and the renal injury is usually associated with polyuria. hypokalemia appear frequently with an elevated urinary fractional excretion of potassium, possibly due to proximal tubular lesions that is expressed both in human and experimental leptospirosis  <cit> . the ihc detection of the leptospiral antigenic protein lsa <dig> on the epithelial membrane of the distal nephron, particularly distal tubules and collecting ducts, might be, up to a certain point, unexpected when a functional correlation is attempted. however, it is known that in a normal state, urine is concentrated because of the combined functions of henle's loop and the collecting duct. therefore, we might speculate that the lsa <dig> deposits detected by ihc chiefly in collecting ducts might be interfering with the renal water absorption in leptospirosis, in spite of the absence of definite morphological alterations. altogether these results strongly suggest a role of this protein in the pathogenesis of the disease because no reactivity was seen in non-leptospirosis human fatal cases.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe a novel leptospiral surface adhesin of  <dig> kda, lsa <dig>  shown for the first time in human fatal cases of the disease, a finding that should contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of leptospiral pathogenesis.
