BACKGROUND
starch is one of the most abundant storage substances of plant. amylases, which consist of multiple kinds of carbohydrase, hydrolyzing starch into diverse low molecular weight products, such as dextrin, maltose and glucose, are one of the most important enzymes  <cit> . amylases are obtained from various sources including animals, plants and microorganisms, but only microbial amylase could meet the demands of industrial application due to its advantages in bulk production and other desired characteristics. glucoamylase  is an exo-acting enzyme which possesses strong activity of hydrolyzing polysaccharides into β-d-glucose by cleaving α- <dig>   <dig> glycosidic bond. glucoamylase could also cleave α- <dig>   <dig> glycosidic bond, but at low rate. when at high concentration of glucose , glucoamylase would catalyze glucose into oligosaccharides by reverse reaction  <cit> . alpha-amylase  is an endoamylase which hydrolyzes internal α- <dig>   <dig> glycosidic bond of starch, producing glucose, maltose and oligosaccharides  <cit> .

fungal amylase is more preferred in baking, brewing and sweeteners industries due to their more accepted generally recognized as safe status  <cit> . the processes of starch hydrolysis like saccharification need to perform at high temperature, however, the thermostabilities of most fungal glucoamylases are still not satisfactory. therefore, developing fungal glucoamylase with increased thermostability especially at acidic condition will give an edge in the starch hydrolysis. to this, searching thermostable glucoamylase from thermophilic fungi provides a very attractive alternative. although some thermostable glucoamylases from streptosporangium sp.  <cit> , aspergillus fumigates  <cit>  have been exploited, due to low yields and limited activity of these enzymes, nearly none of the thermostable fungal glucoamylase could meet the requirements of industrial production. so cloning the genes of thermostable fungal glucoamylase and heterologously expressing them in high-level expression system has been regarded as a promising way to accelerate the application of thermostable enzymes.

rhizomucor pusillus, a thermophilic fungus, growing well even at 50°c, has been reported to be the source of amylase by fergus  <cit>  and somkuti  <cit> . deploey  <cit>  later investigated the crude amylase produced by mucor pusillus and found the optimal temperature and ph were 65°c and  <dig> , respectively. and silva et al.  <cit>  studied the dextrinogenic and saccharogenic activity of crude amylase of r. pusillus. although kanlayakrit et al.  <cit>  purified and characterized a raw-starch-digesting glucoamylase from r. pusillus, the gene encoding glucoamylase of r. pusillus has not been cloned thus far.

co-expressing two or more enzymes in one host which avoids repeated fermentation facilitates the complex operation of extracting and purifying, and improves the cost-effectiveness of the process. it is an applicable and economic formulation in enzyme production. however, no report is presented on co-expressing glucoamylase with α-amylase in pichia pastoris. herein we reported on cloning a novel fungal glucoamylase and α-amylase from r. pusillus and high-level expression in p. pastoris respectively. furthermore, we firstly co-expressed the two enzymes in p. pastoris, improving both saccharogenic activity and dextrinogenic activity significantly.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of rpgla and rpamy genes
a partial gene fragments of 792-bp was amplified from genomic dna of r. pusillus gx- <dig> with the degenerate primers. then, a contiguous sequence extended to  <dig> -bp  was obtained by genome-walking method.

using primers containing putative start codon or stop codon , paired with primers corresponding to the conservative amino acids, several fragments were amplified from first-strand cdna of r. pusillus gx- <dig>  after sequencing and assembling the obtained cdna fragments, one complete open reading frame  was obtained, and then confirmed by continuous pcr amplification. the orf of r. pusillus glucoamylase  consisted of 1539-bp nucleotides, encoding a putative protein of  <dig> amino acid residues. blast analysis revealed that rpgla shared the highest identity of 51% with the rhizopus oryzae glucoamylase , indicating that rpgla was a novel glucoamylase. and the similarity with glucoamylse from mucor circinelloides  and aspergillus niger  were 50%, 36% respectively.

the rpgla was the second glucoamylase cloned from rhizomucor sp.. pedersen et al.  <cit>  cloned the first glucoamylase gene from rhizomucor sp.  for study of expression system, while did not investigate the enzymatic characterization.

race is the most widely used method to clone the full length cdna sequence of eukaryotic gene, but it is costly and requires multiple steps. in this report, we tried to find the putative start codons and stop codons using the conserved sites as reference points. this successful attempt provided a helpful and effective method for cloning the cdna of eukaryotic gene.

no signal peptide was present in the putative amino acid sequence of rpgla according to the analysis result using signalp  <dig>  program, implying that rpgla might be an intracellular or periplasmic enzyme.

the open reading frame of r. pusillus gx- <dig> α-amylase  was cloned and analyzed. it consisted of 1416-bp nucleotides, encoding a putative protein of  <dig> amino acid residues and had the highest similarity of 59% with the α-amylase from rhizopus oryzae   <cit> .

transformation, screening of pichia pastoris transformants
increasing the copy number of expression cassette generally has the effect of increasing the amount of protein expressed in p. pastoris  <cit> . transformants containing multiple copies of genes were obtained by electrotransformation and then screened on plates with higher concentrations of g <dig> or zeocin. the colonies km71/9kgla  and km71/zαamy  which chosen from ypds plates containing  <dig>  mg ml−1 g <dig> and 200 μg ml− <dig> zeocin respectively were inoculated on bmmy plates containing 2%  soluble starch for amylase activity detecting. after incubating for 2 days, the colonies transformed with glucoamylase or α-amylase gene all showed clearance zones, while the original p. pastoris showed no clearance zones. . it was demonstrated that rpgla and rpamy could be successfully expressed in p. pastoris and secreted into the medium.

plasmid zαamy was then transformed into recombinant p. pastoris km71/9kgla. since the recombinant p. pastoris km71/9kgla could not grow on zeocin contained ypds plates , it was indicated that the colonies on ypds plates containing zeocin was transformed with ppiczαamy successfully. the resulted recombinant strain containing both fungal glucoamylase and α-amylase was designated as km71/9kgla-zαamy.

high-level expression of glucoamylase and α-amylase in p. pastoris
after induction at 30°c, 230 rpm for 96 h, the supernatants of km71/9kgla, km71/zαamy and km71/9kgla-zαamy all had a clear band between  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda , while the supernatant of negative controls showed no band. the highest protein concentration of supernatant of km71/9kgla-zαamy was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg ml− <dig>  which was increased 23% compared to that of km71/9kgla , and was greatly increased 298% compared to that of km71/zαamy . the protein concentration of supernatant of negative controls were zero. figure  <dig> illustrates the marked increase in activity. km71/9kgla-zαamy achieved the highest saccharogenic activity  of  <dig> u ml− <dig>  which was improved by 79% compared to that of km71/9kgla . the dextrinogenic activity  of km71/9kgla-zαamy has a maximum activity of  <dig> u ml− <dig> and was improved by 183% compared to that of km71/zαamy . no amylase activity was detected in the original p. pastoris host.figure  <dig>

recently, special attention was paid to thermostable glucoamylase-producing fungi, but low yield and low activity have always been the bottleneck for their industrial application. the maximum activity of thermostable glucoamylases from streptosporangium sp.  <cit>  and humicola grisea var. ihermoidea  <cit>  and thermomyces lanuginosus  <cit>  were only  <dig> u ml− <dig>   <dig> u ml− <dig> and  <dig> u ml− <dig> respectively.

and the glucoamyalse and α-amylase activity of crude enzyme produced by r. pusillus gx- <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig> u ml− <dig> respectively. while the glucoamylase activity  of km71/9kgla and km71/9kgla-zαamy increased by  <dig> and  <dig> times respectively compared to r. pusillus gx- <dig>  it indicated that in our study, the two enzymes which heterologously expressed in p. pastoris showed potential application in starch degradation.

purification and properties of recombinant glucoamylase and α-amylase
the recombinant glucoamylase and α-amylase were purified by ammonium sulfate, and then submitted to sds-page analysis. the clear single band in figure 1b and c indicated that the single step was sufficient for purification of obtained enzymes.

the recombinant rpgla was purified  <dig> -fold with homogeneity and a recovery of 39%. the recombinant rpamy was purified  <dig> -fold with homogeneity and a recovery of 38%. the specific activity of purified rpgla and rpamy were  <dig> u mg− <dig>  and  <dig> u mg− <dig> .

based on the gel filtration of purified recombinant rpgla , there were two absorbance peaks corresponding to mw  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda respectively. while treated with boiling, the previous absorbance peak became smaller obviously . according to the sds-page analysis , rpgla showed single band with estimated molecular weight of 45 ~  <dig>  kda, and the theoretical molecular weight of rpgla was about 57 kda. therefore, the recombinant rpgla was inferred to be a dimer with a mw of  <dig>  kda.

the recombinant rpamy showed the same phenomenon as rpgla. two absorbance peaks corresponding to mw  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda respectively were presented . after boiled in water, the previous absorbance peak became much smaller . in view of the sds-page analysis, rpamy showed single band with estimated molecular weight of 45 ~  <dig>  kda, and the theoretical molecular weight of rpamy was about 50 kda. therefore, the recombinant rpamy was deduced to be a dimer with a mw of  <dig>  kda.

when submitted the translated amino acid sequence of rpgla and rpamy to prediction of disulfide bond, little possibility of presence of disulfide bond was showed. so the dimer may be as a result of hydrophobic and polar interaction and be nonobligatory  <cit> .

lane  <dig> and lane  <dig> in figure 1d showed the deglycosylated recombinant rpamy and rpgla respectively. the molecular weight of both recombinant proteins became a little smaller as a result of deglycosylation. according to the prediction results of glycosylation sites on netnglyc  <dig>  , rpgla and rpamy have  <dig> and  <dig> potential n-glycosylation sites respectively. so, rpgla and rpamy expressed in phichia pastoris were glycoproteins.

the rpgla and rpamy both exhibited activity in acidic conditions  with optimum at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   respectively, and were stable in a wide range of ph  <dig> - <dig>  . the optimal temperature for both enzymes was 70°c . the rpgla and rpamy showed relative good stability at 60°c. the residual activity of rpgla and rpamy were 73%  and 85% , respectively, when incubated at 60°c for 30 min. the half-life  of rpgla and rpamy at 60°c were 164 min and 75 min respectively according to calculation based on kinetics of thermal deactivation of enzymes.figure  <dig>

one of the main problems with regard to the industrial application of fungal glucoamylase is the relatively low thermal stability  <cit> , like commercially available aspergillus niger glucoamylase. here, the thermal stabilities of rpgla and rpamy were greatly higher than most other fungal amylases  <cit> , making them a great potential for starch hydrolysis procedures.

kanlayakrit et al.  <cit>  have reported the purification and characterization of raw-starch-digesting glucoamylase from thermophilic rhizomucor pusillus. the optimal temperature and ph were 65°c,  <dig>  respectively, which were similar to the characteristics of rpgla in this work. however, in kanlayakrit’s work, the activity of crude enzyme preparation was  <dig>  u ml− <dig> and the specific activity was  <dig>  u mg− <dig>  which were both much lower than that of rpgla. besides, as it is very common to have more than one glucoamylases in a fungus, thus it requires further study to explore whether the glucoamylase studied by kanlayakrit was the same with rpgla.

considering the similar biochemical properties of rpgla and rpamy, one clear advantage was that the two enzymes could perform their best at the same condition. consequently, we firstly co-expressed the glucoamylase with α-amylase in p. pastoris and exploit synergism in starch degradation. as described above, both saccharogenic activity and dextrinogenic activity were significantly enhanced by employing co-expression. meanwhile, the excellent productivity of two enzymes in one host would provide cost reduction in fermentation, purification, and substantial savings in energy consumption. note that the saccharogenic activity did not increase proportionally to the increase amount of recombinant α-amylase, it may ascribed to the fact that adding a few α-amylase into glucoamylase could facilitate the degradation of starch  <cit> . since α-amylase hydrolyzes internal α- <dig>   <dig> glycosidic bond of starch randomly, providing more nonreducing chain ends, which could serve as substrate of glucoamylase, so the saccharogenic activity increased substantially.

furthermore, according to the hydrolysis result  of different starch catalyzed by the enzyme preparation, the saccharogenic activities towards all selected substrates were greatly enhanced by co-expression. therefore, co-expression of the rpgla and rpamy demonstrated advantages in liquefaction of different starch and other carbohydrate.table  <dig>

analysis of hydrolysis products
according to hplc analysis result , the main products of soluble starch hydrolyzed by purified rpgla were glucose  and maltose  with no detection of other oligosaccharides. utilizing purified rpamy as catalyst, the main products were maltose  and glucose   with no detectable maltotriose and maltotetraose. however, the main products hydrolyzed by purified mixed enzyme preparation of km71/9kgla-zαamy were glucose  and maltose  with no detectable of maltotriose and maltotetraose .figure  <dig>

no extra peaks except glucose were detected up to 24 h of incubation even at high concentration  , which meant that the recombinant rpgla did not show any transglycosylation activity on glucose. usually, transglycosylation activity of glucoamylase will lead to the formation of oligosaccharides from glucose with condensation reaction  <cit> .

therefore, the enhancement of hydrolysis reaction of recombinant glucoamyalse after adding recombinant α-amylases may owe to increased quantity of oligosaccharides and maltose that catalyzed by α-amylase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a novel fungal glucoamylase and the α-amylase genes were cloned from rhizomucor pusillus, and expressed successfully in pichia pastoris. the two recombinant enzymes have similar characteristics with optimal ph of  <dig>   and  <dig>   respectively and optimal temperature as high as 70°c, thus the operating range in terms of ph, temperature and compatibility with other enzymes all improved. when co-expressing rpgla with rpamy, the amylase activity improved significantly, and was much higher than most other thermostable fungal glucoamylases and α-amylases. the improved amylase activity through co-expressing glucoamylase with α-amylase in p. pastoris is first reported in this paper. therefore, the work we did may offer an effective method to prepare high-activity biocatalyst. meanwhile, the outstanding biochemical properties indicate emerging and promising application of r. pusillus glucoamyalse and α-amylase.
