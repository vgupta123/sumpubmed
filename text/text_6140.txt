BACKGROUND
campylobacter species are a major cause of food-borne disease in the developed and the developing world. over 80% of human cases are caused by campylobacter jejuni and around 10% by campylobacter coli, with the remaining human cases caused by other campylobacter species. the species c. jejuni and c. coli are considered to be commensals of birds, domestic pets and livestock, but they have also been isolated from other sources including water, molluscs, bank voles and milk  <cit> . disease in humans is most frequently associated with the consumption of contaminated poultry  or porcine products   <cit> .

some past studies have begun to define the metabolic requirements of c. jejuni,  <cit> , yet there is still a paucity of information regarding the metabolic flexibility of this bacterium, which is able to survive in such a wide range of environmental niches. it is well recognised that amino acids are important carbon and energy sources for c. jejuni, both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and proline are the most common amino acids found in chicken faeces  <cit>  and are therefore possible nutrient sources for c. jejuni in the chicken gut. c. jejuni preferentially metabolises amino acids in a specific order: serine, aspartatic acid, asparagine and then glutamic acid. proline can also be metabolised, but only after other nutrients have been exhausted  <cit> .

campylobacter species were considered to be asaccharolytic and thus unable to metabolise glucose or other carbohydrates due to the absence of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase of the embden-meyerhof-parnas  pathway and incomplete pentose phosphate  and entner doudoroff  pathways  <cit> . however, it was recently shown that a novel l-fucose pathway including l-fucose permease is present within a genomic island in certain strains of c. jejuni  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that some c. jejuni strains can metabolise the sugar l-fucose. furthermore, stahl and co-workers found that fucose transport in c. jejuni in vivo provided these strains with a competitive advantage during colonisation of the piglet infection model  <cit> . however, there have been no subsequent reports of c. jejuni carbohydrate metabolism.

citric acid cycle intermediates such as pyruvate, fumarate, oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate and malate have been reported as energy sources for c. jejuni  <cit> . in addition, c. jejuni has been reported to metabolise short-chain fatty acids   <cit> . acetate, propionate and butyrate are the most significant anion or salt derivatives of scfas that are produced as metabolic by-products from the gut microbiota  <cit> .

the capacity for campylobacter species to survive and thrive in a wide range of environmental niches is underpinned by the ability of the bacteria to utilise the different metabolites that are available in the various hosts and environments. in contrast to the c. jejuni studies described above, very little is known about the metabolic requirements of c. coli. in this study, we aimed to characterise the metabolic profile of both c. jejuni and c. coli in order to see differences in their carbon utilisation capabilities. we used a diverse panel of clinical strains isolated from uk, pakistan and thailand, representing both the developed and developing world . from our analysis we have identified a phenotypic method and two genotypic methods for distinguishing between c. jejuni and c. coli.table  <dig>

RESULTS
carbon utilisation profiles of c. jejuni and c. coli strains reveal core and variable metabolites
we initially selected  <dig> human c. jejuni isolates and two human c. coli isolates to assess their metabolic profiles. using biolog pm <dig> and pm <dig> carbon utilisation plates, we identified the core  and differential carbon sources  utilised by a diverse panel of  <dig> c. jejuni and two c. coli strains . the omnilog software  generates a reading every  <dig> mins corresponding to the conversion of the redox dye used in the assay and hence respiration levels. the entire experiment was repeated at least in triplicate for each strain. the mean values of the experimental replicates for each strain for each carbon substrate were compared by one way anova and tukey multiple comparison of means using a 95% family-wise confidence level. statistical significance was assigned at the p <  <dig>  level . core carbon sources included the amino acids l-aspartic acid, l-asparagine, l-proline and l-serine. citric acid cycle intermediate succinic acid and its derivative bromo-succinic acid were used by all strains. d,l malic acid, fumaric acid and methyl pyruvic acid were also metabolised by all of the strains. when d-malic acid was used as a sole carbon source it was only utilised by c. jejuni strains and not by the two c. coli strains tested. lactic acid, butyric acid and d-lactic acid methyl ester were utilised by all strains while formic acid was utilised by  <dig> of the  <dig> strains tested.table  <dig>

the carbon sources that are core to all the strains have been highlighted in bold.



differential carbon sources  included the carbohydrate l-fucose, supporting recent reports that some strains of c. jejuni are able to utilise carbohydrates  <cit> . we found differential metabolism of the amino acids l-glutamine, glycyl-l-glutamic acid and glycine-l-proline and citric acid cycle intermediates alpha-keto-glutaric acid, citric acid, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, tricarballyic acid. the metabolic profiles of all the strains can be found in additional file  <dig>  finally, the scfa propionic acid, was metabolised by both c. coli strains tested  but was not metabolised by any of the c. jejuni strains .

whole-genome sequencing reveals genes encoding propanoate metabolism enzymes in c. coli that are absent from c. jejuni
to identify the genetic basis for propionic acid metabolism in c. coli, we sequenced the genomes of two c. coli strains . data from these whole-genome shotgun projects have been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accessions ayko <dig> and aykn <dig>  the versions described in this paper are version ayko <dig> and aykn <dig>  we used the rast webserver  <cit>  to examine the presence or absence of enzymes in the propanoate metabolism pathway  for c. jejuni strains nctc  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  and c. coli strains k <dig> and k <dig> and found that genes encoding propionate-coa ligase  and 2-methyl-citrate synthase  were present in the genomes of both c. coli strains but were absent from the c. jejuni genome sequences .figure  <dig>

and

. each box stands for an enzyme in the propanoate metabolism pathway. the yellow boxes indicate the ortholog genes shared by both c. jejuni and c. coli  while the green boxes indicates those genes present only in c. coli strains .



to assess whether the presence or absence of propionate-coa ligase and 2-methyl-citrate synthase genes could be used to distinguish c. coli from c. jejuni, we next searched the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide sequence database  <cit>  for similar sequences using blastn  <cit> . we also performed these searches against the  <dig> publicly available complete and draft c. coli genome sequences in refseq  <cit> . homologues of propionate-coa ligase and 2-methyl-citrate synthase genes were identified in all  of the c. coli genomes interrogated and with a minimum of 99% identity across the entire gene sequences. in contrast, when the  <dig> publicly available c. jejuni complete and draft genomes were interrogated we did not identify genes that could encode propionate-coa ligase or 2-methyl-citrate synthase.

a pcr assay for the propionate-coa ligase or  <dig> methyl-citrate-synthase genes can be used to distinguish c. coli from c. jejuni
an amino acid sequence alignment of propionate-coa ligase and 2-methyl-citrate-synthase from c. coli revealed that these proteins are highly conserved across six randomly selected c. coli isolates . pcr amplification of the propionate-coa ligase or 2-methyl-citrate synthase genes using c. coli or c. jejuni template dna generated amplicons of the expected size from all  <dig> strains of c. coli tested. in contrast, amplicons were not generated using template dna from  <dig> of  <dig> strains of c. jejuni tested. the single isolate  that generated pcr amplicons was subsequently shown to give a negative reaction in the hippurate hydrolysis assay, indicating that this strain had been incorrectly assigned as c. jejuni. therefore, 100%  of the c. jejuni strains failed to yield amplicons. positive-control pcr assays for the housekeeping gene glta  generated amplicons from all of the c. jejuni and c. coli isolates tested.

propionic acid as a sole carbon source allows differential identification of c. coli and c. jejuni
to determine whether c. coli and c. jejuni differed in their ability to utilise propionic acid as a sole carbon source in culture medium, we tested a panel of  <dig> environmental and clinical c. coli strains and  <dig> c. jejuni strains in biolog phenotypic microarray plates containing propionic acid as the sole carbon source. no or weak propionic utilisation was seen in all c. jejuni strains tested while strong propionic utilisation was seen for all c. coli strains tested. the mean values of the experimental replicates for each strain were compared using a unpaired t test with welch’s correction. statistical significance was assigned at p <  <dig>  level indicating a difference between propionic utilisations by c. jejuni and c. coli. figure  <dig> shows levels of propionic acid utilisation by c. jejuni and c. coli strains.figure  <dig>

discussion
campylobacter species are fastidious bacteria, exhibiting significant metabolic restrictions compared to other enteropathogenic bacteria. the principal energy sources for c. jejuni are amino acids, citric acid cycle intermediates and short-chain fatty acids  <cit> . despite these metabolic limitations, campylobacter species can survive in a wide range of environmental niches suggesting metabolic flexibility. to date, only a few laboratory adapted strains have been used to study the metabolic diversity of campylobacter species. in this study, we examined the extent of the metabolic diversity of c. jejuni and c. coli recently isolated from cases of disease.

the catabolism of amino acids by c. jejuni not only provides a carbon source but also protects bacteria from osmotic and oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, catabolism of particular amino acids can confer tissue-specific advantages for c. jejuni colonisation  <cit> . hofreuter and co-workers showed that serine supports growth of c. jejuni in murine intestinal and liver tissue, whereas proline and glutamine support growth in the intestine but not the liver  <cit> . they also showed that two c. jejuni strains  were unable to utilise serine in vitro even though they showed no genetic variation in l-serine dehydratase  and the serine transporter sdac. we have shown in this study that l-serine was utilised by all  <dig> c. jejuni tested. amino acids that were differentially utilised by the c. jejuni and c. coli strains included l-glutamine, and glutamic acid. this difference in the metabolic profiles of c. jejuni and c. coli isolates may indicate adaptation of these strains to different niches and reflect niche specific requirements for amino acids as a nutrient source, such as those reported for staphylococcus aureus and francisella novicida  <cit> .

previous studies have concluded that except for a few strains that are able to utilise the carbohydrate l-fucose  <cit> , campylobacter are asaccharolytic. one of the strains shown in previous studies  <cit>  to utilise fucose was c. jejuni strain nctc  <dig>  in our study, we found that strain nctc  <dig> was unable to respire using this carbon source. other workers have reported differences in strains of nctc  <dig> which may account for this phenotype  <cit> . furthermore, in a previous study it has been shown that oxidation of some substrates was greater at 42°c than 37°c. this may account for the lack of l-fucose utilisation seen here  <cit> . the ability of some strains of c. jejuni to utilise l-fucose is reportedly associated with the colonisation of pigs, but not poultry  <cit> . the two c. coli strains we tested using the biolog assay were both able to utilise l-fucose. as c. coli is predominately found in pigs, our findings support the suggestion  <cit>  that fucose availability in the pig intestine influences the bacterial fitness of c. coli colonisation in this host.

from our study, we found that none of the c. jejuni isolates tested were able to metabolise propionic acid while both c. coli strains were able to metabolise this carbon source. this appears to be linked to the presence of propanoate-coa ligase and 2-methyl-synthase genes in c. coli and their absence in c. jejuni. our studies further showed that the absence or presence of these genes is a reliable marker for the identification of c. jejuni or c. coli. the power of this test was confirmed by our finding that strain mb <dig> has been erroneously identified as c. jejuni; this strain tested positive for these two marker genes and our subsequent investigations showed that this was a strain of c. coli.

propionic acid is the most abundant of four scfa measured in pig manure  <cit>  and levels of propionate have been reported to be high in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs, one of the natural hosts for c. coli  <cit> . competition for nutrients in the gut is fierce and so the ability to use a potentially toxic metabolic waste product as an energy source may confer c. coli with a selective advantage when colonising the pig gastrointestinal tract.

campylobacterioisis is the principal cause of bacterial diarrhoeal disease in humans and c. jejuni and c. coli are the most common aetiological agents of human campylobacteriosis. the epidemiology of campylobacter infections in humans is poorly characterised in low income countries  <cit> . the true incidence of c. coli is difficult to estimate due to the difficulties in distinguishing campylobacter species. c. jejuni can be distinguished from other campylobacter species on the basis of the hydrolysis of hippurate for which c. jejuni gives only a positive reaction. however, hippurate negative c. jejuni strains have occasionally been reported  <cit> . mass spectrometry has also been used to discriminate between campylobacter species c. coli, c. jejuni, c. helveticus, c. lari, c. sputorum and c. upsaliensis using species identifying biomarkers  <cit> . however, these methods are time consuming and require complex equipment. often additional confirmatory tests based upon pcr amplification of a range of genes are needed  <cit> . for example klena et al., describes a multiplex pcr test to distinguish between c. jejuni, c. coli, c. coli, c. lari and c. upsaliensis using the lipid a gene lpxa with good species identification.

CONCLUSIONS
methods that distinguish species of campylobacter need to be developed in order to understand environmental aspects of campylobacter epidemiology, the emergence of atypical campylobacter species, emerging clinical aspects of disease, the association of campylobacter species with their natural hosts and emerging trends in antibiotic resistance. we have presented a molecular method that allows for accurate discrimination of the two predominant species associated with human disease. in addition, we have identified the basis for a selective media that would permit rapid discrimination of c. jejuni and c. coli that would be suitable for use in diagnostic and reference laboratories around the world. the importance of identifying c. coli from c. jejuni correctly from both environmental and clinical sources would help broaden our understanding of the distribution, prevalence, geographical spread and transmission of this human pathogen.
