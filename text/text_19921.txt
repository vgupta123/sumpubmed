BACKGROUND
bovine respiratory disease  is a major disease problem for the cattle industry, causing huge economic losses; research on brd has been a longstanding global priority. while the aetiology is multifactorial, infectious agents are important in the development of disease. the important infectious causes of brd include viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma  <cit> . aside of infectious causes, stress and environmental factors such as weaning, temperature, stocking density, dust, humidity, transportation and inadequate nutrition are also important co-factors in development of disease  <cit> . in economic terms, brd leads to decreased production, higher levels of mortality and morbidity, increased veterinary and labour costs and reduced carcass value  <cit> .

the primary viral respiratory pathogens are bovine herpesvirus- <dig> , bovine respiratory syncytial virus , and bovine parainfluenza type  <dig>   <cit> . while usually considered a respiratory pathogen, infection with bohv- <dig> can also cause abortion in pregnant cattle  <cit> . infection with these viruses can also facilitate invasion of opportunistic secondary pathogens such as mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus somni and a number of mycoplasma species such as m. bovis and m. dispar  <cit> . on farms where bovine viral diarrhoea virus  is not well controlled, this can lead to immunosuppression and influence the progression of brd. permanent lung damage can result following an episode of brd, making animals more susceptible to subsequent episodes of respiratory disease compromising growth rates and economic returns for the farmer  <cit> .

irrespective of the infectious agent involved, the presenting clinical signs of brd can appear similar. moreover, the detection of bacterial pathogen can mask an underlying viral cause; virus isolation may not always be successful and alternative methods of detection like ifat can lack sensitivity and specificity compared to molecular detection methods. single target  pcr assays require separate amplification of each target and can be expensive, inefficient and resource intensive where multiple pathogen detection is necessary. in this scenario, multiplex pcr has a significant advantage, as it permits simultaneous detection of several viruses in a single reaction mixture, facilitating cost-effective diagnosis  <cit> . real time pcr can provide rapid results for the clinical virologist with a reduced risk of contamination, and can detect, differentiate and provide a quantitative result for many different targets without any single target influencing the detection of the others  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to develop a simple, sensitive, specific, rapid and cost effective mrt-qpcr method for the detection of brsv, bohv- <dig> and bpi <dig> in clinical samples. the assay was compared to the conventional methods of virus isolation and fat to assess its application in routine diagnosis of the aetiological agents involved in brd.

RESULTS
integrity of clinical material
a Î²-actin signal was detected in all clinical samples tested in the mrt-qpcr indicating no evidence of extraction failure or pcr inhibition.

specificity of the mrt-qpcr
the performance of the mrt-qpcr on the virus panel demonstrated neither non-specific reactions nor any inter-assay cross amplification. on well characterised archived isolates for each of the viruses , only the intended target virus was amplified by the mrt-qpcr.

sensitivity of the mrt-qpcr
a ten-fold serial dilution of each of the in vitro transcribed rnas was tested in triplicate and the mrt-qpcr assay compared to the same template using the mono-specific assay; similar cp values were obtained for both formats. the standard curves obtained from the mrt-qpcr and mono-specific assay are shown in figure  <dig> a, b, c, d. there was no appreciable difference in the mean cp values of the mono-specific assay and the mrt-qpcr assay for bohv- <dig>  brsv and bpi <dig>  the estimates of cp values  that corresponds to 97% diagnostic test sensitivity conditional on virus copy numbers and test methods for each virus are presented in table  <dig>  as observed for the standard curve, the cp values for the mono-specific assay and the mrt-qpcr assays were very similar and hence both assays may be regarded as equally sensitive for diagnostic purpose. these results confirmed that the mrt-qpcr could achieve sensitivity of 97% with cp values in the range of 31- <dig> when the samples included  <dig> viral genome copy numbers for all targets; a similar sensitivity was shown with cp values in the range of 34- <dig> for  <dig> viral genome copy numbers. moreover, the efficiency of the pcr reaction and the detection limits of each target virus were not compromised by multiplexing the reaction .

a for each virus, a 10-fold dilution series is shown with the mean cp values. the lowest level of detection is shown, as are the two 10-fold dilutions immediately prior to the lowest level of detection. each dilution series was tested four times in triplicate. the estimates of the mean cut-off cp value for a test sensitivity of 97% and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were obtained using a bootstrap sampling procedure .

simultaneous detection of multiple virus targets
the template mixture of ten-fold serial dilutions of the four in vitro transcribed virus targets was tested in triplicate by mrt-qpcr assay. all four targets were detected and no evidence of cross reactivity between primers and probes or any reduction in sensitivity was observed.

analysis of clinical samples
the performance of the mrt-qpcr assay in clinical material was evaluated on several different sample types including swabs, fresh and fixed tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage samples; further, a small number of tissue culture supernatants  derived from clinical samples were included . results of ifat and virus isolation were not available for all  <dig> samples. this is because the testing was targeted depending upon the decisions made by individual private veterinary surgeons and diagnosticians at external veterinary laboratories submitting the material. ifat was performed on  <dig> samples for bohv- <dig>   <dig> samples for brsv and  <dig> samples for bpi <dig>  virus isolation was carried out on  <dig> samples.

a list of clinical material positive for brsv, bpi <dig> and bohv- <dig> is shown.

bohv- <dig> nucleic acid was detected as a single agent by the mrt-qpcr in 48/ <dig> samples, brsv rna in 28/ <dig> samples and bpi <dig> i rna in 14/ <dig> samples; co-infection with bohv- <dig> and bpi <dig> i was observed in  <dig> samples. while bpi <dig> ii had been detected previously, it was not identified during this study period.

of the  <dig> samples in which bohv- <dig> nucleic acids were detected, bohv- <dig> was also identified in  <dig> by ifat. bohv- <dig> was isolated from  <dig> samples, including  <dig> samples positive by ifat; in  <dig> samples bohv- <dig> was isolated but not detected by ifat. in addition, ifat detected bohv- <dig> in  <dig> samples where bohv- <dig> was not detected by the mrt-qpcr or by virus isolation; this likely indicates poorer specificity of the ifat for bohv- <dig>  bohv- <dig> was not detected in the remaining samples tested by either ifat  or virus isolation .

of the  <dig> samples in which brsv rna was detected, brsv was detected in eight samples by fat; brsv was not detected by virus isolation in any sample. brsv is difficult to detect by virus isolation as infectivity is rapidly lost outside the host. brsv was not detected in any of the remaining samples by fat .

of the  <dig> samples in which bpi3i rna was detected, bpi <dig> was detected in  <dig> by virus isolation; but in none of the  <dig> samples tested by ifat.

repeatability
the estimates of repeatability standard deviation  and relative standard deviation of repeatability  of uniplex and multiplex assays for different viruses are presented in table  <dig>  the multiplex assay showed slightly higher estimates of sdr and rsdr than the uniplex assay for all viruses. the estimates of sdr in uniplex assays ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  while for multiplex assays they ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the estimates of rsdr  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for uniplex and multiplex assays respectively. in general, estimates of sdr and rsdr for both assays were within the acceptable range of a standard diagnostic test .

to further investigate the reproducibility and performance of this assay on clinical materials, twenty positive and negative samples each for brsv and bohv- <dig> and fourteen positive and negative samples of bpi <dig> i by multiplex assay were randomly selected. these samples were re-tested in parallel by both mono-specific and mrt-qpcr assays. both assay formats identified the appropriate target and the results matched the original mrt-qpcr test result.

discussion
the mrt-qpcr is a rapid and efficient method for the detection and differentiation of brsv, bohv- <dig> and bpi <dig> and is thus an invaluable tool in the aetiological resolution of brd. aside of multiple pathogen detection, the assay has several advantages over conventional methods including higher sensitivity and specificity, decreased cost, smaller sample size, rapidity of processing and the possibility of laboratory automation to suit high throughput veterinary diagnostic laboratories. the multiplex format showed complete concordance with the corresponding mono-specific rt-pcrs. the application of mrt-qpcr for the detection of multiple pathogens provides a major contribution to efficiency, logistics, and cost-effectiveness of molecular diagnostics  <cit> .

a multiplex real time rt-pcr has been reported previously for bvdv , bohv- <dig>  and bpi <dig>   <cit> . while bvdv can be important in the development of brd, brsv is a primary pathogen and is thus included in the mrt-qpcr described herein. the use of shorter length mgb and lna probes is advantageous, typically confering stability, target specificity, greater sensitivity and discrimination for the target gene  <cit> .

as co-infections are a regular feature of brd in field outbreaks  <cit> , careful optimisation is required to ensure that the molecular diagnostic test employed will not detect one target virus preferentially. primers and probes for multiplex assays should be assessed both in silico and in vitro for evidence of cross amplification, competition or inhibition. the mrt-qpcr assay described here can detect viral co-infections both in technical validation experiments and in clinical samples. no cross reactivity between primers and probes was observed, nor was a reduction in sensitivity detected.

the sensitivity of the multiplex and uniplex assay was evaluated by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed rnas for brsv, bohv- <dig> and bpi <dig> i and ii. the sensitivity, efficiency and detection limits of the individual rt-qpcrs were not affected by multiplexing the reactions. the standard curves and reaction efficiencies were very similar for the mrt-qpcr and mono-specific reactions . a perfect amplification reaction has an efficiency of  <dig>  but in reality, reactions often have efficiencies of less than2; the acceptable range is considered to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the efficiencies obtained for both assays in this study were within this range.

for brsv and bpi <dig>  all samples in which these viruses were detected by other methods were detected by the mrt-qpcr. additionally, the mrt-qpcr identified brsv and bpi3i in  <dig> and  <dig> additional samples respectively, suggesting a higher sensitivity. for bohv- <dig>  this was the case for virus isolation and for the majority of fat positive samples. however, three samples were positive on bohv- <dig> fat but negative on both virus isolation and mrt-qpcr; this suggests a lack of specificity in the fat; further, the mrt-pcr identified bohv- <dig> in  <dig> additional samples when compared to fat results, suggesting higher sensitivity. the mrt-qpcr also detected dual infections  in three samples; in virus isolation of these samples, bohv- <dig> overgrew bpi <dig>  masking detection. these results demonstrate that the m rt-qpcr is more specific and sensitive in respiratory viral diagnosis when compared to conventional tests, as has been shown in both veterinary and human clinical pathology settings  <cit> .

false negative results can occur due to rt- pcr inhibition, which was controlled in this sample set by the use of an endogenous internal control . while this assay was run separately, it would be possible to consider including this control in the multiplex reaction by, for example, labelling both subgenotypes of bpi <dig> with the same fluorophore. the selection of target sequences is also critical factor that can contribute to false negatives; it is possible  that mutations in the primer and probe regions may occur which compromise molecular detection at the target site . while sequences for molecular assays are selected in silico to ensure the target region is highly conserved, unusual or unexpected results from clinical samples should always trigger further investigation by either conventional methods or use of molecular assays with different target sequences or degenerate primers.

a final advantage of the use of molecular based testing in a clinical setting is the ability to include other targets e.g. as adenovirus, bvdv and bacterial pathogens. the limitations of real time pcr based multiplex detection and differentiation rest with the number of reactions which can be optimised in a single tube and the number of fluorophores which can be simultaneously detected. while real time pcr platforms can generally detect no more than  <dig> fluorophores, labelling strategies can be used to increase the number of targets detected and the development of fluorophore labelled bead based detection systems  may extend target detection. currently, the aetiology of many brd outbreaks is undiagnosed, in some part due to the range of respiratory pathogens which must be sought and the cost of multiple pathogen detection by mono-specific assays. adding further pathogen targets to molecular assays should improve aetiologic identification in investigation of brd.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this mrt-qpcr assay is a sensitive and specific technique capable of detection of three major viral respiratory pathogens of cattle, and may have additional benefit when more than one agent is involved. although reagents for multiplex and real time pcr assays are traditionally considered expensive, the ability to perform these assays within a short time frame to detect multiple pathogens reduces hands-on time in the laboratory, is more efficient and can generate valuable information in differential diagnosis. additional cost benefits on farm will result from more rapid diagnosis and the ability to target treatment, use appropriate vaccines or implement improved management procedures quickly.
