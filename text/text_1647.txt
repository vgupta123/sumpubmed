BACKGROUND
s. enteritidis and s. typhimurium, as two main zoonotic and broad-host-range pathogens that cause human salmonellosis, have been frequently isolated from poultry and their products  <cit> . prevalence of salmonella differs between layers and broilers  <cit> . factors influencing the prevalence of chicken-associated salmonella are feeds and growth environment  <cit> , transportation process  <cit> , and chick sources  <cit> . moreover, age-associated prevalence has been reported in layers, maximal prevalence at  <dig> weeks before egg production and gradually decreases with aging  <cit> . in broiler the prevalence differed depending on sale sites from  <dig> % in slaughterhouses  <cit>  and up to nearly 100% in the open markets and supermarkets  <cit> .

appearance of monophasic variants such as in s. typhimurium   <cit>  increases the problem in serotyping. therefore, molecular methods have been developed to differentiate the serovars based on the nucleotide sequence variations in flagellar structural genes flic and fljb  <cit>  and pfge analysis  <cit> . prevalent serovars differ between chickens and ducks  <cit>  and are associated with chicken lines and geographic area  <cit> . in taiwan, we reported that salmonella serogroup c <dig> and b, especially s. typhimurium, were predominant salmonella in duck and geese  <cit> . in another study of duck, the prevalence of salmonella was  <dig> % and s. potsdam, s. dusseldorf, and s. indiana were the predominant serovars  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of salmonellae among different chicken sources and determined serotypes by pfge analysis first, followed by traditional agglutination test of each genotype. after characterizing antibiograms and genomic variations in chromosome and plasmid of chicken isolates, flagellar antigens of chicken and human isolates were compared to understand the common antigens possibly for transmission of salmonella between human and chicken.

methods
sample collection and enrichment
totally  <dig> chickens of 1-year-old broiler breeder, 1-day-old chicks  and 9-week-old chickens  of taiwan broiler chicken, 1-year-old layers and 3-week-old broiler were sampled by 108c amies agar gel - single plastic swab  from cloaca of each chicken fed at different farms in chiayi of taiwan from  <dig> to  <dig>  layers and broilers were fed in commercial cage and house farm respectively. the sampled swabs were grown in  <dig> ml of gram-negative broth  at 37°c for  <dig> h. over-night gn bacterial broth was streaked on xylose lysine deoxycholate  plates, which were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. black colonies were further examined by biochemical tests including triple sugar iron agar , christensen's urea agar , simmons' citrate agar , sulfide-indole-motility medium , voges-proskauer medium , moller's ornithine decarboxylase medium , lysine iron agar  and mobility-indole-ornithine agar  purchased from merck . at least two positive isolates from each plate were maintained on brain heart infusion agar . in addition, salmonellae from 9-week-old nhc in tainan  and pintung  at same period were also analyzed.

serogroup and serotype identification
salmonella-positive isolates were further serogrouped by the slide agglutination test with the use of o-antigen antiserum and serotyped by the tube agglutination test with the use of h-antigen antisera. both antisera were purchased from difco . in addition,  <dig> salmonellae were collected from  <dig> medical centers and district hospitals located throughout the countries from  <dig> to  <dig> and serotyped in the salmonella reference laboratory of centers for disease control , department of health, taiwan, with antisera purchased from s&a reagents lab , denka seiken , statens serum institut , and a local biotech company, ltk biolaboratories . phase induction was performed using a paper-bridged method developed in the laboratory of taiwan cdc  <cit> .

antimicrobial susceptibility test
each isolate was examined by disk diffusion method for its susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents including ampicillin , cefazolin , ceftriaxone , chloramphenicol , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprium , and tetracycline . in addition, resistance to three fluoroquinolones: flumequine  of limited spectrum quinolone and enrofloxacin  as well as ciprofloxacin  of broad spectrum quinolone. while single bacterial colony was taken into  <dig> ml of mueller-hinton broth  and cultured at 37°c for  <dig> hrs, bacterial broth was then adjusted to  <dig>  mcfarland and plated on mueller-hinton agar . antimicrobial disks  were plated onto mha agar and then incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hrs. susceptibility and resistance were determined according to the interpretation criteria to e. coli  established by clinical laboratory standards institute  standard  <cit> . multi-drug resistance  isolate is defined as that isolate resistance to two or more antibiotics belonging to different antibiotic classes.

plasmid and genotype analysis
plasmid dna pattern was determined by kado and liu method  <cit>  and purified plasmid dna was subjected to gel electrophoresis with  <dig> % seakem gtg agarose  at  <dig> v for  <dig>  hrs. genotypes of all isolates were determined by pfge analysis with restriction endonuclease xbai digestion. the procedure of pfge analysis was described earlier  <cit> . the digested dna was separated by chef mapper xa system  in  <dig>  × tbe at 14°c for  <dig> h with auto-algorithm model of 30- <dig> kb,  <dig> v/cm, switching interval  <dig> - <dig>  sec. the genotypes were defined as  <dig> band differences between two isolates  <cit> .

RESULTS
prevalent serogroups and serovars among chicken lines and locations
prevalence of salmonella differed between chicken lines  and ages from  <dig> % for chick and  <dig> % for nhc of taiwan broiler chicken .  <dig> salmonella isolates belonged to serogroup c <dig>  b, d, c2-c <dig>  e, and g in the decreasing order and the number of serogroups differed among  <dig> counties. further, region-specific serogroups were identified as serogroup g in chiayi, serogroup d in tainan, and serogroup c2-c <dig> and e in pintung . in chiayi, age-associated serogroups were found for serogroup c <dig> salmonella in chick group and serogroup b and g in nhc group .

a the number of each serogroup was determined in our laboratory by examination of salmonella isolated from cloacal samples of chicken in chiayi county and from surveillance of tainan and pintung county.

discussion
as one of main pathogen to cause foodborne diseases, salmonella has been frequently reported among different animal sources, especially more divergent salmonella serovars found in chickens  <cit> . with the limited serovars in  <dig> chicken isolates, serogroups c <dig>  d, e and g were restricted in one county and serogroup b and c <dig> were found in all three counties , suggesting possibly that serogroup b and c <dig> isolates may be more adapted to chicken. in human isolates, we found that the serovar number in each serogroup were not associated positively with the serogroup prevalence, such as highest serovar number in low prevalent serogroup c <dig> vs lower serovar number in high prevalent serogroup b and serogroup d . these results imply that serogroup c <dig> may occasionally infect human isolates. further, serovars are determined by flagellins: h <dig> and h <dig> antigens encoded by flic and fljb. as one of the most important immunogens, flagellin interacts with the toll-like receptor  <dig>  to activate nfκb pathway and proinflammatory genes to regulate innate and adaptive immune system  <cit> . however, aflagellar serovars s. pullorum and s. gallinarum cause more severe infection than flagellar serovars in chicken because of aflagellar s. typhimurium could avoid the tlr <dig> regulation of il-1β expression and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration in gut  <cit> . such evasion of tlr <dig> is critical for survival of flagellar bacteria at muscos  <cit> . [in the present study, we found that i of h <dig> antigen and lack of h <dig> antigen were the common antigens for all serogroups in human isolates . however, in comparing  <dig> chicken serovars and  <dig> human serovars of this study with serovars of chicken and human isolates from uk and usa, only s. enteritidis, s. typhimurium, s. albany, s. derby, s. anatum and s. havana were common in both hosts . however, these serovars shares same antigens: g complex; i; and z <dig> z <dig> of h <dig> antigen and  <dig> complex and - of h <dig> antigens , implying these antigens may be important for salmonella transmission between chicken and human.

prevalent serogroups and serovars are related to chicken lines  <cit>  and ages  <cit> . in layer, age-related prevalence was reported earlier  <cit>  and no salmonella was isolated from 1-year-old layers in the present study . such age-associated clearance may be due to stronger antigen-specific t-cell response in older chicken  <cit>  and not related to b-cell response  <cit> . age-related serovars were also identified in taiwan broiler chickens . almost all isolates were s. choleraesuis and non-typable salmonella  of serogroup c <dig> in chick group and s. mons of serogroup b in nhc group . as swine-adapted pathogen, s. cholearesuis has seldom reported from chicken. however, s. choleraesuis in 1-day-old chicks may be contaminated from the hatchery, particular from eggshell membrane; in which s. typhimurium, not s. choleraesuis, is main serovar  <cit> . if highly invasive s. choleraesuis could infect chicks and use the chicken as reservoir, it will lead to a public problem of circulating such high invasive serovar in animals. in broiler, prevalence of salmonella differed between chicken parts   <cit> . further, prevalent serovars differ between sampling sources e.g. the s. anatum and s. rissen in chicken meat  <cit>  and s. blockley, s. hadar and s. bredeney in the cecal samples .

several methods have been developed to differentiate clinical isolates. in this study, pfge patterns almost matched serotypes, although s. albany and s. havana appeared multiple genotypes with highly similar banding patterns . therefore, pfge typing is a useful tool to assist serotyping of salmonella isolates before doing traditional serotypes  <cit> . in contrast to pfge type, plasmid analysis is the most convenient method for subtyping  <cit> . in this study, plasmid variations were more diverse than genomic variations; however, s. albany and s. havana with highly genomic variations lacked plasmid . these results may imply that recent evolution of salmonella might be mainly through plasmid acquisition to introduce beneficial genes for host serovar to survival.

antimicrobial susceptibility of salmonella can be used to monitor drug abuse in different regions   <cit>  and animal sources  <cit> . early study reported that salmonella from chicken, not from human, pig and cattle, was less resistance to a, c, and sxt  <cit> . nevertheless, resistance to t was frequently found in chicken isolates  <cit> . since discovery of acssut-resistant region in sgi of s. typhimurium dt <dig>  <cit> , variations within sgi and complex integron in <dig> change the antimicrobial resistance  <cit> . in this study, our chicken isolates were highly resistant to antimicrobials a, c, s, sxt, t and ub . these results imply that s. albany, s. anatum, s. grmpian, s. hissar, s. kubacha, s. mons, and s. typhimurium with resistance types from h to m may be derived from misuse of antimicrobials or due to presence of sgi and/or integron  <cit> . mechanism to develop en and ci resistance is due to mutation in quinolone-resistance determining region or expression of efflux pump  <cit> . earlier, fluoroquinolone-resistant salmonella was seldom reported in poultry's isolates worldwide  <cit> . until recently, resistance to similar fluoroquinolones: en and ci has been reported from chicken in spain  <cit> . in contrast to same prevalence of resistance to en and ci in swine and human isolates  <cit> , we found that resistance rate to en was higher than that of ci . however, en and ci resistant isolates were only found in few serovars of serogroups b and c <dig> and mainly in pintung area . these results indicate that possibly en was misuse in pintung county to induce resistance in prevalent serovars.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> chicken serovars were identified and differed in drug resistance and prevalence associated with chicken lines, ages and regions. five serovars were common between these chicken serovars and  <dig> human serovars
