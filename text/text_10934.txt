BACKGROUND
in dicotyledonous plants, adventitious roots can be defined as roots that develop from organs such as leaves and stems under unusual circumstances. adventitious root formation  in leafy stem cuttings is a crucial physiological process for propagation of many ornamental plant species. despite intensive control of environmental factors in the modern propagation industry, high economic losses still occur as a result of insufficient rooting  <cit> . chrysanthemum , a plant of high ornamental value and economic importance, also suffers insufficient rooting of leafy stem cuttings. poor understanding of the mechanisms and the signals that control the development of adventitious root hampers the use of reliable technologies to improve arf of cuttings of ornamental plants.

adventitious rooting is known to be a quantitative genetic trait that is affected by multiple endogenous and environmental factors. one of the endogenous factors known to play a key role in the control of arf is auxin. numerous authors established that auxin had the ability to promote adventitious root. pagnussat et al. demonstrate that nitric oxide mediates the auxin response leading the arf in cucumber  <cit> . the progressive accumulation and local concentration of auxin in the base of the cuttings seems to be important for starting the rooting process  <cit> . localized synthesis of abcb <dig> protein leads to enhanced iaa transport and local accumulation of iaa which drives arf  <cit> . auxin-dependent arf is possibly via h2o2– and nitric oxide-dependent cgmp signaling in mung bean seedlings  <cit>  or an involvement of crosstalk between the auxin and jasmonate regulatory pathways  <cit> .

there is increasing evidence that arf is also dependent on the action of ethylene  <cit> , production of which is caused by wounding during the cutting process. the role of ethylene in the arf has been examined in a variety of plant species, such as in pelargonium cuttings, preharvest endogenous carbohydrate status interacts with postharvest ethylene action to regulate arf  <cit> . recent studies in tomato have also identified a positive role for ethylene in arf with modulation of auxin transport as a central point of ethylene-auxin crosstalk  <cit> . overexpression of ptail <dig>  a transcription factor of the ap <dig>  increased number of adventitious roots in populus  <cit> .

wound responses associated with cutting excision are integrated and often necessary in the steps leading to adventitious root  <cit> . once excised from the stock plant, cuttings need to redistribute their remaining resources as soon as possible to form adventitious roots and restore the balance of source and sink, which enables resources to be passed between different parts of the plant. there is evidence that carbohydrate allocation and distribution within the cutting could be more important than the content itself  <cit> .

arf in petunia hybrida cuttings were defined as three metabolic phases, i.e., sink establishment phase, recovery phase, and maintenance phase  <cit> . during this complex process, many proteins work together to help the cutting survive. a proteomic analysis of different mutant genotypes of arabidopsis led to the identification of  <dig> proteins correlating with adventitious root development  <cit> .  <dig> differentially accumulated proteins during shoot-born root were identified in maize via esi ms/ms mass spectrometry  <cit> . however, how proteins play roles in arf of chrysanthemum cuttings remained unknown. in present study, we described the analysis of 2-de protein profiles, which is aimed to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying arf in chrysanthemum. compared to 0-day-old cutting bases,  <dig> protein spots showed significant variation.  <dig> protein spots were identified by maldi-tof/tof and assigned as  <dig> different types of protein of known function.  <dig> genes corresponding to these proteins were successfully cloned and analyzed by qrt-pcr. most of gene expression profiles were in accordance with the protein pattern. moreover, the changes in protein abundance of aco during arf are supported by western blot experiments. the present study gained a new insight on the proteins related to arf of chrysanthemum.

RESULTS
anatomy of arf in cutting bases of ‘jinba’
morphological and histological analyses were performed  to determine the time course of arf in the cutting bases of chrysanthemum. compared to 0-day-old cutting bases , in 5-day-old cutting bases some early adventitious root primordium with apical meristems and differentiation of the root body are visible under the microscope and from outside while adventitious roots are not yet initiated. for our subsequent proteomic analyses 5-day-old cutting bases have been chosen to compare the protein accumulation of 0-day-old cutting bases of chrysanthemum. in this way, proteins whose expression levels were changed during arf could be identified.

analysis of 2-de protein patterns of arf
after electrophoresis, the gels were stained with cbb r <dig> and analyzed using the pdquest software . in three independent experiments, there were  <dig> and  <dig> protein spots in the  <dig> d and  <dig> d groups, respectively, mainly in the range of ph 5– <dig> and relative molecular mass 18–116 kda. a total of  <dig> protein spots showed more than a 2-fold difference in expression values in 5-day-old cutting bases compared to the control 0-day-old ones . of which  <dig> protein spots were up-regulated,  <dig> out of  <dig> protein spots were exclusively accumulated in the 5-day-old cutting bases.  <dig> protein spots were down-regulated,  <dig> out of  <dig> protein spots disappeared in the  <dig> d group.

identification of differentially accumulated proteins
all the  <dig> spots from the 2-de gels  were cut out by hand and subjected to gel digestion using trypsin and maldi-tof/tof analysis. we used automated the mascot software to search the ncbi.nr database.  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially accumulated protein spots were confidently matched to ncbi database entries, but the remaining  <dig> protein spots were not confidently matched. this could be due to the lack of genomic information for the chrysanthemum. table  <dig> lists the accession numbers, molecular weights and possible molecular functions of all proteins identified.

proteins were considered to be differentially expressed if they showed at least a two-fold difference between the  <dig> and  <dig> d gels at p <  <dig>  in t-tests of three biological replicates.

functional annotation of the identified proteins
for the  <dig> protein spots identified via the annotated ncbinr database  a function could be immediately predicted. the proteins identified were assigned as  <dig> different types of protein, including  <dig> known proteins and  <dig> unknown proteins. since spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been identified as atp synthase beta subunit . spots  <dig> and  <dig> as malate dehydrogenase . spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as aldolase . spots  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase activase . spots  <dig> and  <dig> as temperature-induced lipocalin . spots  <dig> and  <dig> as 26 s protease regulatory subunit  <dig> b homolog . this could be due to post-translational modifications of the same gene product as one protein was found in different locations and very abundant proteins cannot be clearly separated, or that a protein can have different splice variants.

of the  <dig> proteins with known function, only  <dig> proteins were positively correlated with arf, including putative heterogeneous nuclearribonucleoprotein a <dig> , a predicted protein , glutamate dehydrogenase , and auxin-induced protein pcnt  <dig> , protein til  and ald .

the ald protein  out of the  <dig> proteins related to energy and carbon metabolism  were positively correlated with arf. spot  <dig>  was only appeared in 5-day-old cutting bases, and spot  <dig>  was up-regulated in 5-day-old cutting bases. ald may play an important role during arf in cutting bases of chrysanthemum.

gdh  related to nitrate assimilation and metabolism , was up-regulated in 5-day-old cutting bases. gdh contribute to both carbon skeleton supply  and ammonium assimilation in plants, and also plays an important role in metabolic acclimation of tobacco roots to boron deprivation  <cit> . thus, gdh is an important protein in meeting the nitrogen demand of cells during root formation in cuttings of chrysanthemum.

hnrnpa <dig> , which was linked to rna binding , up-regulated in 5-day-old cutting bases, has been reported that transcriptionally regulates smooth muscle cell differentiation gene expression and promotes neural crest cell migration and differentiation toward smooth muscle cells  <cit> . however, there has been no report of the functional involvement of hnrnpa <dig> in plant differentiation and development. in this study, we identified a potential role for hnrnpa <dig> in arf from chrysanthemum cutting bases.

adventitious root development in the cutting base of chrysanthemum involves the induction and repression of numerous genes in conjunction with changes in the levels of phytohormones . here we found changes in the expression of aco  and auxin-induced protein pcnt <dig>  in arf.

moreover, one of the interesting features was  <dig> proteins linked to photosynthesis  were negatively correlated with arf. chlorophyll a/b binding protein precursor , rca  and rubisco large subunit were down-regulated, while carbonic anhydrase isoform  <dig>  and magnesium-protoporphyrin ix methyltransferase , an enzyme in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway  <cit> , disappeared in the 5-day-old cutting bases during arf.

three proteins linked to protein fate  may regulate the protein degradation in arf. eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a isoform iii  and prs6b  were down-regulated at 5-day-old cutting bases, suggesting that protein synthesis was decreased, and eukaryotic release factor  <dig> homolog  was only accumulated on the 5-day-old cutting bases, which is consistent with the protein degradation during arf.

some protein negatively correlated with arf also could be identified. two proteins involved in stress response and defense : disease resistance protein rps <dig>  and til . arf of cuttings can be improved via conditioning of the donor plant, by application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> . rps <dig> declined during arf may good for pathogen infection which will help the development of adventitious roots of chrysanthemum.

one protein related to ascorbate biosynthesis , gdp-mannose  <dig> -epimerase . gme constitutes a control point for regulation of the ascorbate pathway in plants  <cit> . a possible control of root elongation by ascorbate via its action on peroxidases that are involved in the regulation of cell-wall extensibility  <cit> . the reason of down-regulation of gme on 5-day-old cutting bases may be that synthesis of ascorbic acid needs gme.

one protein related to lipid metabolism , stearoyl-acp desaturase . two proteins involved in cell-wall structure : xyloglucan endotransglucosylase  and actin depolymerizing factor .

the proteins identified in this study fell into eleven functional categories . the most abundant category of proteins at 23% was proteins that matched entries in the database with as yet unknown function. as it can be seen in figure  <dig>  of the proteins with known function, the most striking feature of this classification was the highest representation of proteins linked with carbohydrate and energy metabolism, which was in good accordance with sorin’s study  <cit> .

analysis of the identified proteins at the mrna level
to confirm the protein expression changes during arf observed in the 2-de gels, we checked their corresponding gene expression levels at 0-day-old and 5-day-old cutting bases of chrysanthemum using qrt-pcr.

the  <dig> identified protein spots were assigned as  <dig> different types of protein. eleven proteins including four known proteins  and  <dig> unknown proteins were not successfully cloned. twenty genes  corresponding to these proteins were cloned successfully according to our est database , and their expression patterns at  <dig> and 5-day-old cutting bases were investigated at the mrna level using qrt-pcr. the transcripts for the  <dig> spots  were in accordance with the protein pattern, while the mrna levels for  <dig> protein spots  were different from the protein pattern. for example, the levels of spot  <dig> and  <dig> of ald  were in accordance with the corresponding gene expression levels, while levels of spot  <dig> and  <dig> of ald protein  are contrast to their mrna levels. til protein, for spot  <dig>  the transcript level is consistent with the protein expression patterns of spot  <dig> , but not for the spot  <dig> . one possible explanation for this discrepancy between protein patterns and mrna levels could be that there may be post-transcriptional changes in those proteins in the chrysanthemum roots projecting epidermis process.

expression level of cmaco during arf
treatment with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid reduced lateral root formation in arabidopsis  <cit> , cmaco was of particular interest. to determine cmaco expression level and protein abundance during arf in the cutting bases of chrysanthemum, we used qrt-pcr and western blot technique. we established a new monoclonal antibody against the cmaco  and used it for the western blot detection. at the transcript level, cmaco expression was slightly decreased in 1-day-old cutting bases, then gradually increased from  <dig> to 4-day-old cutting bases, while with a rapid declined at 5-day-old cutting bases . western blots demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody to cmaco recognized acc oxidase from  <dig> d to 5-day-old cutting bases, showing a single band of the expected molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kd . cmaco showed an increase in the amount of protein from  <dig> to 4-day-old cutting bases, followed by a subsequent decrease at 5-day-old cutting bases. the expression of cmaco on the level of mrna and protein is strictly linear except that in 1-day-old cutting bases. compared with the control , the level of mrna is down-regulated but the level of protein is up-regulated in 1-day-old cutting bases. moreover, ethylene production during arf in chrysanthemum cutting bases was detected by gas chromatography. ethylene evolution was much higher than that of day  <dig>  a climactic peak was observed on 1-day-old cutting bases followed by a decrease till day  <dig> after cutting, rose again after day  <dig>  then decreased gradually on day  <dig> . ethylene synthesis inhibitor, agno <dig>  inhibited the arf of chrysanthemum . all these data suggest that cmaco is involved in arf of chrysanthemum.

discussion
2-de analysis confirmed that a number of proteins were correlated to arf, which is similar to the observations in arabidopsis and maize  <cit> . we could find some overlap among the protein identified here and the proteins described to be potentially associated with arf in arabidopsis  <cit> . this is the case of the ca <dig> , the aco , the aldoa  and the idh . we have shown that grafting improved rooting ability of chrysanthemum by altering several physiological aspects  <cit> .

carbohydrate and energy metabolism
respiration is the most important postharvest physiological process, so the fact that 19% of the proteins identified during the process of rooting are energy related is not surprising. among which, only ald  positively correlated to the arf. whereas, atpb , mdh , pgk , idh  and aldoa  were down-regulated.

interestingly, agreement with study in arabidopsis, the aldoa that was recently proposed to be negatively correlated to adventitious root number as well as to the free iaa content, and phosphoribulokinase were negatively correlated to adventitious root number  <cit> . the expression of ald, which may regulate the vacuolar h+-atpase mediated control of cell elongation that determines root length  <cit> . evidence showed an important role of the tca cycle in the coordination of photosynthetic and respiratory metabolisms of the illuminated leaf  <cit> , the possible role of idh, a tca cycle enzyme  <cit> , may play an important role in resources redistribution during arf.

atpb was identified as a novel plant cell death regulator in arabidopsis  <cit> . programmed epidermal cell death induced by ethylene occurred at the site of adventitious root emergence in rice  <cit> . thus, whether a decrease in atpb  triggered the cell death during arf of chrysanthemum remained to be studied.

photosynthetic
the down-regulation of some photosynthetic proteins is regulated by light. for example, ca is regulated by light at the mrna level  <cit> , and there are interactions between mitochondrial metabolism and photosynthetic carbon assimilation  <cit> . consequently, the down-regulation of proteins linked to photosynthesis and to the tca cycle  fits with the light hypersensitivity of arf.

protein fate
erf <dig> is responsible for the recognition of stop codons in mrnas during protein synthesis, but accumulating evidence indicates that erf <dig> functions in other processes in addition to translation termination. expression pattern of erf <dig> and cab  in arf of chrysanthemum is in agreement with overexpressing erf <dig> in arabidopsis during germination and early seedling development was accompanied by a dramatic reduction of cab  <cit> . this is reliable evidence to the 2-de protein profiles of arf in chrysanthemum.

hormone-related proteins
given the complexity role of ethylene in the rooting process, we are interested in the detailed mechanisms of aco  in the rooting process. adding acc to the rooting medium significantly inhibits rooting percentage  <cit> . some researchers have found that enhanced ethylene synthesis promoted the initiation of lateral root primordial  <cit> . the wound-induced increase in ethylene, seen within 3 h of production of the cuttings, is a key stimulatory factor in the formation of root primordial  <cit> . in mung bean hypocotyl cuttings, ethylene stimulated rooting by enhancing the increase in auxins  <cit> . applied acc both increased arf on vegetative stem cuttings from ethylene-insensitive never ripe tomato and wild-type plants, but never ripe tomato cuttings produced fewer adventitious roots than wild-type cuttings  <cit> . although a pearson correlation analysis indicated that aco non-significantly varied with arf in arabidopsis  <cit> . but in chrysanthemum, cmaco is highly induced till early adventitious root appeared, the ethylene evolution were higher than that on day  <dig> after cuttings. agno <dig> inhibited in vitro rooting in sweet orange indicating that ethylene was important for rhizogenesis  <cit> . similarly, the ethylene synthesis inhibitor, agno <dig>  inhibited the arf of chrysanthemum. in addition, our previous study showed that waterlogging triggers ethylene evolution, which in turn results in arf  <cit> . these data suggests that the function of aco is at least partially conserved among different plant species, and ethylene did contribute to the arf of chrysanthemum.

an interplay between ethylene and auxin in the process of arf in waterlogged tobacco, most likely on the level of polar auxin transport  <cit> . a higher auxin concentration was required for the induction phase of adventitious root but inhibited the formation phase in which anatomical changes take place  <cit> . we observed that auxin-induced protein pcnt <dig>  was present only in 5-day-old cutting bases and the transcript displayed higher expression correspondingly on day  <dig>  the auxin-induced protein pcnt <dig> is thought to belong to the aldo and keto reductase  family  <dig>  <cit> . gmakr <dig> in soybean showed a root-specific expression pattern and was inducible by the synthetic auxin analogue  <dig> -d, which appeared to be corroborated by the presence of root-specific and stress-response elements in its promoter region  <cit> . it inferred that auxin-induced protein pcnt <dig> is the most likely protein governing the formation of new roots in chrysanthemum. it will be our ongoing research topic.

CONCLUSIONS
the proteomic analysis of cutting bases of chrysanthemum allowed us to identify proteins whose expression was related to arf. we identified auxin-induced protein pcnt <dig> and cmaco positively or negatively correlated to arf, respectively. several other proteins related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism, protein degradation, photosynthetic and cell structure were also correlated to arf. the induction of protein cmaco provide a strong case for ethylene as the immediate signal for arf. this strongly suggests that the proteins we have identified will be valuable for further insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling arf.
