BACKGROUND
ack <dig> is a  <dig> kda non-receptor tyrosine kinase  with the domain arrangement shown in figure 1a. from n- to c-terminus, ack <dig> contains a sterile alpha motif  domain  <cit> , a kinase domain, an sh <dig> domain, a cdc42-binding domain , a clathrin-binding motif  <cit> , a region homologous to mig <dig>  <cit> , and a ubiquitin binding domain  <cit> . the c-terminal portion of ack <dig> also contains several proline-rich sequences that serve as protein-protein interaction motifs  <cit> . members of the ack family include human ack1/tnk <dig>  <cit> , tnk1/kos <dig> in human and mouse  <cit> , bovine ack <dig>  <cit> , dack and dpr <dig> in drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and ark- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . the isoforms share the overall domain arrangement of ack <dig> , but differ in some details. for instance, ack <dig> has a shorter n-terminal region and a shorter c-terminal portion  <cit> . the isoforms tnk <dig>  kos <dig> and dack do not have a crib domain and are shorter than ack <dig>  <cit> .

several proteins have been shown to interact with ack <dig>  gtp-bound cdc <dig> binds to the crib domain and activates ack <dig>  <cit> . ligands for the proline-rich region of ack <dig> include the sh <dig> domains of hck  <cit> , grb <dig>  <cit> , snx <dig>  <cit> , and the ww domain of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase nedd4- <dig>  <cit> . upon activation by cdc <dig>  ack <dig> phosphorylates the guanine exchange factor dbl  <cit>  and the adapter protein p130cas  <cit> . although the physiological roles of ack <dig> are still unclear, it has been implicated in several signaling pathways. ack <dig> is phosphorylated and activated in response to multiple growth factors  <cit>  and integrin-mediated signals  <cit> . ack <dig> participates in a signaling complex with egfr  <cit> . in addition, due to its interaction with proteins such as ubiquitin  <cit> , clathrin heavy chain  <cit>  and the sorting nexin sh3px <dig>  <cit> , ack <dig> is thought to play a role in the regulation of egfr stability and vesicle dynamics.

sam  domains are modular domains of ~ <dig> amino acids that were originally identified and named due to their essential role in sexual differentiation in yeasts. in spite of their common five-helical structure, sam domains do not exhibit significant sequence homology  <cit> . this sequence diversity reflects a large diversity of function. sam domains have been found in nearly  <dig> proteins that include a diverse array of signaling molecules such as the transcriptional repressors tel  <cit>  and polycomb  <cit> , diacyglycerol kinase δ <dig>   <cit> , and eph receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> .

structural studies of the sam domains from the epha <dig> receptor  <cit>  and ephb <dig> receptor  <cit>  showed that the helical arrangement creates two interfaces, suggesting a mechanism for sam domain dimerization. these interfaces are composed of two complementary surfaces that associate mainly by hydrophobic interactions. similar interfaces have been identified in tel, polycomb and dgkδ <dig>  and these sam domains form extended polymers that have important regulatory roles. in the lipid kinase dgkδ <dig>  sam domain-mediated polymerization keeps the enzyme in an inactive form and localized to cytoplasmic vesicles. upon egf stimulation, dgkδ <dig> is recruited to the plasma membrane, where its substrate is located  <cit> . the sam domain of the transcriptional repressors polyhomeotic  <cit>  and tel  <cit>  form helical polymeric filaments, suggesting a mechanism by which transcriptional repressor complexes might spread along the chromosome.

the amino-terminal  <dig> residues of ack <dig> contain sam domain-like sequences that are conserved across species  <cit> . fusion of the ack <dig> sam domain sequence to gfp resulted in localization at the plasma membrane  <cit> . deletion of the sam domain from full-length ack <dig> reduced the level of autophosphorylation in hela cells, suggesting the involvement of the n-terminus in enzyme regulation  <cit> . here, we explore the role of the n-terminal domain in ack <dig> localization and regulation. our data suggest that the sam domain promotes ack <dig> dimerization at the plasma membrane to allow intermolecular autophosphorylation, analogous to the role of the transmembrane domains of receptor tyrosine kinases.

RESULTS
analysis of ack <dig> autophosphorylation by western blotting
to test for the importance of the amino-terminal sam domain in ack <dig> regulation, we created the deletion and truncation constructs that are shown in figure 1a. in the construct Δnt, the first  <dig> amino acid residues were deleted. nkd corresponds to the first  <dig> residues of ack <dig> including the sam domain and the kinase domain, and kd is the kinase domain alone.

we expressed these constructs in cos <dig> cells and analyzed their activities in whole cell lysates by probing for phosphorylation of y <dig>  we previously identified y <dig>  which lies in the activation loop of ack <dig>  as the major autophosphorylation site  <cit> . we confirmed that y <dig> is the major site in cos <dig> cells, and that it represents a site of autophosphorylation rather than a site for another kinase . phosphorylated ack <dig> was detected in the lanes corresponding to nkd and wt, but the lanes corresponding to kd and Δnt did not show any detectable signal for py284-ack <dig> . thus, the level of ack <dig> autophosphorylation was drastically reduced by the deletion of the sam domain both in the context of the full-length protein  and of the shorter constructs . the membrane was reprobed with anti-ha antibody to determine total levels of the proteins in the blot . additional examples are provided in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  the ratio of py284-ack <dig> signal to total ack <dig> signal for several blots is quantified in figure 1c. these results suggest that the sam domain plays an important role in the regulation of ack <dig> by promoting its autophosphorylation.

we also analyzed the overall phosphotyrosine content of cells expressing the different ack <dig> constructs . expression of full-length ack <dig> resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins, while fewer proteins were phosphorylated in Δnt-expressing cells. for both full-length ack <dig> and Δnt, a band was present that co-migrated with the phosphorylated ack <dig> protein, although the band was weaker for Δnt. no signal was observed for Δnt in the py <dig> blot, but this construct contains other previously identified phosphorylation sites  that may account for the signal in the ptyr blot  <cit> . expression of the nkd construct did not produce any drastic change in the pattern of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins as compared to untransfected cos <dig> cells, but a tyrosine phosphorylated band migrating at the position of nkd was detected. in contrast, expression of the isolated kinase domain  did not stimulate phosphorylation of cellular proteins compared to untransfected control cells, and no evidence for autophosphorylation was detected. this is consistent with the data in the py <dig> blot, since this residue is probably the only one available for phosphorylation in kd and nkd. these data suggest that ack <dig> n-terminus is important for its activation.

the deletion of ack <dig> n-terminus affects subcellular localization
as reported earlier  <cit> , wt ack <dig> was localized to the cytoplasm in amorphous intracellular structures . Δnt was present in similar large intracellular structures . by contrast, nkd was mostly localized to the plasma membrane, while the isolated kinase domain  showed a diffuse cytosolic localization. the difference between nkd and kd localization patterns was consistent with the reported ability of the sam domain to direct ack <dig> to the plasma membrane  <cit> . the intracellular localization of wt ack <dig> and Δnt suggested that other regions of the protein may also contain targeting information, consistent with the observation that the c-terminus of ack <dig> interacts with a number of proteins.

analysis of ack <dig> autophosphorylation by quantitative immunofluorescence
next, we tested whether the various forms of ack <dig> were active in all cellular sites. we studied the subcellular localization of the autophosphorylated, activated forms of ack <dig> and the mutants by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-py <dig> ack <dig> antibody. in the cases where it was detected, the signal for py <dig> ack <dig> colocalized exactly with the distribution of total ack <dig> .

to determine the relative activities of the constructs, we quantitated anti-py <dig> staining  and anti-ha staining  . the ratios of fluorescence intensities  were normalized to the value corresponding to wild type . figure 3b shows results from a representative experiment, while 3c shows the merged data from three experiments. consistent with the western blotting results, the level of autophosphorylation was significantly decreased by the deletion of the n-terminus, both in the context of the full length and the minimal construct. the construct Δnt showed a ~2-fold decrease in autophosphorylation compared to wild type, while the isolated kinase domain  had a ~9-fold decrease in autophosphorylation compared to nkd. the autophosphorylation level of kd was not significantly different from the negative control .

concentration-dependent activity of the purified ack <dig> kinase domain
a possible explanation for the negligible autophosphorylation of the kd construct  is that the isolated kinase domain might be inactive. several tyrosine kinase catalytic domains  require the presence of accessory domains for activity  <cit> . to test this possibility, we introduced the ack <dig> kinase domain into a recombinant baculovirus, expressed the protein in insect cells, and purified it to homogeneity. we tested the catalytic activity of ack <dig> kinase domain by carrying out kinetic experiments using varying concentrations of a peptide substrate derived from the tyr <dig> sequence of wasp . as shown in figure 4a, the purified kinase domain was active towards the peptide. experiments with varying atp concentrations yielded a km value of  <dig> μm . thus, although the kinase domain expressed in cells is inactive, the isolated kinase domain has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. we hypothesized that the observed activity in vitro may be a function of the increased protein concentration under these conditions. the sam domains in other proteins mediate polymerization processes that regulate activity  <cit> , and the sam domain of ack <dig> acts as a membrane-targeting signal . in full-length ack <dig>  the sam domain may increase the local concentration by causing dimerization or multimerization at the sites where it is recruited.

kinases that dimerize and transphosphorylate show concentration-dependent activity. in order to test the effect of ack <dig> concentration on autophosphorylation, we first dephosphorylated the his6-tagged enzyme purified from sf <dig> cells using the yersinia phosphatase yop. next, we used lipid vesicles to control the local concentration of ack <dig> kinase domain. dephosphorylated ack <dig> was incubated with atp in the presence of small unilamellar vesicles containing different mole fractions of a lipid with a ni-nta head group . this method was used previously to demonstrate the activation of egfr by formation of an asymmetric dimer  <cit> . thus, in these experiments, we mimicked the dimerization function of the sam domain by using the hexahistidine tag to control the local concentrations of the isolated kinase domain. the concentration of enzyme was kept constant, and the concentration of ni-nta was kept constant  to ensure that any observed effects were due to changes in effective local concentration. attachment of the purified kinase domain to vesicles caused a significant increase in autophosphorylation, as judged by anti-py <dig> western blotting . the stimulation of autophosphorylation by dogs-nta-ni was dose-dependent, as vesicles with  <dig> mole % dogs-nta-ni produced a further increase over vesicles with  <dig> mole % dogs-nta-ni. vesicles that contained no ni-nta did not produce any increase in autophosphorylation compared to the activity in the absence of vesicles, indicating that that the observed effect was not due to any unspecific interaction between lipids and proteins .

the vesicles were also used to analyze the catalytic activity of purified ack <dig> kinase domain towards a peptide substrate in a continuous spectrophotometric assay . the catalytic activity of the enzyme in the presence of vesicles containing  <dig> mole % dogs-nta-ni was 2-fold higher than with vesicles containing no ni-nta, or than solution reactions . we confirmed that the effect was due to binding between the his6-ack <dig> kinase domain and dogs-nta-ni by performing the assay in the presence of  <dig> mm imidazole; under these conditions the ack <dig> activity was comparable to the activity observed in the absence of vesicles or in solution. taken together, the data show that artificially increasing the local concentration of the isolated kinase domain increases autophosphorylation and catalytic activity.

ack <dig> self associates in cells
we investigated the capacity of ack <dig> constructs to self-associate in cells. cos  <dig> cells were transfected with flag-tagged full length ack <dig> alone or together with ha-tagged nkd or kd. flag-ack <dig> was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using anti-flag antibody, processed for sds-page and transferred to pvdf membranes. blots were probed for the presence of co-immunoprecipitated ha-tagged proteins. the densitometry readings corresponding to flag-tagged ack <dig> and to ha-tagged ack <dig> in the immunocomplexes were used to calculate the ratio ha-ack1/flag-ack <dig>  we found that ha-nkd coimmunoprecipitated with flag ack <dig> 3-fold more strongly than ha-kd . thus, although there is residual self-association between the kinase domain and full-length ack <dig>  these data suggest that the n-terminal region strengthens the association.

discussion
sam domains are a diverse group of protein-protein interaction motifs that frequently mediate homo- or hetero- dimerization and oligomerization. in several enzymes, sam domains regulate activity by localized polymerization at the membrane or in the nucleus. in this work, we show that the sam domain of ack <dig> is required for autophosphorylation. our data suggest that the n-terminus of ack <dig> mediates self-association, and that the increased local concentrations result in increased autophosphorylation and kinase activity.

to study the role of the ack <dig> n-terminus in autophosphorylation, we deleted the first  <dig> amino acids of the polypeptide  and we compared it to the full-length protein . in addition, we created a minimal construct that contains only the n-terminus and the kinase domain  and we compared it to the isolated kinase domain . since ack <dig> is a large protein that contains several different regions, some of whose roles are not completely understood, this simplified system proved to be useful to dissect the role of the n-terminus in ack <dig> activation and intracellular localization.

the deletion of the ack <dig> n-terminus produced a significant decrease in ack <dig> autophosphorylation in cells. similar trends were observed by two different methods, although the western blot quantitation method appears to have a broader dynamic range than the quantitative immunofluorescence. autophosphorylation of Δnt was 15-fold lower than wt ack <dig> by western blotting  and 2-fold lower by immunofluorescence . the effect on the minimal nkd construct was more pronounced: autophosphorylation of kd was 27-fold lower than nkd by western blotting and 9-fold lower by immunofluorescence. in the immunofluorescence assays , autophosphorylation of kd was significantly lower than Δnt. a possible explanation for this difference is that other regions of ack <dig>  in addition to the n-terminus, may mediate interactions or provide inputs that result in increased autophosphorylation.

consistent with published data  <cit> , we observed that ack <dig> n-terminus is a membrane-targeting domain . the minimal constructs nkd and kd show very distinct intracellular localizations: nkd is clearly localized at the plasma membrane and phosphorylated, while kd is diffuse and cytosolic, and unphosphorylated at y <dig> . the situation is more complex in the cases of wt and Δnt. they both show a punctate distribution that is not identical to either nkd or kd. this suggests that the localization of full-length ack <dig> results from the cumulative effect of interactions mediated by the sam domain and other regions of the protein. it is likely that interactions between full-length ack <dig> and other proteins including clathrin  <cit> , sorting nexin  <dig>  <cit> , and ubiquitinated egfr  <cit>  play a role in determining subcellular localization.

in the context of full-length ack <dig>  the primary function of the sam domain may be to promote enzyme activation. we used an in vitro system to explicitly test the hypothesis that self-association is an activation mechanism for ack <dig>  we found that ack <dig> kinase domain attached to vesicles showed a concentration-dependent increase in autophosphorylation and in phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate . flag-ack <dig> co-immunoprecipitated more weakly with ha-kd than with ha-nkd, suggesting that the n-terminus promotes ack <dig> homodimerization . these results suggest that increasing the local concentration of ack <dig> catalytic domain by sam domain-mediated dimerization is potentially a mechanism for enzyme activation.

counterbalancing mechanisms presumably exist to reverse the sam domain-mediated activation of ack <dig>  although these mechanisms are undefined at present, the domain arrangement of ack <dig> is complex, and it is likely that other regions of the polypeptide are involved in ack <dig> downregulation. we have shown that the mig6-homology region  located at the c-terminus of ack <dig> is involved in an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction  <cit> . the mhr is also capable of binding to egfr kinase domain in vitro  and in cell lysates  <cit> . this ack1-egfr interaction could potentially be involved in the dynamic regulation of ack <dig> activity. growth factor treatment of cells promotes phosphorylation of the ack <dig> c-terminus  <cit> , which could potentially destabilize autoinhibitory interactions and unmask the sam domain for membrane recruitment and ack <dig> activation.

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that:  the n-terminal sam domain of ack <dig> is required for full ack <dig> autophosphorylation and kinase activity;  the sam domain has the potential to drive ack <dig> to the plasma membrane, although in the context of full-length ack <dig> other protein-protein interactions make important contributions;  increasing the local concentration of ack <dig> stimulates in vitro kinase activity; and  ack <dig> forms dimers  in cells.
