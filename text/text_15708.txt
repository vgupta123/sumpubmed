BACKGROUND
treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum  is the causative agent of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease affecting more than  <dig> million people worldwide each year  <cit> . after a period of decline in the 1990s, the number of reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis has been raising annually since  <dig> in the united states  <cit> . sequencing of the  <dig>  mbp genome of the nichols strain of tpa in  <dig>  <cit>  greatly stimulated study of this unculturable pathogen. one important direction not yet developed is use of the nichols sequence for comparative studies to determine variation between different syphilis isolates, how representative nichols is of tpa, and the genetic differences between closely related treponemes causing different diseases . to sample strains on a sufficient scale, rapid, inexpensive, and highly accurate sequencing methods are needed. traditional whole genome shotgun sequencing methods using dideoxy-terminators  are relatively slow and costly to be applied to numerous samples. here we sequence a treponemal genome by comparative genome sequencing   <cit> , which provides an alternative to wgs-ddt sequencing of closely related genomes. cgs was previously used for mutation discovery in viruses  <cit> , in mutagenized laboratory bacterial and fungal strains  <cit> , in clinical isolates of bacteria  <cit> , and for whole genome scale comparative studies  <cit> .

the tpa isolate street strain  <dig>  was isolated in  <dig> in atlanta from a patient with secondary syphilis  <cit>  who did not respond to erythromycin therapy that was used because of a penicillin allergy  <cit> . in vitro testing of ss <dig> revealed it to be less susceptible to a variety of antibiotics when compared to nichols  <cit> . nichols strain was isolated in  <dig> in washington, d.c. from cerebrospinal fluid of the patient with neurosyphilis  <cit> . previous studies  showed ss <dig> had all genes of the nichols genome as judged by hybridization to a microarray containing pcr products of all annotated nichols open reading frames   <cit> . to compare these closely related, yet phenotypically distinct strains, we sequenced the ss <dig> genome by cgs.

RESULTS
identification of heterologous regions and sequence changes between nichols and ss <dig> strains
in the first mapping stage of cgs, no regions with significantly stronger labeled ss <dig> dna signals were observed, indicating no increase in gene copy number in the ss <dig> genome. regions giving significantly weaker ss <dig> signals indicated  <dig> candidate regions of variation encompassing  <dig> or more overlapping oligonucleotide targets. the sequencing data identified  <dig> snps in the ss <dig> genome. an additional  <dig> questionable snps were suggested in repeated sequences of the genome but did not score well in a snp uniqueness algorithm  <cit> , and thus could represent false positives due to cross hybridization with the other repeats. ddt sequencing of  <dig> such regions revealed  <dig> real snps,  <dig> false positives, and one position with  <dig> alleles within the ss <dig> population . therefore these questionable snps were not included in the final sequence, unless they were verified by ddt sequencing . an additional  <dig> positions out of the  <dig> snps identified by cgs were ddt sequenced.  <dig> snps were confirmed  and  <dig> false positives were found.

nt – nucleotide; snp – single nucleotide polymorphism; aas described in  <cit> ; bregions previously described in table  <dig> were excluded; csnps identified using cgs in these regions were verified by ddt sequencing.

 <dig> out of  <dig> candidate regions were identified as snps in the second sequencing stage but there were  <dig> regions encompassing  <dig> oligonucleotide targets where sequence changes could not be determined. these represented possible hypervariable regions with multiple differences from nichols in the sequencing  <dig> mers. dna regions comprising these sites were grouped into  <dig> larger regions , amplified by pcr and ddt sequenced. in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases, mostly closely spaced snps and/or short insertions or deletions  were found while no changes were seen in  <dig> cases , which is in agreement with data obtained by others  <cit> . ddt sequencing of hypervariable regions suggested by the first phase of cgs identified nucleotide changes in these regions  and also in the vicinity of these regions, where results of the first cgs phase suggested no changes , indicating the need for extension of ddt sequenced regions of at least  <dig> bp in both directions. additional short indels were discovered during ddt sequencing of regions identified by wgf . altogether,  <dig> false positive snps ,  <dig> false negative snps and an additional  <dig> indels  were found in these ddt sequenced regions . the overall confirmation of data suggests that repeated regions of the genome are limitations for snp discovery and almost half of possible hypervariable regions are false positive results.

the accuracy of cgs was determined by comparison to the results of ddt sequencing for  <dig> regions encompassing  <dig>  bp . selection of these regions was focused on possible variable regions in ss14/nichols hybridization experiments  using a microarray of tpa coding sequences  <cit>  and thus was not completely random. these regions included  <dig> snps and no false positive or false negative snps/indels were found. these results indicate an error frequency comparable to or lower than that of high quality finished ddt sequence.

assessment of reproducibility of cgs experiments
to test the reproducibility of the method, the genome of tpa ss <dig> was sequenced twice with the cgs approach, using  <dig> independent dna isolations from two subsequent inoculations of rabbit testes . when most of the variable genomic regions were excluded from the analysis , cgs discovered  <dig> snps in each dna preparation. the experiments agreed at  <dig> snps , and  <dig> snps were predicted by only one cgs experiment. out of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> were found to be real, as shown by ddt sequencing , three loci showed intrastrain heterogeneity in one of the two ss <dig> dna isolations, with one allele identical to the nichols genome sequence and a second allele identical to the base change found by cgs. two snps were predicted falsely, and in both cases the false snp was located next to a real snp. the reproducibility of the cgs method is thus likely to be limited by the presence of snp clusters and influenced by genetically different subpopulations in the test sample.

physical mapping of treponemal chromosome
to verify the complete sequence of ss <dig> strain, to screen for possible discrepancies in cross-reacting repeat regions  and insertions of unique sequences, wgf was performed. this physical mapping approach showed the order of the orfs along the chromosome is identical to nichols genome and  <dig> large indel regions were identified. a  <dig> bp deletion upstream of tp <dig> was found by both cgs and wgf methods. three additional indels were found only by wgf, two insertions  and one deletion  . a deletion in tp <dig> and an insertion in tp0433–tp <dig> comprised tandem repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. similar analysis of the nichols strain revealed length differences in genes tp0433–tp <dig> compared to the published sequence  as described previously  <cit> . moreover, intrastrain heterogeneity in the nichols strain was observed in regions comprising tp0126–tp <dig> and upstream of tp <dig> with one allele identical to the published sequence. in the nichols bac library  <cit> , similar intrastrain heterogeneity was found in the vicinity of gene tp <dig>  this region comprises a  <dig> bp insertion between genes tp <dig> and tp <dig> in ss <dig> strain. a similar region was previously described in another syphilitic strain  and was found to contain a sequence similar to tprk and is believed to be recipient site of the tprk conversion  <cit> . altogether, three large indels were not detected by cgs. we suggest probable reasons for this fact are  the length of the repeats is similar to/longer than oligonucleotides used on the array and  sequence changes were found in nichols dna when compared to published complete sequence used for mapping array design .

analysis of whole genome interstrain heterogeneity between nichols and ss14
when results of cgs, wgf and ddt sequencing were combined,  <dig> snps ,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> insertions were identified . sequence changes of variable regions v1–v <dig> of tp <dig>  tprk, were not included, because sequences of these regions were found to differ greatly in both length and sequence within the ss <dig> population, in agreement with investigations published previously  <cit> . obtained data have been used to compile the sequence of the ss <dig> genome . the genbank entry contains ns in the positions of variable regions v1–v <dig> of tprk gene. all discovered sequence changes are listed in table s <dig> .

interstrain sequence heterogeneity discovered between strains nichols and ss <dig> included silent mutations, amino acid alterations/indels, gene fusions, and truncations and elongations of open reading frames due to indels. among the snps found by cgs was an adenine to guanine transition in both copies of 23s rdna in ss <dig> strain. this sequence change was previously described in association with the ss <dig> erythromycin resistance  <cit> . many discovered indels did not disrupt the open reading frames and represented variable number of nucleotides in homopolymeric tracts , variable number of short motif repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides , and variable number of longer motif repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> nts .

frameshift mutations and other changes affecting protein length are presented in table  <dig>  besides  <dig> hypothetical proteins , flab <dig> and tex protein were affected. sequence changes in four cases led to fusion of orfs . three of these genes  were predicted to code for possible surface protein virulence factors  <cit> . moreover, antigen p83/ <dig>  hypothetical gene tp <dig>  conserved hypothetical gene tp <dig> and the fused proteins tp0433–tp <dig> and tp0468–tp <dig> were described to be antigenic in rabbits  <cit> . two of the frameshift changes were confirmed to be present in the nichols strain genomic dna .

snps in ss <dig> were found to be non-uniformly distributed with the number of snps per orf varying from  <dig> to  <dig>  hypervariable regions are listed in table  <dig> and include orfs encoding  <dig> hypothetical proteins, tpr proteins  and outer membrane protein tp <dig>  tp <dig> was predicted to be a virulence factor  <cit>  and was experimentally verified to be an antigen  <cit> . it is of interest that the most variable region of the genome represents tp <dig>  which encodes a protein that is antigenic in both rabbit and human infections  <cit>  and was found to serve as fibronectin and laminin binding protein  <cit> .

the distribution of snps in coding and non-coding sequences of ss <dig> was not significantly different. orfs represent  <dig> % of total genomic sequence;  <dig> % of all snps were in coding sequences corresponding to  <dig> snps in genes  and  <dig> snps  in intergenic regions . the frequency of snps was different among putative protein classes . the highest frequency of snps was in hypothetical genes, lowest in housekeeping genes. in addition, housekeeping genes had the lowest number of snps altering amino acid sequences indicating conservation of these gene products.

identification of intrastrain variability in tpa population
because ddt sequencing of some pcr products did not result in an unambiguous sequence, wgs-ddt sequencing of small insert libraries was performed. analysis of libraries and pcr products revealed multiple  sequence variants in tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig> , tp <dig>  and tp <dig>  and in the intergenic region between tpri and tprj. consensus sequences were mostly identical to the nichols published sequence, but some positions had minor alternative sequences or vice versa. altogether, intrastrain genetic heterogeneity comprised polymorphisms in  <dig> nucleotide positions and one polymorphism in a homopolymeric stretch .

discussion
obtaining the complete genome sequence of a second syphilis spirochete  shows the utility of the cgs strategy for treponemal comparative genomics. this is the first application of this approach to sequence an entire genome. this approach can be used when highly similar genomes are investigated and one genome sequence of closely related organism is known. the cgs strategy represents a rapid  and scalable methodology to sequence multiple syphilitic strains and clinical isolates. in the present study there was a need to further investigate some variable regions, but the directed ddt sequencing required was much less than needed to sequence a whole genome, thus lowering the total cost of obtaining the genome sequence.

there are some of the tpa-specific limitations of this approach to whole genome sequencing. because the cgs strategy uses genomic dna as a probe, accuracy is affected by the presence of repeated sequences. repeat regions hybridize to more than one oligonucleotide on a tiling array resulting in both reduced sensitivity to detect changes, as well as ambiguity in assigning locations for the variants detected. precautions have to be taken when inspecting tpr regions and others  which cross-react based on sequence similarity. such regions, together with highly variable regions, need to be analyzed by wgf and sequenced by ddt to reveal true nucleotide changes and numbers of repeated regions. another possible restriction of this methodology arises from the character of the tpa population. multiple sequence variants in the nichols strain population were both described previously and identified in this work, and hybridization based sequence changes discovery in these regions is influenced by the ratio between/among different sequence variants in the population. finally, the accuracy of the genome sequence produced by cgs is dependent on the accuracy of the reference genome sequence. as suggested by two newly revealed frameshifts in nichols strain sequence, discovered sequence changes have to be verified in nichols sequence to describe real sequence changes compared to nichols genome.

the ss <dig> genome brings a first insight into the whole genome variability within tpa. both nichols and ss <dig> cause infection in rabbits and so are not believed to be attenuated to cause infection in man, thus it is very probable none of the differences may affect the ability of the bacteria to cause the disease. the examples of interstrain heterogeneity and multiple alleles in a population of haploid organisms are candidates for antigenic variation, contingency genes and other types of ssr   <cit> . changes resulting in significant differences in protein sequences  and hypervariable regions affected novel genes, membrane antigens and tpr proteins. the tpr protein family includes  <dig> treponema pallidum repeat proteins, found uniquely in this bacterium and showing sequence similarity to major sheath protein of treponema denticola.  <dig> out of  <dig> tpr genes  were found to be affected by sequence changes representing a higher proportion than the whole genome rate . positions showing interstrain and intrastrain heterogeneity or both were found in tpr genes. altogether  <dig> snps and  <dig> intrastrain variable nucleotide positions, with at least one allele identical to the sequence of the nichols genome, were found in tpr genes . based on the fact that tpr genes share a high degree of similarity on the dna level, we expect differences could be underestimated due to the limitations of the hybridization method for repeated sequences. multiple alleles of tpr genes were described among and within tpa strains  <cit>  and some tpa repeated regions  were used as loci for typing of clinical isolates  <cit> . newly identified hypervariable regions  represent candidate sequences to screen clinical isolates and have potential to be used as typing markers of strains and isolates. in addition, different strains of tpa have already been tested for association with higher risk for neuroinvasion in rabbits  <cit>  and identification of underlying sequence changes will enable prediction of such risks. the identified variation in novel genes suggests other targets besides tpr genes could be responsible for antigenic variation in tpa, or without support of further expression and antigenicity data, these could represent pseudogenes.

CONCLUSIONS
the cgs strategy combined with wgf represents a rapid and simply scalable method to assess genome-wide genetic variability within tpa strains and subspecies, which share a very unusual degree of sequence similarity and lack genome rearrangements . we expect this method to be combined with new sequencing technologies to produce high quality genome sequences to provide important data to design genotyping systems for more intensive strain sampling. sequence variants could be readily used for molecular typing and identification of ss <dig> and nichols strains and, with accumulation of additional data from other tpa genomes, for epidemiologic applications and clinical discrimination between reinfection and reactivation of syphilitic processes. moreover, the ability to now sequence numerous tpa strains, especially those showing different degrees of virulence, will allow phenotype to be correlated with sequence. this is a significant development for an organism of important public health impact, but for which standard bacterial genetic methods are untenable.
