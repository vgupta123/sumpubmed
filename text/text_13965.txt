BACKGROUND
hydrophobins are small secreted proteins, produced only by filamentous fungi, which forms amphipathic layers on the outer surface of fungal cell walls  <cit> . the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic layer is exposed to the outside environment, while the hydrophilic side is directed towards cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> . hydrophobins are characterized by the presence of eight conserved cysteine  residues in a typical pattern  <cit> . apart from this, they show very limited amino acid sequence similarity with each other. the cys residues form four intra-molecular disulphide bridges suggested to prevent self-assembly of the hydrophobins in the absence of a hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface  <cit> . based on distinct hydropathy patterns and the type of layer they form, hydrophobins are divided in to two classes  <cit> . recent bioinformatic analyses have identified an intermediate class of hydrophobins in trichoderma and aspergillus species  <cit> . class i hydrophobins form amyloid-like rodlets that are highly insoluble in water, organic solvents and detergents like sds and require strong acids for solubilisation, while amphipathic monolayers formed by class ii hydrophobins lack the fibrillar rodlets and can be dissolved in aqueous organic solvents and detergents  <cit> . another distinguishing characteristic of hydrophobins is the specific spacing patterns of conserved cys residues; the consensus cys spacing pattern c-x5-10-cc-x33-41-c-x16-25-c-x5- cc-x13-17-c of class i differs from the consensus cys spacing pattern c-x9-10-cc-x11-c-x16-c-x8-9- cc-x10-c of class ii  <cit> .

hydrophobins act as natural surfactants and reduce the surface tension of the medium, and perform a variety of biological functions in the life cycle of filamentous fungi. these include formation of a protective layer surrounding the hyphae and sexual structures, development of aerial hyphae, sporulation and spore dispersal, and fruit body formation  <cit> . in addition, hydrophobins mediate contact and communication between the fungus and its environments; that can include recognition and adhesion to host surfaces, and development of penetration structures during pathogenic and symbiotic interactions  <cit> . hydrophobin mpg <dig> of the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae is necessary for leaf surface attachment and appresorium formation  <cit> , while another hydrophobin mhp <dig>  of the same fungus is involved in the late stage of pathogenesis  <cit> . in the entomopathogenic fungus beauveria bassiana, deletion of hydrophobin genes results in decreased spore hydrophobicity and adhesion, loss of water-mediated dispersal, and lowered virulence to insects  <cit> . similarly, in another entomopathogenic fungus, metarhizium brunneum, characterization of hydrophobins showed their role in conidiation, hydrophobicity, pigmentation and virulence  <cit> . contrary to these reports, functional characterization of hydrophobins in fusarium verticilloides does not indicate a role of these proteins in growth, infection or mycelium hydrophobicity  <cit> . similar results are reported for botrytis cinerea where deletion mutants of hydrophobin genes does not display any phenotypic differences compared to the wild type  strain  <cit> .

the fungus clonostachys rosea is a ubiquitous soil borne ascomycete known for its antagonistic abilities against a wide range of plant pathogens  <cit> , and for its entomopathogenic and nematophagous behaviour  <cit> . the modes of action of c. rosea as a biological control agent  are not fully known, although mycoparasitism, competition for nutrients, and secondary metabolite production are suggested to play significant roles  <cit> . furthermore, c. rosea can rapidly colonize outer and inner root surfaces  of plants like carrot, barley, cucumber and wheat  <cit> , which results in induced defence responses  <cit> . hydrophobins in mycoparasitic trichoderma spp, are suggested to be involved in hyphal development, sporulation, and plant root attachment and colonization  <cit> .

the current study aims to understand the biological function of hydrophobins in c. rosea with emphasis on its role in fungal growth and development, antagonism, and interactions with plants. our results showed induced expression of c. rosea hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> in dual cultures during self interaction in comparison to interaction with the phytopathogenic fungi b. cinerea and f. graminearum. in addition, hyd <dig> showed significant upregulation in conidiating mycelium, although a basal expression of c. rosea hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> was observed in all conditions tested. by generating individual hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion , complementation  and hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> double deletion  strains, we probed the roles of two c. rosea hydrophobins in conidial hydrophobicity and plant root colonization.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic analysis of c. rosea hydrophobins
blast searches against a c. rosea strain ik <dig> draft genome database using a total of  <dig> class i, class ia  and class ii hydrophobin amino acid sequences from trichoderma spp.  <cit> , identified three genes with an e-value ≤ 1 × 10- <dig>  the presence of additional hydrophobin gene/s in c. rosea genome cannot be excluded, as the short hydrophobin genes may be problematic to predict. identification of start and stop codons, determination of exon-intron boundaries and open reading frames  were done manually, and were further validated by cdna sequencing. the resulting genes were named hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  the hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> sequences are submitted to genbank with accession numbers kf <dig>  kf <dig>  kf <dig>  respectively. the 267 bp hyd <dig> orf was interrupted by a predicted 48 bp intron, the 372 bp hyd <dig> orf was interrupted by a predicted 86 bp intron, while the 300 bp hyd <dig> orf was interrupted by a predicted 62 bp intron. the predicted  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid  sequences of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  respectively, all contained a 60- <dig> aa core structure that contained the cys residues. the conserved domain analysis of translated aa sequences using simple modular architecture research tool  identified a single hydrophobin_ <dig> domain  between aa positions 21- <dig>  21- <dig> and 30-91for hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  respectively. this structure was further confirmed by interproscan and conserved domain search  analyses. signal p predicted 16- <dig> aa long secretion signal peptides in the n-termini of each c. rosea hydrophobin. the highest similarity of hyd <dig> was with cerato-ulmin of geosmithia spp. and ophistoma nova-ulmi , of hyd <dig> with t. atroviride hydrophobin and spore related hydrophobin of t. viride , and of hyd <dig> with hydrophobin from fusarium spp. . in addition, aa similarity between hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> were below 20%.

hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> contained eight cys in their protein sequences, while hyd <dig> contained only seven as the cys residue closest to the c-terminus was replaced by a glutamine  . this replacement was similar to the t. harzianum hydrophobin qid <dig> that also contained seven cys  <cit> , although hyd <dig> did not show the extended n-terminus of qid <dig>  the cys spacing of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> conformed to the pattern of class ii . furthermore, the hydropathy patterns of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> were all indicative of class ii hydrophobins . taken together, these analyses suggest that c. rosea hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> encode putative class ii hydrophobins.

a phylogenetic tree was constructed with hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> together with class ii hydrophobins from trichoderma spp. and additional representatives of known class ii hydrophobins . the result from the phylogenetic analysis showed that hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> do not represent recent gene duplicates as they clustered in different parts of the tree .

expression analysis of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd3
quantitative pcr  was used to analyse the expression pattern of c. rosea hydrophobins. in relation to glucose, no significant expression changes in hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> or hyd <dig> expression were found in sms culture representing carbon limitation  or nitrogen limitation  . gene expression analysis was performed on rna extracted from germinated conidia , mycelium , conidiating mycelium , aerial hyphae , and during interaction with barley roots . in relation to gc, a significant  induction in hyd <dig> expression was found in m, cm and ah . in addition, cm showed significant  induced expression of hyd <dig> in comparison with m, ah and cr-br . no significant changes in expression of hyd <dig> or hyd <dig> were found in any of the developmental conditions tested or during root interaction . for hydrophobin gene expression during interactions between c. rosea and b. cinerea or f. graminearum, rna was extracted from the mycelium harvested at different stages of interaction as described in methods section. transcript levels of c. rosea hydrophobins were found to be significantly induced  at all stages of self interaction in comparison with interspecific interactions . no significant difference in expression of c. rosea hydrophobin genes were found between different stages of interaction with either of prey fungus except the significant  induced expression of hyd <dig> at contact and after contact stage in comparison to before contact stage during the interaction with b. cinerea, but not with the f. graminearum . an additional observation was that a basal expression of all c. rosea hydrophobin genes was observed in all tested conditions.

generation of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd1hyd <dig> deletion and complementation strains
single hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion mutants were generated by replacing hyd1and hyd <dig> with the hygromycin resistance gene selection cassette  by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . a double Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> deletion strain was constructed by replacing hyd <dig> with the nourseothricin resistance gene selection cassette  in a Δhyd <dig> strain. despite several attempts of transformation and screening of more than  <dig> hygromycin resistance colonies, we failed to generate a hyd <dig> deletion mutant. successful gene replacement in mitotically stable putative mutants was confirmed by pcr as described previously  <cit>  using primers located within the hygb/nat <dig> cassettes together with primers located upstream and downstream of the construct . the expected size of pcr fragments were amplified in Δhyd <dig>  Δhyd <dig> and Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> strains, while no amplification was observed in wild type  . the complete deletion of hyd1and hyd <dig> was further confirmed by pcr amplification of fragments of expected size using primer pairs located outside the construct borders, from mutant and wt strains . furthermore, reverse transcriptase pcr  experiments using primers specific to hyd1and hyd <dig> sequences demonstrated the complete loss of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> transcript in each individual and double deletion mutants .

single hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion mutants were complemented with wt hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> genes respectively, through atmt. successful integration of the hyd1-comp and hyd3-comp vectors  in mitotically stable mutant was confirmed by pcr amplification of nat <dig> . rt-pcr from randomly selected nat <dig> positive hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> complemented  strains using hyd1- and hyd3-specific primer pairs demonstrated restored hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> transcription while no transcripts were detected in the parental deletion strains .

effects of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion on colony morphology, growth rate, conidiation, hydrophobicity, and secreted protein concentration
no difference in colony morphology was found between wt and deletion mutants . all deletion strains showed significantly  increased growth rate and conidiation on potato dextrose agar  medium in comparison to wt, although no differences were detected between single deletion strains or between single and double deletion strains . complementation strains Δhyd1+ Δhyd3+ showed partial restoration of normal conidiation levels .

hydrophobicity of wt and mutant strains were tested by carefully placing 10 μl water or sds  droplets onto the surface of non-conidiating mycelia . all droplets remained on the surface of mycelium and no visible difference in shape or contact angle of droplets was found in between wt and mutant strains even up to overnight incubation in closed petri-dishes at room temperature. similar results were obtained when conidiated mycelia  were used. conidial surface hydrophobicity was further analysed by using an assay for microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons   <cit> . the math assay showed no difference in hydrophobicity index between wt and single deletion mutants; however conidia of the double deletion mutant showed significant  reduction in hydrophobicity index . in addition, unlike the wt, Δhyd <dig> and Δhyd <dig>  conidia from the Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> strain formed cell aggregates when harvested in water .

to analyse total protein secretion, protein concentrations were determined in culture filtrates of wt and mutant strains grown in liquid potato dextrose broth  medium. results showed a significant  9% reduction in protein concentration in Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> culture filtrates compared to wt or single deletion strains, while no differences were observed in between wt and Δhyd <dig> or Δhyd <dig> strains .

effect of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion on abiotic stress tolerance
susceptibility of wt and mutant strains to various abiotic stress conditions were tested on pda plates containing nacl, sorbitol, sds, or caffeine. no significant differences in growth rate were recorded between mutant and wt strains on any of the tested stress media, except for significantly  increased growth rate of the double deletion mutant Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> on pda containing nacl . significant  increases in conidial germination rates  were recorded in mutant strains in comparison with wt  on all tested abiotic stress media, although no differences were found between wt and mutant strains on control pda medium . in another set of experiments we assayed the conidial susceptibility to cold. after  <dig>   <dig> or 9 days of incubation at 4°c, only 63%, 33% or 30% respectively, of wt conidia germinated after placing them on pda medium for <dig> h at 25°c. in contrast, similarly treated conidia of mutants strain showed significantly  higher germination rates  . however, no differences in conidial germination between either of single or double deletion mutants were found in any of the stress condition tested .

deletion of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> did not affect hyd <dig> expression
in order to examine whether or not deletion of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  individually or simultaneously, affects the expression pattern of hyd <dig>  rna was extracted from conidiating mycelium of wt and mutant strains grown on pda plates. gene expression analysis revealed no significant difference in hyd <dig> expression between wt and either single or double deletion strains .

in vitro assay to test the antagonistic ability of c. rosea strains
the Δhyd <dig>  Δhyd <dig>  and Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> strains overgrew b. cinerea, f. graminearum and rhizoctonia solani faster than the wt in plate confrontation assays . the complemented strains Δhyd1+ Δhyd3+ showed partial restoration of wt behaviour. furthermore, in order to understand the tolerance of c. rosea strains to the secreted metabolites from the fungal prey, a secretion assay was performed. growth rates of deletion strains were significantly  higher than the wt when grown on agar plates where b. cinerea, f. graminearum or r. solani were pregrown . in addition, the double deletion strain Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> showed significantly  higher growth rate compared to the either single deletion mutant . similarly to the plate confrontation assay, Δhyd1+ and Δhyd3+ strains showed partial restoration of wt growth rates.

in another set of experiments, mycelial biomass of b. cinerea, f. graminearum and r. solani was measured in sterile-filtered culture filtrates of c. rosea wt and deletion strains. a significantly  higher biomass production of b. cinerea, f. graminearum and r. solani was recorded when grown in culture filtrates of hydrophobin deletion strains compared with wt culture filtrate . no differences in fungal biomass production were found between culture filtrates of either single or double mutant strains .

assessment of antagonistic activity of c. rosea strains using a detached leaves assay
a significant  reduction in necrotic lesion area was measured on leaves preinoculated with c. rosea wt compared to control leaves where only b. cinerea was inoculated . in addition, in leaves preinoculated with Δhyd <dig>  Δhyd <dig>  or Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> strains, necrotic lesion areas were significantly  less severe than those observed in wt preinoculated leaves. no difference in necrotic lesion areas were found between leaves preinoculated with either single or double deletion strains .

assessment of c. rosea strains for root colonization ability
arabidopsis thaliana roots, grown on ms plates, were inoculated with c. rosea conidia and allowed to interact for 5 days. water inoculated roots were used as control. after surface sterilization, colonization levels were determined by counting colony forming units . no significant differences in root colonization ability were recorded between wt and the Δhyd <dig> strain. in contrast, root colonization by the Δhyd <dig> strain was significantly  reduced . interestingly, the double deletion Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> strain showed increased  colonization ability compared to wt or single deletion strains .

discussion
filamentous fungi generally contain multiple hydrophobin genes, which play important roles in fungal growth, development and environmental communication  <cit> . we identified only  <dig> class ii hydrophobin genes in the genome of the mycoparasite c. rosea. this is in strong contrast with the closely related mycoparasites t. atroviride and t. virens that contain high numbers  and diversity of class ii hydrophobins  <cit> . this indicate important ecological differences between c. rosea and trichoderma spp., and emphasize that different mycoparasites may rely on different mechanisms of interaction. the expansion of the hydrophobin gene family in trichoderma spp. is hypothesized to help the fungus to attach to the hyphae of a broad range of asco- and basidiomycetes  <cit> .

the high expression of hyd <dig> in conidiating mycelia in comparison with germinating conidia indicates that hyd <dig> may have a role during conidiophore development. this is consistent with the expression pattern of hyd <dig> in m. anisoplia where expression is low in germinating conidia and high in mycelium with conidiophores  <cit> . the expression, but lack of regulation, of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> on different nutrient regimes, and between developmental stages of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  indicate a constitutive role of the corresponding proteins in c. rosea. constitutive roles of hydrophobins in fungal growth and development are reported in many species  <cit> . however, certain hydrophobins from trichoderma spp. and m. brunneum are regulated by nutritional conditions and between different life cycle stages  <cit> .

expression levels of hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> are repressed in c. rosea during interactions with b. cinerea and f. graminearum, which is consistent with the expression pattern of t. atroviride hydrophobin genes hfb-1b, hfb-2c and hfb-6a <cit> . this may suggest that hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> are not involved in protecting hyphae from recognition by other organisms  <cit> . alternatively, the data can also be interpreted as an induction during c. rosea self interaction that may suggest a role for hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> in intraspecific signalling or hyphal fusion. hydrophobins that are known to be involved in interactions with plant leaves and roots are usually highly expressed during these conditions  <cit> . therefore, the low expression of the  <dig> c. rosea hydrophobin genes during barley root colonization indicates that the corresponding proteins may not be necessary for root adhesion and colonization.

deletion of hydrophobin genes from different fungal species often results in variable and sometimes contradicting phenotypes. this is a reflection of the birth-and-death type of evolution of the hydrophobin gene family  <cit> , which results in functionally diverse proteins with many species specific members. this is evident for hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> in c. rosea as gene deletions results in increased growth rate and sporulation, which is in contrast to the reduced sporulation in t. reesei, m. oryzae and m. brunneum due to deletion of the hydrophobin genes hfb <dig> <cit> , mpg <dig> and mhp <dig> <cit>  and hyd <dig>  hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> <cit> , respectively. the situation is even more complicated as deletion of hcf- <dig> and hcf- <dig> in cladosporium fulvum <cit> , cpph <dig> in claviceps purpurea <cit>  and hfb <dig> in t. reesei <cit>  results in no differences in sporulation in comparison with the wt strain.

deletion of hyd <dig> or hyd <dig> does not influence mycelial hydrophobicity in c. rosea, which is consistent with previous reports in c. purpurea, m. brunneum, f. verticilloides and b. cinerea <cit> . however, it seems that hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> are jointly required for conidial hydrophobicity and dispersal, as the conidia from the double deletion mutant Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> clump together in solution and have lower hydrophobicity index than the wt. similar phenotypes are repeatedly reported from many different species  <cit> . furthermore, deletion of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> does not influence the expression levels of hyd <dig>  which suggests that hyd <dig> is subject to different regulatory signals than hyd <dig> and hyd <dig>  failure to delete hyd <dig> despite several trials may suggest an essential function of the corresponding protein.

hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> do not appear to be involved in protection of the c. rosea mycelium during abiotic stress conditions. in contrast, higher conidial germination rates during abiotic stress conditions in hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> mutants suggests that these hydrophobins inhibit conidial germination in environments not suitable for mycelial growth. similar results are shown previously in m. oryzae and the entomopathogenic fungus b. bassiana against thermal stress  <cit> . hence, under unfavourable conditions hydrophobins may act as a sensor for the conidial germination signalling pathway and consequently protect the conidia by limiting its germination until favourable conditions are prevail  <cit> .

the increased growth rate of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion strains under normal conditions such as pda, may explain the faster overgrowth of the fungal prey in plate confrontations and the higher growth rate on plates previously colonized by b. cinerea, f. graminearum or r. solani. similar results are reported previously in t. asperellum, where deletion of tashyd <dig> does not reduce in vitro mycoparasitic ability  <cit> . hydrophobins are highly expressed proteins that may account for up to 10% of the total amount of secreted proteins  <cit> . in c. rosea, deletion of both hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> results in a reduction of the total amount of secreted proteins. despite this, no differences in pathogen biomass production in sterile filtered culture filtrates from single and double deletion strains are recorded. this may suggest that hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> do not exert a direct toxic effect on the fungal prey.

the higher conidial germination rates  and higher growth rates of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> deletion strains may explain the reduced necrotic lesion area, caused by b. cinerea, on a. thaliana leaves preinoculated with the mutant strains in comparison with wt preinoculated leaves. as a consequence, the c. rosea deletion strains may parasitize b. cinerea to a greater extent or simply outcompete it for space or nutrients. hydrophobins in t. asperellum are reported to influence root surface attachment and intercellular root colonization  <cit> . similarly, our results show that hyd <dig> is needed for barley root colonization. unexpectedly, deletion of hyd <dig> in a Δhyd <dig> background increases the root colonization ability. the exact mechanism responsible for this cannot be discerned based on the current data, but we may speculate that it can be related to the lower conidial hydrophobicity or the lower protein secretion of the double deletion strain compared with the hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> single gene deletion strains. in the entomopathogenic fungus b. bassiana, reduced virulence is recorded for a Δhyd <dig> strain, while no effect is observed for a Δhyd <dig> strain. however, the effect of the Δhyd1Δhyd <dig> double deletion mutant on virulence is cumulative and lower than for the single Δhyd <dig> strain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified three class ii hydrophobin genes and characterized their function in the fungal biocontrol agent c. rosea. our results showed a basal expression of all three hydrophobin genes during growth and development and under nutritional stress conditions, although hyd <dig> was induced during conidiation. in addition, all three genes were upregulated during self-interaction compared to the interaction with fungal prey. deletion of c. rosea hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> demonstrate the involvement of the corresponding proteins in controlling conidial germination under unfavourable conditions, and the additive contribution of hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> to conidial hydrophobicity. hyd <dig> was further shown to influence the root colonization ability of c. rosea.
