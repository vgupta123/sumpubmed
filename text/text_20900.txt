BACKGROUND
a key objective of systems biology research is to move from a qualitative to a quantitative understanding of cellular signalling and gene networks. motivated by recent advances in high-throughput genomics and proteomics analysis, and the resulting explosive growth in the amount of data available for analysis, much effort is currently focused on developing reliable methods for inferring the structural and functional organisation of biochemical networks from data obtained by time-series measurements – see for example  <cit>  and references therein.

interactions between components of biological networks can conveniently be represented by weighted, directed graphs, where the nodes correspond to the biochemical components, and the edges, represented as arrows with weights attached, indicate the direct quantitative effect that a change in one component has on another component  <cit> . the weights are, in general, nonlinear functions that represent often largely unknown reaction kinetics, and it is therefore not usually practical to directly determine these weights from experimental data. this is particularly the case for gene networks whose structures are poorly understood in general, even qualitatively. in such cases, a useful approach is to consider the biochemical network behaviour about some steady-state, and assume that it behaves linearly for small deviations from this steady-state  <cit> . with this assumption, the network weights become constants, quantifying the reactions between the components in the neighbourhood of the steady-state. an interaction matrix, known as the jacobian, is then obtained by grouping the constant weights into a matrix.

several different approaches for determining the jacobian of a network from time-series data have recently appeared in the literature  <cit> . a common feature of all these approaches is that the network is perturbed in some way, and then data are collected from time-series measurements of one or more components of the network. in  <cit> , an approach was proposed which can handle very general types of system perturbations, such as gene knockouts and inhibitor additions. for these types of perturbations, the exact size, as well as the direct effect of the perturbations will be largely unknown, and therefore the method also allows the determination of the perturbation itself from the data. another advantage of the approach of  <cit>  is that the effect of unsteady-state initial conditions can be treated as an unknown perturbation and hence also estimated from the data. this removes the requirement for the system to be in a steady-state with known activities and concentrations when the perturbation is applied.

another common feature of almost all the approaches for reverse engineering biomolecular networks so far proposed in the literature is that they employ some estimation algorithm to infer network structure from the measurement data. in  <cit> , for example, the basis of the method for simultaneous estimation of the system states and parameter perturbations is a linear least-squares algorithm. a significant limitation of most such algorithms is that they do not take account of the noise that is inevitably present in the measurement data. indeed, in the results presented in  <cit> , it was observed that significant levels of noise in the measurement data could lead to quite large errors in the estimated jacobian matrix.

in data from most biological experiments, the error associated with each measurement is substantial. the amount of measurement noise is often poorly defined but arises from 1) errors inherent in the measurement technique; 2) errors in the time a measurement is made ; and 3) biological variation in the behaviour of cells or organisms in the assay. inaccuracy in measurements, leading to noise in the data available for analysis, can, in theory, be addressed by improvement of techniques and by replication. in practice, however, improving measurement quality or increasing replication is often not possible because it can involve slower sampling or result in the inclusion of more biological variation . therefore, it is critical to develop analytical approaches which allow robust identification of interactions in biochemical networks from data with a substantial, but poorly-defined, noise component. such approaches are also valuable in reverse, i.e. in suggesting how experimental sampling strategies can be improved to provide optimal data in terms of both number and accuracy of data points.

given the ubiquity of measurement noise in biological data, there is clearly a need for advanced estimation algorithms which can explicitly, and in some sense optimally, take such noise into account when producing estimates of the network interactions. in this paper, we consider two such extensions of the classical least squares  algorithm, namely the total least squares   <cit> , and the constrained total least squares   <cit>  algorithm. the ctls algorithm, in particular, is shown to be ideally suited to the problem of accurately and reliably identifying functional interactions between network components from noisy data. while both of these algorithms are now routinely used in advanced signal and image processing applications, we believe that this is the first time that their usefulness in systems biology has been highlighted.

RESULTS
in this section, the performance of the three algorithms described above is tested on an in silico four-gene network example, on a high fidelity in silico p <dig> and mdm <dig> interaction model and on an example of interleukin - <dig> and il- 12b interactions with activating transcription factor  <dig>  and rel  based on in vivo data.

all computations were performed on a  <dig>  ghz pentium iv machine with  <dig>  gb of ram using windows xp professional, matlab  <dig> , and the matlab optimisation toolbox version  <dig> . <dig>

note that the estimation errors of the tls for the cases of very few data points, i.e.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are larger than the errors from the standard least squares algorithm. this is because, as discussed later in the methods section, the tls algorithm requires a minimum number of data points to work properly. for the case of only  <dig> data points, all three algorithms provide the same result, since in this case the set of equations to be solved is not over-determined, i.e. there is a single unique solution. excluding this case, the ctls reduces the mean of the relative magnitude error for each element of the jacobian, i.e. εm, by an average of 27% compared with the standard least squares technique, over all the different cases considered. this improvement rises to 37% when the four cases with the fewest data points are removed. the variance of the error is reduced by an average of  <dig> %, excluding the first three cases. for the sign estimation error, εs, all three methods give a similar level of performance – the reason for this is easy to see, however, by considering the true jacobian of the network:

clearly, the jacobian contains no terms which are very close to zero and therefore the signs of the estimates for each term will be very similar for all three methods. the ctls almost always gives the best performance in the root mean square sense. a common feature of the results presented in table  <dig> is that the accuracy of the estimate improves with increasing numbers of data points. however, beyond a certain critical number of data points, there is no further improvement in the quality of the estimate using any algorithm. the fact that for certain error measures the estimate dis-improves slightly for a large number of data points is due to the biased nature of the least squares solution. it is well known that when a and b in ax = b are statistically independent, the least square solution has no bias error. however, when they are not independent, which is the case here, the solution has a bias in general. moreover, the level of bias is generally a nonlinear function of the number of measurements and hence the bias error may not decrease monotonically  <cit> . from table  <dig>  it is clear that using too few data points can generate huge errors in the inferred network. however, since the error does not decrease monotonically with larger number of data points, it may be better to increase the accuracy of the data while obtaining fewer data points rather than sacrificing accuracy to obtain many more data points. in this specific case, the optimal number of data points seems to be between  <dig> and  <dig>  finally, to evaluate the effect of drift noise, which is a common form of noise in biochemical measurements, each algorithm was again evaluated using monte-carlo simulations. in this case, the measurements are given by  <cit>

for k =  <dig>   <dig>  ..., l where vk is white noise and bk is the drift noise. the drift noise, which is also called brownian motion or random walk, is modelled as follows:

bk+ <dig> = bk + wkΔt     

for k =  <dig>   <dig>  ..., l -  <dig> where b <dig> equals to  <dig> and wk is white noise. the dimensions of bk and wk are n ×  <dig> and the variance of the i-th element of wk is  <dig> for i =  <dig>   <dig>  ..., n. for this example, n is equal to  <dig>  monte-carlo simulation results for various levels of drift noise are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  for  <dig> and  <dig> data points per experiment, respectively. again, for each case, and for all different levels of drift noise considered, the ctls algorithm generally yields significant reductions in the jacobian estimation error. by comparing tables  <dig> and  <dig>  it can be seen that the errors with  <dig> data points are smaller than the ones with  <dig> data points. however, if the number of data points is increased by too much, adverse effects will occur, as the bias error is stronger as time increases and hence the later data are effected more strongly by bias noise. hence, in the presence of bias noise it is also important to try to choose the optimal number of data points so that the noise does not increase the estimation error too much.

p <dig> and mdm <dig> messenger rna expression
the negative feedback interactions between the tumor suppressor p <dig> and the oncogene mdm <dig> have been the subject of much attention in the recent systems biology literature. p <dig> protein activates mdm <dig> and the mdm <dig> protein in turn negatively regulates p <dig>  forming a negative feedback loop. the nature of the oscillations in p <dig> have been observed to vary significantly from cell to cell. the period and the amplitude variability seem to stem from low frequency noise in the protein production rate,  <cit> . a detailed mathematical model for the single-cell response of p <dig> to ionising radiation, which includes the levels of p <dig> and transcription of the mdm <dig> gene, the corresponding protein levels of mdm <dig> and the activation kinetics of the protein p <dig> and ataxia telangiectasia mutated , is presented in  <cit> . the model accurately replicates the experimentally observed phenomenon that the number, but not the frequency or amplitude, of p <dig> oscillations depends on the radiation dose. the full model includes not only deterministic but also some stochastic dynamics, which represent the stochastic behaviour of the number of double-strand break complexes. to formulate a realistic problem to demonstrate the performance of the constrained total least-squares algorithm, we considered the following scenario: first, the p <dig> activity and mdm <dig> gene expression levels, as shown in figure 7a of  <cit> , are the only measurements available. second, we do not know the activity of atm and other proteins including p <dig>  finally, the relation between these two genes is to be estimated by the jacobian estimation algorithm. the kinetics for the two gene expression levels are given by

il <dig> and il <dig> messenger rna expression
proper regulation of the innate immune system is crucial for host survival, and is mediated, in part, by cytokines that are secreted by macrophages. in particular, breakdown of immune system regulatory mechanisms can lead to inflammatory disease. immune system control is extraordinarily complex, making it an obvious candidate for investigation using systems biology approaches. the biochemical network through which interleukin - <dig> and il- 12b interact with activating transcription factor  <dig>  and rel  forms an important part of the innate immune system response  <cit> . a kinetic model for the expression of il <dig> mrna by atf <dig> and rel was recently proposed in  <cit>  as follows:

CONCLUSIONS
we have considered the problem of identifying the dynamic interactions in biochemical networks from noisy data. since time-series measurements of, for example, concentrations and expression profiles in gene networks, are almost guaranteed to be corrupted by significant levels of noise, algorithms are required which explicitly take this noise into account when computing estimates of quantitative interactions in biochemical networks. the tls and ctls algorithms are extensions of the widely used least squares approach which optimally deal with the presence of uncorrelated and correlated noise in the measurements, respectively. since noise in time-series measurements from biological experiments are generally correlated, the ctls approach is ideally suited to estimation problems of this type.

the superior performance of the ctls method in identifying network interactions was demonstrated on three examples: a genetic network containing four genes, a high fidelity p <dig> and mdm <dig> interaction network, and a recently proposed kinetic model for interleukin - <dig> and -12b messenger rna expression as a function of atf <dig> and nf-κb promoter binding. for the first example, the ctls has significantly reduced the errors in the estimation of the jacobian for the gene network. for the second, the ctls shows similarly superior performance over the other least-squares methods to estimate the jacobian from the measurements of a high fidelity gene network with neglected kinetics. for the third, it has allowed the correct identification, from noisy data, of the negative regulation of - <dig> and -12b by atf <dig>  the ability to take into account errors from various noise sources when identifying biochemical networks is valuable in informing decisions about the optimal numbers of data measurements that are required. while the use of very few data points generates huge errors, the errors do not decrease monotonically with much larger numbers of points. thus, the calculations presented in this paper provide a rational basis for the design of experiments, in particular regarding the required frequency and accuracy of sampling. this is a very important issue in practice, since for some experiments there will be a practical upper limit on the number of data points per experiment . secondly, the number of data points is often a trade-off with accuracy of the measurements. typically, one would schedule a single day to do an experiment and then the choice is often between making more, noisier measurements or fewer, more accurate ones 

the excellent performance of the ctls method compared to ls and tls approaches  under the wide range of conditions tested here – including different levels of noise, different numbers of data points, and with drift – suggests that its application will enable better identification and modelling of biochemical networks. in the future, explicit analysis with the ctls method is likely to increase the number of parameters that can be included in a model, even where there is limited knowledge of the noise levels and their source.
