BACKGROUND
chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga, capable of both photosynthetic and fermentative growth. a plethora of mutants in relevant biological processes are available, and nuclear and chloroplast transformation are easy to perform  <cit> . its 120-megabase genome has been completely sequenced  <cit> . chlamydomonas combines functions typical of higher plants, such as the presence of a chloroplast endowed with two photosystems  <cit> , of protozoa, such as the presence of motile flagella for swimming  <cit> , and of archaea, such as the presence of sensory rhodopsins mediating phototaxis  <cit> .

flagellar motility in chlamydomonas is dependent on dynein motors, which drive microtubule sliding, and a multitude of accessory proteins that control dynein activity, including radial spokes and the central pair complex. immotile mutants missing individual subunits of these components have been identified and, in many cases, rescued by introducing the corresponding wild-type gene driven by its native promoter  <cit> . the first case of such complementation was achieved in a mutant, pf <dig>  which has paralyzed flagella due to a premature stop codon in the gene encoding radial spoke protein  <dig>   <cit> . rsp <dig> encodes a protein mediating the anchoring to the axoneme of a camp-dependent protein kinase that regulates axonemal motility and dynein activity  <cit> . flagellar motility can be restored by transformation of the mutant with the wild-type rsp <dig> gene  <cit> , thus providing a nice biological assay for activity of the promoter driving rsp <dig> transcription.

several chemically regulated promoters have been described in chlamydomonas: the nitrate reductase  promoter, induced by ammonium starvation  <cit> ; the carbonic anhydrase  promoter, induced by low co <dig>  <cit> ; and the cytochrome c <dig>  promoter, induced by copper  depletion or nickel  addition  <cit> . in all three cases, inducible expression has been demonstrated using reporter genes such as arylsulfatase or luciferase and, in the case of the nit <dig> promoter, through complementation of a paralyzed flagellar mutant, pf <dig>  by expressing the wild type form of the rsp <dig> gene  <cit> . no data are available, to our knowledge, on the capacity of the cah <dig> and cyc <dig> inducible promoters to drive complementation of chlamydomonas mutants.

to assess the capacity of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters to complement the pf <dig> mutation in a chemically regulated fashion, we transformed the paralyzed pf <dig> mutant with the rsp <dig> gene under the control of the above-mentioned promoters and scored the swimming phenotype. the strong constitutive psad promoter  <cit>  was used as a control.

RESULTS
constructs used for chemically inducible complementation
the complete rsp <dig> gene  was translationally fused to a 9-amino acid ha epitope at its 3' end, to facilitate the immunodetection of the expressed protein  <cit> . the rsp3-ha hybrid gene was placed under the control of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters, induced, respectively, by ni and low co <dig>  <cit>  and, as a control, of the strong constitutive psad promoter  <cit> . the constructs are schematically represented in figure  <dig> 

constitutive complementation of the pf <dig> mutant driven by the psad promoter
the pf <dig> mutant strain was transformed with the psad:rsp3-ha plasmid and  <dig> paromomycin-resistant transformants were grown for  <dig> hours without shaking in the light. upon microscopic examination, about 40% of the transformants showed swimming cells. the average percentage of swimming cells was about 80% . this result shows that the rsp3-ha fusion protein is able to rescue the pf <dig> mutant. the data of a representative transformant are shown in figure  <dig>  the majority of the cells  were flagellated and motile  and strong signals corresponding to the unphosphorylated  and phosphorylated  forms of the rsp3-ha protein were detected in a western blot using the anti-ha antibody .

in this experiment  <dig> transformants were analyzed for each construct.

chemically inducible complementation of pf <dig> driven by the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters
pf <dig> cells were transformed with the cyc6:rsp3-ha and the cah1:rsp3-ha plasmids and  <dig> transformed colonies were analyzed for each construct. before analysis, the cyc6:rsp3-ha transformants were inoculated in tap enea <dig> medium, allowing optimal expression of the cyc <dig> promoter, and expression was induced in the mid-log phase  by adding  <dig> μm ni  <cit> . we used a rather low ni concentration, since higher concentrations cause detachment of flagella, preventing the scoring of the swimming phenotype . the swimming phenotype was scored  <dig> hours after induction, when cyc <dig> promoter expression is maximal  <cit> . approximately 8% of the transformants displayed swimming  and, in these transformants, an average of 5% of the cells were motile. this difference with respect to the psad:rsp3-ha transformants is due to two factors: a much lower percentage of cells are flagellated in the cyc6:rsp3-ha transformants  and, of these, a lower percentage are swimming . as discussed below, we attribute this difference to a threshold effect. movies of psad:rsp3-ha and cyc6:rsp3-ha transformants are available as additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

in order to prevent loss of flagella at high cell densities , cells were also induced with  <dig> μm ni in early log phase , but no rescue was observed . this is consistent with the observation of quinn et al.  <cit>  that activation of the cyc <dig> promoter is stronger when the cells are induced at mid-late log phase, probably because ni uptake is higher.

the cah1:rsp3-ha transformants were grown in air containing 5% co <dig>  in minimal medium supplemented with extra phosphate buffer to keep the ph stable. expression of the cah <dig> promoter was induced in early-log phase by transferring the plate to air and cells were scored for swimming  <dig> hours after induction, when the cah <dig> promoter shows high expression  <cit> . approximately 7% of the transformants showed swimming and, as for the cyc6:rsp3-ha transformants, approximately 5% of the cells were motile in the rescued transformants .

the percentage of swimming and flagellated-immotile cells was determined for two representative cyc6:rsp3-ha transformants showing restored motility,  <dig> hours after ni addition , when the cyc <dig> promoter shows high expression  <cit>  and cell density is high . the percentage of swimming cells was about 5% in both cases, whereas the flagellated/immotile cells ranged between 5% and 8%. loss of flagella is independent of addition of ni at  <dig> μm, since it is observed also in the non-induced transformants at high cell densities . cell density-dependent loss of flagella is not observed in wild type or psad:rsp3-ha transformants, suggesting that continuous, or high level, expression of rsp <dig> prevents this phenomenon.

the percentage of swimming cells in two representative cah1:rsp3-ha transformants was determined  <dig> hours after transfer to low co <dig> , when the cah <dig> promoter shows high expression  <cit> . in this case, cell density was low  and the percentage of flagellated cells was high . however, as for the cyc6:rsp3-ha transformants, the percentage of motile cells was low .

kinetics of induction of the swimming phenotype
we then determined the kinetics of appearance of swimming cells in one representative cyc6:rsp3-ha and one cah1:rsp3-ha transformant . in the case of the cyc <dig> promoter, swimming cells were observed as early as  <dig> hours after ni addition. at  <dig> hours the number of swimming cells reached a maximum and then decreased at  <dig> hours. this is in agreement with the kinetics of activation of the cyc <dig> promoter, measured with the luciferase reporter gene, which reaches maximum activity after two days of induction and then decreases at three days  <cit> . in the cah1:rsp3-ha transformant, swimming cells were observed as early as  <dig> hours after transfer to low co <dig>  the maximum number of swimming cells was reached  <dig> hours after transfer, and then declined at  <dig> hours. however, considering the standard deviations at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, this decline is not significant.

discussion
through the use of the chemically regulated cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters and of a genomic rsp <dig> clone fused to an ha epitope, we have achieved the chemically regulated motility of chlamydomonas cells. while the vast majority of cells showed motility when rsp <dig> expression was driven by the constitutive psad promoter, only a minority  of cells showed motility after induction of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters. this is probably due to a threshold effect: the levels of rsp3-ha protein driven by psad are much higher than those driven by cyc <dig> and cah <dig>  the low levels of rsp3-ha protein expressed from the cah <dig> promoter after  <dig> hours of induction contrast markedly with the high levels of cah <dig> protein expressed from the endogenous gene . low expression of exogenously introduced constructs in chlamydomonas is a well-known phenomenon, which has been attributed to gene silencing  <cit> .

the low levels of rsp3-ha protein expressed from the cyc <dig> promoter after  <dig> hours of induction are also puzzling, since, in tap enea <dig> medium, the cyc <dig> promoter is able to drive levels of luciferase expression comparable to those driven by psad  <cit> . we attribute this difference in rsp <dig> vs luciferase expression to the fact that rsp <dig> accumulates over time when it is expressed from psad, while expression for  <dig> hours  or  <dig> hours  allows accumulation of low rsp <dig> levels . this implies that the rsp <dig> protein is more stable than luciferase . whatever the case, the low levels of expressed rsp3-ha protein are sufficient for achieving motility in 5% of the transformed cells. to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters for achieving chemically regulated complementation of a chlamydomonas mutant, as well as the first example of metal- or co2-regulated motility engineered in a living organism. the partial complementation observed is probably due to the fact that the rsp <dig> protein, to exert its function, is required in high concentrations. although the number of radial spokes required to restore motility to flagella is not known, each wild type flagellum contains approximately  <dig>  radial spokes  <cit> .

zhang and lefebvre  <cit>  have used the rsp <dig> gene under the control of the ammonium-repressible nit <dig> promoter to complement the pf <dig> mutant in a nitrogen source-dependent fashion. in that study,  <dig> out of  <dig>  cotransformants showed motility in permissive conditions, i.e. a fraction of about 4%, comparable to the 7-8% reported here for the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters. at least one of the transformants, containing multiple copies of the nit1:rsp <dig> plasmid, showed full complementation, i.e. a large number of swimming cells, a fact we did not encounter in the case of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters, probably due to the smaller number of colonies screened in our study and to the fact that the vast majority of the insertions, in our case, are single-copy . whatever the case, the frequency of swimming transformants obtained with the strong psad promoter is 40% , i.e. much higher than what can be obtained using either the nit <dig>  cyc <dig>  or cah <dig> promoters in permissive conditions. a chemically regulated promoter system allowing such high complementation efficiencies in permissive conditions has yet to be worked out.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated low level, chemically regulated complementation of the paralyzed flagella pf <dig> mutant by the rsp <dig> gene, encoding a component of the flagellar radial spoke complex, cloned under the control of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters. maximum complementation is reached with very different kinetics . in principle, these promoters should be capable of fully complementing mutants in genes whose products exert their biological activity at low concentrations . test of this hypothesis is under way, as well as the optimization of the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters, for full complementation of mutants in genes encoding abundant intracellular proteins.
