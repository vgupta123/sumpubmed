BACKGROUND
spinal cord injury  creates an environment enriched in factors that inhibit axonal regeneration including myelin proteins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that has been extensively reviewed  <cit> . the supraspinal pathways most often tested after sci for their regenerative ability , have limited inherent regenerative abilities, even when more permissive environments are established at the injury site  <cit> . one factor related to the limited regeneration of supraspinal axons is the long distance between the site of axotomy and their cell bodies of origin. previous studies have demonstrated neurons mount a stronger regenerative response if axotomy occurs closer to the cell body  <cit> . this may be why propriospinal  axons, from neurons intrinsic to the spinal cord, show greater regenerative ability than supraspinal nerve tracts when the same experimental strategies are used to increase regeneration after sci  <cit> .

in concert with supraspinal nerve tracts, ps neurons play an important role in locomotor function, limb coordination, and postural support  <cit> . in spite of their importance in spinal motor function, as well as their greater regenerative potential, and potential for post-injury axonal plasticity  <cit> , ps neurons have been relatively understudied. preliminary studies from our laboratory show an initial large loss of thoracic ps  neurons two weeks following moderate t9- <dig> spinal contusion injury , but ~30% of axotomized tps neurons remain rostral to this injury for at least one month, as assessed by prelabeling these cells from the lumbosacral spinal cord prior to spinal injury  <cit> . the present investigation is a detailed analysis of the cellular response of tps neurons after low thoracic complete sci. we paid particular attention to changes related to their regenerative ability and to early cell loss, based on the hypothesis that the short distance from the lesion would ensure a maximal regenerative response.

using whole-transcriptome profiling with microarrays, followed by qrt-pcr and immunohistochemistry for validation, we found a strong initial inflammatory response as well as an early regeneration and cell death response. an up-regulation of several growth factor receptors, as well as a down-regulation of receptors to several factors that inhibit axonal growth may indicate potential therapeutic treatments to protect tps neurons from early cell death post-axotomy and to maximize and sustain the early regenerative response.

methods
the suny upstate medical university committee for the humane use of animals, following the provisions and guidelines set forth by the institutional department of laboratory animal research and the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care , approved all procedures involving the use of animals.

female hooded long-evans rats  approximately  <dig> days  old were used in this study. animals were assigned to various labeling, injury, and survival time-points .

female long-evans rat were divided among  <dig> groups. then using the indicated tracer, fluorogold  or dextran tetramethyl rhodamine , tps neurons were prelabeled by a series of bilateral injections into the upper lumbrosacral enlargement. following 1-week tracer transport time, animals in groups 4- <dig> were subjected to either a t <dig> complete spinal transection  or moderate spinal contusion injury . animals were then allowed to recover for different periods post-injury as indicated. n used in analysis indicates the number of animals that were used in the data analysis part of this study.  group  <dig> only has an n of  <dig> due to  <dig> animal failing to pass the microarray's internal quality control, and the loss of  <dig> animal to freezing artifact during histological processing.  group  <dig> only has an n of  <dig> due to premature animal mortality. the final column of this table indicates the time point comparisons that were made for both the gene and pcr validation studies conducted during this study.

animal surgeries
retrograde labelling of thoracic propriospinal  neurons
animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal  injection of a ketamine/xylazine cocktail . once the animal was areflexic, a laminectomy was performed at the t- <dig> vertebral level exposing the upper lumbosacral enlargement. the spinal cord was exposed using a 26g needle to open the dura. injections of retrograde label  were made using a  <dig> μl hamilton syringe  with a micropipette tip  glued to the syringe needle. the syringe was attached to a micrometer injection apparatus seated in a stereotaxic frame. a total of six  <dig>  μl fluorogold  or dextran tetramethyl rhodamine  <dig>  m.w.  injections were made bilaterally centered within the intermediate gray matter  at the rostral, middle, and caudal aspects of the laminectomy site. the needle penetrated through the dorsal surface of the spinal cord for a distance of  <dig> mm on either side near the midline, and was then withdrawn  <dig> μm before beginning the injection. the injection was made over  <dig> minutes, leaving the needle in place for  <dig> minute prior to retraction to limit leakage of label.

spinal transection
one-week post-retrograde labeling, animals in experimental groups receiving a spinal transection were again anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. a laminectomy was performed at the t <dig> vertebral level. once the spinal cord was exposed a pair of iridectomy scissors  was used to transect the cord, and with a successful transection the rostral and caudal edges of the cut spinal cord retracted exposing the underlying vertebrae. following transection, a probe was scraped along the inner wall of the vertebral canal through the lesion site to further ensure a complete lesion. gelfoam soaked in  <dig> % isotonic saline was used to stop any bleeding.

spinal contusion
after appropriate tracer transport time , animals were anesthetized with an ip injection of sodium pentobarbital . once areflexic, a laminectomy was performed at the t9/t <dig> vertebral level exposing the lower thoracic spinal cord. the animal was positioned and secured into the frame of an nyu impactor by clamping the t <dig> and t <dig> spinous processes, followed by a moderate spinal contusion injury, dropping a  <dig> g rod from a height of  <dig> mm using the mascis protocol  <cit> . successful injuries were determined by the impactor analysis, visual inspection of the lesion under the surgical microscope, and complete acute loss of hindlimb responses after recovery from anesthesia.

post-operative care
following each surgical labeling or sci procedure, animals were sutured using  <dig>  silk to close the musculature, and  <dig>  nylon to close the skin; external sutures were removed after the first week post-operatively. all spinal injured animals received twice daily bladder expression until the micturition reflex returned, and injections of cefazolin  were given twice daily for the first week following spinal injury to prevent urinary tract infections, or when infections occurred. buprenorphine hydrochloride  was given twice daily for the first  <dig> hrs post-operatively for pain management. all post-operative animals had ad libitum access to both food and water.

histology
fg tissue
following the assigned post-operative recovery time, animals were euthanized by an ip injection of sodium pentobarbital  and then decapitated. the mid thoracic spinal cord, t5-t <dig>  was rapidly dissected, embedded in o.c.t compound , and rapidly frozen on dry ice. tissue samples were stored at -80°c until processing. tissue sections were cut transversely at  <dig> μm using a cryostat and mounted on glass superfrost plus slides  or poly-ethylennaphtalae  foil slides  and maintained at -20°c during the sectioning process. slides were stored at -80°c until laser microdissection .

dtmr tissue
animals were euthanized by an injection of sodium pentobarbital , and transcardially perfused with  <dig> ml  <dig>  m  <dig> × pbs  followed by  <dig> ml 4% paraformaldehyde . spinal cords were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> hours followed by cryoprotection in 20% sucrose for a minimum of  <dig> hours. tissue samples were embedded in o.c.t compound  and frozen on dry ice. tissue samples were stored at -20°c throughout sectioning and storage. cryostat sections were cut in the transverse plane at a thickness of  <dig> μm, and slides containing tissue sections were stored at -20°c until further processing.

immunohistochemistry
retrogradely labelled dtmr-tps neurons were probed immunohistochemically for various neurotrophic receptors , a marker of cell stress , a protein involved in axon regeneration , and a marker of cell death . all retrogradely labeled tissue was incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°c. secondary labeling of gfrα <dig> and ret was bioamplified, and visualized using strepavidin-fitc conjugate 1: <dig> in avidin buffer. secondary antibody detection of all other primary antibodies used either a goat anti-rabbit or mouse - fitc conjugate  or goat anti-rabbit marina blue . all sides were coverslipped with vectasheild .

microarray techniques
laser microdissection
tissue was mounted on poly-ethylennaphtalae  foil slides  that were maintained on dry ice until laser microdissection. once a slide was removed from the dry ice, neurons were dissected over a period of  <dig> minutes. slides were positioned on the stage of a leica as lmd microscope . retrogradely labeled fg-tps cells were visualized under the uv filter using the  <dig> × objective . using the microscope's computer software, fg labeled cells located within the intermediate gray matter  were individually dissected ; a minimum of  <dig> fg labeled neurons were collected from each animal.

rna purification & amplification
dissected neurons were collected directly into a pcr tube cap containing  <dig> μl rlt lysis buffer  with 1% β-marcaptoethanol . rna was then purified using the rneasy mini kit , eluted in  <dig> μl nuclease free water, and concentrated down to  <dig> μl by vacuum centrifugation. total rna concentration was determined by loading  <dig> μl of concentrated sample onto an rna  <dig> pico chip . acceptable rna samples  were amplified and labeled using the ovation™ biotin rna amplification and labeling system , producing a  <dig>  fold amplification of the mrna. using the basic 3' ribo-spia™ , the mrna was then used to produce an enriched anti-sense cdna probe for hybridization to the rat gene  <dig>  st array .

microarray hybridization
all microarray processing was performed using standard hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning protocols in the suny microarray core lab at upstate medical university. following scanning, the raw array images were converted to .cel file images for downstream analysis. all the array data for this study have been deposited at the ncbi gene ascension omnibus 

rt-pcr
the reverse transcriptase reaction to convert the rna probes into first strand cdna for pcr was carried out using the rt <dig> first strand kit  following the manufacturer's directions and using the supplied reagents for each rna sample. pcr was performed using the rt <dig> sybr green qpcr master mix and rt <dig> profiler™ pcr array for rat neurotrophins and receptors  following the manufacturers directions and using the supplied reagents. pcr plates were run on a roche  <dig> lightcycler.

imaging and data analysis
fluorescent microscopy
all images were taken on a zeiss axio imager a. <dig> microscope . dtmr labeling was viewed under a cy <dig> filter, while the immunohistochemistry was viewed under either a fitc or dapi filter. all images were captured using a spot rt slider camera, model  <dig> . <dig> . all digitized images where processed in the spot™ advanced software , using the rgb color histogram tool to adjust both the image brightness and contrast. no other manipulations were made to these images.

microarray
quantile-normalized expression values were obtained for all genes using rma normalization of the .cel file data in genespring gx  and selected data formatted for import into microarray experiment viewer  <dig>    <cit> . significant changes in expression of single genes were detected using a 2-way anova to compare the effects of treatment across four time-points post surgery. the resulting p values from the main effect anova were corrected for multiple testing using the benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  algorithm.

because the study design included assessments of expression changes at four discrete time-points post-sci, we also chose to provide an overview of the genes with the most robust changes at any one or more particular time-points, whether or not that change generalized across all time-points. thus, we compiled a table that contained lists of the genes with the largest significant increases in expression and the largest significant decreases in expression at one or more of the four time-points . from these lists, we selected the  <dig> genes with the largest increases and  <dig> genes with the largest decreases for hierarchical clustering and heat map visualization.

in addition to the hypothesis-free analysis of genome-wide expression data, we also determined whether there were significant expression changes in three specific custom-designed gene networks that we hypothesized would be critically involved in the response to injury. these networks included:  regeneration associated genes and cell-survival and neuroprotection genes ;  surface receptor and growth factor  genes; and  apoptosis genes. complete lists of the genes in each of these networks are provided in the additional data section. each network was compiled from only genes with expression values exceeding the lowest  <dig> percentile of all genes on the array. within each network, significance was determined by permutation of the 2-factor  anova matrix, with a p value cutoff of  <dig>  based on  <dig> permutations within mev  <dig> .

to determine the evidence for enrichment of significantly changed genes in specific biological pathways or gene networks, ingenuity pathway assist  software  was utilized. data sets for each time-point were uploaded to ipa consisting of all the genes changed at the benjamini-hochberg fdr-corrected p value of  <dig>  or less. these data sets were then filtered using ipa software to include only those genes which were annotated as expressed in any nervous tissue or immune cell as well as changed in expression by at least +/-  <dig>  on a log <dig> scale. the top bio functions results were complied from each of the ipa analyses  for all gene networks containing  <dig> or more genes. corrected significance values for each gene that mapped to these bio function networks were generated by ipa. selected gene networks that showed up in multiple time-point analyses were used to generate biological interaction network/pathway diagrams in ipa for comparative purposes .

qrt-pcr
the average cp value for each gene of interest , both in non-injured controls and spinally transected animals, was calculated and then compared to a given set of reference genes included on the plate to give us the Δcp value. for each goi the Δcp value of the spinally transected group value was subtracted from the mean Δcp value of the control group to yield the ΔΔcp, from which the directional and fold change in our goi were determined. pcr validation of our goi was performed by plotting the log <dig> difference of the lesion versus control groups for both the pcr data and microarray data, and subsequently determining the pearson correlation between the expression changes determined using these two approaches.

RESULTS
gene-microarray analysis of the tps intrinsic response to axotomy
hypothesis -free single gene analysis
we first initiated a genome wide, hypothesis free analysis to examine the overall response of tps neurons to axotomy following a low thoracic spinal transection. the genes with significant main effects of sci were used for subsequent gene network analyses. in addition, we compiled lists of the genes with the most robust increases or decreases in expression at one or more of the four time-points . out of these lists, the expression profiles of the top  <dig> genes both up and down regulated are illustrated in figure  <dig> following hierarchical clustering, and listed in table  <dig> 

top  <dig> tps neuron genes found to be up-regulated following a t <dig> complete transection. examination of the genes found to be up-regulated revealed a majority of them to be involved with either the inflammatory or immune response. this list has the genes ranked according to their log <dig> change, and has been edited from the overall master list  to exclude non-coding rna sequences.  known/presumed functions were obtained from the crown human genome center & weizmann institute of science website genecards® which can be accessed at http://www.genecards.org/index.shtml

the pattern of gene expression  illustrates that the most significant change occurs 3-days post injury , and begins to wane by 1-week p.i. . at the 1-month time-point  the expression levels for most genes appear to return near the level of uninjured control animals. initially, genes exhibiting a significant down-regulation appear to be mainly involved with different aspects of neuronal cell biology , with no one aspect of cell biology being heavily represented. the genes exhibiting the strongest up-regulation are primarily involved with the immune/inflammatory response , or cell maintenance/survival/stress .

top  <dig> down-regulated genes encompass broad functions of cell biology with no one specific function being heavily represented. this list has the genes ranked according to their log <dig> change, and has been edited from the overall master list  to exclude non-coding rna sequences.  known/presumed functions were obtained from the crown human genome center & weizmann institute of science website genecards® which can be accessed at http://www.genecards.org/index.shtml

hypothesis-based gene network analyses
we also determined which biological pathways or gene networks are most consistently affected in tps neurons following spinal transection using ingenuity pathway assist  software  to map those genes with significant main effects across all time-points. three days p.i.  <dig> biological pathways/gene networks containing  <dig> genes are significantly affected with the top  <dig> being: antigen presentation , inflammatory response , immune cell tracking , hematological system development and function , cell to cell signaling and interaction , and cell-mediated immune response   the same gene can be involved in more than one related pathway/network). by one week p.i, there is a much more focused response with only  <dig> pathways/gene networks significantly affected containing many fewer genes  than at 3-days p.i.. there is also a large shift from immune related genes to genes involved in nervous system development  cellular growth and proliferation , and neurological disease . only  <dig> of  <dig> significantly changed genes in the nervous system development and function category at 3-days p.i. are among those changed 1-week p.i.. similarly only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes changed in the cellular growth and proliferation category at 3-days p.i. and  <dig> of  <dig> genes changed in the neurological disease category are among the genes changed at 1-week p.i. in these categories. the gene in these later two categories is casp <dig> 

by two weeks p.i. there was a significantly expanded response with  <dig> gene networks comprised of  <dig> genes being affected according to the ipa analysis. the top  <dig> pathways/networks involved are hematological system development and function , cellular movement , and inflammatory response . only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes changed in the hematological development and function at 3-days p.i. are among the  <dig> genes significantly changed in this category at 2-weeks. similarly only  <dig> of  <dig> genes significantly changed at 3-days p.i. in the cellular movement category are among the  <dig> genes changed at 2-weeks p.i.. only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes significantly changed in the inflammatory response category at 3-days p.i. is among the  <dig> genes changed in this category at 2-weeks p.i..

at  <dig> month p.i.,  <dig> genes involved in  <dig> different gene pathways/networks were significantly changed. the top three networks are nervous system development and function , neurological disease , and cell death . again, few of the  <dig> genes significantly changed in the nervous system development and function category at 1-month p.i. are also changed at 3-days , at 1-week , or at 2-weeks p.i. , and only atf <dig> is changed at all the time-points other than 1-week p.i.. many of the significantly changed genes in the other two categories at 2-weeks p.i. are found in both categories at this survival time since they overlap in function. however few of these genes were significantly changed at earlier survival times.  <dig> genes are also significantly changed at 1-month p.i. in the hematological development and function category compared to control expression level. again, only  <dig> of  <dig> genes in this category at 3-days p.i. is also changed at 1-month p.i.

ipa biological pathway/network analysis
gene networks expressed commonly at all four post-injury time-points  were further explored by composing functional biological network/pathway analysis using ipa software . these pathways allowed us to observe how each gene in a pathway interacts with one another, and how, over time, the expression of these genes and the sub-cellular localization of each of the molecules changes. for example, the specific gene network illustrated in figure  <dig> shows how genes regulating cell death interact with each other, and how their expression  changes from 3-days p.i.  to 1-month p.i. . this specific gene network illustrates that 3-days following injury, brain derived neurotrophic factor  is down-regulated, while the pro-apoptotic gene caspase <dig>  is upregulated. these two genes exhibit an inverse relationship with bdnf increasing in expression and casp <dig> decreasing in expression 1-month p.i.. this pathway also illustrates the interactions of casp <dig> with protein kinase c delta, , which has been demonstrated to be involved with apoptosis, and with ataxia telangiectasia mutated , thought to be activated upon signaling of apoptotic stresses.

custom-designed gene network analysis
in addition to an undirected  evaluation of the top changed genes and biological pathways, three custom-designed gene lists were generated to test whether these genes were specifically affected by axotomy/spinal injury; regeneration associated/cell stress and neuroprotection genes, growth factor genes, and apoptosis-related genes . once the gene lists were run through a 2-way anova  we observed a significant change in expression in only  <dig> out of a total  <dig> genes in three groups of interest , the greatest percentage were in the rags/csnp gene list. we determined if there was statistical evidence for over-representation of significantly changed genes in these groups based on a hypergeometric p value . for the entire set of  <dig>  permuted genes examined, only  <dig> were changed at the . <dig> alpha level using our  <dig> way anova  as described in the materials and methods. this compares to  <dig> significantly changed rag/csnp genes out of  <dig> tested ,  <dig> significantly changed growth factor genes out of  <dig> tested , and  <dig> significantly changed apoptosis genes out of  <dig> tested . this hypergeometric analysis indicates that the  <dig>  fold greater enrichment in the rag/csnp genes was highly significant  whereas there was no overall change in growth factor receptor genes  and significantly fewer genes were found in the apoptosis gene group than expected by chance alone . the under-representation of apoptosis genes indicates that only a small number of these genes is affected by spinal injury, all of which were pro-apoptosis . in fact, this finding was also indicated by the ipa analysis .

thoracic propriospinal neurons upregulate both regeneration associated and neuroprotective survival genes following a low thoracic axotomy
our list of regeneration associated genes  and cell survival and neuroprotection  genes was compiled using the query search available on the affymetrix netaffx website http://affymetrix.com as well as genes selected from the axonal regeneration and cell survival/neuroprotection literature. we analyzed the response of  <dig> genes of interest . goi that exhibited significant changes in expression were selected using a two-factor anova analysis  with significance set at the p ≤  <dig>  level based on  <dig> permutations.

fourteen of the  <dig> goi exhibited a significant change in expression for at least one out of the four time-point comparisons . eleven of the  <dig> genes  were involved with the process of regeneration, while the other  <dig> genes  were mainly involved with cell survival and neuroprotection, although hspb <dig> also has been associated with axonal regeneration  <cit> . all  <dig> genes exhibited a strong up-regulation in expression 3-days post injury  that was diminished by 1-week post injury . furthermore when the change in gene expression 1-week p.i. was compared to the expression level of the appropriate control, no significant  change was detected. however, despite the lack of statistical significance in the changes of gene expression, the array data reveal that the levels of expression in the injured neurons remain elevated above those observed in controls throughout the later p.i. periods for many of the rag and csnp genes.

thoracic propriospinal neurons up-regulate several neurotrophic receptors and down-regulate several receptors inhibitory to axonal growth
the goi  list that was complied for surface receptors and neurotrophic agents used the query search available on the affymetrix netaffx website. this goi list also contained genes for growth factors and extracellular matrix  molecules. the final compiled goi list contained a total of  <dig> genes  and was analyzed using the 2-factor anova to determine which genes demonstrated a significant change in expression. eight of the  <dig> genes demonstrated a significant change in expression following injury . five of the  <dig> genes were up-regulated ;  <dig> are surface receptor genes  that can bind potent neurotrophic or growth promoting ligands i.e., glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor  or leukemia inhibitory factor . gdnf and lif have been shown to promote neuron survival and/or axonal sprouting/regeneration  <cit> . the fifth gene is for a potent growth factor  associated with axonal regeneration  <cit> . three genes exhibited a significant down-regulation following axotomy: fgf <dig>  which is commonly associated with nervous system development  <cit> ; unc5a, involved with mediating repulsive axonal guidance cues; and lingo <dig>  which negatively regulates the process of myelination  <cit> . lingo <dig> is also a member of the surface receptor complex that mediates the inhibitory cues mediated by myelin proteins, hindering the process of axonal regeneration  <cit> . the surface receptor expression profiles  for these genes also exhibit a pattern of expression similar to what was observed in the rag and csnp genes . all  <dig> genes showed a strong change in expression 3-days p.i.  which started to wane 1-week p.i. , and eventually approached the expression levels found in controls by one month p.i. .

thoracic propriospinal neurons upregulate many pro-apoptotic genes following low thoracic axotomy
using the affymetrix website, a query search for pro-, anti-, and apoptosis-related genes was conducted resulting in a compiled list of  <dig> genes . following analysis using 2-factor anova, only  <dig> genes  of the  <dig> complied exhibited a significant  change in expression following transection injury. however,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were up-regulated, while only  <dig> gene was down-regulated following axotomy . the genes up-regulated following injury are all pro-apoptotic . these genes either inhibit cell growth inducing apoptosis, gadd 45γ; activate the caspase cascade resulting in apoptosis, casp3; accelerate cellular apoptosis by antagonizing the bcl <dig> apoptotic repressor, bax; promote apoptosis via activation of caspase  <dig>  pycard; or have been documented to be pro-apoptotic or indicative of apoptosis, bard <dig> and dap. the one down-regulated gene, also pro-apoptotic, was apoptosis-inducing factor, siva <dig>

the expression pattern of the apoptotic genes again followed the overall pattern for the other specific goi described above: i.e. expression was highly up- or down-regulated 3-days post axotomy, but diminished 1-week post axotomy returning to levels similar to those found in the control animals, in most cases by the second week post-sci. the ipa analysis of the cell death network described above also shows some of the details of the apoptotic response that were described earlier .

validation of the gene expression array using qrt-pcr
for validation of the microarray data, we selected the sa biosciences rat neurotrophin pcr array . this array was chosen because it contained pre-validated primer sets for three reference genes  that were unchanged in our array data, six genes that showed a benjamini-hochberg corrected significant effect of treatment , as well as several other neurotrophin-related genes that showed a nominally significant effect of treatment  that did not survive fdr correction . the pcr array results confirmed the significant changes in expression seen for the six genes with significant effects of treatment in the microarray analysis, as well as for three genes with nominally significant treatment effects.

for each of the nine genes listed above we next sought to make direct comparisons at each time-point between the microarray and pcr array findings. this was accomplished by compiling the log <dig> differences in expression that were determined by both techniques, calculating a pearson correlation between these values, and testing for significant treatment effects at each time-point in both data sets with a student's t test . in general, we observed relatively strong correlation between the changes in gene expression observed with both techniques . when the microarray and pcr array data for the top three correlated genes were plotted , the observed expression patterns were highly similar confirming the results of the correlation analysis .

as summarized in figure 5g, the microarray and pcr array data corroborate each other. the  <dig> genes examined showed a significant change in expression 3-days post axotomy. four of these genes  demonstrated both a significant change in expression and a correlated expression trend in both arrays, while the remaining  <dig> genes  showed a significant change in expression in either the pcr array or microarray but still demonstrated a correlated mean relative expression trend. at one week post-axotomy, many of the significant changes in expression were lost according to pcr array analysis, with only hspb <dig> and gfra <dig> still showing a significant change in expression, similar to what was observed in the microarray data.

only at one point in our validation comparisons did we find a discrepancy in the pcr and microarray data, and that was the expression of stat <dig> at 2-weeks post axotomy. this discrepancy could have been due to the fact that the pcr conditions for stat <dig> were not optimal  and/or the expression level of stat <dig> was so low that it was not detected in some of our samples. it is also possible that alternative splicing may have occurred, which could have yielded different results because the array data interrogated the entire mrna, while real time qpcr only amplifies a very small segment .

immunofluorescent validation of the tps neuronal response to injury
our previous work indicates that most tps axons are severely damaged by low thoracic  spinal contusion injury  <cit> . to confirm that the observed changes in gene expression in the transection model are an accurate portrayal of the tps neuronal response to contusion injury, the expression of  <dig> different proteins  were examined immunofluorescently in dtmr retrogradely labeled tps neurons following a moderate spinal contusion injury . comparisons were made at the 1-week post-injury time point in order to minimize confounding results due to lesion site debris-induced autofluorescence apparent at  <dig> days p.i.. immunofluorescent analysis of the response of tps neurons to a t <dig> contusion injury , mirrors the expression pattern revealed by gene array one week post-transection. hspb <dig> immuno-labeling was evident in the majority of dtmr labelled cells 1-week post-contusion . gap <dig> immunoreactivity was only apparent in a small percentage of the dtmr labeled neurons 1-week p.i. , being colocalized in one of the two dtmr labeled tps neurons shown. however, axonal immuno-labeling with gap <dig> was apparent throughout the intermediate gray matter. activated caspase <dig> immuno-labeling  was also found in a proportion of the dtmr labeled tps neurons  at this time-point. there was extensive double labeling of dtmr retrogradely labeled tps neurons 1-week post-contusion with either gfra <dig> or ret . the majority of dtmr labeled tps neurons were also immuno-labeled by gfra <dig> or ret in uninjured control sections indicating that these receptors are normally present in tps neurons. because our tissue sections were not stringently controlled to allow a quantitative analysis, we were unable to determine if the amount of immuno-labeling was increased post-contusion.

no significant change in the expression of the neurotrophic factor receptors ntk <dig> , ntk <dig>  or ntrk <dig>  was seen in the microarray or pcr array analyses. however, these three trk receptors were included in our immuno-labeling analysis because of the key role they play in mediating the effect of neurotrophic factors  on cell survival and axonal growth  <cit> . immuno-labeling for ntrk <dig>  ntrk <dig> , and ntrk <dig>   colocalized  in many dtmr labeled tps neurons . however when the post-axotomy staining was compared to non-injured controls  no noticeable difference in the amount of immuno-labeling within individual tps neurons or the relative number of tps neurons that were immuno-labeled by each neurotrophin receptor antibody was observed .

discussion
microarray technology has been used previously to examine the early genetic response following sci  <cit> . however, most investigations studied the lesion site and/or nearby damaged spinal cord in its entirety and focused mainly on the acute or sub-acute period, ranging from a few hours to several days, and did not follow changes in gene expression over time  <cit> . studies examining genetic changes of long tract neurons post-sci, such as the corticospinal tract, usually have used in situ hybridization. this method is able to resolve genetic changes at a cellular level but is able to analyze only a small number of selected genes  <cit> .

the present study expands on previous studies in several important ways. first, we used lmd to specifically collect individual fg retrogradely prelabeled tps neurons at different times after axotomy. additionally, our use of the affymetrix rat  <dig>  gene st array allowed us to examine the post-injury changes that occurred within the entire rattus norvegicus genome. finally, rather than focusing on the acute injury response during the first  <dig> hours after sci, our analysis began 3-days post injury , and continued until 1-month p.i., a longer period than analyzed in most previous studies.

one potential criticism of using fg to prelabel tps neurons is that fg may have cytotoxic effects on retrogradely labeled neurons over time  <cit> . therefore, we used separate control groups with similar post-fg injection survival times to compare at each interval examined post-sci. little difference was found comparing these control groups with each other in our microarray analysis and no evidence of a pro-apoptotic response was detected, further eliminating this potential variable from confounding our findings.

the microarray gene expression data for  <dig> genes of interest was validated using a combination of qrt-pcr and/or immunohistochemistry . while the spinal transection model was utilized for the microarray expression data to ensure all harvested fg labeled neurons were axotomized, we used a spinal contusion injury model for ihc validation. this second model also axotomizes most tps neurons  <cit> , but results in greater secondary injury processes and continued injury expansion p.i. than spinal transection  <cit> . additionally, spinal contusion injury accounts for most spinal cord injuries in human beings .

one limitation of the present study is that because of the complex experimental design, large numbers of different groups compared, and small numbers of samples per group , the fdr correction we applied to identify genes exhibiting significant main effects of the sci in the hypothesis-free genome-wide analysis is likely to be overly stringent, since many genes clearly showed changes at only one or two of the time points examined. evidence of this was obtained by the qrt-pcr validation, which revealed three additional genes  exhibiting significant changes in gene expression that only achieved nominal significance in the microarray analysis. to circumvent this problem, we specifically designed three gene lists that we hypothesized would be critically involved in the response to injury  determining significance at each time point by performing a 2-factor anova, , with a p value cutoff of  <dig>  based on  <dig> permutations. the hypergeometric analysis of these data indicated a highly significant  <dig>  fold enrichment of rag/csnp genes suggesting an integrated gene network of genes involved in regeneration and neuroprotection. such a network effect was not found for the other two gene lists analyzed, but a small group of upregulated pro-apoptotic genes, and growth factor receptor genes was revealed by this analysis. additionally, we used ipa analysis for evidence of enrichment of significantly changed genes in specific biological pathways/gene networks. to gain a broader view of the genetic response, the data uploaded to ipa consisted of all the genes significantly changed at a p value of  <dig>  or less after fdr correction, and further filtered so only genes expressed in the nervous or immune systems would be analyzed .

tps neurons mount an early but transient regenerative response post-axotomy
one factor previously shown to be important in the cell body response to axotomy is the distance between the location of the axotomy and the neuron's cell body. in this study, the neurons analyzed were collected from the t6-t <dig> spinal segment, two segments rostral  from the lesion site. besides the axotomy being close to the cell body, tps neurons are located near the lesion site with the associated inflammatory and immune responses that occur in this region. both of these factors are likely to play a role in the regenerative response of tps neurons .

our microarray expression data and qrt-pcr experiments confirm that tps neurons mount a robust regenerative response 3-days p.i. genes demonstrating a significant up-regulation following injury at the p <  <dig>  level include a group of genes classically associated with axonal regeneration  including: jun, atf- <dig>  hspb <dig> , adcyap <dig>  gadd45a, gap <dig>  actb, and tubb <dig>  if this level of significance is changed to p <  <dig> , an additional gene associated with axonal regeneration, stmn <dig> , achieves significance. these genes are among those up-regulated within pns neurons during regeneration following a peripheral nerve injury  <cit> , up-regulated within cns neurons after axotomy close to the cell body  <cit> , and up-regulated within cns neurons having axons regenerating into peripheral nerve grafts  <cit> .

however, unlike the pns where these rags remain up-regulated until regenerating axons reach their peripheral target, all of these genes are down-regulated rapidly by 1-week p.i., and approach control levels at longer survival times. this early transient but abortive regenerative response has been reported for particular classes of neurons within the cns  <cit> . an early regenerative response in corticospinal tract  neurons is seen after axotomy near the cell body, but is not seen after spinal axotomy  <cit> . an early regenerative response is also seen within rubrospinal tract  neurons after cervical, but not after thoracic axotomy  <cit> . this difference in the regenerative response is likely the reason rst axons will regenerate within peripheral nerve grafts implanted into the cervical, but not thoracic spinal cord. while there is a large body of supportive evidence that axotomy near the cell body is a key factor in eliciting a regenerative response, there are also exceptions such as purkinje cells  <cit> . 2005). the reasons for this difference are unknown except for the possibility that the recurrent collaterals of purkinje cells are "sustaining", minimizing a cellular reaction  <cit> . the local axotomy that occurs in tps neurons after thoracic sci is a likely reason for the early robust regenerative response found in the present study. this early regenerative response is also likely to be the reason propriospinal axons are better than supraspinal axons in their ability to grow within peripheral nerve or schwann cell grafts implanted within the spinal cord  <cit> . it is presently unknown if factors in these grafts maintain the cellular response, and/or factors within the cns environment inhibit it. schwann cells and vascular macrophages within peripheral nerve grafts secrete a variety of neurotrophic and growth factors as well as extracellular matrix molecules that are both neuroprotective and support continued axonal growth  <cit> . the factors present in the post-injury spinal cord environment that inhibit axonal regrowth have been extensively reviewed  <cit>  and will not be discussed here, but include chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans  and myelin debris, among others.

a recent study conducted by fenrich and rose  <cit>  found that, following a focal midline sagittal surgical injury, local propriospinal commissural  axons regenerate across the lesion site forming specific synaptic connections with contralateral motoneurons. unlike the present study, pci neurons did not appear to undergo apoptosis following this injury . the authors hypothesize that pci axons are able to respond to guidance molecules in a way that allows them to cross the midline and grow through the cspg rich lesion site. the findings from the present study, demonstrating a significant down-regulation in the gene for unc5a, a receptor which mediates the chemorepulsive effect of netrin- <dig> during development  <cit> , could be related to the success of regrowth, as could the down-regulation of both lingo <dig>  <cit>  and ngfrap <dig> <cit> , receptors that mediate inhibitory cues from the post-injury environment. previous studies demonstrate that antagonizing lingo <dig> or unc5a, enhances axonal regeneration in the post-lesion environment  <cit> .

besides the transient up-regulation of rags 3-days post-sci, the largest changes found for most classes of genes occurred during this early period including genes related to the immune and inflammatory response, cell survival, and cell death. again, these changes returned towards pre-axotomy levels at longer survival times. in the sections below we discuss how  the abortive regenerative response of tps neurons may be related to the timing and transient nature of the immune/inflammatory reaction, or to the apparent cell death of most tps neurons.

early inflammatory response
the present investigation did not examine the genetic response of axotomized tps neurons during the first 48-hours post p.i. or the early response to pro-inflammatory cytokines which has been described by others following traumatic spinal injury  <cit> . the genome-wide analysis performed in the present study identified a large number of highly up-regulated genes related to the immune/inflammatory response or cell stress/neuroprotection at the earliest time point, 3-days p.i . the ipa results also showed the three main pathways/networks significantly changed in tps neurons at this time were related to the inflammatory/immune-response, which was not the case at later periods . the inflammatory/immune response genes most highly up-regulated at 3-days p.i. returned towards normal by 1-week post-sci, just as seen for the rags.

it is possible that the early robust immune/inflammatory response we observed in our analysis was caused by immune cell contamination acquired during the laser microdissection. microglial/macrophage contamination cannot be completely excluded since genes expressed by these cells such as itgam , a.k.a, cr <dig> or cd11b http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=itgam, appeared in our analysis. however, a significant number of contaminating immune cells would have resulted in the up-regulation of several other genes/markers for microglia or macrophages  that was not seen. furthering our belief that the mrna collected was from a relatively pure sample of tps neurons was the lack of expression for gfap  and the myelin proteins mag, mog, mbp . thus, our data suggests specificity at a cellular rather than a tissue level, indicating mainly intra-neuronal tps genes have been analyzed.

there is strong evidence that indicates the inflammatory response exacerbates damage at the injury site and contributes to the lack of axonal regeneration, as well as to neuronal apoptosis at the lesion site  <cit> . therefore, inflammation early post-sci may be a contributing factor in potential tps apoptosis . however, other evidence indicates that the inflammatory response and invasion of vascular macrophages  <cit>  may be neuroprotective, as well as stimulating a maximal regenerative response  <cit> , and can foster successful regeneration within pns implants  <cit>  or within the cns, itself  <cit> . for instance, an inflammatory reaction near their cell bodies increases the expression of rags in cst neurons although this response does not contribute to the sprouting or regeneration of cst axons damaged in the spinal cord  <cit> . in this instance, it would be interesting to see if the damaged cst axons would now be able to regenerate within a peripheral nerve implant. similarly, retinal ganglion cell axons grow poorly within pns grafts unless the axons are damaged close to the optic disc, near their cell bodies of origin  <cit> , but regenerate most successfully within peripheral nerve grafts and the optic nerve, itself, with the addition of an inflammatory response resulting from lens injury or other perturbation  <cit> . these studies argue for a component of the inflammatory response playing a major role in the ability of cns neurons to mount a regenerative response, and may be one reason why injury  near the cell body, as in the present case, elicits a regenerative response. recent evidence suggests that the type of macrophage that may be neuroprotective and supports axonal regeneration is found mainly during the first few days following sci, and the type of macrophage detrimental to this process is found chronically after sci  <cit> . whether this difference in the inflammatory response is responsible for the time course of the tps regenerative response remains to be determined.

 <dig>  post-axotomy cell death of axotomized tps neurons?
preliminary results from our laboratory  <cit>  show a large loss in the number of labeled tps neurons by 2-weeks p.i. as assessed by first retrogradely pre-labeling these neurons with fg from the lumbosacral enlargement prior to moderate spinal contusion injury. cell counts 2-weeks p.i. are approximately 70% lower than in uninjured controls. to determine if our retrograde findings were related to cell death, we studied both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes post-sci in the present analysis. we found a significant up-regulation in gene expression for a number of pro-apoptotic genes including casp <dig>  and no significant change in expression for any anti-apoptotic genes indicating that significant apoptosis is likely to occur post-axotomy. ipa analysis also indicated an early up-regulation of a number of genes involved in apoptosis that returned to control level, or were down-regulated at later time points. the question remains as to whether this change in genetic response of tps neurons apparent at the end of the first post-operative week resulted from the inability of tps axons to regenerate in the post-injury spinal environment, or is due to the post-sci cell death of the majority of axotomized tps neurons. it may be that the surviving tps neurons sampled at later survival times are a different population, for instance cells with sustaining collaterals that could limit regeneration and be more resistant to apoptosis.

again, as with the inflammatory response, the maximal response of rags and csnp genes overlapped with the early up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes. others have also reported a parallel increase in a regenerative response post-axotomy, such as an upregulation of gap <dig> and an up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis, usually when axotomy is close to the cell body, and where most axotomized neurons subsequently undergo cell death  <cit> . the post-axotomy apoptosis of neurons in these instances has been prevented or delayed by providing appropriate trophic support  <cit> , by placing the damaged axons in an environment that supports/permits axonal regeneration  <cit> , or by blocking the apoptotic response  <cit> . classes of neuron such as the purkinje cell of the cerebellum normally do not have a regenerative response even with axotomy close to the cell body, and are resistant to post-axotomy cell death  <cit> . however, in transgenic mice where gap <dig> is overexpressed in purkinje cells, even though axonal sprouting occurs, axotomy leads to cell loss unless these neurons are protected by factors in embryonic grafts placed near the severed axons, as reviewed in  <cit> . however, in this and other cases  <cit> , even when apoptosis is prevented, significant axonal regeneration does not take place without additional interventions.

therapeutic implications for tps neurons
the robust regenerative response of tps neurons after thoracic sci is different than that found for most supraspinal neurons . however, the apparent cell death of the majority of tps neurons early after thoracic sci as well as the transient nature of the regenerative response is also different from that found for most supraspinal neurons  where neuronal atrophy results, and cell loss occurs slowly, if at all  <cit> . previous evidence indicates that propriospinal axons have an advantage over supraspinal axons in their ability to regenerate after sci  <cit> . in all of these instances, the affected propriospinal neurons were close to the site of injury, and regenerated into environments conducive to regrowth such as peripheral nerve implants or other type of implant that contained trophic molecules likely to be neuroprotective as well as maintaining the regenerative response. our findings are most similar to the effects of optic nerve damage near the retina, and the consequent early regenerative and cell death response of the majority of retinal ganglion cells . it is possible that treatments enhancing rgc survival and axonal regeneration will also be effective for tps neurons  including the effects of lens injury that increase rgc survival and axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury  <cit> . our result indicates that intervention needs to be rapid, within a few days, prior to apoptosis, just as for rgcs. in addition, presenting tps neurons with specific macrophage related factors may also be beneficial to maintaining axonal regeneration within a cns environment  <cit> .

to determine the neurotrophic or growth factor that would be most effective in protecting tps neurons from apoptosis, and could potentially maintain the initial regenerative response, we analyzed surface receptor and growth factor expression profiles . we found the simultaneous up-regulation of both co-receptor genes for the neurotrophic factor gdnf . iannotti and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that gdnf enhances axonal growth within implants, and, using intrathecal application to the sci lesion site, is neuroprotective for tps neurons and several classes of supraspinal neuron post-sci. in our analysis we also found an upregulation in lifr, a receptor for lif and a co-receptor for cntf. recently, it was demonstrated that lif and cntf are important growth factors caused by lens damage that protect rgcs and stimulate axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury  <cit> . other data also suggest that lif and cntf might be effective neuroprotective agents for tps neurons and maintain axonal regeneration after sci  <cit> . in our analysis we found no significant change in the expression of the trk receptors for the neurotrophins post-axotomy ; bdnf, brain derived neurotrophic factor, ntrk <dig> ; or nt- <dig>  ntrk <dig> ). however, the majority of tps neurons continued to be immunolabeled by appropriate antibodies, suggesting that tps neurons are likely to remain receptive to these neurotrophins post-sci. these neurotrophins have been reported to be highly neuroprotective and/or promote axonal sprouting/regeneration in other classes of neuron  <cit> . our findings suggest that tps neurons should be particularly sensitive to gdnf, lif, and cntf during the first week p.i., and these are the growth factors most likely to be effective in protecting tps neurons from apoptosis and maintaining a regenerative response within a cns environment. there is also evidence these molecules as well as neurotrophins may need to be used in combination acting synergistically on different intracellular targets for a maximal neuroprotective/regenerative response  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have demonstrated the ability of ps axons to grow into peripheral nerve implants and neurotrophin enriched bridges, form functional new neuronal bypass circuits around an incomplete lesion, and cross the midline to form new circuits  <cit> . our microarray, qrt-pcr, and immunofluoresence data show that tps neurons respond to axotomy and low thoracic sci with an early strong inflammatory response and a robust but transient neuroprotective/regenerative response that diminish by the end of the first week p.i., as well as a strong apoptotic response that appears to lead to the loss of the majority of these neurons by 2-weeks p.i.. early changes in tps neurons return to near normal levels of expression in 2-week and 4-week samples, suggesting that the surviving tps neurons sampled at these time points could be a different population, potentially cells with sustaining collaterals that limit the effects of axotomy. up-regulation of receptors to several growth factors suggest reasons why tps neurons survive and regenerate within peripheral nerve implants. these specific growth factors could be applied singly or together in future experiments attempting to protect axotomized ps neurons from apoptosis and maintain the regenerative response after spinal cord injury.
