BACKGROUND
zoraptera  is one of the most enigmatic insect groups. they are wingless or alate small insects, approximately 3 mm in length  <cit> . as a hemimetabolous group, these insects resemble termites in morphological appearance and gregarious behavior. they are found worldwide, but mainly have a limited distribution in tropical and subtropical areas. a total of  <dig> extant species, all of which belong to a single genus zorotypus silvestri, and  <dig> extinct species have been described  <cit>  since the order was first described by silvestri  <cit> . in china, two species have been recorded in tibet and one in taiwan . zoraptera has long been neglected, and only in recent years, morphological, developmental, behavioral, and paleontological knowledge on this species-poor order has been gradually accumulated .

zoraptera is considered to be a member of polyneoptera, a large assemblage of highly diverse insects, including also blattodea, dermaptera, embioptera, grylloblattodea, isoptera, mantodea, mantophasmatodea, orthoptera, phasmatodea, and plecoptera  <cit> . the polyneopteran orders represent one of the earliest-branching lineages of insects, so that an insight into their evolutionary relationships can shed light on the early radiation and diversification of insects. therefore, considerable attention has been attracted to phylogenetic relationships regarding the polyneopteran orders, in particular zoraptera  <cit> .

based on morphological characters and/or nuclear gene sequences , zoraptera have been proposed to be sister to a wide variety of polyneopteran taxa, including dermaptera , embioptera , isoptera  <cit> , dictyoptera , dermaptera + dictyoptera   <cit> , embioptera + phasmatodea  <cit> , and plecoptera + dermaptera  <cit> . in addition, transcriptomic data analysis revealed that zoraptera was sister to the remaining five polyneopteran orders including blattodea, dermaptera, isoptera, orthoptera, and plecoptera  <cit> . a more recent study based on transcriptomic data of eight polyneopteran orders  <cit>  supported that zoraptera either was sister to plecoptera or formed the most deeply diverging lineage in polyneoptera. meanwhile, non-polyneopteran lineages, such as acercaria  <cit> , holometabola  <cit> , and acercaria + holometabola  <cit> , were once pointed out to be sister to zoraptera. however, the hypothesis of its sister-group relationship with the non-polyneopteran lineages was either based on an insufficient evaluation of very incomplete morphological data or an artefact mainly caused by parallel reductions of some of them   <cit> . therefore, the polyneopteran affinities of zoraptera are increasingly being accepted. in spite of these efforts, the exact position of zoraptera within polyneoptera is far from being resolved and its controversial status has been expressed in terms of “zoraptera problem” by beutel and weide  <cit> .

one major reason for the difficulty in resolving the phylogenetic position of zoraptera is ancient rapid radiation of polyneoptera, which diversified almost simultaneously, around  <dig> million year ago  <cit> . this results in limited phylogenetic signal left in extant taxa to trace their relationships. in this case, utilization of multiple independent molecular data could offer an important step towards a fully resolved phylogenetic placement of zoraptera. mitochondrial dna  sequences, in particular the whole mitogenome, are increasingly becoming one of the most commonly used markers in resolving insect relationships from intra-specific to inter-ordinal or even higher levels . insect mitogenome sequences deposited in the genbank database have consequently been increasing rapidly  <cit> , providing an important data source for insect phylogenies. therefore, mitogenomes have the potential to offer new insights into the placement of zoraptera. nevertheless, within polyneoptera and even insecta, zoraptera is the sole order without sequenced complete or nearly complete mitogenomes available in the genbank database.

in the present study, we sequenced and characterized the complete mitogenome of z. medoensis hwang, which was described from motuo county in southeastern tibet of china  <cit> . to determine the position of zoraptera in polyneoptera, mitogenome sequences of z. medoensis and all other polyneopteran orders as well as six outgroup taxa were used for phylogenetic inferences. this represents the first mitochondrial phylogenomic study encompassing all the eleven orders of polyneoptera to date. the present study demonstrates an overall strong resolution of deep-level phylogenies of polyneoptera. furthermore, to analyze the phylogenetic position of zoraptera in a broader context, the taxon sampling was enlarged to the class insecta. however, it is difficult to resolve deep phylogenies of major insect groups with mitogenome datasets.

methods
sample collection and identification
samples of z. medoensis were collected from the type locality of the species in motuo county  in southeastern tibet of china. they were preserved in 100% ethanol and maintained at 4°c until used. besides examination and comparison of their external morphology to that of the types of z. medoensis
 <cit> , molecular evidence was also provided to confirm the identity of the species used in our study. a  <dig> -kb fragment of 18s rdna and a  <dig> -kb fragment of 28s rdna were amplified  and sequenced as below. both sequences were deposited in genbank under accession numbers km <dig> and km <dig>  a blastn search against the nucleotide collection in genbank indicated that the two rdna sequences had the highest identity to those of other zorotypus species, corroborating the identity of z. medoensis we used. these two rdna sequences were not included in our phylogenetic analyses because such sequences of other zoraptera species had been utilized in previous studies .

mitogenome amplification and sequencing
total dna extracted from a single z. medoensis specimen with the dneasy blood & tissue kit  was used as templates for subsequent pcr amplification. five pairs of primers  were designed to amplify overlapping fragments ranging from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb that covered the whole mitogenome. the pcr reactions were performed using la taq™  with the following cycling conditions: 95°c for 1 min; 30 cycles of 98°c for 10 s, 55°c for 10 s, and 68°c for 2–5 min ; 68°c for 10 min. the purified pcr products were sequenced via 3730×l dna analyser . the resulting mtdna sequences were assembled using seqman implemented in the lasergene software .

mitogenome annotation
mitogenome annotation was performed using the mitos web server  <cit> . all trna genes were identified and folded into secondary structures by the mitos, with the exception of trnf, which was identified by the online trnascan-se search server using invertebrate mitochondrial codon predictors  <cit> . for trni, the predicted secondary structures from the two programs were different, i.e. a g-c pair as the tΨc arm in the trnascan-se whereas an unpaired stretch in the mitos. here, we adopted the structure from the trnascan-se, as a single g-c pair was designated as the tΨc arm in trnc and trnl by the mitos. although all the protein-coding genes  and rrna genes were identified by the mitos, most gene boundaries remained unresolved, as was evidenced by either lack of typical start or stop codons or presence of long intergenic spacers. such gene boundaries were determined by alignment of homologous genes in polyneoptera. in cases when a stop codon of pcgs, with the exception of atp <dig> and nad4l, was located in downstream genes encoded by the same strand, an incomplete stop codon  was designated to avoid gene overlaps  <cit> .

bioinformatic analyses
nucleotide composition of z. medoensis mitogenome was calculated using dambe  <cit> . at-skew  and gc-skew  were used to measure nucleotide compositional differences. nucleotide substitution saturation for each of the three codon positions of pcgs was assessed by dambe  <cit> . codon usage and the relative synonymous codon usage  values were calculated using mega <dig>  <cit> . phyltest  <cit> , which allowed the two groups for comparison to contain multiple taxa, was used to conduct relative-rates test between zoraptera and each of all other polyneopteran orders. this test was based on the dna datasets  with kimura 2-parameter and the protein dataset  with poisson correction method.

student’s one-sample t-test was conducted using the spss  <dig>  software  to compare gene/region lengths between zoraptera and all other available polyneopterans with complete mitogenomes. the mitogenome information for this analysis was listed in additional file  <dig>  note that all  <dig> trna genes, due to their short lengths, were concatenated as a single alignment. the a + t-rich region referred to the non-coding sequence between rrns and trni in all polyneopterans, except sinochlora longifissa where this region was translocated downstream of nad2
 <cit> . although two a + t-rich regions were present in ramulus hainanense, only the one adjacent to rrns was used.

phylogenetic analyses
the taxa for phylogenetic analyses of polyneoptera were listed in the additional file  <dig>  only one complete mitogenome had been sequenced for each of four polyneopteran orders including dermaptera, mantodea, mantophasmatodea, and the currently sequenced zoraptera. embioptera and grylloblattodea each had one nearly complete mitogenome available. for the five other orders that had multiple complete or nearly complete mitogenomes sequenced, one representative from each family was selected in the present study to save computational time and to better represent taxonomic diversities. this led to an inclusion of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mitogenomes from plecoptera, blattodea, phasmatodea, isoptera, and orthoptera, respectively. together, the resulting sampling included a total of  <dig> polyneopteran mitogenomes, representing all orders in polyneoptera. to root the phylogenetic tree of polyneoptera,  <dig> outgroup taxa from zygentoma , archaeognatha , ephemeroptera , and odonata  were added in the analysis . this outgroup selection was based on previous phylogenetic relationships  <cit> .

genbank files of all the  <dig> mitogenomes were downloaded from the genbank database and used to extract each of the  <dig> gene and  <dig> protein sequences using the perl scripts  <cit> . the  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> rrna genes, and  <dig> protein sequences were each aligned using the web server of muscle  <cit> . the  <dig> pcg nucleotide sequences were retro-aligned using the corresponding amino acid alignment as implemented in pal2nal  <cit>  with the invertebrate mitochondrial code table. a few trna genes that were not sequenced in incomplete mitogenomes were coded as missing data. poorly aligned positions and divergent regions were deleted by the gblocks server  <cit>  with a more stringent selection, i.e. do not allow many contiguous non-conserved positions. the dna and protein sequences were separately concatenated to obtain final datasets for phylogenetic analyses.

two dna datasets i.e. pcg123rna  and pcg12rna  were built. substitution models and optimal partitioning schemes were selected under the bayesian information criterion  using greedy search algorithms and unlinked branch lengths in partitionfinder  <cit> . the partitions  we pre-defined before running the partitionfinder included individual codon position of each pcg, concatenated trna genes, the rrnl gene, and the rrns gene. among these partitions, the best partitioning strategies and their respective substitution models simultaneously identified by partitionfinder were used in subsequent phylogenetic reconstructions.

bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  analyses were conducted based on each of the two partitioned dna datasets using mrbayes v <dig>   <cit>  and raxml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , respectively. for the bi analysis, two runs of one million generations using  <dig> markov chains were carried out, sampling every  <dig> generations. all model parameters  were unlinked to make sure that each partition had its own set of parameters. “ratepr = variable” was set to allow all partitions to evolve under different rates. the first 25% of the trees were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining were used to generate a 50% majority rule consensus tree with nodal confidence assessed with posterior probabilities . convergence of the chains was assessed by the standard deviation of the split frequencies . for the ml analysis, the gtrgamma model was used and  <dig> ml searches were executed with a random starting tree and a rapid hill-climbing algorithm . the tree topology with the best likelihood score was selected. bootstrap values  were calculated via  <dig> replicates estimated in raxml.

in addition, one protein dataset pcg-aa, i.e. concatenation of  <dig> protein sequences, was also used for phylogenetic analysis as implemented in phylobayes  <dig>   <cit> . the site-heterogeneous mixture model of cat  <cit> , which could account for among-site heterogeneity and lessen the influences of long-branch attraction , was used. two replicates were run and at least  <dig>  samples were drawn from the posterior. the analysis was stopped until the maximum discrepancy in frequencies of bipartitions was below  <dig> , which indicated that the samples had given a good qualitative picture of the posterior consensus  <cit> .

finally, despite the growing body of evidence for the polyneopteran affinities of zoraptera, opposing views have also been proposed . to examine these possibilities, we enlarged the taxon sampling to the class insecta by including protein sequences of holometabola and acercaria . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> species representing holometabola and acercaria, respectively, were added. some orders  exhibiting long branches in previous studies  <cit>  and in our initial analyses  were excluded. the protein dataset  was prepared and used as above mentioned for phylogenetic reconstruction with phylobayes.

likelihood-mapping analysis
to investigate phylogenetic signals contained in each of the datasets , we conducted a likelihood-mapping analysis of  <dig>  random quartets using tree-puzzle  <cit> . a likelihood map consists of an equilateral triangle containing dots representing the likelihoods of the three possible unrooted trees for a set of four sequences  randomly selected from the dataset. the dots near the corners or at the sides respectively represent tree-like  or network-like phylogenetic signals ; the dots at the central area of the map represents star-like signals .

tree topology test
the topology test based on pcg12rna was performed to compare zoraptera + embioptera and other major alternative hypotheses  <cit> , i.e. zoraptera + dictyoptera, zoraptera + dermaptera, zoraptera + plecoptera, and zoraptera + all other polyneopteran orders. the per-site log likelihood scores were calculated for the best-scoring ml trees under each constrained topology using the -f g option in raxml. the outputs were submitted to consel ver.  <dig> i  <cit>  to make a statistical comparison.

RESULTS
characterization of z. medoensismitogenome
the complete mitogenome of z. medoensis  comprised  <dig> pcgs,  <dig> rrna and  <dig> trna genes, and a non-coding a + t-rich region , all of which were arranged in the same order considered ancestral for insects  <cit> . the mitogenome was  <dig>  bp in length, representing the shortest of polyneopteran mitogenomes sequenced so far. nucleotide composition calculation  showed a strong preference for a and t, which accounted for  <dig> % in z. medoensis mitogenome.table  <dig>

the z. medoensis mitogenome possessed gene overlaps and intergenic spacers, with the former more common than the latter . a total of  <dig> overlaps  between genes were present in z. medoensis. a 7-bp overlap of atp8-atp <dig> and a 7-bp overlap of nad4l-nad <dig> existed, which were usually found in other insect mitogenomes  <cit> . except trnt-trnp, all adjoining trna genes, no matter whether they were encoded by the same strand or not, had overlaps. the largest overlap was 12 bp located between trne and trnf. five intergenic spacers, totaling 28 bp, were detected, with the largest one  located between trns and nad <dig> 

eleven of the  <dig> pcgs started with the typical codon atn. however, for cox <dig> and cox <dig>  the putative initiation codon was cga and acg, respectively, both of which were designated in previous studies . in addition to canonical stop codons , incomplete codons  were proposed for the other pcgs immediately followed by a trna gene on the same strand. the  <dig> pcgs consisted of  <dig>  codons, excluding stop codons. auu  and gcg  were the most and least used codons, respectively. the most abundant codon family was ile, followed by leu and met, whereas the least abundant codon family was cys. compared with the first  and second  codon positions, the third codon positions showed an even stronger bias toward a + t  . rscu analysis indicated that all two-fold degenerate codons were a + t biased in the third codon positions. it was also the same case for four-fold degenerate codons except gly and arg, both of which had a preference of a + g to c + t.

z. medoensis mitogenome contained a total of  <dig> trna genes, which ranged from 47 bp  to 69 bp  in size. of them,  <dig> could be folded into typical cloverleaf secondary structures . the lack of dihydrouridine  arm was found in trnc, trnr, and trns, while the absence of tΨc arm occurred in trnh and trnt. the lack of dhu arm in trns is very common in insect mitogenomes  <cit> , whereas the occurrence of truncated secondary structures of other trna genes was limited and was reported e.g. in protura  <cit> .

the rrnl and rrns genes were  <dig>  bp and 724 bp, respectively. the a + t content was  <dig> % for rrnl and  <dig> % for rrns . the 487-bp a + t-rich region, located between rrns and trni, had an a + t content of  <dig> %, lower than the average value of trna genes . tandem repeat units larger than 50 bp, often observed in insect mitogenomes, were not detected within the a + t-rich region of z. medoensis.

comparison of gene/region lengths
to identify sources contributing to the reduced mitogenome size, sequence lengths of major genes/regions between z. medoensis and all other complete polyneopteran mitogenomes were compared and illustrated in figure  <dig>  sizes of the a + t-rich region were most variable, ranging from 69 bp in orthopteran ruspolia dubia to  <dig>  bp in phasmatodean megacrania alpheus adan. the a + t-rich region of z. medoensis was 487 bp, statistically shorter than those of all other polyneopteran mitogenomes sequenced to date . in contrast, all coding genes were overall conserved due to functional constraints; however, all pcgs, rrns, rrnl, and concatenated trna genes were significantly shorter in z. medoensis than other polyneopterans . notably, concatenated trna genes in z. medoensis were  <dig>  bp in size, which were  <dig> % shorter than the average size  of all other polyneopteran counterparts. for rrns and rrnl in z. medoensis, the size reduction was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. conversely, pcg size variations were overall minimal.figure  <dig>

saturation test and nucleotide bias calculation
saturation test of the third codon positions of concatenated pcgs indicated that the index of substitution saturation, iss, was significantly higher than the critical value of the index of saturation, iss.casym . this result suggested that these positions experienced so much saturation that they were useless for phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit> . furthermore, the at- and gc-skew calculation  indicated that inclusion of the third codon positions induced nucleotide compositional bias. specifically, all taxa exhibited negative at- and positive gc-skews for the dataset of pcg12rna; in contrast, for pcg123rna, gc-skew values turned negative for  <dig> species.figure  <dig>

mitogenome-based phylogeny
to unravel the phylogenetic status of zoraptera in polyneoptera, phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on mitogenome datasets  from  <dig> polyneopteran species, representing all the  <dig> orders of polyneoptera, and  <dig> outgroup species. the likelihood-mapping analysis showed that more than  <dig> % of the randomly chosen quartets fell in the corners , thus indicating that each of the three datasets contained sufficient phylogenetic information.

the bi and ml tree topologies inferred from pcg12rna were largely concordant . the monophyletic polyneoptera was recovered . zoraptera, represented by z. medoensis, was sister  to embioptera, represented by aposthonia japonica. zoraptera + embioptera had a close relationship  to verophasmatodea of phasmatodea, and these taxa formed a sister group  with timematodea of phasmatodea, indicating a paraphyly of phasmatodea. plecoptera and dermaptera clustered as a sister group , which split first within polyneoptera. the two suborders  of orthoptera were each strongly recovered as monophyletic, and further constituted a monophyletic orthoptera . blattodea was paraphyletic with two species more close to the monophyletic isoptera . the assemblage of blattodea and isoptera was sister  to mantodea, strongly supporting the monophyly of dictyoptera. the position of mantophasmatodea was not stable, either sister to grylloblattodea with a bpp value of  <dig>  or to zoraptera + embioptera + phasmatodea with a bs value of less than 50%.

the tree topology inferred from the protein dataset  further supported the sister-group relationship  of zoraptera and embioptera . however, both taxa still had long branches. the tree topology was, at the inter-ordinal level, congruent with that based on pcg12rna with the exception that mantophasmatodea was sister  to timematodea of phasmatodea.figure  <dig>

to evaluate phylogenetic performance of the third codon positions, we included them  and reconstructed the phylogeny . the resulting tree strongly supported the sister-group relationship  between zoraptera and embioptera with long branches for both taxa. compared with the results based on pcg12rna, the tree topology inferred from pcg123rna varied mainly for the following orders . polyneoptera was not recovered as monophyletic due to the insertion of ephemeroptera, which was sister  to dermaptera. for orthoptera, the two monophyletic suborders  did not group together, thus rejecting the monophyly of orthoptera. mantophasmatodea was supported as the sister  of grylloblattodea.

to test whether lba affected our phylogenetic inferences, bi analyses using pcg12rna and pcg-aa were each re-conducted after exclusion of embioptera. the resulting trees supported the sister clade of zoraptera and verophasmatodea of phasmatodea . the bpp value was  <dig>  for the dataset pcg12rna and  <dig>  for pcg-aa. in addition, the topology test indicated that zoraptera + embioptera represented the most likely phylogeny and other hypotheses were confidently rejected .table  <dig> 
statistical comparisons among alternative sister-taxa of zoraptera from major hypotheses


statistical tests include the approximately unbiased test , bootstrap probability , bayesian posterior probability , kishino-hasegawa test , shimodaira-hasegawa test , weighted kishino-hasegawa test , and weighted shimodaira-hasegawa test .



the branches of z. medoensis and a. japonica in each analysis were extremely long, possibly suggesting considerably accelerated substitution rates of their mitogenomes. the relative-rates test  confirmed that zoraptera evolved significantly faster than all other polyneopteran orders except embioptera, with either ephemeroptera or odonata set as outgroup for pcg12rna and pcg-aa. for pcg123rna, similar results were obtained with ephemeroptera as outgroup, whereas dermaptera also exhibited a faster substitution rate when odonata was selected as outgroup.

to test the possibilities of sister-group relationships between zoraptera and non-polyneopterans, we enlarged the taxon sampling to the class insecta by adding holometabola and acercaria. overall, the bs values for major nodes were relatively low . the sister-group relationship between long-branched zoraptera and embioptera was supported . the two hemipteran species representing acercaria formed a sister clade. the monophyly of holometabola was recovered , but polyneoptera was not supported as monophyletic.

discussion
mitogenome compactness
z. medoensis mitogenome, although possessing the same gene content as the ancestral insect mitogenome  <cit> , is the shortest polyneopteran mitogenome sequenced to date. on a broad scale, it is only larger than proturan sinentomon erythranum   <cit> , hemipteran neomaskellia andropogonis   <cit> , and dipteran rhopalomyia pomum   <cit>  among all currently available complete mitogenomes of hexapods excluding psocodea , which generally have multiple minicircular mitogenomes  <cit> .

our analyses reveal that both noncoding sequences and coding genes contribute to the size reduction of z. medoensis mitogenome . generally, size variation of insect mitogenomes is attributed to the highly variable-sized noncoding a + t-rich region and/or intergenic spacers  <cit> . for z. medoensis, the small a + t-rich region , which is shorter than half of the average size  of other polyneopteran mitogenomes, and the short intergenic spacers , account in part for the compactness. on the other hand, all the coding genes of z. medoensis also have a size reduction. particularly, concatenated trna genes display a size reduction of  <dig> %. for some trna genes, the size reduction is reflected by loss of tΨc or dhu arms . these results are consistent with the proposed association between mitogenome size reduction and gene length shortening  <cit> . from an evolutionary perspective, smaller mitogenome sizes are selectively favored due to a replication advantage and a slower rate of slightly deleterious mutation accumulation  <cit> .

accelerated substitution rate
the relative-rates test reveals that z. medoensis mitogenome has a significantly accelerated substitution rate relative to all other polyneopteran orders except embioptera as well as dermaptera in one case . the extremely long branch of z. medoensis in each phylogenetic tree provides additional evidence for its fast substitution rate. accelerated rates of arthropod mitogenomes have been suggested to be caused by three main factors, i.e. mitogenome rearrangements, parasitic lifestyle, and small body size  <cit> . in addition, metabolic rate, generation time, and environmental temperature are also correlated with substitution rate variations  <cit> . these factors are not independent to one another; for example, body size and temperature could affect metabolic rate  <cit>  and generation time  <cit> . for embioptera, the fast-evolving mitogenome of a. japonica was primarily attributed to frequent gene rearrangement  <cit> . for z. medoensis, a non-parasitic insect, there is no rearrangement in the mitogenome. among all the factors listed above, the small body size of z. medoensis, less than 4 mm  <cit> , and/or warm environments they are living in may explain the fast substitution rate. however, thomas et al.  <cit>  found no evidence of body size influence on invertebrate substitution rates. we should note that their study included, for insects, only two holometabolous orders  and three mitochondrial genes , so the body size effect for polyneoptera cannot be ruled out. it is possible that other as yet undiscovered factors also contribute to the fast substitution rate of z. medoensis mitogenome.

phylogeny
in our current taxon sampling, the third codon positions of pcgs are severely saturated and cause biased nucleotide composition . the inclusion of the third codon positions for the phylogenetic reconstruction results in the polyphyly of orthoptera and the placement of one outgroup order  within polyneoptera , contradicting with widely accepted hypotheses  <cit> . such saturation and compositional heterogeneity are particularly misleading in phylogenetic inferences  <cit>  and third codon positions have been suggested to be excluded from analyses of deep-level phylogenies  <cit> . our results strengthen the idea that the third codon positions with saturation and compositional heterogeneity should be excluded from mtdna-based phylogenies of polyneoptera. therefore, the datasets of pcg12rna and pcg-aa could better reflect the true evolutionary history.

zoraptera, whose mitogenome data have never been included before, is consistently recovered as sister to embioptera in all our phylogenetic analyses, supporting the clade of mystroptera   <cit> . their close affinities were further corroborated by the topology test . the clade of zoraptera + embioptera was first proposed by minet and bourgoin  <cit>  and was further supported by recent morphological studies . our study provides, for the first time, molecular evidence for their sister-group relationship.

in earlier phylogenetic studies involving zoraptera, very limited molecular markers were frequently used, including only 18s and 28s rdna, histone  <dig> dna sequence, and three nuclear-encoded protein sequences . the resolving power of phylogenetic analyses based on a small number of genes is generally weak due to a restricted amount of phylogenetic information in individual genes. the situation is even worse for polyneoptera, which has experienced ancient rapid radiation  <cit> . in addition, some analytical methods in previous studies were pointed out to be problematic  <cit> . these factors resulted in generally low nodal supports, leaving the position of zoraptera unstable and controversial. recent high-throughput sequencing techniques promote accumulation of transcriptomic data and such data have begun to be applied in polyneoptera  <cit> . although the large datasets demonstrated an overall strong resolving power, the position of zoraptera was inconsistent and generally weakly supported  <cit> . therefore, in the context of poor sampling with one representative for most of the eight polyneopteran orders available, current transcriptomic data cannot conclusively address the position of zoraptera. here, based on mitogenome datasets, we provide further evidence for the placement of zoraptera as sister to embioptera, although a dense sampling has yet to be achieved to solidify the grouping. it should be noted that, when the taxon sampling was enlarged to insecta, the resulting tree shows an overall poor statistical supports for major deep nodes , possibly due to the limits of mitogenome datasets in resolving deep phylogeny of insecta  <cit> . taken together, mitogenome data demonstrate an overall strong resolution of deep-level phylogenies of polyneoptera but not insecta.

in our study both zoraptera and embioptera exhibit rather long branches  due to accelerated substitution rates . such long branches may be grouped together due to lba artefacts rather than true relatives. lba refers to erroneous clustering of long branches as sister groups caused by methodological artefacts  <cit> . to avoid lba effects, many strategies have been proposed  <cit> , such as omitting faster evolving characters , removing long-branch taxa, enlarging taxon sampling to break up long branches, and adopting the cat model. in our study, either excluding third codon positions or using more conserved protein sequences with the cat model still generates long branches for both zoraptera and embioptera . after removing embioptera, the position of zoraptera remains unchanged . therefore, the lba effect on the phylogenetic position of zoraptera appears not so obvious, but at present it cannot be ruled out. similarly, a mitogenome-based phylogenetic study of polyneoptera without zoraptera and dermaptera also demonstrated a long-branch embioptera, but no lba effect was detected  <cit> . to break up long branches, it is crucial to expand taxon sampling of both zoraptera and embioptera. furthermore, for dermaptera, mantodea, mantophasmatodea, grylloblattodea, and timematodea of phasmatodea, which are each poorly represented by only a single species with mitogenome information available, intensive taxon sampling is also highly desirable. with increased taxon sampling densities, selection and usage of mitogenomes from those taxa without showing long branches can greatly improve phylogenetic accuracy of polyneoptera.

CONCLUSIONS
the mitogenome of z. medoensis, the first representative of zoraptera, shows a number of very unusual features, including compactness, trna truncation, and fast substitution rate. phylogenetic analyses strongly support the sister-group relationship of zoraptera and embioptera, offering molecular evidence for the first time to corroborate previous morphological results. characterization of z. medoensis mitogenome adds on our knowledge not only of the enigmatic zoraptera but also of early diversification of insects. to improve phylogenetic accuracy, mitogenome sequencing of extensive taxon sampling of zoraptera and embioptera as well as other currently sparsely represented orders  is preferable.

 additional file 5:
likelihood map of pcg12rna , pcg123rna , and pcg-aa . the numbers indicate the percentage of dots. 

 additional file 6:
bayesian phylogram of polyneoptera based on pcg123rna. the numbers at the nodes refer to bpp and bs values. nodal support values of  <dig>  for bpp or 100% for bs are represented by “*”; bs values below 50% are represented by “ < ”. the solid red branches are not supported by the ml method; their positions under the ml method are indicated by dashed red branches with bs values shown around. the dashed red branches are not scaled to their lengths.
