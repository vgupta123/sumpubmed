BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms are changes in a cellâ€™s biochemistry, physiology or behavior that occur with a roughly 24-hour period. the rhythms are the observable outputs of a cell-autonomous and resettable timekeeper  <cit>  called a circadian clock. this endogenous circadian clock is ubiquitous and organized as transcription-translation feedback loops  in eukaryotes, and although the genes that constitute the clock differ between plant, animal and fungal model systems  <cit> , transcriptional control is thought to be an integral component of the clock mechanism. even in cyanobacteria, where a daily rhythm in the phosphorylation state of the clock protein kaic has been proposed to be the pacemaker  <cit> , a kaic ttfl may be required for generating robust rhythms  <cit> .

recent observations, however, have indicated that transcription is not always required to produce circadian oscillations, as evidenced by the daily oscillation of redox cycles of peroxiredoxin in red blood cells  <cit>  and the green algae ostreococcus tauri  <cit> . interestingly, when o. tauri is placed in prolonged darkness, transcription rates fall below detectable limits and the rhythm in luciferase fused with the clock component cca  dampens after one day. however, when rhythmicity is re-initiated by transfer to constant light, the phase of the rhythm varies depending on the time when cells are exposed to light  <cit> . thus, either a timer driving the observed rhythm of this translational reporter continues even though the overt rhythm itself is undetectable, or the ttfl of o. tauri may be influenced by cross-talk with the non-transcriptional peroxiredoxin rhythm which has been shown to continue unabated in darkness.

the marine dinoflagellate lingulodinium displays a large variety of overt rhythms and has been a model for study of the mechanisms linking the clock with these rhythms for many years  <cit> . for example, the bioluminescence rhythm is correlated with rhythmic changes in the amount of the reaction catalyst   <cit>  and of a luciferin binding protein   <cit>  that protects the bioluminescence substrate luciferin from non-bioluminescent oxidation. in addition, the sequestration of the key carbon-fixing enzyme ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  within the pyrenoid of the chloroplast is correlated with the capacity of the cell to fix carbon efficiently  <cit> . both these different rhythms correlate with rhythms in the rate of protein synthesis in vivo, indicating that clock control over gene expression may regulate the timing of the rhythms. importantly, in these and other examples, the control over protein synthesis occurs at a translational level since levels of the corresponding mrnas do not change over the daily cycle  <cit> .

in contrast to the depth of knowledge concerning the rhythms, the mechanism of the circadian clock in lingulodinium remains unknown. to compound the difficulty in characterizing the central timer, physiological studies have shown that these single-celled organisms actually contain two different endogenous clocks, as the rhythms of bioluminescence and swimming behavior can run with different periods  <cit>  and show different phase resetting behavior  <cit> . in the present study, we looked for rhythmic transcripts in lingulodinium in order to identify potential ttfl components. we used rna-seq to assess levels of all rna species in a lingulodiunium transcriptome  <cit>  over both diurnal and circadian cycles. surprisingly, our analyses indicate that lingulodinium does not express any detectable rhythmic transcripts. this suggests that the mechanism of the endogenous timers in this organism will instead involve translational and post-translational mechanisms.

RESULTS
to assess the possibility of isolating components of a transcription-based oscillator in a dinoflagellate, rna-seq was used to quantitate transcript levels globally at different times. two different rna-seq experiments were performed, the first of which generated  <dig> million  <dig> bp paired end reads  while the second generated  <dig> million  <dig> bp paired end reads , of which 51% and 92%, respectively, mapped to our de novo gene assemblies. we first compared zt  <dig> and zt  <dig> by mapping the  <dig> bp reads to a  <dig>  contig trinity assembly  <cit>  , expecting to find both light-induced and circadian differences between the two times. instead, read counts from the two times, normalized as reads per kilobase per million reads   <cit>  show surprisingly few differences in mrna levels. deseq  <cit>  analysis indicated that only five contigs showed significantly different levels between the two times . a similar result was obtained when the reads were mapped to a  <dig>  contig velvet assembly  <cit>  for which deseq identified  <dig> significant differences  . of the five significant differences uncovered using the trinity assembly, three were also identified as significant using the velvet assembly, while the remaining two do not have corresponding contigs in the velvet assembly. the increased number of significant differences in the velvet assembly is primarily due to slight differences in the read counts that move either the fold difference or the mean read counts above the significance threshold. similar results were obtained using edger  <cit>  to assess significant differences, so deseq was used for all further analyses.figure  <dig>

to confirm the similarity in transcript levels between midday and midnight, the midday/midnight comparison was repeated using the  <dig> bp paired-end read experiment. this experiment included samples taken at both true  and at subjective  midnight, so we first assessed the similarity between these two. deseq analysis identified nine and six significant differences when read counts were mapped to the trinity  and velvet  assemblies, respectively, with only one contig common to both. we conclude from this that constant light during the night phase does not cause a major alteration in gene expression, and, thus, the two midnight samples are essentially duplicates. we, therefore, compared the duplicate midday samples with these two midnight samples using deseq . this analysis revealed no significant differences using the trinity assembly and only three significant differences with the velvet assembly. since none of the differences found in this second experiment were in common with those found in the first experiment, we conclude that the mrna complement of the cells at midday is the same as at midnight.

to test the possibility that cells might express rhythmic rna with maxima lying between midday and midnight, we next compared the two additional times  in the  <dig> bp read experiment. these times, immediately after the light/dark transitions, were chosen to maximize the chances of finding differentially accumulated rnas. we determined significant differences from all possible pairwise comparisons of read counts mapped to the trinity assembly using deseq  and combined all to yield a final list of  <dig> non-rrna sequences . those showing the greatest fold-differences were typically lower in abundance . hierarchical clustering identified four main groups of sequences, with those peaking at zt  <dig> containing the greatest number of significantly different rnas . surprisingly, however, among the  <dig> sequences that could be identified by sequence homology were found two of the three known mitochondrial protein-coding genes  <cit>  and nine of the ten known plastid protein-coding genes  <cit> , and all these organelle-encoded transcripts were among the group with peak expression at zt  <dig>  the plastid-encoded sequences included the psba transcript that had been previously shown by northern analyses to be arrhythmic  <cit> , suggesting that at least some of the transcripts identified as significantly different in our high throughput approach might in fact be false positives. to assess this possibility, northern analyses were performed using a random selection of  <dig> sequences . no rhythmicity was observed in the levels of any of these rnas, as confirmed by densitometric scans . taken together, the two rna-seq experiments thus indicate that the entire mrna complement of the cell is maintained at constant levels over the 24-hour cycle, both under light/dark cycles or in constant light.figure  <dig>

the absence of rhythmic rnas suggested that the circadian clock would continue unabated in the presence of transcription inhibitors. to test this, we exposed cell cultures to a combination of the transcription inhibitors actinomycin d and cordycepin . actinomycin d binds to dna and interferes with transcription and replication  <cit>  while cordycepin interferes with polyadenylation of mrnas  <cit> . this combined treatment reduced rna synthesis to levels roughly 5% of vehicle-treated cultures  and is lethal after three days. importantly, within this three-day time frame, the presence of the inhibitors does not change the timing of the bioluminescence rhythm in constant darkness  although the amplitude of the rhythm shows a marked decrease. furthermore, the timing of the photosynthesis rhythm in constant light  appears similar in the presence of the drug, although again we note a marked decrease in the rhythmic amplitude, especially during the third day . we conclude from these experiments that, despite a strong effect on the amplitude of the two rhythms, robust transcription is not required for determining their circadian timing.figure  <dig> 
rhythms continue in the presence of transcription inhibitors.  a combination of actinomycin d and cordycepin reduces rna synthesis rates to around 5%  of the values of vehicle treated cultures. cultures survive three to five days at these concentrations of inhibitors.  there is no change in the timing of the bioluminescence rhythm in constant dark. horizontal bars indicate the light regime, with drugs added to the cultures at the indicated times . each data point is the average of three samples.  there is no change in the timing of the ph rhythm used to monitor co <dig> fixation. a representative example of three different experiments is shown for each treatment. the amplitude of the rhythm is severely diminished by the third day of treatment with inhibitors. sd, standard deviation.



discussion
the results described here indicate that none of the sequences in our lingulodinium transcriptomes show circadian or diurnal variations in transcript levels . these analyses rely on assemblies, derived from high throughput illumina rna-seq experiments that have been constructed using either velvet or trinity. the velvet assembly has been most extensively characterized, with the  <dig>  contigs estimated to represent approximately 94% of the total transcripts expressed by the cells  <cit> . the  <dig>  contig trinity transcriptome contains all the velvet contigs as well as roughly  <dig>  additional contigs  <cit> . thus, it seems unlikely that lingulodinium will express a rhythmic transcript in an rna species that is not represented in either of the two assemblies. this conclusion is also supported by the finding that reducing the transcription rate to 5% of control levels does not affect the period of either the bioluminescence or the photosynthesis rhythms .

the manifestation of eukaryotic circadian rhythms in the absence of transcription was first suggested by observations of the photosynthesis rhythm in enucleated acetabularia  <cit> . more recently, the finding of a circadian rhythm in peroxiredoxin redox state in red blood cells  <cit> , the demonstration of a frq-less oscillator in neurospora  <cit>  and the ability of transcription-incompetent o. tauri  <cit>  to keep time in constant darkness have also provided support for this view. however, since these latter two organisms also have a canonical ttfl, the significance of a non-transcriptional oscillator operating in parallel remains unclear. in contrast, our findings indicate that the entire lingulodinium circadian system has evolved to function without a ttfl, a particularly remarkable finding considering that there are at least two independent circadian timers in these cells  <cit> . it is unknown at this time if lingulodinium will also show a circadian rhythm in peroxiredoxin redox state.

one possible explanation for the absence of transcriptional control in the lingulodinium clock is the potential difficulty in regulating transcription in the dinoflagellates. indeed, these organisms do not contain detectable levels of histone proteins  <cit> , their chromosomes are permanently condensed  <cit> , and the number and diversity of transcription factors is also much reduced compared to other eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, a global analysis of mrnas in the dinoflagellate karenia has shown their half-lives to be substantially longer than reported in other organisms  <cit> , as might be expected if little control was exerted at the level of rna synthesis rates. lingulodinium also appears to have quite stable rnas, as least for the few specific cases that have been examined  <cit> .

how might timing signals be generated in lingulodinium in the absence of rhythmic transcripts? previous work with the system has shown that inhibitors of translation  have major phase-shifting effects on the bioluminescence rhythm  <cit> . in particular, a specific dose of the inhibitor anisomycin given at a specific time, but not lower or higher doses, can induce arrhythmicity  <cit> . this has been interpreted by a limit cycle model to mean that the clock has been driven to a singularity and provides strong presumptive evidence that translation is a state variable in the clock mechanism. in addition to inhibitors of translation, the kinase inhibitors staurosporine and 6-dimethyl amino purine  affect the period of the bioluminescence rhythm when administered chronically and strongly affect light-induced phase shifts  <cit> . similarly, a range of protein phosphatase inhibitors  also affect the rhythmic period when given chronically, although they appear unable to block light-induced phase shifts  <cit> . we suggest that, in the absence of rhythmic transcripts, lingulodinium may have evolved translational/posttranslational feedback loops with 24-hour rhythmicity that can act as the central timing mechanism. one intriguing possibility is that protein phosphorylation may be used to control translation, as lingulodinium has casein kinase  <dig>  sites in a large number of rna binding proteins  <cit> . ck <dig> is a kinase that has been implicated in animal, plant and fungal clock mechanisms  <cit> .

there is growing awareness that rna-binding proteins may play an important role in clock function. for example, the chlamydomonas protein chlamy <dig> is involved in controlling both the period and phase of the circadian rhythms  <cit> . in addition, a cold-induced rna-binding protein appears to be required for efficient translation of the clock gene clock transcripts in mammalian cells  <cit> . lastly, atx  in drosophila is an rna-associated protein that, together with tyf , is required for translating the transcripts from the clock gene period   <cit> . tyf binds both to the poly-binding protein , a factor binding the polyadenylated tail at the 3â€™ end of mrna, and to the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif4e, which binds the cap at the 5â€™ end of the mrna  <cit> . this circularization is thought to increase translation  <cit>  which in this case would be targeted to the per transcript. in mouse liver cells, changes in the length of the poly tail occur independently from the steady state level of the transcripts, and tail length is associated with circadian control over protein synthesis  <cit> .

the lack of rhythmic transcripts over the daily cycle in lingulodinium provides new impetus for an examination of translation and post-translational mechanisms in the clock. the former may be addressed by methods such as translating ribosome affinity purification, which has been used to demonstrate rhythmic translation from constant levels of mrna in drosophila  <cit> . the latter, at least for modifications involving phosphorylation, is now becoming accessible through phosphoprotein purification and tandem mass spectrometry  de novo sequencing  <cit> . in any event, it is clear that the long-studied lingulodinium circadian system has still some surprises in reserve.

CONCLUSIONS
the lack of oscillating rnas over the circadian cycle of the dinoflagellate lingulodinium indicates that the clock mechanism in this organism does not use or require rhythmic changes in rna amounts.
