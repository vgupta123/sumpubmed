BACKGROUND
although once widely assumed that the only source for extracellular atp was from damaged cells under pathophysiological conditions, it is now accepted that atp is also released under normal physiological conditions in several organ systems via exocytosis  <cit> , efflux through connexon or pannexin “hemichannels”  <cit> , voltage-dependent anion channels  <cit> , and/or activated p2x <dig> receptors  <cit> . extracellular atp has numerous functions in sensory systems. it is released via pannexins to mediate intercellular communication in taste buds  <cit> . in the auditory system, spontaneous atp release is required for activity in the developing auditory system  <cit> , atp release through connexin hemichannels propagates calcium signals in the inner ear  <cit>  and purinergic receptor activation by atp is essential in the cell-cell communication that accompanies cochlear injury  <cit> . in retinal glial cells, atp release propagates spontaneous intercellular glial calcium waves that alter the diameter of arterioles in the retina, suggesting released atp can affect retinal physiology  <cit> .

atp also mediates essential functions in the olfactory system:  atp activation of purinergic receptors in swiss webster mouse olfactory epithelium  induces neuroproliferation  <cit>   atp has proliferative and protective effects following injury  <cit>  and  atp induces upregulation and/or release of various neurotrophic factors  <cit> . given the multiple roles of atp in the mouse oe, we hypothesized that atp was released under both normal and pathophysiological conditions in mouse oe and likely involved multiple mechanisms. vesicles containing atp could be released via calcium-dependent exocytosis. cytosolic atp could also be released by efflux via atp binding cassette  transporters  <cit>  expressed in the oe  <cit> . several connexin subtypes are expressed in the oe  <cit>  and pannexins are expressed in the olfactory bulb  <cit> , but as of yet, no reports have examined pannexin expression in the epithelium. p2x <dig> receptors have been identified in the oe using immunohistochemistry  <cit> . thus, there are multiple pathways of atp release possible in the oe. determination of atp release mechanisms is of paramount importance to improve our understanding of the oe regenerative properties.

the aim of this study was first to investigate whether atp release mechanisms were present in mouse oe, using swiss webster neonatal oe slices as a model. using  <dig> techniques, we showed that atp is released in neonatal oe through constitutive and evoked release. we then characterized the mechanisms underlying the two types of atp release using the luciferin-luciferase assay and the fluorescent atp marker quinacrine to monitor the loss of atp fluorescence from endogenous vesicular stores. our results show that the evoked release of atp is mediated by purinergic receptor activation and can occur via calcium-dependent exocytosis, efflux of atp through activated p2x <dig> receptors or activated p2x <dig> receptor/pannexin complexes, and abc transporters. confocal calcium imaging of p2x2-transfected hek <dig> cells used as biosensors further confirmed the presence of the evoked release of atp. the constitutive release of atp does not require purinergic receptor activation, but is mediated by continuous exocytosis and efflux through hemichannels or abc transporters. in vivo studies indicate that constitutive vesicular release may play a role in neuronal homeostasis as inhibition of exocytosis inhibited the normal proliferation in the oe. overall, determination of the atp release mechanisms in the oe has identified numerous pharmacological targets to pursue that could modulate neuronal homeostasis.

RESULTS
functional purinergic receptors are present in the neonatal olfactory epithelium
previous reports using immunohistochemistry indicated that p2x <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and p2y <dig>  receptors are located in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> , while p2x <dig> receptors were not located in the oe  <cit> . using calcium imaging, we previously showed functional expression of p2y <dig>  and p2x <dig>  receptors  <cit> , but had not examined for the presence of functional p2x <dig> , <dig> receptors. to determine the most effective agonists to activate purinergic receptors in our neonatal oe slices preparation, we performed calcium imaging using the selective p2y <dig> , <dig> agonist utp , p2x <dig> agonist cytidine 5’-triphosphate , p2x <dig> / <dig>  agonist α,β-methylene atp  and p2x <dig>  agonist 2'-o-atp  . for utp, ctp and bz-atp, we recorded from  <dig> cells located in the apical oe, presumably from sustentacular cell somas. of the  <dig> atp-responsive cells, 99%  responded to utp, 79%  to bz-atp, and 36%  to ctp. the following agonist profile was observed: atp = utp > bz-atp = ctp . the p2x <dig>  2/ <dig>  agonist αβmeatp did not elicit a calcium transient in any of the  <dig> cells examined. this result suggests that p2x <dig>  receptors are not readily activated in our imaging experiments and, as such, the bz-atp-evoked responses were mediated via p2x <dig> as opposed to p2x <dig> receptors. punctate p2x <dig> receptor immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the middle and apical layers of the oe , corroborating the bz-atp-induced calcium transients. in our previous study  <cit>  calcium responses were recorded from 14% of the cells following application to p2y <dig> , <dig> agonist adp, 9% of all cells following application of p2x <dig> agonist β,γ-methylene-atp, 2% of all cells following application of p2y <dig> , <dig> agonist 2-methylthioadenosine-5'-o-diphosphate, and no cells following application of amp or adenosine, both atp degradation products and adenosine receptor agonists. collectively, these data using selective agonists suggest the presence of p2y <dig> , <dig> and p2x <dig> , <dig>  receptors that elicit increases in intracellular calcium that could induce the subsequent release of atp.

constitutive and atp-evoked atp release occurs in the mouse olfactory epithelium
we assessed whether atp is released in the olfactory epithelium under control physiological conditions and following atp application. endogenous atp stores in neonatal oe slices were labeled with the fluorescent compound quinacrine as previously performed  <cit> . quinacrine-labeled atp stores appear as puncta of fluorescence located throughout the oe . the individual punctum ranged in diameter between  <dig> and 250 nm, and sometimes multiple puncta appeared as clusters ranging up to  <dig>  μm in diameter, suggesting that quinacrine labels atp that is stored in large vesicles. we visualized the release of atp from the fluorescent puncta over a period of  <dig> seconds under physiological conditions  and observed either a linear or an exponential decrease in fluorescence intensity . atp fluorescence in a region of a quinacrine-labeled slice that was devoid of punctate fluorescence  showed a minimal change in fluorescence over time, suggesting that the decrease in fluorescence of the puncta is not photobleaching of quinacrine, but rather due to atp release. application of 50 μm atp changed the properties of the fluorescent puncta. while some puncta showed an exponential decrease of their fluorescence , fluorescence from other puncta either dynamically fluctuated  or exhibited decreasing fluorescence intensity while the puncta became mobile . we quantified both the rate of atp release and the amount of released atp from all puncta recorded following application of physiological ringer’s solution  or 50 μm atp. the rate of atp release was significantly faster following atp application compared to control . in addition, exogenous atp  significantly increased the amount of released atp compared to vehicle control . these data indicate that both constitutive  and evoked  release of atp occurs in the mouse olfactory epithelium.

*, data is presented as mean ± sem. #, p <  <dig>  student’s t-test.

to confirm that the decrease in fluorescence from the puncta is due to release of quinacrine-labeled atp rather than moving out of the focal plane, we assessed both constitutive and evoked release of atp after 400 s using confocal z stack recordings . atp evoked a significant increase in atp release compared to control . the amount of atp released from quinacrine-labeled atp stores under control or atp-evoked conditions was statistically similar using both the z stack and the time series recording method . these data support the use of z stack recording to measure both constitutive and atp-evoked release of atp. as this method is devoid of putative artifacts related to a shift of focus over time, we used z stack recordings in all subsequent recordings using quinacrine.

atp release is mediated via purinergic receptor activation
we monitored quinacrine-labeled endogenous atp stores following application of purinergic receptor agonists . specific p2y <dig> , <dig> agonist utp , p2x <dig> / <dig>  agonist αβmeatp , and p2x <dig>  agonist bz-atp  significantly increased the amount of released atp compared to control . the p2y <dig> , <dig> agonist utp released significantly less atp than atp and the selective p2x agonists, αβmeatp and bz-atp . these data suggest that atp evokes the release of atp through stimulation of multiple purinergic receptor subunits.

to confirm that atp-evoked atp release is linked to stimulation of purinergic receptors, we pre-treated oe slices with either the ectonucleotidase apyrase to degrade extracellular atp or the non-selective purinergic receptor antagonist ppads. ppads pre-treatment  did not have an effect on the constitutive release of atp . however, ppads pre-treatment significantly inhibited the atp-evoked release of atp back to control . incubation with apyrase  significantly impaired the constitutive release of atp compared to control conditions . in addition, apyrase pre-treatment  significantly impaired atp-evoked release of atp to levels that were significantly lower than control . taken together, our data indicate that atp evokes release of atp following purinergic receptor activation.

we next used the luciferin-luciferase assay to quantify the amount of atp release from neonatal oe slices. under physiological conditions 19 ± 4 nm atp was released from oe tissue slices . although there was a 3-fold decrease in the amount of atp released in the presence of non-specific purinergic receptor inhibitor ppads , it was not significantly different from control . these data are in agreement with the quinacrine-generated data and suggest that constitutive release is not mediated by purinergic receptors. application of atp, a co-factor for luciferase, would interfere with the ability to measure endogenously released atp using the luciferin-luciferase assay. however, the p2x <dig>  receptor agonist bz-atp  induced a low level of bioluminescence corresponding to 576 ± 424 nm atp , n =  <dig> slices), allowing the quantification of evoked atp-release. bz-atp  evoked a significant 5-fold increase in bioluminescence in the presence of oe tissue slices : 3108 ± 914 nm atp, n =  <dig> slices, p <  <dig>  v. no tissue, one-way anova with planned comparisons). significantly more atp was released from slices stimulated with 50 μm bz-atp than from control conditions . the non-specific purinergic receptor inhibitor ppads  significantly inhibited the bz-atp-evoked release of atp to control  levels . these data confirm the involvement of p2x <dig>  receptors in the evoked release of atp.

we next used stable p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells as biosensors to further confirm that atp is released from oe slices. fluo-4 am loaded p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells were stimulated with atp concentrations ranging from 20 nm, the concentration of atp constitutively released from oe slices as measured by the luciferin-luciferase assay, to 5 μm, the concentration released from oe slices by bz-atp stimulation. atp application  was insufficient to elicit an increase in intracellular calcium  and 50 nm atp induced a very small calcium response in fluo-4 am loaded p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells . the mean peak  atp response elicited by 5 μm  was significantly higher than the mean peak amplitudes elicited by all lower atp concentrations . pretreatment with ppads  totally abolished the atp-induced calcium transients in the p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells , indicating the calcium increase was mediated by activated p2x <dig> receptors. neither control ringer’s solution nor bz-atp  induced increases in intracellular calcium in the p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells . these data suggest that p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells are not sensitive enough to detect constitutively released atp . indeed, no calcium increases were detected in p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells located adjacent to an oe slice in the recording chamber . however, the p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells are sensitive enough to detect the evoked release of atp from oe slices which is ~3 μm . in the presence of an oe slice, 50 μm bz-atp induced a mean  calcium transient peak amplitude of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Δf/f in the p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells . as bz-atp did not elicit calcium increases in p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells in the absence of oe tissue, these data indicate that bz-atp evokes the release of atp from oe slices. note that the calcium response elicited by bz-atp stimulation of an oe slice was similar to that elicited by 5 μm atp in the absence of an oe slice . this result suggests that approximately 5 μm atp is released from a slice following stimulation with bz-atp and is consistent with the data obtained by the luciferin-luciferase assays. taken together, data obtained from fluo-4 am loaded p2x2-transfected hek- <dig> cells show that atp is released from oe slices following p2x <dig>  purinergic receptor stimulation.

mechanisms of atp-evoked atp release
we tested the hypothesis that atp-evoked atp release in the olfactory epithelium is similar to that in other organ systems and investigated the roles of purinergic receptors, vesicular exocytosis, pannexin/connexin hemi channels and abc transporters . quinacrine imaging was used to investigate vesicular exocytosis as this technique allows visualization of vesicular atp release, and luminometry assays were used to quantify atp release for all the proposed mechanisms. our data support the hypothesis that atp-evoked release of atp is mediated predominantly by ionotropic p2x <dig> , <dig> receptors , but there is evidence that g-protein coupled p2y <dig> , <dig> receptors may also be involved . activation of either receptor subtype increases intracellular calcium which could induce calcium-dependent exocytosis. removal of extracellular calcium significantly inhibited atp-evoked release of atp . these data further support the involvement of ionotropic p2x <dig> , <dig> receptors, but does not rule out the possibility of a p2y <dig> , <dig> receptor contribution. we hypothesized that increases in intracellular calcium following purinergic receptor activation may lead to calcium-dependent exocytosis of atp stored in vesicles. pre-treatment with clostridium difficile toxin a , known to impair the fusion of vesicles and potently inhibit exocytosis, significantly impaired the evoked release of atp . in addition, n-ethylmaleimide, another vesicle fusion inhibitor, significantly inhibited the atp-evoked release of atp . exocytosis requires formation of soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor  core complexes  <cit> . we examined the expression of the snare complex protein synaptosomal associated protein - <dig>  snap- <dig> localized to the thin cytoplasmic extensions throughout the oe that could be either sustentacular cells or neurons . taken together, our data indicate that purinergic receptor-mediated calcium-dependent exocytosis evokes the release of atp.

atp can also be released through a large non-selective pore formed either by the p2x <dig> receptor  <cit>  or by the p2x <dig> receptor in a complex with pannexin  <cit> . to test if atp or bz-atp evokes the release of atp via a p2x7-pannexin complex, we used carbenoxolone , a non-specific pannexin and activated p2x <dig> receptor inhibitor  <cit> . carbenoxolone significantly decreased the amount of atp released . in addition, probenecid , a selective pannexin  <dig> channel inhibitor  <cit>  as well as an abc transporter inhibitor  <cit> , significantly decreased the amount of atp released from slices stimulated by bz-atp measured by luminometry . these data indicate that the p2x <dig> receptor and pannexin  <dig> channels, alone or in a complex, and abc transporters may also be involved in atp-induced atp release.

mechanisms of constitutive atp release
our data indicated that purinergic receptors are not involved in the constitutive release of atp based on the lack of an effect on atp release in the presence of purinergic receptor antagonist ppads . thus, we tested the hypothesis that constitutive atp release in the olfactory epithelium is similar to that in other organ systems and investigated the role of pannexin/connexin hemi-channels, abc transporters and vesicular exocytosis  using both luminometry assays and quinacrine imaging. we measured atp release in the presence of the non-specific pannexin inhibitor carbenoxolone . carbenoxolone decreased the amount of constitutive atp released by half . in addition, the selective pannexin  <dig> and abc transporter inhibitor probenecid  significantly decreased the amount of atp released from oe slices . use of vesicular fusion inhibitor clostridium difficile toxin a  significantly impaired the release of atp compared to control conditions . we also used gadolinium chloride  that enhances spontaneous exocytosis in rat brain synaptosomes  <cit>  as well as inhibits pannexin and connexin hemichannels  <cit> . gd3+ significantly increased constitutive exocytotic release of atp . note that in the presence of gd3+, atp did not significantly enhance the release of atp compared to gd3+ alone or atp alone . these results suggest that exocytotic release of atp may have a greater role in the constitutive release of atp than release through pannexin/connexin hemichannels. in addition, gd3+-evoked vesicular release of atp may be operating at the maximum extent measurable under physiological conditions as atp did not enhance the release of atp in the presence of gd3+. alternatively, it may not be possible to observe a greater release of atp under the quinacrine experimental conditions, and it is not possible to measure the effects using luminometry as the trivalent cation interferes with the luciferin-luciferase assay. overall, our data show that a constitutive release of atp involves spontaneous exocytosis, abc transporters and pannexins in neonatal mouse oe.

we observed that degradation of extracellular atp by apyrase inhibited the release of atp to levels even lower than control . in mouse neuromuscular junction the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters is inhibited by stimulation of the g protein-coupled p2y purinergic receptors  <cit> . we hypothesized that in the presence of apyrase, the constitutively released atp could be degraded to adp that could inhibit the spontaneous release of atp via p2y <dig> , <dig> purinergic receptor activation. application of adp  significantly impaired the release of atp . this result confirms that activation of p2y <dig> , <dig> receptor subtypes inhibits the spontaneous vesicular release of atp. therefore, blockade of the p2y <dig> , <dig> receptors with ppads should prevent the inhibitory effect of adp. as expected, following ppads treatment , the amount of released atp after adp stimulation increased significantly and was back to control level . activation of p2y <dig> , <dig> receptors by adp can either activate or inhibit pka via adenylyl cyclase-mediated camp production. we therefore hypothesized that pka might be involved in the adp-induced inhibition of spontaneous atp exocytosis. if adp inhibits pka, we would expect that pka inhibition would have the same effect on spontaneous atp exocytosis as adp application alone. on the other hand, if adp activates pka, the pka inhibitor should increase the amount of released atp compared to adp alone. incubation with protein kinase inhibitor fragment 14– <dig>  prevented adp-mediated inhibition of the spontaneous atp exocytosis . taken together, these data suggest that stimulation of p2y <dig>  receptor subtypes that lead to pka activation down-regulates spontaneous exocytosis of atp occurring during the constitutive atp release in mouse neonate oe.

constitutive atp release induces proliferation
we previously observed that atp induces neuroproliferation via purinergic receptor activation  <cit> . to determine if constitutive atp release induces neuroproliferation, we examined the effect of clostridium difficile toxin a, an inhibitor of constitutive release of atp on cell proliferation in the oe. neonatal mice were intranasally instilled with either saline vehicle or  <dig> or 10 nm toxin a. three days post-instillation, mice were injected with brdu and 6 h later tissue was collected to visualize proliferating cells. clostridium difficile toxin a significantly decreased brdu incorporation throughout the oe and in the apical region of the oe compared to vehicle control . while we cannot rule out that the toxin might damage the oe, we would expect that cell damage or cell death caused by exposure to clostridium difficile toxin a should increase brdu incorporation because of post-injury neuroregeneration. thus, taken together, this data suggests that constitutive, toxin a sensitive-exocytosis of atp or another substance induces increased proliferation and may have a role in the normal turnover of both the olfactory sensory neurons and the sustentacular cells.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated the presence of atp-evoked atp release in neonatal mouse oe slices, and determined the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. we show that activation of purinergic receptors increases intracellular calcium which could subsequently induce calcium-dependent exocytosis of atp. although multiple p2y and p2x selective purinergic receptor agonists triggered release of atp, our data suggest that p2x <dig>  receptor subtypes play key roles. indeed, the selective p2x <dig>  agonist bzatp significantly increases the exocytotic release of atp. only small cations are permeable through the p2x <dig> receptor under physiological conditions. however, in the maintained presence of high concentrations of atp, when divalent cation levels are low, the p2x <dig> receptor can either form a non-selective pore  <cit> , or, after complexing with pannexin, form a large pore through which atp can flow  <cit> . bz-atp is maintained for 30s - 10 min in these studies, suggesting ample time to open the large pore of the p2x <dig> receptor.

in the oe, atp has been ascribed the functions of neuromodulation, neuroprotection and neuroproliferation by our laboratory and other research groups  <cit> . the evoked release of atp could be triggered pathologically by the presence of increased extracellular atp levels because of atp leaking from damaged cells. indeed, toxicant exposure depletes intracellular atp  <cit> , presumably due to released atp from damaged cells  <cit> . the evoked release of atp could play a role in any of these functions. the sustained release of atp could either induce the neuroprotective expression of heat shock proteins  <cit> , directly stimulate the progenitor cells to proliferate  <cit>  and differentiate  <cit> , or act indirectly by promoting the release of other neurotrophic factors  <cit> . thus, the results in this study identify the release mechanisms involved in atp-mediated post-injury neuroregeneration.

we previously showed indirectly that constitutive release of atp might modulate odorant responsiveness of the olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> . here, using luciferin-luciferase assays, we directly confirm that constitutive release of atp occurs via exocytosis and efflux through abc transporters. we also demonstrate a negative feedback system for constitutive atp release regulated by adp, p2y receptor stimulation and subsequent activation of pka. the exact mechanism of constitutive atp release inhibition is still unknown. to our knowledge, direct inhibition of exocytosis or abc transporters does not involve pka. p2y receptor activation inhibits spontaneous vesicular release of acetylcholine in the mouse neuromuscular junction, but does not require pka  <cit> . adp is rapidly degraded to adenosine. our previous work suggests that adenosine receptors are not expressed in the olfactory epithelium: we observed no responses to adenosine or amp during confocal calcium recordings  <cit> . however, adenosine may modulate adp’s activation of p2y receptors to regulate constitutive atp release.

we also postulate that constitutively released atp might play a role in neuronal homeostasis in the oe. purinergic receptor activation induces cell proliferation  <cit> , has post-injury proliferative and protective functions  <cit> , and elicits upregulation and/or release of many different neurotrophic factors  <cit> . here, we show constitutive exocytosis may induce cell proliferation. neuronal homeostasis must be tightly regulated to prevent over-stimulation of cell proliferation. the p2y receptor-mediated inhibition of the constitutive release of atp would provide negative regulation. further support for this negative feedback system is provided by the observation that basal progenitor cells of the oe express ectonucleotidases  <cit> . this provides a mechanism to degrade atp to adp, preventing excessive stimulation of p2y <dig> receptors present on the proliferative basal progenitor cells  <cit> , and inhibiting the constitutive release of atp. thus, there is local regulation of constitutive atp release.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe constitutive and purinergic receptor-mediated atp-evoked atp release via calcium-dependent vesicular exocytosis, pannexin/connexin hemichannels and abc transporters. overall, the demonstration that extracellular atp can elicit atp release provides a novel pathway with potential pharmacological targets to explore mechanisms of neuroregeneration and that have ramifications for the cns. likewise, the role of constitutive release of atp in neurogenesis under physiological conditions may be utilized to promote neuroregeneration following cell injury in neurodegenerative disease and spinal cord injury.
