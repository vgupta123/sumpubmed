BACKGROUND

desulfococcus biacutus strain kmracts is a gram-negative, sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium capable of using acetone as sole carbon and electron source  <cit> . due to the small energy budget of this bacterium, activation of acetone by carboxylation to acetoacetate with concomitant hydrolysis of two  atp equivalents, as found in aerobic and nitrate-reducing bacteria , is hardly possible. early physiological findings indicated that acetoacetate is not a free intermediate in the degradation pathway  <cit> . correspondingly, no acetone carboxylase activity was detected in cell-free extracts, and no acetone carboxylases were found in the genome and proteome of this bacterium . experiments with dense cell suspensions and cell-free extracts suggested that acetone may be activated through a carbonylation or a formylation reaction, and that acetoacetaldehyde rather than acetoacetate may be formed as an intermediate  <cit> . in cell-free extracts of acetone-grown d. biacutus cells, acetoacetaldehyde was trapped as its dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative and was identified by mass spectrometry, after reactions with acetone, atp and co as cosubstrates  <cit> . this reaction was not observed in cell-free extract of butyrate-grown cells, hence, the proposed acetone-activating enzyme, and most likely the entire acetone utilization pathway, is inducibly expressed in d. biacutus. nonetheless, the mechanism of the acetone activation reaction remains unknown so far.

a differential-proteomics approach comparing acetone- and butyrate-grown d. biacutus cells revealed several proteins/genes that were specifically and strongly induced in acetone-grown cells, but not in butyrate-grown cells  <cit> . one of the most prominent acetone-inducible proteins observed is encoded by gene  debiadraft_ <dig>  and is annotated as medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily alcohol dehydrogenase . other strongly induced proteins are a predicted thiamine diphosphate -requiring enzyme , and a cobalamin -binding subunit  of a methylmalonyl-coa mutase-like complex  <cit> .

alcohol dehydrogenases  usually catalyze the reversible oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, and the reactions are coupled to the reduction/oxidation of a pyridine nucleotide  <cit> . further, there are three types of adhs known which are classified by the absence or presence, and the type of incorporated metal ion: adhs that are independent of a metal ion, iron-dependent adhs, which can be oxygen-sensitive  <cit> , and zinc-dependent adhs; debiadraft_ <dig> is predicted as a zinc-dependent adh.

in the present study, we cloned, heterologously expressed, purified, and characterized the acetone-inducible gene/protein debiadraft_ <dig>  in an attempt to gain a better understanding of its possible role in the acetone utilization pathway of d. biacutus. this is also the first description of a functionally expressed recombinant enzyme originating from this bacterium.

RESULTS
predicted features of debiadraft_ <dig> based on its amino acid sequence
locus tag debiadraft_ <dig> was predicted  to encode a threonine dehydrogenase or related zn-dependent dehydrogenase, which belongs to the mdr superfamily of alcohol dehydrogenases: debiadraft_ <dig>  harbors conserved zinc-binding catalytic domains of alcohol dehydrogenases  with a groes-like structure and a nad-binding rossman fold. the predicted molecular mass of the debia-mdr monomer is  <dig>  da. the mdr-family proteins in bacteria and yeasts typically form tetramers  <cit> , and also for debia-mdr, a tetramer interface  was predicted  <cit>  .

while amino acid sequence identities of different mdr family enzymes can be only 20% or less  <cit> , debia-mdr exhibited up to 70% sequence identity to predicted, uncharacterized alcohol dehydrogenases, e.g., of desulfonatronovibrio magnus  and geobacter uraniireducens , and 47% sequence identity to a characterized alcohol dehydrogenase of c. beijerinckii nrrl b- <dig> , which utilizes acetone and butanal as substrates  <cit> . in addition, debia-mdr showed 21% sequence identity to a characterized acetoin reductase/ <dig> -butanediol dehydrogenase of clostridium beijerinckii  <cit> .

heterologous overproduction and purification of debia-mdr
recombinant expression of debia-mdr with high yield was obtained with e. coli rosetta  <dig> cells harboring the expression plasmid pet100-debia_04514n when grown in lb medium at 37 °c to an optical density of ~  <dig> : subsequently, cells were induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside , and upon induction, the medium was supplemented also with 3%  ethanol; addition of ethanol induces the heat-shock response and increases the production of chaperones  with positive effects on correct protein folding  <cit> . after induction, the cultures were incubated further for 5h at 18 °c.

figure 1a shows a representative preparation of his-tag purified protein separated on a denaturing sds-page gel. there was one major band with the expected molecular mass of approx. 41 kda . the identity of recombinant debia-mdr was confirmed by peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry. minor contaminations in the protein preparation  were identified as e. coli proteins, but not any other oxidoreductase . in addition, also a native page was performed in order to estimate the size of the native protein complex . here, purified debia-mdr appeared as a single protein band at about 170 kda molecular mass. thus, native debia-mdr has most likely a homotetrameric structure, which is in accordance with the bioinformatic prediction of a tetramer-binding domain in its amino acid sequence .fig.  <dig>

zinc- and nadh-dependency of debia-mdr
a zinc-dependency of the debia-mdr enzyme activity, as predicted by homology, was confirmed. for example, with acetone and nadh as substrates , no activity was detectable in the absence of zn2+. incubation of the enzyme preparation with 50 μm zn2+ for 30min prior to the enzyme assays led to a specific activity of  <dig>  mu mg- <dig> protein, while addition of 50 μm zn2+ to the enzyme preparation directly after the his-tag purification step  led to a maximal activity of 93 mu mg− <dig>  each with acetone and nadh as substrates. further, the enzyme in the presence of zn2+ was inhibited completely by addition of 100 μm hgcl <dig> as typical of zn-dependent mdr dehydrogenases, e.g., threonine 3-dehydrogenase of e. coli, 3-hydoxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase of p. putida, or a dehydrogenase of geotrichum capitatum . further, the enzyme accepted only nad+/nadh as electron acceptor/donor. no activity was detectable with nadp+/nadph, which is also typical of most mdr superfamily dehydrogenase enzymes  <cit> .

substrate range
the debia-mdr enzyme showed no reaction with l-threonine as substrate and nad+, as opposed to its initial sequence-based functional prediction. however, the enzyme exhibited activity with a range of short- and medium-chain aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, as illustrated in table  <dig>  with respect to the aldehydes tested , the enzyme showed highest specific activity in the reduction of propanal , followed by pentanal , butanal , isobutanal , 3-hydroxybutanal , and acetaldehyde ; no activity was detectable with formaldehyde or benzaldehyde. with respect to the non-substituted ketones tested , activities were generally lower than those with aldehydes: the enzyme showed highest activity for reduction of 3-pentanone , followed by 2-pentanone , propanone  , butanone , and 2-hexanone . the affinity  of the enzyme for acetone as substrate was determined to be  <dig>  mm , which is low compared to other acetone-reducing dehydrogenases, e.g., that of sulfolobus solfataricus  and equus caballus   <cit> . further, the enzyme exhibited high activity for reduction of substituted ketones, such as 3-hydroxybutanone  ,  <dig> -butanedione  , and 4-hydroxy-2-butanone . unfortunately, no substrate was available to test a reduction of 3-oxobutanal  . the activities for the corresponding reverse reactions with nad+ were lower, for example with propanol, butanol, or pentanol as substrates , or with  <dig> -butanediol  or  <dig> -butanediol ; exceptions were ethanol  and 2-butanol , while no activity was detectable with 3-hydroxybutanone  .

interestingly, we observed that the enzyme catalyzed also the oxidation of 3-hydroxybutanal with nad+, hence, a reaction in addition to the corresponding reductive reaction of the same substrate with nadh, though with lower apparent activity . thus, the debia-mdr appeared to be a bifunctional 3-hydroxybutanal reductase/dehydrogenase . a similar bi-functionality of the enzyme was confirmed with 4-hydroxy-2-butanone as substrate .

ph and temperature optimum
the effect of ph on the debia-mdr activity was tested in reactions with butanal and nadh as substrates, at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   and at ph  <dig>  . the ph optimum was between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  . further, the effect of temperature on the activity was tested in the range of 25 °c to 50 °c, with butanal and nadh in mops buffer, ph  <dig> , as described above. the highest specific activity was detected at 45 °c .

acetone-inducible butanal dehydrogenase / 3-hydroxybutanal reductase activity confirmed in cell-free extracts of d. biacutus
enzyme assays were performed also with cell-free extracts of d. biacutus, in order to confirm that the reductase/dehydrogenase activity attributed to debia-mdr is induced by acetone, as indicated already by the proteomics data  <cit> . for example, with butanal as substrate and nad+, cell-free extract of acetone-grown cells exhibited an activity of 20 ± 3 mu mg− <dig> protein, whereas in extracts of butyrate-grown cells, the activity was 10-fold reduced . also with 3-hydroxybutanal as substrate in the reductive direction with nadh, the activity was ca. 3-fold higher in extracts of acetone-grown cells  compared to that of butyrate-grown cells .

discussion
debia-mdr of desulfococcus biacutus, which was found previously to be inducibly expressed during growth with acetone  <cit> , was successfully cloned and overexpressed in e. coli. the features determined with the recombinant enzyme correspond well to those predicted from its amino acid sequence. the enzyme is active only in the presence of zinc, and with nad+/nadh as electron acceptor/donor, but not with nadp+/nadph. further, the activity of debia-mdr, as prepared in this study, was not sensitive to molecular oxygen, in contrast to iron-dependent dehydrogenases, which commonly are inactivated quickly under oxic conditions . the native enzyme showed a molecular mass of app. 170 kda, which corresponds well to its bioinformatically predicted homotetrameric structure. other described zinc-dependent adhs in bacteria and yeasts also exhibit a homotetrameric structure, while dimeric adhs can be found in higher plants and mammals . the enzyme exhibited a ph optimum between ph  <dig> and  <dig>  and a slightly elevated temperature optimum ; d. biacutus grows optimally at 30 °c and cannot grow at higher temperatures  <cit> . the enzyme showed reductase activity with aldehydes and ketones, preferably of a chain length of three to five carbon atoms, as far as tested in this study . moreover, based on the specific activities observed, aldehydes were preferred over ketones. a branched-chain aldehyde was also accepted , with an activity comparable to that with the linear analogue . the specific activities for alcohol oxidations determined were only about one fifth to one tenth of those for the respective reduction of aldehydes/ketones; these low activities are partly due to the unfavorable equilibria of these reactions, which typically are on the side of the alcohols.

based on the observed substrate range and catalytic efficiencies , and in the context of the yet limited information that is available on the acetone degradation pathway of d. biacutus, several roles of debia-mdr are to be considered.

first, the enzyme could play a role in the oxidation of isopropanol to acetone, since d. biacutus is able to utilize also isopropanol via the acetone pathway: our preliminary proteomic analyses of isopropanol-grown cells in comparison to acetone-grown cells  indicated that the same set of enzymes is expressed, e.g., the predicted thiamine diphosphate -requiring enzyme , the cobalamin -binding subunit of a methylmalonyl-coa mutase-like complex , and the zinc-dependent mdr described in this study . however, during growth with isopropanol, yet another dehydrogenase candidate  appeared to be additionally, and strongly produced in comparison to acetone-grown cells, and this candidate is predicted as iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. therefore, we suggest that this dehydrogenase, debiadraft_ <dig>  may be the dehydrogenase that funnels isopropanol into the acetone pathway, and not the zinc-dependent dehydrogenase examined in this study.

second, debia-mdr may have a detoxifying function, by reducing overproduced toxic aldehydes, which may be formed in the acetone activation pathway, to less toxic alcohols. for example, one proposed pathway  <cit>  that could involve the predicted tdp-requiring enzyme  and the b12-binding methylmalonyl-coa mutase-like complex  may proceed via a carbonylation  of acetone to 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanal  followed by linearization of this branched-chain aldehyde to 3-hydroxybutanal, respectively. hence, debia-mdr might play a role in a reversible conversion of, e.g., 3-hydroxybutanal to less toxic  <dig> -butanediol, as suggested by its high activity towards this reaction .

third, when considering the abovementioned proposed pathway, and as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  debia-mdr might also play a role in the oxidation of the proposed 3-hydroxybutanal intermediate to acetoacetaldehyde, as suggested by its high activity towards this reaction . moreover, the extremely reactive acetoacetaldehyde was previously shown  to appear at low concentration in cell-free extracts of d. biacutus in the presence of acetone and co  <cit> . notably, the specific activity of debia-mdr dehydrogenase for 3-hydroxybutanal oxidation to acetoacetaldehyde determined in vitro  is sufficient to explain the specific substrate turnover rate of d. biacutus during growth with acetone and sulfate   <cit> , though upstream and downstream processes may influence the rate of this reaction step in vivo.fig.  <dig> illustration of a postulated pathway for acetone degradation in desulfococcus biacutus with an attributed role of debia-mdr as 3-hydroxybutanal dehydrogenase. in this hypothetical pathway, acetone would be carbonylated or formylated to a branched-chain aldehyde and then isomerized to linear 3-hydroxybutanal. the 3-hydroxybutanal would be oxidized to acetoacetaldehyde by the enzyme described in this study. subsequently, acetoacetaldehyde could be converted to acetoacetyl-coa 




finally, in the context of the observed bifunctionality of debia-mdr for both oxidation and reduction of 3-hydroxybutanal, it is tempting to speculate further whether the enzyme might play roles for both detoxifying, e.g., 3-hydroxybutanal to  <dig> -butandiol and converting it to acetoacetyldehyde, dependent on the intracellular conditions: the latter reaction is catalyzed at lower rate, but may be facilitated if the subsequent enzyme in the pathway efficiently removes acetoacetaldehyde . on the other hand, at times of 3-hydroxybutanal accumulation, it may reversibly be deposited as less toxic  <dig> -butandiol .

CONCLUSIONS
clearly, more work lies ahead to reveal the unusual acetone activation pathway in d. biacutus, which is hampered by, e.g., the absence of molecular genetic methods for this bacterium, the unavailability of proposed intermediates for conducting appropriate enzyme tests, and by the extremely labile, oxygen-sensitive enzyme activities. however, in this study, we report the first heterologous overproduction of a functional protein from d. biacutus, exhibiting an aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase activity for a broad range of short- and medium chain aldehydes and ketones in vitro. the enzyme appears to be involved in acetone degradation by this bacterium, and its recombinant production may represent an important step in the elucidation of the complete degradation pathway.
