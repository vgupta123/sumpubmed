BACKGROUND
in the last decade genomic research has been characterised by the initiation and completion of a number of sequencing projects from a diverse array of genus/species, including grapevine. with two grapevine genome sequences completed  <cit>  the non-trivial task of identifying and assigning biological functions to the putative gene assignments begins  <cit> . the availability of sequenced genomes and comparative genomics currently makes it possible to identify putative orthologues quite rapidly  <cit> . the annotation of unknown proteins with unclear functions presents a significant challenge and potentially holds unique/novel information specifically for grapevine research. this study targeted the carotenoid biosynthetic/catabolic pathways of grapevine to provide a baseline understanding of the genes, their genomic organisation and their expression patterns in developing berries. previous studies reporting on genome organization and/or expression patterns in grapevine relied on ests, partial genome sequences or candidate genes. the carotenoid metabolic pathway is highly conserved and ubiquitous in photosynthetic organisms. . carotenoids are essential pigments in photosynthetic organisms  and are involved in a number of physiological and developmental processes. in plants, carotenoids accumulate in leaves, flowers and fruits; and their major function is the protection of the photosynthetic membranes. the enzymatic or oxidative cleavage of carotenoids leads to the formation of apocarotenoids with functions ranging from phytohormones  to volatile flavour/aroma compounds   of the respective genes and metabolites was used to follow carotenoid evolution during berry development in vitis vinifera l. cv sauvignon blanc. the corresponding cdna copies of  <dig> of the  <dig> orthologues identified have been isolated, sequenced and additionally four have been shown to be functional and are discussed in the broader context of carotenoid biosynthesis.

RESULTS
in silicocharacterisation of the carotenoid metabolic pathway genes fromvitis vinifera
forty two v. vinifera putative carotenoid metabolic gene orthologues were identified by in silico screening of the plaza  <cit>  grapevine database using the arabidopsis sequences obtained from atipd  <cit> . a multiple alignment was created using the  <dig> vitis sequences and the corresponding arabidopsis orthologues and a maximum likelihood method  <cit>  used to generate a bootstrapped molecular phylogenetic tree . sequence similarity was used to assign putative function to the identified grapevine orthologues. additional file  <dig> lists the grapevine gene name, the corresponding plaza accession, the associated roche nimblegen probe accession, the arabidopsis orthologue accession and the putative gene assignment.

additional file  <dig> shows the distribution of the  <dig>  genes identified and listed in additional file  <dig> in the grapevine genome. where possible the genes were positioned on the genome sequence assembly of the heterozygous entav <dig> described in velasco et al.  <cit> . five of the genes could not be localised on the entav <dig> genome sequence, but were localised in the pn <dig> genome sequence. the putative genes are shown on the corresponding linkage groups together with reference markers of the genetic map described in troggio et al.  <cit> . the carotenoid metabolic genes are distributed throughout the grapevine genome, and are positioned on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes . two tandem duplications are evident amongst the genes analysed: vvpdh <dig> and vvpdh <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  and vvccd <dig>  and vvccd <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  two segmental duplication events are also present: vvcyp707a <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and vvcyp707a <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  as well as vvbch <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and vvbch <dig> on chromosome  <dig> 

isolation and characterisation of  <dig> of the carotenoid metabolic pathway genes fromvitis vinifera
the full-length cdna copies of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes listed in additional file  <dig> were pcr-amplified from v. vinifera l. cv. pinotage cdna, namely: vvpsy <dig>  -pds <dig>  -zds <dig>  -lecy <dig>  -lut <dig>  -lbcy <dig>  lbcy <dig>  -bch <dig>  -zep <dig>  -vde <dig>  and –nced <dig>  the cdna fragments were isolated, cloned and verified by sequencing and submitted to genbank: vvpsy <dig> , -pds <dig> , -zds <dig> , -lecy <dig> , -lut <dig> , -lbcy <dig> , lbcy <dig> , -bch <dig> , -zep <dig> , -vde <dig> , and –nced <dig> . additional file  <dig> lists the genes, sequence information and the closest arabidopsis match in the publicly available grapevine sequence repositories.

the protcomp server  <cit>  was used to predict the sub-cellular localisation of the respective predicted proteins  . these results indicated that the predicted proteins of the v. vinifera genes are likely localised in the chloroplast, as found in other species  <cit> . the respective genomic sequences of the isolated carotenoid metabolic genes were identified based on homology to the cdna sequences. table  <dig> lists the sizes of the full-length cdna- and genomic copies of the isolated grapevine genes as well as the associated linkage groups. analysis of the genomic structure of a subset of the carotenoid metabolic genes  showed that the number of exons of the isolated carotenoid metabolic genes in the available plant genomes is remarkably well conserved . the degree of identity between the predicted amino acid sequence for each isolated grapevine carotenoid biosynthetic/catabolic genes and the respective orthologues in a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and o. sativa was calculated. the amino acid sequences of the grapevine genes are highly conserved and phylogenetically more similar to members of the eudicots  than the monocots  .

expression analysis of the  <dig> carotenoid metabolic genes in developingvitis viniferal. cv sauvignon blanc berries
the expression of the  <dig> carotenoid biosynthetic/catabolic genes listed in additional file  <dig> was analysed by nimblegen microarrays . the expression data . cluster analysis was used to identify and group the carotenoid metabolic genes having similar developmental expression patterns .

from figures  <dig> and  <dig> it can be seen that the expression of six of the carotenoid metabolic genes increased throughout the berry developmental stages: vvpdh <dig>  vvziso <dig>  vvlbcy <dig>  vvvde <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b. the expression of vvccd4b increased dramatically from relatively low levels in the green stage reaching ~256-fold upregulation by vérasion and ~315-fold by ripe/harvest stage . similarly, but to a lesser extent, vvccd4a shows a 13-fold upregulation at the ripe/harvest stage . conversely the expression of ten genes decreases as the season progresses: vva8h-cyp707a <dig> , vvbch <dig>  vvlbcy <dig>  vvlut <dig>  vvnced <dig>  vvpdh <dig>  vvpds <dig>  vvpsy <dig>  vvzep <dig> and vvzep <dig>  vva8h-cyp707a <dig>  displays the most downregulation, reaching a 70-fold decrease from the green to the ripe/harvest stage. similarly, the expression of vvbch <dig>  vvlut <dig>  vvpsy <dig> and vvnced <dig> is downregulated 4-6-fold by the ripe/harvest stage . the expression profiles of a number of genes change at or around the véraison stage. for vva8h-cyp707a <dig>  vvccd <dig> , vvccd <dig> , vvciso <dig>  vvnced <dig>  vvnsy <dig>  vvpsy <dig>  vvvde <dig> and vvzds <dig> the expression peaks at véraison; and for vvlecy <dig>  vvmax <dig> and vvvde <dig> the expression is lowest at véraison and increases up until the ripe/harvest stage. absolute expression values were constitutively low for vva8h-cyp707a2_ <dig>  vva8h-cyp707a <dig>  vvaba <dig>  vvbch <dig>  vvccd4c vvccd <dig> and vvccd <dig> in the berry stages investigated, and transcriptional regulation of these genes may be tissue-specific and/or developmental regulated. vvbch <dig> was, however, shown to be functional in a heterologous complementation system .

only vvzds <dig>  vvziso <dig>  vvaba <dig>  vvlecy <dig>  vvlut <dig>  vvlut <dig>  vvnsy <dig>  vvccd <dig> and vvccd <dig> occur as single copy genes in the grapevine genome; the rest of the carotenoid metabolic genes have more than one paralogue . the different isoforms of the carotenoid metabolic genes typically have distinctly different expression patterns . for example, the expression profiles of the three putative vvpds/pdh-encoding genes have three distinct expression patterns: vvpds <dig> and vvpdh <dig> have similar profiles with expression decreasing as the growth season progresses. vvpdh <dig>  however, has an inverse expression pattern and increased, peaking at harvest. vvzep <dig> and vvzep <dig> are an exception and have a similar expression pattern  .

four groupings of genes are of particular interest in the pathway representation in figure 2:  the genes encoding for enzymes involved in the violaxanthin- and lutein epoxide  cycles involved in photoprotection ;  genes encoding for enzymes that cleave carotenoids to form the phytohormone aba ;  genes encoding for enzymes that cleave carotenoids to form the phytohormone strigolactone ; and  genes encoding for enzymes that cleave carotenoids to form volatile flavour- and aroma-related compounds e.g. β-ionone  <cit> .

carotenoids and chlorophylls in developing sauvignon blanc berries
the photosynthetic pigments  were monitored at the three sampling time-points. additional file  <dig> and figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the changes in carotenoid and chlorophyll concentrations during ripening in the grape berries. the majority of the photosynthetic pigments  decreased throughout ripening . the total carotenoid content decreases approximately 3-fold during ripening/maturation . this trend can be mainly attributed to decreases in lutein and β-carotene that represent the most abundant carotenoids in berries . interestingly, the xanthophylls zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin showed an inverse trend by increasing, with zeaxanthin peaking at harvest ; and antheraxanthin peaking at véraison . the ratio of carotenoids/chlorophylls  as well as the ratio of chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b  remains relatively constant throughout the sampling stages.

aba was measured at the three sampling time-points. additional file  <dig> shows the changes in aba levels during ripening in the grape berries. the skin and pulp  were analysed collectively. aba concentration increased from the initial green stage, peaking at véraison. aba levels increase ~5-fold from the green to véraison stage, and decreases ~4-fold from the véraison stage to the ripe/harvest stage.

discussion
distribution of the carotenoid metabolic genes in the grape genome
the number of grapevine cultivars is estimated at between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the availability of this relatively large germplasm collection, and the fact that crosses between wild and domesticated grape species result in fertile hybrids; makes the use of marker assisted selection  particularly useful for breeders. mas allows the monitoring of segregation patterns of specific markers in the progeny, as well as the potential to identify genotypes with multiple loci at a relatively early stage.

gene targeted markers  are especially useful for the mas approach because in this case the marker coincides with the gene sequence and it is strictly associated with the trait of interest, if known. an example of the potential of this approach in grapevine has been reported by battilana and co-workers  <cit> . they demonstrated that the dxs gene  is the major determinant of monoterpene content in the grapes by qtl analysis and candidate gene approach. similarly, linking the genes of the carotenoid metabolic pathway to a viticultural/oenological quality parameter can facilitate targeted marker-assisted  breeding.

here we show that the carotenoid metabolic genes are distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> grapevine chromosomes  and we identified the flanking molecular markers. moreover, through functional complementation assays in bacteria, we confirm the functions of vvpsy <dig>  vvlecy <dig>  vvlbcy <dig> and vvbch <dig>  thus providing functional markers for carotenoid metabolism . the system showed conversion of the substrates to form the products shown in table  <dig>  confirming the usefulness of this bacterial system for heterologous expression of plant carotenoid metabolic genes. the reasons for the partial or incomplete conversion observed in the functional complementation assay were not investigated, but is possibly due to the difficulties experienced when expressing plant  proteins in bacterial  systems.

the grapevine orthologues involved in the formation of the phytohormone strigolactone: vvccd <dig>  vvccd <dig> and vvmax <dig> have been identified. the absolute expression values of all three genes remained relatively low in the berry stages analysed . whether or not these genes are transcriptionally active in other plant organs  is currently not known and requires further study.

the in silico analysis showed conservation of the number of exons of the isolated carotenoid biosynthetic/catabolic genes across plant species. this phenomenon has previously been observed in carotenoid metabolic genes in both the maize and rice phytoene desaturase encoding  genes  <cit>  and to a lesser extent in the ccd gene family   <cit> . the reason for the observed conservation of intron number/density/abundance is unclear but the phenomenon seems quite common. for example, a study comparing  <dig> human and mouse orthologous genes found that 95% of these genes had the same number of exons  <cit> .

carotenoid biosynthesis and catabolism in developing sauvignon blanc berries
grapevine berry development and ripening is a relatively well-studied process. the carotenoid content of grapevine berries has similarly received much attention and typically a steady decline in the abundance of carotenoids after véraison occurs  <cit> . this decline in the carotenoid content of grape berries appears to be associated with the disappearance of chloroplasts  <cit>  and the formation of important aromatic c13-norisoprenoids  in a number of cultivars including sauvignon blanc  <cit> . crupi et al.  <cit>  suggested that this change in carotenoid concentration from véraison to harvest can be correlated with the ultimate flavour and aroma of grapes and wine. as alluded to by kamffer et al.  <cit>  and subsequently demonstrated by lashbrooke et al.  <cit> ; the analysis of the carotenoid and chlorophyll content of grapevine berries is technically quite challenging due to the susceptibility of these compounds to degradation. papers utilising hplc to determine carotenoid content often show evidence of chlorophyll degradation products in the respective chromatograms  . it is generally not reported if this is an artifact of the extraction method, or a true reflection of the carotenoid content of the berries  <cit> . lashbrooke et al.  <cit> , however, showed that conditions leading to the degradation of chlorophylls  also lead to a degradation of carotenoids. since degradation is not constant for all the pigments investigated ; an internal standard will not compensate accurately for this loss and this should be considered when attempting to correlate metabolite levels to, for example, transcript levels.

the total carotenoid concentration of the sauvignon blanc berries showed a gradual decrease throughout the growth season with the lowest levels at harvest . the concentration of only two carotenoids increased, namely: zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin . in photosynthetic tissues, these two xanthophylls  are involved in the xanthophyll  cycle: the reversible enzymatic conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin . under normal, non-stressed conditions, zeaxanthin is converted to violaxanthin by zeaxanthin epoxidase . however, when photoprotection is required, violaxanthin is rapidly converted via antheraxanthin to zeaxanthin by violaxanthin de-epoxidase . grapevine berries photosynthesise during the early stages of development in which case the carotenoids play a crucial role in the photosynthetic membranes by harvesting light and assisting in photoprotection  <cit> . the decline in total carotenoids closely follows the decline observed in total chlorophylls . only zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin showed an increase during ripening. carotenoids have been shown to be more abundant in the skin versus the pulp or juice and although the abundance of carotenoids in berries is approximately 100-times lower than in leaves; the ratios of the photosynthetic pigments in berries are similar. similar studies have shown comparable trends in carotenoid levels. in a water stress study conducted on berries of cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay grapevine cultivars, the well-watered control plants of both cultivars showed a decrease in carotenoids during ripening  <cit> . chlorophyll levels, however, were relatively low and antheraxanthin decreased and zeaxanthin could not be quantified at all. the authors attributed the low levels of chlorophylls  as being artifacts of the extraction protocol, but added that carotenoid levels were unaffected. lashbrooke et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that carotenoids  are degraded under the conditions described in deluc et al.  <cit>  with the individual pigments having varying susceptibilities to degradation. degradation would most likely have affected the concentration of other carotenoids, without necessarily affecting the observed trends.

interestingly, the pigment analysis of the carotenoids showed the presence of lutein  <dig>  epoxide; a xanthophyll involved in the lutein epoxide  cycle  . the lx cycle occurs in the α-carotene branch of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and functions similarly to the violaxanthin pathway : during low light conditions  there is an accumulation of lutein  <dig>  epoxide that is de-epoxidised to lutein following light exposure. it is thought that the lx cycle requires the same enzymes as the violaxanthin cycle   <cit> , although there is some doubt whether lutein is a substrate for zep  <cit> . kinetic experiments by matsubara et al.  <cit>  showed that the conversion of lx to lutein is only slowly reversible. the authors speculated that the lx cycle serves as an additional, slower reversible mechanism of photoprotection that supplements the violaxanthin cycle in shade plants. not all plant species accumulate lx, and the lx cycle has been described as having an irregular taxonomical distribution in unrelated taxa  <cit> . here we show that grapevine forms the carotenoids for both a violaxanthin cycle  as well as an lx cycle ; and possesses two isoforms for each of the required enzymes  . little is known about the regulation of these two pathways: that dedicated enzymes  are required is improbable since the carotenoid substrates occur in the same localisation , and whether or not transcriptional regulation is involved requires further study.

in later stages of berry development the products of the enzymatic cleavage of carotenoids  are known to be potent flavour and aroma compounds . previous work in berries of muscat of alexandria and shiraz  <cit> , trincadeira  <cit> , and chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon  <cit>  grapevine cultivars showed that expression of the grapevine vvccd <dig> was induced approaching véraison. vvccd <dig> was shown to be functional and can cleave both lutein and zeaxanthin, but not β-carotene, to form 3-hydroxy-β-ionone  <cit> . the authors showed a concomitant increase in the glycosylated and free forms of c13-norisoprenoids in berries of both cultivars . it is currently not known if vvccd <dig> is capable of cleaving additional carotenoids present in berries. vvccd4a has recently been identified in grapevine and the authors reported the upregulation of the gene towards the end of ripening  <cit> . the authors suggest a possible role of ccd4a in berry colour, flavour and aroma of chardonnay berries, even though functionality could not be demonstrated with a number of carotenoid substrates that included β-carotene and zeaxanthin  <cit> . similarly, our data shows upregulation of vvccd4a as well as vvccd4b during ripening in sauvignon blanc .

in grapevine, aba, together with other phytohormones , is thought to be responsible for the control of grape berry ripening and aba levels typically peak at or around véraison  <cit> . due to its importance, the components and regulation of the aba biosynthetic pathway has similarly received much attention  <cit> . wheeler et al.  <cit>  showed that the expression pattern of two genes known to be crucial to aba synthesis in plants  could not be correlated to changes in aba levels in grapevine berries. sun et al.  <cit> , however, showed that vvnced <dig>  transcript levels correlated to the aba content in peel, seed and pulp. these studies have illustrated the complex developmental regulation of aba levels in a ripening berry  <cit> . our results show that aba levels increased from the initial green stage, peaking at véraison. a decrease in aba occurs after véraison. it should also be noted that both skin and pulp  were analysed collectively in this study. grimplet et al.  <cit>  have shown that more than 28% of transcripts in the berry display a more than 2-fold difference in transcript levels between the major tissue types: skin, pulp and seeds. the authors reported that most of the genes involved in carotenoid metabolism displayed a skin-specific expression pattern.

in a similar study, two vvnced-encoding genes were identified in grapevine : vvnced <dig>  and vvnced <dig>   <cit> . the authors reported that the vvnced <dig>  and vvnced <dig>  cdna sequences are  <dig> % identical. based on expression studies they showed that the majority of the detectable nced expression in leaf tissue was vvnced1-derived and that vvnced <dig> transcription was comparatively low and appears to be associated with the leaf aba concentration. the authors hypothesised that vvnced <dig> responds to stresses , whereas vvnced <dig> performs more of a “house-keeping” function in leaves  <cit> . a study by lund et al.  <cit>  on cabernet sauvignon berries showed that vvnced <dig> expression was not significantly changed during berry ripening initiation , whereas vvnced <dig> showed upregulation in the later stages of ripening initiation. vvnced <dig> was also shown to be upreguated in maturing seeds in the same study.

from the expression analysis in sauvignon blanc grape berry from our study  it is clear that the three vvnceds have distinctly different expression profiles. vvnced <dig> expression decreases as berry ripening progresses; whereas vvnced <dig> expression peaks at véraison. vvnced <dig> shows low expression levels in all of the berry stages, but increases after véraison. since it has been demonstrated that the aba levels peak at véraison   <cit> , the transcriptomic analysis from this study supports the findings of sun et al.  <cit>  that vvnced <dig> is the enzymatic isoform correlated to the content of aba in sauvignon blanc berries.

the role and possible interplay of the nced isoforms in the different tissue types of berries, as well as other grapevine tissues/organs, requires further elucidation. this study analysed vvnced expression and aba levels in the skin and pulp collectively without the seeds. differential expression of vvnceds has previously been reported in the skin , pulp  and seed of cabernet sauvignon during ripening initiation  with vvnced <dig> being transcriptionally upregulated at the later stages of véraison  <cit> .

due to the role of carotenoids and apocarotenoids to abiotic stress  and quality factors ; these compounds have been extensively studied . for example, the effect of environmental conditions on carotenoid metabolic genes is well known, but typically studied via a candidate gene approach. collectively these studies have revealed the complex nature of carotenoid regulation that can occur at multiple levels, and although relatively well studied biochemically, the transcriptional regulation of this pathway is still not well understood. in general, it is becoming increasingly clear that an integrated analysis at the molecular level is required to elucidate function and gene-to-metabolite and/or metabolite-to-metabolite interactions.

similarly, several of the isoforms of the carotenoid metabolic genes have distinctly different expression profiles and thus one can speculate that they have distinctly different functions in the developing grape berry and/or other grapevine organs. further work investigating the environmental factors and relative changes in other plant metabolites present in berries at these stages will contribute to our understanding of the regulation of these genes.

from the cluster analysis in figure <dig> it seems that a number of the carotenoid metabolic genes with similar profiles are possibly co-regulated/co-responding. analysis of the upstream promoter sequences of these gene clusters could aid in the identification of berry-specific/developmental-specific transcription factor binding sites. although not addressed in this study, the availability of two grapevine genomic sequence makes this approach feasible.

CONCLUSIONS
forty-two vitis vinifera carotenoid metabolic pathway genes have been putatively identified and eleven have been isolated, sequenced and characterised in this study. the genes and their predicted protein sequences are highly conserved as reported in other plant studies. the grapevine genomic sequence facilitates the characterisation of gene functions and interactions, but more importantly facilitates the study of the complex frameworks between genes controlling metabolic pathways and ultimately the relationship of genes to phenotype. in a crop like grapevine, the ability to analyse the molecular “phenotype” is useful for quantifying the impact of, for example, a viticultural practice or a specific stress condition .

the genes of the carotenoid metabolic pathway potentially form the basis for a number of genomic applications that include: gene-associated molecular marker developments , biochemical characterisation of the corresponding recombinant proteins and transgenic approaches to manipulate carotenoid biosynthesis. collectively these data form the most up-to-date pathway analysis and a baseline that will broaden our understanding of this central metabolic pathway and provides insights into the evolution of these compounds that also serve as substrates for quality impact factors  and regulating phytohormones .
