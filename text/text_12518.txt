BACKGROUND
septins are a conserved family of gtpases implicated in various cellular processes. septin-requiring processes include cytokinesis, polarity establishment, cell cycle checkpoints and formation of a diffusion barrier in yeast  <cit> , as well as cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking and exocytosis in mammalian cells  <cit> . in humans,  <dig> septin genes have been found so far, many of which also undergo alternative splicing generating dozens of polypeptides  <cit> . septins can be isolated from cytosol as hetero-polymeric complexes, which have the ability to polymerize and assemble into higher-order structures in vitro  <cit> . how the polymerisation is regulated and how such higher order assemblies contribute to septin function in vivo is far from clear.

septin <dig>  is the best-characterised member of the septin family so far. it is ubiquitously expressed and belongs to the acidic subgroup of the septin family consisting of a short n-terminus, a conserved gtpase domain and a coiled coil structure at the c-terminus  <cit> . septin <dig> forms a complex together with septin <dig> and septin <dig> in vitro  <cit>  and also co-localises with these septins in vivo  <cit> . kinoshita and colleagues showed that septin <dig> is required for cytokinesis  <cit> . microinjection of an anti-septin <dig> antibody interfered with cell division resulting in bi-nucleated cells. how septin <dig> functions during cytokinesis is unclear. however, its localisation to the contractile ring and midbody structure in the cleavage furrow during late stages of mitosis is consistent with a functional role of septin <dig> in limiting diffusion of membrane proteins across the cleavage furrow  <cit> .

in interphase cells septin <dig> co-localises with actin bundles, and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin or cytochalasin perturbs septin <dig> distribution, inducing curved or circular septin2-containing assemblies  <cit> . reduction in septin <dig> expression level in cells results in attenuation of actin fibres, implying a functional inter-relationship between actin and septin <dig>  an in vitro bundling assay showed that the interaction between actin bundles and recombinant septin2/septin6/septin <dig> can be mediated by the bundling protein anillin  <cit> . although these in vitro results suggest a mechanism to account for the recruitment of septin <dig> to the actin contractile ring during cytokinesis, it is unlikely that anillin has the same function in interphase cells. anillin is sequestered in the nucleus in interphase cells  <cit>  and the functional significance of the co-localisation between actin and septin <dig> in this phase of the cell cycle is still elusive. more generally, although artificial perturbation of actin cytoskeleton can cause re-arrangement of septin <dig> in cells it is not clear that this phenomenon is ever replicated during normal cell function.

here we characterise the mutual inter-dependence of the actin cytoskeleton and septin <dig> using a range of in vivo approaches. both knock down of septin <dig> expression and a specific septin <dig> truncation mutant resulted in loss of visible actin fibres or bundles. expression of dominant-negative mutants of the actin-regulating rho-gtpases rhoa, rac <dig> and cdc <dig> caused re-organisation of both cortical actin and septin <dig>  significantly, in ruffling and migrating cells we observed wholesale redistribution of septin <dig> into ring-like structures with morphology and dynamics highly similar to those previously observed upon depolymerisation of actin filaments with latrunculin. we propose that septin <dig> is required for actin bundling, and that global re-organisation of the actin cytoskeleton in migrating or ruffling cells triggers concomitant re-organisation of septin <dig> into a distinct functional state.

RESULTS
septin <dig> and actin define interdependent systems
we sought to understand the functional relationship between actin cytoskeleton and septin <dig> in vivo. as a first step, indirect immunofluorescence was used to characterise the distribution of these molecules in nrk cells. in interphase cells septin <dig> had a filamentous and granular appearance, and co-localised with actin bundles  <cit> . the interaction with actin bundles, however, was not uniform along the entire length of the actin; septin <dig> rather partially decorated the bundle  <cit> . septin <dig> did not co-localise with vinculin, a marker for focal adhesions . as previously shown in 3t <dig> cells  <cit> , disruption of actin filaments upon latrunculin b treatment resulted in a striking loss of linear septin <dig> staining and rearrangement of septin <dig> into o- and c-shaped rings . these septin <dig> rings were sometimes found together with actin-containing particles, but ring-like structures devoid of actin were also visible . thus we could observe the dependence of septin <dig> morphology on actin polymerisation described previously  <cit> . this dependence suggested that septin- and actin-cytoskeletal networks could be functionally inter-dependent. some members of the septin family also interact with microtubules  <cit> . for septin <dig>  however, we were not able to establish such an association . in regions of the cell where septin <dig> co-localised with tubulin was always actin present as well . nocodazole treatment, which disrupts microtubules, slightly attenuated septin <dig> filaments, but did not have a big effect on overall septin <dig> organisation .

in order to test directly the requirement for septin <dig> function in maintaining the actin cytoskeleton, we performed rnai to knock down septin <dig> expression in cells. nrk and hela cells were transfected separately with two different sirnas based on the septin <dig> sequence. both sirnas produced equivalent effects, and control sirnas produced none of the effects described below.  <dig> hrs after transfection cell morphology was severely compromised and the overall amount of cells was reduced to  <dig> ±  <dig> % of control levels. 70–90% of the remaining cells showed a decreased septin <dig> staining by immunofluorescence. there was no indication of selective arrest of the cell cycle at mitosis or cytokinesis, implying that septin <dig> is required for correct cell morphology and adhesion or viability during interphase. western blot analysis of whole cell homogenate revealed a 60% reduction of septin <dig> level . the most interesting observation was the effect on the actin cytoskeleton. overall actin level  was reduced to 45% of control levels , and in cells where septin <dig> staining was diminished actin staining was markedly reduced as well . in fact, actin bundles were no longer present in these cells and the weak residual actin staining was restricted to the cell periphery. in contrast, microtubule organisation was not affected upon knocking down septin <dig> levels by sirna  and the amount of tubulin present in cells was unchanged .

the loss of actin fibres in cells with reduced septin <dig> expression could either be a consequence of reduced actin protein levels or could reflect a more direct role for septin <dig> function in maintaining actin fibres. given that septin <dig> forms complexes with other septins and, potentially, further proteins, we reasoned that in the latter case over-expression of septin <dig> might be sufficient to sequester or perturb factors required for actin bundling. over-expression of full length yfp-septin <dig>  resulted in the formation of large polymeric structures . untagged full length septin <dig> also formed those structures when over-expressed, indicating that their formation was not dependent on the presence of yfp in the fusion protein . induction of these anomalous structures correlated directly with a marked decrease in actin bundles . in order to ascertain which region of septin <dig> is required for this effect various truncated yfp-septin <dig> constructs were produced, containing different domains of the protein  <cit> . nrk cells transfected with yfp-septin2-pb/g, a construct containing the n-terminus and the gtpase domain but lacking the coiled-coil domain , showed a more or less punctate distribution . in comparison to full length yfp-septin <dig>  no filaments aligned with actin stress fibres were visible, but actin organisation was not affected by over-expression of this construct. in marked contrast, a construct containing only the n-terminal polybasic domain  induced loss of actin bundles, and an apparent reduction in total actin staining to approximately 70% of control levels. yfp-septin2-pb localized as a cytosolic haze. staining with septin <dig> antibodies revealed that endogenous septin <dig> has a normal distribution in yfp-septin2-pb-expressing cells. a third construct that lacks just the polybasic domain  did not affect actin bundles and had a more punctate distribution. constructs fused to a myc-tag or untagged truncated versions of septin <dig> showed the same distributions. taken together, these experiments show that over-expression of septin <dig> is sufficient to ablate actin bundles. however, the large polymeric structures induced by septin <dig> over-expression are not themselves required for this effect as a construct containing only the polybasic region of septin <dig> is sufficient to induce the same effect on actin bundles whilst having a diffuse cytoplasmic localisation. the finding that the polybasic region plus gtpase domain construct did not have the same effects hints at a regulatory role for the gtpase domain.

another way of determining the extent of interdependence between actin and septin <dig> is to perturb actin organisation by interfering with regulators of actin organization. rho gtpases are such regulators and have diverse effects on the actin filament system  <cit> . rhoa, rac <dig> and cdc <dig> are the best-characterised family members, and each controls the formation of a distinct actin-containing structure. we studied the effects of the gdp-locked form of rhoa, rac <dig> and cdc  <dig> on septin <dig> distribution. nrk cells were transfected with myc-tagged dominant-negative mutants of these gtpases and cells were stained for actin and septin <dig>  although all mutants altered the appearance of the actin cytoskeleton and also affected septin <dig> organisation, their effects on these two systems were quite diverse . in cells expressing the gdp-locked form of rac <dig> central actin bundles were attenuated or missing and the formation of thick actin bundles in the cell periphery was induced . septin <dig> was no longer associated with these bundles. the filamentous organisation of septin <dig> was fragmented resulting in the formation of rings similar to those seen after latrunculin treatment . the cdc42-mutant, although increasing the prominence of actin bundles, had only a slight effect on septin <dig>  septin <dig> still exhibited the filamentous-granular appearance but with more pronounced filaments . cells transfected with the dominant-negative mutant of rhoa showed the most severe phenotype. the majority of the cells lost their ability to attach to the surface of the coverslip, which is explained by rhoa having a role in regulation the formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions, necessary prerequisites for proper cell attachment  <cit> . rhoa-mutant expressing cells that were still left on the coverslip had a disrupted actin and septin <dig> organisation, with a reduction in both actin filaments and septin filaments . all these experiments again clearly show the mutual dependence and regulation of septin and actin filaments.

septin <dig> and actin have distinct distributions in moving and ruffling cells
both actin depolymerisation and expression of rho-family-gtpase mutants are non-physiological perturbations and functional significance of resultant changes in septin <dig> distribution was unclear. we therefore sought a more physiological situation where parallel re-organisation of actin and septin <dig> could be assayed. in nrk cells migrating into an experimentally wounded monolayer actin is concentrated in the leading-edge lamellipodia and ruffles characteristic of many moving cells   <cit> . septin <dig>  however, was not detectable in these ruffling lamellipodia at the leading edge. it was segregated from actin and was localised in the cell body . the appearance of septin <dig> in the cell body of ruffling cells was distinct to normal cells and very variable. instead of filaments, septin <dig> formed arc-shaped structures, o-and c-shaped rings and circles with diameters ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  μ , and punctae. the ring-like structures were not at all associated with actin, but were similar to rings observed after disrupting the actin cytoskeleton upon latrunculin treatment . lamellipodial extensions and ruffling can readily be induced in nrk cells by growing on lysine-coated coverslips . as one would predict, actin and rac <dig>  a gtpase known to be involved in formation of lamellipodia, are readily detectable in the ruffles  <cit> . septin <dig> was exclusively localized in the cell body, and was found in o-and c-shaped rings and circles as in migrating cells . these results imply that although septin <dig> is associated with actin bundles and plays an important role in regulating these structures, it is not associated with actin in situations where actin organisation is more dynamic. septin <dig> that does not interact with actin forms variable curled and ring-like structures morphologically highly similar to those induced by actin depolymerisation.

the filaments and rings formed by septin <dig> in vivo are highly dynamic
to gain more insight into septin <dig> dynamics we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching . in a frap experiment fluorescent molecules are irreversibly bleached in a small area of the cell . subsequent diffusion of surrounding non-bleached molecules into the bleached area leads to recovery and is monitored over time. we used full length yfp-septin <dig> for bleaching experiments and investigated the dynamics of gfp-actin in parallel . yfp-septin <dig> had the same distribution as endogenous septin <dig> in interphase and dividing cells and it did not alter the organisation of endogenous septin <dig>  <cit> . first we checked whether septin <dig> filaments, which are associated with actin stress fibres in normal nrk cells, are dynamic structures. photobleaching of a part of the filament showed a recovery of fluorescence over time . there was no difference in the dynamics of recovery in the middle or at the end of the septin <dig> filament. although maximal recovery was only about 63% ±  <dig>  of the initial fluorescence, the original structure of the septin <dig> filament was clearly reformed.

next we looked at the dynamics of the septin <dig> positive ring-like structures formed in the cell body of ruffling cells. time-lapse movies of these cells revealed a very active behaviour of septin <dig> and a relationship between septin <dig> filaments and rings. for example, as shown in fig. 6c starting with an s-shaped filament half of a ring was formed. after  <dig> s an o-shaped structure with a diameter of  <dig>  μm was seen which then further condensed into a smaller ring . the diameter of this ring was  <dig>  μm and the morphology was comparable to rings observed after latrunculin treatment  and perturbation of actin/septin <dig> organisation by rac1-mutant . instead of remaining in this structure the ring opened again and formed two half rings which were  <dig>  μm apart from each other . the two halves then came together again, this time forming a c-shaped structure . many examples of this cycle of opening and closing were observed and sometimes a disappearing and appearing of a ring-like structure was also detected. frap experiments of these ring structures in ruffling cells  confirmed that constant exchange of yfp-septin <dig> into and out of these structures occurs. halftimes for recovery  and amount of recovery , however, were very variable . sometimes the recovered structure was distinct to the initially bleached structure in terms of position and morphology .

next we investigated whether septin <dig> rings induced by latrunculin have equivalent properties to those seen in ruffling or migrating cells. septin <dig> rings formed upon latrunculin treatment also recovered after photobleaching, with comparable dynamics . careful morphological comparison of ring structures in ruffling cells and in latrunculin treated cells again revealed considerable similarity. rings formed upon latrunculin treatment had a slightly more uniform outer diameter  but were similar in size to ring-like structures in ruffling cells . in summary, septin <dig> can participate in large-scale macromolecular assemblies with differing morphologies in response to differing physiological situations and remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. in all instances these assemblies are highly dynamic with constant exchange of septin <dig> in and out.

discussion
previous experiments have shown that septin <dig> partially co-localises with actin fibres, that actin can affect septin <dig> polymerisation in vitro, that depletion of septin <dig> perturbs the morphology of actin bundles, and that depolymerisation of actin fibres can cause changes in septin <dig> morphology. in this study we provide additional direct evidence for the in vivo significance of actin and septin <dig> interaction. thus we show for the first time that septin <dig> expression is required for maintenance of normal actin protein levels, that over-expression of a truncated version of septin <dig> causes loss of visible actin bundling without perturbing the distribution of endogenous septin <dig>  and that the circular and ring-shaped septin <dig> structures induced by actin de-polymerisation are also found in physiological situations where the actin cytoskeleton is radically remodeled.

partial co-localisation between septin <dig> and the tubulin network has also been reported  <cit> . our immunofluorescence data, however, argue, that the interaction between septin <dig> and microtubules is different from the septin2-actin interplay and is not crucial for microtubule integrity. although septin <dig> distribution is slightly affected upon nocodazole treatment, this effect is less severe and not comparable with the disruption of septin <dig> organisation upon latrunculin treatment . moreover, neither knock-down of septin <dig> expression upon sirna nor overexpression of truncated septin <dig> constructs affected microtubule organisation . since in regions of the cell where septin <dig> co-localises with tubulin we always find actin as well, we do not think that there is a direct interaction between septin <dig> and tubulin, as has been shown for other septins  <cit> . the distinct distribution of septin <dig>  which is associated with tubulin and is clearly affected upon nocodazole treatment, and septin <dig> in dividing cells also suggests that the co-localisation seen between septin <dig> and tubulin is not functionally significant  <cit> .

septin <dig> and actin distributions, however, are clearly highly interdependent. overexpression of gdp-locked form of rhoa, cdc <dig> and rac <dig> highlights this interplay . at this point we do not know how these gtpases act in this context, whether it is via modulating actin dynamics and/or controlling septin <dig> dynamics. it is known that the cdc <dig> effectors borg <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> can bind to septins in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . endogenous septin <dig> and septin <dig>  which form a complex with septin <dig>  can be immunoprecipitated by an anti-borg <dig> antibody and expression of borg interferes with normal septin distribution. full-length myc-borg <dig> induces the formation of long and thick septin fibres and cdc <dig> negatively regulates this effect by inhibiting the binding of borg <dig> to septins. these data suggest that the formation of thick septin <dig> filaments and actin filaments we see upon expression of the dominant-negative cdc <dig> mutant is controlled by a regulatory mechanism, which modulates septin <dig> function directly and not only via regulating actin organisation.

in our experiments comparing truncated versions of septin <dig> in cells we could show that the gtpase domain of septin <dig> is sufficient to prevent the loss of actin bundles induced by expression of the polybasic region alone. the exact role of septin gtpase activity is still unclear  <cit> . using recombinant septins, sheffield and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that although pre-assembled septin6/septin7/septin2-filaments show only a slow gtpase activity, gtp-hydrolysis occurs during formation of heterodimers, a process before the assembling of filamentous complexes. microinjection of non-hydrolyzable gtp  in cells disrupted fibrous distribution of septin <dig> suggesting that the fibrous distribution of septin <dig> requires gtp-hydrolysis  <cit> . in contrast, there is no evidence that gtpase-activity is necessary for assembly of septin filaments in curved bundles and ring-like structures in vitro  <cit> . so far we do not know how septin <dig> interacts with actin bundling proteins and how it gets recruited to actin filaments in interphase cells. we do not know whether the reduction in actin expression levels induced by septin <dig> rnai is a cause or an effect of the observed loss of actin bundles. identification of binding partners for septin <dig> will be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the property of septin <dig> to stabilise actin bundles.

it has been shown in vitro that septin <dig> is capable of forming ring-like structures and spirals in an actin-independent fashion  <cit> . here, we provide in vivo characterisation of this intrinsic property of septin <dig>  moving cells and ruffling cells are the first cell systems described so far where the actin-independent distribution of septin <dig> in o- and c-shaped rings has been studied in a physiological context, without interfering with cell viability and function. these model systems allow us to draw two firm conclusions:  <dig>  that septin <dig> is not associated with actin in regions where highly dynamic actin is not organised in fibres and is being constantly remodeled, and indeed septin <dig> is actually efficiently excluded from these regions :  <dig>  that septin <dig> when not associated with actin forms rings and ring-like structures instead of filaments . this is in agreement with in vitro data obtained from recombinant septin complexes showing their tendency to self-assemble into rings and spirals  <cit> . in contrast, however, to these in vitro structures, which are highly stable, the in vivo assemblies are highly dynamic . bleaching experiments clearly showed the constant exchange of septin <dig> in and out of the assemblies as well as in and out of actin-dependent septin <dig> filaments. the function of actin-independent septin <dig> assemblies, however, is still elusive. since they seem to be freely localised in the cytosol and are not associated with membrane structures , they might represent storage containers of septin <dig>  the dynamic behaviour of septin <dig> explains how cells can adjust septin <dig> function to different needs. the identification of further proteins involved in this process  is necessary for molecular characterisation of the interplay between septin <dig> and actin.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide a link between the different morphological states of septin <dig> and functions of septin <dig> in actin-dynamics, and confirm the physiological relevance of the model proposed by kinoshita and colleagues  <cit> , that septin <dig> filaments play a role in stabilisation of actin stress fibres thus preventing actin turnover.
