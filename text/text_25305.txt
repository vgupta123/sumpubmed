BACKGROUND
cabbage  is one of the most important vegetable crops, and is consumed as a food worldwide due to its healthy compounds for humans. besides its economic importance, cabbage is considered a valuable plant for the study of genome evolution because it contains a cc genome, which represents one of three basic diploid brassica species in the u’s triangle  <cit> . recently, two draft genome sequences of b. oleracea were reported  <cit> , and the availability of this reference genome enhances our understanding of the genome architecture of b. oleracea and the evolution of brassica species, as well as facilitates identification of genes associated with important traits for breeding.

black rot is one of the most devastating diseases to crucifers including b. oleracea and is caused by the vascular bacterium xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris  dowson . the disease infects the host plants through hydathodes, wounded tissue, insects and stomata  <cit> . the main disease symptoms are v-shaped chlorotic lesions at the margins of leaves, necrosis and darkening of leaf veins, which lead to serious production losses in vegetable crops  <cit> . accordingly, development of cultivars resistant to black rot has been a priority for breeders.

several methods have been attempted to control black rot disease, including crop diversification and rotation, production of disease-free seed, pre-treatment of seed with bactericide, elimination of potential pathogen sources such as infected crop debris and weeds, and planting of resistant cultivars  <cit> . among these, utilization of resistant cultivars is one of the most effective and efficient ways to reduce disease incidence and crop loss. however, the development of commercially acceptable resistant varieties has proven to be extremely difficult due to the lack of studies on genetics and breeding for resistance in cabbage. two major factors hinder black rot resistance breeding in b. oleracea: multigenic control of resistance and emergence of new races of the pathogen that overcome host resistance  <cit> . nine races of xcc have been identified  <cit> , among which races  <dig> and  <dig> are the major pathogens causing black rot disease in b. oleracea crops  <cit> . therefore, obtaining b. oleracea cultivars that have resistance to both races is considered a prerequisite to control black rot disease  <cit> .

molecular markers are highly useful for genomic analysis and allow exploration of heritable traits and the corresponding genomic variation  <cit> . dna markers are now key components of crop improvement programs, and are applied to identify cultivars, analyze genetic diversity, construct linkage maps and identify quantitative trait loci   <cit> . advances in molecular markers have facilitated the identification of interesting traits via marker-assisted selection  in plant improvement. marker-based approaches represent an effective and rapid strategy for identifying and transferring useful genes in breeding programs  <cit> . furthermore, the identification of markers linked to qtl can allow analysis of the consistency of qtl effects across different environments and genetic backgrounds, and increase the frequency of favorable alleles during selection  <cit> . several qtls for black rot resistance in b. oleracea have been reported, including two on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  and two additional qtls on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> , as well as two other major qtls on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  and two minor qtls on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, three qtls analyzed using snp markers in the f <dig> mapping population derived from a cross between resistant cabbage and susceptible broccoli were found on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and exhibited significant effects in black rot resistance  <cit> . recently, three further qtls for black rot resistance were also detected in linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in total,  <dig> qtls with major and minor effects have been mapped on eight different b. oleracea chromosomes, suggesting that resistance to black rot disease is complex and quantitatively controlled by multiple genes in b. oleracea.

successful qtl mapping requires a large number of genetic markers  <cit> . markers based on simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  are commonly used due to their advantages over other types of genetic markers. ssr markers are highly reproducible, highly polymorphic, and amenable to automation. however, next-generation sequencing  technology makes snp markers preferable to ssr markers  <cit> . snps have proved to be universal as well as the most abundant forms of genetic variation even among individuals of the same species  <cit> . therefore, snp markers exhibit higher polymorphism than ssr markers  <cit> .

in this study, we have resequenced two parental cabbage lines up to 20× genome coverage and conducted a genome-wide survey for snps. we validated the snps and developed derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences  markers for resistance against black rot disease. the genome-wide catalog of snps, the high-density map derived from a mapping population generated from elite cabbage breeding lines with a narrow genetic background, and the qtls reported herein all will be valuable for both breeding and genetic research in b. oleracea.

RESULTS
whole-genome resequencing of two cabbage parental lines and snp detection
whole genome sequencing data included about  <dig> million raw reads for c <dig> and  <dig> million for c <dig> . the recently assembled b. oleracea genome sequence consists of  <dig>  mb, including  <dig>  mb in  <dig> pseudo-chromosomes and  <dig>  mb of unanchored scaffolds, and corresponding to almost 75% of the estimated genome size   <cit> . our new sequencing data represented approximately 18-fold genome coverage for both parental lines based on the estimated genome size. we mapped each set of paired reads onto the nine pseudo-chromosomes of reference genome sequence. in total, almost  <dig> million raw reads  and  <dig> million  from c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, were successfully aligned to the reference genome. the average mapping depth was  <dig> - and 20-fold for c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively.table  <dig>

the total number of snps relative to the reference sequence and average snp densities were very similar in both parental lines. approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  million high-quality snps are identified in c <dig> and c <dig>  respectively, by comparison to the reference genome. on average, a snp was detected in each  <dig>  bp in c <dig>  and each  <dig>  bp in c <dig>  chromosome c <dig> of both lines had the most snps, whereas the fewest snps were found on chromosome c <dig> of c <dig> and chromosome c <dig> of c <dig> 

these snps were merged and used to detect snps between the two parental lines . as a result, a total of  <dig>  snps were found throughout nine chromosomes, with an average of  <dig> snp per  <dig> -bp interval. the highest density of snps was found on chromosome c <dig>  with a snp per 541 bp, while the lowest density was on chromosome c <dig>  with one snp per  <dig>  bp. analysis of the distribution of snps per 100 kb along the nine chromosomes revealed areas of high and low snp density on each chromosome .table  <dig>

development of dcaps markers and construction of genetic map
we used the snps between c <dig> and c <dig> for development of dcaps markers. based on the physical positions of all markers used in a previous genetic map for b. oleracea  <cit> , new dcaps markers were designed for the regions of low marker density. among  <dig> markers amplified,  <dig>  were polymorphic between the two parental lines . among the  <dig> polymorphic markers,  <dig> showed heterozygosity in one of parental lines . we used  <dig> of these polymorphic dcaps markers for genotyping of each individual in the f <dig> population . additionally,  <dig> other types of polymorphic markers including five est-based dcaps markers, five mip markers, three ibp markers, two genomic ssr markers, and one indel marker were also genotyped with the same population. among  <dig> newly analyzed markers,  <dig> markers showed a segregation pattern distorted from the 1:2: <dig> mendelian ratio in the f <dig> population, based on chi-square goodness of fit at the  <dig>  probability level . there were six segregation distortion regions  in the previous map  <cit> , and all dcaps markers designed from the sdrs of c <dig> and c <dig> showed the same distortion ratio.

the  <dig> novel polymorphic marker loci  were added to the previous  <dig> markers  <cit>  to develop a higher density genetic map. all  <dig> markers were placed on the map, and a linkage map was generated with nine linkage groups  in which each lg had more than  <dig> markers . the improved b. oleracea genetic map spanned  <dig> .3 cm, which is  <dig>  cm more than the previous map, and the average distance between neighboring loci was reduced to  <dig>  from  <dig>  cm. most of the new dcaps markers were mapped to the originally estimated position of each chromosome sequence. the exceptions included borsdcaps1- <dig>  which was designed on chromosome c <dig> but mapped to chromosome c <dig>  and borsdcaps5- <dig>  designed on chromosome c <dig> but mapped to chromosome c <dig> figure  <dig>

black rot resistance assays and qtl analysis
we performed three independent inoculation trials over three years. the final disease index for f <dig> plants was determined by calculating the average value of the black rot disease indices for 10 ~ 15 f2: <dig> progeny plants for each trial. although all three inoculation tests were performed under the same conditions, the disease symptoms for each test were not consistent and tended to become more severe in later years , possibly due to differences in plant growth or storage term for the f <dig> seeds or to weather differences between years.

qtl analyses were performed for each of three trials. we detected significant qtls, based on higher lod scores than the thresholds calculated in the permutation tests; lod threshold values for the tests in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. in the first test performed in  <dig>  there were three significant qtl regions: brqtl-c1_ <dig> and brqtl-c1_ <dig> on chromosome c <dig>  and brqtl-c <dig> on chromosome c <dig> . among these, brqtl-c1_ <dig> had the highest lod score, additive effect, and variance explained . the second test identified only a single qtl, which was included within brqtl-c1_ <dig> detected in the  <dig> test, although this qtl had smallest lod score among all qtls identified in the three tests. the last test, carried out in  <dig>  identified brqtl-c1_ <dig> and  <dig> as well as a novel qtl in chromosome  <dig>  brqtl-c <dig>  brqtl-c1_ <dig> in the  <dig> test was identified as a smaller region than in  <dig>  but had the highest lod score among all qtls and accounted for  <dig> % of the variation.table  <dig>

nbs-encoding genes in qtl regions
in most plants, disease resistance-related genes  encode proteins containing nucleotide binding sites  and a series of leucine-rich repeats , termed nbs-lrr proteins. nbs-lrr proteins recognize and correspond to pathogen avirulence factors, and lead to defense responses and hypersensitive reactions  <cit> . hence, we compared our genetic map to the pseudo-chromosome sequences  <cit>  and searched for nbs-lrr genes within the qtl regions . brqtl-c1_ <dig> was found between markers h073e22- <dig> and borsdcaps1- <dig>  and brqtl-c1_ <dig> was between borsdcaps1- <dig> and boedcaps <dig> . we identified eight nbs-lrr-encoding genes between h073e22- <dig> and boedcaps <dig> showing brqtl-c1_ <dig> and brqtl-c1_ <dig> qtls. seven nbs-lrr type r genes were detected within 1 mb of the boessr <dig> marker, which is located near the brqtl-c <dig> region. brqtl-c <dig> contained five nbs-lrr type r genes.table  <dig>

we compared the sequences of these  <dig> candidate r genes against the brassica database   <cit> . all  <dig> sequences showed similarity to disease resistance proteins, of which  <dig> and  <dig> sequences had syntenic genes in b. rapa and a. thaliana, respectively. according to the gene annotation, two candidate disease resistance genes  in brqtl-c <dig>  and seven genes in brqtl-c <dig> were found as gene clusters .

seven of nine nbs-lrr genes in brqtl-c <dig> were syntenic with the r genes in the counterpart regions of chromosome a <dig> in b. rapa . orthologous genes of two nbs-lrr genes, bo1g <dig> and bo1g <dig>  located within a 63-kb portion of brqtl-c <dig> appeared as tandem array at the counterpart syntenic region in b. rapa and a. thaliana . all nbs-lrr genes in brqtl-c <dig> also showed highly conserved syntenic relationships with counterpart regions in b. rapa and a. thaliana. however, a 72-kb region near brqtl-c <dig> contained a cluster of seven nbs-lrr genes, whereas the syntenic region in b. rapa contained a cluster of only three such genes, and the corresponding syntenic region in a. thaliana did not have any r genes .figure  <dig>

discussion
frequency and utility of snps revealed by whole-genome resequencing
an appropriate reference sequence allows whole-genome sequence data from individuals to be aligned, and thus resequencing can be used to detect genetic variation between different samples as high-confidence sequence differences  <cit> . accordingly, we performed whole-genome resequencing for two cabbage lines to detect genome-wide snps for marker development to construct a high-density genetic map. there are two available draft genome sequences for b. oleracea; although the total assembled sequence of liu et al.   <cit>  is larger than that of parkin et al.   <cit> , the size of the nine pseudo-chromosomes of the latter  is larger than that of the former . therefore, we chose the genome sequence of parkin et al.  <cit>  as a reference for this research because of its advantage for sequence-guided snp marker development.

approximately 80% of our newly generated pe sequence reads were successfully aligned to the reference genome. almost  <dig>  million snps were found in both lines compared to the reference, and  <dig>  snps were found between c <dig> and c <dig>  the number and density of snps between both parental lines were much lower than those detected by comparison with the reference. this could be related to the fact that the plant material used for the reference genome sequencing was kale-like b. oleracea  <cit> , whereas the two parental lines used in this work were typical cabbages. in addition, we detected fewer snps between these lines than the  <dig>  million snps  previously reported between two other cabbages  <cit> . our plant materials have been used as elite breeding resources by a korean company, and thus the genetic relationship between these two parental inbred lines is likely much closer than to the reference accession or the relationship between the two cabbages used by liu et al.  <cit> ; this close relationship likely underlies the relatively low number of snps we identified.

among  <dig> dcaps markers that successfully produced pcr products,  <dig> % showed polymorphism. this rate was much higher than that of est-derived dcaps markers, in which the polymorphic rate was  <dig> % when evaluated with low-sequencing depth  <dig> rna-seq reads  <cit> . paired-end read data generated by illumina sequencing could allow more accurate alignment of raw reads compared to single reads from  <dig> rna-seq, and thus the snp calling process would also become more precise. the  <dig> % of dcaps markers showing no polymorphism might reflect false mapping of reads to paralogous regions, as there is high sequence similarity between the triplicated genomes and among recently duplicated chromosome segments  <cit> . this could also be the reason two dcaps markers, borsdcaps1- <dig> and borsdcaps5- <dig>  were mapped to unexpected chromosomes.

collectively, our results demonstrate that whole-genome resequencing data generated by ngs techniques can be highly useful for large-scale discovery of snps and development of snp-based molecular markers. further study will enable high-throughput genotyping with snps detected here.

improvement of the genetic map between cabbage breeding lines
by obtaining large numbers of reliable snps and utilizing them for development of dna markers, we were able to improve the genetic map of cabbage. the genetic map now spans a total  <dig> .3 cm after our addition of snp markers developed for the relatively large gaps  in the previous map  <cit> . consequently, the  <dig> gaps in the previous genetic map are now reduced to  <dig> gaps and the average interval is smaller than before. the  <dig> markers used for the improved genetic map are promising for general cabbage breeding purposes because the map was built using a mapping population between two elite breeding lines with narrow genetic diversity. by contrast, most of previous genetic map was built using mapping populations derived between lines with wide genetic diversity for academic purposes, for example a cross between double-haploid  lines derived from other subspecies  <cit>  or dh lines selected based on simple morphological differences  <cit> . therefore, the genetic map in this study will be helpful for molecular breeding associated not only with black rot resistance but also with many other important agricultural traits.

qtl mapping of black rot resistance
we identified four qtl regions that could contribute additively to resistance. the brqtl-c1_ <dig> qtl region was detected repeatedly in the three independent inoculation tests, had the highest lod values and also accounted for the highest percentage of the variation in all tests. accordingly, brqtl-c1_ <dig> is a strong candidate to be a major qtl for black rot resistance. brqtl-c1_ <dig>  brqtl-c <dig>  and brqtl-c <dig> seem to be minor qtls, which could be influenced by plant conditions and environmental factors. although two qtls identified in chromosome c <dig> included sdrs, we retained all distorted markers for qtl analysis because distorted markers can also be helpful for qtl mapping when they are addressed properly  <cit> .

the positions of our black rot resistance qtls did not coincide with those of the  <dig> previously reported qtls  <cit> . this lack of overlap is probably due to differences in disease resistance sources or inocula used. some studies did not describe the races used  <cit> , while some  <cit>  used xcc race  <dig>  the exact race used in this study has not been classified yet. integrated and standardized protocols for black rot disease races and testing would facilitate further research. however, even though the same xcc race was used in our three inoculation tests, disease indices for same f <dig> lineages were not consistent year to year and thus different qtls were detected between tests. resistance to xcc has been reported to vary depending on accessions of b. oleracea and pathogen races  <cit> . further, the resistance is likely also affected by complex polygenic control under different environmental conditions. regardless of the race used , the different qtls detected here should represent new regions.

candidate genes for black rot resistance
the genomes of b. oleracea, b. rapa, and a. thaliana share a set of  <dig> conserved syntenic blocks, a to x, that can be identified among the ancestral karyotype  <cit> . the complete b. oleracea draft genome also demonstrates generally strong conservation with b. rapa in large segments at the pseudo-molecule level  <cit> . comparative analysis revealed the presence of conserved r gene orthologs at the syntenic counterparts in b. oleracea, b. rapa and a. thaliana. in particular, the brqtl-c <dig> region of c <dig> in b. oleracea showed large-scale conservation with a <dig> in b. rapa. our analysis demonstrated that bra <dig>  found in unanchored scaffold <dig> of the b. rapa genome, is an ortholog of bo1g <dig> in b. oleracea . based on our finding that at1g <dig>  the corresponding orthologous gene in a. thaliana, was also located in a syntenic region, the unanchored b. rapa scaffold <dig> is likely derived from chromosome a <dig> 

in plant genomes, hundreds of nbs-lrr genes are distributed as single genes or in tandem arrays as gene clusters, which arise from tandem gene duplications or homologous recombination and homogenization  <cit> . we detected  <dig> r genes in the four qtl regions, of which  <dig> were in gene clusters . most of the r genes showed conserved syntenic relationships in brassica and arabidopsis . however, near brqtl-c <dig> were nbs-lrr gene clusters that appear to be unique to the brassica lineage . this result implied that three-r-gene clusters arose by insertion in the brassica lineage at bra <dig> and subsequently amplified to a seven-r-gene cluster in b. oleracea over the  <dig>  million years after divergence of the brassica species  <cit> .

although genomes of brassica-lineage species underwent whole-genome triplication events, the number of resistance genes was not proportionally increased in the brassica genome  <cit> . around 150 ~  <dig> r genes were reported in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> , and  <dig>  <cit>  ~  <dig>  and  <dig> genes  <cit>  were annotated as r genes in b. rapa and b. oleracea genomes, respectively. the  <dig> nbs-lrr genes found in the four qtl regions are proportionally higher density compared to other chromosomal regions, supporting the idea that some of these nbs-lrrs could be candidate to control black rot resistance in b. oleracea. further analysis to reveal the function of these genes will be necessary for identification of the major resistance genes for xcc.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed whole-genome resequencing of two cabbage inbred lines that are parental lines for black rot disease resistance and breeding lines with elite agricultural traits. based on genome-wide snp detection and validation with dcaps markers, we report  <dig>  snps with 70% accuracy between the parental lines. by combining snp-based markers into the previous genetic map, we improved the genetic map and identified four qtl regions that contained  <dig> candidate r genes. we thus demonstrated that whole-genome resequencing can successfully be applied for detection of large-scale snps, development of molecular markers, and ultimately construction of a high-density genetic map for qtl analysis and marker-assisted breeding of b. oleracea.
