BACKGROUND
flowering time is an important plant breeding target . the time at which flowering occurs affects the ensuing success of flower, seed and fruit development, ease of harvest and marketing. in addition, since flowering of vegetative crops and forages can be negatively correlated with yield and nutritive quality, the ability to delay flowering in such plants would be advantageous. therefore, our goal is to develop molecular-genetic tools for customization of flowering in economically-important plants.

plants use a combination of environmental and developmental cues to trigger flowering. the genetic networks that are involved in perception and response to these floral signals is best worked out in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> . many of the flowering time pathways ultimately converge on a set of genes called floral integrators, which includes flowering locus t  and a closely related and partially redundant homologue twin sister of ft   <cit> . ft strongly activates flowering in arabidopsis and mutants lacking a functional ft gene flower very late, while transgenic plants over expressing ft flower much earlier than wild type plants  <cit> .

ft is the primary target of several flowering time pathways. these include the long day pathway which promotes flowering in response to long day photoperiods via constans  mediated up regulation of ft, and the vernalisation and autonomous pathways that function to down regulate the flowering repressor flowering locus c  thereby alleviating flc's repression of ft . ft transcript is expressed in the leaf vasculature where ft protein is produced and moves via the phloem to the shoot tip  <cit> . in the shoot apical meristem, ft partners with fd, a bzip transcription factor and switches on genes, such as apetala <dig>  to initiate floral development  <cit> . thus, ft protein functions as an important component of the mobile flowering hormone, florigen .

older physiological studies demonstrated the universal nature of florigen in plants . consistent with this, orthologues of the arabidopsis ft gene are widespread in the plant kingdom  and promote flowering even in plants with different day length requirements to arabidopsis. for example, the tomato ft orthologue single flower truss  promotes flowering in day neutral tomato  <cit>  and two rice ft orthologues, heading date 3a  and rice flowering locus t  <dig>  promote flowering in rice, a short-day plant  <cit> . like arabidopsis ft, the sft, hd3a and rft <dig> genes encode a graft transmissible floral signal  <cit> . in addition, over expression of ft orthologues such as sft can promote flowering in heterologous transgenic plants  <cit> . thus, despite differences in the upstream signaling pathways in different plants, the induction of ft expression in leaves and its movement to the apex where it triggers flowering appears to be conserved.

genetic engineering of flowering time in many cultivated species has been achieved by manipulation of floral repressors or floral promoters, including the over expression or inducible expression of ft to accelerate flowering in transgenic plants  <cit> . because of the conservation of ft function across the plant kingdom, we have focused on developing a controlled-inducible flowering system that manipulates endogenous and heterologous ft genes. this utilizes the induction of a heterologous ft gene to trigger flowering in a background in which flowering has been inhibited using an artifical microrna that targets the endogenous ft gene. the system is based on the idea that artificial micrornas can be designed to specifically down regulate an endogenous gene, but should not affect the expression of a sufficiently divergent functional orthologue from another species. here, we report on the development of this system for inducing flowering on demand and demonstrate its utility in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
selecting a heterologous ft gene to overcome the late flowering phenotype of amir-ft arabidopsis plants
our starting point was a late flowering transgenic line of arabidopsis in which flowering was inhibited by the expression of an artificial micro rna directed against the ft gene  in the phloem companion cells  <cit> . this amir-ft pairs with ft transcript in the companion cells of the phloem and stimulates its degradation leading to gene silencing  <cit> . the amir-ft sequence is complementary to bases  <dig> to  <dig> of the ft coding sequence  .

to overcome the late flowering phenotype of the amir-ft plants, an ft orthologue was needed that would not be targeted by the amir-ft, but could function to promote flowering in arabidopsis. since, in a related project we are investigating the role of ft genes in flowering regulation in the model legume medicago truncatula , we investigated whether a medicago ft gene might be a suitable heterologous candidate. there are five ft genes in medicago; the partial genomic dna sequences of three ft genes  were described previously  <cit> , while our database mining revealed full length sequences for these genes and two more, ftb <dig> and ftb <dig> . fta <dig> is predicted to be the most closely related protein to ft with 71% identity. fta <dig>  ftb <dig> and ftb <dig> share at least 64% identity with ft, while ftc is slightly less similar at  <dig> % identity to ft. two key residues that are important for ft function in arabidopsis  <cit>  are present in four of the predicted medicago ft proteins  . the fifth predicted protein, ftc, has the conserved tyrosine residue, but the conserved glutamine in ft is replaced by a histidine .

phylogenetic analysis of ft and the related terminal flower <dig> proteins, that repress flowering, shows that fta <dig> and fta <dig> form a sister clade to ft/tsf) . however, although fta <dig> shares the highest identity with arabidopsis ft, all of the ft proteins are as closely related to ft as the known functional ft orthologues, hd3a and rft <dig> from rice  <cit>  and sft from tomato  <cit> .

to test if the medicago fta <dig> gene was likely to be targeted by the amir-ft, it was aligned with the amir-ft sequence. no significant similarity was identified using blast nucleotide searches. the best alignment that could be made using the multalin program is shown in figure 1c. the number of mismatches in this alignment is  <dig> over the  <dig> base sequence, with  <dig> of these in the 5' region , which are important for efficient target-transcript down regulation  <cit> . this indicated that the fta <dig> transcript was unlikely to pair with the amir-ft and be degraded.

overexpression of fta <dig> rescues the late flowering phenotype of amir-ft transgenic plants
our first aim was to over express fta <dig> in the amir-ft plants to test if this would rescue the late flowering phenotype. an expression construct with fta <dig> fused to the 35s promoter  was generated. transformed t <dig> plants were selected, grown in flowering-inductive long day conditions  and their flowering time scored .

analysis of the leaf number at flowering showed that the majority of the 35s::fta <dig> t <dig> plants  flowered considerably earlier than amir-ft plants and wild type control plants, columbia  . this result shows that over expression of fta <dig> promotes flowering in arabidopsis and fully rescues the late flowering phenotype of amir-ft transgenic plants. thus, fta <dig> functions to promote flowering in arabidopsis, but does not appear to be targeted by the amir-ft.

before constructing an inducible version of fta <dig>  we confirmed that the early flowering phenotype observed in the t <dig> generation plants was heritable and expressed in their progeny. two independent, homozygous t <dig> transgenic lines with single locus insertions were selected. the t <dig> transgenic lines were grown in ld or short day  conditions. the t <dig> lines flowered much more rapidly than the control amir-ft plants in both conditions . these results confirmed that the early flowering trait was heritable. in addition, they showed that 35s::fta <dig> also promoted flowering in non-inductive sd conditions in which flowering of the control col plants are delayed .

expression of the fta <dig> transgene and endogenous ft in the t <dig> lines and control plants in ld was measured by qrt-pcr . since arabidopsis ft has cyclical diurnal expression, we harvested tissue  <dig> h after dawn when ft levels are rising in wild type plants grown in ld conditions  <cit> . as expected, in the presence of the amir-ft, ft levels were lower in both fta <dig> transgenic lines and the amirna-ft line as compared to col plants . in contrast, the fta <dig> transcripts were detected at high levels in the 35s::fta <dig> lines . this result confirmed that the fta <dig> transgene was abundantly expressed in the t <dig> generation plants and this was consistent with their early flowering phenotype.

ethanol induces synchronous flowering in amir-ft plants with an alc::fta <dig> construct
since expression of fta <dig> from the 35s promoter rescued the late flowering phenotype of the amirna-ft lines, we generated an alcohol-inducible version of fta <dig>   <cit> . amir-ft arabidopsis transgenic plants were transformed with the alc::fta <dig> gene expression construct and  <dig> t <dig> transformants were selected. the t <dig> seed from these alc::fta <dig> lines were sown out in ld and exposed to ethanol vapour. eighteen of these t <dig> families segregated plants that flowered at  <dig> leaves or less  which is much earlier than the amirna-ft control plants . this result suggested that flowering in these lines was inducible by ethanol treatment.

to confirm this result, four independent homozygous alc::fta <dig> t <dig> lines  with single copy insertions were selected. plants grown in ld were exposed to dual ethanol vapour treatments in which <dig> day-old seedlings were treated with ethanol for  <dig> h and then exposed for a second time at day  <dig> for  <dig> h and their flowering time recorded . three of the tg lines  showed strong induction of flowering compared to tg plants grown in the absence of ethanol. analysis of leaf number at flowering  shows that the tg plants flowered as early or earlier  than wild type col plants . one other line  showed a much weaker flowering promotion in response to ethanol  compared to the -etoh treatment . in the absence of ethanol, the tg lines all flowered late  and at a similar time to the amir-ft line . there was no effect of ethanol on flowering of control col or amir-ft plants.

the ability of ethanol to induce alc::fta <dig> expression was examined using qrt-pcr . three out of the four tg lines  showed good induction of fta <dig> expression after exposure to  <dig> h ethanol while one  showed very little induction . the very low fta <dig> induction in tg <dig> correlated with the delayed flowering in this line . however, while tg <dig>  tg <dig> and tg <dig> plants flowered at about the same time after induction, the level of fta <dig> expression was very different. thus there was an absence of direct correlation between the level of fta <dig> induction and flowering in the rapid flowering lines. in the untreated tg lines, fta <dig> was expressed at much lower levels , but was detectable by qrt-pcr. however, clearly this was not at sufficient levels to overcome the late flowering phenotype conferred by amir-ft. as expected, ethanol treatment did not alter endogenous ft accumulation which was expressed at lower levels in the transgenic lines than wild type col .

in order to investigate the kinetics of fta <dig> transcript accumulation, we carried out an induction time course. fta <dig> expression in tg <dig> plants in ld in response to ethanol vapour over  <dig> h was determined . levels of fta <dig> rose strongly within the first  <dig> h of ethanol exposure and continued to rise over the next  <dig> h. no change in expression was observed in the untreated tg <dig> plants over the same time course. this rapid response to ethanol is consistent with previous reports of ethanol induction of alc:: reporter gene constructs  <cit> .

these results indicated that ethanol vapour treatments were sufficient to induce fta <dig> expression and synchronous early flowering and thus rescue the late flowering phenotype of the amir-ft plants carrying the alc::fta <dig> construct. in addition, the alc::fta <dig> system gave tight control of the transition to flowering as the transgenic plants flowered late in the absence of ethanol.

manipulation of the timing of flowering
next we tested if the timing of flowering could be manipulated on demand by applying ethanol to plants of different ages. tg <dig> plants were grown in ld conditions and groups of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> day-old plants were exposed to a single  <dig> h ethanol vapour treatment. we also repeated the dual ethanol treatment of 10-day- old plants as described above. in addition, we tested if flowering could be induced in sd conditions by exposure to ethanol. the number of days to flowering after the onset of each ethanol treatment was recorded for each plant .

in ld conditions, all ethanol treatments resulted in induction of flowering in the majority of plants . floral buds were first seen on the earliest-flowering plants  <dig> days after the onset of all the ethanol treatments. thus these plants flowered  <dig> days,  <dig> days or  <dig> days after sowing. a control group of tg <dig> plants that were not exposed to ethanol were grown in parallel. the first of these plants  started to flower  <dig> days after sowing in ld. thus the alc::fta <dig> plants could be induced to flower as early or earlier than wild type col plants  or later than wild type, by varying the time at which ethanol is applied.

in ld, all of the  <dig> and  <dig> day-old-plants were induced to flower more rapidly than the untreated tg <dig> plants by a single exposure to ethanol . however, the response of the 10-day-old plants to the single ethanol exposure was weaker . while  <dig> of these plants were induced to flower by ethanol, the two remaining plants were not. one of these plants flowered  <dig> days after the start of the treatment , while the other still had not flowered by  <dig> days after the start of treatment . this was similar to the untreated tg <dig> controls.

the most effective of all the treatments in ld was the dual ethanol treatment of the 10-day-old tg <dig> plants in ld. this resulted in the most synchronous early flowering . this indicated that there might be the need for more sustained expression of fta <dig>  particularly in younger plants in ld. this may be similar to wild type arabidopsis plants, where endogenous ft is up-regulated by exposing sd-grown plants to a single ld, but three lds are required for commitment to flowering  <cit> . in addition, repeated induction of a heat-shock responsive ft transgene was most effective at promoting the transition to flowering and ensuing normal flower development in transgenic poplar  <cit> .

flowering was also able to be induced in the majority of tg <dig> plants by ethanol in sd conditions . twenty day-old sd-grown plants were treated with ethanol for  <dig> h followed by a  <dig> h treatment  <dig> days later. flower buds were seen  <dig> days after the onset of ethanol treatment on the earliest flowering plants . in ld, the earliest flowering plants also flowered  <dig> days after the initiation of ethanol treatment . however, not all of the sd plants were induced to flower before the untreated tg <dig> plants. the latter began to flower from  <dig> days after sowing . seventeen ethanol-treated tg <dig> plants had flowered before the untreated tg <dig> controls began to flower, while seven had not . this indicates that in sd there may be a need for more sustained induction of fta <dig> or treatment of older plants to obtain floral induction in 100% of plants.

as controls for the induction experiment in sd, we also included ethanol- treated col and amir-ft plants. none of these plants had flowered by  <dig> days after sowing, at which time the experiment was halted. in addition, we grew a control alcohol-inducible transgenic line, the alc::gus transgenic line  <cit> . this gene expression construct allows for ethanol-inducible expression of the β-glucuronidase  reporter gene. none of the alc::gus plants, whether ethanol treated or untreated, had flowered by  <dig> days after sowing. thus the early flowering phenotype of the tg <dig> plants in sd is due to ethanol induction of the alc::fta <dig> gene-expression cassette.

CONCLUSIONS
flowering time is a key trait in the breeding of crop and ornamental plants. our aim was to create a universally-applicable floral induction system that will allow flowering to be induced on demand. here, we have described such a system and demonstrated its utility in the model plant arabidopsis.

we showed that the expression of an ft orthologue from medicago truncatula, fta <dig>  can overcome the delayed flowering of a transgenic arabidopsis plants caused by expression of an artificial microrna to the arabidopsis ft gene, amir-ft. tight, inducible control of floral induction was engineered successfully using an alcohol-inducible version of the fta <dig> gene. the timing of flowering could be manipulated by applying ethanol to plants of different ages, to give plants that flowered earlier or later than wild type. endogenous arabidopsis ft remained low in the transgenic lines, consistent with ongoing silencing by the amir-ft. this indicates that the medicago fta <dig> is sufficiently different from arabidopsis ft to escape being targeted by the amir-ft, yet has the ability to strongly promote flowering.

the advantage of the ft- based approach tested here in arabidopsis is that because of the likely universal role of ft in triggering of flowering, it should work in other plants. inducing flowering when desired has many commercial uses  <cit> . for example, one application of our strategy might be to delay flowering in forage grasses during grazing to give consistent nutritive value and yield, but then later induce synchronous flowering for seed production. other applications in crops could include inhibiting flowering, followed by inducing flowering to coincide with important market dates, or to avoid peak summer temperatures. the use of the alc inducible system should allow the system to be used in a field setting . thus, our system has all the attributes required of a biotechnological floral induction system.

although we have demonstrated the ability to overcome an artificial microrna that targets a single ft gene, in some cultivated species it might be important to down regulate multiple ft genes to more effectively delay flowering. for example, arabidopsis ft has the closely-related paralogue tsf and double ft tsf mutants flower much later than the single mutants  <cit> . in rice, two key ft genes have an even stronger impact on flowering as plants with rnai silencing of both genes had not flowered by  <dig> days after sowing  <cit> . mathieu et al.  demonstrated that it was possible to design an artificial microrna that could target both the arabidopsis ft and tsf mrna simultaneously. plants overexpressing this amir construct phenocopied the late flowering of the ft tsf double mutant. therefore, the use of one or more artifical micrornas should allow all the ft family members involved in the induction of flowering of a particular species to be targeted. care would then need to be taken to select an ft orthologue from another species that would be unaffected by the amir.

in some cultivated species, natural variants exist that have strongly delayed flowering  <cit> . in most cases, the genetic reason for the delayed flowering has not been determined. however, it is likely that often this is caused by alterations to pathways upstream of ft that prevent or delay the induction of ft. thus, it is an attractive possibility that the late flowering of many natural variants could be utilized in our inducible flowering system so that the targeting of the endogenous ft genes using amir would not be necessary and that flowering could be induced simply by using the alcohol-inducible ft gene.

in summary, we present proof-of-principle experiments that demonstrate a novel system for inducing flowering on demand, which should provide a biotechnological method for the customization of flowering of commercially important plants.
