BACKGROUND
current microarray technologies conduct simultaneous studies of gene expression data of thousands of genes under different conditions. in most of these studies, expression data are analyzed using various standard statistical methods to identify a list of genes responsible for a particular condition. however, in these approaches, interplay among genes is not taken into account. since organisms behave as complex systems, functioning through chemical networks and interaction of various molecules , this interplay of genes may provide invaluable insight to the understanding of various diseases. thus, along with the efforts to identify the individual genes that play vital roles in a particular disease, there is a growing interest in identifying the roles of different pathways in such diseases.

biological pathway is a group of related genes coding for proteins that interact with each other to perform some biological processes. according to the biological processes they are involved with, pathways can be divided into several categories, such as metabolic pathways and regulatory pathways. metabolic pathways are series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell, catalyzed by enzymes, resulting in either the formation of a metabolic product to be used or stored by the cell, or the initiation of another metabolic pathway. regulatory pathways represent protein-protein interactions.

during the past few years, many signaling and metabolic pathways have been discovered experimentally and have been integrated into pathway databases, such as kegg  <cit>  and biocarta  <cit> . various statistical techniques have been developed to analyze microarray expression data for the relevance of predefined pathways to a particular disease. these techniques include gene set enrichment analysis  <cit> , pathway level analysis of gene expression using singular value decomposition by tomfohr et al.  <cit> , and hypothesis testing  <cit>  by tian et al. these approaches are reviewed in detail in the related works section.

generally speaking, these approaches can be divided into two categories:

• conduct statistical differential analysis at the individual gene level, and integrate the result statistics of the genes in the same pathway;

• obtain activity level indices of each pathway for different sample groups and conduct differential analysis of these indices.

for the first category, when the statistics at individual gene level miss significant genes, the effectiveness of the pathway analysis will be affected. an example is given in the later part of this section. for the second approach, extracting pathway activity level indices from gene expression data may cause loss of information.

diabetes is a group of diseases characterized by high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. it is one of the most common diseases, affecting  <dig>  million people in the united states, or  <dig> % of the population  <cit> . hence, identifying active pathways in diabetes is a critical task for understanding this disease. several pathway analysis works have been proposed in this area  <cit> .

in gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> , a differential statistic is calculated first for each gene from their expression data of two different groups of samples. then the genes are ordered according to the statistic values. a running sum of weights is calculated from the ordered list for a particular pathway. the maximum value of this running sum is called the enrichment score of that pathway. to measure the significance of this score, a null distribution of enrichment scores is generated by permuting the sample labels. this approach falls into the first category stated previously, i.e., statistical analysis at individual gene level is performed followed by an integration of these statistics of genes in the same pathway.

in  <cit> , a hypothesis testing framework for pathway differential analysis is proposed. t-test and wilcoxon rank test are recommended to measure the difference of expressions of a single gene between two groups of samples. then this statistic is accumulated over each gene in a particular pathway and standardized by the total number of genes in this pathway. the significance of the result is then interpreted by rejecting two null hypotheses, each with a null population generated by permuting sample labels or gene indices. this approach also belongs to the first category above. statistical analysis at individual gene level is still required for the pathway analysis in this approach.

in  <cit> , singular value decomposition is used to obtain pathway activity levels from the gene expression matrix. t-test is applied to the pathway activity levels of the two different sample groups to measure the difference. significance of the measurement is also obtained by permuting the sample labels. in this approach, no differential analysis at individual gene level is required. however, an extraction of pathway activity level prior to the differential analysis is required. during this extraction process, since only the first eigenvector of singular value decomposition is used, some information of expressions is lost. this approach belongs to the second category stated above.

as discussed above, either t-test or rank sum test is used as a core step by  <cit>  to identify individual genes which are expressed differently from two different sample groups. thus these methods inevitably inherit the disadvantage of t-test and rank sum test. while the t-test is very sensitive to extreme values and cannot distinguish two sets with close means even though the two sets are significantly different from each others, the rank sum test is not sensitive to absolute values. in turn, those pathways contain genes which can not be identified by t-test or rank sum test but actually are significantly differently expressed in two different sample groups will be affected. for example, as showed in table  <dig>  the expressions of gene  <dig> are significantly different under two conditions. however this gene was not identified by t-test. thus, a pathway involving this gene is less likely to be identified by the first category of analysis that uses t-test at the gene level.

in this paper, we propose an innovative fuzzy-set-theory-based approach for differential analysis of gene pathways and apply it on identifying significant pathways for diabetes. in our proposed mcm-test, instead of identifying individual genes first, the differential analysis is done directly at the pathway level without individual gene differential statistic. all expression values of genes which belong to a pathway of a particular patient are treated as a vector. the intuition behind this is based on the fact that genes for each patient interplay with each other. mcm-test does not extract activity level of pathways either. this allows keeping the maximum amount of information for the pathway differential analysis. moreover, the fuzzy concept makes the approach more tolerant to individual data item noise.

RESULTS
to investigate our approach, we conducted experiments on both synthetic data and real world data. we first conducted a series of experiments on synthetic datasets to find the characteristics of mcm d-value. we then used the mcm-test on the real world diabetes dataset analyzed by tomfohr et al.  <cit>  and gsea  <cit> . results on real world diabetes data identified several pathways that were deregulated in diabetes patients. the top three pathways identified were related to mitochondrial functions in accordance with previous diabetes studies. mitochondrial dysfunction is known to be related to insulin resistance and type- <dig> diabetes. our data suggests that the method can be successfully used in pathway level differential analysis of gene expression datasets.

relationship between mcm d-value and mean difference of the distributions
suppose two sets s <dig> and s <dig> are drawn from two different distributions, then a good divergence value will satisfy the following property: the less the overlap, the higher the d-value. to validate that our mcm-test has this property, we performed the following steps:

 <dig>  generated  <dig> values from gaussian distribution n , where μ is the mean and σ is the variance, to use as gene expression data. the number  <dig> was chosen to mimic the real world diabetes dataset used for the analysis in this paper.

 <dig>  repeated step  <dig> for  <dig> times to get expression data of  <dig> genes

 <dig>  generated  <dig> values from gaussian distribution n , with x =  <dig> at this time.

 <dig>  repeated step  <dig> for  <dig> times

 <dig>  analyzed these  <dig> pairs of sets of values with mcm-test and obtained the d-value.

 <dig>  repeated step  <dig> to step  <dig> for  <dig> times and averaged the d-values over all the iterations.

 <dig>  repeated step  <dig> to step  <dig> for each x: x =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

impact of population size on standard deviation of mcm d-value
at this point, a natural question is, what the standard deviation of mcm d-values look like and how population size of d-value influences it. to answer these questions, we generated sample expression datasets and calculate d-values following a process similar to step  <dig> to  <dig> in the previous section. again, we fixed the pathway length to  <dig>  we repeat the process and obtained  <dig> d-values and calculated the standard deviation of the d-values. this is then repeated for  <dig> times and the  <dig> standard deviations are averaged and recorded as error rate of mcm d-value for that population size  <dig>  similarly we obtained the error rate for various d-value population sizes. as shown in figure  <dig>  the error rate decreases as the dataset size increases. we also note that the error rate becomes stable after the size of the population becomes greater than  <dig> 

relationship between mcm d-value and empirical p-value
suppose two vectors s <dig> and s <dig> are drawn from same normal distribution. what is the probability that the mcm d-value of these vectors is greater than a particular d? does the probability increases with the increase of d? to answer these questions, we studied the relationship between mcm d-value and empirical p-value as follows:

 <dig>  we generated  <dig> pairs of sets, each set with  <dig> values from standard normal distribution.

 <dig>  from these  <dig> pairs of sets, we randomly selected  <dig> pairs of sets to simulate expression data of a pathway with  <dig> genes under two conditions. we calculated d-value for this pathway. since we know that the data size required to obtain stable standard deviation of d-value is  <dig> from the previous experiment, this process is repeated  <dig> times.

 <dig>  for each pathway generated above with d-value d, we calculated the empirical p-value as n+1/ <dig>  where n is the number of d-values generated above that are equal to or greater than d. the relationship between the d-value and p-value is shown in figure  <dig> 

in figure  <dig> we can see that as the d-value increases, the p-value decreases. in particular, when d-value is greater than  <dig> , we have p-value ≤  <dig> .

impact of number of samples on error rate of mcm-test d-value
in order to understand the effect of the number of samples on error rate of mcm d-value, we generated datasets with different sample sizes. for each sample size, we generated  <dig> datasets and calculated the corresponding  <dig> d-values. the standard deviation of these d-values was calculated. this process is repeated  <dig> times and the average of the standard deviations is recorded as the error rate. the same is done for the other sample sizes. the relationship between number of samples and the error rate is shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the error rate decreases as the number of samples increases.

analyzing the diabetes dataset with mcm-test
the diabetes dataset contains the transcriptional profiles of smooth muscle biopsies of diabetic and normal individuals. in the expression dataset, for each gene, there are  <dig> expression values from subjects with type  <dig> diabetes ,  <dig> expression values from subjects with normal glucose tolerance  and  <dig> expression values from subjects with impaired glucose tolerance . for our analysis, we only used the  <dig> expression values from subjects with type  <dig> diabetes and subjects with normal glucose tolerance. furthermore, we used about  <dig> pathways obtained from kegg   <cit> .

the expression values in the dataset which are too small, i.e., less than  <dig> are considered to be the result of noise. so, to minimize the effect of these low values, we only included the genes which have at least one of the expression values greater than  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  genes in the dataset,  <dig>  met the filtering criteria. the d-value for each pathway was calculated as described in the methodology section before. the p-value for the pathway was calculated using permutation test. we permuted the genes  <dig> times, each time selecting the same number of genes as that of the pathway under consideration. we then calculated the d-value of each pathway obtained thus and the p-value for the pathway was the fraction of times the d-values of the pathways obtained by  <dig> permutation equaled or exceeded the original d-value.

the pathways are ordered in the ascending order of their p-values. the significant pathways, i.e., the pathways with p-value less than  <dig> , are then ordered according to the percentage of the genes in the pathway which were represented in the dataset. table  <dig> shows the result after sorting.

using our method, we identified the deregulation of mitochondrial pathways in the dataset which is in accordance with previous studies. the first cluster of genes involved was from the mitochondrial oxphos pathway. the oxphos pathway was well represented in the data with 93% of genes  present in the dataset. oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria provides energy in the form of atp generation. in muscle cells, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to insulin resistance and type- <dig> diabetes  <cit> . the involvement of genes coded by mitochondria in insulin resistance is also well known. the depletion of cellular mitochondrial dna has been shown to cause insulin resistance in experimental model  <cit> . reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation leads to the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides resulting in insulin resistance. the next  <dig> clusters, c20_u <dig> which is a manually curated cluster of genes coregulated with oxphos  <cit>  and the mitochondrial gene cluster human_mitodb_6_ <dig> reinforce that muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to type- <dig> diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we propose an innovative fuzzy-set-theory-based approach for differential analysis of gene pathways and apply it on identifying significant pathways for diabetes. experiments have been conducted on both synthetic datasets and real world dataset. results on real world diabetes data identified several number of gene pathways. of note our top significant pathways were related to mitochondrial function which is well known to be involved in insulin resistance and type- <dig> diabetes. this approach can be used not only for pathway analysis of other diseases but also for other domains. as measuring the difference of two groups of data are essential to most of researches, our approach provides a solution to this general and most critical problem.
