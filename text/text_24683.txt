BACKGROUND
identifying the primary targets of chemical compounds determines the selection of compounds suitable for drug development. it is cost effective to improve the accuracy of compound selection since it is a central bottleneck for pharmaceutical companies  <cit> . furthermore, to reveal the mechanisms of action and toxic side effects of a drug, the primary affected genes  must be identified . to distinguish the pags from indirectly affected genes is a recognized and difficult problem. currently used methods for pag identification have limitations. with haploid-insufficiency profiling  <cit> , a library of strains with heterozygous deletions is treated with a compound, and those exhibiting growth sensitivity are assumed to be the strains in which the pags are deleted. however, the targets must be known deletions and the compound's effect must be reflected by changes in growth. in association analysis, a mutant is assumed to have the pag deleted if its expression profile is associated with the expression pattern induced by the compound  <cit> . this strategy is referred to as a random search  since the profiles in the libraries are created randomly without choosing specific experiments in the search for pags. gardner et al. succeeded to identify pags using an approach  that however requires a detailed knowledge of the cell network architecture  <cit> , thus denoted as a network identification strategy. here we design and validate an algorithm, cuttree, which integrates selective experimental perturbations and gene expression measurements, in order to identify pags without requiring deletion libraries or knowledge of cellular pathways and network structures . validation of cuttree showed it capable of identifying four out of the five primary targets of galactose from  <dig> differentially expressed genes in yeast generated from only  <dig> different gene expression profiles.

RESULTS
we have designed and validated cuttree in silico and compared cuttree with established methods, primarily the network identification method used by gardner et al., since the network identification strategy outperforms library based techniques  <cit> . cuttree defined pags with increasing accuracy as the depth of the network tree increased; for example, it defined one pag in a six-level network in fewer than four experiments . a biological network's diameter is proportional to the depth of the tree and is larger than two, regardless of the size of the network  <cit> . it is therefore expected that cuttree should outperform an exhaustive search  in identifying pags in a biological network. this was confirmed by the in silico experiments, demonstrating that the performance of an exhaustive search strategy does not improve with the depth of the tree .

to identify a single pag the performance was not different between cuttree and an exhaustive search. however, cuttree clearly outperformed an exhaustive search strategy to identify two or five pags . the number of genes that are differentially expressed when the compound is applied to the wild type affected the performance of both methods. a large number of differentially expressed genes means a large search space and requires more experiments to find the pags .

we then compared cuttree with the network identification method developed by gardner et al  <cit> . only when 90% of the network architecture was known, the network identification method could define pags with an accuracy which could not be distinguished  from that of cuttree . however, when 50% of the network connections were known cuttree outperformed the network identification method. in conclusion, the in silico experiments clearly demonstrated that cuttree outperforms an exhaustive search strategy . the network identification approach  can only have a similar performance as cuttree when there is a close to perfect understanding  of the underlying biology. finally, we tested whether these results from cuttree were robust against noise in the data. we found that the noise level had to be larger than  <dig> %  in order to substantially reduce the performance of cuttree.

to experimentally validate cuttree, we applied the algorithm to a whole-genome expression dataset consisting of samples from the eight-gene galactose-response pathway in yeast  presented by ideker et al  <cit> . this is an appropriate experimental test of the algorithm because gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig>  and gal <dig> are known pags for galactose. galactose induces an atp-dependent complex consisting of three proteins, gal <dig>  gal <dig> and gal <dig>  <cit> . the binding of gal <dig> protein to the complex activates four different genes, gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig> and gal <dig>  moreover, the gal <dig> gene has been suggested to be regulated by the gal <dig> protein  <cit> . since there are no corresponding measurements of the gal3-gal4-gal <dig> protein complex in the micro-array experiments  <cit>  we considered these five genes to be pags. it has hitherto been unclear whether galactose activation of the gal <dig> protein also could activate other genes. incubating the wild type yeast with galactose yields more than  <dig> differentially expressed genes . to apply cuttree, we transformed the dataset produced by simultaneous application of galactose under  <dig> different conditions.  into  <dig> genes under nine conditions .

cuttree identified four out of five pags in the galactose-response pathway . note that this excellent performance is almost identical to the predicted accuracy of 70% from the in silico experiments . given the large number of possible combinations of five pags in a set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes , an exhaustive experimental library search would not have been feasible. interestingly, not all of the five pags are differentially expressed when galactose is applied demonstrating that pags could not be identified from inspection of the amount of fold change. in particular, the deleted genes are not as a rule, classified as pags by cuttree. for example, knockouts of the gal <dig>  gal <dig>  and gal <dig> genes, are correctly not labeled as pags by cuttree. thus, neither the fold change nor the knockouts are sufficient to reveal the identity of the pags . note that cuttree identified ylr460c, a previously unidentified pag for galactose but did not detect gal <dig> which have been suggested to be a pag. this could reflect more complex regulation of the pags by gal <dig>  such as an unknown intermediate step between gal <dig> and gal <dig>  possible involving ylr460c. gal <dig> has in contrast to gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig>  not been verified as specifically regulated by gal <dig> <cit> . furthermore ylr460c is a stress-response gene  <cit>  suggesting that under conditions of stress gal <dig> could also regulate this gene. gcy <dig>  might also be partly controlled by gal <dig>  <cit>  and could therefore be a pag. these suggestions are amenable for further experimental validation.

discussion
we have designed an algorithm, cuttree, which identifies the mechanisms of action of chemical compounds. cuttree could speed up the drug development pipeline, alleviating the current bottleneck in which the mechanism of action and side effects of current drug candidates are as a rule uncharacterized  <cit> . our strategy was to first validate the algorithm using in silico experiments and subsequently to test cuttree on public yeast data. the rational behind our in silico evaluation is that for chemical compounds there is yet no clear procedure on how to directly infer mechanism of action from experimental data. it is therefore essential to independently validate and benchmark any algorithm, including cuttree, which specifies an experimental design and data-analysis. consequently, the in silico data is particularly useful since the correct mechanism of action is inherently known by construction of the experiment. hence, the in silico evaluation ensures a proper estimation of the expected success rate and data requirement for inference of mechanism of action before applying the technique in the analysis and design of biological experiments. our in silico analysis demonstrated that cuttree can identify pags better than a random search method , in particular in the case of several pags . furthermore, our analysis predicted a 70% success rate when there are five unknown pags .

interestingly, this prediction came in close agreement with the experimental validation where cuttree identified four out of five  of the primary targets of galactose in yeast using data from  <dig> differentially expressed genes generated from  <dig> different perturbations. we may ask how many of the suggested candidates in the list generated by cuttree we would have to consider in order to identify those five pags? the estimated  <dig> % success rate from the in silico estimation informs us that if we consider the top  <dig> candidates, then we can expect  <dig>  true pags. this procedure would ensure  <dig> %  recall,  <dig>  %  precision, thereby a false positive rate of  <dig>  % . since there is always a trade-off between precision and recall which depends on the priorities of the experimenter there is also a rationale for choosing the top five candidates from the cuttree list with an estimated  <dig>  true pags, hence a recall of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  precision. now, as the validation using the experimental data demonstrates, choosing the top five candidates, gives  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  precision. the efficient performance of the cuttree algorithm relies on the fact that cuttree utilizes a simultaneous application of the chemical compound and a genetic perturbation such as a knockout. therefore, cuttree does not depend on the availability of a priori knowledge, which are currently available only for yeast . thus, cuttree is complementary to other methods  <cit>  which require large knockout libraries. even though cuttree does not require prior knowledge, information about putative pathways in which the compound could target facilitates the choice of the suggested initial genetic perturbation in the cuttree algorithm.

a complementary approach to cuttree is to first identify the underlying regulatory network and from the interaction map calculate the pags . such a network strategy has a similar performance as cuttree provided that close to  <dig> % of the interactions in the network have been identified . in gardner et al. a network strategy was designed and experimentally tested on e-coli for a previously well characterized small network of nine genes constituting the sos pathway. however, the applicability of such a network-based approach has hitherto been hampered by the difficulty to identify regulatory networks even in simpler organisms including e-coli and yeast  <cit> . to perform an estimate of the usefulness of a network based strategy depends on to what extent regulatory networks have been characterized as of today. clearly, any estimation of our current understanding heavily depends on the individual researcher's assumptions. for example, given that less than  <dig> %  <cit>  of the open reading frames  have been characterized, how large fraction of the yeast network has thereby been identified? one scenario is that we have complete knowledge of all the interactions between those characterized open reading frames . from this follows that  <dig> % of the interactions are unknown, since the interactions between the orfs only account for  <dig> % of the total number of interactions. this can be interpreted as an optimistic estimate since most likely there are interactions between orf that have not yet been characterized. for example, we would only know  <dig> % of the yeast network if  <dig> % of the interactions between the orfs were known. on the other hand, the estimates used are slightly biased on the negative side since we may have correlation-based information on the interactions between characterized orfs and uncharacterized orfs as well as mutual interaction between uncharacterized orfs. taking all these approximations together, we believe it is reasonable to argue that no more than about  <dig> % of all the interactions in yeast are known. considering the fact that the yeast regulatory network probably is the best characterized regulatory network as of today, cuttree should serve as a useful tool for detection of pags in yeast and other organisms, let alone mammalian cells, in the nearest foreseeable future. however, in the last couple of years there has been a rapid progress on algorithms and their application to experimental data for identifying cellular networks, mainly targeting e-coli and yeast  <cit> .

indeed, a recent study  <cit>  has demonstrated the success of a slightly modified network-based approach, here denoted as a mode-of-action by network identification , where the regulatory interactions in yeast are estimated from a large knockout compendium. the mni algorithm correctly enrich for known targets and associated pathways in the majority of compounds that were examined. however, there are a number of differences between cuttree and mni suggesting different domains of applications for the two algorithms depending on the amount of available prior biological knowledge;  the mni requires large libraries of expression profiles from treated cells in order to train the network model. for yeast mni used  <dig> different expression profiles which were available.  in addition, the mni requires a large amount of prior knowledge. the mni network model is based on principal component regression, thus reducing the network model of genes into a network model of metagenes since  <dig> expression profiles are not sufficient to identify a network model of genes. note that number of orfs is more than  <dig> times larger than the number of gene expression profiles. the pags, which were calculated from the compound action on the metagenes, were projected back to the genes. this step is essentially underdetermined and the mni approach therefore requires a library of pathways and relevant go classification in order to interpret the ranking of the metagenes. a preliminary analysis showed that the mni algorithm could not detect any of the galactose pags in the top  <dig> putative pags derived from the yeast gene expression library. the additional go classification method used in  <cit>  did not produce any significant pathways.

in contrast, cuttree does not require a library of expression profiles or a well-annotated system with pathways. hence, cuttree is adapted to precisely characterize the mechanisms of action of drugs and chemical compounds in systems where less prior knowledge is available but the disease relevance might be larger than compared to better described systems such as e-coli and yeast. furthermore, cuttree provides the experimentalist with a novel experimental design protocol for how to perform a sequential and simultaneous application of a compound and a genetic perturbation, such as a knockout, in order to obtain the most useful information.

CONCLUSIONS
cuttree is complementary to the network identification strategy, including the mni algorithm. cuttree therefore sets the stage for compound target identification in less well-characterized but more disease-relevant mammalian systems where novel genetic perturbation technologies such as srnai are making rapid progress. further biological experiments will tell whether cuttree is broadly applicable for drug evaluation using prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell lines and, more importantly, whether cuttree proves to be useful in the analysis of compound mode of action in mammalian cells.
