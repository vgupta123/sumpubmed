BACKGROUND
dna microarray technology is widely used for gene expression analysis studies  <cit> , as it is a high throughput technique by which the expression of all genes in a whole genome can be studied in a single assay. for many microarrays, the probe consists of cdna or oligonucleotides spotted on a glass slide, and the target is fluorescent labelled cdna . both direct as well as indirect labelling protocols are applied: either, one target cdna or crna is labelled with a single dye and hybridized on a microarray slide, or two targets are labelled with two different dyes, one for the reference and one for the test sample, and co-hybridized on a microarray slide. in dual label experiments, most often cyanine  <dig>  and cyanine  <dig>  are used as fluorescent dyes, although other dyes have been suggested  <cit> . in this way differential expression for thousands of genes between two different rna samples can be measured simultaneously. usually these experiments are time consuming, and, because microarray slides and fluorescent labels are expensive, the experiments are also high in costs. moreover, several replicates need to be performed to increase statistical significance and to detect small differences in gene expression  <cit> .

the application of four different dyes to label targets would be a major advantage as fewer microarrays will be required, leading to a reduction of costs and time without compromising gene expression data. a larger number of samples can be compared directly on a single microarray by labelling with more dyes, suggesting that fewer arrays will be required and that the hybridization design can be further optimized  <cit> . for instance, in the case that four samples need to be compared in all combinations, a dual-label common reference design requires four arrays for a single analysis of each sample, whereas a four-label design would require no common reference because all samples can be hybridized on a single array and only one array for a single analysis of each sample is needed. this will reduce variation, since variation between signal intensities for two dyes on a single spot is much smaller than variation between spots on different arrays  <cit> . furthermore, day to day variation is reduced since it is possible to achieve more hybridizations on the same day  <cit> . in toxicogenomics assessments, as well as in other research areas, the approach to use multiple dyes can be of high value as it allows comparing several exposure conditions or time series simultaneously.

forster et al  <cit>  were the first to study the feasibility of using a third dye  for labelling in microarray based gene expression analyses. although they found that alexa  <dig> gave a small signal in the cy <dig> channel during scanning and cy <dig> gave a small signal in the alexa  <dig> channel, they concluded that alexa  <dig> could be used besides cy <dig> and cy <dig> for direct comparison of two experimental samples and measuring these samples in relation to a reference sample.

the goal of our study was to investigate whether more than three different fluorescent dyes can be applied in gene expression studies using dna microarrays. this was studied using microarrays with cdna and oligonucleotide probes by hybridizing with a single sample labelled with four dyes . self-hybridization experiments are useful for measuring microarray data variability since any deviation from the expected value of  <dig>  is caused by systemic or technical variation  <cit> . we also studied the application of more than two dyes for gene expression changes caused by exposure of cells to benzopyrene, to verify that the new dyes can be applied simultaneously in microarray studies. in the present study, we demonstrate that on our cdna arrays four dyes can be applied, but that hybridization on the oligonucleotide arrays should be restricted to three dyes.

RESULTS
selection of fluorescent dyes
four different dyes were tested for signal cross-talk at the emission / excitation settings of the scanarrayexpress, namely alexa  <dig>  alexa  <dig>  cyanine  <dig> and cyanine  <dig>  therefore, the fluorescence of each dye at scanner settings of all tested dyes was measured. results are summarized in table  <dig>  since none of these dyes gives hardly any signal at settings for any other dye, it can be concluded that all dyes can be used simultaneously and were therefore considered suitable for use in microarray experiments. these dyes were further examined on two different microarray platforms.

optimizing laser power and pmt gain settings
the cdna microarray from phase-i molecular toxicology was hybridized with a single cdna target labelled with four different dyes . initial laser power settings for alexa  <dig>  alexa  <dig>  cyanine  <dig> and cyanine  <dig> were respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 80%, and initial pmt gain settings were respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  60%. in order to obtain the optimal scan settings for each dye, the array is scanned at different laser power and pmt gain setting. figure  <dig> shows, as an example, the data for varying laser power and pmt gain settings for alexa  <dig> 

in the scatter plots of data of one scan versus another, in general the data points indicate parallel lines when the settings are varied between the scans, implying that the fluorescent signals are consistent for all levels of gene expression when targets are labelled with these dyes. the larger distribution of the data points at low signals is a normal effect, which is due to reduced accuracy to measure signals from low expressed genes. compared to alexa  <dig>  varying laser settings gave similar results for alexa  <dig>  for cy <dig> and cy <dig>  the data points in the scatter plots run parallel for each setting. varying laser settings gave similar results for all tested dyes. the alexa  <dig> and alexa  <dig> graphs, however, show a minor disturbance in the lines of the data points when the laser is varied . this suggests that for these two dyes, a fixed laser power should always be applied, whereas the other dyes allow some variation. furthermore, these data indicate that laser power and pmt gain can be varied to some extend without affecting relative gene expression levels, as long as there is no saturation of signal intensities.

we also tested photo bleaching of the  <dig> dyes by scanning the microarray slide up to  <dig> times with the same scanner settings for all  <dig> dyes, and plotted the mean signal intensities as percentage of the signal intensity at the first scan . as is evident, photo bleaching occurs for all dyes as for all the signals decreases. the reduction was highest for alexa  <dig> and least for alexa  <dig>  but was always small . furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio did not change for either of the dyes after repetitive scanning . therefore, we conclude that the photo bleaching is not expected to hamper gene expression analyses on microarrays.

correlation coefficients between dyes at different laser power settings
the influence of laser power and pmt gain settings on the correlations between the combinations of dyes to a trend line was examined. a cdna microarray was scanned at the initial settings , and with a laser power of 70% or 100% and with adjusted pmt gain until none of the spots gave saturated signals. results are shown in the table  <dig>  these correlation coefficients show that for all possible combinations of dyes, increasing the laser power, and thereby reducing the pmt gain, results in a higher correlation coefficient. this suggests that these cdna microarrays with targets labelled with alexa  <dig>  alexa  <dig>  cy <dig> and cy <dig>  and scanned with the scanarrayexpress, could best be scanned at 100% laser power setting and adjusted pmt gain settings, in order to obtain the smallest variation in gene expression values. although the correlations are high and differences are marginal, the poorest correlation for the first array was found for alexa  <dig> combined with cy <dig> , and the highest correlation for alexa  <dig> with cy <dig> .

original scanner settings for alexa  <dig>  alexa  <dig>  cy <dig> and cy <dig> are: laser power  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 80% respectively, and pmt gain  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  60% respectively.

* the correlation coefficient between alexa  <dig> – cy <dig> is significantly higher than the correlation coefficient for any dye combination with alexa  <dig>  and the combination alexa 594-cy <dig> has a significantly higher correlation coefficient than cy3-cy <dig> .

the reproducibility was tested by several other self-hybridizations of different rna samples. table  <dig> shows the results for the correlation coefficients calculated for all combinations of dyes. numerical data from the table indicate that correlation coefficients for the repeated experiments are similar with mean correlation coefficients varying between  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

for the rat oligonucleotide microarray, also self-hybridizations with targets labelled with cy <dig>  cy <dig>  alexa  <dig> and alexa  <dig> were also conducted and the laser power was set to  <dig> or 100% with adjustment of the pmt gain until no saturation of fluorescence occurred. table  <dig> represents the correlation coefficients for these settings, and similar on this array, the correlations for all combinations of dyes are higher at laser power settings of 100% compared to 70%. however in all cases the correlation coefficients were smaller  compared to the cdna array. furthermore, table  <dig> shows that correlations between alexa  <dig> and any other dye are much lower than the correlation for any of the other combinations. this is probably due to the high background fluorescence for alexa  <dig> on these arrays compared to the spot signals. the ratio of mean spot signal to mean background variation  was clearly lower for alexa  <dig> then for the other dyes . the high background signal in the alexa  <dig> channel can not be due to auto-fluorescence of the corning slides alone as it was not observed when scanning an unhybridized microarray.

* the correlation coefficient between cy <dig> – cy <dig> is significantly higher than the correlation coefficient of alexa  <dig> – cy <dig> .

to reduce the background binding on the oligonucleotide arrays, we applied several different hybridisation and washing protocols. we varied bsa concentration in the hybridization buffer, added trna, cot <dig> or polya and used a commercial hybridization buffer . we also varied the concentrations ssc and sds in the washing buffers. the best results for all dyes were obtained by using the hybridization protocol as described in "microarray hybridizations" of the methods section. the data from this most optimal protocol are presented here.

with the exclusion of alexa  <dig>  the other dyes were tested in several more self-hybridizations with for each array a different rna sample in order to confirm the reproducibility. table  <dig> shows the correlation coefficients for all combinations of the  <dig> dyes. the correlation coefficients are similar for all repetitive experiments with mean values varying between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

standard deviation in relation to spot intensity for all combinations of dyes
the standard deviation for the 10log transformed expression ratios of the  <dig> or  <dig> replicate spots per gene on the arrays was calculated and plotted against the mean signal intensity of the corresponding dyes . for both arrays, the standard deviation decreased with increasing gene expression level. for the cdna array, the standard deviation was equal for all combinations of dyes at a 10log signal intensity of  <dig> and higher. at lower signal intensities, however, the standard deviation for combinations of any dye with alexa  <dig> were higher than for cy3-cy <dig> combinations, and standard deviations for combinations with alexa  <dig> are intermediate. for the oligonucleotide array, the standard deviation for all combinations of dyes with alexa  <dig> is higher at any signal intensity than for any other combination of dyes.

identification of modulated genes for various dye combinations
as microarrays are intended to identify genes that are differentially expressed between different rna samples, we tested the applicability of four dyes by analyzing rna samples from cells exposed to  <dig> concentrations of bp versus a vehicle control. table  <dig> shows the labelling and hybridization schedule for the bp exposed samples on the arrays , which was conducted to the two independent treatments . every dye was used for every rna sample, but not each dye combination was applied for each combination of control and test sample. for every bp concentration a confidence analysis was performed to select modulated genes for each dye combination separately. also, for all dye combinations combined , a confidence analysis was conducted. for the cdna array  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were found modulated for paired data of respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm. for the oligonucleotide array  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were found modulated for paired data of respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm. modulated genes for each dye combination were compared to modulated genes found all dye combinations paired. table  <dig> and  <dig> summarize the results for respectively the cdna arrays and the oligonucleotide arrays; they present numbers of modulated genes for specific dye combinations as a percentage of numbers of modulated genes by all dye combinations combined . on average, this percentage is approximately 45%, although in some cases it is clearly lower or higher. this deviation, however, is not consistent for a dye or a combination of dyes, so it can be concluded that all dyes perform equally well in identifying differentially expressed genes. also in these tables, the different dye-combinations are compared to each other, all as a percentage of modulated genes by all dye combinations . once again differences are observed, which are not sufficient consistent to conclude that one combination of dyes performs worse or better than another to identify modulated genes.

additionally, the performance of the dye combinations was evaluated by comparing the gene expression difference. figure  <dig>  which represents the results for the experiment with hepg <dig> cells on dna microarrays with the application of four dyes simultaneously, can be used as an example. for each dye combination a similar effect on gene expression is observed and it can be summarized that all dye combinations result in similar gene expression changes. for the rat liver slices similar results were found.

discussion
we have investigated the applicability of four fluorescent dyes in gene-expression analysis by microarrays. by using more than two dyes in microarray experiments, without lessening the data obtained, costs and time can be decreased as fewer microarrays are needed.

initially, several dyes were tested for cross-talk on the scanarrayexpress reader, and ultimately  <dig> dyes were tested for parallel use in microarray experiments. today, cy <dig> and cy <dig> are the most widely used dyes in microarray experiments and much research has been done on these dyes  <cit> , although alexa  <dig> and alexa  <dig> have been suggested by cox et al  <cit> . it was our intention to select dyes that could complement cy <dig> and cy <dig> and we show that alexa  <dig> and alexa  <dig> are suited for this and can be used for parallel hybridization in microarray experiments. all dyes were applicable on the tested cdna arrays. on the tested oligonucleotide arrays, however, only three dyes, namely alexa  <dig>  cy <dig> and cy <dig>  could be used.

selection of fluorescent dyes
based on cross-talk signals, four dyes – alexa  <dig>  alexa  <dig>  cy <dig> and cy <dig> – were found suitable for hybridization on microarrays and some cross-talk did occur for this combination. the highest fluorescence for a dye at settings of another dye was observed for cy <dig>  namely 13% cross-talk at the settings for alexa  <dig>  this cross-talk may influence differential gene expression analyses, especially if the signals for cy <dig> and alexa  <dig> differ drastically within a spot. therefore, in order to minimize artificial gene expression differences, scan settings should be optimized such that emission intensities are gross similar . furthermore, dye swap design on replicate arrays will reduce the bias resulting from cross-talk, and algorithms can be developed to eliminate this bias.

dye bias
dye bias is the difference in labelling efficiency between different dyes as one dye can be better incorporated than another; this can affect the gene expression data  <cit> . when using more than one dye, dye bias may occur and most likely, it is enhances with increasing number of dyes. dye bias can be reduced by using the indirect amino-allyl labelling instead of direct labelling, but it is not clear whether dye bias is fully eliminated  <cit> . however, dye bias can be eliminated by lowess normalization of the data, combined with a labelling and hybridization design in which each target is labelled with each different dye  <cit> . liang et al  <cit>  showed that the correlation between predicted and observed gene expression ratios increased by adding a second microarray with dye switching. this confirms that accuracy can be improved by adding dye swap replicates and applying a balanced labelling design. a balanced labelling design with four dyes may increase the number of required arrays, but still saves the total number of arrays. for example, when  <dig> treatments and a control are to be compared using  <dig> data points per comparison,  <dig> microarrays are needed for a common reference design,  <dig> arrays for a block design ,  <dig> when using a loop design, but only  <dig> with  <dig> dyes and the design shown in table  <dig> 

applicability of selected dyes
the applicability of the dyes was analyzed in four different ways. first by calculating the correlation coefficients between dyes in self-hybridizations, second by calculating the standard deviation of their log ratio per gene for replicate spots in the self-hybridizations, third by comparing numbers of modulated genes for all dye combinations in samples exposed to bp and finally by comparing gene expression modulation for several genes from samples exposed to bp.

when applied on the cdna array, all combinations of dyes gave high correlation coefficients  and thus seem suitable for parallel hybridization in microarray experiments. on the oligonucleotide array, the correlation coefficients were high for all combinations , except for combinations with alexa  <dig> . the correlation coefficients for all combinations of dyes on both arrays are constant in multiple repeated hybridizations. these results are supported by the plots for the standard deviation of the replicate spots. for the cdna array, the standard deviation is equal for all combinations of dyes at high gene expression level. however, for the oligonucleotide array the standard deviation of the signal intensity of high expressed genes for all combinations with alexa  <dig> is higher than the standard deviation for all other combinations of dyes. since the correlation coefficient of alexa  <dig> with other dyes is low and the standard deviation for alexa  <dig> is high, it is not advisable to use alexa  <dig> for labelling and hybridization on the oligonucleotide array.

the correlation coefficients observed for all combinations of alexa  <dig> with any other dye on the oligonucleotide array are lower than any of the other correlation coefficients. this was due to a high background signal and a lower signal-to-noise ratio in the alexa  <dig> channel, which can not be attributed to auto fluorescence. this background signal was much less pronounced on the cdna array, which may be explained by a different coating of the microarray slides. alexa dyes have a net negative charge, which may cause non-specific electrostatic interaction with positively charged molecules  <cit> . this may be a reason for why the dye adhered differently to the two different microarray slides. however, this does not explain why the background binding for alexa  <dig> is much less in comparison to that of alexa  <dig> 

for all dyes tested on the oligonucleotide array, many genes showed a low gene expression level compared to the cdna array. in general, weak signals are detected with lower accuracy than strong ones  <cit> . this is reflected by the higher standard deviations for lower signals in the plots for the cdna and oligonucleotide array . lyng et al  <cit>  showed that reliable data for mean signal intensities were only achieved within a range of  <dig> to  <dig>  . this clarifies the lower correlation coefficients found for the oligonucleotide array compared to the cdna array.

for all dye combinations, percentages of modulated genes relative to modulated genes for all dye combinations combined are generally equal . this indicates that any dye combination has approximately the same sensitivity to identify differentially expressed genes, and that the traditional combination of cy3-cy <dig> is not necessarily preferable above the others. therefore, we consider all dyes suitable for usage in gene expression studies by microarrays. this was further substantiated by the observation for several differentially expressed genes that the level of modulation is in the same range for all dye combinations.

although forster et al  <cit>  used a different approach to test the use of alexa  <dig> besides cy <dig> and cy <dig> in microarray analysis, their conclusions are in agreement with that of this study. forster et al  <cit>  tested the use of different combinations of two dyes in hybridization, and found some cross-talk between cy <dig> and alexa  <dig> and between cy <dig> and alexa  <dig>  although, some cross-talk was observed between cy <dig> and alexa  <dig> , only small cross-talk was noticed  for cy <dig> and alexa  <dig> in this study. forster et al  <cit>  also found a more linear relation between cy <dig> and alexa  <dig> than for cy <dig> and cy <dig>  however, we noticed only a small difference in correlation coefficient for cy <dig> / cy <dig> and for alexa  <dig> / cy <dig> . these differences could be due to the different testing methods and different arrays used.

CONCLUSIONS
all our experiments demonstrate that for gene expression analyses on microarrays alexa  <dig> is best suited as a third dye in addition to cy <dig> and cy <dig>  and that alexa  <dig> can be applied as a fourth dye on some microarray platforms, but unfortunately not on all array platforms. the general applicability of four dyes on other microarray systems is therefore uncertain, and needs to be investigated on a case-by-case basis.
