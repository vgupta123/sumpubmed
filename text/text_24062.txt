BACKGROUND
igf- <dig> is a multifunctional polypeptide hormone that plays a central role in controlling somatic growth and participates in muscle development, maintenance and regeneration  <cit> . several forms of igf- <dig> exist as splicing variants that are differentially distributed in different cell types and may have associated cell type specific functions. whilst the main source of igf- <dig> synthesis is the liver, its target cells are mostly in the liver and muscle. since muscle constitutes over  <dig> percent of the body mass, it becomes an important tissue to investigate the effects of igf- <dig>  igf- <dig> influences the development and maintenance of muscle cells at least partly through the early activation of signal transduction pathway proteins leading to the induction of specific transcription factors that consequently trigger downstream target genes. disruption of igf signaling by targeted knockout of the igf-ir gene causes growth impairment and severe skeletal muscle hypoplasia  <cit> . conversely, over-expression of igf- <dig> in skeletal muscle stimulates hypertrophy and also counteracts loss of muscle mass that occurs during aging in mice  <cit> .

igf- <dig>  igf- <dig> and insulin constitute a family of factors that regulate normal development and cellular function following initial binding to their dimeric cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases   <cit> . igf- <dig> and insulin and their receptors  are structurally closely related, but their actions result in markedly different downstream changes in different cell and tissue types. although insulin and igf- <dig> cross-react with their non-cognate receptors, each receptor binds its own ligand with a 100- to 1000-fold higher affinity thus triggering a signaling cascade that regulates cell differentiation, apoptosis and, proliferation  <cit> . igf- <dig> acting through its cognate receptor does not stimulate lipogenesis or rescue the lethal phenotype in mice that lacks the insulin receptor   <cit> . the insulin  and igf- <dig> receptors  being structurally related, target several common intracellular substrates. however, each hormone also elicits specific effects through differential phosphorylation of their common substrates. for instance, differential phosphorylation of fkhr, a forkhead transcription factor occurs in response to signaling from insulin or igf- <dig> receptor. in ir-deficient hepatocytes, one  of the three phosphorylation sites in fkhr was not phosphorylated, though they express igf-1r, resulting in distinctly different outcomes  <cit> . in addition, igf- <dig> action is regulated via its interaction with multiple binding proteins  <cit> .

a comparative microarray study investigating the effects of igf- <dig> and insulin  has shown that  <dig> genes were specifically responsive to igf- <dig> and  <dig> genes to insulin  <cit> . in mouse nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts igf- <dig> induced mitogenesis and/or differentiation whereas genes induced by insulin did not fall into any particular category  <cit> . exposure of c <dig> myoblasts to a mutated igf- <dig> derivative  resulted in the differential regulation of about  <dig> genes  <cit> . further the authors report identifying  <dig> muscle-specific as well as  <dig> un-annotated transcripts that are differentially expressed between igf- <dig> and pdgf treatment of igf-2-deficient murine c <dig> myoblasts.

in the present study we employed an affymetrix mouse array platform  to investigate the acute affects of exogenously added igf- <dig> on global gene expression profiles in murine c2c <dig> myoblasts by exposing these for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. the proportion of genes significantly affected by igf- <dig> in this study is low  and belong to a mixed array of gene ontologies. apart from the early induction or repression of transcription factors with igf- <dig> treatment, a surprising finding was the coordinate induction of most genes of two related pathways, namely the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. we therefore sought to determine whether this coordinate up-regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic genes in myoblasts, normally ascribed to as an insulin response, was modulated by the hierarchical lipogenic sterol regulatory element binding proteins . the srebps are not significantly transcriptionally induced with igf- <dig> treatment. however, there is elegant evidence to suggest that these transcriptional factors are regulated by a complex post-transcriptional mechanism  <cit>  and have been shown more recently by brown and collaborators  <cit>  to operate via akt to induce er-to-golgi transport of the srebp cleavage-activating protein  and thereby stimulate srebp processing.

RESULTS
global changes in gene expression
murine c2c <dig> myoblast offers a robust model to study the acute effects of igf- <dig> as expression patterns obtained here are indicative of the early changes leading to skeletal myotubule differentiation. we therefore investigated these global gene expression profiles following exposure of myoblasts to igf- <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours. correlation of data from the two independent experiments indicates reproducible expression signals for each partner time point at zero hour . a similar correlation was also obtained for the other experimental time points. we tentatively selected a two-fold  criteria  to be a conservative threshold for measuring alterations in gene expression.

pair-wise comparisons of microarray data, generated from two independent experiments revealed that about twice the number of genes are differentially up-regulated by two-fold or greater levels as compared to genes whose expression is down regulated  at the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of igf- <dig> treatment and the number of genes showing increased expression increases through hour  <dig>  the proportion of genes significantly affected by igf- <dig>  from the whole genome is low  demonstrating the specificity of igf- <dig> action on a subset of genes. though a number of the genes show some change  with igf- <dig> treatment, they are not altered by the two-fold or greater criteria used here. on the other hand, the expression of about  <dig> genes was wholly unaffected  with the treatment and these signal levels were indistinguishable from control samples at all time points. these unaffected genes belong to a mixed array of gene ontologies.

the temporal expression patterns of up- and down-regulated genes is shown in venn distributions  and the gene list for each overlapping and unique group is tabulated . the expression of  <dig> genes is both persistently and markedly up-regulated at all time points following igf- <dig> treatment . genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig> , dna-damage inducible transcript  <dig> , cation transport regulator-like  <dig> and hydroxysteroid , were induced at all time points . only two genes, namely, dual specificity phosphatase  <dig>  and inhibitor of dna binding  <dig> , were consistently down-regulated at all times .

the temporal pattern of genes up-regulated in mouse myoblasts following igf- <dig> treatment is tabulated based on their venn distribution. shown are genes up-regulated at:  <dig> hr only;  <dig> &  <dig> hrs; at  <dig> &  <dig> hrs;  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs only .

the temporal pattern of genes down-regulated in mouse myoblasts following igf- <dig> treatment is tabulated based on their venn distribution. shown are genes down-regulated at:  <dig> hr only;  <dig> &  <dig> hrs; at  <dig> &  <dig> hrs;  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs only .

the early induction events target a battery of transcription factors which include, early growth response  <dig> &  <dig> , snail homolog  <dig>  basic h-l-h domain containing class b <dig> , zinc finger protein- <dig> , -97-like , - <dig> , kruppel-like factor  <dig> , and immediate early response- <dig>  genes, that are all up-regulated following  <dig> hour of treatment. of these early responding transcription factors some, such as the early growth response- <dig> and - <dig> , zn finger proteins- <dig>  and - <dig> , immediate early response  and dna-damage inducible transcript  <dig>  gene are transiently expressed  exhibiting reduced expression after the initial surge. other early-induced genes, for example snail homolog  <dig> , seven in absentia  <dig> , kruppel-like factor  <dig> , basic helix-loop-helix domain containing factor , remain so for the rest of the treatment.

coordinate expression of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathway genes
at  <dig> hours of treatment igf- <dig> induced marked changes in two major pathways; those for  <dig> genes of the fatty acid and  <dig> genes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathways. the induced fatty acid genes include atp citrate lyase , acetyl coa synthase , long chain elongase , fatty acid synthase , stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig> . the key fatty acid regulatory gene, acetyl coa carboxylase alpha  did not respond to igf- <dig> treatment, though its signal levels were scored as 'present' under affymetrix' signal selection categories of 'present , absent , or marginally  present'.

the genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis that are induced by about two-fold or greater levels at  <dig> hours are listed. only a selective number of fatty acid genes are induced by igf- <dig>  acetyl-coa carboxylase a key and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway shows no detectable transcriptionally induction. genes common to the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways  are indicated  and genes showing 'no change' in expression levels are also listed .

the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway comprises multiple enzymatic steps leading to cholesterol biosynthesis and these genes are coordinately up-regulated by igf- <dig> . the key cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, namely hmg coa reductase    and  <dig> dehydrocholesterol reductase   are up-regulated to similar extents. with the exception of the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  , which is induced to over 6-fold levels, the other inducible cholesterol pathway genes are stimulated to 3- to 4-fold levels relative to untreated samples. in general, initial changes in expression levels for most fatty acid and cholesterol pathway genes is perceptible at  <dig> hours and is more pronounced at  <dig> hours of treatment . the expression of sterol-c <dig> desaturase  and hsdh <dig>  genes, however, is significantly induced at the earliest time point and remains induced for the entire period of treatment.

the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis that are induced by about two-fold or greater levels at  <dig> hours are listed. all genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis as well as those involved in cholesterol uptake , break down ) and transport ), are also up-regulated with igf- <dig> treatment. of the genes involved in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis only srebp <dig> and insig <dig> are feebly up-regulated, whereas scap and s1p genes are unaffected. there is no available chip data on s2p. genes common to the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways are indicated  and genes showing 'no change' in expression levels are also listed .

interestingly, the ldl receptor  , star-related lipid transfer domain containing  <dig>   and cholesterol  <dig> hydroxylase   genes that are involved in cholesterol uptake, transport, and breakdown, respectively, are also up-regulated in the same time frame .

of the many transcriptional factors implicated in the regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis it was of interest to examine the two principal factors srebp- <dig> and - <dig> . no measurable change was observed for the srebp- <dig> gene and no significant change  was observed for the srebp- <dig> gene with igf- <dig> treatment. the q-pcr data for srebp- <dig> is at variance with the microarray studies . srebp- <dig> and - <dig> are not significantly induced by igf- <dig> treatment alone. however, both srebp- <dig> and - <dig> are significantly induced when igf- <dig> is treated in the presence of the cycloheximide , a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. the expression of other genes involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of srebps, such as srebp cleavage activator protein   and, site  <dig> protease  were not induced, with the exception of insig <dig> which again was moderately  stimulated by igf- <dig> ). furthermore, none of the other known transcription factors/cofactors implicated in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, namely ap <dig>  ap <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  lxr, c/ebpbeta, nf-y, and red <dig> were induced by igf- <dig> treatment in this study.

microarray data was validated using q-pcr on a selection of  <dig> cholesterol biosynthetic pathway genes, namely hmg coa synthase  <dig> , hmg coa reductase , , cytochrome p <dig>  <dig> , lanosterol synthetase ,  <dig> dehydrocholestrol reductase  . a comparison of the microarray and q-pcr data for each of these genes shows that the profiles are similar. however, the extent of induction seen with q-pcr is more profound. for instance, microarray data for hmg coa synthase and hmg coa reductase  indicates a 3-fold change whereas q-pcr values show a 4- to 5-fold induction at  <dig> hours . likewise the relative expression values obtained with the other cholesterol biosynthetic pathway genes is greater though the profiles are quite similar. this similarity is further exemplified when a comparison of data from the two analytical methods is made for mk, lss and cyp <dig> genes. the mk  gene is markedly induced at  <dig> hours with both methods but remains largely uninduced at the earlier time points . however, induction levels obtained by q-pcr for the mvk <dig> gene at  <dig> hours  are about 2-fold greater than that obtained with microarray studies. further, microarray data for both lss and cyp <dig> genes show a more or less linear induction with igf- <dig> that is initiated at  <dig> hour  and is unlike the profile obtained for the mvk <dig> gene. again our qpcr data shows a similar pattern of induction for both genes though the change is about 2-fold greater at  <dig> hours .

the fold change profiles for  <dig> representative genes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, namely fatty acid synthase  and stearoyl-coenzyme a desaturase  <dig>   are similar with both methods. the scd <dig> gene, and not fas, shows a greater level of stimulation with the q-pcr assay. three regulatory genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, namely srebp- <dig> & - <dig>  and sterol cleavage activator protein  were examined . the pattern obtained is in general agreement with the affymetrix genechip data for these genes, with the exception of srebp- <dig> where no change was detected with the microarray study  as against a measurable change detected with the q-pcr assay .

the beta-actin gene included as an independent control here  showed no change with igf- <dig> treatment. further, we selected five genes unrelated to the fatty acid or cholesterol biosynthetic pathways, namely chac <dig>  klf <dig>  ier <dig>  socs <dig> and shh  that show distinctive patterns of early induction based on our microarray data. in addition, we selected dusp <dig>  a dual-specificity phosphatase gene , which is one of the two genes that are consistently down-regulated over the igf- <dig> treatment regime, to reflect a gene that was repressed by igf- <dig> treatment. the q-pcr profiles for all these six genes are shown  and closely resemble the characteristic expression patterns observed for each of these genes from our microarray studies with the exception that shh shows a slightly delayed induction. overall, the extent of change obtained with q-pcr was invariably greater than that noticed with the microarray studies.

discussion
global changes in gene expression
insulin characteristically influences the up- and down- regulation of more than  <dig> genes in various tissues and induces lipogenesis in muscle cells  <cit> . several target genes induced by insulin are not affected by igf- <dig> treatment at any time point in this study. for instance, glut <dig> ; glucokinase, aldolase a, phosphoglycerate kinase and gapdh ; glucose- <dig> phosphate dehydrogenase ; leptin and apolipoprotein a <dig> ; calmodulin  and plasminogen activator inhibitor- <dig>   genes  <cit>  that are characteristically up-regulated by insulin are not altered by igf- <dig> treatment. in contrast, we have identified a subset of genes typically activated by insulin, namely vegf, glut <dig>  igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  fatty acid synthesis genes, atp-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl coa desaturase  <dig>  cholesterol synthesis and uptake genes, hmg coa reductase, ldl receptor and egr- <dig> transcription factor gene, that are also activated by igf- <dig> in this study. moreover two genes, gapdh and pai <dig>  <cit>  that are induced by insulin were markedly down-regulated  by igf- <dig> in our study.

conversely, several liver-specific genes, known to be down-regulated by insulin including phospho-enolpyruvate carboxykinase , the rate limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis; 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coa synthase- <dig>  involved in ketogenesis; igfbp- <dig> carrier protein; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase- <dig>  involved in inhibition of lipogenesis, and two cytochromes p <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp8b <dig>  are all unaffected by igf- <dig> treatment. in contrast to the down-regulation of 5-aminolevulinate synthase- <dig> , the key and rate-limiting enzyme in heme biosynthesis by insulin, igf- <dig> induces its expression . despite the structural similarities between the insulin and igf- <dig> ligands and their receptors, the downstream pathways affected by these two hormones in myoblasts are different in important respects and follow divergent action streams. the divergent effects of insulin and igf- <dig> were reported earlier in a microarray study on mouse nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts where intracellular signals for these two peptide hormones are different  <cit> .

alternative measures such as quantitative pcr are widely used to validate gene expression data obtained with microarrays. we used q-pcr methods to assay selective genes involved in the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways as well as genes not directly related to these two pathways that were either induced or repressed  and found the results to be in general agreement with the affymetrix microarray chip data in that the direction and pattern of change were closely similar for most genes, though the fold change seen with q-pcr was generally greater. these findings are also in agreement with earlier reports that q-pcr validations are directional confirmation only and large discrepancies in the amount of change are observed  <cit> .

one of the early responses to igf- <dig> treatment was that the genes for a significant number of transcription factors were markedly induced. as indicated earlier several of these factors such as early growth response- <dig> & - <dig>  zinc finger protein- <dig>  -97-like, - <dig> , and immediate early response- <dig> genes , were transiently expressed. the expression of other transcription factors such as snail homolog  <dig> , seven in absentia  <dig> , kruppel-like factor  <dig> , basic helix-loop-helix domain containing factor  is sustained for the period of treatment. a large number of genes are either up- or down-regulated and belong to a mixed array of gene ontologies. however, it was interesting that some genes belonging to the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway and most genes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway were coordinately up-regulated at  <dig> hours following exposure of murine c2c <dig> myoblasts to igf- <dig> 

only a few of the  <dig> genes reported by dupont and coworkers  <cit>  from their  <dig> min study on igf- <dig> treated nih3t <dig> cells are up-regulated in our study on c2c <dig> myoblasts; namely, the early growth response  <dig> and a splicing factor, arginine/serine  <dig>  gene. c <dig> cells treated for  <dig> hours with an igf- <dig> analogue r3-igf- <dig> were shown to up-regulate about  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were muscle-specific  <cit> . the large number of muscle-specific genes induced by this prolonged exposure to igf- <dig>  is consistent with its role in myoblast differentiation. the lack of a similarity between the above two reports and the present study with mouse c2c <dig> myoblasts is likely due to the differences in cell types, induction times and igf- <dig> employed in the respective studies, and therefore it is not surprising that there are few common patterns.

regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol genes
insulin has been implicated in triggering lipogenesis and most evidence suggests that this stimulation is brought about via the induction of the srebps and other partner proteins associated with their transcription as well as post-transcriptional regulation. there is no transcriptional evidence to suggest that this coordinate up-regulation of lipogenesis in myoblasts, normally considered an insulin response, is modulated by the hierarchical srebps. for instance the srebp- <dig> transcription factor, implicated in the induction of fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> , was not transcriptionally activated by igf- <dig> in our microarray study . although, srebp- <dig> is reported to self-induce its own transcription by a 'feed-forward loop' mechanism  <cit>  we failed to see any significant transcriptional enhancement in myoblasts. further, srebp- <dig> is modestly  affected by igf- <dig> in our microarray   study. the related srebp cleavage activating protein   and the membrane bound site  <dig> and  <dig> peptidases  are not transcriptionally induced. however, insig <dig>  which triggers srebp cleavage, is moderately  induced . it should be pointed out that srebp-1a and -1c mrnas differ only in their 5' coding regions . the affymetrix mouse chip and our q-pcr analysis target the common 3' region of srebp-1a and srebp-1c and hence relate to both isoforms . however, it is reported that srebp-1a is a potent activator of gene expression as compared to the relatively weak inducer activity associated with srebp-1c  <cit> .

several transcription factors are implicated in insulin-mediated regulation of fatty acids and cholesterol biosynthesis, including ap <dig>  ap <dig>  srebp-1a, -1c and - <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  lxr, c/ebpbeta, nf-y, and red <dig>  <cit> . none of the aforementioned factors record a change in their relative gene expression signal levels with  <dig> hours of igf- <dig> treatment. an alternative explanation is that the post-transcriptional regulation of srebps, as outlined in several earlier studies  <cit> , could account for the coordinate induction of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic genes following igf- <dig> treatment.

tjian and coworkers  <cit>  have reported that the creb-binding protein  and p <dig>  are transcriptional coactivators that interact with srebp promoters. coexpression with p <dig> dramatically increases the expression of both srebp-1a and - <dig>  <cit> . our data indicate that neither of the co-activators, cbp or p <dig> is up-regulated. it is reported that cholesterol biosynthesis depends almost entirely on srebps whereas fatty acid synthesis is only partially dependent on these factors  <cit> . however, the lack of induction of these coactivators  with igf- <dig> treatment may account for the poor transcriptional induction of srebps and further support the proposal that post-transcriptional pathways operate to induce fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis in myoblasts.

srebps are the master regulators of lipid homeostasis and srebp- <dig> and srebp- <dig> are known to preferentially up-regulate genes involved in fatty acid or cholesterol biosynthesis, respectively  <cit> . brown and coworkers  in a series of interesting experiments in cho cells involving igf- <dig>  used a pi3k inhibitor to inactivate akt or expressed a dominant-negative form of akt and have reported that igf- <dig> induced fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis by a process mediated via the pi3k/akt pathway. more interestingly, igf- <dig> induces the transport of scap, the srebp cleavage-activating protein that escorts srebp from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi by a process which can be blocked with ly <dig>  which inhibits pi3k and can, thereby, affect akt activity. the cleavage of srepbs to release the active transcriptional factor operates through the stimulation of the pi3k/akt pathway by igf- <dig>  which in turn induces the transport of scap and srebp to the golgi and eventually results in the processing of srebp. processed srebps are localized to the nucleus to ultimately trans-activate fatty acid and cholesterol genes. it is therefore plausible that the igf-1-mediated induction of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways elaborately delineated by brown and coworkers  <cit>  is likely to operate by a wholly post-transcriptional process and occurs as an early stimulatory event in igf- <dig> treated myoblasts that are devoid of any significant transcriptional expression of srebps. it is also possible that other post-transcriptional mechanisms operate similar to the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of srebp-1c that was recently shown to promote its transcriptional activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present studies suggest that the acute action of igf- <dig> in murine myoblast, besides inducing and repressing an array of genes of diverse ontologies as presented here, also brings about the coordinate induction of several fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathway genes, probably through the trans-activation of the hierarchical srebp transcription factors through a previously elucidated subtle post-transcriptional mechanism that occurs via akt, initiating the transport of scap to the golgi and leads to increased proteolytic activation of srebps. another important avenue to explore is whether other factors cooperatively influence lipogenesis in myoblasts together with the srebps, following induction by igf- <dig>
