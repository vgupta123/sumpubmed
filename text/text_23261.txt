BACKGROUND
during the past several years, rnai-based approaches involving small interfering rnas  and shrnas have emerged as powerful tools to study gene function in mammalian cells. these rnas can be expressed intracellularly by cloning shrna-encoding templates into pol ii or pol iii transcription units  <cit> . pol iii-based strategies are ideally suited to express shrnas due to the natural role of pol iii to synthesize small rnas with precisely defined ends at very high levels, reaching up to  <dig> ×  <dig> transcript copies per cell  <cit> .

for many applications, including transgenic approaches involving genes whose inactivation is embryonically lethal, it would be desirable to express shrnas conditionally. two general strategies have emerged allowing controllable production of shrnas in mammalian cells. the first strategy is based on modified pol ii or pol iii promoters, controlled by drug-responsive repressors or transactivators such as tet-dependent repressors or transactivators  <cit> , ecdyson-dependent transactivators  <cit>  or the hiv- <dig> tat protein  <cit> . in an alternative strategy, the cre-lox recombination system was exploited to turn shrna synthesis on or off  <cit> . in contrast to the repressor/transactivator-dependent systems, the effects of the cre-lox system lead to irreversible changes in the vector genome.

regulatable expression cassettes encoding shrnas have been delivered into mammalian cells by transient or stable transfection or by using viral vectors such as lentiviral vectors. alternatively, vectors based on oncogenic retroviruses or adenovirus-based vectors are being used  <cit> . it is evident from the recent literature that the currently available expression systems for regulated shrna production differ widely in terms of gene silencing efficiency and control thereof. for example, to attain significant knockdown of target gene expression using adenoviral vectors encoding shrnas corresponding to the c-myc coding region, multiplicities of infection  up to  <dig> were used  <cit> . it is not clear whether the need for such high mois was caused by poor transduction efficiencies or ineffective shrnas, or both.

tet-regulatable lentiviral vectors encoding shrnas were first described by wiznerowicz and trono  <cit>  and by miyagishi et al.  <cit> . in the report by wiznerowicz and trono, mois of at least  <dig> were used to attain efficient target gene knockdown. in this case, mois were calculated based on titers obtained by flow cytometric analysis  of vector-encoded egfp expression in hela cells. given that measurements based on facs lead to an underestimation of vector titers, the number of shrna-encoding vector genomes per target cell may have been up to 20-fold higher  <cit> . miyagishi et al.  <cit>  observed robust knockdown of target gene expression using lentiviral vectors at lower mois. however, this was only observed following isolation of cell clones. however, selection of cell clones is not always possible particularly in the context of primary cells.

recently, lentiviral vector systems bearing tet-reponsive pol ii promoters and shrna-sequences embedded in a microrna context were described  <cit> . in these studies, transduced cells expressing high shrna levels were first enriched by facs prior to determining the robustness of shrna-mediated knockdown of target gene expression in such cells. thus, the usefulness of these systems and their background expression levels in unsorted cell populations remain to be determined.

in this study, we present quantitative data demonstrating that, when the hu <dig> promoter is engineered to contain a single to sequence between the pse and the tata box, or an additional second-generation tre upstream of the promoter, knockdown of target gene expression can be tightly and reversibly repressed in the presence of a modified tetr bearing a krab silencing domain. we also describe the performance of a novel u <dig> promoter system in which the dse of the hu <dig> promoter was replaced with a second-generation tre. in this system, positive regulation of shrna production is mediated by a novel tet-dependent transactivator, rttasp <dig>  bearing the transactivator domains a and b of the human sp <dig> transcription factor  <cit> .

RESULTS
design of improved lentiviral vectors for conditional, dox-dependent expression of shrnas
our goal was to design improved binary tet-regulatable lentiviral vector systems bearing tet-responsive pol iii promoters allowing tightly controlled and reversible rnai-mediated knockdown of target gene expression. to accomplish this, lentiviral vectors were developed harboring tet-regulatable hu <dig> promoters controlled either using a chimeric tetr or tet-dependent transactivators . several tetr-responsive promoter constructs were designed. in the tet-hu <dig> construct, a 22-bp to sequence was placed between the pse and the tata box of the hu <dig> promoter . in the tre/tetu <dig> construct, a second–generation tre, lacking a tata box and consisting of eight repositioned to sequences  <cit>  was placed upstream of the dse . for dox-controlled production of shrnas from tet-hu <dig> and tre/tetu <dig> promoter-bearing vectors, a lentiviral vector expressing a chimeric tetr protein containing a krab-ab silencer domain  <cit> , referred to as tet-tts was developed .

in a second strategy, tet-regulatable hybrid hu <dig> promoters that responded to tet-dependent chimeric transactivators were designed. in one such promoter construct, referred to as pittΔu <dig>  the hu <dig> dse element that supports pol iii transcription  <cit> , was replaced using a second-generation tre lacking a tata box  to make it responsive to sp1-containing transactivators  <cit> . for dox-controlled production of shrnas from the hybrid pittΔu <dig> promoter, novel tet-controlled reverse transactivators bearing glutamine-rich transactivation domains derived from the human sp <dig> transcription factor were constructed . hybrid rttasp <dig> transcription factors bearing the sp <dig> ab domain, the b domain or a truncated b domain  <cit>  fused to the dna binding domain of a reverse tet-controlled transactivator   <cit>  were developed. these transactivators are referred to as rttasp <dig>  rttasp <dig> and rttasp <dig>  respectively .

knockdown of target gene expression in cells co-transduced with lentiviral vectors containing the of tet-hu <dig> promoter and the tet-tts repressor
the ability of lentiviral vectors bearing the modified tet-hu <dig> promoter and of vectors bearing the unmodified hu <dig> promoter to knock down egfp target gene expression in hela g/r cells co-expressing egfp and dsred was evaluated first. all virus stocks were adjusted based on titers determined by real-time pcr. knockdown of egfp expression was analyzed by facs. it was found that knockdown of egfp expression was efficient with the unmodified hu <dig> promoter leading to a reduction in the mean fluorescence intensity  of the egfp-expressing cell population below 15% of that seen in mock-infected hela g/r cells . the tet-hu <dig> and mu <dig> promoters were found to be slightly less efficient at the same mois, with the mfi levels reduced by some 80% and 70%, respectively relative to those seen in untransduced hela g/r cells . when the shrnas produced from these promoters was modified to include six additional nucleotides at the 5' end, referred to as hu <dig>  and tet-hu <dig>  respectively, knockdown of egfp expression was reduced compared to that seen with the unmodified constructs . in all cases, dsred expression levels were not impaired indicating that the knockdown was specific.

controlled knockdown of egfp expression was investigated next. to do this, hela g/r cells were co-transduced with a constant amount of the shrna-producing lentiviral vector and variable amounts of the tet-tts lentiviral vector. half of these samples were cultured as normal; the other half were cultured in the presence of dox. cells were harvested  <dig> days after co-transduction, and egfp expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. egfp expression in co-transduced cells was then compared to untransduced cells . it was found that egfp expression was tightly controlled in cells transduced with the tet-hu <dig> vector at tet-tts mois of  <dig> and  <dig> by the inclusion or exclusion of dox in the culture medium. however, transduction of the tet-tts vector at an moi of  <dig> did not lead to tight promoter shutoff in the absence of dox. as expected, a cxcr4-specific control shrna did not cause any decrease in egfp levels with or without dox. these findings were then verified by northern blot analysis of rna extracted from hela g/r cells co-transduced with tet-tts and shrna-expressing lentiviral vectors at mois of  <dig> each . quantitation of the blot revealed that in the presence of dox, egfp mrna levels in cells co-transduced with tet-hu <dig> and tet-tts decreased by as much as 74% compared to untransduced cells.

to extend our studies, we next attempted to silence expression of the human chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> gene in a controlled manner. to do this, shrna-encoding sequences containing 27-bp overlaps with the target sequence  <cit>  were cloned downstream of the tet-hu <dig> and tre/tetu <dig> promoters present in lentiviral vectors. the ability of such lentiviral vectors encoding shrnas corresponding to cxcr <dig> to silence cxcr <dig> expression in a regulatable manner was assessed by determining cxcr <dig> protein levels.

to do this, hos-cd4-fusin cells that overexpress cxcr <dig>  <cit>  were co-transduced with lentiviral vectors bearing hu <dig>  tet-hu <dig> or tre/tetu <dig> promoters to drive expression of shrnas corresponding to cxcr <dig> mrna and with a tet-tts-expressing lentiviral vector at mois of  <dig> each. cells were cultured with or without dox. after  <dig> days, a flow cytometric analysis was carried out to determine the cxcr <dig> levels in transduced cells compared to mock-transduced hos-cd4-fusin cells . it was found that knockdown of cxcr <dig> expression was very efficient. there was a 89% ±  <dig> %, 91% ±  <dig> % and 88% ±  <dig> % decrease in the mfi of the cells following transduction with lentiviral vectors bearing hu <dig>  tet-hu <dig> or tre/tetu <dig> promoters, respectively. in the absence of dox, cxcr <dig> receptor levels were unaltered indicating that repression was tight. as expected, expression of the tet-tts repressor alone did not affect cxcr <dig> receptor levels . in agreement with the facs data, there was a drop in cxcr <dig> mrna levels in the presence of dox but not in the absence as determined by quantitative rt real-time pcr .

to show that knockdown of cxcr <dig> expression in hos-cd4-fusin cells is reversible and to establish the kinetics of knockdown, hos-cd4-fusin cells were transduced at an moi of  <dig> for both the tet-tts and shrna-expressing lentiviral vectors. the transduced cells were then expanded in either the absence  or the presence  of dox for  <dig> days, at which time dox was added to the cells previously grown in the absence of it and removed from those previously grown in its presence. the cells were analyzed for cxcr <dig> expression by flow cytometry. this analysis revealed that, after  <dig> days of growth in the absence of dox, cxcr <dig> expression decreased to almost  <dig> background levels within  <dig> days of the addition of dox  . however, after removal of dox from the medium of cells initially cultured in its presence, it took significantly longer for cxcr <dig> expression to reach control levels  . this finding suggests that intracellular dox persisted for some time after removal of dox from the culture medium.

positive control of pol iii promoter activity using novel tet-dependent transactivators
we next wanted to investigate a different approach allowing conditional expression of shrnas from tet-responsive pol iii promoters using novel tet-dependent transactivators. to do this, hos-cd4-fusin cells were co-transduced with an shrna-encoding lentiviral vector containing the pittΔu <dig> promoter  and various rttasp <dig> transactivator-encoding vectors  at an moi of  <dig> for each vector. the transduced cells were then incubated in the presence of dox for  <dig> days and then analyzed by flow cytometry. the results presented in figure  <dig> show that knockdown of cxcr <dig> expression in cells transduced with lentiviral vectors containing the pittΔu <dig> promoter-cxcr <dig> shrna expression cassette along with lentiviral vectors encoding rttasp <dig> transactivators was most efficient with the rttasp <dig> transactivator. in this case, cxcr <dig> expression decreased by 61% ±  <dig> %  while shrnas expressed from a lentiviral vector bearing an unmodified hu <dig> promoter led to a 82% drop at the same moi . in contrast, when other rttasp <dig> transactivator-encoding vectors were used, silencing of the target gene was less pronounced. cxcr <dig> levels dropped by 41% ±  <dig> % and 34% ±  <dig> % for the rttasp <dig> and rttasp1-encoding vectors, respectively. silencing of cxcr <dig> expression resulting from cxcr <dig> shrnas was reversible. five days after removal of dox, cxcr <dig> levels reached those observed with cells bearing pittΔu <dig> promoter-cxcr <dig> shrna cassettes alone . as expected, expression of the rttasp <dig> transactivator alone did not change cxcr <dig> levels. however, in hos-cd4-fusin cells singly transduced with a lentiviral vector bearing the pittΔu <dig> promoter-cxcr <dig> shrna expression cassette, there was a 26% drop in cxcr <dig> levels as judged by flow cytometry indicating that the pittΔu <dig> promoter is leaky.

as expected, the mfi of cells co-transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the pittΔu <dig> promoter-cxcr <dig> shrna cassette and a lentiviral vector encoding the rtta2s-m <dig> transactivator  <cit>  in the presence of dox were unaltered relative to mock-transduced cells . this is consistent with previous findings that transactivators containing sp <dig> domains preferentially transactivate pol iii-type promoters while vp16-domain-containing transactivators preferentially interact with mrna-type promoters  <cit> . it was interesting to note however, that binding of the rtta2s-m <dig> transactivator to the pittΔu <dig> promoter in the presence of dox reduced the promoter's leakiness . reduced leakiness of the pittΔu <dig> promoter-cxcr <dig> shrna vector was also observed in cells transduced with the tet-tts lentiviral vector . thus, the leakiness observed with the pittΔu <dig> promoter can be overcome by co-expressing rttasp <dig> and tet-tts sequences in target cells.

discussion
lentivirus-based vectors provide powerful tools for the introduction of shrna-encoding sequences into primary cells, es cells and embryos  <cit> . however, in general, only a fraction of the transduced cells display detectable rnai at variable levels  <cit> , indicating that the expression of shrnas from lentiviral vectors is affected by position effects. this problem can in part be overcome by using high enough mois to ensure multiple shrnaencoding cassettes per genome. among those cassettes, some are expected to escape position-dependent effects, resulting in sustained shrna expression. alternatively, isolated cell clones obtained by facs sorting of transduced cell populations can be used to increase the robustness of shrna-mediated gene knockdown  <cit> . unfortunately, selection of cell clones is not always possible particularly in the context of primary cells. more importantly, selection strategies are in general not feasible in vivo.

to characterize our lentiviral vector system for its capacity to conditionally knock down gene expression, we chose the egfp transgene as a target for our initial investigation. it was found that silencing of egfp protein and mrna production was repressed quantitatively in the absence of dox provided that a high enough moi of the two vectors was used. it was also found that in contrast to the findings reported by lin et al.  <cit> , our single-copy to configuration allowed tightly regulated egfp knockdown. the improved performance of our system compared to that reported by lin et al. may be related to the fact that a tetr bearing the potent krab silencing domain was used in our work. in contrast, lin et al. used an unmodified tetr. to fully validate the two systems, it will ultimately be necessary to compare shrna levels in transduced cells in the presence and absence of dox using northern blot experiments.

as a second target, we chose the cxcr <dig> chemokine receptor gene. in our tet-regulatable lentivirus system, robust cxcr <dig> knockdown was observed in unsorted cell populations at mois of  <dig>  the excellent performance of our system may be due in part to the design of the shrnas. it was recently reported that synthetic dsrnas and shrnas longer than 19– <dig> bp were able to more efficiently enter the rnai pathway and to knock down the target gene without causing nonspecific effects  <cit> . based on these findings, we used cxcr4-specific shrnas,  <dig> nt in length.

it is evident from figures  <dig> and  <dig> that insertion of a single to sequence upstream of the tata box had only a minor effect on the performance of the tet-hu <dig> promoter. also, the experiments presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> show that rnai mediated by the tet-hu <dig> and tre/tetu6-containing vectors was tight in the absence of dox. this indicates that the two systems performed equally well as far as hos-cd4-fusin cells are concerned.

the position of the tre element appears to influence background expression. recent evidence presented by zhou et al.  <cit>  has shown that the distance between the tre element and the promoter sequence is important as far as pol ii promoters are concerned. tre elements placed in close proximity to a pol ii promoter sequence displayed lower background expression compared to tre elements placed farther away within the viral ltrs. it remains to be determined whether the same is true for pol iii promoters.

with a view toward designing pol iii promoters that respond to tet-dependent transactivators, we developed an alternative tet-dependent lentiviral vector system. in this system, novel dox-dependent transactivators consisting of sp <dig> transcription factor transactivation domains fused to a truncated version of the rtta2s-m <dig> protein lacking the vp <dig> transactivation domain were expressed from lentiviral vectors. expression of shrna is achieved from a hybrid u <dig> promoter lacking the dse. using this system, dox-dependent knockdown of cxcr <dig> expression was clearly evident as shown in figure  <dig>  however, there was background expression in the absence of the transactivator and/or dox. interestingly, cells co-transduced with a lentiviral vector bearing the pittΔu6/shrna-encoding sequences and a second lentiviral vector encoding the rtta2s-m <dig> transactivator in the presence of dox displayed lower background expression possibly due to the fact that the rtta2s-m <dig> transactivator blocked pol iii activity. reduced background expression was also observed in cells bearing the tet-tts repressor . it is conceivable that cells displaying lower background expression could also be isolated by facs sorting or drug selection. such a strategy was used by gupta et al.  <cit>  to isolate ecdyson-inducible cell clones expressing shrna from hybrid rna pol iii promoters in response to a gal4-oct2q transactivator. while this manuscript was in preparation, amar et al.  <cit>  described a regulatable lentiviral vector system containing a hybrid transactivator consisting of the oct2q transactivation domain fused to the rtta2s-m <dig> dna binding domain and a u <dig> core promoter preceded by  <dig> to sequence. similar to our system, this system was found to be leaky in the absence of dox. however, isolated clones displayed low background expression and robust inducibility.

for tight and reversible rnai in vivo, it would be desirable to have combined vectors available harboring tet-dependent repressors or transactivators as well as shrna-encoding sequences. attempts to generate such vectors have been reported by others  <cit> . however, these vectors appear to be leaky.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide quantitative data suggesting that robust and tightly regulated knockdown of gene expression can be obtained using lentiviral vectors bearing either a single to sequence or a second-generation tre in transduced cell populations without the need for sorting cell clones.
