BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus is an opportunistic pathogen of humans, causing local and systemic infections, and is a frequent cause of food poisoning. this species belongs to the b. cereus group, which includes the closely related species bacillus anthracis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus weihenstephanensis,bacillus mycoides and bacillus pseudomycoides  <cit> . b. cereus produces several secreted proteins, including enterotoxins, cytolysins, phospholipases and proteases that may contribute to b. cereus pathogenicity. the expression of most of these virulence factors is controlled by the pleiotropic transcriptional activator plcr  <cit> . this global regulator has been shown to contribute to b. cereus virulence in mice and insects  <cit>  and in rabbit endophthalmitis  <cit> . expression of the plcr regulon is activated at the onset of the stationary phase of growth  <cit> . this activation results from cell-cell communication under the control of papr, a small peptide that is exported, processed, and re-imported into bacterial cells in its mature form, presumably a pentapeptide, by the oligopeptide permease  <cit> .

haemolysins of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins  family  have been identified in several genera of gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . these pore-forming toxins appear to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the organisms producing them  <cit> . listeriolysin o has been extensively studied, and this cdc has been shown to be an important virulence factor, essential for the cellulosome escape and intracellular multiplication of listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . in streptococcus pyogenes, the spn gene, which encodes an effector protein, is located upstream from the gene encoding streptolysin . cytolysin-mediated translocation involving these two proteins has been described in this bacterium  <cit> . in this process, slo acts as a gate when anchored in the target-cell membrane. spn is thus translocated into the cytoplasm of the target cell, increasing cytotoxicity  <cit> . the study of genes present in the same operons as cdc-encoding genes may therefore increase our understanding of virulence mechanisms in these bacterial pathogens.

cdc have been identified in bacteria of the b. cereus group. these proteins are named cereolysin o  in b. cereus, thuringiolysin o  in b.thuringiensis and anthrolysin o  in b. anthracis  <cit> . we show here that three paralogous copies of an unannotated gene encoding a 26-amino acid peptide are present in the b. cereus atcc  <dig> genome  <cit> . one of these paralogues was co-transcribed with the gene encoding cereolysin o, and all three paralogues were expressed in a plcr-dependent manner.

RESULTS
identification of a small gene, co-transcribed with clo
small peptides often remain unannotated at the time of bacterial sequencing projects  <cit> . however, many such peptides have been shown to play a major role in bacterial physiology. analysis of the clo chromosomal region of b. cereus atcc  <dig> revealed the presence of a  <dig> bp orf between a putative plcr box and the clo gene . this orf, starting with an atg codon, was predicted to encode a 26-amino acid peptide and was called pep <dig>  it was preceded by a typical ribosome binding site at an appropriate distance.

primer extension was carried out in order to map the transcription start site of the clo gene, using b. cereus total rna extracted after various culture times. the 5'-end of the mrna corresponding to clo was located downstream from the plcr box, and upstream from the pep <dig> gene, indicating that a bicistronic transcript consisting of pep1-clo had been produced . this result suggests that pep <dig> and clo were co-transcribed from a single transcription start point in the conditions tested. the - <dig> and - <dig> regions of this promoter are highly similar to the - <dig> region  and - <dig> region  of vegetative promoters recognised by the σa rna polymerase of b. subtilis . similar experiments were performed with rna extracted from the b. cereus Δ plcr strain. no signal was detected at t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> in such conditions , indicating that expression of the pep1-clo operon was plcr-dependent. this result is consistent with the lack of detection of the clo protein in the extracellular fraction of the b. cereus Δplcr strain  <cit> .

identification of pep paralogues and orthologues in the b. cereus group
the deduced amino-acid sequence of the peptide encoded by pep <dig>  was used to screen the complete genome of b. cereus atcc  <dig> by tblastn. this search led to the identification of another two paralogues elsewhere on the chromosome, not located close to any particular gene. these paralogues were called pep <dig> and pep <dig>  the ncbi nr database was also screened by tblastn. this analysis showed that orfs presenting strong sequence similarity with pep <dig> were identified in all the members of the b. cereus group . in most of the completed genomic sequences, pep <dig> orthologues were found in multiple copies, up to three copies, depending on the strain. in all of the genomes in which pep <dig> orthologues were identified, one copy was located upstream from a cdc-encoding gene . recently, the 5'-end of the alo transcript was mapped  <cit> . despite a slightly diverging sequence between alo and clo promoter regions, the 5'-end of the alo transcript was positioned downstream from the plcr box and upstream from the pep <dig> orthologue, revealing that in b. anthracis, a pep1-alo bicistronic transcript was detected, as in b. cereus . thus, the structural organisation of the operon constituted of pep <dig> and a cdc-encoding gene seems to be conserved between species of the b. cereus group.

no sequence displaying significant similarity to pep <dig> was identified in bacteria outside the b. cereus group, or in other sequences in the databases, indicating that pep <dig> orthologues are probably restricted to the b. cereus group. however, in the genome of the atypical b. cereus strain nvh 391– <dig>  no pep <dig> orthologue could be identified. in this strain, the genome has a reduced size  compared to the other b. cereus group members  <cit> , and no cdc encoding gene is present. this finding is consistent with the fact that this strain is genetically distant from other b. cereus group members  <cit> .

plcr-dependent expression of pep <dig>  pep <dig> and pep3
in silico analysis revealed the presence of a plcr recognition site  about  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the three pep genes in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  alignment of the upstream region of the pep <dig>  pep <dig> and pep <dig> genes identified in b.cereus atcc  <dig> showed that the three promoter regions were very similar to the - <dig> and - <dig> regions recognised by the σa rna polymerase of b. subtilis . a plcr recognition site was also found upstream from all the pep orthologues identified in the other bacteria of the b. cereus group .

we investigated whether the expression of the pep genes in b. cereus atcc  <dig> depended on plcr, by inserting about  <dig> bp, including each of the 5'-pep regions, upstream from the lacz reporter gene of pht304-18z . b. cereus strains carrying the three different recombinant plasmids were cultured in lb medium and β-galactosidase activity was measured at various stages, from the exponential growth phase to the late stationary phase . the kinetics of β-galactosidase production were similar for all three strains, with pep-directed lacz transcription activated at the end of exponential growth. however, transcription from the pep <dig> promoter appeared to begin earlier, whereas that from the pep <dig> promoter was activated later. these slight variations in the time course of expression may reflect differences in promoter efficiency, which might result from differences in the affinity between plcr and its target sequences. our results indicate that all three copies of pep are expressed in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  the transcriptional activity of the three pep promoters was drastically decreased in the b. cereus atcc  <dig> Δ plcr mutant . thus, the expression of the three pep genes is plcr-regulated. however, weak plcr-independent expression was detected for pep2'-z , pep1'-z and pep3'-z  . this expression was significantly higher than that observed with the negative control pht304-18z without promoter . in b. anthracis, the plcr regulator is not functional because the plcr gene is truncated  <cit> . a weak alo expression was detected by rt-pcr in b. anthracis cells grown in lb medium  <cit> . alo expression was also detected in b. anthracis cultured in rich media or grown in infected mice  <cit> . thus, the weak expression of pep1-clo detected in b. cereus atcc  <dig> Δ plcr, may be similar to the alo expression observed in b. anthracis, which does not produce an active plcr molecule. these peptides were designated spp, for small plcr-regulated peptide.

putative role of the spp peptides
bacillus species are known to produce and export an abundance of small peptides. several of these peptides are involved in signalling or have antimicrobial activity  <cit> . analysis of the deduced amino-acid sequence  of spp <dig>  with the signalp  <dig>  server showed there to be no predicted signal peptide. however, a double-glycine motif was found at positions  <dig> to  <dig> in all the spp orthologues . this double-glycine motif is a characteristic of some secreted peptides, such as competence-stimulating peptides in streptococci and bacteriocins in lactic acid bacteria  <cit> . the leader region of such peptides is cleaved after the double-glycine motif by an abc transporter  <cit> . the presence of the double-glycine motif suggested that spp is exported. by analogy to the described functions of double-glycine peptides in other gram-positive bacteria, and given that competence has never been described in b. cereus, we hypothesized that spp has a bacteriocin-like function.

for analysis of the physiological role of spp, the entire deduced amino-acid sequence of spp <dig> , and the  <dig> aa c-terminal region of this peptide  were synthesised chemically, giving pep <dig> and pep <dig>  respectively. these two molecules were tested against various target bacterial cells, to determine whether spp <dig> had bacteriocin-like functions. no growth inhibition was observed with the negative control  for any bacterial cell , whereas pep <dig> displayed antibacterial activity at high concentrations  on bacillus target cells: b. subtilis, b. thuringiensis, b. cereus f <dig>  and b.cereus atcc  <dig> . the antibacterial activity of pep <dig> was detectable at dilutions down to  <dig>  mm. pep <dig>  also displayed antibacterial activity against other gram-positive target bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria innocua, but not against staphylococcus aureus . we also assayed activity against gram-negative indicator bacteria: pep <dig>  displayed weak antibacterial activity against salmonella spp., but not against escherichia coli k <dig>  proteus mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa . antibacterial activity of pep <dig>  resulted in only a small growth inhibition zone in assays with bacillus indicator cells , and no effect was observed against other indicator bacteria. the c-terminal region of spp <dig>  had stronger antibacterial activity than the entire spp <dig> molecule . this suggests that processing by cleavage downstream from the double-glycine motif may be necessary for peptide activation.

among the indicator strains tested, b. cereus strains which are spp producers, were the most affected by the pep <dig> antibacterial activity. thus, other maturation process such as posttranslational modifications, are probably required to protect the bacterial cells against their own peptide.

when b. cereus vegetative cells were incubated  <dig> hour in a phosphate buffer supplemented with pep <dig> , the number of cfu decreased from  <dig>   × 107/ml to  <dig>   × 106/ml . in the same conditions, the number of b. subtilis cfu decreased from  <dig>  × 107/ml to  <dig>  × 105/ml. this indicates that pep <dig> was bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic against these target cells.

however, although spp is expressed, there is no evidence that spp is actually synthesized and secreted. furthermore, given the high concentrations of pep <dig> required in our assays, we cannot rule out that the antibacterial activity detected is caused by the high pep <dig> hydrophobicity rather than by a specific antibacterial activity.

b. cereus has been isolated from soil, and from the gut of insects and nematodes  <cit> . like many other bacteria isolated from such ecological niches in which there is strong competition between numerous species of micro-organisms for colonisation, b.cereus has been shown to produce antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . recently, an antibacterial substance with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, active only against gram-positive bacteria, was described in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  <cit> . this antibacterial activity is probably not caused by spp, because its antibacterial spectrum is different and the predicted molecular mass of spp <dig> is lower:  <dig>  kda , and  <dig>  kda for the c-terminal fragment of spp <dig> . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that spp <dig> undergoes post-translational modifications, accounting for differences in molecular mass and antibacterial spectrum.

two small peptides with double-glycine leader sequences produced by competent cells of s. pneumoniae were recently shown to be involved in the lysis of non-competent s.pneumoniae cells, leading to the release of pneumolysin, a non-secreted cdc. this work revealed the existence of co-operation between bacteriocins and a cdc  <cit> . in b. cereus, clo, which is found in the extracellular fraction  <cit> , is most probably exported by the sec machinery because it has a signal peptide. thus, the link between spp and clo is probably different from that described in s. pneumoniae.

in s. pyogenes, a co-operative effect between a cdc  and a protein  encoded by a gene from the same operon has been observed. this co-operative effect increases toxicity to target cells  <cit> . we showed that spp <dig>  and clo are co-transcribed in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  this operon structure was found to be conserved among bacteria belonging to the b. cereus group. these findings suggest that clo and spp might co-operate to play a role similar to that of slo and spn in s.pyogenes, in specific ecological niches or growth conditions that remain to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has led to the identification of spp genes present in all members of the b. cereus group. we showed that the three spp genes of b. cereus atcc <dig> were expressed in a plcr-dependent manner. in all the b. cereus group strains, a spp gene is coexpressed with the cdc genes encoding cereolysin, thuringiolysin or anthrolysin. the biological signification of this co-expression and the proposed spp antibacterial role will have to be clarified.
