BACKGROUND
microrna is a class of approximately 21-nucleotide  small rna that regulate endogenous gene expression in eukaryotes ranging from single cellular green alga to mammals and flowering plants. many biological processes including development, senescence, metabolism and stress responses are regulated by mirnas  <cit> . in plants, mirnas are distinguished from other small rnas in that they are excised precisely from specific positions on stem-loop precursors by dicer-like  <dig>  with the assistance of hyl <dig> and serrate  <cit> . the mature mirnas are 2'-o-methylated at 3' end by hen <dig> and exported into cytoplasm. after being loaded into rna induced silencing complex  the mirnas anneal to the complementary sites on target mrnas to impose translational repression or/and cleavage of target mrnas  <cit> .

mir <dig> and mir <dig> are highly conserved mirnas that play important roles in plant growth, morphogenesis and reproduction  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the 21-nt mature mir <dig> and mir <dig> share  <dig> identical nucleotides. however, they have distinct target genes due to sequence specificity and different expression patterns  <cit> . mir <dig> restricts the expression of some myb transcription factors, while mir <dig> targets a subset of tcp transcription factor genes  <cit> . expression of mir <dig> is abundant and widespread over the whole plant, while mir <dig> is expressed at much lower level and confined to specific tissues and developmental stages  <cit> . mir <dig> can not induce mrna cleavage of the mir319-targeted tcp transcription factors due to sequence specificity. although the mir <dig> can also mediate the cleavage of myb <dig> and myb <dig> mrnas, mir <dig> does not normally make significant contribution to the regulation of myb because of its low and specialized expression  <cit> . the interplay of mir <dig> and its target myb is involved in the regulation of vegetative growth, flowering time, anther development, seed shape and germination  <cit> . in contrast to mir <dig>  mir <dig> and corresponding targets regulate embryonic patterning, jasmonate synthesis, leaf morphogenesis and senescence  <cit> . a recent study also showed the regulatory role of mir <dig> in the development of petal and stamen  <cit> .

a distinguished feature of the mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes conserved from moss to flowering plant is that their stem-loop precursors usually have elongated stem structure. a loop-proximal segment on the mir159/ <dig> stem-loop precursor outside of the mirna and mirna* is also conserved, albeit to a much weaker extent  <cit> . recent studies show that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> precursors are processed from loop to base to liberate three phased mirna duplexes  <cit> . the mir <dig> or mir <dig> can not be efficiently excised without correct processing of the loop-proximal mirna duplex  <cit> . according to this scenario, when mir <dig> or mir <dig> duplexes are produced the same amount of mirnas derived from the other two duplexes must be generated. however, only the mature mir <dig> or mir <dig> are abundantly expressed while the alternative mirnas are expressed at low levels, indicating that only mir <dig> or mir <dig> are incorporated into risc and stabilized. conservation of such an uncommon pattern in biogenesis during the long time evolution of land plants is inexplicable by the known function of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  the underlying significance of such unusual style of maturation for the mir159/ <dig> genes remains unknown.

with similarities in sequence, conservation pattern and biogenesis, mir <dig> and mir <dig> might originate from a common ancestor. conversely, differences in expression patterns, target genes and functions indicate that mir <dig> and mir <dig> are evolutionarily distinct groups. although clear evidences are absent to support the common origin of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> , they are categorized into one mirna gene family in the mirbase and some other studies  <cit> . hypothesis has been proposed that the mir <dig> might evolve from mir <dig> because mir <dig> seems more specialized in the spectrum of targets  <cit> . however, the phylogeny of the two hypothesized subfunctionalized groups remains unknown.

in order to study the evolution of mir159/ <dig> family in land plants, we collected and analyzed a broad set of mir159/ <dig> stem-loops from a wide range of plant species. then, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of mir159/ <dig> from a structural alignment using rna models for paired and unpaired nucleotides, thus revealing the evolutionary history of this mirna gene family. our analysis also suggests that post-transcriptional regulations of mir159/ <dig> expression have evolved during plant evolution, through which mir159/ <dig> mirnas respond to defensive sirna deficiency. this provides explanations for the conserved three-duplex dicing of the mir159/ <dig> precursors as a framework for an unknown product-tunable mechanism controlling output from their stem-loops. taken together, our analysis revealed the evolutionary history of mir159/ <dig> genes, conservation and variability of post-transcriptional regulation across their extant clades during phylogeny.

RESULTS
homology search for mir159/ <dig> genes
in order to get a comprehensive view of the mir159/ <dig> gene evolution in land plants, we performed homology search like previous studies to collect the mir159/ <dig> stem-loop sequences from available data resources as exhaustive as possible  <cit>  . along with the published sequences, we obtained  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes and  <dig> candidates from  <dig> land plant species . notice that  <dig> genes from two species, oryza alta and oryza glaberrima, in figure  <dig> are not included and analyzed further because full-length stem-loop sequence could not be retrieved from the database. mir159/ <dig> genes from most of the major land plant clades are obtained making it possible for an informative phylogenetic reconstruction.

classification of mir159/ <dig> genes according to conservation pattern
in the species of brassicaceae closely related to arabidopsis thaliana, the most conserved part of mir <dig> genes is the sequence of the precursor stem-loop  <cit> , which is also conserved in distantly related species  <cit> . mutations accumulated in the mirna stem-loops during evolution may provide useful information for inferring the phylogeny of mirna families with ancient origin. we aligned the mir159/ <dig> stem-loops considering both sequence and rna secondary structure by a semi-automated strategy . we found that not all mir159/ <dig> precursors have conserved elongated stem and can be well-aligned in the loop-proximal regions. according to sequence and structural conservation of the loop-proximal regions, we classified the mir159/ <dig> genes into  <dig> types . type  <dig> stem-loops show a "bi-duplex" conservation pattern similar to previously discovered  <cit> . however we observed much stronger conservation in the loop-proximal regions . clearly, two duplexes are conserved in both sequence and secondary structure across  <dig> land plant species from moss to flowering plants . the structural logo shows pronounced similarity in the two loop-proximal regions comparable to that of the mir* region, unlike the poorly conservation of these regions found previously  <cit>  . this is probably due to the preclusion of other types of mir159/ <dig>  which do not have well-conserved loop-proximal regions. consensus structure and nucleotides were predicted for the type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes. ten consensus base-pairs were detected including a highly conserved u:a pair in the loop proximal regions . noticeably, there is a consensus interior loop in the duplex of mir159/ <dig> and the corresponding mirna* indicating that selection pressure favor the structural pattern as a whole. nine partitions can be assigned in the type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> stem-loops according to conservation pattern. there are four conserved partitions: mir, mir*, alternative conserved region at 5'arm  and 3'arm , which accommodate most of the conserved paired or unpaired nucleotides. the conserved partitions are separated by five space partitions  . this type is the most widely distributed, while the other types do not have well-conserved loop-proximal duplexes and exist only in a few plant species .

the remaining types are with degenerated acrs  or even lacking these two regions . type  <dig> stem-loops appear as in a shortened form without the elongated part probably due to deletion . sequences of the loop-proximal regions are conserved in type  <dig> stem-loops . however the secondary structure is disrupted. the elongated stem is maintained in type  <dig> stem-loops, but sequence similarity in the region corresponding to acr of type  <dig> is too weak to be identifiable . type  <dig> stem-loops do not have identifiable acr sequences and the elongated stem is interrupted by multi-loops . conservation of the type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes across land plants indicates the origin of mir <dig> and mir <dig> from a long stem-loop. the type  <dig> to  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes seems to be variants evolving from type  <dig>  during evolution, the loop-proximal part on their precursor stem-loops may degenerate in sequence and/or structural conservation to different extent. since the processing of mir159/ <dig> genes depends on correct processing of the loop-proximal duplex  <cit> , these mir159/ <dig> genes may lose their activity due to unsuccessful processing. for example, the processing of ath-mir159c, which is a type  <dig> gene, is far less efficient than that of its paralogues  <cit> . likewise, mutations outside of the mature mir <dig> may lead to failure in the processing of mir <dig> in b.oleracea  <cit> . therefore, some if not all type  <dig> to  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes might be "pseudo-mirna" genes unable to produce mature mirnas.

phylogeny of the mir159/ <dig> genes
during evolution the manner of base substitutions in structured rna is different from that in protein-coding sequences. the selections for mutations in structured rna mainly arise from base-pairings to maintain the rna structures while in protein-coding sequences selection pressure disadvantages mutations in triplet codes that disrupt protein functions through alteration of amino-acids. based on the structural alignment and consensus rna secondary structure of the type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree using a combination of gtr and doublet models in a bayesian approach  <cit> . a well-supported consensus tree was obtained . the three a.thaliana mir <dig> paralogues are far more distantly related to each other than that of the ath-mir159a and ath-mir159b in the tree, consistent with the inference from the mirna-carrying segmental duplications in arabidopsis  <cit> . the observation that ath-mir159a and ath-mir159b have very similar expression patterns and are functionally redundant while the three mir <dig> paralogues have distinct expression patterns also supports the inferred relative distances among the paralogues of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in a.thaliana  <cit> . in addition, the relationships of ath-mir319b with its sense and antisense duplicates were correctly resolved in the tree . these observations provide additional supports for the reliability of the inferred phylogenetic tree.

using moss, the earliest-branching clade in land plants, as out group, phylogeny of the mir159/ <dig> could be determined. the mir159/ <dig> genes from moss, lycopod, gymnosperms and angiosperms can be clearly separated into  <dig> major clades . all extant mir159/ <dig> genes of moss derive from the earliest branching clade . the smo-mir <dig> and smo-mir <dig> are two extant genes of two clades branching before the emergence of seed plants . after the diversification of lycopod mir <dig> and mir <dig>  clades of mir159/ <dig> specific to either gymnosperm or angiosperm formed . in flowering plants, there are two early-branching clades leading to the founding members of mir <dig> and mir <dig> identified in a.thaliana respectively  <cit>  .

duplication and loss of genes are deduced from the tree using the criteria that duplications increase the number of paralogues in one clade, while gene losses were inferred by the absence of an ancestral gene in descendant clades. because the split of orthologous genes must predate or accompany the split of related species that carry them, the time of the duplications relative to the emergence of new plant clades can be deduced. six duplications can be deduced from the condensed tree showing early-branching clades, one in the common ancestor of vascular plants and five in the common ancestor of seed plants . the tree shows that the split of the mir <dig> and mir <dig> clades in flowering plants and gymnosperms originated from a series of duplications occurring in the common ancestor of seed plants . this suggests that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes classified by the founding members identified in a.thaliana originated from a common ancestor, which may have emerged after the split of moss and lycopod mir159/ <dig> clades. the two angiosperm mir <dig> clades branched earlier than the angiosperm mir <dig> clades. subsequent duplications led to the formation of gymnosperm clades and angiosperm mir <dig> clades . six possible losses in the major clades of mir159/ <dig> can be deduced from the condensed tree, one in lycopod and five in gymnosperms and angiosperms . because our analyses do not include all the species in a given clade and entire genomes are only available for a small number of species, the deduced gene losses are incomprehensive and indicate only the possible inclination of gene evolution in the species examined. however, deduced losses are of high confidence in the species for which genome-wide scan of mir159/ <dig> gene have been performed . of the six possible losses, four are supported by the absence of ancestral mir159/ <dig> genes in one or more species where the entire genomes were examined . the other two losses are deduced to have occurred in gymnosperms whose whole genome sequences are currently not available . therefore, these two losses and loss of gymnosperm mir159/ <dig> in 'early branching eudicot mir319' need to be verified in the future using the whole genomes of gymnosperm species . considering the current data, these gene losses may have occurred in an interleaved manner that descendant species mutually lost the equivalent of extant genes in other descendant species after gene duplications in their common ancestor. it appears that clade-specific groups of mir159/ <dig> genes may have formed through the dynamics of gene duplications in ancestors and gene losses in descendants as opposed to the divergence of one ancestral gene into orthologues. the duplications and subsequent losses that occurred before the split of monocots and eudicots are more frequent in the mir <dig> clade than the mir <dig>  indicating that the two clades might have evolved in different ways .

shift in the proportion of mature mir159/ <dig> products during ontogeny
mir159/ <dig> precursors are processed in a phased manner to produce three mirna duplexes  <cit> . we examined the expression of mir159/ <dig> in  <dig> publicly available small rna sequencing databases from  <dig> species . interestingly, the partitions defined by conservation pattern are consistent with the phasing of mature mirnas from mir159/ <dig> stem-loops in that very few reads have lower than 80% overlap with any partition . in most cases, mir159/ <dig> take up the majority of the sequencing reads, while mirnas from mir*, acr <dig> and acr <dig> are expressed at much lower levels. the expressions of space partitions are even lower or undetectable . we refer to this previously identified profile as 'canonical proportions'  <cit> . however, there are a few non-canonical situations. when we analyze the expressions of mir159/ <dig> using data from atsbs  <cit> , we found that in the inflorescence tissues of five-week-old arabidopsis thaliana, the predominant mature products of ath-mir319a are acr <dig> mirnas, while the ath-mir319b mainly expresses acr <dig> and mir* mirnas . in contrast, the ath-mir <dig> genes primarily generate mir <dig> . in the flowering tissues of the closely related species arabidopsis lyrata, the non-canonical expression of mir <dig> was also supported by two databases  from two independent studies using solid and illumina genome analyzer respectively  <cit>  . in consensus, expressions of the acr <dig> mirnas are promoted and higher than the mir <dig> in aly-mir319c/d, albeit differences in the expressions of aly-mir319a and aly-mir319b between the two databases, which is probably due to sampling of the tissues at different stages. in , the mir319* is significantly higher than mir <dig> and acr <dig> of aly-mir319a is lower than aly-mir319b . in , mir319a/b is more abundant than mir319a/b* and acr <dig> of aly-mir319a is higher than aly-mir319b . small rna sequencing from seed coats and cotyledons of glycine max  suggests that gma-mir <dig> express acr <dig> mirnas at levels similar to or higher than mir <dig> in these tissues  <cit>  . in nicotiana tabacum plants, data from comparative sequencing of plant small rnas  showed non-canonical expressions of both mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit>  . however, in the case of nta-mir <dig>  the acr <dig> mirna is the most abundant in flower but not in pod . we also found acr5-predominant expression of mir <dig> in solanum lycopersicum using data from cspsr  <cit>  . again using cspsr data  <cit> , non-canonical expression of mir <dig> was observed in vitis vinifera .

recently, the parallel analyses of rna ends  technology was used to detect cleavage products of mirna targets that contain a phosphate at 5' end by deep sequencing  <cit> . processing intermediates of mirna precursor can also be detected by pare  <cit> . the differences of mirna production between mir <dig> and mir <dig> are also supported by data from arabidopsis pare database  <cit>  . for mir <dig> precursors, the most abundantly sequenced cleavage site was the 5' end of acr <dig> mirnas. however, 5'end of mir <dig> was the most frequently sequenced site for mir <dig> precursors. this coincided with the data from atsbs   <cit> . because small rna sequencing and pare are different technologies in nature, the observed differential expressions of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in arabidopsis inflorescence are unlikely to be resulted from biased sequencing. interestingly, the detected cleavages occur predominantly within the stem-loop pre-mirnas . this indicates that the mir159/ <dig> primary transcripts might be processed into mirna duplexes directly without the preceding step to liberate the stem-loop precursors consistent with the findings of chekanova et al.  <cit> .

we also observed the switching on of the mir <dig> or mir <dig> acr mirna expression in monocots. in rice, analyses using high throughput small rna sequencing data deposited under  suggest that osa-mir159a mainly produces acr <dig> mirnas in the flag leaves , which is an organ important for grain filling and protection of the spike from being eroded by pathogens. sequencing data from  suggest that acr <dig> mirna is the major product of osa-mir <dig> in rice seedlings  <cit>  . in maize, a shift in the proportion of mature mir <dig> products was observed in the tissues of shoots and roots using the data from   <cit>  . such a transition is not observed for maize mir <dig> . another two examples of non-canonical expression of monocot mir159/ <dig> come from cspsr data  <cit>  . in hordeum vulgare plants, expression level of mir <dig> acr <dig> mirna is higher than mir <dig> in leaves but not in inflorescence tissues, indicating shift of mature product proportions in the two tissues . in flower and young panicle of sorghum bicolor, acr <dig> mirnas are more abundant than mir <dig> . these results indicate that both in eudicots and monocots, the major products of mir <dig> or mir <dig> genes shift to acr mirnas in a highly spatio-temporal specific manner during plant development. this is likely to occur through post-transcriptional mechanisms, because the proportion of the multiple mature products can not be changed solely via transcriptional regulations. in some cases, shift in strand selection also occurred. when sequencing tags can not be unambiguously assigned to a unique mir159/ <dig> stem-loop, such as maize mir <dig> genes in figure 5i, related paralogues are analyzed collectively. in this case, the observed shift in mature product proportion could possibly be attributed to down- or up-regulation at transcriptional level of different paralogues with fixed mature product proportions. however, there must be a post-transcriptional mechanism to distinguish different paralogues so that they produce multiple mature mirnas in different proportions.

for the gymnosperms and earlier-branching clades, lycopod and moss, we also analyzed the expressions of the mir159/ <dig> genes using small rna sequencing data from cspsr and   <cit> . in cycas rumphii leaves, the three phased mirnas at 3' arm, acr <dig>  sp <dig> and mir <dig> are expressed at significant levels, among which acr <dig> is the most abundant . in the lycopod s.moellendorffii, the predominant products of both smo-mir <dig> and smo-mir <dig> are acr <dig> mirnas, consistent with the distance in the inferred phylogenetic tree . the proportion of mature products from the moss mir <dig> differs from all other clades in that the acr mirnas are rarely expressed while the sp <dig> and sp <dig> mirnas are expressed at significantly higher level . because the sp <dig> mirna of ppt-mir319d is abundantly expressed, this mirna is annotated as ppt-mir319d*. <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with our analysis. in 10-day-old moss protonemata the mir319* are the most abundant products . the distinct proportion of mature products from the mir159/ <dig> genes in different clades suggests that the post-transcriptional control of mir159/ <dig> gene output may have diverged during evolution accounting for the variability of mature mirna expression profiles of this family.

selective up-regulation of mature mir159/ <dig> mirnas in sirna-deficient mutants
in plants, genomic repeats are silenced by approximately 24-nt rasirnas whose expression depends on the rdr <dig> and dcl <dig> proteins  <cit> . unexpectedly, we found that in sirna-deficient mutants of species from eudicot, monocot and moss mir159/ <dig> mirnas are selectively up-regulated. using atsbs data  <cit> , we found that in the inflorescence tissues of 5-week-old a.thaliana rdr <dig> mutants and dcl <dig> dcl <dig> dcl <dig>  triple mutants, the expressions of the ath-mir319a and ath-mir319b acr <dig> mirnas are much higher than the case in wild type, over  <dig> fold for ath-mir319a and approximately  <dig> fold for ath-mir319b . in contrast, the increased mir <dig> and mir319* expression is undistinguishable from the enrichment of the 20~21-nt srnas in these mutants . analyses using data from  reproduce this phenomenon with the difference that mir <dig> levels are also up-regulated when the rasirna pathway is disrupted   <cit> . consistently in both databases the increased levels for acr mirnas of ath-mir319a are higher than that of ath-mir319b . because the two small rna sequencing data resources were produced using different methods,  <dig> for  and solexa for atsbs  <cit> , the observed selective up-regulation is unlikely to be bias of sequencing. the selective up-regulation of mir <dig> acr mirnas is absent in dcl <dig> single mutants , probably due to redundant dcl activities  <cit> . we also examined the expression of mir159/ <dig> in maize using data from maizesbs  <cit> . similarly in the small ears  of maize mop1/rdr <dig> mutants, the expression of mir <dig> acr mirnas is selectively up-regulated . in the dcl <dig> mutant of the moss p. patens, the overall abundance of mirnas does not increase  <cit> . using the same small rna sequencing data, it can be observed that the mir <dig> increased approximately seven-fold and became the most abundant mature product of mir <dig> gene . the sp <dig> mirnas also increased more than four-fold . in rdr <dig> mutants, in which tasirnas are depleted without affecting the mirna abundance  <cit> , only the sp <dig> mirnas increased approximately seven-fold . these results suggest that the accumulation of specific mir159/ <dig> mirnas, e.g., the acr mirnas in flowering plants, is regulated either directly or indirectly by sirna pathways at the post-transcriptional level. this connection between the sirna and mirna pathways might have an ancient origin.

discussion
from the evolutionary perspective, mirnas are generally classified into highly conserved ancient mirnas and weakly conserved species- or clade-specific mirnas  <cit> . the phylogeny of highly conserved mirna genes is largely unknown including the ancient mirna gene family -- mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which play important roles in plant development  <cit> . the mir <dig> and mir <dig> were identified in independent studies using different methods  <cit> . homologues identified in following studies are classified into two groups according to sequence similarity to the mir <dig> and mir <dig> founding members  <cit> . although mir <dig> and mir <dig> are seemingly related in evolution, because of their similarity in mature mirna sequence, secondary structure, conservation pattern and biogenesis, their origin is still unclear  <cit> . evolution of mir <dig> genes in closely related brassicaceae species has been studied revealing that the stem-loop and an upstream element of mir <dig> are recalcitrant to fast mutations while sequences of other parts are highly variable  <cit> . we aligned a large number of land plant mir159/ <dig> stem-loops and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree. our results support a common origin of mir <dig> and mir <dig> from two aspects. first, another duplex outside mir159/ <dig> are highly conserved in most mir <dig> and mir <dig> stem-loops across land plants . moreover, partitions defined by the conserved regions are consistent with the phasing of mature mir159/ <dig> mirnas from moss to flowering plants  <cit>  . these observations suggest that mir <dig> and mir <dig> originated from a common phased stem-loop rna similar to those discovered in the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and rice recently  <cit> . second, the inferred phylogenetic tree shows that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> founding members in a.thaliana evolve from two early-branching clades specific to flowering plants, which derived from the common ancestor of seed plant mir159/ <dig> . the tree also shows that the angiosperm mir <dig> major clade branched earlier than the angiosperm mir <dig> clade . this is consistent with the finding that mir <dig> is more specialized in target spectrum than the mir <dig> in a.thaliana  <cit> .

the inferred phylogenetic tree reveals the evolutionary history of extant mir159/ <dig> branches, which might be dated back to the first colonization of land plants about  <dig> ma . it can be inferred that extensive duplications of mir159/ <dig> genes might have occurred in the common ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms about  <dig> ma, in the period of late devonian to early carboniferous. these duplications initialized the split of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in flowering plants. it has been shown that major body-plan innovations during animal phylogeny are concomitant with mirna repertoire expansions  <cit> . hypothesis has been proposed that expansion of mirnas may contribute to the improvement of body-plan complexity  <cit> . whether similar scenario is also the case in plants is unknown. from the phylogenetic tree, it can be inferred that an expansion of mir159/ <dig> family genes might be commitment with the evolution of seed-bearing plants . recent studies have shown that both mir <dig> and mir <dig> play important roles in reproductive growth of flowering plants  <cit> , indicating their functional relatedness to the evolution of seed bearing in plants. it has been shown in both plants and animals that mirna repertoire encoded in the genome is in the dynamics of genesis and loss of mirna genes during evolution  <cit> . some new born mirna genes seem to be targetless and evolutionarily transient, likely to serve as resources for the selection of functional mirnas  <cit> . similarly, from the phylogenetic tree of mir159/ <dig> family, we found this ancient mirna family underwent dynamics of duplication and loss, through which clade or species-specific mirna gene subgroups have formed. specifically, during evolution clade-specific subgroups formed in the manner that specific members of the expanded gene family maintained in a given descendant clade were lost in sister clades. moreover, duplicated gene members maintained in one clade of plants, e.g. mir <dig> and mir <dig> in flowering plants, tend to diverge into subfunctionalized groups improving the complexity of mirna regulation. similarly, the three members of arabidopsis mir <dig>  which arose from more recent duplications, also diverged into genes with distinct expression patterns and possibly different functions  <cit> .

the acr mirnas are much more variable than the mir <dig> or mir <dig> , indicating different selection pressure imposed on the two mirnas on the same stem-loop. moreover, a small number of mir159/ <dig> genes  lost conservation of the loop-proximal part corresponding to the acrs of type  <dig>  since the correct processing of the loop-proximal mirna duplex is the prerequisite for the dicing of mir <dig> or mir <dig>  <cit> , the acr-lacking mir159/ <dig> might become pseudo genes unable to produce mature mirnas like the ath-mir159c, which can not be efficiently processed when transformed into plants  <cit> . alternatively, the expression of non-type- <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes might be highly spatio-temporal specific or inducible under specific conditions. since the non-type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes are rare and we did not find exact evidence that any species only keep non-type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> in their genomes, the non-type  <dig> mir159/ <dig> genes might derive from type  <dig> 

with regulatory roles in gene expression, expression of mirnas is also regulated delicately. many mirnas are expressed in specific population of cells dedicated to certain functions during development  <cit> . in animals, growing evidences suggest that mirna expression is not only regulated at transcriptional level but also at post-transcriptional level. the processing of specific pri-mirnas by the microprocessor is regulated via diverse mechanisms in various biological processes  <cit> . recently, selective stabilization of mirnas by 3'-terminal adenylation has been reported revealing post-dicing regulation of mirna abundance by synthesis and degradation homeostasis  <cit> . however, plant genomes do not possess genes encoding protein factors equivalent to drosha in animals, which is the rnase iii enzyme catalyzing pri- to pre-mirna cleavage  <cit> . question arises whether post-transcriptional mechanisms have also evolved in plants to control the expression of specific mirnas. variegated dependencies on mirna pathway components of mirna accumulations indicate that there might be mirna-specific regulations at post-transcriptional steps in plant mirna biogenesis and stability. for example, it has been reported that null or hypomorphic alleles of dcl <dig>  ago <dig>  serrate, drb <dig>  abh <dig> and cbp <dig> have different impact on the accumulation of distinct mirna subsets  <cit> . a family of exoribonucleases responsible for the degradation of plant mirnas is identified, indicating that mature mirnas can also be regulated through degradation in plants  <cit> . we found spatio-temporal specific shifts in the proportion of mirna products within mir159/ <dig> stem-loop precursors during development . expression analysis also showed selective up-regulation of mature mir159/ <dig> mirnas in sirna-deficient mutants of moss and flowering plants . these observations provide evidences for the evolution of mirna-specific post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in plants.

across the major clades of mir159/ <dig> genes , the post-transcriptional regulation of mirna production seems to be diverged. first, general proportions of mir159/ <dig> mature mirnas are distinct for the early-branching clades. moss mir159/ <dig> genes have pronounced expression in sp <dig> and sp <dig> mirnas. lycopod mir159/ <dig> genes produce acr mirnas in higher levels than mir159/ <dig> in normal state. the gymnosperm cycas rumphii mir <dig> produce three phased mirnas at comparable levels from 3' arm of the stem-loop precursor in leaves . in most cases, angiosperm mir <dig> and mir <dig> generate mir <dig> or mir <dig> as major products . second, genes from angiosperm major mir <dig> clade and major mir <dig> clade can have different proportions of mature mirnas in specific organs of the same plant . third, genes from different early-branching mir159/ <dig> clades have different responsiveness to the sirna deficiency in the mature mirna expressions . in addition, paralogues in one early-branching mir159/ <dig> clade also show differences in tissue-specific proportion of mature mirnas and responsiveness to sirna deficiency. for example, the proportion of ath-mir319a acr <dig> mirna is much higher in 5-week-old inflorescence than that of ath-mir319b . the paralogues of mir <dig> also showed distinct expressions in a.lyrata . in sirna deficiency mutants, acr <dig> mirna of ath-mir319a is up-regulated to much higher level than that of ath-mir319b . such differences in their expressions are consistent with the inferred phylogenetic distance and different tissue specific expression patterns of ath-mir319a and ath-mir319b reported recently  <cit>  . these observations suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of mir159/ <dig> may have specialized during evolution and can serve as another feature that could distinguish their subgroups.

in addition to the small rnas dedicated to endogenous gene regulation in normal developmental and physiological processes, e.g. mirna, tasirnas, various sirna pathways have evolved in plants and animals to harness transposons, antagonize infection of pathogens and respond to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . epigenetic inactivation of transposons and exogenous dnas mediated by approximately 24-nt sirnas require the action of dcl <dig> and rdr <dig> for their biogenesis and ago <dig> in effecter complex  <cit> . dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and rdr <dig> are involved in the production of 21~22-nt sirnas from virus and a.tumefaciens t-dna, which mediate post-transcriptional silencing of pathogen-derived genes  <cit> . selective up-regulation of mir159/ <dig> acr mirnas in rdr <dig> and dcl <dig> dcl <dig> dcl <dig> triple mutants indicates that intrinsic link between mirna and the defensive sirna pathways has evolved in plants . mutation of the gene encoding rdr <dig> can cause global changes in small rna transcriptome and gene expressions including reduction of 24-nt heterochromatic sirna, enrichment of mirna and tasirnas, reactivation of specific type of transposons and altered expression of genes in chromatin modification pathways  <cit> . some of the mirnas are up-regulated much higher above the overall enrichment of mirnas in rdr <dig> mutants, such as the mir <dig> in a.thaliana  <cit> . the up-regulations of mir159/ <dig> mirnas in rdr <dig> or dcl <dig> triple mutants are very similar to these cases. however, the up-regulations of mir159/ <dig> mirnas are of strong selectivity upon the small rna products from the same stem-loop suggesting that it is unlikely to be a non-specific process . it was speculated that the different accumulation levels of mirnas in wild type and rdr <dig> mutants are caused by a secondary level of control by a sirna-mediated pathway, which depends on rdr2/mop <dig>  <cit> . likewise, the acr mirna accumulation of mir <dig> genes might be downstream of rdr2-dependent sirna regulation. since only acr mirnas are induced to high levels while increment of mir <dig> is similar to the overall enrichment of mirnas in rdr <dig> or dcl <dig> triple mutants, a post-transcriptional mechanism may distinguish the two mirna duplexes on the same stem-loop and link the sirna pathway. because the selective up-regulation of mir159/ <dig> genes is observed in both monocot and eudicots, the regulatory link between mir159/ <dig> genes and sirna pathway may have an ancient origin. it has been found in physcomitrella patens that silencing of mirna targets via dna methylation occurs in ppdclb mutants and aba treated wild type plants  <cit> . this suggests that silencing mechanisms of the heterochromatic sirna pathway can also be exploited by the mirna pathway. our findings revealed another layer of interactions between the two small rna pathways that production of mirna can be affected by defects in heterochromatic sirna pathway.

this uncharacterized mechanism controlling mature product proportion of mir159/ <dig> genes is distinguished from those previously found in animals in that multiple mature products from a single mirna stem-loop precursor can be selectively expressed in different situations. pare data suggest that speed for dicing at the steps during phased processing might be regulated, provided that detection of more intermediate products can serve as the signal for higher dicing speed for the corresponding step of slicing. accumulations of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are insensitive to decreased dcl <dig> activity unlike other mirnas such as mir <dig>  indicative of alternative dicer activity for the processing of these mirnas  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that only processing by alternative factors yields abundant acr mirnas but less mir159/ <dig> when alternative activity overrides the canonical. similar scenarios are possible for other factors involved in mirna biogenesis and activity, dysfunction of which affect mir <dig> in a mild way. for example, the abh <dig> is required for the processing of some pri-mirnas but not mir <dig>  <cit> . alternatively, since the theoretical ratio of acr mirna to mir <dig> or mir <dig> should be one, the variable proportion of mir159/ <dig> mature products could be resulted from regulation of mature mirna stability. probably, which of the mir159/ <dig> mature mirnas are incorporated into the risc and stabilized is tunable. since the acr <dig> mirna has been shown to associate with ago <dig>  <cit> , incorporation of acr <dig> mirna into ago <dig> might be tremendously increased in the rdr <dig> or dcl <dig> mutants, of which the ago <dig> associated sirnas are depleted  <cit> . increased ago <dig> up-regulates mir <dig> accumulation indicating excessive mir <dig> might be subjected to active degradation  <cit> . likewise, it is possible that the acr mirnas might be directly degraded in normal state but stabilized under specific circumstances. this kind of regulation has been reported for a class of 21-nt endogenous sirnas derived from mrnas, which accumulated only in the absence of ein <dig>  a 5'-3' exoribonuclease  <cit> . possibly, degradation of processing intermediates could be another way through which maturation of mirna is regulated. some mirna processing intermediates are up-regulated in exosome-deficient mutants, including the loop fragment of mir <dig>  <cit> . since mir159/ <dig> precursors are processed in a phased manner, differential exosome-mediated degradation of the intermediates might result in variable product proportions. a combined regulation at multiple steps of mirna metabolic cycle can not be ruled out. in addition to the unexpected up-regulation of acr mirnas, we also observed some cases of higher expression of mir319* than mir <dig>  namely a shift in strand selection . the change in strand bias of mir <dig> and mir159* have been observed in drb <dig> mutant plants, which direct strand selection of mirna duplexes  <cit> . possibly, the spatial-temporal specific selection of strands in mirna duplexes might be resulted from incongruent expressions of the mirna and drb <dig> 

the switching on of the acr mirnas in specific tissues and their responsiveness to sirna deficiency suggests that these mirnas might be functional. there is only one experimentally verified example that osa-mir159a acr <dig> mirna induces site-specific cleavage of an mrna encoding a gt-2-like transcription factor in rice  <cit> . however, it can not be excluded that the mir159/ <dig> acr mirnas may exert their function over their targets through other mechanisms such as translational repression or rna mediated dna methylation  <cit> . in light of the intra-stem-loop regulation, the phased loop-to-base processing of mir159/ <dig> stem-loop precursors may have evolved as framework for the tunable mature mirna production.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we showed that mir159/ <dig> genes with two conserved duplexes in their stem-loops distribute throughout land plants and constitute the most plentiful type classified by conservation pattern. together with phylogenetic reconstruction and mature mirna expression analysis, evidences support that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> have a common origin. evolution history of this gene family was revealed that the two clades containing the mir <dig> and mir <dig> founding members identified in a.thaliana are specific to flowering plants and originated from duplications occurring before the split of gymnosperm and angiosperms. interestingly, post-transcriptional regulation of multiple mature mirnas from some genes of mir159/ <dig> family has evolved, through which proportion of mature mir159/ <dig> mirnas can be changed in a spatio-temporal specific manner or in response to sirna pathway deficiency. these findings provide explanation for the conserved phased loop-to-base processing of mir159/ <dig> genes as framework for post-transcriptionally regulated expressions of their mature mirnas. taken together, our study provides insights on the evolution of mir159/ <dig> genes and an unexplored feature of them that the expressions of multiple forms of mature products are post-transcriptionally regulated.
