BACKGROUND
directed cell migration is a pivotal process for normal development and morphogenesis of most animals, wound healing, tissue renewal, immune responses, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis  <cit> . during these processes, cells are subjected to stress and increased energy demands. a growing body of evidence suggests that a newly discovered form of intercellular communication referred to as “intercellular bridges” or “tunneling nanotubes” and “tunneling tubes”  contributes to cell movement  and provides means for energy supply to the remote cells by transporting atp and even mitochondria . basically, tts form when filopodial or lamellipodial protrusions from one cell attach to the target cell or during dislodgement of abutted cells  <cit> . in these ways, remote cells can establish open-ended, close-ended, or gap junction -based communication. tts have been shown to be implicated in the intercellular electrical coupling and ca2+ flux; transfer of organelles or proteins; virus, pathogenic prion, and protein transmission; cell migration; and bacteria capture .

recently, it has been proposed that connexins , in addition to their canonical function of composing gjs, play a channel-independent role in cell adhesion, migration, division, differentiation, and tumorigenicity . among  <dig> isoforms of cxs found in the human genome, the role of only cx <dig>  cx <dig> , cx <dig>  and cx <dig> in these processes has been described in the scientific literature so far  <cit> . it has been shown that cx <dig> inhibits cell migration by altering the distribution of actin filaments; cx <dig>  decreases cell proliferation, delays the cell cycle at the g <dig> phase, and decreases migration and invasion of lung cancer cells; cx <dig> increases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; cx <dig> increases cell migration, induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and reduces cell proliferation. cxs interacting with cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins  <cit>  contribute to the regulation of cell migration, directed outgrowing of filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions , and intercellular communication through tts  <cit> .

eleven isoforms of cxs have been identified in the nervous system where they can play an important role in the directed migration of cells, formation of neural processes, and progression of brain tumors  <cit> . astrocytes express high levels of cxs and can couple to neurons and oligodendrocytes. astrocyte dysfunction may cause neuroautoimmune diseases, neoplasms, and epilepsy  <cit> . neuronal processes share structural and functional similarities with tts, and the directed formation of tts between developing neurons and astrocytes has been demonstrated  <cit> . cx <dig> accumulation at the tips of filopodium-like structures of astrocytes  <cit>  may cause more frequent filopodium formation  <cit> , stabilization of the leading edge protrusions in neuronal cells  <cit> , and biological molecule transmission via tt-like structures  <cit> . thus, tts and gjs in the brain are likely to facilitate the intercellular exchange of materials and possibly genetic information. the last may be of particular importance in determining the stem cell differentiation, cancer invasion, and metastasis. the role of cxs in cancer is controversial as well as tissue- and cancer stage-specific. reduced cx expression, or redistribution from the membrane to the cytoplasm, has been documented in a variety of cancers, including colon, lung, ovarian, breast, endometrial, and renal cell carcinomas and sarcomas, gliomas as well as in pre-cancerous tissues such as that of cervix. up-regulated cx expression has also been frequently described, and examples include breast cancer, skin cancers and various squamous cell carcinomas, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. even within the same tumor type, both increased and decreased cx expression can be found . in gliomas, a decrease in cx <dig> expression is associated with increasing proliferation and a higher tumor grade, but low-grade gliomas  show increased levels of cx <dig> . gj intercellular communication between glioma cells and endothelial cells is also thought to play a critical role in glioma invasion. up-regulation of cx <dig> in micrometastases of breast cancer appears to facilitate their attachment to the pulmonary endothelium  <cit> . thus, it looks like that cx down-regulation facilitates cancer cell escape from solid tumors, while up-regulation promotes the formation of metastasis.

valiūnas and colleagues  <cit>  have demonstrated that small rnas may be delivered through gjs composed of cx <dig> but not of cx <dig> or cx <dig> in hela, mβ16tsa , and human mesenchymal stem cells. also, gj-dependent transfer of si/mirnas has been shown to occur between primary cardiac myocytes  <cit> ; human cardiac stem cells and postmitotic myocytes  <cit> ; bone marrow stromal and breast cancer cells  <cit> ; glioma cells  <cit> ; glioma stem cells and mscs  <cit> . it is assumed that transfer of small rnas with high molecular weight via gjs is possible due to rod-shaped morphology of sirnas, a diameter of which allows their passage through gjs with larger pores  <cit> . however, the transfer of sirnas between abutted cells through gjs is under debate so far due to experimental difficulties to reject the pinocytotic pathway of transfer  <cit> . our previous study was the first that demonstrated the transfer of double stranded sirna between remote human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma  cells through open-ended and even through cx <dig> gj-containing tts  <cit> .

in the present study, we used the hela cell model to examine the impact of neural cxs  on the following: 1) cell mobility; 2) formation and properties of tts; and 3) transfer of sirna between remote cells through tts.

RESULTS
general properties of tts between hela cells
to examine the impact of different cx expression on tt morphology, hela cells were stably transfected with cx36-egfp, cx40-cfp, cx43-egfp, cx <dig>  or cx <dig>  non-transfected hela wt cells were used as control. we found that hela cells, either wt or expressing different cxs, in the culture formed intercellular tts of various width  and length . time-lapse imaging revealed highly dynamic formation of filopodium-like tts that were identified as not touching the substratum . the diameter of the thinnest tts  could not be measured precisely by conventional optical microscopy as well as their electrical and permeability properties could not be examined due to a short lifetime .fig.  <dig> formation of tts between hela cells. a-c tts formed by the filopodium outgrowth mechanism. d-f tts formed in the process of cell division and successive dislodgment or by the lamellipodium outgrowth mechanism. in both the cases, the pictures represent the top view of cells at a different focus a and b; d and e) and z-x reconstruction showing tts raised above the substratum 



much thicker tts  formed during cell division and subsequent dislodgment or by the lamellipodium outgrowth mechanism. these tts also were found raised above the substratum  and were involved in cargo transport either inside the tts or along their outer surface . however, the leading edges of lamellipodium extensions were usually attached to the substratum and participated in cell motility and tt formation. the lifetime of these tts lasted tens of minutes and even hours and allowed to use the dual whole-cell patch-clamp technique and fluorescence microscopy for characterization of their formation and properties.

hela cells grown to confluence on the glass coverslips formed numerous gj plaques that can be visible due to chimeric fluorescent proteins . as it was demonstrated before, abutted hela cells expressing cxs used in the current study formed functional gjs permeable to fluorescent dyes of different molecular weight and net charge . in contrast, abutted hela wt cells did not exhibit any electrical coupling or dye transfer between cells.fig.  <dig> types of tts formed between hela cells. a and b a typical view of cx43-egfp- and cx36-egfp-expressing hela cells, respectively, exhibiting multiple fluorescent gj plaques. c and d only f-actin-containing f-tts. e and f f-actin- and α-tubulin-containing fα-tts.  tts formed gjs at the cx-expressing cell border 



however, in this study, the cells were grown at relatively low density and fluorescently tagged proteins helped us confirm the presence and site of gj plaques in the tt in addition to electrical measurements. we identified two types of tts between wt or different cx-expressing hela cells: tts containing only f-actin   and those containing f-actin and α-tubulin  . the cells were labeled with phalloidin and anti-α-tubulin to visualize the actin network and microtubules, respectively. hela cells on average formed  <dig> and 83 % of f-tts and fα-tts, respectively, and this proportion was not affected by cxs expression. cells expressing different cxs formed tts with clusters of respective cxs at the membrane interface with the remote cell .

the electrical properties of tts were examined by the dual whole-cell patch-clamp technique . hela cells formed functional gj-containing tts independent on the isoform of expressed cx as confirmed by the measurement of voltage gating typical of gjs. electrical coupling and voltage gating were estimated by applying 30-s voltage ramps from  <dig> to −120 mv in the cell- <dig>  and measuring the current response in the cell- <dig> . gt-vt dependences  were calculated from it responses to the vt ramps shown in fig. 4b. fig. 4d and table  <dig> show that gt strongly depended on the single channel conductance of the expressed cx . interestingly, gt of open-ended tts between hela wt cells was smaller than that between particular cx-expressing cells. these tts did not distinguish as having the highest conductance presumably because during cell dislodgment in the process of cytokinesis, open-ended tts rapidly turn into close-ended ones  before they rupture. this observation supports the significance of gjs in determining the strength of communication between cells. in cx-transfected cells, the ratio of close-ended, open-ended, and gj-containing tts did not depend on the cx type and was ~1:2: <dig> . in rare cases, tts between cx-expressing hela cells did not couple the cells electrically for  <dig> possible reasons: 1) tts were close-ended; 2) gj-dependent electrical coupling was not established yet in the process of de novo formation of tt; and 3) gj-dependent electrical coupling was already lost due to cell separation.fig.  <dig> characterization of electrical properties of tts formed between hela wt and cx36-egfp-, cx40-cfp-, cx43-egfp-, cx45-, and cx47-expressing cells. a the tt connecting a pair of hela cx <dig> cells. b electrical properties of tts were evaluated by applying a voltage ramp of negative polarity from  <dig> to −120 mv  to the cell- <dig> and measuring junctional current in the cell- <dig> ; c typical gt-vt dependences of open-ended  and gj-containing  tts calculated from it responses to vt ramps shown in  with their symmetric counterparts. d summary of conductances of tts between hela wt and different cx-expressing cells . *p <  <dig> 



in general, gt should at least in part depend directly on tt width  and inversely on tt length ; however, in our experiments gt only moderately correlated with tt geometry suggesting that the total conductance of tts is more complex. for instance, gt strongly depends on the number of functional gj channels that are not related to tt geometry and size of gj plaques  <cit> . also, not the external diameter of the tt, but the internal one, is a gt-limiting factor, and unfortunately, there are no means for estimation of its dimensions.

the impact of different connexins on the mobility of hela cells
the mobility properties of different cx-expressing hela cells were examined by the wound healing assay . occupation of the scraped area by cx36-egfp- and cx40-cfp-expressing cells was faster compared with wt or cx43-egfp-, cx45-, and cx47-expressing cells; however, there was no statistically significant difference between wt and cx43-egfp-, cx45-, or cx47-expressing cells. the percentage of the occupied scraped area after 12 h was as follows: in hela wt,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %; hela cx36-egfp,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %; hela cx40-cfp,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %; hela cx43-egfp,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %; hela cx <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  %; and in hela cx <dig> cells,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> evaluation of mobility properties of different cx-expressing hela cells by the wound healing assay. a the representative pictures of wound healing in hela wt and hela cx36-egfp cell monolayers at different time points . b the percentage of the scraped area occupied 12 h after wound formation in different cx-expressing hela cell monolayers . *p <  <dig>  compared with hela wt cells



cx isoform-specific permeability of tts to sirna
previously, we have reported that small rnas  were capable of transiting between lscc cells through open-ended and cx <dig> gj-containing tts. in this study, we examined whether tts containing gjs composed of different neural cxs were permeable to sirna using the same approach as described previously  <cit> . to measure tt permeability, the pipette- <dig> containing sirna/af <dig>  was attached to the cell- <dig>  and after opening the patch, sirna diffused to the cell- <dig> followed by its transfer or not through the tt to the cell- <dig> . typically, accumulation of sirna/af <dig> in the cell- <dig> started after ~10 min delay compared with cell- <dig>  the total permeability of tt, pt, was evaluated using equation  <dig>  which accounted for changes in fluorescence intensity in the cell- <dig>  and the cell- <dig> . at the end of sirna transfer measurement, the patch in the cell- <dig> was opened to measure gt and gt-vt.fig.  <dig> sirna transfer through tts between different cx-expressing hela cells. a a pair of cx45-expressing hela cells connected through the tt. b sirna/af <dig>  introduced into the patch pipette entered the cell- <dig> after patch opening, spread along the tt but did not enter the remote cell- <dig>  c and d kinetics of sirna/af <dig> accumulation in the cell- <dig> and the cell- <dig>  respectively. gt measured at the end of the experiment was  <dig>  ns. arrows point to the moments of patch opening in the cell- <dig> and the cell- <dig>  e and f kinetics of af <dig> accumulation in the cell- <dig> and the cell- <dig>  respectively. g a pair of cx40-cfp-expressing hela cells connected through the tt. h after the patch was opened in the cell- <dig>  sirna/af <dig> entered the cell- <dig>  spread along the tt, and accumulated in the cell- <dig>  i and j kinetics of sirna/af <dig> accumulation in the cell- <dig> and the cell- <dig>  respectively. sirna/af <dig> accumulation in the cell- <dig> was arrested by octanol , a gj blocker. gt measured at the end of the experiment was  <dig> ns



as it is demonstrated in figs. 6a-d, tts between hela cells expressing cx <dig> and cx36-egfp were impermeable to sirna/af <dig> even though they exhibited substantial electrical coupling and permeability to af <dig> . however, tts containing cx40-cfp, cx43-egfp, and cx <dig> gjs as well as open-ended tts between non-transfected hela wt cells were permeable to sirna/af <dig> .

discussion
agnati and his colleagues in their elegant review divided the intercellular communication in the brain into two main modes: wiring transmission  and volume transmission   <cit> . however, both these modes can be encompassed by tts that connect cells over long distances by establishing open-ended , close-ended , or gj-based connections. in such a way, tts are implicated in intercellular electrical and metabolic coupling as well as transfer of vesicles, proteins, organelles, and even genetic material. all these processes are involved not only in the normal functioning of the brain but also in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. our recent study has demonstrated that tts containing cx <dig> gjs were capable of transferring sirna/af <dig>  <cit>  and raised a question whether tts containing gjs composed of other neural cxs are permeable to it. in parallel, we evaluated a gj channel- and hemichannel-independent impact of the same cxs on hela cell migration and development of tts.

the novelty and main findings of the current study are the following: 1) cx36-egfp promotes while cx43-egfp, cx <dig>  and especially cx <dig> inhibit the formation of tts between hela cells; 2) cx36-egfp- and cx40-cfp-expressing hela cells demonstrate better mobility properties; 3) tts containing cx40-cfp, cx43-egfp, and cx <dig> are permeable while containing cx36-egfp and cx <dig> are not permeable to sirnas.

as it is seen from table  <dig>  the conductance of gj-containing tts depended on the type of the expressed cx, i.e. cxs with higher single channel conductance ) determined the higher conductance of the tt assuming that the number of channels in the gj plaque-containing tts was alike in all cases since tt geometry was not affected by the type of the expressed cx. open-ended tts of hela wt cells did not distinguish by the highest conductance, presumably because open-ended tts rapidly turn into close-ended during cell dislodgment in the process of cytokinesis . this observation supports the role of gjs in determining the strength of communication between remote cells connected through tts.

one of the steps in the cell motility cycle is integrin-dependent adhesion to the substrate  <cit> . our observation that cxs localize on the tips of lamellipodium-like protrusions and at their contact with the remote cell suggests that cxs may interact with cellular adhesion and tight junctional proteins of other cells. for instance, cx <dig> has been shown to exert effects on migration by interfering with receptor signaling, cytoskeleton remodeling, and tubulin dynamics  <cit> ; in the developing brain, cx <dig> adhesion-promoting properties facilitate the migration of pyramidal cell precursors from the ventricular zone toward the ventricular plate  <cit> . also, the expression of cx <dig> inversely correlated with the migration rate in the culture of canine brain tumor cells  <cit> . similarly, in our study, cx43-egfp- as well as cx45- and cx47-expressing hela cells demonstrated tendency to reduced mobility compared with hela wt cells . interestingly, cells expressing the same cxs exhibited reduced formation of tts while cx36-egfp-expressing cells formed the largest number of tts and demonstrated the highest mobility ; cx40-cfp increased cell mobility but tt formation did not differ from that in hela wt cells. these observations suggest that cell mobility and tt formation may be regulated through different mechanisms that may be controlled by different cxs in an opposite manner.

the cx isoform-specific permeability of tts to sirna/af <dig> suggests that gjs may play an important role in forming the limiting barrier of genetic material transfer through homotypic and heterotypic homocellular and heterocellular connections. tts containing gjs composed of cxs with the lowest single channel conductances  were impermeable to sirna/af488; however, they both were permeable to af <dig> . the differences in permeability could be determined by different diameters of gj pores and by distribution of fixed charge sites in the pore. the main factor that can facilitate the effective permeability of genetic material is rod-shaped morphology of a sirna molecule  <cit> . also, it is worth noting that sirna transfer is not a simple process of diffusion but rather energy-dependent, motor protein-involving transportation. for instance, kinesin and dynein have been shown to be motor proteins associated with microtubule transport  <cit>  that can be blocked by azide, an inhibitor of atp synthesis  <cit> . this assumption stays in line with our observation that gt and pt of sirna did not correlate either among cxs with different single channel conductances  or in the single cx series of experiments.

epithelial-to-mesenchymal and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions play crucial roles in cancer metastasis, and these processes can be controlled and reversed by mirnas  <cit> . the known pathways of mirna transfer between cells are the following: extracellular vesicles ; circulating rna in a vesicle-independent form; synapses; gjs and tts  <cit> . the last pathway would be the most swift and efficient; however, it still is not definitely proven. a general view that cxs are down-regulated in cancer cells needs to be revised because many studies including our own  <cit>  have demonstrate the presence of cxs and gjs in tumor tissues. even though epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is associated with cx down-regulation or loss of communication through gjs between cells that communicate normally , mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition is related to the up-regulation of cx expression and acquisition of novel gj-based communication between cell types that do not communicate in healthy tissue  . for instance, in glioma cell populations, the over-expression of cxs and gjs between tumor and non-tumor glia cells facilitates the invasion of glioma cells  <cit> . the expression of cx <dig> in the glioma core is very heterogeneous: cx expression is restricted to minor populations of cells endowed with invasive and cancer stem cell-like properties and able to migrate, but other cells non-expressing cx <dig> are able to proliferate  <cit> . migrating glioma cells expressing cx <dig> may then be able to induce the development of secondary or recurrent gliomas with gjs  <cit> . cx <dig> expression is increased in breast cancer cells predestined to spread to the brain  <cit> . disseminating breast cancer or melanoma cells migrate along the luminal surface searching for suitable sites to extravasate and form functional gjs  with brain endothelial and/or glial cells to initiate brain metastasis, and first lesions develop in cx-rich vasculature and stroma of the brain  <cit> . recent studies have suggested the involvement of mirna in coordination of the gene expression program determining tumor metastasis  <cit> . delivery of mirna to remote cells can be facilitated by open-ended or gj-containing tts. the first evidence of the effectiveness of gj-dependent pathway was provided by valiunas and colleagues, who demonstrated that sirna delivered through gjs down-regulated a reporter gene in the recipient cell  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate a new modulatory effect of different neural cxs on cell migration, tt formation, and permeability to sirna. these results may contribute to the knowledge about mechanisms of cancer invasion and metastasis.
