BACKGROUND
ribose-5-phosphate isomerases catalyze the interconversion of ribulose-5-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate as an important part of the pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . ribose-5-phosphate is used in nucleotide and co-factor biosynthesis. as with other isomerases, ribose-5-phosphate catalyzes this reaction at near equilibrium. two types of ribose-5-phosphate isomerases exist, rpia and rpib, which share little structural homology and have distinct active sites and mechanisms of action  <cit> . most organisms such as escherichia coli contain both rpia and rpib, but other organisms contain only one class of rpi. in e. coli, a double rpia/rpib knockout exhibited severely impaired growth  <cit> . rpib occurs almost exclusively in bacteria.

rpib is a member of the lacab_rpib superfamily of proteins . rpib from different organisms may have different substrate specificities and several annotated rpib enzymes act upon allose-5-phosphate rather than or in addition to ribose-5-phosphate and are thus named alsi. indeed, one of the first crystal structures solved for a member of this family was the e. coli rpib/alsi  <cit> . given the important cellular role of ribose-5-phosphate isomerases and that mammals only have rpia, interest has been generated in rpib enzymes as potential drug targets, especially in pathogenic organisms, many of which only have rpib. e. coli rpib inhibitors have been described  <cit>  and inhibitor-bound crystal structures have been determined for rpib from mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit>  which causes tuberculosis and trypanosma cruzi  <cit> , the causative agent of trypanosomiasis.

coccidioides immitis is a pathogenic fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever  <cit> . one gene  encodes a putative uncharacterized protein that contains high sequence homology with rpib enzymes from closely related organisms. specifically, the cimg_ <dig> gene product contains 98% sequence identity to an rpi from c. posadasii, 89% sequence identity to an rpi from the non-pathogenic fungus uncinocarpus reesii, and 78% sequence identity to an rpib from paracoccidioides brasiliensis. we have undertaken structural analysis of rpib from c. immitis and present here crystal structures in apo and ligand bound forms.

RESULTS
structure determination of c. immitis rpib
given that the c. immitis rpib contains modest sequence identity to other structurally characterized rpibs, we attempted to solve the crystal structure of c. immitis rpib by iodide ion single wavelength anomalous dispersion  phasing  <cit> , a strategy that has proven successful for structure determination of many ssgcid targets  <cit> . attempts at phasing entirely with sad resulted in poor quality experimental phases . attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement with other rpibs such as that from clostridium thermocellum  <cit>  yielded clear rotation and translation solutions, yet poor refinement statistics . addition of the mr solution to a sad experiment has been shown in improve phase quality  <cit> . therefore the partial molecular replacement solution was combined with the sad phases and yielded a clearly interpretable electron density map  into which buccaneer  <cit>  built both molecules in the asymmetric unit end-to-end in less than one minute .

rfree = Σh||fobs| - |fcalc||/Σh|fobs|. values in parenthesis indicate the values for the highest of twenty resolution shells

rfree was calculated using 5% of the reflections omitted from the refinement  <cit> .

interestingly, the active site contains electron density consistent with an oxidized cysteine residue  in both protomers . although the exact oxidation state of the cysteine residue was not determined, the electron density maps were most consistent with two conformations of the sulfenic state rather than sulfinic or sulfonic acid. the oxygen on cys <dig> appears to adopt two different orientations contacting the backbone nitrogen and side chain hydroxyl of thr <dig> in one orientation and the backbone nitrogens of gly <dig> and val <dig> in the other. the oxidized nature of cys <dig> may imply that this residue, thought to be the catalytic base, is highly reactive. the high concentration solution of sodium iodide used for phasing likely contains iodine, indicated by a light yellow color. iodine is the most probable source for the oxidation of cys <dig>  which was not oxidized in the other two c. immitis rpib structures . oxidation is unlikely to have occurred as a result of radiation damage since the data were collected in house under cryogenic temperatures. oxidized cysteines have been observed previously in the presence of iodide ions  <cit>  and also for other rpib enzymes  determined in the absence of iodide.

comparison with other ribose-5-phosphate isomerases
the c. immitis rpib contains ~20-38% sequence identity with other structurally characterized rpib enzymes, although fewer than  <dig> amino acids are completely conserved across these sequences . the overall structure of the c. immitis putative rpib is quite similar to other structurally characterized rpib enzymes from bacterial as well as eukaryotic organisms . in addition to the conserved overall fold, certain other rpib features are present in the c. immitis rpib structure such as the highly conserved cis-peptide at residue gly <dig> 

superposition calculations were done in ccp <dig> using the program superposition and the secondary structure matching setting. the number of similar cα atoms  is reported. for pdb entries 3c5y , 2ppw , 3ono  and 3s5p  no primary citation has been reported.

the c. immitis rpib contains the canonical open  rossman fold, a common fold for proteins that bind nucleotides or nucleotide-like molecules  <cit> . as determined by the protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies  server  <cit> , the quaternary structure appears to be dimeric  with  <dig> Å <dig> of buried surface . however, based on the structure, pisa also predicts a tetrameric structure  in which  <dig>  Å <dig> of surface area is buried . the tetrameric structure of c. immitis rpib is most likely a dimer of dimers with one strong dimer and the secondary weaker dimer interaction that makes the tetramer. this quaternary structure is consistent with the two ligand bound c. immitis rpib described below in a different crystal form, and with previous x-ray structural characterization of rpib, such as that from e. coli  <cit> . dynamic light scattering  experiments indicated a monodisperse protein with an approximate molecular weight of  <dig> kda which is consistent with a tetramer in solution. dls measurement on e. coli rpib also indicated a tetramer in solution  <cit> . thermofluor analysis indicated a stable protein with a melting temperature of 52°c. the melting temperature was unaffected by the presence of ribose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate with mncl <dig>  or iodoacetate.

c. immitis rpib substrate recognition
structures of rpib from other organisms have been obtained in the presence of ribose-5-phosphate or inhibitors. comparison of the active site in multiple sequence alignments showed that several residues involved in recognition of the phosphate moiety of ribose-5-phosphate or ribulose-5-phosphate are not conserved in c. immitis rpib . while other organisms use up to five positively charged residues to recognized the phosphate moiety, only one of these residues is positively charged  in c. immitis. several other residues are small polar residues such as ser <dig> and ser <dig>  residue  <dig> is typically a histidine or asparagine, but is surprisingly a negatively charged aspartic acid residue in c. immitis. because of the decreased size of several residues and the presence of asp <dig>  we speculated that the c. immitis rpib may utilize a cation to facilitate recognition of ribose-5-phosphate. rpib enzymes from other organisms typically recognize ribose-5-phosphate with a low affinity of km ~ 1- <dig> mm  <cit> . therefore, we performed co-crystallization experiments in the presence of  <dig> mm ribose-5-phosphate or  <dig> mm ribose-5-phosphate with  <dig> mm mncl <dig>  which are in excess of the protein . we obtained a  <dig>  Å resolution data set  from c. immitis rpib co-crystallized in the presence of  <dig> mm ribose-5-phosphate and  <dig> mm mncl <dig>  despite the presence of  <dig> mm substrate, we only observed substantial electron density for phosphate bound in the active site, which presumably came from the  <dig>  m spg buffer  buffer at ph  <dig>  . therefore, it appears that under the conditions of the crystallization experiment, phosphate outcompeted ribose-5-phosphate for binding to the active site. addition electron density extends from one of the oxygens of the phosphate. the crystal may contain a mixture of phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate, which could be modeled into the active site without significant steric clash. refinement of ribose-5-phosphate alone or at  <dig>  occupancy with phosphate as the other  <dig>  occupancy resulted in negative density in the |fo|-|fc| electron density map and high crystallographic b-factors for ribose-5-phosphate. therefore, the final model contains only phosphate. phosphate is recognized by ser <dig>  ser <dig> and lys <dig> of the active site. some of the negative charge may be stabilized via charge relay from ser <dig> to arg <dig>  in other organisms, arg <dig> is a leucine or methionine . the positioning of the phosphate moiety is slightly different than that observed in other structures, such as that of t. cruzi rpib bound to the competitive inhibitor 4-deoxy-4-phospho-d-erythronohydroxamic acid  <cit>  .

given the substantial differences in the active site of the c. immitis rpib in comparison with other structurally and functionally characterized rpib enzymes, it is possible that the c. immitis enzyme utilizes a substrate different than ribose-5-phosphate/ribulose-5-phosphate. in addition to the single positively charged residue that interacts with the phosphate, the highly conserved histidine involved in ring opening in the catalytic mechanism  has been replaced with ser109" in the c. immitis structure . given the position of the phosphate in the c. immitis structure, we suspect that this enzyme may isomerize shorter chain substrates, although confirmation of substrate activity will require further structural and biochemical characterization. furthermore, c. immitis contains another gene  that encodes a putative uncharacterized protein which contains 99% sequence identity to rpia from c. posadasii . therefore, this essential function of the pentose phosphate pathway may be accomplished by rpia, allowing rpib to have evolved with an altered substrate specificity.

c. immitis rpib covalent inhibition
the catalytic cysteine residue of rpib is known to be reactive toward iodoacetate  <cit> , although no crystal structure has been determined for an rpib covalently bound to iodoacetate. attempts at co-crystallization after incubation with  <dig> mm iodoacetamide did not yield diffraction quality crystals. however, a  <dig>  Å resolution data set was obtained from a crystal grown from mib buffer  at ph  <dig>  which contained clear evidence for malonic acid tightly bound off cys <dig> . the malonic acid refines with a c2-s distance of  <dig>  Å, which is longer than that expected for a covalent c-s bond , but significantly shorter than that expected for van der waals interactions ; malonic acid was built into the omit |fo|-|fc| density and allowed to refine freely in refmac <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this structure may reflect the formation of a distorted  covalent bond between malonic acid and cys <dig>  we do not know of a reasonable mechanism for the formation of such a covalent bond between malonic acid and cys <dig>  which rather seems counterintuitive.

the chemical reaction of cys <dig> with iodoacetate is expected to form a cys-ch2cooh adduct. the conformation of either of the carboxylates of malonic acid may be reflective of the carboxylate of the covalent adduct formed with iodoacetate. one of the carboxylates of malonic acid forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of thr <dig>  and the universally conserved gly <dig>  as well as the side chain of the universally conserved asp <dig> . the hydrogen bond with asp <dig> is unlikely to occur at neutral ph where both carboxylates are expected to be deprotonated and negatively charged. in contrast, the interaction is well ordered in the ph  <dig>  crystal. given an approximate pka of ~ <dig> , at ph  <dig>  about half of the carboxylates should be protonated. the second malonic acid carboxylate forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone amide nitrogen of the universally conserved gly <dig>  and with the side chain of the universally conserved asn110' of the other protomer of the obligate dimeric enzyme . the interactions of this carboxylate with rpib may reflect the interactions formed by the iodoacetate covalent adduct. there is a chloride ion in the active site  <dig>  Å away from the malonic acid and near arg105' and arg <dig>  although this anion is ill-suited to mimic the iodide ion leaving group of iodoacetate because it is on the opposite side of the caboxylate relative to cys <dig>  an iodide ion resides in the same place as this chloride ion in both protomers of the asymmetric unit in the iodide-phased structure.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present crystal structures of rpib from the pathogenic fungus c. immitis, which together with the structures from t. cruzi  <cit>  and g. lamblia  are the only eukaryotic rpib crystal structures currently available. these structures reveal the presence of a highly reactive cysteine residue in the active site, thought to be the catalytic base in the isomerase reaction and provide insight into a possible structural mechanism for the inhibition of rpib by iodoacetate. furthermore, these structures reveal the basis for phosphate recognition by a single positively charged residue and may indicate that this c. immitis has altered substrate specificity.
