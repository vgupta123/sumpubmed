BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding regulatory rnas that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. mature mirnas are often conserved across a wide range of species, and mutations in proteins required for mirna function or biogenesis have shown to impair animal development
 <cit> . they are involved in the majority of physiological processes, including stem cell differentiation, cell lineage specification, haematopoiesis, neurogenesis, immune response and myogenesis
 <cit> . mirna-mediated gene regulation involves binding to the 3’-utr of their mrna target and sequestration of mrna by the mirna/risc complex  in the cytoplasmic processing bodies, which results in repression of translation initiation or mrna degradation reviewed in
 <cit> .

in vertebrates, somatic and skeletal muscle growth is strongly stimulated by igf-i 
 <cit> , whose functions are mediated by the igf-i receptor  through activation of two major intracellular signalling pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinases  and mtor  through phosphatidylinositol  <dig> kinase /akt
 <cit> . mtor mediates signalling in response to nutrient availability, cellular energy, mitogenic signals and various types of stressors. phosphorylation of mtor increases levels of protein synthesis by regulating essential proteins controlling mrna translation. the mapk pathway is essential for muscle cell proliferation and differentiation
 <cit> , and the closely related hepatic insulin pathway acts upstream of akt/mtor. it recruits irs proteins, which in turn recruit pi3k to phosphorylate akt. downstream of akt, subsequent metabolic effects are largely mediated by mtor and also foxo1
 <cit> . mtor then regulates s6k <dig> and 4-ebp <dig> to induce hepatic protein synthesis and to stimulate lipogenesis
 <cit> .

the physiological actions of these complex pathways are multiple and several mirnas have already been identified as intervenients on their regulation. for instance, in human, mir-199a-3p and mir- <dig> can suppress gene expression by directly binding to the 3’-utr of mtor
 <cit> . furthermore, mir- <dig> regulates pten, the principal negative regulator of pi3k
 <cit> . mirnas that influence mtor and mapk pathways play crucial roles in myogenesis, since they are essential for muscle development and growth. for example, mir- <dig> is involved in myoblast differentiation and in establishing the muscle phenotype
 <cit> . additionally, some mirnas  are specifically expressed in muscle and positively related with its growth
 <cit> . interestingly, in teleost like zebrafish , fast muscle mirna populations are differentially regulated during the transition from hyperplastic to hypertrophic muscle phenotype in adult fish
 <cit> . also, the dynamic expression of mir- <dig>  mir-26a and mir- <dig> throughout skeletal muscle development in the common carp , points to an active role of these mirnas in the myogenic process
 <cit> .

mirnas can also modulate protein abundance and/or phosphorylation status of key signaling components of the insulin pathway. expression of mir-122
 <cit>  and mir-33
 <cit>  is inversely correlated with expression and/or phosphorylation status of the α-subunit of the metabolic sensor ampk. in fact, mir- <dig>  which is highly abundant in mammalian
 <cit>  and fish liver
 <cit> , exerts a stimulatory role on lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis, and inhibits fatty-acid oxidation and therefore energy production
 <cit> .

in fish, changes in mirna expression have been documented during early ontogeny
 <cit>  or in response to food ingestion
 <cit> . however, the potential effect of water temperature on the mirna transcriptome has never been investigated in teleosts, in spite of its profound impact on larval and juvenile growth
 <cit> . the flatfish senegalese sole  is a species of commercial interest for marine aquaculture, particularly in southern europe, and it can be exposed to large thermal variations in natural and aquaculture conditions
 <cit> . in a previous study it was shown that higher embryonic temperatures  promoted a faster development and increased the size of sole larvae by 30 days post hatch  relatively to a lower temperature 
 <cit> . furthermore, muscle cellularity at equivalent developmental stages was affected by temperature and a transient differential gene expression associated with incubation temperature was also observed at several stages. for example, myf <dig>  fst, myhc and mrf <dig> transcript levels were higher at 21°c compared to 15°c
 <cit> . it is likely that this differential expression of myogenic genes is regulated by mirnas to some extent but their role in thermal plasticity of development and growth remains to be investigated. hence, we have used the solid deep-sequencing platform to determine potential changes in the mirna transcriptome in senegalese sole embryos and larvae exposed to two different temperatures  during embryonic development. moreover, we have predicted targets of mirnas that were differentially expressed with temperature, in order to understand their potential role in the phenotypic plasticity of growth in teleosts.

RESULTS

to identify senegalese sole mirnas expressed during development,  <dig> small rna libraries were prepared and sequenced using the solid deep-sequencing platform. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> reads after sequence trimming. all small rna-seq data have been deposited in gene expression omnibus under the accession gse <dig>  after discarding rrnas, trnas and snornas,  <dig> conserved mirnas from  <dig> mirna families were identified . it is noteworthy that  <dig> of these mirnas had not been previously described in fish . read length distributions for each sample are shown in figure 
 <dig>  two peaks in read length were found for all samples, one at 22–23 nt and another around 28–29 nt, which correspond to mirnas/interfering mirnas and piwi-interacting rnas, respectively. the majority of reads were around the 22 nt peak, indicating mirna enriched samples . no novel mirnas were identified amongst the publicly available nucleotide sequences from senegalese sole.table  <dig>

differential expression of conserved mirnas during senegalese sole development and with embryonic temperature
hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> conserved mirnas found with solid sequencing in senegalese sole revealed three main clusters: mirnas with very low number of reads throughout development , mirnas generally highly expressed in all developmental stages  and mirnas with variable expression during development .mirna diversity and expression varied amongst developmental stages . notably, several passenger strands showed very high expression values in one or more stages of development, such as mir-122-5p, mir-140-3p, mir-181a-3p, mir-199a-3p or mir-203b-5p . generally, at earlier stages of development , there was less variety and lower level of mirna transcripts than at later stages . the mirna with highest number of reads during 75ep in both temperature groups was mir-430d  , followed by mir-430a and 430c. the mir- <dig> family was prominently expressed until hatching, but its expression decreased sharply after that and at metamorphosis hardly any expression could be detected . at 75ep, the passenger strands with the highest number of reads were mir-203b-5p, mir-202-5p and mir-20a-3p . during the 20s stage, mirnas such as mir-203a, mir-17a-5p or mir-130c were found to be highly expressed . at hatching, mir-130c was the mirna with the highest number of reads in both temperatures . at this point, mir-203a, mir- <dig>  mir-301c and mir-10d were also found in a large number of reads . other mirnas were also mostly observed after hatching, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and the let- <dig> family. during metamorphosis, mir- <dig> was the mirna with the highest number of reads in the 15°c group  and the second highest in the 21°c group . mir-130c, mir-125b-5p, mir-199a-5p and mir-181a-5p were also amongst the mirnas with highest expression at this stage . likewise, the passenger strands mir-122-5p, mir-199a-3p, mir-140-3p and mir-181a-3p were expressed at high levels during metamorphosis . furthermore, expression of some passenger and guide strands of the same mirna differed during development. for example, mir-122-5p and mir-140-3p were generally expressed at higher levels throughout development than their guide strands, mir-122-3p and mir-140-5p, respectively .the digital expression profiles obtained with solid sequencing in senegalese sole were validated by qpcr of selected mirnas . these mirnas were selected based on: 1) previous knowledge of their functions in other species, namely involvement in development and growth, muscle differentiation or response to stress, and 2) differential expression during development and/or temperature, as evidenced by the above solid sequencing results. quantification of selected mirnas was performed not only in the same samples used for solid sequencing but also in pre-metamorphic and  <dig> dph larvae . most mirnas analysed had the highest expression levels at the pre-metamorphosis stage , whilst mir-199-5p and mir-206-3p were preferentially expressed during metamorphosis .figure  <dig>

there were several significant differences in mirna expression between embryonic temperatures. mir-17a-5p, mir-26a, mir-130c and mir-206-3p transcripts were significantly higher at 21°c than at 15°c during 75ep  . at the 20s stage, mir-130c and mir-181a-3p showed a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher expression at 15°c than 21°c , respectively . at hatching, mir-17a-5p, mir-26a, mir-130c, mir-181a-5p, mir-199a-5p and mir-206-3p were highly expressed at 21°c compared to 15°c . no significantly differences between temperatures were found after hatching.

discussion
characterisation of senegalese sole mirnas
using high-throughput solid sequencing,  <dig> conserved mirna guide and passenger strands were identified and their expression profiles analysed in senegalese sole embryos and larvae subjected to two different incubation temperatures . there was some tendency to observe a higher number of conserved mirbase reads at later developmental stages and at a lower water temperature. this is unlikely to be a technical bias, since all libraries were prepared simultaneously and run on the same slide. instead, it reflects a dynamic mirna transcriptome throughout early ontogeny, which is influenced by environmental factors. from the  <dig> conserved mirnas,  <dig> were not previously found in fish but were known in mammals, birds or nematodes. up- or down-regulation of some of them is known to be involved in cancer-associated gene deregulation, namely mir-211
 <cit>  and mir-509
 <cit> . mir- <dig> mediates the effects of germ cell loss on life span, and its over-expression was found to extend the life span of caenorhabditis elegans lacking germ cells
 <cit> . most of these novel mirnas were found in more than one small rna library and were regulated, which indicates that they may play a key role in senegalese sole development. nevertheless, the specific functions of these mirnas in embryogenesis remain to be ascertained.

there is increasing evidence that mirnas that possess both highly conserved -5p and -3p sequences, especially within seed and anchor sequences, can originate two mature functional mirnas, such as the case of mir-18a, mir- <dig> or mir-17
 <cit> . in the present study, several passenger strands were expressed at higher levels than the respective guide strands at one or more developmental stages , which suggests some involvement of these strands in senegalese sole development.

expression profile and thermal plasticity of conserved mirnas during senegalese sole development
critical early ontogeny events like organogenesis, hatching or metamorphosis in fish involve dramatic changes in signalling, physiology and morphology
. well defined expression windows of myogenic and growth-related genes during senegalese sole ontogeny and larval development have been previously characterised, since different genes are activated or down-regulated at different stages of development
 <cit> . it is plausible that allometric differences in growth of specific tissues may influence the observed mirna expression profiles. nevertheless, substantial changes in the senegalese sole mirna transcriptome during development  highlight the importance of mirnas in tissue and organ differentiation. mirna differential expression has been found during the development of other vertebrate species, and similarly to our work, generally an increasing number of mirnas are observed from the earliest to the latest stages of development
 <cit> . furthermore, we found that whilst some senegalese sole mirnas were expressed throughout early ontogeny, others were stage-specific. the mir- <dig> family is an example of the latter  and it is well known to accelerate deadenylation and clearance of maternal transcripts during zygotic stages
 <cit> . mirnas mostly observed after hatching or during metamorphosis included mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and the let- <dig> family . the latter comprises a family of mirnas that are highly conserved from worms to humans
 <cit>  and are involved in various processes, such as regulating cell proliferation and differentiation during development.

several mirnas showed an expression peak during pre-metamorphosis or metamorphosis . for instance, amongst the mirnas validated by qpcr, mir-17a-5p, mir-26a, mir-130c,mir-181a-5p and mir-181a-3p showed a peak of expression mainly during the pre-metamorphic stage , whereas, mir-199a-5p and mir-206-3p had higher levels at metamorphosis or later . similar results were found for some mirnas in the olive flounder 
 <cit> . flatfish larvae undergo a particularly impressive metamorphosis, resulting in an asymmetrical craniofacial remodelling and lateralized behaviour
 <cit> . in olive flounder, an involvement of mir-206a has also been suggested in the metamorphic process, which is mediated by the thyroid hormone
 <cit> . it is known that senegalese sole larvae have a high growth rate and accumulate energetic compounds until the onset of metamorphosis
 <cit>  but growth rates decrease significantly once metamorphosis starts
 <cit> . it is possible that up-regulation of some mirnas at a pre-metamorphic/metamorphic stages is associated with changes in lipid metabolism and with the complex metamorphic process. such alterations in lipid metabolism may also be correlated with the high expression of mir- <dig> during metamorphosis, as previously observed in other flatfish like halibut
 <cit>  or flounder
 <cit> . mir- <dig>  which is a liver-specific mirna, has a crucial role in lipid metabolism in teleosts
 <cit> . it is therefore plausible that changes in this mirna abundance might be related with physiological changes occurring during metamorphosis.

some of the mirnas identified in senegalese sole are known to play a stimulatory role in somatic growth and specifically in skeletal muscle development. in mammals, mir-26a up-regulation is described to post-transcriptionally repress the histone methyltransferase ezh <dig>  which is a suppressor of skeletal muscle cell differentiation
 <cit> . in fish, such as the common carp, this mirna was also associated with myogenesis
 <cit> . in our study, the higher mir-26a expression observed in the 21°c group during hatching  indicates a possible activation of the myogenic programme at a higher temperature. a similar conclusion can be drawn from mir-181a-5p expression in senegalese sole embryos. mir- <dig> is strongly up-regulated in regenerating muscle from an in vivo mouse model of muscle injury
 <cit>  and endurance exercise was also found to significantly increase the expression of mir- <dig> in mice skeletal muscle
 <cit> . these results are consistent with previous findings in senegalese sole, where a lower incubation temperature  produced lighter larvae with smaller fast fibres
 <cit> .

the muscle-specific mir- <dig>  known to reinforce the myogenic program by inhibiting the expression of dna polymerase α  and indirectly down-regulating the myod inhibitors id1- <dig> and myor
 <cit> , showed increased expression levels during embryogenesis at 21°c compared to 15°c, further supporting our observations that this temperature enhanced muscle growth
 <cit> . interestingly, myod was found to regulate the expression of mir-133
 <cit>  and mir-206
 <cit> . transcript levels of myod <dig> at the 20s stage in senegalese sole embryos incubated at 15°c or 21°c
 <cit>  are consistent with the expression of mir- <dig> observed in the present study, which is higher at 21°c than 15°c. a similar conclusion can be drawn for mir- <dig>  based on the digital expression profiling from solid sequencing. in zebrafish and medaka , mir- <dig> is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development but becomes restricted to proliferative tissues later in development
 <cit> . in the present study, we observed increased expression of mir-17a-5p in the 21°c group at some developmental stages ; whether this is related with increased cellular proliferation is however unknown. activation of the mir-214/ <dig> cluster coincides with the recruitment of myod and myogenin
 <cit> . furthermore, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are positively associated with muscle regeneration and remodelling
 <cit> . this ability to stimulate myogenesis may explain the differences in transcript levels of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> between the two temperature groups of senegalese sole larvae at hatching. higher levels of these mirnas are consistent with the observed muscle phenotype in the 21°c group compared to larvae reared at 15°c
 <cit> .

the observed growth differences between temperature groups may also be associated with other metabolic functions , since the abundance of mirnas related to lipid metabolism differed across temperature groups. for instance, the guide strand of the liver-specific mir- <dig> was expressed at higher levels at 15°c than at 21°c. given the role of this mirna in fatty-acid oxidation, and therefore in energy production, it is plausible that temperature affected lipid metabolism and energy utilisation of sole larvae, thus affecting growth. furthermore, since the passenger strand was expressed at high levels, one can hypothesise that it may also play an active role in lipid metabolism.

prediction of potential targets of the differentially regulated senegalese sole mirnas
several mirnas were computationally predicted with high confidence to target mrnas directly related to myogenesis . however, it should be noted that mirnas can have multiple mrnas targets and whole larvae were used to investigate mirna expression in this study. hence, it is likely that expression levels of some senegalese sole mirnas reflect a broader gene regulation, except for those that are muscle-specific, such as mir- <dig> 

mtor and p <dig> mapk pathways have overlapping yet distinct roles during myogenesis: both are required for myogenic differentiation and p <dig> mapk, but not mtor, can inhibit proliferation
 <cit> . it was also suggested that the normoxia activation of mapk/erk signalling pathway not only stimulates myoblast proliferation
 <cit>  but also suppresses myogenic differentiation
 <cit> . mapks can be activated by a wide variety of different stimuli, but in general mapk <dig> and  <dig>  are preferentially activated in response to growth factors whereas the jnk and p <dig> kinases  are more responsive to stress stimuli like osmotic shock or ionizing radiation
 <cit> . the major direct or indirect targets of mtor appear to be mechanisms responsible for ribosome recruitment to mrna, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e , which is activated by the phosphorylation of its repressors, the 4ebp proteins
 <cit> . phosphorylation of 4ebp <dig> by mtor stimulates translation initiation through the release of eif4e from 4ebp <dig>  allowing eif4e to associate with eif4g to enhance cap-dependent translation
 <cit> .

the dna-damage-inducible transcript  <dig>  suppresses mtor activity through the tsc1/tsc <dig> heterodimer
 <cit> . mir-181a-5p up-regulation in senegalese sole hatchlings at 21°c may down-regulate this mtor inhibitor. mir-181a-5p was also predicted to target the 3’ utr of mapk <dig>  thus, the up-regulation of mir-181a-5p at 21°c during early development may have led to higher myogenic differentiation of this group. mapk <dig> and mapk <dig> are potential targets of mir-17a-5p, which are involved in mapk/erk and jnk/p <dig> mapk signalling pathways, respectively. in human cell lines, mir-17-5p targets the 3’utr of mapk9
 <cit> . mapk <dig> is a negative regulator of cellular proliferation through the jnk/p <dig> mapk pathway
 <cit>  and this interaction contributed to the proliferative phenotype caused by mir-17-5p
 <cit> . in the present study, mir-130c was predicted to target mapk <dig> mrna and may therefore have a role in regulating cell proliferation at some developmental stages.

mir- <dig> was predicted to target sestrin <dig>  which codes for a negative regulator of mtor signalling through activation of ampk and tsc <dig> phosphorylation
 <cit> . the up-regulation of mir- <dig> at 21°c during early development may have down-regulated this myogenic inhibitor. furthermore, sestrin <dig> was predicted to be regulated by mir-17a. like sestrin <dig> and sestrin <dig>  sestrin <dig> promotes ampk activity
 <cit>  and it has been shown that the induced expression of sestrin <dig> by foxo <dig> transcription factor inhibits mtor complex  <dig> , which regulates cell growth mostly through increased protein synthesis
 <cit> . mir-17a up-regulation at hatching in larvae reared at 21°c is consistent with a possible down-regulation of sestrin <dig> and a concomitant increase in growth.

calpains are known to play a role in myogenesis, namely in promoting myoblast fusion
 <cit> . senegalese sole mir-181a-3p was predicted with high confidence to target the 3’ utr of calpain  <dig>  its  <dig> -fold up-regulation at 15°c during somitogenesis indicates a possible repression of calpain  <dig>  which would impair the fusion of myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes at this temperature and result in the observed muscle phenotype differences between the two temperature groups
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> conserved mirnas in senegalese sole, most of them dynamically expressed during early development and  <dig> not previously described in teleosts. embryonic temperature affected the expression of several mirnas, and it seems that a higher incubation temperature  promoted expression of mirnas positively related with growth at specific developmental stages. in particular, higher expression levels of mir-17a, mir-181-5p and mir- <dig> and down-regulation of mir-181a-3p at 21°c may promote myogenesis and are in agreement with previous studies in senegalese sole, which reported enhanced growth at higher embryonic temperatures compared to 15°c. also, mirnas related to lipid metabolism and energy production  may also be involved in the differential growth of fish with temperature. taken together, our data indicate that mirnas may play a role in temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of growth in teleosts.
