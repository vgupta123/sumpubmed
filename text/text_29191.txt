BACKGROUND
the widespread usage, disposal all around the world and a consumption of up to  <dig>  t per year, makes the various groups of antibiotics an important issue for micropollutants risk assessment  <cit> . their discharge and thus presence in the environment has become of major concern for environmental protection strategies. antibiotics are designed to inhibit microorganisms and therefore influence microbial communities in different ecosystems  <cit> . monitoring programs have already shown that antibiotics can be found nearly everywhere in the environment, even in concentrations up to μg l- <dig> leading to antibiotic resistance in organisms  <cit> . antibiotic resistance genes might be transferred to human-pathogenic organisms by horizontal gene-transfer and become a serious issue, especially multidrug resistance in bacteria  <cit> .

sulfamethoxazole  is one of the most often applied antibiotics  <cit> . the frequent use of smx results in wastewater concentrations up to μg l- <dig> and surface water concentrations in the ng l- <dig> scale  <cit> . even in groundwater smx was found at concentrations up to 410 ng l- <dig> <cit> . these smx concentrations might be too low for inhibitory effects as the mic <dig> for m. tuberculosis was found to be  <dig>  mg l- <dig> <cit> , but they might be high enough to function as signalling molecule to trigger other processes like quorum sensing in environmental microbial communities  <cit> .

as shown by different studies  <cit> , smx can induce microbial resistances and reduce microbial activity and diversity arising the need for a better understanding of smx biodegradation. smx inflow concentrations in wwtps in μg l- <dig> combined with often partly elimination ranging from 0% to 90%  <cit>  result in high effluent discharge into the environment. to predict the extent of removal knowledge about the responsible biodegrading microorganisms is implicitly required to optimize environmental nutrient conditions for smx removal and degradation rates. it is known that smx can be removed by photodegradation occurring mainly in surface waters  <cit>  and sorption processes in activated sludge systems  <cit> . however, biodegradation is, especially in wwtps, probably the major removal process. literature data focusing on smx biodegradation in lab scale experiments with activated sludge communities and pure cultures showed a high fluctuation from almost complete smx elimination  to hardly any removal of smx . the determined smx biodegradation potential was clearly affected by nutrient supply. therefore this study’s emphasis is on clarifying the effect that addition of readily degradable carbon and/or nitrogen sources in some cases significantly enhanced smx elimination  while in other cases supplementation showed no effect .

for this purpose pure culture were isolated from smx-acclimated activated sludge communities and identified in respect to taxonomy and biodegradation capacity. aerobic smx biodegradation experiments with different species were carried out at various nutrient conditions to screen biodegradation potential and behaviour as a base for future research on biodegradation pathways.

RESULTS
smx biodegradation
cultivation and evaluation of pure cultures biodegradation potential
isolation of pure cultures was accomplished from smx-acclimated asc. growth of cultures on solid r2a-uv media, spiked with 10 mg l- <dig> smx, was controlled every 24 hours. all morphologically different colonies were streaked onto fresh r2a-uv agar plates, finally resulting in  <dig> pure cultures. for identification of potential smx biodegrading cultures, all  <dig> isolates were inoculated in 20 ml msm-cn media. smx biodegradation was controlled every two days. after two days a decrease in absorbance was already detected in  <dig> cultures followed by  <dig> more at day  <dig> and  <dig> while the remaining cultures showed no change. the experiment was stopped after 21 days revealing no further smx biodegrading culture. a 50% cutoff line defined a 50% decrease in uv-absorbance being significant enough to be sure that the corresponding organisms showed biodegradation.  <dig> organisms showed a decrease in absorbance greater than 50% of initial value and were defined as potential smx biodegrading organisms. they were taxonomically identified and used for subsequent biodegradation experiments.

additionally, biodegradation of these  <dig> identified isolates was validated by lc-uv . for cost efficiency only initial and end concentrations of smx in the media were determined as absorbance values did not change any more. a decrease in smx concentration from initially 10 mg l- <dig> to below 5 mg l- <dig> was detected for all  <dig> isolates  after 10 days of incubation. it was proven that only  <dig> cultures eliminated all 10 mg l- <dig> smx completely while the residual smx concentrations for the remaining cultures ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg l- <dig> after 10 days of incubation.

taxonomic and phylogenetic identification of pure cultures
all  <dig> cultures were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis to evaluate their phylogenetic position and closest relative. four cultures, smx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  turned out to be the same organism closely related to pseudomonas sp. he  with a sequence similarity of 99%. only smx  <dig> was kept for further experiments as it showed fastest biodegradation in pre-tests . hence, a total of  <dig> different bacterial species with smx biodegradation capacity were obtained. their accession numbers, genus names and their closest relatives as found in the ncbi database , are shown as a maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic tree  evaluated with 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons to calculate the most exact branching  <cit> .

seven of the nine isolates are affiliated within the phylum proteobacteria represented by the classes alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria, while two belonged to the phylum actinobacteria.

the phylogenetic positions of the seven isolated pure cultures, affiliated within the phylum proteobacteria, were located in the same tree . five different pseudomonas spp. were identified and form two different clades representing a highly diverse group. pseudomonas sp. smx <dig> and  <dig> is building an individual cluster but belonged to the same group as smx <dig> and  <dig>  all four are closely related to p. fluorescens but smx <dig> showed a remarkable difference. in contrast to the described pseudomonas spp. above, pseudomonas sp. smx <dig> clusters together with p. putida and p. alcaligenes but forms an individual branch.

the other two proteobacteria identified pure cultures belonged to the genera variovorax  and brevundimonas . the isolated variovorax smx <dig> fell into the variovorax paradoxus/boronicumulans group with a sequence similarity >99% to v. paradoxus .

the brevundimonas sp. smxb <dig> was clearly separated from its closest relatives brevundimonas basaltis and b. lenta and formed its own branch.

both actinobacteria affiliated pure cultures were identified as microbacterium spp. and were embedded in a new phylogenetic tree as their phylogenetic position was too far from the other isolates . the two isolated species were affiliated to two different clades clearly separated from m. lacus and m. aurum. microbacterium sp. smxb <dig> fell into the same group as microbacterium sp.  <dig> 1 k and m. hatatonis but the branch length clearly showed separation. microbacterium sp. smx <dig> was closely related with a sequence similarity of >99% to microbacterium sp. br <dig> which was found to biodegrade smx in an acclimated membrane bioreactor  <cit> .

smx biodegradation studies with pure cultures
setups with sterile biomass  and without biomass  proved smx to be stable under the operating conditions. therefore sorption onto biomass or other materials was shown to be negligible. photodegradation was excluded by performing all experiments in the dark.

to characterize biodegradation ability and rate and evaluate an optimal nutrient environment for smx utilization of the isolated and identified  <dig> pure cultures, subsequent experiments were performed. in the presence of readily degradable carbon and/or nitrogen sources  smx was faster biodegraded compared to setups with smx as sole carbon/nitrogen source .  <dig> setups  with different nutrient compositions were set up and smx biodegradation rates were evaluated using uv-am values . different smx biodegradation patterns were observed proving that the presence or absence of readily degradable and complex nutrients significantly influenced biodegradation.

isolation was performed from an smx-acclimated as community, followed by identification with 16s rrna sequencing. ena accession numbers and species names are provided.

r2a-uv media were sampled once a day as it was assumed that biodegradation might be faster compared to the other two nutrient-poor media. biodegradation rates of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig> were found for all nine species not showing any different biodegradation behaviors or patterns . although biomass growth affected background absorbance that increased with cell density, uv-am could still be applied to monitor biodegradation as background absorbance was still in a measurable range.

in msm-cn , offering only specific c- and n-sources, the biodegradation rates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig>  showing clear differences for the different species, even for the five pseudomonas spp.. while pseudomonas sp. smx <dig> biodegraded smx with  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig>  pseudomonas sp. smx <dig> just showed a rate of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig>  the same effect was found for the two microbacterium spp.. while microbacterium sp. smxb <dig> removed smx with  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig>  microbacterium sp. smx <dig> showed a removal of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig> only. biodegradation pattern in msm-cn of four isolates  revealed a short lag phase of two days with no smx removal  while the other five were able to biodegrade smx already after two days and showed a constant smx removal during cultivation .

in msm , with smx as sole c- and n-source, the removal rate of smx was even lower. biodegradation rates of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig> were found for brevundimonas sp. smxb <dig> while pseudomonas sp. smx <dig> showed  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig>  all other species showed removal rates of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig>  these experiments with smx as sole c/n-source proved that it could serve as nutrient source but with up to  <dig> -fold reduced biodegradation rates. biodegradation pattern in msm was similar to that in msm-cn with a lag phase of two days for the four isolates smx <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and b <dig>  and no lag phase for the isolates smx  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and b <dig> starting to utilize smx already after two days . in general it was found that the five pseudomonas spp. and the two microbacterium spp. did not show the same biodegradation behavior. at least one member of each group always showed a lag phase while the other immediately started smx biodegradation.

as uv-am revealed sufficient to monitor smx biodegradation  lc-uv measurements were only performed at the start of the experiment, day  <dig> and at day  <dig> as control measurement . lc-uv showed that in r2a-uv all cultures removed 10 mg l- <dig> smx in 4 days  while in msm-cn only pseudomonas sp. smx <dig> removed all smx within 4 days . the remaining  <dig> cultures still showed residual smx concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg l- <dig> and complete smx elimination was achieved only at day  <dig> . in msm after 4 days smx was still present in all nine cultures in concentrations above  <dig>  mg l- <dig> and only after 10 days smx was below the limit of detection . lc-uv values could be compared to uv-am values and proved this simple approach to be applicable for screening smx biodegradation.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
this study focused on the cultivation of pure culture smx biodegrading organisms to perform specific biodegradation experiments. it is known that cultivation, especially on solid media, is affected with the problem described as “viable but non cultivable”   <cit> . solid media being implicitly required for the isolation of pure cultures is for sure limited in its cultivation efficiency mainly due to reduced water content and different or inappropriate nutrient conditions. thus only a low percentage of around 1% of the active organisms in environmental samples  <cit>  and around 15% from activated sludge can be cultivated  <cit> . in this study  <dig> different isolates out of  <dig> pure cultures were obtained that showed smx biodegradation. this quite high percentage of almost 10% was only possible with a two-step smx-acclimation experiment that was conducted to increase the chance to cultivate smx biodegrading organisms by applying a strong selective pressure using 10 mg l- <dig> smx in the media. furthermore, r2a medium that is known to work well for isolation of aquatic organisms  <cit>  was applied for the cultivation of bacteria being assumed to be at least smx-resistant when growth was observed on smx-reinforced r2a. however, a lot more organisms compared to those cultivated in this study might be present in activated sludge capable of smx biodegradation. these vbncs might be taxonomically characterized by culture-independent methods, e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphism screening  <cit> . however, for our focus on linking biodegradation patterns, rates and nutrient utilization to specific species these methods were not feasible. only with actively biodegrading pure cultures a clear and precise coherence between smx biodegradation and taxonomically identified species is possible. as a final goal, pure cultures would allow to analyze species-specific biodegradation products and thus determine potential smx biodegradation pathways. applying that knowledge to wwtp techniques would provide a strategy to selectively enhance biodegrading species in activated sludge systems improving and stabilizing smx removal efficiency.

therefore phylogenetic identification of potential smx biodegrading species is implicitly required. as shown in this study five of the nine smx biodegrading species found belonged to the genus pseudomonas confirming this group to play an important role for the biodegradation of micropollutants. this was proved for e.g. acetaminophen or chlorinated compounds by many other studies  <cit> . additionally, two isolates smxb <dig> and smx <dig> were identified as microbacterium sp.. it was shown that microbacterium sp. smxb <dig> is closely related to microbacterium sp.  <dig> 1 k, an organism that was found to be related with phytoremediation. the second microbacterium sp. smx <dig> is closely related to microbacterium sp. br <dig> which was isolated from an acclimated smx biodegrading membrane bioreactor, proving this species’ crucial role for the biodegradation of smx  <cit> . in addition the general potential of different microbacteria species for the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds has been highlighted in the literature  <cit> . also variovorax paradoxus, closely related to the isolated variovorax sp. smx <dig>  is known from literature to be capable of biodegrading a large variety of pollutants including sulfolene and other heterocyclic compounds  <cit> . therefore it seems likely that the isolated variovorax sp. smx <dig> might also be able to biodegrade smx. finally, also for the group brevundimonas spp. some literature data exist proving that these organisms might play a role in the removal of antibiotics  <cit> .

taxonomic identification was followed by observing influences on biodegradation rate and efficiency due to the availability of nutrients. biodegradation rates decreased with reduced nutrient content from the complex r2a-uv over nutrient-poor msm-cn and msm media and more time was needed to remove smx. msm media contained smx as sole carbon and nitrogen source at a concentration of 10 mg l- <dig> and thus provided just around  <dig>  mg l- <dig> carbon and  <dig>  mg l- <dig> nitrogen. these conditions, with smx being the only nutrient in msm, showed an effect on biodegradation and reduced removal efficiency but proved the organisms’ ability to utilize smx as sole nutrient and/or energy source. however, this indicates that complex nutrients and higher nutrient concentrations seem to have a positive effect on biodegradation due to co-metabolic  <cit>  or diauxic effects  <cit>  as the very high smx removal rates of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig> confirmed that they were significantly higher than the one of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> d- <dig> found in a previous study  <cit> .

in general, smx biodegradation might be based more on a diauxic process, i.e. readily degradable nutrients are used up first followed by smx utilization, rather than real co-metabolism, i.e. two substrates are used up in parallel when provided together, as experiments with r2a-uv media showed. a strong increase in uv-am, attributed to biomass growth due to a fast nutrient consumption provided by the complex r2a-uv media, was followed by a rapid smx elimination. in msm-cn or msm, as the nutrients concentrations were too low to foster excessive biomass growth, such an increase was not observed . even at low cell densities smx was rapidly removed proving that biomass concentration is not as important as cellular activity. therefore, the higher removal rates in presence of sufficient nutrients also showed that smx biodegradation was a rapid and complex metabolic process.

therefore, information about the biodegradation potential of the isolated bacterial strains with respect to the availability of nutrients might increase the elimination efficiency in wwtps as the treatment process could be specifically adapted to the needs of the biodegrading species.

for future research, the availability of isolated species will allow screening for biodegradation intermediates and/or stable metabolites and determination of species-specific biodegradation pathways. to date only few data on smx metabolites such as 3-amino-5-methyl-isoxazole found in smx degrading activated sludge communities  <cit>  and hydroxy-n-benzene-1-sulfonamide detected in an smx degrading consortium of fungi and rhodococcus rhodochrous exists  <cit> . further research is also needed to screen for the nutrient influence on metabolite formation, i.e. if the isolated pure cultures produce different metabolites due to changing nutrient conditions.
