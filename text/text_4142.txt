BACKGROUND
current evidence suggests that candida albicans acquires azole resistance by employing multiple mechanisms that include  alterations in the azole-target protein erg11p  upregulation of the erg <dig> gene  <cit>  as well as  failure of drug accumulation mediated by efflux pumps. most commonly, genes encoding drug efflux pumps belonging to atp binding cassette  and major facilitator  superfamilies of proteins are overexpressed in azole resistant candida isolates  <cit> . abc family permeases are in general multicomponent primary active transporters, capable of transporting both small molecules and macromolecules which is coupled to atp hydrolysis while the mfs transporters are single-polypeptide secondary carriers capable only of transporting small solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients. we have earlier annotated and classified abc transporters in c. albicans  <cit> , however, clinically relevant mfs superfamily in c. albicans largely remains uncharacterized.

mfs superfamily is ubiquitously present in all kingdoms of life and includes members of direct medical and pharmaceutical significance. they are involved in the symport, antiport or uniport of various substrates  <cit>  and are known to exhibit specificity for sugars, polyols, drugs, neurotransmitters, krebs cycle metabolites, phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates, amino acids, peptides, osmolites, siderophores , iron-siderophores , nucleosides, organic and inorganic anions, etc  <cit> . most mfs proteins vary between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues in length and possess either  <dig> or  <dig> putative transmembrane segments . the mfs superfamily consists of  <dig> families according to the transport commission  system given by saier and group . tc is a comprehensive classification system for membrane transport proteins and is analogous to the enzyme commission  system, except that it incorporates both functional and phylogenetic information  <cit> . this system allocates five digits to each phylogenetic cluster of transporters. the first two digits  identify the transport mode and energy-coupling mechanism. the third digit characterizes phylogenetic "families" or "superfamilies." the fourth digit identifies phylogenetic "subfamilies." the fifth digit  corresponds to the substrate specificity, as presumed by experimental data or stringent sequence identity  <cit> . in tc, the designation  <dig> a. <dig> represents mfs and the next digit denotes the family, for instance,  <dig> a. <dig>  represents sugar transporters and so on. any two transport systems in the same subfamily of a transporter family that transport the same substrate are given the same tc number, regardless of whether they are orthologues or paralogues.

till date only a few mfs transporters namely mdr <dig>  flu <dig>  nag <dig>  nag <dig>  jen <dig>  arn <dig> and ngt <dig>  <cit> , have been identified and characterized in c. albicans. additionally, over  <dig> hexose transporters and glucose sensors are known to exist in c. albicans that reflect the varied niches in which this pathogen thrives  <cit> . however, very limited knowledge about other mfs transporters is available in c. albicans. out of all the known mfs in c. albicans mdr <dig>  its alleles and flu <dig> are shown to be the only drug efflux pumps transporters. mdr <dig> was initially identified as a gene, which conferred resistance to the tubulin binding agent benomyl and tetrahydrofolate reductase inhibitor methotrexate  <cit> . mdr <dig> expression in s. cerevisiae confers resistance to several unrelated drugs and its overexpression has been linked to azole resistance in c. albicans. the expression of mdr <dig> in c. albicans cells is enhanced by benomyl, methotrexate and several other unrelated drugs, and is found to be more pronounced in some of the azole resistant clinical isolates  <cit> . keeping in view, the relevance of the mfs multidrug transporters in general and in multidrug resistance  in particular, in the present study, we have examined mfs superfamily of proteins in c. albicans. although, earlier annotation of the previous candida genome assembly  predicted  <dig> mfs genes, no systematic classification was given  <cit> . to address this question, we have applied a comprehensive bioinformatics approach to identify and annotate all mfs transporter genes in the candida genome from assembly version  <dig> and systematically searched for evidence of their expression. it is hoped that these findings will provide the scientific community with the necessary framework needed for the functional characterization of the mfs proteins and a better understanding of this medically and pharmaceutically significant superfamily.

RESULTS
identification and sequence-based functional grouping of c. albicans putative mfs genes
to identify gene loci encoding mfs proteins, multiple tblastn searches were performed on assembly  of the c. albicans genome  using well known mfs proteins as queries. the orfs thus identified were subjected to domain analysis followed by sequence-based functional grouping, resulting in clustering of putative candida proteins into various mfs families as described by saier's tc system. using this strategy, we identified a total of  <dig> loci of putative mfs genes in the candida genome containing the domains characteristic of mfs proteins and were found to be either  <dig> or  <dig> transmembrane spanners . by using tc system, all the putative mfs identified were assigned to  <dig> tc families . the family assignment obtained by this approach was validated by applying the same strategy to s. cerevisiae mfs transportome . s. cerevisiae homologues of c. albicans mfs proteins were found to take up the same tc cluster thereby addressing the evolutionary relationship between the two yeasts. a summary of the previously known candida genes together with the new genes is presented in additional file  <dig>  where, tc family, cgd orf, gene, alias, tcdb homolog and expression confirmation are listed. in addition, the closest s. cerevisiae member within the family is also presented in additional file  <dig> 

the sugar porter  family 
the sp family is widespread and have members from all of the major groups of living organisms: bacteria, archaea, eukaryotic protists, fungi, animals and plants  <cit> . it forms one of the largest families with  <dig> members in c. albicans. we have previously characterized hgt <dig>  <cit>  and many studies since then have also reported other sp members namely hgt2-hgt <dig>  <cit> . apart from identifying hgt1-hgt <dig>  in the present study, we have also identified two previously unidentified members, namely mal <dig>  and orf <dig>   both having homologues in s. cerevisiae, mal <dig> and yfl040w, respectively. further, based on the homology, the  <dig> sp members show significant similarity with various sugars, namely arabinose, quinate, myoinositol, maltose, fructose, glycerol, monosaccharide, glucose, hexoseand xylose .

the drug: h+ antiporter- <dig>  family 
dha <dig> family like the sp is widely distributed and the members include both drug-specific and mdr efflux pumps. like sp it also forms one of the largest families having  <dig> members in candida . mdr <dig> gene in c. albicans is one of the best characterized members, originally known to confer resistance to benomyl and methotrexate  <cit> . subsequent studies indicated that mdr <dig> also encodes resistance to cycloheximide, benztriazoles, 4-nitroquinolone-n-oxide and sulfometuron methyl  <cit> . disruption of the mdr <dig> gene reduced the virulence of c. albicans  <cit> . other characterized members of this family include flu <dig>  nag <dig> and nag <dig>  disruption of flu <dig> in c. albicans hyper-susceptibility to mycophenolic acid thus suggesting that it could be a preferred substrate for the transporter  <cit> . on the other hand, nag <dig>  and nag <dig>  show susceptibility to a number of unrelated compounds such as cycloheximide, 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide and  <dig> -phenanthroline and are upregulated in response to these drugs, suggesting that they function as multiple drug efflux pumps  <cit> . apart from mdr <dig>  which is known as a clinically relevant efflux pump protein, none of the other characterized members have been directly linked to mdr of c. albicans.

the drug: h+ antiporter- <dig>  family 
the dha <dig> family of drug:h+ antiporters with  <dig> predicted transmembrane-spanning segments, consists of nine members in c. albicans which show significant similarity to transporters, namely aminotriazole, 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide, me2+-tetracycline antiporter, vacuolar basic amino acid  transporter and metal:tetracycline/oxytetracycline efflux pump . in c. albicans no member of this family has yet been characterized whereas in s. cerevisiae two dha <dig> proteins, sge <dig> and atr <dig> are well studied. atr <dig> has been shown to confer resistance to the structurally unrelated compounds aminotriazole and 4-nitroquinolone-n-oxide and expression of atr <dig> is inducible by the former but not the latter  <cit> . sge <dig> appears to confer resistance to crystal violet  <cit>  and ethidium bromide  <cit> .

the fucose: h+ symporter  family 
fhs is a small family with two orfs identified in candida namely: orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  . they are homologous to s. cerevisiae bsc <dig>  which encodes a protein of unknown function exhibiting genomic organization compatible with a translational read through-dependent mode of expression  <cit> .

the phosphate: h+ symporter  family 
phs family is unusual in that it has representatives only in yeast, fungi and plants but none in bacteria, animals and other eukaryotes  <cit> . the occurrence of distant homologues in both the plant and fungal kingdoms suggests that they possess isoforms that diverged from each other well before plants diverged from fungi  <cit> . two well characterized members of the phs family are the pho <dig> inorganic phosphate transporter of s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and the gvpt phosphate transporter of glomus versiforme  <cit> . in this study, we have identified five orfs belonging to phs family in c. albicans with homology to phosphate: h+ symporters . however, none of the members identified in candida has yet been characterized.

the oxalate: formate antiporter  family 
ofa family members are widely distributed in nature, being present in the bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic kingdoms  <cit> . in c. albicans, our searches revealed two members . oxlt, the oxalate:formate antiporter from oxalobacter formigenes, is the hallmark protein and provides the basis for naming the ofa family  <cit> . this protein has been purified, reconstituted in an artificial membrane system as well as structurally and functionally characterized  <cit> .

the sialate: h+ symporter  family 
shs family, like the phs family, is very small with only two members namely jen <dig> and jen <dig>  identified in the present as well as a previous study  <cit> . jen <dig> has been described as the first monocarboxylate transporter of c. albicans showing loss of all measurable lactate permease activity upon its disruption. further, lactate uptake by jen <dig> was competitively inhibited by pyruvic and propionic acids while acetic acid behaved as a non-competitive substrate  <cit> .

the monocarboxylate porter  family 
mcp family is exclusively present in yeasts and animals. in mammals, these permeases are known to transport monocarboxylates, namely pyruvate, lactate and mevalonate with inwardly-directed polarity and presumably function as proton symporter  <cit>  while it is reported that the yeast monocarboxylate transporter proteins perform functions other than their mammalian counterparts  <cit> . this family has six members identified in candida.

the anion: cation symporter  family 
acs is a relatively large family having representation in bacteria, yeasts and animals comprising mainly of symporters that are known to accumulate their substrates in symport with either na+ or h+, depending on the system. they may transport either inorganic  or organic anions   <cit> . in candida, we have identified  <dig> members showing significant similarity to transporters having prefered substrates, namely tartrate, allantoate, nicotinate, biotin and pantothenate .

the aromatic acid: h+ symporter  family 
the members of aahs family occur exclusively in gram-negative bacteria where they are known to transport a variety of aromatic acids like benzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate,  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetate as well as niacin and cis, cis-muconate  <cit> . in candida, a single member of aahs family has been identified, namely orf <dig>  showing significant similarity to putative niacin uptake porter . this family has no representation in s. cerevisiae and thus unique to candida.

the siderophore-iron transporter family 
all the known members of this family are from yeast species. in c. albicans this family is represented by a single protein known as siderophore transporter, sit1/arn <dig>  which is required in ferrichrome-iron uptake. previous reports suggest that deletion of arn <dig> leads to reduced ability of c. albicans to use iron bound to the hydroxamate-type siderophore ferrichrome and upon deletion of the two high-affinity iron permease c. albicans genes , the activity was completely abolished  <cit> . according to another study, siderophore uptake by sit1p/arn1p is required in a specific process of c. albicans infection, namely epithelial invasion and penetration, while in the blood or within organs other sources of iron, including heme, may be used  <cit> .

the organic cation transporter  family 
in c. albicans this family is represented by a single uncharacterized member fgr <dig>  showing similarity to organic anion: dicarboxylate transporter. these proteins are known to transport organic cations and/or anions and catalyze uptake of cationic drugs such as tetramethyl ammonium, cimetidine, procainamide, quinidine and some endogenous metabolites such as n-methyl-nicotinamide  <cit> .

the vesicular neurotransmitter transporter  family 
these proteins are more closely related to sp family than to other mfs families. the better characterized members of the vnt family are synaptic vesicle proteins from mammals, the electric eel and insects  <cit> . in c. albicans this family is represented by a single member orf <dig>  with significant similarity to dopamine transporter.

the peptide-acetyl-coenzyme a  transporter family 
members of the pat family are present across bacteria, yeast and animals  <cit> . amongst the well characterized proteins of this family include acetyl-coa transporter localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi membranes of humans  <cit> . ampg protein of e. coli belonging to pat family, brings into the cell peptides, including cell wall degradative peptides and glycopeptides, to act as inducers of β-lactamase synthesis  <cit> . the acetyl-coa transporter is expected to function by acetyl-coa:coa antiport while the ampg protein is most likely energized by substrate:h+ symport. in c. albicans this family is represented by a single member orf <dig>  with significant homology to acetyl-coa:coa antiporter.

the l-amino acid transporter- <dig>  family  
lat <dig> transports neutral amino acids such as l-leucine, l-isoleucine, l-valine and l-phenylalanine by a na+-independent, electroneutral, facilitated diffusion process and also transports amino acid alcohols. in c. albicans, this family is represented by two orfs: orf <dig>  and orf <dig> .

the proton coupled folate transporter/heme carrier protein  family 
in c. albicans, this family is represented by a single member orf <dig>  showing homology to high-affinity folate transporter. pcft from human has been shown to act both as an intestinal proton-coupled high-affinity folate transporter and as an intestinal heme transporter which mediates heme uptake from the gut lumen into duodenal epithelial cells. the iron is then released from heme and may be transported into the bloodstream  <cit> .

the n-acetylglucosamine transporter family 
ngt <dig> from c. albicans represents the first eukaryotic n-acetylglucosamine  transporter and is the only known member of this family. it is required for efficient glcnac uptake and for inducing hyphae development at low glcnac concentrations  <cit> . high concentrations of glcnac could bypass the need for ngt <dig> to induce hyphae, indicating that elevated intracellular levels of glcnac induce hyphal formation. expression of ngt <dig> in s. cerevisiae promoted glcnac uptake, indicating that ngt <dig> acts directly as a glcnac transporter  <cit> . no homologue of ngt <dig> was detected in s.cerevisiae.

most of the identified members of mfs superfamily are expressed
to assess which of the identified candida mfs transporter genes are transcribed or translated, we analyzed all  <dig> mfs transporter loci by extensive mining of the data available from the genome or proteome-wide studies in c. albicans. using this approach, we found that out of the  <dig> orfs,  <dig> were shown to express either at mrna or protein level under different experimental conditions . to validate the expression of the remaining  <dig> putative mfs genes , we employed reverse transcriptase pcr  approach taking a well characterized c. albicans mfs transporter, mdr <dig> as a positive control. the primers utilized for expression analysis are shown in table  <dig>  interestingly, no expression was detected in any of the  <dig> putative genes tested under the basal condition .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report the complete transportome of mfs superfamily of c. albicans. computational analysis of the c. albicans genome assembly  from cgd enabled us to identify  <dig> potential mfs permeases. the latter were classified according to both phylogeny and function based tc system earlier developed by saier  <cit> . this approach enabled us to cluster these  <dig> mfs proteins into  <dig> distinct families. indeed each of the predictions must be tested experimentally before final conclusions are reached with reference to the expression and function of the proteins analyzed.

the comparison between c. albicans and s. cerevisiae mfs genes revealed that predominantly most of the families are present in both the organisms . notably, there were few families that were present only in c. albicans: ofa, aahs, oct, vnt, pcft/hcp and nag-t . interestingly, in ofa family, the s. cerevisiae mfs genes, mhc <dig> and ymr155w, although orthologues of c. albicans orf <dig>  and orf <dig> , respectively, yet do not conform to the same tc family designation as candida, rather these genes were found to be more similar to oxlt of oxalobacter formigenes, a bacterial oxalate: formate antiporter . similar was the case with c. albicans orf <dig> , where the s. cerevisiae orthologue, yjl163c, belong to dha <dig> family instead of pcft/hcp family . it was also observed in the aahs family, candida genes are more closely related to gram-negative bacteria  as compared to s. cerevisiae which probably explains the absence of homologues of this family in s. cerevisiae. on a similar pattern, the mfs genes of c. albicans belonging to oct and vnt families are closely related to animals and no significant homologies were detected in s. cerevisiae genome. the nag-t family also did not find any representation in s. cerevisiae genome. taken together, these findings point out that probably these genes had diverged during the course of evolution. interestingly, vacuolar basic amino acid  family present in s. cerevisiae has no representation in c. albicans . although the c. albicans orfs, orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  show significant homology to s. cerevisiae v-baat family members, vba <dig> and vba <dig>  respectively, they belong to dha <dig> family supporting the fact that v-baat family is most similar to the dha <dig> family.

our expression analysis of the published work revealed that out of  <dig> mfs genes,  <dig> are expressed under either basal  or in different specific experimental conditions . most of the genes identified in the present investigation are expressed either at mrna or protein level thus validating our analysis. the expression of the remaining  <dig> genes was not detected. this would imply that either these genes are expressed under specific growth condition or that they may be candidate pseudogenes. to dissect the role of each putative member of mfs superfamily, an essential part of the process will now involve construction of multiple knockout mutants, which will enable to unravel their role in drug or nutrient transport.
