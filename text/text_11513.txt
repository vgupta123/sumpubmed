BACKGROUND
the predatory ladybirds  include many beneficial and economically significant species that are used as biological control agents against insect pests. besides various insects and mites, many ladybirds can also feed on plant materials and fungi  <cit> . coccids  and aphids are two of the most important prey types of predatory ladybirds. globally, coccids are the dominant prey groups of 36 % of coccinellidae species, whereas 20 % prey primarily on aphids  <cit> . evolutionary studies of the family coccinellidae have suggested that ancestral ladybirds have switched from fungi to coccids  <cit> . several clades have subsequently adapted to feeding on aphids or have then switched back to feeding on coccids  <cit> . coccids and aphids have a quite different biochemical composition and possess different secondary metabolic products for self-protection  <cit> , although they are closely related in systematics. thus, the mechanisms of adaptation to these two diets and of diet shifts in ladybirds should be unique, but they are still incompletely understood  <cit> . as a result, the evolutionary processes of ladybirds led by diet shifts remain unclear.

identifying transcriptional changes associated with the early stages of diet shifts is an important step in understanding the role of transcriptional plasticity and subsequent gene evolution in facilitating adaptation  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated transcriptional regulations associated with insects feeding on different plant diets, and these regulations were commonly detected in ribosomal proteins, detoxification enzymes and digestive proteases  <cit> . however, relatively few studies have examined such mechanisms in ladybirds or other insect predators  <cit> .

cryptolaemus montrouzieri  is native to australia but is used worldwide as biological control agent. this species provides an opportunity to study the above issue because it mainly feeds on coccid species in the field, while it can also feed on aphids, whiteflies and eggs of moths or other ladybirds under laboratory conditions  <cit> . these non-coccid diets are overall less suitable for survival, development and reproduction of c. montrouzieri, but often suffice for completing its life cycle  <cit> . in the present study, we explored the mechanisms involved in diet change from coccids to aphids by this coccidophagous ladybird. a laboratory population of c. montrouzieri that was maintained on the citrus mealybug planococcus citri for several years was artificially transferred to the aphid megoura japonica, a common aphid pest in china  <cit> . we first compared the life history traits of c. montrouzieri feeding on these two foods, which allowed us to test their suitability to support development and reproduction. to investigate how transcriptional variation may contribute to adaptation to a new food, we then compared gene expression among the two diet treatments in order to find differentially expressed genes  in response to the diet shift.

sequence data processing
we sequenced eight transcriptome libraries, which were from c. montrouzieri fourth instar larvae feeding on mealybugs , fourth instar larvae feeding on aphids , female adults feeding on mealybugs  and female adults feeding on aphids . each of them had 20– <dig> million high-quality reads comprised of 5– <dig> billion nucleotides  . these reads were assembled into  <dig> , <dig> contigs,  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  unigenes, with  <dig>  % of the unigenes being more than 500 bp and  <dig>  % of the unigenes more than 1000 bp . of these unigenes,  <dig>   were annotated in the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant dataset , swissprot, cluster of orthologous groups , eukaryotic orthologous groups , pfam, gene ontology  or kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  . the highest percentage of c. montrouzieri sequences were matched to tribolium castaneum . the fpkm  density had a similar pattern within each sample of two individuals  , indicating that our transcriptome analysis of each treatment was highly reproducible.

transcriptional responses to diet shift
an overall view of gene expressions in the eight transcriptome libraries of c. montrouzieri is presented in the hierarchical clustering heat map in additional file 4: figure s <dig> and in the summary of degs in additional file 1: table s <dig>  with details of the fourth instar in additional file 5: table s <dig> and adult stage in additional file 6: table s <dig>  respectively. as shown, their gene expressions were predominantly affected by development stage, followed by diet. in this study, we mainly focused on the effect of diet shifts. so, the following deg analysis would only be performed in lm vs la and am vs aa, respectively. in fourth instar larvae, a total of  <dig> degs were observed in the aphid-feeding lines compared with the mealybug-feeding lines, among which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated, while fewer degs were observed in the adult stage. for the diet treatments of adults, the total number of degs was  <dig>  with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. in addition,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in both the larval and adult stage .

in fourth instar larvae, the strongest changes in the aphid-feeding lines were in the ribosome of cellular component  categories, followed by structural constituent of ribosome of molecular function go categories and translation of biological process go categories . these three changes were considered significant, with –log <dig> higher than  <dig>  among all of the degs in fourth instar larvae,  <dig> were coding the large 60s and small 40s ribosomal proteins, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . in the adult stage, no degs related to ribosome were detected. in this stage, the strongest changes were in the ‘de novo’ integral membrane protein  biosynthetic process and oxidation-reduction process of biological process go categories, followed by oxidoreductase activity of molecular function go categories . only one cellular component go category was in the top  <dig> of the strongest changes. however, these changes in the adult stage were not significant, with –log <dig> lower than  <dig> fig.  <dig> gene ontology  enrichment of differentially expressed genes  in a fourth instar larva and b adult female. the  <dig> most enriched go terms are shown together with their -log <dig> and number of genes

in fourth instar larvae, the genes that were differentially expressed in the aphid-feeding lines were involved in  <dig> kegg pathways, mainly involving ribosome, linoleic acid metabolism and drug metabolism-cytochrome p <dig> . in the adult stage, the genes that were differentially expressed in the aphid-feeding lines were involved in  <dig> kegg pathways, mainly involving glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation and one carbon pool folate . among the top  <dig> of the strongest changed pathways, eight were common in fourth instar larvae and adults, with four being related to biochemical  metabolism and three being related to detoxification. according to the results of kog annotations of transport and metabolism of six key biochemicals, most of the degs related to carbohydrate and amino acid transport and metabolism were up-regulated, while degs related to lipid transport and metabolism were both up-regulated and down-regulated . among the detoxifying genes, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases , glutathione s-transferases , udp-glycosyltransferases  and carboxylesterases  were commonly reported in previous studies . in this study, most of the detoxification-related degs were p450s. all of these detoxification-related degs were mainly up-regulated .fig.  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways enrichment of differentially expressed genes  in a fourth instar larva and b adult female. the  <dig> most enriched kegg pathways are shown together with their q-value , rich factor  and number of genes 



twenty-one degs of fourth instars and  <dig> of female adults were randomly selected to validate the expression profiles obtained with the transcriptome analysis. all of them yielded quantitative real-time pcr  products, whose sequences perfectly matched the up or down-regulations of transcriptome analysis . these results demonstrate the reliability of the results of the transcriptome analysis.

discussion
diet is a major determinant of physiological performance in insects  <cit> , and diet shifts can involve changes associated with life history, physiological and behavioral traits . with the development of next generation sequencing methods, studies have begun to identify genes under regulation or evolution associated with diet shifts in insects . furthermore, the relationship between changes in life history traits and transcriptome can help us to better understand the mechanism of adaptation to diet shifts  <cit> . also, although little attention has been directed towards analyzing transcriptional adaptation of insect predators to diet shifts, recent comparative gene expression studies of phytophagous insects or mites adapted to different host plants  <cit>  and predatory insects adapted to an artificial diet  <cit>  provide a basis for comparison to the findings of our study.

changes in life history traits
in this study, c. montrouzieri feeding on either mealybugs or aphids successfully completed their life cycles. although c. montrouzieri has long been considered as a mealybug specialist  <cit> , a current host range test indicated that c. montrouzieri can also be maintained on several non-coccid prey species under laboratory conditions  <cit> . however, such diet shifts significantly changed some of the life history traits in both the larval and adult stages of c. montrouzieri  <cit> . in this study, all of the changes in development, survival and reproduction were adverse, suggesting that a diet of aphids would be less suitable for this coccidophagous ladybird than mealybugs. this unsuitability of aphids to c. montrouzieri can possibly be attributed to differences in the biochemical composition, body size and mobility of the prey and tritrophic effects caused by the different host plant-prey associations  <cit> . also, these changes in life history traits possibly reflected differential expression of related genes in adaptation to diet shift.

degs related to ribosome and translation
in this study, the most remarkable change in gene expression of c. montrouzieri feeding on aphids is in ribosome and translation. the results of deg enrichments suggested that genes related to ribosome and translation, mainly coding ribosomal proteins of 40s and 60s, were specifically over-represented after the diet shift in the fourth instar larvae, and most of these genes were up-regulated. ribosome synthesis and translation are usually at high rates during development  <cit> . as such change was not detected in the adult stage, we note that the factors of degs related to ribosome and translation are important for the development of larvae. on the other hand, ribosomal proteins are mostly associated with their standard role in protein translation and genes encoding them have been considered as stably expressed ‘housekeeping’ genes. nevertheless, these genes also have been reported to be differentially regulated in polygonia c-album  <cit> , heliothis virescens  <cit> , bemisia tabaci  <cit>  and helicoverpa armigera  <cit>  when feeding on unsuitable diets, and mostly they were also up-regulated. in an insect-plant system, these differential regulations in insects are considered to counteract the ribosome-inactivating proteins, which are insecticidal proteins in certain plants  <cit> . although no ribosome-inactivating protein has been reported in aphids or mealybugs, it is possible that prey contain similar proteins, which activate the regulation of genes related to ribosome and translation in their predators. however, there are no previous reports on such regulation in predator–prey systems, and such regulation and its mechanism are worthy to be investigated in the future.

degs related to biochemical transport and metabolism
although coccids and aphids are from the same order , they are expected to differ in biochemical composition  <cit>  and thus have a different nutritional value for ladybird predators. there is evidence for some differentially expressed metabolism-related genes of insects in adapting to different biochemical composition of diets  <cit> . in this study, the different composition of the two diets was also reflected in the transcriptional changes of biochemical metabolism we observed in c. montrouzieri. among the transport and metabolism of six key biochemicals, the three energy related chemical groups  had the highest number of degs, and the degs related to carbohydrate and amino acid were mainly up-regulated in both life stages. these results suggest that key nutrients for c. montrouzieri might be lacking when feeding on aphids, so that their transport and metabolism need to be accordingly controlled by gene regulation. although there are some data on the nutritional biology of the more plastic aphidophagous ladybirds  <cit> , there is little or no information on the nutrient requirements of the more specialized coccid-feeding ladybirds. an alternative explanation may lie in tritrophic effects related to the different food of the aphids and mealybugs. our study only provides a general view of the transcriptional changes in biochemical transport and metabolism in response to diet shift, and an organ/tissue specific experiment  could help to detect a more accurate response.

degs related to detoxification
besides their nutritional requirements, insects should at the same time be able to cope with toxic chemicals from their diets. when confronted with diet shifts, insects can successfully survive on their new diet through enzymes coded by detoxifying genes, among which p450s, gsts, ugts and ces have been widely reported . in this study, the genes in several detoxification pathways were significantly regulated in both fourth instar larvae and adults of c. montrouzieri. among these pathways, we detected that several detoxification-related genes, especially the p450s, were differentially regulated and mainly up-regulated in both life stages when feeding on aphids as compared with mealybugs. eleven p450s, one ugt and two ces were up-regulated and one ugt was down-regulated commonly in both fourth instar larvae and adults, suggesting that these genes might be more important in detoxification during diet shifts than the others. the expression of p <dig> genes can control the transformation of a number of xenobiotics in herbivorous insects  <cit> , and is reported to be involved in the detoxification of pesticides in c. montrouzieri  <cit>  and another ladybird propylea japonica  <cit> . these results, together with lower survival rates of the larval stage, suggest that c. montrouzieri might succeed in feeding on aphids by eliminating or transforming toxic chemicals from the prey, and the up-regulation of p <dig> or other detoxification-related genes could play an important role in this process.

possibility of diet-associated evolution
diet shift and subsequent adaptation can drive evolution and diversity of fast-evolved arthropods  <cit> . in this study, despite the fact that a large number of genes were regulated in adaptation to a new diet, the individuals of c. montrouzieri feeding on aphids had a lower developmental and reproductive performance than those given mealybugs. directional selection is expected to further alter the plastic response in the direction of the optimum, and thus results in adaptive evolution . in this case, if ladybirds sustain in a long-term feeding on a new diet, the degs which were initially beneficial in this diet shift may subsequently evolve. for instance, the detoxification gene gstd <dig> of drosophila melanogaster was under positive selection among populations feeding on different diets  <cit> , and this gene was first differentially regulated in early diet shifts  <cit> . thus, the degs detected in this study could be further used to explore the diet-associated evolution within c. montrouzieri and other coccinellidae.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we explored how a ladybird adapted to diet shift using comparisons of life history traits and transcriptome profiles. we showed that the new diets were less suitable to the ladybirds. the up-regulation of genes related to ribosome and translation in instars may be related to their suboptimal development. in addition, the up-regulation of genes related to biochemical transport and metabolism, and detoxification were probably as a result of adaptation to the changes in nutritional and non-nutritional  components of the prey. in the future, these candidate genes are valuable for the studies of the functional evolution of ladybirds led by diet shifts.
