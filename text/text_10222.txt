BACKGROUND
the zebrafish  has long been appreciated as a unique model system for vertebrate genetics and developmental biology. the zebrafish genome is about half the size of most mammalian genomes  <cit>  containing some  <dig>  pg of dna  <cit>  distributed across  <dig> pairs of chromosomes   <cit> . initial comparisons of zebrafish and mammalian gene maps have revealed extensive conservation of syntenic chromosome regions among vertebrates  <cit> . hence, through the use of zebrafish mutants and a well annotated zebrafish reference genome, genetic mechanisms that are conserved among all vertebrates, can be investigated.

since the launch of the trans-nih genome initiative in  <dig>  <cit> , excellent genetic and genome resources have been established to facilitate the genetic analysis of zebrafish. the first genetic linkage map was constructed using haploid genetics with random amplified polymorphic dna  markers  <cit> . several meiotic panels  and radiation hybrid  panels  have been generated  <cit> . most recently, the wellcome trust sanger institute  released the sixth zebrafish genome assembly , comprising of  <dig>  gb  <cit> . this assembly was generated from  <dig>  bac clones, which were fingerprinted and then arranged into contigs by overlap analysis to generate a physical map. dna sequence data from whole genome shotgun contigs were then used to fill gaps. while more high-throughput methods for dna sequencing are now emerging , a major limitation of many of these technologies is the provision of relatively short dna sequences , making such sequencing technologies problematic with the assembly of repeated dna elements  <cit> .

cytogenetic methodologies provide a complementary mapping approach for assembly of reference genomes. in this study, we have employed two cytogenetic approaches to define the zebrafish genome: flow karyotype analysis and chromosomal mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization . in flow karyotyping, each chromosome is labeled directly with two dna-binding fluorochromes  and then analyzed on a flow cytometer. the fluorescence from the two dna-binding dyes enables different chromosome types to be identified by both dna content and base-pair ratio, providing a means to estimate the relative size of each zebrafish chromosome. in fish, cloned dna sequences are hybridized to their complementary sequences and visually mapped onto metaphase chromosomes. in this study, we have unequivocally mapped  <dig> large-insert dna clones onto zebrafish metaphase chromosomes using multi-color fish methods. these clones can be used as anchors for annotation of the zebrafish reference genome and provide independent validation of the sequence map, in a fashion similar to how cytogenetic data from the human genome was integrated into the human dna sequence map  <cit> . these data reinforce the use of cytogenetic methodologies for the assembly of complex genomes.

RESULTS
estimation of chromosome sizes based on flow cytometry
zebrafish chromosomes were analyzed by flow cytometry and the bivariate flow karyotypes obtained for the mixed human-zebrafish and zebrafish chromosome preparations are shown in figures 1a and 1b, respectively. in contrast to the human chromosomes that are generally well resolved, with the exception of human chromosomes 9– <dig>  the  <dig> pairs of zebrafish chromosomes were only resolved into approximately  <dig> peaks. chromosomes were flow sorted from each peak and after amplification by dop-pcr, hybridized together with chromosome-specific markers  <cit>  to identify the chromosomal composition of each peak . it should be noted that since there is an absence of a consensus karyotype, the zebrafish community has chosen to name each chromosome based upon syntenic markers to a given linkage group . for example, markers on lg  <dig> have been cytogenetically mapped to a particular chromosome, which is now designated as lg chromosome  <dig>  three peaks each contained one chromosome , while the remaining nine peaks each contained  <dig> to  <dig> chromosomes  due to the similarity of chromosomal size and at/gc ratio of the non-homologous chromosomes in each peak. the largest chromosomes  are of similar size to human chromosome  <dig>  while the smallest chromosomes  are slightly smaller than human chromosome  <dig>  using human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> as references, we have estimated the sizes of all  <dig> zebrafish chromosomes from the flow karyotype .

chromosomal mapping of  <dig> bac clones by fish
a total of  <dig> bac clones were processed for cytogenetic mapping in the zebrafish genome. the lg chromosome for which each bac clone was predicted to reside, was determined by searching four available zebrafish databases  the university of california – santa cruz zebrafish genome browser   <cit> ,  the ensembl zebrafish genome browser  <cit> ,  vega, a zebrafish genome annotation tool  <cit> , and  the zebrafish genome fingerprinting project clone database   <cit> ). mapping information was available in at least one of the databases for most all the clones, while there was almost always some discrepancy among the four databases . each bac probe was labeled with a fluorochrome  and combined with a near-centromeric or near-telomeric probe  from the same lg chromosome, as defined by our first generation zebrafish bac clone probe panel  <cit> . bac clones were initially mapped onto metaphase chromosomes from an established and stable fibroblast cell line from an ab strain zebrafish and also confirmed on metaphase chromosomes from wild-type ab and tu embryos.

data obtained as of august 2006

of the  <dig> bac clones that were processed for fish mapping, a total of  <dig> bac clones localized to apparently unique chromosomal locations on metaphase chromosome spreads.  <dig> %  of these clones, approximately  <dig> % of the zebrafish genome , were assigned to a specific lg chromosome . of the  <dig> bac clones assigned to a unique lg chromosome by fish mapping, ensembl and vega did not have mapping information on a substantial number of these clones . ensembl zv <dig>  did not contain any clones from the danio key  library investigated in this study . when evaluating only those clones present in the databases, lg chromosome assignments agreed for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the clones and disagreed for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the clones, dependent upon the database . a common discrepancy between the predicted lg chromosome location and the assigned lg chromosome from fish mapping, occurred for bac clones which were found to chromosomally localize to the heterochromatic region on the long arm  of lg chromosome  <dig>   <dig> %  of the clones that uniquely fish mapped to the heterochromatic region of lg chromosome  <dig> were assigned to lg chromosome  <dig> by at least one of the databases .

thirty-one clones  mapped cytogenetically to multiple chromosomal locations . one of the clones had two signals on the same chromosome ,  <dig> clones had hybridization signals on two different, non-homologous chromosomes ,  <dig> clone had signals on three different, non-homologous chromosomes , and  <dig> clones had signals on four different, non-homologous chromosomes . five bac clones were pan-centromeric  and five bac clones were peri-centromeric .

one consistent discrepancy was observed in the mapping results between the two zebrafish strains analyzed . the bac clone zk167c <dig> consistently localized near the centromere of the long arm of lg chromosome  <dig> in the tu strain , but had three different hybridization patterns in the metaphase preparations from ab embryos. in certain embryos, a homozygous state was observed with zk167c <dig> localizing to the long arm peri-centromeric region of lg chromosome  <dig>  as seen with the tu strain. other ab embryos exhibited a heterozygous state with zk167c <dig> localizing near the centromere of one homolog of lg chromosome  <dig>  while hybridization on the other homolog was in the middle of the short arm . other ab embryos revealed zk167c <dig> hybridization signals in the middle of the short arm of both homologs of lg chromosome  <dig>  this result is consistent with the existence of a polymorphic peri-centromeric chromosomal inversion in the zebrafish ab strain.

a total of  <dig> bac clones  failed to produce distinct and reproducible fish signals, even after multiple hybridization attempts. these clones may be shorter than the average bac clone or could contain substantial amounts of highly repetitive elements that are largely out competed by unlabeled cot <dig> dna during the fish procedure.

development of a second generation probe panel
while carrying out the fish mapping assessments, particular attention was given to bac clones that localized near the centromere or the telomeres of each lg chromosome. subsequently, an improved second generation probe panel has now been established using bac clones that were visually closer to these chromosomal domains compared to corresponding clones in the first generation probe panel. this second generation probe panel has substituted  <dig> of the  <dig> bac clones  and also includes a telomeric clone for the long arm of lg chromosome  <dig> , which was not previously available.

discussion
following analysis of the initial zebrafish gene maps, it has been suggested that during the course of evolution, the zebrafish and human lineages shared two rounds of whole genome duplication with a third whole genome duplication event occurring before the last teleost radiation  <cit> . the duplicated genome of the zebrafish has contributed to the increased difficulty in constructing an accurate genetic map for this organism, in comparison to the mouse and human. in addition, similarity in the size, morphology, and banding pattern of the zebrafish chromosomes has resulted in at least  <dig> different published zebrafish karyotypes . phillips et al.  <cit>  used a combination of relative size and chromosome arm ratios to estimate the sizes of each zebrafish chromosome. when comparing the chromosome size estimates from our flow cytometry data to the size estimates reported by phillips et al.  <cit> , the four largest lg chromosomes  and the three smallest lg chromosomes  are in agreement. however, the ranking of sizes of most other lg chromosomes are discrepant and should be investigated further by other independent studies.

cytogenetic mapping is a complementary approach to other mapping strategies  and can be used to confirm existing framework maps. using fluorescence in situ hybridization ,  <dig> bac clones were assigned to unique lg chromosome locations in this study. this suggests that if there is widespread duplication in the zebrafish genome, a large proportion of these appear to be syntenic and localized . fish mapping data was over 85% concordant for three of the four zebrafish genome databases  with  <dig> % concordance for the ucsc genome browser, when evaluating the bac clones present in these databases . discrepancies between the fish mapping data and the lg chromosome assignment by the zebrafish genome databases may be attributed to cross-contamination of the clones, clone tracking inconsistencies, incorrect assignment by previous mapping efforts, or inconsistencies among the four zebrafish genome databases. from the comparisons, it became evident that at the time of analysis, there is some degree of discrepancy among all four of the zebrafish genome databases. in addition, the ensembl zv <dig>  used in this analysis did not contain any of the bac clones of the zk library. of the  <dig> bac clones that were assigned to specific lg chromosomes by fish, only  <dig> clones did not have mapping information in any of the databases. in addition for  <dig> of the  <dig> clones with database mapping information, none of the databases had the same chromosomal assignment as was assigned by fish .

a small percentage of the clones were observed to hybridize to multiple locations within the zebrafish genome . one clone contained duplicated regions within the same chromosome, while the remaining thirty clones hybridized to more than one chromosome. many of the bac clones that hybridized to multiple chromosomal locations localized near the centromeres, providing further evidence for the lack of chromosome-specific repetitive dna sequences near these regions. these clones provide clues to duplications and exchanges that have occurred within and between chromosomes. further investigation is needed to determine the functional significance of these duplications.

some bac clones yielded weak or no fluorescence signals. the lack of signals for these clones may be due to poor quality of probe dna, contamination with non-zebrafish dna, loss of insert dna or poor hybridization due to factors such as increased repetitive dna elements within a clone.

one particularly fascinating observation was a peri-centromeric inversion on lg chromosome  <dig> . interestingly, this heteromorphism was seen only in the ab strain and not in tu embryos. this finding suggests that there are strain-specific chromosomal differences in the zebrafish. large chromosomal rearrangements  are important for evolution and are suspected to play a role in speciation. studies have suggested that inversions can influence patterns of nucleotide diversity between diverging taxa  <cit>  and encourage speciation by suppressing recombination in heterozygotes  <cit> . chromosomal inversions can also play a role in fertility. for example, peri-centromeric inversion carriers may have a reduction in fertility due to the production of chromosomally unbalanced gametes. in a recent study, it has also been suggested that chromosomal inversions may be beneficial. carriers for an inversion on human chromosome  <dig> were reported to have increased fertility rates in comparison to non-carriers  <cit> .

chromosomal mapping of zebrafish bac clones by fish in this study resulted in a second generation near-centromere and near-telomere bac clone probe panel, which includes  <dig> % new clones. these new bac clones are visually mapped closer to the centromere or telomeres of each lg chromosome than those in the original probe panel. furthermore, a near-telomeric bac clone was identified at the long arm terminus of lg chromosome  <dig> . the long arm of lg chromosome  <dig>  has been previously shown to contain a substantial amount of constitutive heterochromatin  <cit> . regions of constitutive heterochromatin often consist of highly repetitive dna and are largely transcriptionally silent. the heterochromatic region of lg chromosome  <dig> is late replicating  <cit> , stains darker than the short arm by c-banding  <cit> , and is reported to also harbor 5s rdna  <cit> . in the current study,  <dig> bac clones mapped uniquely to the heterochromatic region of lg chromsome  <dig> . moreover, five bac clones that mapped to multiple chromosome locations included this heterochromatic region on lg chromosome  <dig> . this would suggest a complex genome structure of multiple repetitive dna families in this region on lg chromosome  <dig>  some of which are shared sequences at other chromosomal regions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used flow cytometry and chromosomal mapping to develop a cytogenetic map of the zebrafish genome. these data can be integrated with genetic and radiation hybrid mapping data to produce a refined sequence map and to confirm the existing genomic framework of the zebrafish. a refined zebrafish genome serves as a valuable resource for genetic research that utilizes this model organism for understanding of the molecular basis of human diseases. for example, the mapped clones can be used to narrow the search for candidate genes, which may be altered in zebrafish mutant models using fish assays. this strategy was recently used to identify a loss of one allele of the separase gene, when a probe containing the separase gene locus was hybridized upon epithelial tumor specimen, indicating that a loss of one copy of separase is sufficient to promote tumorigenesis in the zebrafish  <cit> . the cytogenetically mapped clones can also be used in the development of a zebrafish array comparative genomic hybridization platform for use in identifying genomic imbalances in developmental and disease zebrafish models. integrating these bac clones with the zebrafish reference sequence will allow investigators to directly determine the genomic regions that are gained or lost. overall these data contribute towards the ultimate defintion of a reference zebrafish genome and provide insight into the evolution of vertebrate chromosomes.
