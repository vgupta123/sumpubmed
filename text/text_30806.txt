BACKGROUND
sorghum is a major staple food and fodder crop grown worldwide, with an annual average production of  <dig> million tonnes over the past decade  <cit> . the crop is tolerant of many biotic and abiotic stresses and is often grown in more marginal cropping areas. in developing countries it tends to be a staple food and forage of the poor. in developed countries it is used primarily as an animal feed. sorghum is often preferentially grown in both situations as it is better adapted to water limited environments than other cereal crops.

investment in sorghum breeding and genomic resources has been less than for the other major cereals rice, wheat, maize and barley. interest has focused on the crop due to its drought resistance and small genome size  compared to close relatives maize  and sugarcane   <cit> . in recent years the potential of sorghum as a biofuel crop has led to additional investment culminating in the sequencing of the sorghum genome  <cit> .

numerous studies have demonstrated that sorghum is very diverse crop, with cultivated sorghums exhibiting great phenotypic variability. the cultivated germplasm has been classified into five major races  and  <dig> intermediate races based on panicle and spikelet morphology  <cit> . in order to exploit this diversity at the genotypic level, an efficient marker system is required. many molecular marker technologies have been developed and applied to studying patterns of genetic diversity in sorghum germplasm collections and in breeding programs, including rflps  <cit> , rapds  <cit> , issrs  <cit> , ssrs  <cit>  and aflps  <cit> . however, the major limitation to the widespread use of current marker technologies in applied sorghum breeding programs and germplasm collections is the high cost per data point. applications that require whole genome scans such as pedigree analysis  <cit> , association mapping  <cit>  and mapping as you go   <cit> , or large scale genotyping of germplasm collections  <cit>  are not cost effective using current technologies.

the current molecular marker technologies have characteristics which additionally affect the level of genome coverage, their discrimination ability, reproducibility and technical and time demand. a number of the limitations associated with the different marker technologies can be overcome by utilising specialised hardware such as high throughput capillary electrophoresis machines, which can impact on discrimination ability, reproducibility and speed. however, the majority of the limitations are related to the sequential nature and high assay costs of the marker technologies, in addition to reliance on dna sequence information. diversity arrays technology  can over come these limitations and has been developed as a hybridisation-based alternative to the majority of gel-based marker technologies currently in use. the dart genotyping method was developed originally for rice  <cit>  and has subsequently been applied to many other plant species, including barley  <cit> , cassava  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , pigeonpea  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . dart has been also applied to a number of animal species and microorganisms  <cit> . the dart methodology offers a high multiplexing level, being able to simultaneously type several thousand loci per assay, while being independent of sequence information. dart assays generate whole-genome fingerprints by scoring the presence versus absence of dna fragments in genomic representations generated from genomic dna samples through the process of complexity reduction.

this paper reports the results of a study designed to : develop a sorghum diversity array for dart genotyping, : determine linkage map positions of polymorphic darts and : assess utility of dart technology in diversity analyses on a set of diverse sorghum lines, including selected lines from the department of primary industries and fisheries  sorghum breeding program. in order to evaluate the discriminatory ability of darts, efforts have been made to include the same genotypes used in genetic diversity studies based on other molecular marker technologies.

RESULTS
evaluation of complexity reduction methods and array development
the initial tests of dart performance in sorghum were done on eight sorghum genotypes . based on our positive experience with psti-based genomic representations  <cit>  we initially evaluated several combinations of psti with different frequently cutting restriction enzymes  as a complexity reduction approach for sorghum. dna samples from the eight sorghum genotypes were digested with psti and several frequently cutting re , ligated to a psti adapter and then amplified with the psti- <dig> primer. gel analysis of the pcr products showed that a uniform smear  only appeared in the psti+banii combination. other re combinations gave a smear with one or more dominant bands. such strong bands represent highly amplified restriction fragments and correspond to abundant repetitive sequences in the representation; a feature which is highly detrimental to dart performance  <cit> .

aflp-like analysis was performed to estimate the fragment number in the psti+banii representation following the approach utilized by xia et al.  <cit> . four primers containing  <dig> selective bases at the 3'end were used for the amplification. for all four primers, a large number of fragments were visible on the gel, making a precise estimate of the total number of fragments impossible . interestingly, a similar approach resulted in an easily quantifiable number of bands in cassava which has a similar genome size to sorghum and even in barley, which has genome size almost seven times larger than sorghum. the results suggest that the psti+banii representation in sorghum has a larger number of unique fragments than the psti+bstni representation in barley which was reported to contain  <dig>  markers placed on the integrated map of barley genome  <cit> .

based on the extended psti+banii sub-libraries and the additional libraries generated based on the genomic subtraction  method  <cit> , the best dart markers from the initial experiments were "cherry picked" and a "re-array library" with  <dig> polymorphic clones was created. in addition to these  <dig> polymorphism-enriched clones, a further  <dig> clones from psti+banii library c were used for all genotyping work reported here.

genetic relationships between sorghum lines revealed by dart
the selected dart clones were tested for their ability to resolve genetic relationships among a set of  <dig> lines. the reproducibility of the dart genotyping array was successfully validated by independent assays from the same dna. the genotypes selected represent a significant proportion of the genetic variation in sorghum with all  <dig> races represented and  <dig> intermediate races also represented. in addition, the germplasm set included elite lines from breeding programs some of which had high levels of co-ancestry.

dartsoft analysis  identified  <dig> markers polymorphic among  <dig> genotypes typed on the array. the pic values of these  <dig> markers were very high with over 69% of the markers having a pic value between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the average pic was  <dig> , higher than the previous dart studies in barley  and comparable with cassava . the relationship between the quality of the dart markers  and the performance of the dart markers as determined through call rate and pic was analysed . the pic values were largely independent of marker quality, with only a small reduction in pic value observed in the lowest quality class . as expected, the average call rate decreased with average q value. the markers with the highest q values  had very high average call rates , while the markers in the lower quality marker classes had lower average call rates and higher standard deviations.

cluster analysis based on the dice dissimilarity index and the unweighted neighbour-joining method was performed on the  <dig> dart markers for  <dig> genotypes . this cluster analysis discriminated well between all  <dig> genotypes and has a cophenetic correlation value of  <dig> , indicating an excellent fit of the similarity matrix data to the tree topology. thirteen main clusters were identified which correspond well with race and origin of the genotyped lines. in particular a single predominant race or origin could be identified in  <dig> out of the  <dig> clusters. cluster  <dig> contained  <dig> genotypes in total, of which  <dig> were kafir or kafir-caudatum. cluster  <dig> contained  <dig> genotypes, of which  <dig> were of race durra. additionally, two ethiopian durra types  grouped together within this cluster with a boot strap value of 100%. cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig> chinese genotypes of complex racial background. cluster  <dig> contained the wild species, s. propinquum and the weedy subspecies, s. bicolor subsp. verticilliflorum . cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig> caudatum genotypes . cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig> genotypes in total, of which  <dig> were caudatum or caudatum-derived. cluster  <dig> consisted of a tight cluster of restorer  lines predominately from australian breeding programs; r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> are all progeny of the line r31945-2- <dig>  cluster  <dig> is a looser cluster consisting of  <dig> lines of which  <dig> were caudatum or caudatum-derived. finally cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig> genotypes of which  <dig> are bicolor or bicolor intermediate and s. bicolor subsp. drummondii which is very similar morphologically to the bicolor race.

mapping of dart loci
to confirm that the sorghum dart markers behave in a mendelian manner, we constructed a genetic linkage map for a cross between r931945-2- <dig> and is  <dig>  we selected  <dig> dart markers with q-values greater than 80% and merged with the segregation data for  <dig> markers, consisting of  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> aflps and  <dig> morphological markers derived from the original map  <cit> .

in total,  <dig> markers could be placed on the integrated linkage map, which spanned  <dig>  cm . the genetic linkage map had an average marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm, with an average dart marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm. the  <dig> dart markers included on the map mapped to all  <dig> chromosomes and are distributed across the genome in a similar way as the  <dig> ssr and  <dig> aflp markers , suggesting that the density of both groups of markers roughly followed the distribution of dna polymorphism across the genome. the dart markers accounted for approximately 50% of the framework markers used in the initial construction of each linkage group, with a high proportion of the dart markers acting as delegates  indicating a higher level of redundancy compared to the other marker types. we therefore compared the level of redundancy, as determined through co-location, between the dart markers generated from the  <dig> subtraction libraries  versus those developed from the extended psti+banii sub-libraries. of the  <dig> darts included on the map,  <dig> were ssh-dervied and of these  <dig>  were redundant, whereas the  <dig> non-ssh derived darts exhibited a reduced level of redundancy . overall redundancy in the map dropped from  <dig> % to 24% when ssh-derived dart markers were excluded. interestingly, the difference in apparent redundancy levels between ssh-derived and "normal" dart markers was smaller compared to what we observed for tomato and sugarcane  and in fern species asplenium and moss species garovaglia .

* 'framework' markers are defined as those that could be ordered with a jack-knife value of 90% or greater using the multipoint software; delegate markers are defined as those that map to the same location as the representative framework marker for a specific locus; attached markers are those that initially were excluded from the framework map as they caused unstable neighborhoods but were included in the final, complete map by assigning them to the best intervals on the framework map.

there was no statistically significant difference between dart and non-dart markers in the distribution of parental alleles across the genome. twelve darts were removed during the course of map construction either because of lack of linkage to other markers, or as they formed small linkage groups containing only darts which did not link to the known chromosomes.

discussion
sorghum dart markers
this is the first report of the use of dart technology in sorghum and our results demonstrate that the sorghum dart markers are high quality, as assessed by their call rate, scoring reproducibility and pic values. the dart marker quality parameters measured for the sorghum array are comparable to those obtained for pigeonpea  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and cassava  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> .

utility of darts for diversity analysis
among the criteria for genetic markers that are to be used for fingerprinting and marker-assisted selection is a high level of polymorphism  <cit> . clearly, sorghum darts meet this criterion, with over 69% of the  <dig> darts revealing polymorphism between the set of  <dig> sorghum lines having a pic value between  <dig> - <dig> ;  <dig>  being the highest pic value expected for a bi-allelic marker system. additionally, this study meets all the criteria proposed for evaluating the use of molecular markers for large scale germplasm diversity analyses  <cit> ; a large number of markers, thorough representation of these markers on a genetic linkage map of the species and the selection of monolocus probes. the  <dig> dart markers permitted the unique identification of all  <dig> genotypes including closely related backcross derived lines. the cluster analysis revealed that the  <dig> genotypes examined showed a clear demarcation of the germplasm according to their racial classification, consistent with previous studies using rflps  <cit>  and ssrs and aflps  <cit> . the bicolor race was found to be highly variable in this study, shown by its presence in multiple clusters, as also noted by previous studies  <cit> . in fact, it has been noted previously that race bicolor resembles spontaneous weedy sorghums and is thought to be the race most closely related to wild sorghums  <cit>  and also the most primitive grain sorghum  <cit> . indeed, the bicolor race accession is 12179c included in this study, groups together with the weedy sorghum, s. bicolor subsp. drummondii, in cluster  <dig> .

the race caudatum is one of the most important agronomically, providing genes for high yield and excellent seed quality. it has become one of the most important sources of germplasm in modern breeding programs throughout the world and in this study, the caudatum race genotypes were clearly demarcated in clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, a previous study  <cit>  found no significant differences in diversity between the races, except the kafir race which was less diverse. low genetic diversity was also observed in the kafir race in this study, with all the kafir race accessions constituting a specific cluster . these results are in agreement with the recent origin and restricted geographic distribution of this race, together with recent studies using ssrs  <cit>  and rflps  <cit> .

in addition to the observed clustering on racial groups, differences between the genotypes based on their status as b  and r  lines was also noted. in this study, there was less variation among the b-lines than the r-lines, with the b-lines clustering tightly together in only  <dig> of the  <dig> clusters, whereas the r-lines grouped more loosely in  <dig> clusters. it has also been noted  <cit>  that the lower levels of diversity among elite b-lines vs. r-lines is expected since b-lines are required to produce high quality male-sterile a-lines. the development of new a/b-lines is more difficult compared to r-line development and hence b-line development is more restrictive and slower to incorporate new germplasm. where pedigree data was available, groupings associated with these pedigree relationships were observed.

comparisons of the discrimination ability for dart markers and their ability to reflect pedigree backgrounds in contrast to other marker types is made much simpler when over-lapping sets of germplasm are used in a number of studies. seventeen genotypes included in this study were examined by menz et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> genotypes were in common with ritter et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> with tao et al.  <cit> . very similar groupings of genotypes were observed, e.g. the over-lapping genotypes in cluster  <dig> also group together in previous studies  <cit> , e.g. btx <dig> and bok <dig> grouping tightly together in menz et al.  <cit> , in addition to rtx <dig> and btx <dig>  similarly, icsv <dig>  mp <dig> and macia group together based on aflps  <cit>  and darts , and ql <dig> and r <dig> group together based on rflps  <cit>  and darts .

the separation of "wild" sorghums from cultivated germplasm seems to be less pronounced compared to the results based on ssr data  <cit> . this is not surprising, as the array used for genotyping all materials in this study was developed using mostly dna from cultivated materials. even though three accessions from wild relatives were included in library construction, their "private" alleles were highly "diluted" by common alleles and those which were "private" to the cultivated material. the design of the array did not substantially change the topology of trees generated from dart data, but would reduce the distance between the wild and cultivated samples. we expect that the distance reduction would be up to two-fold, as we were effectively finding unique "0" scores for the wild materials, but less effectively unique "1" scores. such ascertainment bias is not limited to dart, but is a feature of many marker systems. in fact the ascertainment bias will be significantly larger for snp technologies, as most snp markers are developed from a small number of samples/chromosomes in a limited number of populations, even in well resourced human studies  <cit> . the effect of such "marker source sampling bias" was recognised in many human studies, e.g. on population migration rate  <cit> , population mutation and recombination rate estimates  <cit>  and on linkage disequilibrium  estimates  <cit> . marker panels in dart are developed using large and representative sampling from target populations  <cit>  and can be easily expanded by cloning libraries from the germplasm pools for which precise relatedness estimates would be required.

distribution of dart loci in the sorghum genome
the integrated genetic linkage map comprising darts, aflps and ssrs clearly demonstrates that the new sorghum dart markers behave in a mendelian manner. in total,  <dig> darts were mapped to  <dig> unique loci. the higher level of redundancy of the dart markers is reflected by the higher number of aflp and ssr markers having unique segregation patterns. however, the markers on the dart array used in this study were not filtered for redundancy, whereas the ssr/aflp data set had previously undergone curation  <cit> , to remove markers with redundant segregation patterns. also, the total number of dart markers was higher than in other marker classes, therefore the apparent redundancy would need to be also corrected for sample size. after applying such sample-size correction to stmp markers in the linkage map of a cross between two wheat cultivars cranbrook and halberd, a lower level of redundancy was found for the dart markers  <cit> .

the total length of the integrated genetic linkage map was  <dig>  cm, with an average dart marker density of  <dig> per every  <dig>  cm. the total map length is comparable to other recently reported sorghum genetic maps, being slightly shorter than the  <dig> cm high-density genetic linkage map based on  <dig> aflp, rflp and ssr markers  <cit> , and slightly longer than the  <dig>  cm genetic linkage map based on  <dig> rflp probes  <cit> . although the dart markers are distributed across the genome in a similar way to the non-dart markers, there are genomic regions containing significant excesses or paucity of markers, e.g. the centromeric region of sbi- <dig> has a higher than average marker density of 1/ <dig>  cm and the distal ends of sbi- <dig> and sbi- <dig> have marker-poor regions with gaps spanning over  <dig> cm. these areas of low marker density may correspond to regions of similar ancestry or identity by descent  in the germplasm included in the initial diversity representation. in addition, lines with photoperiod sensitivity and tall stature were under represented in the diversity set used to develop the dart markers. these regions of low marker density may be therefore associated with genomic regions that were identical by descent or that had very limited genetic variability in the initial diversity representation. the marker-dense regions appear to correspond to the centromeric regions, a feature that has been observed previously  <cit> . this is also supported by the recent observation that the pericentromeric heterochromatic regions of sorghum chromosomes show much lower rates of recombination  compared to euchromatic regions , with the average rate of recombination across the heterochromatic portion of the sorghum genome being ~34-fold lower than recombination in the euchromatic region  <cit> . it should however be noted that clustering around the centromeres is observed for both dart and non-dart markers, due to the centromeric suppression of recombination. interestingly, dart markers were significantly less clustered at most centromeric regions of barley chromosomes compared to non-dart markers on the integrated map containing approximately  <dig>  markers  <cit> . we will be in position to rigorously test if this difference in marker position holds true in sorghum only after completion of building the consensus map integrating approximately  <dig>  dart markers with similar number of other types of markers .

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully developed dart markers for sorghum bicolor and have demonstrated that dart provides high quality markers that can be used for diversity analyses and to construct medium-density genetic linkage maps. the high number of dart markers generated in a single assay not only provides a precise estimate of genetic relationships among genotypes, but also their even distribution over the genome offers real advantages for a range of molecular breeding and genomics applications. additionally, the availability of the sorghum whole genome sequence by the end of  <dig> offers very exciting opportunities for assessing the colinearity of the dart markers on the genetic linkage maps with the markers on the sequence map. as dart assays are performed on highly parallel and automated platforms the cost of datapoint  is reduced by at least an order of magnitude compared to current, gel-based technologies.
