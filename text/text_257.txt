BACKGROUND
genomic analyses of ancient samples are limited principally by dna preservation. standard ancient dna methods that consist of amplification, followed by cloning and sequencing of multiple clones, have been used to obtain mitochondrial genomes from the bones of mammoths and other permafrost-embedded animals, where up to 400- <dig> base pair dna fragments can be retrieved  <cit> . however, these methods are not as useful for less well-preserved samples  <cit>  where the preference is for different approaches based on the development of metagenomic libraries or direct large-scale genome sequencing through next generation massively-parallel sequencing. for example, the mitochondrial genome and several million base pairs of nuclear dna from neanderthal bone fragments were sequenced with a next generation approach  <cit>  and 80% of the diploid genome from an extinct paleo-eskimo was recovered with a similar procedure  <cit> . these powerful technologies are extremely well suited for the analysis of bulk genomic dna extracted from ancient remains  <cit>  but their use for characterization of the mitochondrial genome is less effective outside of mtdna-enriched tissues such as hair shafts  <cit> . recently, selective target enrichment prior to next generation ultra-deep sequencing has also been shown to be an appropriate method for the characterization of mitochondrial genomes from ancient tissues  <cit> .

in this study, we applied a combined strategy that made use of multiplex pcr amplifications and  <dig> pyrosequencing technology to sequence the complete mitochondrial genome of a bos primigenius sample excavated from vado all'arancio rockshelter in central italy , dated by associated remains at around  <dig> -years. bos primigenius, the aurochs, is the wild ancestor of modern cattle breeds and was formerly widespread across eurasia and northern africa. after a progressive decline thought to be due to overhunting and habitat contraction, the species became extinct in  <dig>  the history of cattle domestication and the degree of genetic contribution of local aurochsen to modern taurine breeds in europe is still a matter of debate  <cit> . while previous studies have utilised both modern and ancient dna sequences, the ancient data consisted almost exclusively of short fragments of the mitochondrial control region. these studies suggested that all northern and central european aurochsen and a small fraction of italian aurochsen had control region sequences belonging to haplogroup p  <cit> , whereas the typical italian aurochsen belonged to haplogroup t  <cit> . modern taurine cattle also possess haplogroup t, with the exception of a handful of individuals who have sequences attributed to the aurochs haplogroup p, or the putative aurochs haplogroups r and q . recently, the first aurochs mtdna genome was typed from a  <dig> -year-old bone sample located in england  <cit> , and this sequence was found to belong to haplogroup p, consistent with the results from the short control region sequences. the present study reports the first pre-neolithic aurochs mitochondrial genome typed from southern europe, and confirms the view that the aurochs was genetically structured in europe, with different local populations having different genetic relationships with the modern cattle.

RESULTS
the bos primigenius mtdna genome
the combined multiplex pcr and  <dig> sequencing procedure generated more than  <dig>  total reads from the vado all'arancio aurochs phalanx bone. approximately 66% of the reads were mapped to the bovine reference mtdna sequence   <cit> . after excluding false insertions and deletions commonly introduced by the  <dig> sequencing technology at homopolymeric strings, a total of  <dig> , <dig> bases  were used to assemble a preliminary consensus sequence. the frequency distribution of the number of reads per nucleotide  is irregular, due to the overlap of fragments and because specific fragments were pyrosequenced more than once. the mean and median number of reads per nucleotide were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. overall, the number of reads for each specific fragment analysed with the  <dig> approach was between one and two orders of magnitude higher than the number of clones commonly sequenced using traditional adna approaches. at each site, the most frequent nucleotide was observed in  <dig> % of the reads on average .

among the  <dig> sites where amplicons overlap, we analysed if different error patterns were observed at sites which are either monomorphic or polymorphic in modern breeds, or at homologous sites typed in different amplicons. different patterns are expected in case of contamination with modern dna. very similar allele frequencies spectra were observed considering separately monomorphic and polymorphic sites in modern breeds, and only  <dig> out of  <dig> sites which are polymorphic in the cattle had a rare allele at a frequency > 2% among the reads . in addition, the frequency of nucleotide misincorporation among reads shows a pattern typical of ancient templates, with an excess of type ii over type i transitions .

the vado all'arancio aurochs sequence showed eight indels and nine mutations compared to the bos taurus reference sequence  <cit> . however we noted that all but one of the indels involved an insertion/deletion of the last base in a homopolymeric string of >  <dig> bases, which is likely to result from an artefact of the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology  <cit> . in two other positions, c- > t substitutions were present in only 54% and 58% respectively of the total reads, a strong signal of nucleotide misincorporations due to degradation of the original templates rather than real substitutions. for this reason we carefully checked these ambiguous positions by singleplex pcrs, cloning and sanger sequencing  before assembling the definitive consensus sequence for the specimen of  <dig>  bp.

the consensus vado all'arancio aurochs sequence differed from the bos taurus reference sequence  at just four transitions, three transversions and one insertion, all located in the mtdna coding region . the positions were confirmed independently in three different adna labs , according to standard practice. when compared to  <dig> complete mtdna sequences from different cattle breeds  <cit> , only three of these positions  correspond to fixed differences. on average, the vado all'arancio aurochs mtdna genome differs from modern domestic cattle at  <dig>  sites , a value similar to the average distance between two modern domestic cows .  <dig> differences were observed between our sample and the complete genome of the  <dig> -year-old english sample  <cit> . substitutions are distributed in the non-coding control region , rrna and trna genes  and in  <dig> protein genes  .

phylogenetic analysis
bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the european cattle and aurochs mtdna coding genomes revealed that a model allowing for polytomies is strongly supported over a strict bifurcating model . therefore, the pattern of previously classified bovid clades and sub-clades is not supported, suggesting that recurrent mutations and short internal branches may limit meaningful evolutionary information. overall, the structure of the bayesian consensus tree  is similar to the tree reported in  <cit>  and  <cit> , but only the major clades  and two subclades  are monophyletic. this result is supported by analysis of the mtdna control region  <cit>  . this suggests that the previously identified t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> clades do not correspond to robust evolutionary clades, and suggests that evolutionary inferences in cattle and aurochs based on mtdna sub-clades frequencies should be avoided.

the vado all'arancio aurochs mtdna genome clearly belongs to the major clade t, and is embedded within the european cattle mitochondrial genealogy in contrast to the british aurochs specimen  <cit> , as previously suggested  <cit> . polymorphisms within the control region sequence of the vado all'arancio specimen had previously led to it being assigned to the t <dig> sub-haplogroup  <cit> . however, our statistical analysis of complete genome sequences indicates that t <dig> is not monophyletic and is therefore not a useful designation for inferring evolutionary processes. in addition, the vado all'arancio sequence does not cluster with any of the cattle sequences previously assigned to the t <dig> sub-haplogroup .

demography, domestication and clades dating
a bayesian skyline analysis was performed with beast  <cit>  to estimate the demographic history of italian cattle.  <dig> modern mtdna genomes from previous studies  <cit>  were used for this analysis. we selected this geographically homogenous subset of mtdna genomes to reduce possible biases due to population structure. as expected from previous studies of the mtdna control region in european cattle  <cit> , a strong signal of rapid demographic expansion was inferred  . the estimated starting date of this expansion varies between about  <dig>  and about  <dig>  years bp depending on the calibration date used for the divergence time between b. taurus and b. bison. in fact, at least three dates have been proposed for this split:  <dig> mya  <cit> ,  <dig> mya  <cit>  and  <dig> mya  <cit> . the rapid increase in population size inferred by the bayesian skyline analysis also points to a very small effective size prior to the expansion, which is compatible with the long-term population size estimated for several modern cattle breeds  <cit> .

it seems therefore that the inferred demographic expansion corresponds to the rapid increase of cattle numbers occurred less than  <dig>  years ago during the neolithic domestication process, considering also that no evidence of expansion was found when pre-domestication specimens were analysed  <cit> . if correct, this would suggest that the most likely divergence time between b. taurus and b. bison is older than  <dig> mya but much younger than  <dig> mya.

we used the  <dig> mya calibration date to estimate the age of several monophyletic mtdna haplogroups in the reconstructed phylogeny , although it is important to note that these dates are only rarely related to population events . the tmrca  in this species is slightly younger than  <dig> thousand years, while the origin of the most frequent clade observed in domestic european breeds  clearly predates the neolithic revolution. this result is compatible with our finding that a pre-neolithic aurochs also had a t sequence. for comparison, the tmrca ages for the same clades were calculated with a  <dig> my calibration point, and compared with results from  <cit> , where the 2my calibration point and simpler statistical methods  were used. as expected from theoretical arguments  <cit> , we found that these simple methods tend to underestimate the clade ages.

the estimated age  of several key monophyletic clades was calculated assuming that the b. taurus - b. bison divergence occurred  <dig> mya  <cit> . this calibration point is compatible with the demographic expansion detected in cattle mitochondrial data resulting from the neolithic domestication event. ages are also calculated assuming that b. taurus - b. bison diverged  <dig> my  <cit> . for comparison, the last column reports the maximum likelihood estimates obtained in a previous study based on the  <dig> my calibration point but a fixed topology  <cit> , with standard errors in parenthesis.

finally, we investigated the effect of adding the italian aurochs genome on the tmrca estimates for mtdna clades, by reanalyzing the data with and without the aurochs sequence. the aim of this analysis is to understand how the addition of this single ancient sequence influences the estimates of the timing of the origin of each clade in the genealogy. we assumed genealogical continuity between ancient and modern samples and applied the single population flexible coalescent model  implemented in beast. under this model, ancient dna sequences from specimens with known age can be appropriately included in the data set, and given the phylogenetic position of the aurochs genome  this analysis appears robust to deviations from the single population assumption. the inclusion of the aurochs genome increased the estimated age of the t clade from  <dig>  ky  to  <dig>  ky . thus, the inclusion of an  <dig> ky-old t haplotype sequence increases the estimated tmrca of the relatively recent t clade by about one third under a coalescent population model. the  <dig>  ky value is compatible with the age estimated from the full european mtdna genome dataset and the phylogenetic approach. as expected, the addition of the aurochs genome has little impact on the estimated tmrcas for the more basal clades. for example, the median tmrca for rpqt and qt estimated with the aurochs genome are  <dig>  ky  and  <dig>  ky  respectively, and  <dig>  ky  and  <dig>  ky  without it.

clearly, more ancient genomes will be necessary to fully investigate the role of aurochs in the crucial time interval following the domestication of cattle. however, the data available so far suggest that the genetic variation in the cattle was strongly affected by a bottleneck during the domestication process followed by an intense demographic expansion, while a constant population size model appears more appropriate for the aurochs dynamic  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the complete bos primigenius mtdna genome generated from an  <dig> ky italian skeleton as part of this study has a genetic distance of  <dig> % from a  <dig> -year-old sample recovered in england  <cit> . while the british genome belongs to the now extremely rare p clade, the italian genome belongs to the t clade, a pre-neolithic homogeneous group of sequences which contains sequences from the vast majority of modern cattle. this supports the view, previously based on short mitochondrial fragments from several mesolithic individuals and modern breeds, that aurochs populations in northern and southern regions were clearly differentiated, and that southern european aurochsen may have played a role during the domestication of modern cattle  <cit> . using a bayesian approach, we also show that the domestication process left a significant trace of rapid demographic expansion in cattle mtdna genomic variation. finally, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that efforts to assign aurochs mitochondrial genomes within specific cattle sub-clades of the t clade may be irrelevant, since the branching pattern within this clade appears to contain several polytomies. this suggests that studies of the domestication process, which essentially involved individuals bearing t mtdna genomes, may be particularly complicated, and are likely to require additional information from nuclear markers.
