BACKGROUND
to find new susceptibility loci for complex diseases on the human genome, a high number of case and control samples is required. an old approach with new perspective is the pooling of cases and controls. the larger the number of analyzed snps, the more striking are the advantages of a pooling study. with advanced microarray technology it is now possible to analyze snps throughout the whole genome. with the human mapping  <dig> k array set from affymetrix and the beadchips from illumina, over  <dig>  snps can be genotyped on two arrays. different groups have tested the reliability of affymetrix microarrays for pooling studies with either the  <dig> k array  <cit>  or the  <dig> k array  <cit> . on these arrays, each snp is interrogated by  <dig> probes . on the  <dig> k arrays over 90% of the snps are represented by only  <dig> probes . this reduction of probes, as well as the reduction of the feature size from  <dig> μm , and  <dig> μm  to  <dig> μm  could have a negative influence on the outcome of pooling results. to examine if this is true, we tested the nsp i  <dig> k array which represents  <dig>  snps and is part of the  <dig> k array set. according to the data sheet from affymetrix, over 85% of the human genome is covered by snps within  <dig> kb distance with this array set. if allelotyping of pooled dna is feasible with these arrays, whole genome association studies including thousands of samples could be performed within a few weeks in a cost-effective manner.

RESULTS
 <dig> k array
to assess the measurement error in our lab, we estimated the allele frequency in a pool of  <dig> dna samples previously genotyped in our lab with the  <dig> k array. we calculated the allele frequency with three methods . as reference data for the correction of unequal allele signals, we took either data generated in our lab  or data from other labs . from  <dig>  snps on the  <dig> k array, the allele frequency of  <dig>  snps could be estimated with all three methods. in table  <dig>  we show the mean and median error , the correlation coefficient between known and estimated allele frequency, and the standard deviation  between the four replicates. as expected, the estimates were better when using the reference data generated in our lab. the ppc method was the most accurate method with a mean error of  <dig> . however, the k-correction with heterozygous ras values gave only slightly worse results with an error of  <dig> . in comparison with other methods the ppc is the only algorithm that uses only perfect match data. to elucidate if the k-correction can be improved by utilizing just perfect match data, we set all cell intensity values in the original cell files to zero. then we derived a perfect-match-ras and reanalyzed the data using the k-correction with heterozygous references. the resulting estimates gave an average error of  <dig> . applying a second degree polynomial on these perfect-match-ras values could reduce the error to  <dig> . however, for "normal" ras values the second degree polynomial did not improve the error.

the errors are based on estimates from  <dig> snps which could be analyzed by all methods.

*data used for normalization: "our" =  <dig> individuals analyzed in our lab, "brohede" =  <dig> individuals analyzed in the lab of brohede et al.  <cit> , "web" > <dig> individuals analyzed in the lab of caig et al.  <cit> , files are available under  <cit> .

 <dig> k array
from the  <dig>  snps on the nsp  <dig> k array, the rs-numbers of  <dig>  snps could be identified from the hapmap ceph population . we excluded  <dig> snps  which had inconsistent genotype information in the two sources . from the remaining snps,  <dig>  had a 100% call rate in the  <dig> hapmap samples. for the evaluation,  <dig>  snps could be used because they had at least one "ab" genotype  in the  <dig> reference samples genotyped in our lab. table  <dig> shows the mean error, the correlation coefficient between known and estimated allele frequency, and the standard deviation between the pool replicates. we also specified how the accuracy depended on the number of pool replicates, the number of reference ras values , the minor allele frequency, and the snp type. as expected, we found that the mean error decreased by the number of pool replicates. the mean error also decreased by the number of "ab" reference samples, and with an increasing minor allele frequency. to see if the error improves with higher allele frequencies only because of a higher number of "ab" references or vice versa, we adjusted both parameters and found the same trend. we could further show that the estimation of the allele frequency in a/t snps was significantly less accurate than in g/c snps . the same trends were found for the  <dig> k array .

*to get the error for different numbers of repeats, we took the mean of all possible combination of the four replicates. for  <dig> replicates for example we took the mean values of pool combinations  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

for the reference samples, arrays with less than 93% call rate were excluded. for pooled dna, however, the call rate normally is around 80%, because many snp frequencies lie between homozygous and heterozygous frequencies. to prove if the call rate can be partially explained by the detection rate , we plotted the call rates against detection rates from  <dig> nsp and  <dig> sty arrays previously analyzed with individual dna in our lab . according to the regression curve, a call rate of 93% corresponds to a detection rate of about  <dig> %. one of our  <dig> k arrays  had a detection rate of  <dig> %. it was therefore considered to be of bad quality and was excluded. this array also had a significantly poorer accuracy . in the other four arrays  a high mdr also correlated with a low error .

discussion
with our data from the  <dig> k array, we could confirm that from the three tested methods, the ppc algorithm  <cit>  gave the best estimates. compared to other methods, this algorithm  utilizes the signal intensities from individual probes ;  it takes only data from the perfect matches;  it applies a second degree polynomial for correction of unequal hybridization; and  it uses reference information from all three genotypes . our results suggest that neither of these parameters alone is responsible for the good performance of the ppc algorithm but the combination of all. however, the need for all three genotypes in the reference samples limits the number of snps that can be estimated. another disadvantage of this method is the time consuming computation in perl and r. this made it impossible to use the algorithm for our  <dig> k data yet. for the nsp  <dig> k array, we used the k-correction with heterozygous ras values. this algorithm performed only slightly worse than the ppc algorithm. it was the simplest of the tested algorithms and it scored for more snps, because homozygous calls were not required. the algorithm proposed by craig et al.  <cit> , also uses ras values and includes reference information of all three genotypes, which should improve the estimation. however, this method gave the worst estimates for our data set. the algorithm used by kirov et al. with a reported average error of only  <dig>  with  <dig> k arrays might improve the allelotyping accuracy for  <dig> k arrays. instead of using heterozygous references, the correction coefficient k is derived from ras values of a pool with known allele frequencies. this algorithm was not applied here, because it requires a second independent dna pool with known allele frequencies. future studies can use our k values  for allele frequency estimation on the  <dig> k nsp arrays. however, results for snps with a very low/high frequency in the reference pool may not be reliable. another approach could be the combination of the ppc algorithm and the algorithm from kirov et al. where k is calculated from pooled data of all perfectly matching probes. to avoid the use of reference data in a case-control study with pooled samples, it is also possible to directly compare the signal intensities of the perfectly matching probes between cases and controls as shown by macgregor et al.  <cit> . in this study, the use of a correction for unequal hybridization signals had only little effect upon the results. however, also slight improvements can be important for the finding of low susceptibility genes in pooling studies.

despite the reduction of the feature number and feature size, the absolute error between real and estimated allele frequency with the  <dig> k array was as low as the one for the  <dig> k array when using simpson's k-correction. the correlation between real and estimated allele frequency was even higher with the  <dig> k array, and the standard deviation was lower. however, our results from the  <dig> k and the  <dig> k array are not directly comparable, because  pools were constructed from different dna samples,  the experimental protocol was different,  different scanners were used for both chips, and  the software used for data extraction was different.

as shown in table  <dig>  the accuracy of the allele frequency estimation improved with the number of pool replicates. the absolute error between three and four replicates only decreased by  <dig> . therefore, we assume that the addition of further technical replicates would not essentially improve the accuracy. in our study, we used pools of identical samples. however, for a case-control study, it might be of advantage to use pools of independent samples to capture the variance between the individuals. in this case, an increase of replicates can improve the accuracy. with increasing number of "ab" references, the error decreased to  <dig>  when  <dig> references were present. in our study, the mean error was smaller when the minor allele frequency was higher. this was also true for the  <dig> k results using the ppc algorithm, which is in contrast to the results published by brohede et al.  <cit> , where the best estimates were obtained at minor allele frequencies < <dig> . interestingly, the accuracy of a/t snps was found to be significantly worse than the accuracy of g/c snps on the  <dig> k array. this is probably due to the higher affinity of the g-c hydrogen bound compared to the a-t bound. for the stability of the entire hybridization complex, an unspecific hybridization with "a" or "t" is relatively less important than with "g" or "c". here we analyzed only one of the two  <dig> k arrays from the  <dig> k set. the only difference between the two arrays is the cleavage side in the first fragmentation step. therefore, we assume that both arrays, nsp and sty, perform equally well.

pooling of samples has several disadvantages compared to a case-control study analyzing individual genotypes:  associations which do not result in a significant change of the allele frequency can be overlooked;  measurement errors can lead to false results;  stratification of the population by age, sex, disease subtype, etc. has to be done before the analysis;  haplotype analysis is only possible under certain conditions  <cit> ; and  analysis of gene-gene interactions can not be performed. however, with advancing technologies and algorithms, the mean measurement error can probably be reduced to values <  <dig>   <cit> . the use of linkage information should improve the likelihood of finding "real" associations and detect false positive snps. taking the hapmap information  for the  <dig> k array, we found ~30% of the snps to be linked to its downstream snp ; with the  <dig> k array set it was ~50%. with this high linkage, the allele frequency of one snp can be partly explained by the allele frequency of a linked snp. to take advantage of this fact, two recent publications propose to use p-value combinations in a sliding-window concept  <cit> . with increasing number of analyzed snps and better linkage information most haplotypes can be explained by individual snps  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we think that dna pooling might be a useful and affordable tool to detecting new candidate genes for genetic diseases, especially at a whole genome level. however, this has to be proven in future association studies with pooled dna.
