BACKGROUND
modern drug discovery is time-consuming and expensive, involving coordinated multi-disciplinary research in multiple stages, each requiring intensive and specialized resources  <cit> . although rapid advancement of “omics” approaches, computational systems biology and accumulation of digital data resources have provided a vast array of significant information in life science  <cit> , data relevant to drug discovery are not easily identified and recruited for application to pharmaceutical research  <cit> . despite the technological advances in drug discovery such as hts, the approval of new drugs has remained stagnant in the past decade, resulting in an overall decline in the productivity of` the pharmaceutical industry.

in efforts to save development time and minimize the risk of failure during drug develo pment, repositioning of currently available drugs to new therapeutic indications is considered an alternative route  <cit> . to date most repositioned drugs have been the consequence of serendipitous observations of unexpected efficacy and side effects of drugs in development or on the market. however, recently, systems biology approaches have been applied in efforts to discover unknown effects for existing drugs. for instance, drug repositioning approaches have incorporated in silico approaches for analyzing large data sets such as gene expression profiles  <cit> , literature mining  <cit> , chemical similarity  <cit> , side-effect similarity  <cit> , disease-drug network  <cit> , pathway-based disease network  <cit> , and phenotypic disease network  <cit> . to establish a more logical approach to repositioning a known drug to a new indication, we established a knowledge platform comprising binary linkages between diseases, drugs, and proteins, from which new and previously unknown connections can be drawn between drugs and diseases of interest. this integrated database was designated pharmdb.

for probing the database and identifying disease-drug linkages, we have developed the shared neighborhood scoring  algorithm, which predicts relationships between drugs, proteins and diseases. while the relationship data are collected from experiments, coverage of the data is still incomplete. thus there may be undetected links and hidden nodes in the network. up to now, a number of prediction methods and measures have been proposed to find these undetected associations from topological or structural properties of various complex networks  <cit> . to date, most of these algorithms and measures are applicable only to a monopartite network that consists only of one type of node. therefore, multipartite network composed of more than a type of nodes cannot be analyzed using these measures. to solve this problem, researchers have used projection methods that convert multipartite networks into monopartite ones. unfortunately, any projection method can result in information loss, especially in low-degree nodes. accordingly projecting the pharmdb tripartite network into monopartite drug, protein and disease networks can distort many well-known network measures, such as average path length < l>, average clustering coefficient < c>, degree-dependent clustering coefficient c, degree distribution p, assortativity coefficient r  <cit> , and degree-degree correlation coefficient knn  <cit> . to overcome these limits of the projection technique, we designed a new prediction method called shared neighborhood scoring  algorithm which calculates the probability of a link existence between two nodes of interest. this can be done by evaluating the connections of their neighbors in pharmdb tripartite network.

RESULTS
system overview
the pharmdb is a tripartite pharmacological network database consisting of three kinds of nodes: human diseases, fda approved drugs or druggable chemicals, and proteins. the proteins in pharmdb include therapeutic targets, disease-associated proteins, and drug-metabolizing proteins. the nodes and links used to construct this network database were imported from nine public databases, namely, entrezgene interaction  <cit> , mint  <cit> , dip  <cit> , ctd  <cit> , ttd  <cit> , chembank  <cit> , pharmgkb  <cit> , omim  <cit> , and gad  <cit>  .

although these individual databases provide information about the relationships between drugs, diseases, and proteins, they do not provide an integrated network map among the three components in an interactive manner. for data integration in a unified format, we adopted pubchem cid for drugs, geneid for proteins , and mesh descriptor for diseases . pharmdb currently includes the nodes of  <dig>  drugs,  <dig>  proteins, and  <dig>  diseases. it also contains  <dig>  drug-protein,  <dig>  protein-disease, and  <dig>  drug-disease,  <dig>  protein-protein links. the contents of the tripartite pharmacological network in pharmdb are provided through a website . phexplorer, a graphical data visualization software program is also provided for interactive browsing of relevant data. for constructing workflows, pharmdb is provided in biomart format . currently, software for finding the shortest path between two nodes is only provided through the website.

shared neighborhood scoring  algorithm
the concept of sns algorithm is similar to swanson’s abc model, which applies the transitivity rule to discover missing knowledge from biomedical literature  <cit> . the sns algorithm is based on the observation that the probability of connection between two nodes shows monotonic increase with “shared nodes count”, the number of in-between nodes connecting two nodes . further we calculated weights for all possible pairs of the network. first we assigned weight  <dig> to each connected pairs directly linked between two nodes. if a pair of two nodes is not connected, the connection probability is assigned as weight for this indirect link or a virtual link between two nodes. as shown in the figure  <dig>  the connection probability for given “shared nodes count” can be computed to be the fraction of directly connected pairs among the total number of pairs having the given “shared nodes count”. finally we developed the share neighborhood score  by summing up “shared nodes count”, the number of shared nodes and “shared nodes weight”, the product of each weight of  links bridging the two end nodes . as the sn score possesses a range of values in each relation category , we developed a normalization method using the connecting probability function of sn score distribution .

we compared the “shared nodes count” distribution for connected pairs and unconnected pairs. connected pairs shared more neighborhood nodes than unconnected pairs. the p-values of the kolmogorov-smirnov  test are less than  <dig> e- <dig> in all three relation categories, meaning that connected pairs and unconnected pairs have significantly distinct distribution .

the prediction performance of the sns algorithm was measured by plotting receiver operating characteristic  curves . for calculating sn scores, “simple algorithm” considers only “shared nodes count” but “extended algorithm” includes both “shared nodes count” and “shared nodes weight”. as shown in the figure  <dig>  the extended algorithm shows better performance than simple one. auc values of simple algorithm are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , in drug-protein relation, drug-disease relation, and protein-disease relation, respectively. and auc values for extended algorithm are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . according to the result, prediction performances with extended scope of shared neighborhood nodes were improved by 38%, 12%, and 45%, respectively.

case study – benzthiazide as a potential agent for lung cancer
as a case study, we chose squamous cell carcinoma  , a subtype of lung cancer, and tested whether pharmdb could identify any drugs that have a potential for treating this type of cancer. for the primary selection of drug candidates in this case, we made the following criteria. first, they should be inferred by sns algorithm with sn score bigger than  <dig>  and share nodes count zero. second, they should belong to fda approved drugs. third, they should not have been previously used for cancer drug. forth, they should be directly linked to cancer target proteins . twenty eight common drugs fit to the four criteria above and were suggested as potential scc drug candidates . we then went over these candidates to choose the one for experimental validation. considering technical feasibility, availability of materials, intellectual property and potential for new drug development, we decided to examine thia-benzthiazide  whether it can be used for scc treatment. tbzt is a kind of thiazide diurectic used for the treatment of high blood pressure and edema  <cit> . to validate a potential of tbzt as a lung cancer drug, we administered different concentrations of tbzt to squamous lung cancer cells  under hypoxic conditions , as well as under normoxic conditions  <cit> . their effects on cell proliferation were monitored by  thymidine incorporation. we found that under hypoxic conditions only, tbzt can suppress proliferation of cancer cell in a dose-dependent manner . the hypoxia-dependent cell death induced by tbzt was further confirmed by flow cytometry .

carbonic anhydrases  are zinc metalloenzymes which catalyze the conversion of carbon dioxide to the bicarbonate ion and protons. the cas are involved in many biological and physical processes including ph homeostasis and have  <dig> mammalian isoforms   <cit> . in pharmdb, tbzt is linked to carbonic anhydrase  <dig> . however, tbzt can suppress proliferation of lung cancer cell under hypoxic conditions only  and the expression of ca <dig> is not associated with hypoxic conditions. so we have extended cancer-linked ca isoforms in pharmdb . as a result, we considered three different human ca isozymes  as targets of tbzt, and tested whether tbzt inhibits ca activity. tbzt suppressed all of the three ca isozymes with similar ki values . as a positive control, acetazolamide , a known inhibitor of carbonic anhydrases , was also used  <cit> . aza also suppressed the activities of the three cas, although the ki values varied depending on the target enzymes. however, among the ca isozymes, ca <dig> is known to be induced in hypoxic conditions and has functional association with cancer  <cit> . thus, the efficacy of tbzt against hcc- <dig> cells is likely to have resulted from its inhibition of ca <dig>  for that reasons, we decided to focus on ca <dig> as the major effective target of tbzt against cancer although we do not exclude the involvement of other isozymes.

ca <dig>  a carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme, is a transmembrane protein that plays an important role in ph regulation  <cit> . the expression of ca <dig> is highly induced in various cancers under hypoxic conditions, which is functionally important for the growth and survival of tumor cells  <cit> . we confirmed whether ca <dig> is actually induced in hypoxic conditions by western blotting with its specific antibody in hcc- <dig>  as expected, ca <dig> levels were significantly increased in hypoxic conditions  compared with those in normoxic conditions  . we also confirmed that tbzt induced cell death by measuring the activation of caspase  <dig> . to confirm the drug-protein pair relationship between ca <dig> and tbzt, we tested whether the forced expression of ca <dig> would compensate for the anti-proliferative activity of ca <dig> by the treatment of tbzt under hypoxic conditions. cell proliferation was reduced to 70% of the control cells by the treatment of tbzt in the cells transfected with ev, but 35% of the control cells in the cells transfected with ca <dig>  therefore, the exogenous supplementation of ca <dig> recovered the proliferation by up to 35% . this result validates that the anti-proliferative activity of tbzt against hcc- <dig> cells mainly involves ca <dig>  perhaps, the remaining part could be contributed by other ca isozymes that are also involved in the regulation of cancer. even if further chemical optimization of tbzt is required to improve efficacy and specificity, these results suggest a possible application of tbzt for further development against lung cancer through its ca <dig> inhibitory activity.

discussion
this study demonstrates that drug repositioning can be rapidly guided by a knowledge platform pharmdb, a pharmacological network database comprising protein, drug, and disease data which we are providing as a web-based service. as an ever-increasing amount of biological and pharmacological data are scattered throughout the literature and in proprietary databases, the integrated data of pharmdb provides a valuable tool by consolidating certain valuable sets of data. we adopted a tripartite pharmacological network-based analysis, and developed a novel neighborhood scoring algorithm to predict previously unknown relationships between drugs, proteins and diseases. the theoretical foundation of algorithm is that a connection probability between two nodes is proportional to the number of nodes commonly shared between them. so the connection probability of two indirectly linked nodes was computed, which is called the shared neighborhood score. this score can highlight missing linkages which may either result from “no actual connection” or “lack of information” and help to differentiate between these two possibilities.

we experimentally validated the usefulness of the shared neighborhood score by identifying a hitherto unknown drug-protein relationship and potential new indication based on this connection. aside from drug repositioning, the network map of pharmdb composed of not only the data integrated from diverse databases but also the predicted data using the shared neighborhood algorithm can applied to other purposes, such as the prediction of drug mode-of-action, off-target effects, and even the design of optimal drug combinations for a disease of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
pharmdb, an integrated tripartite database, coupled with shared neighborhood scoring  algorithm, would provide much more enriched information than general integrated databases and give us clues for finding new indication of known drugs. furthermore, these data can be easily explored with phexplorer and accessed via biomart web service .
