BACKGROUND
enterococci are opportunistic pathogens of the normal intestinal microbiota of humans and animals  <cit> . the most common species of enterococcus involved in nosocomial infections is enterococcus faecium   <cit> . this pathogen is associated with hospital-acquired infections such as utis , wounds, bacteremia, endocarditis and meningitis  <cit> .

in recent years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant e. faecium has increased  <cit> . the recommended treatment for enterococcus infections has been penicillin alone or combined with aminoglycosides. however, due to increased resistance to aminoglycosides, vancomycin is currently the antibiotic employed to treat these infections. in the last several decades, the number of vancomycin-resistant enterococci  has increased. the first vre isolates were reported in the united kingdom in the late 1980s  <cit> . in the united states, more than 80% of e. faecium isolates from hospitals are now resistant to vancomycin, and virtually all of them  exhibit ampicillin resistance  <cit> . vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium  has been associated with outbreaks in hospitals worldwide  <cit> . the rates of vref colonization and infection have risen steadily, with most cases being caused by strains displaying glycopeptide resistance to vana and vanb  <cit> .

in addition to multidrug resistance, e. faecium produces diverse factors that contribute to its pathogenesis, including virulence molecules such as secreted antigen saga  <cit> , cell wall-anchored collagen adhesin   <cit> , hyaluronidase   <cit>  and enterococcal surface protein   <cit> . however, the traits that contribute to the transition of e. faecium from a commensal to a nosocomial pathogen have not been identified  <cit> .

molecular typing methods are essential for identifying hospital-associated outbreaks of e. faecium. multilocus sequence typing  has revealed the existence of host-specific genogroups, including a specific genetic lineage designated clonal complex  <dig>  associated with hospital-related isolates  <cit> . mlst of e. faecium is based on identifying alleles from dna sequences in internal fragments of housekeeping genes , resulting in a numeric allelic profile, with each profile then being assigned a sequence type   <cit> .

complex  <dig> most likely evolved from the primary e. faecium ancestor st- <dig>  while st- <dig> represents an important secondary founder with additional linages designated to complex  <dig>  <cit> . clonal complex  <dig> is characterized by ampicillin and quinolone resistance and the presence of a putative pathogenicity island that includes the esp and/or hyl genes in the majority of isolates  <cit> . various sts belonging to clonal complex  <dig>  such as st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  are currently being disseminated worldwide  <cit> . interestingly, half of the sts within the clonal complex  <dig> polyclonal subpopulation have also been identified in samples obtained from healthy humans, swine, poultry and pets  <cit> .

in mexico, there is little available information about the prevalence of vref isolates, and no study related to clonal complex  <dig> has been performed in pediatric patients. the aim of this study was to genotypically and phenotypically characterize vref clinical isolates from  <dig> immunocompromised pediatric patients at the hospital infantil de méxico federico gómez . this study involved amplification of the resistance genes vana and vanb and two virulence genes  and molecular typing via pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and mlst.

methods
bacterial isolates
twelve e. faecium isolates of clinical importance were obtained from  <dig> patients with nosocomial infections in the picu , oncology, gastroenterology and transplant wards of himfg during the period from july  <dig> to april  <dig>  the isolates were maintained at −70°c in skim milk  and cultured on 5% sheep blood agar plates  at 37°c under 5% co <dig> for 24 h. the e. faecalis atcc®  <dig>  e. faecalis atcc®  <dig> and e. faecium atcc®  <dig> strains  were used as controls.

biochemical tests
bacteria were grown on blood agar, and identification was performed using manual methods. all colonies were grown in brain heart infusion broth   with  <dig> % nacl and on bile esculin agar  to determine their hydrolysis grade. disks impregnated with the substrate l-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide were used to perform pyrrolidonase tests . reduction of tellurite  was evaluated via growing the bacteria on  <dig> % potassium tellurite.

antibiotic susceptibility
the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the  <dig> vref isolates were determined via the minimum inhibitory concentration  technique by means of the microdilution method using mueller-hinton broth , as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. mic tests were performed for vancomycin , teicoplanin , chloramphenicol , ciprofloxacin , streptomycin , linezolid , rifampicin , nitrofurantoin , tetracycline , doxycycline , erythromycin , tigecycline , gentamicin  and amoxicillin-clavulanate . several concentrations  of the antibiotics were tested in mueller hinton broth, with 100 μl of those dilutions being loaded into each well of a microplate. for each dilution, 100 μl of a bacterial suspension  was inoculated and grown overnight at 37°c under a co <dig> atmosphere. after bacterial growth was detected, the mic for each isolate of e. faecium was reported as the highest concentration  of antibiotics in which no growth was observed. the e. faecalis atcc®  <dig> strain  was used as a control. these isolates were also evaluated for high-level aminoglycoside resistance  to streptomycin  and gentamicin .

detection of the glycopeptide resistance genes vana and vanb
pcr was performed to detect the glycopeptide resistance genes vana and vanb in the  <dig> e. faecium clinical isolates using specific primers   <cit> . briefly, genomic dna was purified using the wizard genomic dna purification kit  from a bacterial culture grown in bhi broth incubated at 37°c for 24 h. the amplification reactions were prepared in a final volume of 50 μl, as follows: 25 μl of amplification mix , 100 ng/μl of bacterial dna, 10 μl of h2o and 5 μl of primer solution . a perkin elmer  <dig> thermocycler was programmed to run for 30 cycles with the following parameters: denaturing at 94°c for 3 m, annealing at 55°c for 45 s and extension at 72°c for 1 m, with a final extension at 72°c for 2 m. the samples were analyzed via electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels  using a 100 bp dna ladder . e. faecium strain atcc  <dig>  and e. faecalis strain atcc®  <dig>  were used as controls in the pcr experiments  <cit> .

dna from bacterial cultures was extracted and amplified via pcr using primers for the espefm and hylefm genes , generating bands of 954 bp and 661 bp, respectively  <cit> .

molecular typing of vref
pfge of the  <dig> vref clinical isolates was carried out following the protocols of morrison et al.  <cit> . briefly, the samples were digested with  <dig> u of smai  for 4 h at 25°c. the digested plugs were separated via electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels  using ultra-pure dna agarose , with  <dig> x tbe as the running buffer in the chef mapper system , run at 6 v/cm at 14°c under two different linear ramped pulse times:  <dig> to 10 s for 16 h and  <dig> to 40 s for 22 h. a pfge lambda ladder  was used as a molecular weight marker, and the gels were stained for 40 m with  <dig>  mg/ml of ethidium bromide for visualization under uv light. the obtained banding patterns were initially interpreted via visual inspection according to the criteria specified by tenover et al.  <cit> . cluster analysis was performed with bionumerics  using the dice correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group mathematical average algorithm  as the grouping method  <cit> .

the pfge pulsotypes of the  <dig> vref clinical isolates were also genotyped through multilocus sequence typing  according to a standard protocol described by homan et al.  <cit> . fragments of seven housekeeping genes  were sequenced using a 3730xl dna analyzer , thus obtaining their allelic profiles, and the sts for each unique allelic profile were designated on the basis of information from the mlst website .

the vana and vanb genes of the  <dig> vref clinical isolates were amplified via pcr. interestingly, only the vana gene was detected in all the vref clinical isolates, as a  <dig>  bp amplicon , whereas the vanb gene, with a length of 433 bp, was not identified in the isolates . the e. faecium atcc®  <dig>  and e. faecalis atcc®  <dig>  strains were used as positive controls in the pcr assays  <cit> .

prevalence of the esp and hyl virulence genes in the vref isolates
the esp and hyl virulence genes, which are associated with a clonal subcluster known as clonal complex  <dig> in vref clinical isolates, were detected via pcr. the esp and hyl genes were highly prevalent in the isolates. the esp virulence gene was detected in  <dig> %  of the isolates, and the hyl virulence gene was present in 50%  of them. therefore, three genotypes were determined for the vref clinical isolates: esp+/hyl-, esp+/hyl+ and esp-/hyl+, at prevalence rates of 50% ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively.

molecular typing analysis of the e. faecium isolates via pfge and mlst
the vref isolates were analyzed via pfge following smai digestion of genomic dna. data obtained through pfge were analyzed using a dendrogram profile, which included the pfge pulsotypes obtained from vref . a total of four clusters  with five dna pulsotypes were identified, showing patterns consisting of  <dig> to  <dig> dna fragments ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb . interestingly, 25%  of the vref clinical isolates observed via pfge were categorized as pulsotype b and  <dig> %  as pulsotype b <dig>  with 92% genetic similarity being observed among these isolates . meanwhile, 25%  of the vref isolates were classified as pulsotype a, showing a different pattern from pulsotypes b, c and d . however,  <dig> %  of the vref isolates were classified as pulsotypes c and d, which displayed 50% genetic similarity. in addition, a maximum of 44% similarity was observed among all clusters of vref isolates.

in this study,  <dig> vref clinical isolates were subjected to mlst genotyping. six of the  <dig> vref isolates  belonged to st <dig>  three to st <dig>  two to st <dig> and one to st <dig> . eburst analysis of the vref isolates revealed four different sts , three of which belonged to clonal complex 17; st <dig> was not related to this clonal complex .

discussion
e. faecium is a highly resistant nosocomial pathogen and has recently emerged as an important threat in hospitals worldwide  <cit> . in this study, the  <dig> examined vref isolates exhibited multidrug resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, erythromycin and teicoplanin. at himfg, several types of enterococcal infections in pediatric patients are commonly treated with a combination of drugs  as the first choice, while vancomycin is the second choice; vancomycin-aminoglycoside or linezolid is the third choice; and tigecycline is the fourth choice. interestingly,  <dig> %  of the vref clinical isolates were also resistant to linezolid, and 67%  were resistant to both tetracycline and doxycycline. the emergence of high levels of resistance to the most common anti-enterococcal antibiotics  might constitute a real challenge in the treatment of these infections. in the present study, 100%  of the examined vref isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and nitrofurantoin. the vref resistance patterns observed in this study are in agreement with the findings of other authors  <cit> . however, these authors observed vref isolates that were susceptible to linezolid and nitrofurantoin, in contrast to our data, which showed that two of the vref isolates were resistant to linezolid. nevertheless, the low resistance to linezolid observed in the vref clinical isolates is in accord with data reported in other countries  <cit> .

few instances of the isolation of hlar e. faecium have been documented worldwide  <cit> . in this study, the examined vref clinical isolates showed hlar to gentamicin , streptomycin  and gentamicin/streptomycin , displaying resistance values of 50%, 25% and 25%, respectively. treatment of severe enterococcal infection requires combined therapy to achieve a synergistic bactericidal effect  <cit> . however, the results obtained in cases of severe infections associated with enterococci have shown that hlar should not be treated with combined therapy   <cit> . therefore, the treatment of hlar e. faecium is restricted  <cit> .

the enterococcal surface protein esp, which is encoded by genes that appear to have been acquired and localized within a pathogenicity island, is commonly found in clinical isolates and anchors to the cell wall. this protein also affects biofilm formation and plays a role in experimental uti and/or endocarditis models  <cit> . the presence of the esp gene has been associated with hospital outbreaks, although this gene is not exclusively found in epidemic strains  <cit> . the esp gene was detected in  <dig> % of our vref clinical isolates. in addition, the majority of esp+ strains of e. faecium isolates were multidrug-resistant to more than three antibiotics, in accord with data reported by other researchers  <cit> .

on the other hand, the hyl gene was found in 50% of the vref clinical isolates and displayed a higher prevalence compared to the prevalences of  <dig> %  reported in isolates of e. faecium in the picardy region of france, 38%  in isolates from the us and 3% in european clinical isolates. however, in the united kingdom, a hyl gene prevalence of 71%  was observed in e. faecium isolates  <cit> . we believe that the differences observed in the detection rates of the hyl gene are due to the region in which the samples were isolated. the rates of the occurrence of esp+/hyl-, esp+/hyl+ and esp-/hyl+ isolates were found to be 50% ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, which is in accord with the findings of vankerckhoven et al. and rice et al.  <cit> . the vref clinical isolates of mexican origin in which the esp and/or hyl gene was amplified , were resistant to more than three antibiotics; in contrast, other studies have shown a significant correlation between the presence of the esp gene and resistance to ampicillin, imipenem and ciprofloxacin  <cit> .

pfge and mlst analyses have been proposed as alternative methods for the molecular characterization of clinical isolates of e. faecium <cit> . according to our pfge analysis, the  <dig> vref isolates showed a heterogeneous pattern associated with a profile of multidrug resistance to different antibiotics and the presence of the vana gene. the data obtained through pfge revealed four clusters , with a low similarity of 44% being detected among the vref isolates and therefore high diversity. furthermore, the vref isolates within clusters i, ii-b and iii showed an identical banding profile in the pfge analysis. however, the mlst data indicated different sts due to changes in the nucleotide sequences of the analyzed housekeeping genes; these data are consistent with the findings of poh et al.  <cit> . in addition, the vref isolates within clusters ii-b <dig> and iv displayed identical pfge and mlst profiles, in agreement with other authors  <cit> . nevertheless, pulsotypes from different wards showed similar multidrug resistance profiles, possibly due to horizontal genetic transference between these isolates.

mlst is an important tool for studying the molecular epidemiology of outbreaks of e. faecium and microbial population biology  <cit> . mlst analysis of vref clinical isolates revealed four sts: st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  as previously reported, clonal complex  <dig> harbors various sts that have been involved in hospital outbreaks. our results revealed two allelic profiles, st <dig> and st <dig>  belonging to clonal complex  <dig> sts involved in hospital outbreaks. however, clonal complex  <dig> has been resolved into two different subgroups, one of which harbors st <dig> and st <dig>  while the second harbors st <dig>  <cit> . st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> are the major groups in the genetic lineage of e. faecium; they are distributed worldwide and have been associated with outbreaks  <cit> . st <dig> was the most frequent sequence type found in the vref isolates from himfg and was genetically linked to the st <dig> lineage. interestingly, st <dig> has been identified worldwide and associated with outbreaks  <cit> . according to the eburst analysis, st <dig> showed characteristics of the sts belonging to the  <dig> lineage. st <dig> has not been characterized within clonal complex  <dig>  in addition, st <dig> displayed resistance markers , virulence genes  and the purk <dig> allele; however, it has not been associated with outbreaks. nevertheless, this community of multidrug-resistant strains is able to infect humans and might contribute to the spreading of these bacteria in the hospital, highlighting the importance of molecular typing via mlst to identify sts involved in nosocomial outbreaks.

recently, it was shown that mlst analysis of typified e. faecium based on selected alleles may generate misleading results due to the recombination of five alleles . as only the purk and adk alleles are located in regions where there is no predicted recombination, the results must be interpreted with care  <cit> . the genome of e. faecium is highly plastic due to the few existing barriers to the acquisition of foreign genetic elements  <cit> . recent studies have provided evidence of high levels of recombination through comparative genomics analyses  <cit> . whole-genome sequencing platforms are superior to conventional typing methods, providing an excellent tool for determining phylogenies and regions of recombination and for accurately discriminating between outbreak- and non-outbreak-causing vref isolates  <cit> . thus, whole-genome sequence information, rather than data on just one or a few genes, could be used to distinguish between closely related strains.

in this study, mlst and pfge analysis were applied for the molecular characterization of clinical vref isolates to identify different clonal complexes with different pulsotypes that were not related to outbreaks. however, according to the results obtained through pfge, four multidrug-resistant clones of vref were identified at himfg; in addition, these vref isolates were identified at different periods. therefore, these data suggest that these clones have circulated endemically at himfg.

in the case of cluster ii, the clones have evolved from cluster ii-b to cluster ii-b <dig> due to the high similarity  observed via pfge analysis and based on the acquisition of three bands for b <dig>  suggesting a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer. the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of monitoring circulating vref isolates in different wards of this institution to efficiently control multidrug resistance and prevent outbreaks of these clones.

CONCLUSIONS
little is known about vref isolates in mexican hospitals. in this study, the detected virulence genes , multidrug profiles and allelic patterns were associated with clonal complex  <dig> vref clinical isolates obtained from pediatric patients at himfg. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing clonal complex  <dig> vref isolates in a tertiary care center in mexico city.

multidrug resistance and genetic determinants of virulence confer advantages in vref in the colonization of their hosts. the genome of e. faecium is highly plastic, showing an ability to readily acquire genes involved in environmental persistence, colonization and virulence, favoring the selection of specific clonal complexes in a hospital environment. therefore, the prevention and control of the propagation of nosocomial infections caused by vref is crucial for identifying new emergent subclones that could be challenging to treat in subsequent years.
