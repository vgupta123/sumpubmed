BACKGROUND
xylan is the second most abundant renewable resource in nature, following cellulose. it is composed of a backbone of β- <dig> -linked d-xylopyranose residues, and its side chain is modified by different groups, such as acetate, d-glucuronate, 4-o-methyl-d-glucuronate, and α-l-arabinofuranose  <cit> . because of its complex structure, the complete degradation of xylan requires the cooperative action of a variety of enzymes. among them, endo-β- <dig>  4-xylanase  is the crucial enzyme to randomly hydrolyze β- <dig> -xylosidic linkages of xylan to xylooligosaccharides  <cit> . based on hydrophobic cluster analysis and amino acid sequence similarities, xylanases are mainly classified into glycoside hydrolase  families  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . due to their ability to degrade xylan, xylanases have potential biotechnological applications in many fields  <cit> . a major application of xylanases is in the paper industry, in which the enzyme can reduce the amount of toxic chlorine-containing chemicals and improve the pulp brightness  <cit> . for example, pretreatment with cartazyme hs- <dig> could reduce the chlorine consumption by 31 % at c-stage and 30 % reduction in total organochlorine content in the extraction stage effluent. the brightness was increased by  <dig>  points in ceh sequence  <cit> .

family  <dig> xylanases can easily penetrate cellulose fiber networks without damaging the fibers because of their small molecular mass  and cellulase-free activity. therefore, they are more suitable for the pulp bleaching process than family  <dig> enzymes  <cit> . because the pulp bleaching process is usually in a high temperature  and high ph  environment  <cit> , the xylanases for this application are required to be thermophilic, thermostable, alkaliphilic, and alkali-stable  <cit> . although many xylanases have been cloned and characterized , few xylanases were found to be active and stable in the high temperature and alkaline condition. therefore, engineering the native enzymes to achieve high activity and stability at high temperature and ph is in great demand.

although many attempts on the modification of xylanases by rational design or directed evolution have been successful, such as increasing the optimal temperature or the catalytic activity of the enzyme , research on the improvement of alkalophilicity of the xylanase is limited  <cit> . most of the mutations decreased the optimal ph of the enzyme  <cit> , or only shifted the optimum from acidity to neutrality rather than to the alkaline range  <cit> . introducing excess arginine residues on the protein surface could increase the optimal ph of xylanase xynj from aklaliphilic bacillus sp. 41m- <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> , but we could not replicate the result with the equivalent mutational change in the other xylanse in our previous study.

in the previous study, an alkaline xylanase xyn11a-lc from bacillus sp. sn <dig> was characterized  <cit> . it exhibited the highest catalytic activity at ph <dig> , but little enzyme activity could be detected at ph  <dig> . this property was not suitable for the pulp bleaching process. the three dimensional structure of xylanase xyn11a-lc has been determined  <cit> . the molecular basis of alkaline adaptation of family  <dig> xylanase has been revealed  <cit> . these studies will contribute to engineer non-alkaline xylanase to function at a higher ph condition, but it is still hard to further improve the alkalophilicity of an alkaline xylanase by rational protein design. in this study, in order to obtain more alkaline mutants, a random mutation library of xylanase xyn11a-lc was constructed by error-prone pcr. one mutant with improved alkalophilicity was obtained by a high-throughput screening system. site-directed mutations and site-saturation mutagenesis were then carried out to validate the key role of the residue at position  <dig> on the ph activity profile of xyn11a-lc. the mechanism of alkaline adaptation of the mutant was discussed by structural analysis.

RESULTS
construction and screening of random mutagenesis libraries
over  <dig>  colonies were obtained from the random mutagenesis libraries. about  <dig> transformants showing clear halos on the medium with remazol brilliant blue xylan  were picked into 96-well plates for screening for the mutants with improved alkalophilicity. the selection criterion was an increase of at least 10 % in the ph 10/ph  <dig>  activity ratio of the mutants compared to that of the wild type. for the second screening, a total of  <dig> mutants showing higher ratio than that of the wild type were obtained. then, according to the ph activity profiles of crude enzymes of the wild type and  <dig> mutants,  <dig> mutants with improved alkalophilicity were obtained in the third screening. for the fourth screening, one mutant m52-c <dig> with improved alkalophilicity was obtained from above mentioned  <dig> mutants by determining ph activity profiles of the purified enzymes . m52-c <dig> exhibited an optimal activity at ph  <dig>  and corresponded to a basic shift of  <dig>  ph units compared to the wild-type enzyme. furthermore, the relative activities of mutant m52-c <dig> increased by  <dig>   <dig>  8 % at ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .fig.  <dig> sds–page analysis of the purified xylanase xyn11a-lc and mutants. lane m, the protein molecular mass markers; lane 1– <dig>  the purified recombinant xyn11a-lc, m52-c <dig>  e135v and e135r, respectively




mutation site analysis
dna sequencing showed that the mutant m52-c <dig> had two mutations, v116a and e135v. site-directed mutagenesis revealed that only the e135v mutation showed the improvement of alkalophilicity . the optimal ph of the mutant e135v increased to ph  <dig> , which was  <dig>  ph units higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. compared to the relative activities of the wild type enzyme, those of the mutant e135v increased by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. nevertheless, the ph activity profile of the mutant v116a was similar to that of the wild type enzyme. according to the above results, it could be concluded that glu  <dig> might be one of the key residues involved in determining the ph activity profile of xyn11a-lc.

in order to get more information about the influence of glu  <dig> on the ph activity profile of xyn11a-lc and to obtain more alkalophilic mutant, site-saturation mutagenesis was carried out by overlap extension pcr. the result showed that the only mutant to have better alkalophilicity than e135v was e135r. its optimal ph was  <dig> ,  <dig>  ph units higher than that of e135v. mutations e135h, e135k, e135q, e135m, e135y and e135a exhibited maximal activity at ph  <dig> , similar to the mutant e135v. the optimal ph of e135p was  <dig> ,  <dig>  ph units lower than that of the wild-type. the ten other mutations exhibited maximal activity at ph  <dig> , similar to the wild-type .fig.  <dig> effects of ph and temperature on the activity and stability of the recombinant xyn11a-lc and mutants. a effect of ph on the activity of xyn11a-lc and mutants. the assay was performed in different ph buffer ranging from ph  <dig>  to ph  <dig>  at optimal temperature for 10 min. b effect of ph on the stability of xyn11a-lc and mutants. the enzyme was diluted in different buffer  at 37 °c for an hour, and the residual activities were measured at the optimal condition for 10 min. the activity of the purified enzyme without pre-incubation was set as 100 %. c effect of temperature on the activity of xyn11a-lc and mutants. the assay was performed at different temperature ranging from  <dig> to 70 °c for 10 min. d effect of temperature on the stability of xyn11a-lc and mutants. the purified enzymes were incubated in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer  without substrate for 30 min at 60 °c, respectively and taken out every 5 min. the residual xylanase activities were measured under the optimal condition for 10 min. the 0 min value was set as 100 %




characterization of the mutants and the wild type enzyme
to further elucidate the effects of glu  <dig> site substitutions on enzyme characterization, other characterizations of the wild type and the mutants were determined. the mutants e135v and e135r were both stable over a broad ph range, retained over 80 % of original activity after incubation at 37 °c for 1 h over a ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , while the wild-type enzyme was stable only at alkaline ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the optimal temperatures of the mutants m52-c <dig>  e135v and e135r were all 55 °c, which was similar to that of the wild type. however, the mutants exhibited higher relative activity at the temperature range of 30–70 °c . in addition, the thermostability of the mutants was also determined. after incubation at 60 °c for 30 min, the mutants m52-c <dig>  e135v and e135r retained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of their maximal activities, respectively, while the wild type enzyme only retained  <dig>  % of its activity under the same conditions . this result showed that the displacement of the negative charge on the surface increased the thermostability of xylanase xyn11a-lc.

structural analyses of the mutants
some amino acid residues close to the catalytic residues  are presumed to be responsible for the ph activity profile of xyn11a-lc by changing the electrostatic potential of the active site  <cit> . however, the residue glu  <dig> is far away from the two catalytic residues . the distance between glu  <dig> oε1/oε <dig> and glu  <dig> oε1/oε <dig> is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively, whereas the distance between glu  <dig> oε1/oε <dig> and glu  <dig> oε1/oε <dig> is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively. xyn11a-lc has the β-jelly roll structure typical of family  <dig> xylanases , which is also likened to the shape of a ‘right hand’  <cit> . the eight-residue loop  forms a ‘thumb’ that partly encloses the catalytic cleft. glu  <dig> is located at the edge of the ‘thumb’ . the sequence and structure of the eight-residue loop of  <dig> family  <dig> xylanases, which were optimally active in acidic, neutral, or alkaline ph range, were compared, as shown in table  <dig>  the triad of residues that forms the tip of the thumb  and gly  <dig> are conserved in family  <dig> xylanase. the position  <dig> residue was a lysine residue in those xylanases with higher optimal ph, the corresponding residue is a glutamate or asparte residue in xyn 11a-lc and some xylanases with lower optimal ph. in addition, the lysine residue in the eight-residue loop in higher alkaline xylanases was involved in the formation of a salt bridge . it would be speculated that the elimination of the negative charge, the introduction of the positive charge, or the salt-bridge in the position  <dig> might be involved in the alkaline adaptation of xylanase.fig.  <dig> locations and structural analysis of three key mutation sites. a mutation location in the crystal structure of xyn11a-lc . the side chains of the catalytic residues  and mutation  are shown in red and green, respectively. a ‘thumb’ formed by the eight-residue loop is shown in green. b location and mutation of e135v/r. e <dig>  v <dig> and r <dig> are shown in green, orange, and purple, respectively. salt bridges are represented in yellow by dashed lines

the mutation e135v with improved alkalophilicity might prove that the elimination of the negative charge at position  <dig> could contribute to the alkaline adaptation of xylanase. in order to validate the positive charge at position  <dig>  the ph activity profiles of the mutations e135h, e135k and e135r were compared with e135v. the result showed that the ph activity profiles of the mutations e135h and e135k were similar to that of the e135v mutation, but e135r had higher alkapholicity than e135v, its optimal ph was increased to  <dig>  . the structural analysis showed that a putative salt-bridge could be established between the introduced arg  <dig> and asp  <dig> because of a large guanidinium group of arginine, but it didn’t exist between lys/his  <dig> and asp  <dig> . the superior performance for arg  <dig> relative to lys  <dig> or his  <dig> suggests that the bidentate hydrogen bonding that is geometrically feasible for arg  <dig> has more importance than simply the presence of a positive charge at this site.

discussion
research on xylanase used in the paper industry has attracted increasing attention because it can reduce the cost, lower environmental pollution and improve the pulp quality. it requires the xylanase to be stable and active at high temperature and alkaline ph  <cit> . however, most of the xylanases are reported to be mesophilic or acidophilic enzymes. in this study, directed evolution of the enzyme was used by error-prone pcr. xyn11a-lc was successfully engineered to improve its alkaline adaptation for potential industrial application for the pulp bleaching process.

the mutations e135v, e135k, e135h, e135a, e135q, e135m, and e135y all increased the optimal ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> . furthermore, e135r increased the optimal ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . however, the optimal ph of e135p was  <dig> ,  <dig>  ph units lower than that of the wild-type. it is speculated that a proline at position  <dig> is incompatible with the phi/psi for this beta turn, or it is likely to cause disruption through steric incompatibility with neighboring residues. other studies also proved that the substitution of the residue in other xylanases corresponding to glu  <dig> in xylanase xyn11a-lc could also change the ph activity profile of enzymes. the e141a mutation in xyl1p from scytalidium acidophilum increased the optimal ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the e141q mutation in xyni from aureobasidium pullulans changed the optimal ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . the mutation e139k of xyl <dig> of streptomyces sp. s <dig> significantly raised the ph optimum from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . therefore, the position  <dig> site may play an important role in determining the ph activity profile of family  <dig> xylanase.

the residue glu  <dig> located at the edge of the ‘thumb’ could also influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme. two mutations  of xylanase xyn11a-lc increased the catalytic activities to a different extent. the mutations e118a and e118q of xylanase from aspergillus niger for the same key position increased the activity by  <dig> and 16 %, respectively  <cit> . the same result was shown in xyl1p from s. acidophilum where e141a mutation elevated the specific activity by 50 %  <cit> . furthermore, the importance of this residue in the catalytic activity of family  <dig> xylanases was confirmed by the inverse mutation, the mutation a139e in xyl <dig> of streptomyces sp. s <dig> decreased its specific activity by 75 %  <cit> .

it was reported that the residues in the eight-residue loop were important in determining the ph optima of family  <dig> xylanase  <cit> . the residue glu  <dig> was located at the edge of the eight-residue loop on the protein surface . the substitution of glu  <dig> residue with the valine residue might improve the alkalophilicity of the enzyme by eliminating the negative charge on the surface. the mutation e135r might further improve the alkalophilicity by introduction of arginines residues and a salt-bridge on the surface. the ph-dependent activity of the enzyme depends on the ionization of catalytic acid residues sensitive to the surface charge of the protein. changing the surface charge of the enzyme could significantly shift the ph-activity profiles of the enzymes by changing the pk
a value of the active site, despite the two groups are far away from each other  <cit> . in our previous work, an increase in the number of the positive charge residues  and a decrease in the glu residue on the protein surface were involved in the mechanism of alkaline adaptation of the family  <dig> xylanases, because the basic residues have high pka values and can retain net positive charge even at high ph  <cit> . several studies showed that increasing the number of arginines on the protein surface could improve the alkalophilicity of enzymes  <cit> . in addition, there was a positive correlation between the number of salt bridges and alkaline adaptation of family  <dig> xylanases  <cit> . other studies also indicated that the characteristic salt bridges in the catalytic cleft could contribute to the alkalophilicity of an alkaline xylanase xynj from aklaliphilic bacillus sp. 41m- <dig>  <cit> . the salt bridge in the eight-residue loop might be beneficial to the stability of the enzyme in the alkaline condition and thus improve the alkalophilicity of the enzyme.

research has indicated that the eight-residue loop possesses an opening and closing capability that modifies both the topology and the binding capacity of the active site, and the loop’s precise position determines the width of the catalytic cleft  <cit> . although, the residue glu <dig> is far from the active site, it is located at the edge of the substrate binding cleft. the displacement of glu  <dig> residue might eliminate the electrostatic repulsions between the cleft and the xylan which has a certain degree of negative charge because of glucuronic acid substituents  <cit> . this could increase the binding ability of the substrate and the cleft  <cit> . an intimate interaction with the substrate might protect the catalytic residues within the active site from the solvent and therefore allow the enzyme to function at a higher ph condition. it is also the possible cause of the decrease of the k
m values in the two mutations e135v and e135r. the position of the loop may be changed when a larger substrate binds in a slightly different conformation, which changes the distances between the catalytic residues and the substrate and thus affects the catalytic activity of the enzyme  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using directed evolution followed by site-directed mutagenesis, the residue at position  <dig> in xyn11a-lc was speculated to be one of the key amino acids responsible for the ph activity profile of the enzyme. furthermore, sequence alignment and structural analysis of family  <dig> xylanases with different optimum ph showed that the residue at position  <dig> located at the edge of the ‘thumb’ could affect the alkalophilicty by the elimination of the negative charge and the information of the salt-bridge. it will be useful to understand the alkaline adaptation of family  <dig> xylanases and engineer the enzyme to function at a higher ph condition. the mutant e135r is a promising and suitable candidate for paper pulp bio-bleaching.
