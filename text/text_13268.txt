BACKGROUND
bacillus licheniformis is a gram positive, thermophilic spore forming soil bacterium closely related to b. subtilis. it is widely used in the fermentation industry for production of enzymes, antibiotics and other chemicals and is generally regarded as a non-pathogen
 <cit> . however, there are several reports of b. licheniformis- associated human infections such as bacteremia and enocarditis, bovine abortions and food borne diseases which raise the question of its pathogenic potential
 <cit> . more commonly, representatives of this species have caused spoilage of milk, bread and canned foods leading to severe economic losses to the food industry
 <cit> .

b. licheniformis is ubiquitous in the environment and able to grow under a wide range of temperatures  in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions making this species a highly potent food contaminant
 <cit> . during starvation, the cells may form thermo-stabile endospores in a process known as sporulation
 <cit> . these spores are resistant against many decontamination and preservation steps applied by the food industry such as pasteurization, pressure, freezing, extreme ph, radiation and desiccation
 <cit> . in the presence of nutrients  spores may germinate and grow out into vegetative cells which can multiply in the absence of competing microflora
 <cit> . germination can be further accelerated by external stress such as a short, sublethal heat step 
 <cit> . this phenomenon, known as “activation”, is utilized in the “double heat treatment” , a decontamination strategy where spores that are activated in the primary heat step can be inactivated or killed as germs in the secondary heat treatment
 <cit> . recent publications have provided new insight into the complexity of spore germination
 <cit> . the observed diversity in germination between and within populations makes spore behavior prediction challenging
 <cit>  and might explain why spore decontamination strategies sometimes fail. detecting strains with increased potential of causing food spoilage would therefore be of great value to the food industry.

several molecular typing methods have been applied in order to characterize the population structure within b. licheniformis <cit> . multi-locus sequence typing  has the advantage to other molecular typing methods of being unambiguous and easily portable between laboratories
 <cit> . it has been applied to numerous species including members of the b. cereus family and clostridium spp.
 <cit>  and has been used for epidemiological purposes identifying strains that could cause human infections
 <cit> . basically, it relies on the sequence of several  conserved house-keeping genes which are independently distributed in the genome. the method is therefore considered to be robust, discriminatory and capable of revealing the deeper evolutionary relation of populations that are studied
 <cit> . no mlst scheme has so far been developed for b. licheniformis.

the purpose of this study was to establish a mlst scheme for b. licheniformis in order to reveal the evolutionary relationship of  <dig> strains of this species and to see whether food-contaminating strains were restricted to certain lineages.

methods
mlst analysis of b. licheniformis
strains
 <dig> strains of b. licheniformis were included in this study. the strains represent various sources, including food, environmental and clinical strains  and were obtained from nvh , ccug  and lmg . the “f” strains were a kind gift from m. anderson and m. salkinoja-salonen .

bacterial growth and biochemical identification
all strains were stored at −70°c, plated on sheep blood agar  and grown at 30°c overnight. biochemical characterization was performed on pure cultures by using api  <dig> ch cassettes  according to the instructions given by the manufacturer
 <cit> . color changes were examined after  <dig> and 48 h at 30°c and compared to the bacillus identification profile database, api lab <dig> . the reaction profiles of these tests were compared with the apiwebtm database provided by the manufacturer.

dna extraction
bacteria were grown on sheep blood agar at 30°c overnight. single colony material was inoculated in 20 ml luria broth . the bacterial culture was grown overnight at 30°c and centrifuged at  <dig> × g for 10 min. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml enzymatic lysis buffer . further dna extraction was performed according to the protocol provided by dneasy blood and tissue kit . the final dna concentration ranged from 8–72 ng/ul with a mean 260/ <dig> absorbance ratio of  <dig>   <dig> .

mlst scheme
primer design
the mlst scheme was created according to general guidelines described in
 <cit> . primers were designed to amplify internal fragments of candidate-genes of the publicly available b. licheniformis atcc <dig> genome  using the primer <dig> software
 <cit> . the choice of candidate-genes was based previously published genotyping schemes for members of the bacillus genus
 <cit> . the primers targeted 400-718 bp fragments of the nine house-keeping genes adk, ccpa, glpt, gyrb, pyre, recf, rpob, succ and spo0a which were dispersed over the entire genome. the primers targeting rpob have been described in a previous publication and was included for comparison
 <cit> . all primers were synthesized by invitrogen life sciences, norway. primers and their targets are listed in table 
 <dig> primers that were used in the final mlst scheme are typed in bold.

real-time pcr and sequencing
the nine primer sets were applied on a subset of  <dig> strains to see which combination of loci that gave the highest level of discrimination and still being congruent . the amplification reactions were performed in 20 μl using 2 μl dna extract  as a template. real-time pcr reactions were performed in a lightcycler®  <dig> system using lightcycler®  <dig> sybr green i master  according to recommendations given by the manufacturer of the kit. the temperature program was as follows: 5 min initial denaturation at 95°c followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 10 s, annealing at 56°c for 10 s and primer extension at 72°c for 30 s. the amplifications were terminated after a final elongation step of 7 min at 72°c. the pcr fragments were verified by electrophoresis using bioanalyzer . pcr products were purified and sequenced by eurofins mwg operon  using the dideoxy chain termination method on a abi 3730xl sequencing instrument .

data analysis
the staden package
 <cit>  was used for alignment, editation and construction of consensus sequences based on the abi sequence chromatograms. consensus sequences were entered into the mega4
 <cit>  software and aligned by clustalw
 <cit> . sequences were trimmed to be in frame and encode an exact number of amino acids. dendograms for each locus  were constructed in mega <dig> using the neighbor-joining method  with branch lengths estimated by the maximum composite likelihood method
 <cit> . branch quality was assessed by the bootstrap test using  <dig> replicates. a subset of six loci including adk, ccpa, recf, succ, rpob and spo0a, which gave the highest tree resolution and still being congruent , was selected for the final mlst scheme . the trimmed sequences were entered into bionumerics software v.  <dig> ,  as fasta files and used to generate allelic profiles for each isolate based on the six loci. each unique allelic profile defined a sequence type . a cluster analysis was performed using the allelic profiles as categorical coefficients and a dendogram was constructed based on the upgma method. the tree branch quality was estimated by calculating the cophenetic correlation coefficients. sequence analysis was performed using the start <dig> software package
 <cit>  where the number of nucleotide differences and ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  were calculated. mega <dig> was used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the concatenated sequences  by the nj-method with branch lengths estimated by the maximum composite likelihood method
 <cit> . minimum spanning tree  was generated in bionumerics v. <dig>   using the categorical coefficient.

index of associaton 
to test the null hypothesis of linkage equilibrium  between the alleles of the six mslt loci, ia values were calculated in start <dig> by the classical  and the standardized  method
 <cit> . the test was repeated on a dataset containing only one isolate per st in order to avoid the risk of a bias toward a clonal population for strains with the same epidemiological history 
 <cit> .

RESULTS
mlst analysis
the percentage of variable sites at each locus ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>    which is low compared to data obtained for the b. cereus group  but comparable to mlst data for clostridium septicum <cit> . to our knowledge there are no similar data available for other species within the b. subtilis group which makes relevant comparison difficult. the discriminatory ability of the different loci, measured as number of alleles, varied from four  to eleven  . despite having the lowest allele number, adk represented the least conserved locus, containing the highest frequency of variable sites and also had the highest dn/ds nonsynonymous  to synonymous  substitution ratio. in contrast, all of the  <dig> substitutions in recf and  <dig> substitutions in rpob were synonymous still providing five different alleles . however, the dn/ds ratios of all six loci were close to zero, and quite low compared to other studies, indicating that they are all under stabilizing selection
 <cit> . among the  <dig> b. licheniformis strains included in this study  <dig> different sequence types  were identified .  <dig> sts were represented by only one strain. these strains clustered into two main groups, designated a and b . the strict group division was also consistent within every single locus, as observed by the neighbor-joining  cluster analysis for each individual locus . our results corresponded well with previous findings of two different lineages within b. licheniformis <cit> . the majority of our strains  including the type strain atcc <dig> clustered into group b. these strains seemed to be more closely related to each other than the strains in group a. no relationship between the source of the isolate and the clustering pattern were found which is in accordance with a previous study based on a combination of different molecular methods, including gyra and rpob sequence analysis
 <cit> . food isolates were found in both groups . apart from nvh <dig>   and nvh <dig>   we have sparse information about their survival in heat treated foods. interestingly, nvh <dig> was the only strain that did not fall into any of the two main groups in the allel-based mlst tree and could easily be distinguished from the other. nvh <dig>  and to a lesser extent nvh <dig>  were originally isolated from a semi-preserved meat product. these particular strains managed to survive a spore-reducing heat treatment regime 
 <cit>  which had been applied for several years until it failed . a huge number of cans with meat product were contaminated in pure culture with nvh <dig>  we do not know, for sure, why these specific strains managed to survive the double heat treatment. possible explanations could be; inappropriate spore activation, suboptimal levels of germinants or too short time interval between the two heat treatments to allow sufficient germination  and successive inactivation by the secondary heat step
 <cit> . it would be of interest to investigate if there are other strains  in our collection capable of surviving a similar heat regime and whether this feature is linked to certain genotypes. this would be of valuable information to the food industry.

the clustering of the various b. licheniformis strains is visualized in the minimum spanning tree  in figure 
 <dig>  the standardized index of association  was significantly different from zero  indicating a clonal population structure . these data are consistent with results obtained by mlst analysis of the b. cereus group
 <cit> . similar results were obtained when calculating ia on a dataset containing only one representative of each st, showing that potential sampling bias did not affect the outcome of the analysis
 <cit> . separate calculations for members of group a and b were performed to study any difference within the two subpopulations. significant linkage disequilibrium was detected in group a , whereas this was not the case in group b where isa was closer to zero . these results indicate that members of group b are subject to a higher rate of recombination than group a. we could hypothesise that the clonal structure of subgroup a was due to lack of natural genetic competence as described for dsm <dig> 
 <cit> . surprisingly, the genetically competent strain nvh1082/9945a
 <cit>  had identical st  to the non-competent type strain atcc <dig>  a fact that undermines our hypothesis.

in cases were recombination is rare it is generally recommended to concatenate the sequences before calculating dendograms
 <cit> . this concatenated dendogram corresponded well with the allel-based dendogram and is presented in additional file
 <dig>  a small difference between the allel-based and the concatenated dendogram was observed. nvh <dig>  was positioned slightly closer to group a isolates in the latter. when examining individual loci, nvh <dig>  clustered together with group a for all loci apart from adk. it is therefore reasonable to assume that nvh <dig>  could be regarded as a group a member. however, none of the mlst allels of nvh <dig> was shared by any other strains in our collection  underpinning the genetic distinction of nvh <dig>  from the other strains.

CONCLUSIONS
a robust and portable typing scheme for b. licheniformis was established. this method, based on six house-keeping genes separated the species into two distinct lineages. these two lineages seem to have evolved differently. the food spoilage strain nvh <dig> was distantly related to all other strains evaluated. the mlst scheme developed in the present study could be used for further studying of evolution and population genetics of b. licheniformis.
