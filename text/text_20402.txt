BACKGROUND
the olfactory recognition system plays a vital role in insect survival and reproduction owing to its roles of a number of essential processes, such as feeding, orientation, searching for hosts, mating, and oviposition. studies of the molecular mechanisms of the olfactory system have provided new prospects for integrated pest management. the seabuckthorn carpenterworm eogystia hippophaecolus   damages the seabuckthorn hippophae rhamnoides l. , which is widely distributed throughout northern and western china and prevents soil erosion and desertification  <cit> . zhou reported that outbreaks of e. hippophaecolus can lead to greater than 70 % seabuckthorn mortality in plantations in the inner mongolia autonomous region  <cit> . in addition to damaging seabuckthorn, it has destroyed ulmus pumila l.  as well as two or three species in the family rosaceae  <cit> . in  <dig>   <dig>  ha of seabuckthorn plantations were infested with the seabuckthorn carpenterworm  <cit> , which is considered a major threat to seabuckthorn plantations in china  <cit> .

a highly effective method to control the damaging larvae has not been developed owing to its complex ecological and life history traits; for example, the larvae bore into trunks and roots, complete one generation every 3– <dig> years, and exhibit  <dig> larval stages. by extracting female sex pheromone glands, identifying extracts, electroantennographic  analyses, and field trials, the sex pheromones of e. hippophaecolus female sex pheromone gland have been identified as -7-tetradecenyl acetate  and -3-tetradecenyl acetate   <cit> , and have been used to develop specific and efficient artificial sex pheromone traps  <cit> . based on plant volatile identification and a y-tube bioassay using seabuckthorn plants, -3-hexen-1-ol acetate is an effective compound for the detection of host location  <cit> ; however, its application has not been examined in field trials. the sensilla of female e. hippophaecolus can be classified into seven subtypes on the antennae, i.e., chaetica, trichodea , basiconica , coeloconica, and böhm’s bristles. in addition, chaetica, trichodea, and basiconic sensilla have been detected on the ovipositor  <cit> . some studies have evaluated the molecular biological properties of e. hippophaecolus. for example, the hh-dh-pban gene expression profile may be correlated with larval development and sex pheromone biosynthesis in female e. hippophaecolus  <cit> ; by using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, found the genetic structure of e. hippophaecolus be influenced by various confounding bio-geographical factors  <cit> .

the olfactory recognition process includes perireceptor and receptor events. perireceptor events of the chemosensory system involve odorant-binding proteins  and chemosensory proteins , and these are located in the lymph of sensilla at a high concentration. binding proteins function by binding hydrophobic odorants  at the pores of sensilla and transporting them through the sensilla lymph to facilitate solubilization . obps are soluble proteins characterized by a conserved pattern of six cysteines that form three disulfide bridges  <cit> . one specific and important subfamily of obps is the group of pheromone binding proteins   <cit> , which bind to pheromone compounds and participate in the pheromone recognition process. many studies have shown that the expression profiles of most obps are antenna-biased, especially those of pbps of sesamia nonagrioides and helicoverpa assulta  <cit> ; however, obp expression is not restricted to olfactory tissues, and they may participate in other physiological processes  <cit> . csps have fewer cysteines  and are smaller than obps  <cit> ; they bind to various odors . interestingly, csps are expressed in almost all chemosensory organs and non-olfactory organs, indicating that their functions in odor transport are not restricted  <cit> . in addition, an analysis of nine arthropoda genomes supported the birth-and-death model of obp and csp evolution  <cit> .

receptor events involve three receptor types, odorant receptors , ionotropic receptors , and gustatory receptors . these receptors are membrane proteins located in the outer dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons. most food odorants are detected by members of the or family  <cit> . irs mediate olfactory responses to a variety of odors, including acids, aldehydes, and perhaps humidity  <cit> . grs detect sugars, salts, amino acids, nucleotides, acidic ph conditions, a large variety of bitter compounds that activate bitter receptors, and co <dig>  <cit> . in addition, functional studies have suggested that ors and grs act as ligand-gated ion channels in the detection of environmental chemicals and pheromones, and emerging data implicates particular family members in thermosensation and photoreception as well as in non-sensory roles  <cit> . based on a phylogenetic analysis of nine species of lepidoptera, there are several highly conserved clades of olfactory receptors, representing ancestral paralogous lineages with functional divergence in some lineages  <cit> .

ors involved in odorant reception and signal transduction or those that bind to volatile chemicals  <cit>  have been studied most extensively, especially in bombyx mori and drosophila melanogaster. the heptahelical domain in ors is thought to function as a ligand-gated ion channel and/or to act metabotropically as a g protein-coupled receptor   <cit> . gpcrs contain seven putative transmembrane helices  <cit> , prompting a long-standing supposition that ors act metabotropically . insect ors dimerize with a highly conserved and universal co-receptor, orco , to form odorant-gated ion channels . or <dig> and or <dig> of bombyx mori have been examined in xenopus laevis oocytes using the voltage-clamp technique  <cit> . based on observed patterns of covariation in or amino acid sequences in various species, functionally important residues are located in highly constrained or regions and or models exhibit a transmembrane domain packing arrangement that differs from that of canonical gpcrs  <cit> . regarding the mechanisms underlying the high specificity of ors, insect chemosensory systems are hybrids between evolved combinatorial coding and conserved dedicated circuits. the relative contribution of these two modes depends on perceived chemical space and or repertoire size in different species. combinatorial coding may be the dominant strategy in insects that are able to discriminate between many odorants and odor objects, or it may increase the perceptible odor space in species with small or repertoires  <cit> . with respect to combinatorial coding, ors exhibit both broad molecular receptivity and narrow olfactory tuning  <cit> ; odorant intensity is determined by paralogous or pairs, such as 42a and 42b of d. melanogaster, which detect low and high amounts of the same odorant ligand  <cit> . in addition, n,n-diethyl-meta-toluamide  acts as a molecular “confusant” that scrambles the insect odor code; this effect provides a compelling explanation for the broad-spectrum efficacy of deet against multiple insect species  <cit> . in migratory locusts, rna interference and behavioral assays have indicated that an or-based signaling pathway, not an ir-based pathway, mediates the attraction of locusts to aggregation pheromones  <cit> .

irs are a conserved family of synaptic ligand-gated ion channels that evolved from ionotropic glutamate receptors   <cit> , which are involved in both smell and taste in insects  <cit> . mutations in ir84a, ir64a, ir8a, and ir25a of drosophila inhibit odor-evoked neuronal responses  <cit> . however, the specificity of ligand recognition by irs is unclear  <cit> . some members of the ir superfamily are expressed in taste neurons. intriguingly, drosophila ir94b has been implicated in auditory system functions  <cit> .

grs have been studied most extensively in d. melanogaster, which can detect sugars, salts, amino acids, acidic ph conditions, bitter molecules, co <dig>  and nucleotides in taste receptors  <cit> . dmelgr5a  <cit> , dmelgr64a  <cit> , and dmelgr64f  <cit>  are involved in broad responses to sugars. dmelgr43a  <cit>  is a specific fructose receptor. dmelgr33a  <cit>  detects a wide range of bitter chemicals. dmelgr21a and dmelgr63a  <cit>  detect co <dig>  in addition to specific tastes, grs involved in the detection of glycerol, fatty acids, and hydrogen peroxide have also been identified in d. melanogaster .

in this study, we examined the antennal transcriptome of e. hippophaecolus, verified the accuracy of the transcriptome data, determined the expression profiles of obps, and evaluated the phylogenetic relationships between e. hippophaecolus obps and those of other species. we identified olfactory proteins that are the basis for the olfactory system. these data may help reveal olfactory receptive mechanisms and provide a theoretical basis for new pest control methods that impede the main olfactory recognition processes.

we identified transcripts encoding  <dig> putative ors. among them, we detected  <dig> that likely represented full-length genes, encoding proteins of longer than  <dig> amino acids with complete orfs. we detected multiple e. hippophaecolus ors that were best matches with the same species and sequence . for example, the best match for ehipor <dig> and ehipor <dig> was b. mori np_ <dig> , ehipor <dig> and ehipor <dig> exhibited best matches with b. mori np_ <dig> , ehipor <dig> and ehipor <dig> matched danaus plexippus ehj <dig> , and ehipor <dig> and ehipor <dig> exhibited best matches with helicoverpa armigera aig <dig> . ehippr <dig>  ehipor <dig>  ehiporco and ehipor <dig> were first four highest ors expressed in antenna  due to fpkm . in the phylogenetic tree , the orco lineage  with  <dig>  bootstrap support value included ehiporco, dmelorco and orcos of other lepidoptera species. besides, the pheromone receptor lineage  with  <dig>  bootstrap support value contained all pheromone receptor  of lepidoptera species, except pxylpr, in which ehippr <dig>  ehippr <dig>  and ehippr3were included . besides, all of the ors of e. hippophaecolus clustered with lepidopteran species in nine lepidoptera-specific lineages, ehiporco, ehipor <dig>  ehipor <dig>  ehipor <dig>  ehipor <dig>  ehipor <dig> and ehipor <dig> were excepted.fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of odorant receptors . the nj phylogenetic analysis of ors of e. hippophaecolus  was performed with reference ors of d. melanogaster  and ors of lepidoptera species . the red circles refer to orco and pr lineage. the stability of the nodes was assessed by bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replications, and only bootstrap values ≥ <dig>  are shown at the corresponding nodes. the scale bar represents  <dig>  substitutions per site



ionotropic receptors
twelve irs, but not ehipir68a which was most similar to adr <dig>  of spodoptera littoralis, were best matches with ostrinia furnacalis. among them, we detected eight that were likely to be full-length genes with complete bigger than 100 bp orfs. ehipir76b was the highest irs expressed in antenna according to the fpkm of female and male . in the phylogenetic tree , most irs were clustered as known group. for example, the ir41a group contained ehipir41a, dpleir41a, hmelir41a and bmorir41a. ehipir21a, ehipir <dig>  ehipir8a, ehipir25a, ehipir76band ehipir31a were in ir21a group, ir <dig> group, ir8a group, ir25a group, ir76b group and ir31a group which labelled with red circle respectively. the red circle labelled biggest group, ir <dig>  were constructed by ehipir75p <dig>  ehipir75p <dig>  ehipir75p <dig>  ehipir75q2b, ehipir75q2a, dmelir75d and irs of other lepidoptera species. all identified irs of e. hippophaecolus were divided into eight irs group. besides, other known irs group, ir <dig>  ir93a, ir40a, ir7d, and ir87a were also clustered in the tree.fig.  <dig> neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of ionotropic receptors . the nj phylogenetic analysis of irs of e. hippophaecolus  was performed with reference irs of h.armigera , d. melanogaster  and irs of other lepidoptera species . the irs groups labelled with red circle were reference of van schooten  <cit> . the stability of the nodes was assessed by bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replications, and only bootstrap values ≥ <dig>  are shown at the corresponding nodes. the scale bar represents  <dig>  substitutions per site

fluorescence quantitative real-time pcr
we verified obp expression in antennae and characterized the expression profiles of nine obps in four chemosensory tissues of male . for seven of the nine obps, we observed the highest expression levels in antennae . moreover, we detected very significantly higher expression levels of obp <dig>  gobp <dig>  gobp <dig>  and obp <dig> in antennae than in all other organs , and we observed significantly antennal-biased expression for obp <dig> in all other organs . we observed the highest obp <dig> and obp <dig> expression in antennae, and these expression levels were significantly higher than those in the feet and external genitalia, but were not significantly different than those in the labial palps. in labial palps, we observed that obp <dig> and obp10were most highly expressed. only obp <dig> was most highly expressed in the foot, and obp <dig> expression in the foot was significantly higher than that in other organs. we detected external genital-biased expression of obp <dig>  noticeably, obp <dig> expression in external genitalia was extremely significantly higher than obp6expression in all other organs. in summary, we observed antennal-biased expression of most e. hippophaecolus obps, but a few loci exhibited biased expression in the foot and external genitalia, such as obp <dig> and obp <dig>  respectively. we did not observe any obps in e. hippophaecolus that exhibited biased expression in labial palps.fig.  <dig> odorant binding protein  transcript levels of e. hippophaecolus in four tissues. a: antennae; f:foot; g: external genitals; l: labipalp. actin was used as the reference gene to normalize target gene expression. the standard errors are represented by the error bars, different lowercase letters  above the bars denote significant differences at p <  <dig> , and different capital letters  above the bars denote significant differences at p <  <dig> 



discussion
many olfactory proteins in lepidoptera defoliators have prophylactic and treatment applications. however, the olfactory proteins in lepidopteran borer species, especially those belonging to cossidae, have not been studied to date. to better understand the vital role of olfactory proteins in borer moths, we investigated chemosensory proteins in the antennal transcriptome of e. hippophaecolus and characterized the expression profiles of these loci by fluorescence quantitative real-time pcr. our results provide direct molecular evidence for a role of olfactory proteins in chemosensory reception, establish a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of olfactory recognition, and have applications to borer integrated pest management.

obps are considered the first gate in the odorant recognition process, especially for hydrophobic odors; they bind and transport odors, including pheromones and plant volatiles, across the lymph in the sensillum  <cit> . we identified  <dig> putative obps, of which we studied the expression of nine in antennae and other chemosensory tissues. remarkably, most obps exhibited biased expression in antennae, suggesting a vital role of obps in antennal recognition processes. these results were consistent with previous observations in helicoverpa assulta  <cit> , chilo suppressalis  <cit> , loxostege sticticalis  <cit> , sesamia inferens  <cit> , and agrotis ipsilon  <cit> . and found except ehipobp <dig> and ehipobp <dig>  other four antenna-biased expressed obps were with obviously high fpkm consistently, which further supported the antenna-biased expression characteristic of obps. some obps exhibited biased expression in non-antennal chemosensory tissues; we observed biased ehipobp <dig> expression in the foot, and this may be related to the identification of host plant volatiles. we also observed extremely biased ehipobp <dig> expression in male external genitalia, providing direct molecular evidence that the locus is responsible for pheromone binding and involved in mate recognition. we did not detect e. hippophaecolus obps that exhibited biased expression in labial palps; considering the function of labial palps, we speculated that gustatory molecular binding proteins and contact sensillum-biased chemosensory proteins are highly expressed in labial palps. the expression profiles of other obps in lepidoptera species have been investigated at various stages, in both sexes, and in chemosensory and non-chemosensory tissues  <cit> . csps are regarded as a subfamily of obps. obps and csps exhibited different expression profiles; obp expression was antennal-biased, but csps have no obvious expression bias  <cit> . the expression of csps in anoplophora glabripennis is not antennal-biased, but is high in other chemosensory tissues, such as the maxillary palps and propodeum  <cit> . in brief, these results indicated that obps mainly participate in antennal olfactory recognition, but csps are involved in olfactory recognition in many chemosensory organs. in the dendrogram of obps, the four pbp lineages and gobp lineage comprised the pbp/gobp complex, which support vogt’s result of the monophyletic of pbp/gobp and pbp with more dynamic evolution than gobp  <cit> . besides,  <dig> candidate chemosensory proteins were identified. based on the phylogenetic analysis, almost all csps of diptera formed a taxon-specific clade, which diversification according to the divergence of insect orders has also been observed in mamestra brassicae  <cit> . the snmps are conserved throughout holometabolous insects  <cit> , however snmp <dig> and snmp <dig> did not cluster in a monophyletic group respectively, which indicated the differentiation of snmps among classification.

ors connect binding proteins with olfactory sensory neurons and conduct olfactory signal transduction. in female and male antennae, we detected  <dig> ors. in the neighbor-joining tree, we observed ehiporco in the orco lineage, which suggests that we found the e. hippophaecolus ocro. and three ehipprs were in the pheromone receptor lineage with high bootstrap support value, which indicates that ehippr <dig>  ehippr <dig> and ehippr <dig> are pheromone receptor of e. hippophaecolus. but the relationship between three pheromone receptors and three pheromone binding protein need to study further.

we identified  <dig> irs in the antennal transcriptome. according to the genome-wide analysis of ionotropic receptors in heliconius butterflies, the irs group was added and improved  <cit> . with reference of this study, we found seven ir groups in e. hippophaecolus, which were ehipir41a, ehipir21a, ehipir <dig>  ehipir8a, ehipir25a, ehipir76b, and ehipir31a. besides, ehipir75p <dig>  ehipir75p <dig>  ehipir75p <dig>  ehipir75q2b and ehipir75q2a were ir <dig> of e. hippophaecolus, which were new identified irs diversity group and consistent with corresponding functions. notably, transcripts putatively encoding ir8a and ir25a which are thought to function as ir co-receptors  <cit>  were also found in e. hippophaecolus.

we also detected  <dig> grs in the antennal transcriptome, which provides important sequence information. grs typically function in sensing sugar, co <dig> and bitter molecules  <cit> . in the phylogenetic tree, grs involved in the detection of sugar, co <dig> and bitter molecules clustered in a group. the sugar receptor lineages were included bmorgr <dig> and bmorgr <dig>  consistent with the functions of them  <cit>  and include harmgr <dig>  harmgr <dig>  harmgr <dig>  harmgr <dig>  harmgr <dig>  harmgr <dig> and harmgr <dig>  consistent with their functions  <cit> . ehipgr <dig> belonged to the sugar-sensing lineage, indicating that it is function in sugar detection. as for bitter sensing, with reference of genome analysis of gustatory receptor in h. armigera, the type  <dig> bitter grs with long intronless and clustered together in the phylogenetic tree  <cit>  was also clustered in tree and formed bitter lineage that contain ehipgr <dig> and ehipgr <dig>  known other more ehipgrs’ function should study and research systematically and deeply.

the fpkm of ors, grs and irs were much less than binding proteins  integrally, which indicated that most olfactory membrane proteins genes were low expressed in antenna. besides, result of two or more unigenes matched to the same gene was common in e. hippophaecolus transcriptome data and others. the reason may as follows. firstly was due to the insufficient elaborate gene diversity and gene type in nr database. second, this unigens contiained fragments of a same gene, which couldn't be properly assembled. third, this unigens were paralogs with the same gene.

CONCLUSIONS
we reported the e. hippophaecolus antennal transcriptome, which is the first analysis of olfactory proteins in a cossidae species. we identified  <dig> olfactory genes that provide a foundation for studies of the olfactory recognition process and the olfactory system. for instance, the pbp/gobp complex supported the monophyletic between them orco and three pheromone receptors were found in e. hippophaecolus; ehipgr <dig> detects sugar, and ehipgr <dig> and ehipgr <dig> detect bitter. additionally, we verified the expression of nine obps in antennae and confirmed the accuracy of the antennal transcriptome data. and we observed antennal-biased expression for nearly all nine obps, and observed extremely antennal-biased expression of obp <dig>  obp <dig>  obp <dig>  gobp <dig>  and gobp <dig> demonstrating that obps primarily function in the antennal recognition process. moreover, a few obps exhibited biased expression in other chemosensory tissues and may a component of olfactory binding that target pheromones and volatiles in external genitals and feet.
