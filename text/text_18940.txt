BACKGROUND
cultivated rice  is considered a model for species within the poaceae family and, in particular, for agronomically important cereals such as maize , wheat , and barley . recently, map-based sequencing of a japonica subspecies of rice has been completed with the final sequence representing ~95% of the estimated  <dig> mb genome  <cit> . in addition to having a nearly complete genomic sequence, rice has  <dig>  full-length cdna  sequences as well as a collection of > <dig>  million publicly available expressed sequence tags  and cdnas  <cit> . the rice genome assembly, based upon the tigr annotation effort  <cit> , contains  <dig> pseudomolecules totaling ~ <dig> mb of sequence and  <dig>  genes -related).

in this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing in rice, a model monocotyledonous species, using the latest set of rice transcript data and the program to assemble spliced alignments . the pasa software  <cit>  assembles and clusters spliced transcript alignments, providing transcript-based gene structures that are used to automatically improve existing gene annotations by adding untranslated regions , adjusting intron and exon boundaries, and adding new models that represent alternative splicing, among its numerous other functions. alignment assembly, as performed via pasa, is particularly well-suited to the study of alternative splicing. pasa assembles overlapping and compatible alignments into maximal alignment assemblies; compatible alignments are defined as overlapping alignments that are transcribed on the same strand and have identical introns in their regions of overlap. if all overlapping transcripts yield consistent gene structures, they are assembled into a single alignment assembly, and by doing so, pasa acts to simply consolidate the transcript alignments into a single gene structure. however, overlapping transcript alignments that have different introns in their region of overlap, due to a splicing variation, are found incompatible and cannot be assembled together, and hence occupy distinct maximal alignment assemblies. after assembling all overlapping alignments, those distinct pasa assemblies found overlapping at the same locus and transcribed in the same orientation yield representative splicing isoforms for that locus.

many algorithms have been introduced to reconstruct gene structures from spliced alignments of transcripts to genome sequences  <cit> . these most often decompose the alignments into introns and exons, build a splicing graph data structure  <cit>  and traverse the graph to find combinations of introns and exons that are best supported by the underlying data under some scoring scheme. an inherent danger of splicing graphs is that they have the potential to report combinations of introns and exons for which there is no evidence in existing transcript alignments. alternative strategies to reconstruct isoforms assemble individual whole alignments instead of their component introns and exons, and by doing so, retain distal correlations between non-adjacent exons found within single transcript alignments  <cit> . isoform reconstruction  as performed by pasa is strictly an exercise in dynamic programming to chain  together a compatible series of whole transcript alignments such that each alignment is found within a maximal chain of compatible alignments  <cit> . this generates an isoform structure supported by the largest number of compatible whole est and whole cdna alignments.

our comprehensive analysis confirms that alternative splicing is a widespread phenomenon, and also confirms prior research into alternative splicing in both rice and arabidopsis  <cit>  the most recent analysis for these species identified  <dig>  alternative splicing events affecting  <dig>  rice genes and  <dig>  alternative splicing events affecting  <dig>  arabidopsis genes  <cit> . our analysis incorporates new data to extend these numbers to  <dig>  events affecting  <dig>  rice genes and  <dig>  events affecting  <dig>  arabidopsis genes. we also note some parallels with alternative splicing in mammalian species. for example, alternate acceptor  splice sites for these two plant species are most often separated by only three base pairs ; a feature observed in mammalian species  <cit> . however, when looking at the aa class overall for rice and arabidopsis, the majority of these events are predicted to result in a downstream frameshift in translation, consistent with research in mouse  <cit> . alternate donor  splice sites are most often found to be separated by only four bp in both species, and this maximal occurrence was previously observed in mouse with the majority of the ad isoforms yielding a frameshift  <cit> . the retained intron  class of alternative splicing is prevalent in both rice and arabidopsis and often introduces a premature stop codon in the intron. these three classes  represent the majority of the alternative splicing events in both rice and arabidopsis with the occurrence of the remaining classes being far less frequent. further, the frequent introduction of either a frameshift or premature stop codon by the three predominant classes of splicing events suggests that post-transcriptional regulation via nonsense mediated decay  may play a more important role than augmenting the proteome.

RESULTS
pasa-generated transcript alignment assemblies for rice and arabidopsis
all ests and mrna ) sequences were obtained from public databases  <cit> . these data, current as of february  <dig>   <dig> include  <dig> , <dig> rice ests,  <dig>  rice mrnas,  <dig>  arabidopsis ests, and  <dig>  arabidopsis mrna sequences. the number of rice ests is nearly double that of arabidopsis due to  <dig>  rice ests that were deposited in ddbj by the riken-based full-length cdna consortium. additionally, the riken effort has generated > <dig>  rice fl-cdnas that are publicly available  <cit> . while arabidopsis has fewer total ests , it has nearly double the number of fl-cdnas. approximately 96–98% of all transcripts were found to match their respective genomes using the gmap transcript alignment software  <cit> .

we limited our analysis of alternative splicing to only those transcript alignments that have a nearly perfect alignment to the genome . our overall averages for length and identity exceeded 99% . additionally, all exon boundaries required canonical splice sites   <cit> . finally, since we are focusing on alternatively spliced transcripts, it is essential that we have high confidence in the mapping of the exon-intron boundaries. we have found that spliced alignment programs will sometimes introduce gaps and mismatches within the exon sequence adjacent to the splice site in order to include a consensus splice site in the resulting alignment. we required that each alignment segment have at least three exact bp matches directly adjoining the consensus donor and acceptor splice site in order to exclude this potential artifact. approximately 90–92% of rice and arabidopsis transcript alignments met all of these strict validation criteria. one potential source of invalidation here would be due to the use of transcribed sequences from non-japonica cultivars of rice or non-columbia ecotypes for arabidopsis.

using pasa, we assembled the  <dig>  spliced rice transcript alignments into  <dig>  alignment assemblies,  <dig>  of which contain fl-cdnas . we also assembled  <dig>  spliced arabidopsis transcript alignments into  <dig>  alignment assemblies, of which  <dig>  include fl-cdnas . for ests that met all other mapping criteria but lack evidence for being spliced , we excluded these transcripts from being assembled. this invalidation step will minimize the spurious inclusion of incompletely processed transcripts in the retained intron class. the alignment assemblies, each of which corresponds to at least one distinct mrna isoform, served as the substrate for this current and comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing in higher plants.

distribution of pasa assemblies within isoform clusters
the alignment assemblies were clustered based on overlapping genome coordinates and transcribed orientations in order to group together those assemblies that correspond to the same genomic locus or gene. each cluster of pasa alignment assemblies can contain either single or multiple transcript alignment assemblies. a cluster comprising multiple assemblies indicates splicing variations mapped to the same genomic locus. a total of  <dig>  rice and  <dig>  arabidopsis clusters comprise only a single assembly , thereby lacking evidence of alternative splicing. however,  <dig>   rice clusters have more than one assembly and range from  <dig>  clusters having two assemblies to two clusters having  <dig> distinct assemblies . the results for arabidopsis are comparable to rice. the majority of clusters supporting alternative splicing contain just two assemblies;  <dig> % of the multiple assembly containing clusters for rice and  <dig> % in arabidopsis . the data from both species demonstrate that as the number of assemblies per cluster increases, the corresponding number of clusters decreases precipitously. while alternative splicing can produce a wide variety of isoforms, such as the  <dig>  possible forms for the drosophila dscam gene  <cit> , these data in rice and arabidopsis clearly indicate that alternative splicing produces only a limited number of isoforms in plants. given that pasa alignment assemblies in clusters of multiples are indicative of alternative splicing variations, and each assembly is representative of a given  splicing isoform of a gene, we henceforth use the term assembly and isoform interchangeably.

description of the alternative splicing isoforms observed in rice and arabidopsis
prior research has shown that the classes of splicing variations observed through comprehensive analyses in arabidopsis are similar to that observed in mammalian systems  <cit> . we have assigned labels to rice and arabidopsis splicing isoforms corresponding to the following nine classes of alternative splicing: a) alternate acceptor , b) alternate donor , c) alternate terminal exon , d) skipped exon , e) retained exon , f) initiation within an intron , g) termination within an intron , h) retained intron , and i) spliced intron . note that the re and se classes are reciprocal, i.e. an assembly of the se class is complemented by its cognate paired assembly displaying the re class. likewise, the si and ri classes are reciprocal. examples of each of the classes of alternative splicing are illustrated in figure  <dig> and described below.

the aa and ad classes involve isoforms with a shared intron, overlap among adjacent exons, but different splice sites chosen for either the donor or the acceptor sites.

the ate class is defined as having two completely distinct sets of terminal  exons that possess no overlapping exon sequence. the re class includes a distinct exon in one isoform that is spliced out of its corresponding isoform . the iwi and twi classes are conceptually similar where either the 5' or the 3' end of the transcript isoform occurs in an intron of its longer isoform. the final alternative splicing class, ri, is defined by the alternatively spliced isoform retaining an intron that is found spliced in the corresponding si isoform.

relative support for splicing variation
the support for alternative splicing derived from pasa-mediated assemblies can correspond to either a single transcript or multiple independent transcripts. the number of underlying individual transcript alignments exhibiting a specific splicing variation may reflect the in vivo prevalence of the variation as compared with the number of transcripts exhibiting a mutually exclusive variation. caution is needed when only a single transcript supports a variation, as this may reflect a cdna that was captured prior to the completed processing of the pre-mrna by the spliceosome, or a possible aberration in transcription  <cit> . ratios of the total number of underlying transcripts responsible for each mutually exclusive pair of splicing variations found via pairwise comparisons of isoforms were calculated, and this value allowed us to infer the major and minor isoforms. this ratio is termed the transcript ratio . the analysis presented here requires that each variation be supported by two or more transcripts.

unlike the symmetrical classifications of aa, ad and ate where each isoform variant is given the same label, the remaining variations  are labeled asymmetrically which allows us to examine the support for each mutually exclusive type and to deduce which are the major and minor variant. table  <dig> has three bins reflecting the transcript support for each of the remaining six classes of alternative splicing. the three bins of ratios are minor , equal/equivalent , or major . in both rice and arabidopsis, the se, twi, iwi and ri classes are generally the minor variants when compared to their counterparts. for example,  <dig> % of the rice skipped exons are the minor isoforms when compared to their cognate retained exon  isoform. while the iwi and twi splicing variations may be legitimate isoforms transcribed from alternate promoters or exhibiting alternate 3' termini, they may also result from aberrant transcription or processing or possibly obtained as cdna cloning artifacts. data for comparisons of assemblies with all  available transcripts are provided .

alternative splicing class distribution
for rice and arabidopsis, the prevalence of the nine alternative splicing classes is shown in table  <dig>  an event is defined here as the unique feature , etc) isolated from the assembly comparisons. overall,  <dig>  alterative splicing events were found in rice which translates into alternative splicing in  <dig>   rice alignment assemblies,  <dig>   of the clusters, and  <dig>   of the total tigr annotated rice genes  <cit> . a total of  <dig>   alternative splicing events were identified in arabidopsis within  <dig>   of the arabidopsis alignment assemblies,  <dig>   of the clusters, and  <dig>   of the total tigr annotated arabidopsis genes  <cit> . these data show a significant increase of alternative splicing in rice and arabidopsis from that reported by wang and brendel, whose dataset had a total of  <dig>  spliced and unspliced arabidopsis ests/cdnas and  <dig>  spliced and unspliced rice ests/cdnas  <cit> .

one caveat required when looking at the breakdown of alternative splicing by class in table  <dig> is that the sums of the nine splicing classes exceed the totals presented above. this disparity is due to the fact that a single cluster can contain multiple assemblies  and each assembly can contain several of the alternative splicing classes when compared to the other assemblies in the shared cluster. the four most frequently observed alternative splicing classes in both rice and arabidopsis are aa, si, ri, and ad, with the aa class being the most frequent. of the remaining five classes , the percentages for the assembly comparisons are higher in each case for rice than in arabidopsis but with a similar relative distribution.

when considering the abundance of splicing variations found on a cluster basis, the reciprocal ri/si and symmetrical aa classes occur most frequently in rice and arabidopsis. as observed in the alignment assembly statistics, the cluster percentages for each of the remaining classes are higher in rice than in arabidopsis. three analyses using est clustering in arabidopsis have shown that the ri class was most frequent among the classes of alternative splicing  <cit> . notably, both the prevalence of the twi and iwi classes are far greater in rice when compared to arabidopsis. earlier we noted that the twi and iwi classes are largely unsupported in comparison to their counterparts that lack these variations. their accumulation in the rice data may be due to the vast quantity of rice ests as compared with fl-cdnas. arabidopsis has nearly double the number of fl-cdnas in the assemblies and the subsequent clusters when compared to rice and these fl-cdna assemblies presumably provide a more complete representation of the gene, which may be reflected in the lower rates of twi and iwi in arabidopsis.

given that a cluster of assemblies can contain one or more of the alternative splicing isoforms, an interesting parallel in the distribution of alternative splicing in the clusters for the two species can be observed. in both rice and arabidopsis, the number of discrete alternative splicing classes in a single cluster can range from one to nine . these data show that as the complexity of the splicing isoforms increases in a cluster, the number of clusters decreases.

frameshifts are a frequent consequence of chosen alternate acceptor and alternate donor sites
prior work using a limited set of fl-cdna transcripts has shown the close proximity of alternative splicing sites in arabidopsis  <cit>  and this has also been noted in human and mouse  <cit> . the difference in base pairs  between either the alternatively spliced isoforms' donor or the acceptor site was calculated as "delta bp". these delta bp values were analyzed to determine whether the aa or ad splicing isoform would retain its translation frame by being a multiple of three  or result in a translational frameshift for those delta bp values that are not a multiple of three. for the  <dig>  assembly comparisons that were performed to identify the delta bps for the rice aa class,  <dig>   are predicted to retain their translational frame with the remaining  <dig>  aa having a translational frameshift downstream of the splice site. for the  <dig>  assembly comparisons in the arabidopsis aa class,  <dig>   retain their translational frame and the remaining  <dig>  will be frameshifted.

similar to the aa class, the majority of ad assemblies in both arabidopsis and rice are predicted to lead to a frameshift when translated. for the  <dig>  assembly comparison in rice,  <dig>   will lead to a frameshift, and for arabidopsis,  <dig>  of the total  <dig>   assembly comparison will lead to a frameshift in translation.

distribution of sequence lengths between alternate donors and acceptors
histograms were generated after binning all of the common delta bp values for the range between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp. the aa class had a maximal delta bp peak of  <dig> bp for both rice and arabidopsis  with a maximal occurrence of  <dig> alternate site pairs for rice and  <dig> for arabidopsis. this maximal peak of  <dig> bp in the aa class was recently noted in comparative studies of mouse and human alternatively spliced genes  <cit> . for the aa class, the full data set of delta bp for rice and arabidopsis is provided .

for rice, the ad class has a maximal occurrence over the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp bins with  <dig> and  <dig> examples, respectively for rice, and  <dig> and  <dig> examples for arabidopsis, respectively . the entire data set for the ad class is provided . this maximal peak in ad was noted in the recent work with human and mouse  <cit> .

nucleotide distribution flanking the 3' splice acceptor in rice
prior work on the acceptor site in the human genome generated the consensus acceptor sequence of nnag|g  <cit> . for the aa class with a delta bp value of three, the dna structure of nagnag is observed where either of the ag dinucleotides can be utilized as an acceptor  <cit> . for mammalian species, the most common dna sequence for this hexamer is cagcag  <cit> . to investigate whether this nagnag motif in mammalian species is also present in higher plants, we isolated  <dig> bp flanking the splice site for each of the delta bp values ranging from two to  <dig>  pictograms representing the base frequency at each position about the aa variation are displayed in figure  <dig> and confirm that the most frequent sequence is a tandem repeat of cagcag  <cit> . the rice consensus acceptor site nncag|n was generated using  <dig>  randomly chosen non-alternatively spliced acceptor splice sites and is shown at the top of figure  <dig>  interestingly, as the sequence length increases between the two ag acceptors from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, a clear pattern emerges where the intervening sequence between the acceptors has a consensus of caggngcag. this feature was observed in the drosophila sex-lethal gene where the pyrimidine tract was noted for the sequence between alternative acceptors of this gene having a delta bp of  <dig> bp  <cit> . two features germane to the sequences flanking the dinucleotide acceptor are that the intronic sequence upstream of the splice site has a consensus polypyrimidine tract and generally a pyrimidine before the acceptor ag dinucleotide  <cit> . the exonic  sequence of the second acceptor splice site has a random distribution of all four nucleotides, reflecting the nucleotide distribution in the mostly protein coding sequence   <cit> . these pictograms show that the distal  splice site has a consensus cag site for the acceptor but the distribution of the cytosine nucleotide is reduced in the proximal acceptor as the difference in sequence length between the two sites increases in length.

nucleotide distribution flanking the 5' splice donor in rice
the dna sequence that flanks the donor splice site in the ad class with a sequence length difference less than or equal to  <dig> bp was likewise displayed in pictograms . previously, a statistical analysis of the sequences flanking donor sites in human revealed a consensus 5' splice site of mag|gtragt with a strong requirement for a guanine nucleotide at positions - <dig> and + <dig>  <cit> . we defined the consensus donor sequence from rice using  <dig>  non-alternatively spliced donor sites as ag|gtawgn. notably, in all of the pictograms there is a strong preference for a guanine nucleotide adjacent and upstream of the gt donor dinucleotide in either splicing variant. in the intronic sequence downstream of the distal splice site, a polypyrimidine stretch of sequence is noted. unlike the aa class where a gng consensus sequence was observed, there appears to be no clear consensus in the intervening sequence between the two donor splice sites. however, two conserved features among these donor sites are noted: first, the proximal and distal nucleotides to the donor splice gt dinucleotide are enriched for a purine nucleotide, and second, the thymine base in the gt donor is substituted for a cytosine at an elevated rate.

elevated substitution of a gc donor for a gt donor in the ad class
the enrichment of gc donors in alternatively spliced genes has been observed previously in human and c. elegans  <cit> . we isolated all of the donor and acceptor dinucleotides in each splicing event for the ad and aa classes and separately isolated all the canonical donor dinucleotides involved directly in either the aa or ad splicing cases  <cit> . a chi-square analysis for the distribution of the ag and ac acceptor supports the null hypothesis that the ag  and ac  acceptor dinucleotides involved as alternative acceptor splice sites are not significantly different from their overall distribution. for the donors, the at dinucleotide distribution in alternative splicing is similar to that observed in the whole set  whereas the gc distribution was significantly elevated  and gc ).

localizing splicing variations to coding sequence or untranslated regions of fl-cdna-based gene structures
fl-cdnas have proven highly valuable to the improvement of structural annotation of gene models in arabidopsis  <cit> . likewise, the riken effort to generate a large set of rice fl-cdnas has greatly improved its structural annotation  <cit> . we have evaluated the nine classes of splicing events in clusters in which at least one alignment assembly incorporates a fl-cdna. these fl-cdna assemblies  are used to provide reference gene structures to which splicing variations found in other isoforms can be localized to the protein-coding region  or to untranslated regions  flanking the cds. a total of  <dig>  splicing variations were mapped to  <dig>  rice clusters containing at least one fl-cdna reference assembly. for arabidopsis,  <dig>  splicing variations were mapped to  <dig>  fl-cdna clusters containing at least one fl-cdna reference assemblies.

evaluating the impacts of splicing on protein structure
a more restrictive analysis was performed to identify the effects of splicing variations on the coding sequence of alternatively spliced genes based solely on fl-assemblies for both rice and arabidopsis. only those assemblies generating a complete orf of greater than  <dig> amino acids and having the same translational frame for a subset of the cds were retained for this analysis. in these cases, the fl-assembly encoding the longest orf was chosen as the reference to which alternate fl-assemblies were compared.

for rice,  <dig> reference gene structures based on fl-assemblies were compared to an additional  <dig> fl-assembly based gene structures for rice . for the aa and ad splicing events,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of these events, respectively, changed the frame of the protein, which supports our earlier inference that the majority of the aa and ad events could alter the frame if translated. for these two classes, the protein encoded by the alternative isoform was shortened to  <dig> %  or  <dig> %  of the longer isoform's protein length. in contrast, the ri class rarely changed the frame  of translation, largely because the ri class led to the incorporation of a termination codon in the sequence of the retained intron. by contrast, when the alternative isoform exhibited the spliced intron, this led to a frameshift in each case, suggesting that this spliced intron within the coding sequence had a significant consequence on the translated product. no effects on the frame of translation were observed when isoforms either initiated or terminated transcription in an intron and the data shown previously clearly shows that the vast majority of twi and iwi class isoforms are the minor isoform suggesting the effects of the splicing events may be more subtle or could represent artifacts in library construction  <cit> . the ate class does not lead to a frameshift event and may reflect a clear way to generate proteomic diversity by translating completely different sequences in these terminal exons. manual inspection revealed that this is common, but cases also exist where the ate is actually in the 3'utr and have no effect on translation. in the re and se classes, the data suggest that skipping or retaining exons will commonly lead to a frameshift in the translated sequence although these cases are the least frequently observed.

a total of  <dig> arabidopsis fl-cdna supported alternatively spliced assemblies were compared with  <dig> reference assemblies . the data for arabidopsis are quite similar to that observed in rice, particularly for the most frequently observed classes of alternative splicing .

discussion
this study presents a large scale analysis of alternative splicing profiles in the rice genome. in addition, a parallel analysis in arabidopsis was performed for comparative purposes. publicly available fl-cdnas and ests were used with the pasa program to generate maximal transcript alignment assemblies and to cluster the assemblies according to alternative splicing isoforms. pasa-generated clusters having more than one assembly were screened for each of the nine classes of alternative splicing classes. in addition to enumerating the splicing variations found, we examined the underlying transcript supporting evidence to evaluate variations as major or minor isoforms. finally, we localized splicing variations to the cds and utr regions of gene structures and assessed the effects of alternative splicing on the translated products of the isoforms.

when evaluating the clusters, the ri class was the most frequent for both rice  and arabidopsis . previous results in arabidopsis and rice using an est clustering strategy showed that the ri class is the most frequent  <cit> . however, by excluding the single exon transcripts, we observed fewer ri events  than a recent report  <cit> . by localizing variations to the cds or utr of fl-assembly based gene structures, we found the ri isoform to be largely contained in the coding sequence , often leading to the inclusion of an in-frame ptc. comparison of the si assembly to its ri counterpart shows that the ri assembly has equal or greater transcript support for 43% of isoform pairs in rice and 30% in arabidopsis. thus, the ri class is the prevalent isoform in a sizable minority of cases.

the aa class is the second most frequently encountered class in the clusters from both of these species. studies with mammalian est clustering strategies revealed that the maximal occurrence of the distance between two alternate acceptor splice sites is  <dig> bp  <cit> , which we also observed in both rice and arabidopsis. a cag tandem repeat is the most common sequence at these acceptor splice sites, consistent with the reports in mammalian and plant species  <cit> . additionally, the pictograms reveal a paucity of g nucleotides in the nagnag duplication, another feature in agreement with mammalian research  <cit> . additional studies will be needed to determine the rates of proximal and distal usage in the nagnag motif where the aa events have the maximal occurrence. in vitro research on closely spaced tandem ag acceptors has shown that both acceptors are competitive when the distance between them is less than  <dig> bp and within 19– <dig> bp of the branch point sequence  <cit> . the highest occurrences of binned delta bps for the aa class for rice and arabidopsis range from three bp to six bp which supports the in vitro results. however, a propensity toward alternative splicing has also been noted in genes that have unusually large distances  from the identified branch point to the acceptor site, and this interim sequence is hypothesized to contain splicing signal motifs  <cit> . a systematic analysis of aa events in higher plants will be necessary to identify how these closely spaced alternate acceptors are utilized and to compare the results with those from mammalian systems.

the peak occurrence for the length between alternate donor splice sites was found to be  <dig> bp and the second most frequent value was  <dig> bp in both plant species. these maximal occurrence values for the ad class have been previously reported in mouse  <cit> . in addition, for mammalian species, the ad distribution was reported to have a very low, ~ <dig> bp, periodicity from  <dig> bp up to  <dig> bp  <cit> . when considering the consensus sequence at the donor splice junction of ag|gtawgn derived from human consensus  with a strong requirement for a guanine at positions - <dig> and + <dig>  <cit> , our data supports the hypothesis that this  <dig> bp peak occurs when either the proximal or the distal gt is used as a donor   <cit> . unlike the aa class, there does not appear to be a consensus sequence between the two donor gt dinucleotides aside from a potential enrichment for purine nucleotides. akerman and mandel-gutfreund also hypothesized that a  <dig> bp difference in sequence length for the ad class would be "infrequent"  <cit> . however, the occurrence of a  <dig> bp ad difference in sequence length is equal to or greater than nearly all other length differences observed indicates flexibility in 5' splice site recognition in higher plants. in the ad class, we observed an elevated rate of the donor dinucleotide sequence gc for gt, a trait previously observed in humans and c. elegans  <cit> . a survey of ad splicing events across eukaryotes will be needed to determine whether the elevated rates of the gc donor in the ad class are conserved. as with the aa class, using the fl-cdna dataset, the majority of the ad class splicing events occur within the cds and the majority of the ad events lead to a translational frameshift.

the transcript support for the aa and ad classes is of particular interest with respect to potential for translational frameshift. the aa class occurs about twice the rate of the ad class. however, the transcript support histograms have a very similar profile. these histograms show that, while the alternative isoform is less frequent in nearly all cases, these alternative isoforms are neither rare nor isolated. the possibility of a frameshift in the majority of events having small differences in length indicate that the aa and ad classes in both rice and arabidopsis compare with the results in mouse  <cit> . using the fl-cdna as a reference for delineating the likely translated orf, seven of the nine classes of alternative splicing occur predominantly in the coding sequence and these events have a significant effect on the translated protein. prior work in other eukaryotic systems has suggested that alternatively spliced transcripts having a ptc are removed by non-sense mediated decay   <cit> . in mammals, degradation of ptc containing mrnas is induced by the presence of a ptc  <dig> bp  upstream of the exon/exon boundary in a spliced mrna  <cit> . signals leading to decay occur at the time of translation where exon junction complexes are displaced during translation and the presence of a termination codon before an exon junction induces nmd of the transcript  <cit> . nmd is observed in all eukaryotic species that have been examined and these ptc-containing mrnas are rapidly degraded  <cit> . a recent report suggested that nearly one-third of all alternative splicing events in human meet the criteria for nmd-mediated degradation and this phenomenon was termed regulated unproductive splicing and translation   <cit> . the conservation of rust in higher plants has not been described in any detail yet. however the presence of an nmd-like pathway in plants was first suggested by studies showing reduced stability of mrnas containing ptcs. studies on mutants of waxy mrna containing ptcs in rice  have suggested that splicing of the first intron present upstream of ptc is important for nmd of mutant waxy mrna  <cit> . also, nonsense but not missense mutants of xantha mrna in barley  appear to be subjected to rapid degradation, even though the mutant mrna contains ptc in the last exon  <cit> . despite these findings, the mechanism of nmd in plants and its role in plant growth and development have not been clarified. in addition, there has been a recent study on the function of plant upfs which showed that upf <dig> of arabidopsis suppresses aberrantly spliced mrnas containing ptcs  <cit> .

interestingly, when restricting the alternative splicing analysis to the utrs, the aa, ad, ri and se classes are found to occur far more frequently in the 5'utr than in the 3' utr. given that est coverage is known to be 3' biased due to the nature of cdna library generation, the 5'utr bias for alternative splicing is notable. following the rule for nmd, these 5'utr localized events are assumed not to be involved in this post-transcriptional control pathway nor altering  the coding sequence. a recent report using est alignments in human also identified an enrichment of alternative splicing in the 5'utr compared to the 3' utr and the authors suggested this may represent a method for translational control  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
alternative splicing has also been proposed as a mechanism to expand the proteomic diversity within a genome. as the est collections for rice and arabidopsis have dramatically increased, successive reports have greatly expanded the number of identified alternative splicing isoforms. the data presented here suggest that, while alternative splicing may produce novel translated combinations of the primary amino acid sequence, there is also a large number of transcripts produced by the aa, ad, and ri classes having either frameshifts or ptcs that may have a role in post-transcriptional regulation. these new data will need to be explored via experimentation to determine whether rust and nmd-mediated pathways are degrading these alternatively spliced transcripts.
