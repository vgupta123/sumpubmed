BACKGROUND
many plant species show a wide geographical range across contrasting ecological environments. reciprocal transplantation experiments of ecotypes from different geographic origins in a common garden, provided evidence for local adaptation within the species range that resulted in fitness differences  <cit> . local adaptation by means of natural selection affects both the interaction with the abiotic environment, such as soil, temperature or photoperiod, as well as biotic interactions with competitors, pathogens and pollinators  <cit> . frequently, plant species show a high level of phenotypic variation among ecotypes in morphology, phenology and biochemistry that is geographically structured  <cit> . the high levels of phenotypic diversity lead to a key question: which traits are polymorphic due to natural selection and which ones result from the differential fixation of random mutations by genetic drift? since plants are sessile organisms showing highly structured populations and a propensity for self-fertilization, random drift is expected to play a significant role in local populations. therefore, one of the central goals of plant evolutionary biology is to disentangle the effects of both processes, to identify traits under selection and the genes controlling these traits.

natural accessions of arabidopsis thaliana are characterized by a high level of phenotypic variation in morphological, developmental, metabolic, resistance and reproductive traits  <cit> . since a. thaliana shows a large distribution range throughout the northern hemisphere  <cit>  and grows in highly differentiated local habitats, it is ideally suited to investigate the roles of drift and selection in phenotypic variation. for example, flowering time and the vernalisation response show a latitudinal gradient across europe  <cit> , suggesting local adaptation to different day lengths. early flowering plants with a summer annual habit are predominately observed in southern europe whereas late flowering plants with a strong vernalisation response tend to occur in northern europe. major candidate genes controlling flowering time and vernalisation response have been identified and allelic variation segregating at these loci shows evidence of positive darwinian selection  <cit> . a similar variation in flowering time was also observed in other species, indicating that latitudinal pattern does not result from past historical processes like the re-colonization of glacial habitats and the fixation of new mutations by genetic drift, but resembles local adaptation. genes that mediate resistance to pathogens  are also well known to be highly polymorphic in a. thaliana  <cit>  and indications of various modes of selection acting on these genes have been obtained  <cit> .

in addition to flowering time and pathogen resistance, the utilization of available resources is of central importance for plant fitness. nutrient availability and the environmental conditions influencing carbon fixation show a high level of spatial and temporal variation. very substantial variation of biomass accumulation and metabolite composition has recently been observed across a. thaliana accessions  <cit>  suggesting that local adaptation involves changes in metabolic traits that may result from natural selection. in a. thaliana, a positive correlation between above-ground biomass and fecundity was found  <cit>  as well as a strong correlation between biomass and the metabolic profile in a recombinant inbred line population of two genetically divergent accessions  <cit> . a subsequent analysis of  <dig> a. thaliana accessions uncovered much phenotypic variation in more than  <dig> metabolites and significant negative correlations between biomass and several metabolites  <cit> . this work also revealed starch as a major integrator of the metabolic response. allelic variation at two candidate genes, whose expression is affected by carbon regulation are associated with biomass, thereby providing a target for natural selection. while positive selection has been shown to operate on genes involved in the synthesis of compounds involved in plant defence and to drive diversification in plant secondary metabolism  <cit> , and despite the documentation of significant genetic variation in enzyme activities of primary  metabolism in a. thaliana  <cit> , very little information is available on the extent and mode of selection on primary metabolic traits in plants.

hybridization-based arrays have been used to address a broad range of questions related to genomic variation  <cit> , such as the identification of natural variation between closely related organisms  <cit> . tiling arrays hold sets of microarray hybridization probes that contain both genic and non-genic portions of the genome and can be used to discover polymorphisms throughout the entire genome. such polymorphisms are called single feature polymorphisms  because they differ from a common reference sequence. although the exact nature of polymorphism in sfps is difficult to identify they have been established to be a useful alternative to the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> .

in the present study we seek to widen the scope of previous genotyping experiments by increasing the number of studied accessions and the density of sfp calling and by broadening the analysis to include representative primary metabolic traits. two previous studies both investigated ~ <dig> accessions with two different types of arrays: the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray  <cit>  and the perlegen high density re-sequencing microarray  <cit> . while the high density re-sequencing arrays provide the best possible resolution available for a hybridization-based approach, high cost limits the number of accessions that can be investigated. the ath <dig> microarray on the other hand is limited to ~ <dig> probes per annotated gene. by using the affymetrix arabidopsis tiling  <dig>  array and analysing  <dig> accessions, we substantially increased the coverage of the a. thaliana population analysed by deep genotyping and phenotyping at the cost of not covering29% of the genome and not knowing the exact nature of the underlying polymorphism. we also aim to add to the type of traits studied in a. thaliana by including phenotypic and metabolic data. metabolic traits have been chosen primarily based on their correlation with biomass in a set of  <dig> accessions  <cit> . five of them significantly correlated with biomass  while three metabolites did not show any significant correlation . using both types of data, we tested associations between metabolic and growth-related traits such as fresh weight, protein content and metabolite levels and polymorphisms of metabolic genes. in a further step we demonstrate how genome-wide sfps can be used to detect genomic regions showing signs of recent selection that are associated with phenotypic variation in metabolic traits. our goal was to identify genomic regions and genes that harbor genetic variation that played a role during the recent history of a. thaliana and may have contributed to local adaptation and to use the physiological data to seek indications of the involvement of changes in growth and metabolic features. we achieved this by identification of regions with unusual haplotype structures that may have resulted from the rapid fixation of advantageous mutations and by testing for significant associations with phenotypic variation in the aforementioned growth-related and metabolic traits.

RESULTS
patterns of sfp diversity
using affymetrix arabidopsis tiling  <dig>  arrays, high density sfp maps for  <dig> genetically diverse a. thaliana accessions were created. an analysis of various possible sfp prediction criteria using a linear discriminant analysis  reveals that the log base  <dig> -fold change between col- <dig> and non-col- <dig> arrays accounts for greater than 99% of the predictive power and is more discriminatory than other tested predictive variables including well established and previously used statistical measures such as significance analysis of microarrays  or student's t-test . based on these results, a threshold to the log2-fold change in order to call sfps based on hybridization signals was applied as it provides the best sensitivity and specificity with the lowest computational time.

the quality of the predicted sfps for  <dig> accessions was tested against the  <dig> dataset of snps determined by sequencing  <cit>  using receiver operator characteristic  plots. a threshold of - <dig>   was applied to the log2-fold change based on the plots as it produced a suitable false discovery rate  across the  <dig> accessions. at this threshold, we were able to predict sfps at fdrs between  <dig> % and  <dig> % . the false negative rates  were estimated to be between 60% and 70% when compared to the  <dig> dataset. these relatively high fnrs were due to the stringent threshold set to reduce the number of false positives. false negatives, i.e. probes showing weak differences in signal intensities upon hybridization with perfect match dna versus mismatch dna are probably caused by cumulative effects of properties of the probes and the nature of the sequence polymorphisms: the position of an snp in a probe, the number of snps in a probe and the %g+c of probe  all affected the observed fold changes in signal. the effect of three properties on the probe signal intensity was also tested. by using only probes with a single exact match to the a. thaliana genome to call sfps, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> sfp sites across  <dig> accessions. the overall sfp density distribution as well as the corresponding gene density across all five arabidopsis chromosomes is plotted in figure  <dig>  based on calculations using the  <dig> accessions shared with the  <dig> dataset, 15% of the predicted sfp sites are estimated to have more than two alleles. it can be expected that this proportion increases with more accessions. on average,  <dig>  sfps were called per accession ranging from  <dig>  in co- <dig> to  <dig>  in h-o-g . our control, col- <dig>  is used as the reference genome on the array, and produced only  <dig>  sfps, thus confirming the applied sfp calling procedure produces a low fdr.

using the tair <dig> genomic annotation information  <cit> , we compared the observed number of sfp sites in genomic features with the expected number under the assumption of a random sfp distribution. for each genomic feature, we calculated the significance of the difference from random expectation using an unpaired students t-test. as expected, sfp site frequency per nucleotide is significantly reduced in functional regions of the chromosomes . interestingly, also intergenic regions showed a significantly lower than expected frequency of sfps. by contrast, there is a significantly higher than expected frequency of sfp sites per nucleotide in non-coding rna, pseudogenes, and transposons. introns, mirna, snrna and snorna show no significant difference from a random distribution.

for protein coding regions, we collated functional categories from tair and ncbi. of these  <dig> chosen gene families,  <dig> contained a significantly greater than random number of sfps and  <dig> contained significantly fewer sfps than expected from a random distribution. disease resistance, plant defence and signalling genes comprised the majority of the gene families, which were enriched in sfps. various transcriptions factors comprised the majority of the top  <dig> most significant gene families, which were observed depleted in sfps .

deletions and duplications
using the affymetrix arabidopsis tiling  <dig>  array, consecutive stretches of sfps were observed that may be caused by an accumulation of many sequence alterations in a certain region resulting in highly deviant non-col- <dig> alleles or may be due to deletions. thus, to classify such regions as deletions it was assumed that strong sequence deviations of non-col- <dig> alleles are likely to be confined to short stretches of coding regions and, therefore, consecutive sfp stretches that were longer than the average a. thaliana exon were deletions . for simplicity, the same threshold was applied to detecting duplications.  <dig>  deleted regions with a mean length of  <dig>  bp  were observed. a small minority of the deleted regions occur across many accessions; however, the majority occur in only one. the accessions show a broad range in the number of deleted regions ranging from  <dig> in co- <dig> to  <dig> in dal- <dig>  with a mean of  <dig> deleted regions per accession . many of the areas with a high sfp density are explained by an abundance of deletions. of the chosen gene families, the combined length of deletions is largest in nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat  genes and smallest in bhlh transcription factors .

for duplications we chose a threshold of  <dig> consecutive sfp sites with a fold change of greater than 4-fold as a conservative estimate of duplication. we detected  <dig>  duplicated regions, with a mean length of  <dig>  bp. similar to deleted regions, the majority of duplications occurred only in a single accession, while a small minority occurred in many accessions. the accessions also showed a range in the number of duplicated regions from  <dig> in blh- <dig> to  <dig> in shakdara, with a mean of  <dig> duplicated regions per accession . like deletions and sfps, nbs-lrr and f-box genes had the highest total length of duplicated regions, whereas many other categories were not represented in duplicated regions at all . however, in this case, the enrichment in duplications was not significant for these gene families although it remained significant for mads-box transcription factors and glycoside hydrolase. it is of note that the same gene classes show a high frequency of insertions and deletions.

choice of phenotypic traits
nine phenotypic traits were selected from a larger data set, including rosette fresh weight  and eight metabolic traits; five of which showed significant correlations with rosette fw  <cit> . all of the measured traits used in the association study were shown to be normally distributed. minimum, maximum and median values are summarized in the additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> .

population structure analysis
the analysis of population structure with both the sfp data and independently genotyped snps confirms the existence of population structure, even among accessions from central europe. it was previously thought that they represent admixture zones since past glaciation events  <cit> . a structure analysis  <cit> http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html identified four major clusters of accessions . these clusters separate the central asian, eastern european, central/western european and iberian accessions. a high proportion of the central european and eastern european accessions are admixed individuals, probably reflecting the effect of postglacial population admixture and subsequent genomic recombination in suture zones. the structure analysis on snp data is supported by clustering based on pairwise distance of the sfp data . distance matrices from both marker systems are highly correlated. the snp markers also show a significant correlation between geographic and genetic distance although it is weak, possibly because of the large proportion of individuals from central europe and the disturbance of the geographic distribution by human agriculture. taken together, the population structure analysis indicates the need for correction of population structure for this sample in the subsequent association study.

association testing
association testing was performed between  <dig>  unique sfp sites, with a minor allele frequency of at least 5%, and all nine phenotypic traits using a general linear model  as implemented in the tassel program  <cit>  providing an empirical distribution of f-scores from which the p-values for each marker were calculated. the effects of population structure were controlled for by using a q-matrix estimated in structure and based on  <dig> snps and four populations  as described in the additional file  <dig>  section  <dig> . we applied a significance threshold of p = 1e- <dig> to obtain  <dig>  significantly associated sfps for which we estimate a fdr of 45% based on the empirical distribution as only  <dig> random association would be expected at this significance threshold. we chose to tolerate this threshold to provide sufficient numbers of associations for later downstream analysis. however, for later experimental analysis a much more stringent threshold such as p = 1e- <dig> will yield a more favourable fdr of 20%. for a detailed bioinformatics analysis, we focused on  <dig>  metabolic sfp sites, defined as the full set of sfps detected in the  <dig>  metabolic genes annotated in aracyc, which allows a direct connection to be made between any significantly associated metabolite and metabolic genes associated with that metabolite via known metabolic pathway relationships. after mapping each sfp site to metabolic genes,  <dig> metabolic genes were found to significantly associate with fresh weight,  <dig> genes with starch,  <dig> genes with sucrose,  <dig> genes with total protein,  <dig> genes with total amino acids, and  <dig> genes with threonic acid . for the three metabolites not correlated with fresh weight ,  <dig> metabolic genes were found to associate with β-alanine,  <dig> genes with erythritol, and  <dig> genes with myo-inositol. the significantly associated genes, along with the average trait measurement of each phenotype for col- <dig> and non-col- <dig> can be found in the additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> . in total, a non-redundant set of  <dig> metabolic genes associate with the nine traits. interestingly,  <dig> genes were associated with more than one trait. in ten cases, the associations with the different traits were by the same sfp, while in the other seven cases the different traits were associated with different sfps within the same gene. a mann-whitney u was used to test the f-scores of metabolic sfps against the remaining non-metabolic sfps and showed no significant  deviation from the empirical distribution implying that metabolic genes in general are not specifically implicated in the phenotypic variation of the tested traits.

to investigate whether genes serving functions other than metabolic ones may be more likely associated with the metabolic traits examined here, we correlated the total association f-score across all metabolic trait associations with the metabolic gene density for all five chromosomes. generally, there were no significant correlations detectable, except for chromosome  <dig>  for which a positive correlation was found supporting the notion of metabolic genes being more likely associated with metabolic genes than other gene categories on this chromosome .

to provide a broad overview, the pathways significantly over/under-represented in the associations were identified using a mann-whitney u test by comparing the f-scores belonging to the sfps annotated with a particular pathway with those of the remaining metabolic pathways. after multiple testing correction  <dig> pathways were found to be significantly more associated with their respective traits than the remaining pathways. four pathways, associating with sucrose, show significant  deviation from the metabolic sfp f-scores,  <dig> each for myo-inositol and total protein content, two for starch and threonic acid, and one for erythritol and fresh weight . that significantly over-represented pathways were detected may indicate that the fdr for associations is lower than estimated.

analysis of selective sweeps
putative selective sweep regions were identified by detection of unusual patterns of shared haplotypes among accessions based on the notion that genomic regions with selected haplotypes will be longer than regions without selected haplotypes due to hitchhiking of linked variation with the selected mutation  <cit> . hence, young and selected alleles will be surrounded by extensive linkage disequilibrium  which produces longer haplotypes, while older alleles would show lower ld due to recombination. plots of pairwise sfp haplotype sharing indicate regions with high levels of haplotype sharing . we used the pairwise haplotype sharing score , which was previously applied to a. thaliana data  <cit> . five significant sweep regions were identified and designated as sr <dig> to sr <dig> . these regions show a high proportion of significantly scoring sfps with unusual haplotype patterns.

candidates were called from proportion of high phs in a sliding window of  <dig> sfps . the focal sfp is the highest scoring sfp in the candidate region.

the phs-test provides the length of the haplotype around each allele and thus the allele with the longer haplotype is likely to be the selected allele. the selected alleles for sweeps regions 1- <dig> are non-col- <dig>  col- <dig>  col- <dig>  non-col- <dig> and non-col- <dig>  respectively. the neighbouring tendencies of the geographic locations for like-alleles in each of the five detected sweeps were calculated using a mann-whitney u test to compare the distances of like alleles in each sweep against those based on  <dig>  shuffled variations . this shows that the alleles in sweeps sr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have significant neighbouring tendencies with p-values of  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively. combined, these results show that sr <dig> col- <dig> alleles cluster in central europe in germany, switzerland and czech republic, the sr <dig> col- <dig> accessions cluster strongly around western germany and around the belarusian/russian border, and the sr <dig> non-col- <dig> accessions cluster around western germany, austria, switzerland, and northern europe.

the candidate regions range from a length of  <dig> kb  to  <dig> kb  and the average length of haplotype sharing around the focal sfp ranges from  <dig>  kb  to  <dig>  kb . the genome-wide highest scoring sfp is located in sr <dig> and, thus, was chosen as focal sfp for this region. for the other srs, focal sfps were chosen similarly as the highest scoring sfp in the candidate region. the f-scores of the focal sfps indicate that only sr <dig> associates significantly  with starch. however, the f-scores for all the markers contained within the sweeps, according to a mann-whitney u test, show a slight but significant bias  towards higher values indicating that markers within sweep regions are more likely to be associated with one of the nine traits than those outside the sweep regions.

discussion
genotyping through hybridization of genomic dna to genome tiling arrays as applied in this study is characterized by an extraordinarily high degree of multiplexation surpassing all other genotyping methods except the use of whole-genome re-sequencing microarrays  <cit>  and genome re-sequencing using second generation sequencing methods  <cit> : the arabidopsis tiling  <dig>  array represents  <dig> , <dig> sites, each  <dig> nucleotides in length, of the arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genome of which  <dig> , <dig> occur uniquely, and can thus be simultaneously used for identification and localization of sequence variation detected as a substantial deviation of the obtained hybridization signal from that of the reference . through the use of affymetrix arabidopsis tiling  <dig>  arrays, we were able to monitor, in a collection of  <dig> different non-reference accessions, over one million high quality sfps. this substantially expands previous data sets  <cit> . furthermore, we could detect haplotypes and selective sweeps, and associate metabolic and phenotypic traits with the responsible genomic regions. we confirm that sfp monitoring is a viable and cost efficient alternative to snp typing as proposed by kim et al.  <cit>  and also demonstrated by borevitz et al.  <cit> , which  does not depend on prior knowledge of sequence variation.

using known sequence information   <cit>  of  <dig> a. thaliana accessions that were also used in this study, we confirmed that the method used here is suitable for detection of high quality sfps. the obtained fdrs ranging from  <dig> and 16% are similar or lower than those reported in previous studies  <cit> , which may be due to improvements of the data normalization and/or the metric used for snp calling or due to higher stringency. the latter is reflected in a relatively high fnr of about 65%. despite the limitations of the approach, which lie in coverage , obscurity  and novel/duplicate sequence , we were able to create high density sfp maps. on average we predicted approximately  <dig>  sfps per accession, which is equivalent to about one sfp per  <dig> bp of genomic sequence in each pair-wise comparison of an accession with the reference. about 25% to 30% of the sfps detected in this study were previously identified as sequence polymorphisms in each of the  <dig> accessions that were also investigated by clark et al.  <cit>  using resequencing microarrays . the limited overlap between the two data sets may be explained partly by the difference in coverage and partly by the different snp/sfp detection procedures used in the two approaches: the resequencing microarray hybridization data were analysed based on differential hybridization of  <dig> oligonucleotides for each position in the genome in order to infer base substitutions  <cit> . this approach is sensitive to further adjacent polymorphisms that interfere with the hybridization to all  <dig> oligonucleotides  <cit> . in contrast, sfp calling based on signal intensity comparisons of individual probes between hybridizations of dna from a particular accession and from the reference is even enhanced at sites with two or more mismatches. the reliability of the data is not only verified by the  <dig> dataset but also by a phylogenetic tree that we were also able to construct, based on the sfps , that groups the accessions according to their geographic location .

the frequency of sfps among the genomic features shows greater selective pressure on functional regions of the genome especially in coding areas, rrna and trna. sfps occurring in pseudogenes, transposons and non-coding rna  appear to be under much reduced selective pressure and, in some accessions, can accumulate to rates as high as one sfp every  <dig> bp. of the remaining genomic regions, it is remarkable that non-repetitive intergenic regions also experience a relatively low mutation rate, even lower than that of coding regions. this could be indicative of hitherto largely undiscovered functional regions in the a. thaliana genome including regulatory sites.

in addition to individual sfp sites, regions of multiple, immediately neighbouring, polymorphisms were detected. consecutive stretches of  <dig> or more polymorphic sites , all showing reduced signals, were classified as deletions. across the  <dig> accessions almost  <dig> deleted regions of a mean length of approx.  <dig>  kb were detected, most of which occur in only a single accession and on average  <dig> deletions were detected per accession with a total length of  <dig> kbp. according to the threshold of  <dig> consecutive sfp sites, smaller deletions were not considered as they could not be readily distinguished from instances of multiple snps or multiple small indels in close vicinity. furthermore, as only probes with a unique occurrence in the genome sequence were considered, this analysis was restricted to non-repetitive col sequence. the fraction of deleted genome sequences detected here can thus be regarded as a conservative minimum number. conversely, regions were called duplicated if  <dig> or more adjacent probes displayed greater than a two-fold increase in hybridization signal. again, the total of about  <dig> duplicated regions of an average length of approx.  <dig>  kb  has to be regarded as a minimum number. the notion of substantial variation in presence or copy number of genomic sequences in a. thaliana accessions is supported by the previous observation of  <dig> indels larger than  <dig> bp detected in  <dig> mbp shotgun sequence of the ler- <dig> accession when compared to the col- <dig> sequence, where 93% of the indels identified in total were shorter than  <dig> bp  <cit> . a remarkable variation in nuclear dna content has been observed through very accurate flow cytometry of  <dig> a. thaliana accessions  <cit> . this analysis revealed approx. 10% higher dna content in the accessions with the largest genomes as compared to those with the lowest values. interestingly, the col- <dig> accession, whose full genome sequence has been used to design the arabidopsis tiling  <dig>  array, had the lowest genome content of the  <dig> accessions analysed. throughout the present study we observed fewer duplications than deletions in the  <dig> accession analysed. while it remains to be analysed how much of the variation in genomic dna across accessions is accounted for by repetitive dna, our results indicate that the additional dna in the accessions with larger genomes is not merely caused by increased copy numbers of sequences present in the col- <dig> accession . thus, a substantial fraction of the genome complement of the a. thaliana species represented by the additional nuclear dna in many accessions is apparently yet uncharacterized.

while the detected duplications are so rare that they do not affect any of the analysed gene families of in most accessions, their occurrence in some functional categories is particularly striking in a few accessions: for example,  <dig>  bp of the nbs-lrr disease resistance genes are duplicated in accession el- <dig>  this is significantly more than the expected  <dig> bp. in a similar case,  <dig>  bp of the mads-box transcription factors are duplicated in the wei- <dig> accession.

the obtained polymorphism information was used to investigate the degrees of diversity among a broad range of functional gene classes. whether they are duplications, deletions or individual sfps, there are a much greater number of polymorphisms than expected at random in disease resistance and defence related gene families . across a broad geographic range, an encounter with a large spectrum of pathogens can be expected and the high occurrence of polymorphisms in the resistance genes reflects the need for defence genes to adapt to the local pathogens and environmentally specific challenges. among the genes that have the most significantly greater number of sfps than expected, are the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat , anthranilate synthase, f-box, terpene and monooxygenase gene families. all these gene families are either directly involved or implicated in plant defence. transmembrane receptor, thioredoxin, leucine-rich repeat kinase, receptor-like kinase, and wall-associated protein kinase gene families and a subset of the proteins encoded by the other genes families identified to be highly polymorphic are involved in inter- and intracellular signalling potentially reflecting variation in responses to external and internal signals that may be relevant for local adaptation. f-box, nbs-lrr and transmembrane receptor genes have been previously identified as having a high number of polymorphisms  <cit> . on the other hand, many transcription factors, calmodulin binding genes, helicases, abc transporters, glycosyl transferases, and acyl lipid metabolism genes contain significantly fewer sfps than expected. proteins encoded by these genes thus appear to be involved in more conserved processes.

as a first step towards investigating the viability of genome-wide associations testing for the identification of functionally relevant sequence variation, we subjected all sfp sites to association tests with nine phenotypic traits including total biomass , starch content, total protein content, total amino acid content, and contents of five individual metabolites  and starch degradation with starch. although these annotations may accurately describe the association, it is probable that it is the combined effect of many genes that produce variation in the associated phenotype. nevertheless, these examples indicate that sfp-based association testing leads to the identification of polymorphisms in genes with  metabolic function, that are worth to be further investigated as they may lead to the discovery of functionally relevant variation.

based on the minimum paths calculated between the metabolic genes and the significantly associated metabolites, a considerable number of gene-metabolite pairs were found to have no known connection. for example the associations between at1g <dig>  and erythritol, at2g <dig>  and myo-inositol, or at1g <dig>  and threonic acid. while some of these associations may be false positives, at least a subset of them may hint to hitherto unknown or un-annotated connections between the gene products and the associated metabolites. an observed association may however also be caused by linkage disequilibrium and thus a neighbouring gene or mutation may be responsible for the change in metabolite level. a further interesting possible process causing seemingly functionally unrelated gene-metabolite associations may be co-evolution. in previous studies a certain combination of a large number of metabolite levels rather that individual metabolite levels were found to correlate well with plant biomass  <cit>  and multiple metabolite - metabolite correlations were observed  <cit> . thus, adaptation to certain environments may involve numerous metabolic modifications that may lead to detectable associations although the gene products and the associated metabolite reside in unlinked metabolic pathways and thus are only connected through higher level functional integration. such considerations may warrant follow-up studies on the metabolites of the pathways the detected gene products are involved with and on their correlations with the associated compounds identified here.

using the pairwise haplotype sharing score  as criterion to identify regions with signs of recent selection, five candidate selective sweep regions, sr <dig> through sr <dig> were identified. the fnr leads to an overestimation of col haplotype length and an underestimation von non-col haplotypes; however, three of our sweeps are non-col alleles. due to the interference of the fnr on sweep detection, the sweep analysis should be considered preliminary. the applied phs test was not able to show significant signatures of selection in the candidate regions previously suggested by clark et al.  <cit> . although we found extensive haplotype sharing in one of their candidates on chromosome  <dig>  this region showed no clear peak in phs density even if we relaxed the threshold for significant scores. this discrepancy might be caused by the different composition of our sample, but the most important difference may be the method used for the identification of sweep candidates. clark et al. simply identified regions with a low diversity over a long range. the phs test compares the length of the different haplotypes around a core allele and, additionally, accounts for the population structure and local recombination rate. hence, the phs test represents a more rigid measurement to identify selective sweeps then the approach by clark et al.  <cit> . the power of the phs test to detect true positive signals of selective sweeps is demonstrated by the identification of candidate region sr <dig>  this region includes the gene frigida, which is a major regulator of flowering time and which was previously identified to evolve under selection  <cit> .

a relative overrepresentation of sfps with extreme phs values  was observed in nbs-lrr protein-encoding genes. this suggests that these genes are preferred targets of selection in a. thaliana in addition to being highly polymorphic . the other functional class significantly enriched in extreme phs values  is the receptor-like kinases genes-category. interestingly, although cytoplasmic ribosomal protein genes and f-box genes are among the most highly polymorphic genes , none of the chosen gene families show significant enrichment or depletion in the sweep. due to the obscurity of the sfps, it is hard to exclude that the identified sweep regions may in fact represent multiple independent sweeps in the same region. however, it has been shown that the power to detect sweeps based on their haplotype structure is reduced if more than one sweep occurs in the same region  <cit> . thus, the identified candidates most likely represent single sweeps and can be regarded as biallelic for the associations although the strength may be overestimated.

the  <dig> non-col accessions investigated here have been thoroughly characterized with respect to their biomass accumulated during growth in controlled condition and they have been investigated for more than  <dig> metabolic parameters including protein and chlorophyll contents, starch, a large number of low molecular weight metabolites and several enzyme activities  <cit> . substantial variation in biomass accumulation and many of the metabolic traits as well as complex relations between them were observed raising the question whether or not this is a result of recent selection related to adaptation that occurred during the recent evolution of a. thaliana. as a first step towards addressing this question, associations were tested between the selected haplotypes of the sweeps and plant fresh weight as well as eight metabolic traits chosen as representatives of different groups of cellular components including structural and storage compounds as well as central metabolic intermediates. a significant association was detected between one of the five sweep regions  and starch. furthermore, sr <dig> coincides with a strong biomass qtl and a metabolite qtl hot spot detected in the col-0/c <dig> ril and il populations  <cit>  and this region furthermore confers heterosis of biomass and  <dig> metabolites  <cit> . although sr <dig> exhibits a considerable population structure, we do not assume that the association is confounded by it. the signal is retained after different corrections for population structure in the phs test and the glm and is further supported by the presence of the qtl. this indicates that at least some of the metabolic differences between the accessions analysed here occurred as a result of or are coincidental with recent selection. while further analysis will be required to investigate which traits controlled by which genes within the sweep regions were driving the selection, the observations made in this study provide a hint that genes within the sweep regions may contribute directly or indirectly to the metabolic diversity represented in the a. thaliana population. these regions do not include known metabolic genes and the results may thus open the opportunity to identify genes with hitherto unknown enzymatic or regulatory function.

as sweeps are likely due to positive selection and thus should have an observable impact on phenotypic variation, it is expected that a significantly greater number of sweep sfp sites should associate with the measured traits than those that are randomly chosen and the sweep marker-trait association result presented supports this hypothesis. however, only a small number of phenotypes were tested. to truly test this hypothesis, a larger number of phenotypes need to be included in the association mapping.

due to the large proportion of false negatives, the size and number of the predicted sweeps are likely to be reduced along with the number of associations. the false negatives are not likely to impact the quality of the associations and sweeps as they reduce existing signal rather than add noise. that is, in association mapping the correlation between high/low metabolite levels and presence/absence of a sfp can only be reduced by false negatives and similarly for detecting sweeps. false positives can increase the noise and lead to false associations and sweeps. however, these are estimated to be called at low rates and as they are randomly distributed throughout the genomes, their impact on the quality of the results is further reduced.

natural selection mapping versus molecular genetics
we have identified genomic regions with genetic variation that are associated significantly with growth-related metabolic traits in greenhouse conditions. even though the phenotypic analysis was not conducted under natural conditions or in nature itself, the associations strongly suggest the location of variants that have a robust effect on complex traits. it can not be excluded, though, that in nature or evolutionary history, a different phenotypic effect of the selected region may have been selected. furthermore, the region is large, and the phenotypic effect could hitchhike with the selected mutation, that in fact is responsible for another type of phenotypic variation.

a critical issue in natural selection mapping is the age of the sweeps. even though phenotypic variation is associated with the sweep, it may not necessarily be the trait that evolved under selection, but may even be a  disadvantageous trait. if the sweep occurred recently, there may not have been much time for compensatory mutations to neutralize this phenotypic effect  <cit> .

nevertheless, this analysis represents a precedence of a viable procedure to identify genomic regions carrying functionally relevant variation in  genes, which is potentially involved in adaptation. on the one hand these results open the exciting opportunity to identify and characterize the genes responsible for the phenotypic variation of growth-related metabolic traits through the investigation of the sequence variation of the identified regions across the accession population and the functional analysis of the encoded genes and their alleles through phenotypic characterization of genetic substitution lines, mutants, and transgenic plants grown in a variety of conditions. they also indicate how powerful this approach will become in the near future upon availability of deep genotype/re-sequencing information and phenotypic data of hundreds of a. thaliana accessions.

CONCLUSIONS
by hybridizing genomic dna extracted from  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana accessions to arabidopsis tiling microarrays, we identified a large set of single feature polymorphisms, thereby generating a high density polymorphism map of arabidopsis thaliana. its analysis revealed a pronounced variability of resistance genes across geographic ranges and identified selective sweeps and associations between metabolic genes and metabolic phenotypes. several associations show a clear biological relationship, while many remain requiring further investigation.
