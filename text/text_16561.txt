BACKGROUND
in serum-free culture, primary mammary epithelial cells  proliferate for  <dig> ±  <dig> population doublings , after which they enter the first growth barrier: self-selection or m <dig> also named stasis  <cit> . thereafter, small cells can appear, and these cells proliferate for up to 40- <dig> pd, after which they enter the second growth barrier: replicative senescence or m <dig>  also called "agonescence"  <cit> . there are few reports of mammary epithelial cells  spontaneously overcoming proliferative barriers and leading to immortalization  <cit> .

immortalisation is a process where cultured cells escape senescence and acquire the ability to grow in culture indefinitely  <cit> . whether changes in gene expression accompany the spontaneous immortalisation of mecs is unclear, relevant data are available from cancer cells. it has been known that cellular replicative senescence is triggered by telomere shortening during each cell division  <cit> . telomerase reverse transcriptase  maintains telomere length by replicating the telomere tracts and preventing cells from replicative senescence  <cit> . overexpression of tert has been used to immortalize a variety of normal diploid cell strains  <cit> . in addition, tert gene has frequently been activated in cancer and stem cells  <cit> . the tumor suppressor p <dig>  which is inactivated in numerous cancer cells due to its gene mutation  <cit> , plays a key role in repressing transcription of tert gene  <cit> . another important tumor suppressor p16ink4a, a cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor, maintains normal cellular properties by preventing both centrosome dysfunction and genomic instability  <cit> . in mammary epithelial cells, it has been suggested that the pre-reduction of p16ink4a by a direct or indirect method is required for tert-mediated immortalisation  <cit> . in addition to the negative regulation of p16ink4a and p <dig> in the control of cell proliferation, some proto-oncogene such as c-myc and others may help cells to escape senescence control and lead to carcinogenesis  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether the expression patterns of these cellular oncogenes and tumor suppressors are altered in immortalized cells and what is the mechanism for spontaneous immortalization of mecs.

immortalised bovine mammary epithelial cell line can be used as an in vitro screening system to identify superior transgenes, and to improve genomic modification technological research, thereby improving the efficiency of transgenic animal production  <cit> . in this study, we described a spontaneously immortalised cell line  derived from serial passages of bovine mammary epithelial cells. we performed a detailed investigation of cell characteristics and changes in gene expression in comparison to early passage cells, senescent cells and human mammary cancer cells . our data showed that multiple signal pathways are involved in this process and bme65cs is distinct from malignant mcf- <dig> in cancer associated gene expression.

RESULTS
spontaneously immortalised bme65cs cells maintain the normal morphology and proliferation characteristic of normal bmecs
the spontaneously immortalised bme65cs cell line was established from in vitro cell culture. the initial cell focus was observed in a culture of bmecs cells when normal cells had entered the senescence state. this cell focus had a similar morphology to the early passage bmecs cells  and was surrounded by an annulus of senescent cells . in serum-containing culture, normal bmecs cells enter replicative senescence at pdl  <dig> , whereas bme65cs cells have been passed more than pdl  <dig>  continuous observation showed that before pdl  <dig> bme65cs had a doubling time of approximately  <dig> hours, which was similar to normal cells. at pdl  <dig>  although some of these cells become longer and less proliferative, a majority of cells remained epithelial morphology with a doubling time of approximately  <dig> hours . this observation is consistent with the growth rate assay . there was an adjustment phase required for bme65cs cells to become a stable cell line. interestingly, a small proportion of cells died in each passage.

bme65cs cells maintain many characteristics of normal mammary epithelial cells
the breast epithelial compartment comprises two distinct lineages: the luminal epithelial and the myoepithelial lineage. it has been suggested that in vitro, normal luminal epithelial cells from the human mammary gland immunostain for ck <dig> , esa  and muc- <dig>   <cit> , whereas myoepithelial cells are ck18+/esa-/muc- <cit> . to test if bme65cs cells are originated from the luminal epithelial or from myoepithelial, bme65cs cells were immunostained with these three antibodies. the results showed that bme65cs are ck18+/esa+/muc+ in accordance with normal bmecs. moreover, bme65cs, similar to normal bmec, showed a very slight signal in the staining of ck <dig>  a maker of myoepithelial cells  <cit>  .

cell cycle and apoptosis are very important functional parameters used to assess cellular metabolism and physiology. we determined the cell cycle distribution of bme65cs, early passage  and late passage  bmecs by flow cytometry. as shown in figure 3a, growth arrest in the g0/g <dig> and g2/m phases was observed in late bmecs, but not in bme65cs and early passage bmecs. moreover, the proportion of cells in the s phase was increased in bme65cs cells , but significantly decreased in late passage cells compared to early passage bmecs cells, suggesting that bme65cs cell line has a higher proliferative capacity than that of normal cells.

to identify senescent state, a senescence marker, senescence-associated β-galactosidase , was examined in bme65cs  as well as the control bmecs . sa-β-gal staining was observed in late passage bmecs cells  and was not observed in early passage bmecs cells . as expected, approximately 10% of bme65cs cells  stained for sa-β-gal , consistent with the culture observation. this suggests that some of the immortalised bme65cs cells still undergo senescence in normal culture conditions.

the growth of bme65cs cells in serum-containing medium is dependent on the supplementation of insulin, epidermal growth factor and hydrocortisone, displaying normal bmecs cell growth characteristics. in comparison, the breast cancer cell line mcf- <dig> and the previously reported omec ii  grow very rapidly in serum-containing medium without any further additives  <cit> . to determine whether immortalised bme65cs cells have cancer cell potential, the soft agar assay for colony formation was performed. no colony was formed in bme65cs  and normal bmecs , while obvious colony formation in mcf- <dig> is obvious . furthermore, the cell-cell contact in bme65cs cells induced growth arrest . these results together suggested that bme65cs cells had a normal growth characteristic of anchor dependency and no tendency for malignant transformation  <cit> .

to understand the cytogenetic property of the bme65cs cell line, twenty-one metaphase spreads of pdl  <dig> were examined. nineteen of them maintained normal female karyotype , and only two cells appeared abnormal with  <dig>  xx karyotype . this differed from omec ii, in which 3-4% of the cells were heteroploid at an earlier stage  and 25% at passage  <dig>  <cit> . thus, the karyotype analysis indicated that the bme65cs cell line has stable cytogenetic properties.

telomere length was stabilised without further elongation in bme65cs cells
tert expression is thought to be an important factor for cellular immortalization  <cit> . to confirm whether endogenous btert is activated during immortalisation of bme65cs cells, the expression of btert mrna was detected by rt-pcr. as expected, btert was obviously transcribed in bme65cs cells  but silenced in control bmecs cells  .

next, telomere lengths were further assayed by southern hybridisation. the mean telomere length of terminal restriction fragments  in bme65cs cells  is  <dig>  kb. comparatively, trfs in bmecs cells at pdl  <dig> and pdl  <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively . this result suggests that telomere length is maintained in the bme65cs cell line.

gene expression profile was changed in bme65cs cells
cells that undergo immortalisation escape the controls of senescence and apoptosis. in order to gain insight into possible pathways involved in the bme65cs cell line immortalisation, we selected  <dig> genes regulated mainly at the level of transcription to investigate the differences in gene expression between bme65cs cells, senescent bmecs cells and early passage bmecs cells, as well as the mcf- <dig> cell line. analysis of transcription profiles indicated that transcription levels of several genes, which are important for cell survival and growth, are significantly altered in bme65cs comparing to the early passage bmecs .

it is well known that p16ink4a and p <dig> are important for cellular apoptosis and senescence. thus, we initially examined changes in expression of these two genes. both p16ink4a and p <dig> are significantly changed  in bme65cs cells, indicating the importance of p16ink4a and p <dig> signalling pathways in immortalisation of the bme65cs cell line. moreover, in senescent bmecs cells the expression of p16ink4a was unchanged, but there was a slight change in p <dig> , suggesting there is no correlation between the expression of p <dig> and p16ink4a. in mcf- <dig> cells, expression of both genes is undetectable . as the p <dig> protein is frequently absent in cancer cells  <cit> , we investigated p21cip <dig>  one of the downstream targets of p <dig> that functions in cell cycle regulation  <cit> , to enhance the result of p <dig>  paralleling the expression of p <dig>  an undetectable signal of p21cip1was observed in both bme65cs cells and mcf- <dig> cells, whereas a slight change  was observed in senescent cells .

next, we examined bcl- <dig> family genes. bcl- <dig> and bax act crucial roles in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by suppressing and improving apoptotic cell death, respectively  <cit> . expression of bcl- <dig> mrna was unchanged in bme65cs cells and was slightly downregulated  in senescent bmecs cells compared to early passaged bmecs cells, whereas expression of bcl- <dig> was significantly lower  in mcf- <dig> cells . bax mrna was upregulated  in senescent bmecs cells and downregulated  in mcf- <dig> cells. notably, bax mrna was not detected in bme65cs cells . moreover, expression of another anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> family gene, bag- <dig>  <cit> , was unchanged in the three non-cancer cells. as shown, bag- <dig> was undetectable in early passaged cells, senescent bmecs cells and bme65cs cells, whereas there was high expression in mcf- <dig> cells . thus, the expression of bcl- <dig>  bax and bag- <dig> in bme65cs cells was different from expression in mcf- <dig> cells. these results suggest that the immortalisation of the bme65cs line involved inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

to further understand the difference between spontaneously immortalised mecs and breast cancer cells, we investigated the expression of other genes considered to be differentially expressed or highly expressed in breast cancer cells. two genes, trps- <dig> and c-myc  <cit> , displayed the difference. trps- <dig> expression was undetectable in both bme65cs cells and early passage bmecs cells, which significantly distinguished from the high expression in mcf- <dig> cells. however, a low expression of trps- <dig> was shown in senescent cells . similarly, expression of c-myc was almost undetectable in early passage and senescent bmecs cells. although a low level of expression was detected in bme65cs cells, by contrast, c-myc was highly expressed in mcf- <dig> cells, about  <dig> fold higher than in bme65cs cells . therefore, in addition to bag- <dig>  the expression level of c-myc and trps- <dig> in bme65cs cells was also markedly different from that in mcf- <dig> cells.

to understand the possible changes of dna methylation that may cause altered gene expression in bme65cs cells, we examined three dna methyltransferases genes: dnmt <dig>  dnmt <dig> and dnmt <dig>  a significant difference was found for dnmt <dig>  as shown, dnmt <dig> mrna was upregulated in bme65cs cells , mcf- <dig> cells  and senescent cells . dnmt <dig>  is primarily a maintenance methylase, which reproduces dna methylation patterns from hemimethylated dna during cell division  <cit> . dnmt <dig> protein is disproportionately overexpressed in the s-phase fraction of estrogen receptor-negative cancer cell lines, including the mcf- <dig> line  <cit> . thus, the upregulation of dnmt <dig> in the bme65cs cell line suggests a possible change in dna methylation.

discussion
we have established a spontaneously immortalised mammary epithelial cell line, bme65cs. this cell line exhibits the majority of normal mecs features, whereas growth character, the ability to form colonies and expression of relevant breast tumor genes are significantly different from breast cancer cells . these data suggest that bme65cs cells are not derived from malignant transformations. whether or not in vitro spontaneous transformation is correlated with in vivo benign tumor transformation, the immortal bme65cs cell line will be a useful tool for studying the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis and cellular senescence. in contrast, tert or sv <dig> gene mediated immortalization by the random integration of exogenous genes may bring an unforeseeable influence on natural gene expression and regulation.

there are three types of human mammary epithelial cell progenitors have been identified. the first is thought to be a luminal-restricted progenitor; the second type is a bipotent progenitor which is identified by its ability to produce "mixed"colonies in single cell assays; the third type of progenitor is thought to be myoepithelial restricted progenitor because it only produces cells with myoepithelial features  <cit> . in this study, a part of normal cultured bmecs show a basal  markers  coinciding with the observation in human mecs  <cit> . however, bme65cs show a muc+/esa+ ck14- and no "mixed" population are found, which suggests bme65cs is not derived from myoepithelial cell or bipotent progenitor. although bme65cs maintains many characters of luminal cells with stable proliferation behaviour over the long period of culture, it is unclear whether bme65cs derived from a luminal epithelial lineage or from a progenitor cell with the capacity for luminal.

transcriptional analysis of multiple genes sheds light on the number of genes involved in the immortalisation of bme65cs cells. an interesting question raised by the data is the following: what are the main factors that contribute to initiation of the bme65cs cells immortalisation? there are two signaling pathways, p16ink4a-prb and p53-p <dig>  that are mainly responsible for the control of cellular senescence  <cit> . the tumor suppressor genes p16ink4a and p <dig> are frequently inactivated in cancer cells; inhibition of them escapes cellular senescence leading to tumorgenesis  <cit> . in this study, a significant change  of p16ink4a and p <dig> were found in bme65cs cells, suggesting that the inhibition of senescent-relevant pathways contributes to the bme65cs cell line immortalisation. additionally, the p16ink4a -prb pathway is thought to control the first growth barrier  of mecs  <cit> , and downregulation of p16ink4a is required for the tert-mediated immortalisation of mecs  <cit> . therefore, downregulation of p16ink4a is likely to be one of the key factors associating to bme65cs cells immortalisation. however, there is no evidence suggesting that inactivation or downregulation of p16ink4a alone can induce immortalisation of mecs. thus, changes in expression of other genes may also be involved in the initiation of bme65cs cells immortalisation. although the absence of p <dig> is thought to be an important initial factor for numbers of cancers, and several genes in the bcl- <dig> family are regulated by p <dig>  <cit> , it is unclear what the cause for the shortage of p <dig> expression  in bme65cs cells. it has been known that telomere shortening and dna damage activate p <dig> expression  <cit> . thus, the maintenance of telomere length in bme65cs cells may be the one reason for low expression level of p <dig>  there remains a discrepancy between the relationship of p <dig> and p16ink4a. in most cancer cells, p16ink4a and p <dig> are two-independent signalling pathways  <cit> . however, one report suggests that p16ink4a regulates p <dig> in human mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . despite this, the low expression of p <dig> might contribute to the coordination of bme65cs cells immortalisation, because p <dig> plays a role in transcriptional repression of tert  <cit> . together, we speculate that the low expression of both p16ink4a and p <dig> is important for the maintenance of bme65cs cells immortalisation.

overexpression of tert protects telomere repeats from erosion and, consequently, from induction of replicative senescence or apoptosis  <cit> . thus, expression of btert may be another important factor for immortalisation of bme65cs cells. tert is positively regulated by c-myc  <cit> , but negatively regulated by p <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the low expression of p <dig> and upregulation of c-myc in bme65cs cells might contribute to the activation of btert, and expression of btert may subsequently lead to stable telomere length in bme65cs cells, aiding cells in overcoming senescence and leading to immortalisation. as a transcriptional factor, c-myc is believed to regulate the expression of 15% of all genes, including genes involved in cell division, cell growth, and apoptosis  <cit> . in addition to the high expression in a number of cancer cells, c-myc is also expressed in stem cells, and is thought to be a requirement for the maintenance of stemness  <cit> . hence, we presume that the function pattern of cell linage-specific regulation of c-myc might be dependent on its expression level. curiously, the detection of trf length shows discontinuity in bme65cs. we suppose that it might be due to some non-immortal cells existing in bme65cs, since some bme65cs still died in each passage and showed sa-β-gal positive. it is interest to point out that the telomere length in bme65cs is similar to that in early passage bmecs, this suggests immortalisation event for bme65cs might occur in early passage cell.

in addition to c-myc, two other genes, trps- <dig> and bag- <dig>  are also highly expressed in mcf- <dig> cells but undetectable in bme65c cells. trps- <dig> is called tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndromes type  <dig> gene, which mutations are previously shown to be associated with three rare autosomal dominant genetic disorders known as the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndromes . recently, trps- <dig> protein has been found to be dramatically overexpressed in >90% of early and late-stage breast cancers  <cit> . bag- <dig> is a multifunctional protein that interacts with a wide range of cellular targets and regulates cell survival, signaling, metastasis, proliferation and transcription  <cit> . in breast cancer, overexpression of bag- <dig> has been detected in a majority of cases  <cit> . taken together, the expression of trps- <dig> and bag- <dig> may be used to evaluate malignant or non-malignant transformation of immortalised mecs. however, low expression of trps- <dig> was detected in senescent bmecs cells, implying that expression of trps- <dig> could be regulated by the cellular growth state, and trps- <dig> protein probably has other function that differs from its function in cancer cells.

bcl- <dig> and bax are important oncoproteins involved in regulation of cellular apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. bcl- <dig> functions in suppressing cell apoptosis, whereas bax promotes cell apoptosis  <cit> . paradoxically, expression of bcl- <dig> has been consistently associated with a better prognosis of breast cancer patients  <cit> . it has been suggested that the bax/bcl- <dig> ratio determines whether apoptosis will occur  <cit> . in this study, bax is deficient in bme65cs cells, whereas bcl- <dig> is highly expressed. hence, immortalisation of bme65cs cells is also accompanied by the inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. interestingly, expression of another member of the bcl- <dig> family, bag- <dig>  is undetectable in three different bovine mecs including bme65cs cells and excluding mcf- <dig> cells.

although we have analysed changes in expression of several genes from different cell strains, it is unclear what the initial mechanism is responsible for the change of these genes. based on the fact that both p16ink4a and p53-p <dig> are low expressed but not silenced in bme65cs cells, we propose that these two genes are not mutated during immortalisation. in addition, epigenetic control is another important mechanism in regulation of genes expression. abnormal dna methylation patterns have been shown in a number of cancer cells  <cit> . overexpression of dnmt <dig> has been detected in several human cancers  <cit> . carcinogenesis is often accompanied by increases of dnmt <dig> mrna, dnmt <dig> protein, and dna methyltransferase activity  <cit> . moreover, epigenetic change has been shown the important role in immortalisation of human mecs  <cit> . in this study, dnmt <dig> is significantly increased in bme65cs cells and highly expressed in mcf- <dig> cells, suggesting that dna methylation status is likely to be linked to immortalisation. whether the epigenetic changes conclusively lead to the altered expression of "immortalisation-initial genes" in bme65cs cells requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
during the spontaneous immortalisation of mammary epithelial cells, bme65cs cells undergo changes in gene expression. these changes improve cellular proliferation and may not contribute to malignant potential. the btert activation accompanied by the alternation of gene expression in multi-pathways contributes to bme65cs immortalisation. in addition, changes in expression of immortalisation-related genes are likely to be controlled by some mechanisms other than gene mutation, such as dna methylation. this study provides an insight into the relationship between cellular senescence and immortalisation. however, more research is required to provide a more detailed mechanism for the initiation of bme65cs cells immortalisation. regardless, this spontaneous immortal cell line will be a useful tool for studying cell molecular biology, in addition to the investigation of mammary gland specific expression and somatic gene targeting technology.
