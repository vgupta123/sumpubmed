BACKGROUND
phosphate <dig>  genes play diverse roles in plant growth and development; for example, some are important for inorganic phosphate  sensing and transport. arabidopsis thaliana athpho <dig> , the first species in which the pho <dig> gene family was identified, was reported to be key for long-distance transfer of pi from the root to the shoot  <cit> , as well as signal transduction of the long-distance pi-deficiency response  <cit> . athpho <dig> is predominantly expressed in root vascular tissues and is involved in root pi loading into the apoplastic space of the xylem vessels  <cit> . gene ectopic expression of athpho <dig> in leaves  <cit>  and in mesophyll protoplasts  <cit>  mediates cellular specific phosphate efflux. the arabidopsis genome encodes  <dig> additional genes  which are homologous to athpho <dig> <cit> . however, only athpho1; h <dig> complements athpho <dig> mutants when expressed under control of the athpho <dig> promoter, indicating that only these two members are involved in long-distance pi transport from root to shoots  <cit> . the rice genome has only three pho <dig> homologs  clustering with athpho <dig> and athpho1; h <dig>  but only osapho1; h <dig> complements athpho <dig> mutants, suggesting a role in phosphate homeostasis  <cit> .

seven pho1-like genes are present in the non-vascular land plant physcomitrella patens genome; however these gene functions are unclear  <cit> . in arabidopsis, some pho <dig> homologues are also expressed in non-vascular tissues such as hydathodes, trichomes, and pollen grains  <cit> . athpho1; h <dig> plays a role in the response of hypocotyls to blue light  <cit> , seed size and flowering  <cit> . athpho1; h <dig> was reported to be induced by numerous stresses, including local wounding responses  <cit> . recently, athpho <dig> has been suggested to play an important role in the stomatal response to abscisic acid ; its expression in guard cells is induced by aba treatment  <cit> . therefore, plant pho <dig> genes have undergone a functional diversification and acquired diverse roles beyond pi transport and homeostasis. furthermore, the pho <dig> homolog xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor  <dig>  in mammals functions as a receptor  <cit> ; and the suppressor of yeast gα protein deletion  protein is involved in the mating pheromone signal transduction pathway  <cit> . such functions suggest that pho <dig> genes have diversified over time.

soybean  is a crop of economic significance and a world-wide source of high quality protein and vegetable oils  <cit> . understanding mechanisms of nutrient homeostasis regulation, especially pi, may increase soybean yield. pho <dig> gene family molecular evolution and functional diversification remains understudied, so whether soybean pho <dig> genes are involved in pi sensing and transfer is unclear. to address this gap in the scientific literature, we experimentally characterized pho <dig> genes of g. max  in nannong1138- <dig> cultivars, and investigated their evolutionary patterns on a broad-scale phylogenetic framework. soybean is a diploidized ancient tetraploid species  <cit> , and gmapho <dig> genes might have distinct evolutionary patterns that differ from their orthologs in other plant species. gmapho <dig> genes may have unique expression patterns in response to various stimuli such as pi stress, contributing to plant diversification. our detailed gene expression analysis revealed that these genes may be important for plant organ development and responses to various abiotic stimuli.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the plant pho <dig> genes
phylogenetic analyses allow us to identify evolutionary conservation and divergence of genes. to understand the evolution of the plants pho <dig> gene family, we used athpho <dig> to query the ncbi and phytozome databases . we obtained  <dig> of pho1-like sequences from  <dig> plant species, including two chlorophyta species, one moss, one lycophyte, two gymnosperms, and  <dig> angiosperms. whole-genome sequences of most plant species are available, except for the two gymnosperms . currently,  <dig> chlorophyta genomes were released; however, only two pho <dig> genes were found in two species of ostreococcus lucimarinus and micromonas pusilla rcc <dig>  we observed that few homologs had evolved in yeast and animals; however, no pho1-like sequences were found in prokaryotes, suggesting that pho1-like genes originated in a common eukaryotic ancestor.

a maximum likelihood tree was generated using amino acid sequences of the deduced full-length peptides  with the best-fit evolutionary jtt  model . the wag  and lg  models were also tested , and resultant tree topologies were consistent with the jtt model; only a few gene relationships were varied within each class . proteins syg <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae, syg- <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans, and xpr <dig> in mus musculus and homo sapiens were used as out-groups in phylogenetic analyses. pho <dig> genes from algae formed the basal lineage, whereas pho1-like genes from land plants were monophyletic, apparently forming two major groups  based on the current tree topology, with a well-supported bootstrap value . one hundred twenty-five pho1-like genes from dicots were specifically assigned to class ia  with a basal lineage  containing  <dig> sequences from the basal land plants selaginella moellendorffii. in contrast,  <dig> members were present in class ii, which could be subdivided into class iia  and class iib  with basal grade  that was a non-monophyletic group including  <dig> selaginella genes and  <dig> physcomitrella genes. class iia and class iib consisted of the sequences from all seed plants with a 100% bootstrap value.

gene family copy number varied from  <dig> to  <dig> among the species, which was not correlated with the genome size  but slightly correlated with number of whole-genome duplication events  occurring within viridiplantae   <cit> . brassica rapa had the largest pho <dig> gene family  with a 500 mb genome size and  <dig> wgd events. brachypodium distachyon and zea mays had only  <dig> genes  with  <dig> and  <dig> wgd events occurring. class i contained  <dig> genes from  <dig> dicots and  <dig> genes from s. moellendorffii, while class ii had only  <dig> genes from all  <dig> land plants studied , indicating that the pho <dig> gene family asymmetrically evolved between class i and class ii.

to investigate pho <dig> gene family expansion and gene diversification, a gene tree was reconciled with the species tree. analyses revealed  <dig> duplications and  <dig> losses, with  <dig> of the d/l score . class i and ii diverged from ancestral duplications, and subclass class ia arose from at least two major duplication events. class iia  and class iib  arose from one duplication event occurring in seed plant ancestors, and each class could be divided further into angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages. class i genes in the dicots and s.moellendorffii were preserved and may have resulted from gene loss after the first duplication in other lineages. inspection of the physical chromosomal location of pho <dig> genes suggested that tandem duplication may have contributed to evolution of the class i pho <dig> gene family in the specific host. fifty-five of the class ia  <dig> members appeared on native host chromosomes as  <dig> to  <dig> gene tandem repeats .

gene structure variation throughout plant pho <dig> gene family
comparisons of  <dig> cdna sequences and genomic dna from  <dig> species revealed exons and introns number and position for each individual gene in land plants . six pho1-like transcripts from gymnosperms were not included; their gene sequences were unavailable. two pho <dig> gene sequences from green algae had no introns, and diverse gene structures in this family resulted from multiple intron losses and rare intron gains in land plants. intron numbers of these genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with widely divergent lengths. all genes in the class ii-basal grade had more than  <dig> introns, a characteristic that seemed to be maintained during seed plant evolution. around  <dig> % of class i members and  <dig> % of the genes in class iia and iib had more than  <dig> introns; genes from class iia had more than  <dig> introns, and  <dig> % of the pho <dig> genes within class iia had  <dig> introns.

to understand pho <dig> gene structures evolution, we reconstructed the ancestral states of exon patterns in  <dig> land plants excluding gymnosperms . data show that 14-exon structure of pho1genes could represent ancestral land plants structure. diverse structures of other members in the pho <dig> gene family could be traced back to the 14-exon structure, and their ancestral components could be clearly distinguished. given that all genes were  <dig> putative exons, exons from  <dig> to <dig> were highly conserved with respect to lengths and sequences within this family. these exons were observed to encode part of the spx  domain and the entirety of the exs  domain , domains which are characteristic of the pho <dig> protein family  <cit> . pho <dig> gene structure diversity apparently resulted from intron losses and novel intron gains after the origin of the 14-exon structure .

intron loss, as a major molecular event, happened twice at most in the consequent and adjacent exons in pho <dig> land plants genes evolution, whereas novel intron gain was unique to class iia. thus, the divergent patterns of intron number variations could be summarized into three types . type  <dig> included the exon-fusion events that happened once in adjacent exons; type  <dig> included exon-fusion events that occurred twice in the adjacent exons , while type  <dig> represented a novel intron gain event. among the  <dig> genes studied, the exon-fusion events occurred  <dig> times in pattern type  <dig>   <dig> times in pattern type  <dig> and  <dig> times in pattern type  <dig>  suggesting that intron loss was main molecular event occurring during evolution of this gene family. in pattern type  <dig>  we observed  <dig> exon-fusion events which were location dependent. such intron loss could occur multiple times  on one gene. pattern type  <dig> consisted of  <dig> events that were location-specific and could occur with type  <dig> pattern on one gene. intron gains  occurred  <dig> times in exon  <dig> only of class iia in  <dig> genes. we also assessed the intron phase for all pho <dig> genes . intron phases of adjacent exons were virtually conserved in these differently classed genes irrespective of how introns were lost or gained within the 14-exon structure.

genomic identification of the pho <dig> gene family in soybean
release of glycine max  draft soybean genome  <cit>  facilitated the isolation of gmapho <dig> genes in this investigation. data-mining using  <dig> arabidopsis pho <dig> homologs as queries revealed  <dig> putative pho <dig> homologous genes  in the soybean genome. gmapho1; h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> belong to class Ι; gmapho1; h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> are from class iia and gmapho1; h <dig> and h <dig> consist of class iib . these genes were found to be distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes , and the gene number on each chromosome varied widely, one gene on each chromosome of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 18; two on chromosome  <dig>  three on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> genes were localized to chromosome  <dig>  the number of introns varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . encoded proteins were predicted to contain the spx and exs domains , and were estimated to be located on plasma membranes. each gmapho <dig> protein contained at least  <dig> trans-membrane segments , suggesting the potential function of these proteins as transporters of phosphate absorbed from the soil. gmapho1-like proteins range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length and have 30-94% overall identities . interestingly, several pairs of gmapho1-like genes on different chromosomes showed high identities in protein sequences, for example, there was 94% identity between gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig>  93% between gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig> and 91% between gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig>  these data reflected genome duplication during the soybean evolution  <cit> . the open reading frame  sequence of these genes was confirmed by isolation of the cdna from soybean nanong1138- <dig>  gene-specific primers were designed according to the predicted sequences from soybean williams  <dig> . ultimately we obtained  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted cdna sequences, revealing  <dig> expressed functional pho1-like genes in the soybean genome. no transcription was observed for gmapho1; h <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig> on chromosome  <dig> in nannong1138- <dig> 

pm, plasma membrane; nuc, nuclear; vac, vacuolar membrane; er, endoplasmic reticulum. chra, location of gmapho <dig> genes on chromosomes. plb peptide length . slc, subcellular location of gmapho <dig> proteins. tmsd, number of transmembrane segments.

organ-specific expression of gmapho <dig> genes during soybean development
the expression of gmapho <dig> genes using real-time rt-pcr approach provided clues to their functional divergence. total rnas used in this study was taken from roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and developing fruits of soybean cultivar nannong1138- <dig> 

two-tailed student’s t-test of gene expression variation among these organs confirmed diverse expression patterns . here, we report difference in gene expression in plant organs compared with that in roots. under normal condition, most gmapho <dig> genes were constitutively expressed in different tissues, but several genes had tissue-specific or preferential expression patterns . in class Ι , gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig> were found to be expressed in all organs examined; however, they were significantly abundant in flowers and fruits . gmapho1; h <dig> was significantly down-regulated while gmapho1; h <dig> was significantly up-regulated during fruit development . gmapho1; h <dig> was predominantly expressed in flowers and leaves  and was moderately expressed in roots and earlier fruit developments with low expression in stems and 7-day fruits after pollination . the expression level of gmapho1; h <dig> was found to be significantly higher in most organs and maintained a higher level during fruit development, but undetectable in roots  . gmapho1; h9/h <dig> were expressed in most tissues; however, their expression levels were found to be much higher in roots and leaves  and extremely lower in stems and 7-day fruits . notably, these genes were observed to be gradually repressed during fruit development . however, genes in class ii had limited organ expression patterns with clear difference between class iia and class iib . genes in class iia were predominantly expressed in roots; however, they were expressed to a lesser degree in flowers and were not expressed in leaves and developing fruits . gmapho1; h1/h <dig> had an equivalent expression in stems and roots, while gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig> were less expressed in stems . gmapho1; h12/h <dig> in class iib were constitutively expressed, and predominantly so in mature flowers  . these findings suggest that gmapho <dig> genes may exert certain roles in soybean development with lineage-specific divergent patterns.

gene expression in response to various stresses in soybean
examination of soybean pho <dig> genes transcription in roots challenged with osmotic, salt stress, and pi stresses in the 3-week old seedlings  identified genes that respond to abiotic stresses. total rna from roots was subjected to real-time rt-pcr for gmapho1genes . relative to untreated controls , class i genes had different responses to osmotic stress , while the genes in class ii responded similarly to osmotic stress . in class i, gmapho1; h <dig> was rapidly and constantly repressed  , and gmapho1; h9/h <dig> were induced by osmotic stresses  . the genes gmapho1; h <dig> or gmapho1; h <dig> were slightly influenced by osmotic treatments  . class iia genes were repressed by osmotic stresses  . under salt stresses, all class Ι genes were induced to express  . in class iia, genes were moderately changed under the influence of salt stress . in contrast, gmapho1; h12/h <dig> in class iib were strongly induced under salt stress conditions ; their expression increased more than  <dig> times compared with controls . the two types of pi stress treatments altered gmpho <dig> gene transcription significantly at most treatment time-points ; however, each gene had complex but similar pattern under the pi stress treatments, suggesting that gmpho <dig> genes have an complex response to pi alteration around the roots. thus, these genes have different roles in response to salt, osmotic and pi stresses.

discussion
limited functional characterization of the pho <dig> gene family suggests it has important roles in plant developmental and physiological processes  <cit> . here we report our investigations into the phylogeny and structural evolution of pho1-like genes in plants and share data about their functional divergence. our data were confirmed with comprehensive expression analyses of these genes in soybean.

evolution of the pho <dig> gene family during evolution of plants
our results revealed that pho <dig> homologs were prevalent in eukaryotes only. unlike previous reports  <cit> , we identified two pho1-like cdnas in two of the six released genomes of chlorophyta, indicating that the gene is not required for all unicellular green algae. however, pho1-like genes were expanded tremendously in multicellular plants . phylogenetic reconstruction with an 87% bootstrap value revealed that these genes formed two major classes in land plants , indicating that the pho1-like genes from all land plants share a common ancestor; the two classes are sister groups. the topology of the pho <dig> gene family of land plants might have originated through several duplications, followed by gene loss in some descendants. genes in class i, occupying  <dig> %  of the total identified genes, were from  <dig> dicots and one lycophyte, while  <dig> members from land plants were present in class ii . one duplication event led to the division of class ii into class iia and class iib of the genes in seed plants, while multiple duplication events including tandem duplications in dicots that specifically occurred in class i led to its expansion. these data indicated that lineage-specific expansion and divergence events of the pho1-like genes occurred in seed plants.

gene duplication is a permanent and continual factor contributing to the complexity of genetic material  <cit> . gene copy variation, a result of gene duplication and gene loss, was prominent in the pho <dig> gene family. the gene family also evolved in yeast, animals and green algae with a single copy, while copy numbers of these genes in land plants varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  the variable copy numbers are not consistent with the genome sizes of different species, evidence for which was obtained from an early vascular plant with a small genome . there are  <dig> copies of pho <dig> genes in s.moellendorffii, whereas in z.mays  only  <dig> copies survived. however, gene family expansion slightly correlates to the whole-genome duplication and triplication events which occurred among viridiplantae  <cit> , indicating an important role of gene losses during pho <dig> gene family evolution. monocots were found to possess lesser pho1-like genes compared to dicots and basal land plants, like p.patens and s.moellendorffii. there are  <dig> members in  <dig> dicots compared to  <dig> members in  <dig> monocots ; thus, gene loss events are key to monocots evolution. these results imply that the expansion of the pho <dig> gene family may be associated with the origin of diversification of land plants.

a genome-wide study compared orthologous groups of genes in  <dig> model genomes  and revealed that genes related to intracellular components, regulation of metabolism, hormone metabolism, transcriptional regulation, cell communication, and responses to hormone stimuli are more likely to have undergone non-tandem duplication. in contrast, genes involved in stress responses had an increased probability of being retained in a single-lineage fashion after tandem duplication, suggesting that tandem duplicates are probably important for adaptations to rapidly changing environments  <cit> . interestingly, we found that almost 50% of class Ιa genes  underwent tandem duplication. however, found no tandem repeats in class ii. pho1-like genes in class ii have been functionally characterized in arabidopsis and rice  <cit>  and are known to play major roles in root-to-shoot transfer of phosphate, while class Ι genes are important in biotic and/or abiotic stress responses  <cit> . tandem gene arrangements and copy number variation of pho <dig> class Ιa genes may arise from a response to different environmental selections during evolution. this assumption was further supported by our expression analyses in soybeans.

the majority of conserved introns remain unchanged over time  <cit> . thus, intron/exon changes could provide clues on evolutionary relationships  <cit> . the intronless pho <dig> genes originated from a eukaryotic ancestor, evidence for which is provided by the structure of unicellular yeast and green algae . once multicellular organisms  appeared, pho <dig> genes became more complicated. introns can probably be gradually acquired, or obtained once during the evolution of the multicellular organisms from the unicellular ancestors. our gene structure reconstruction and exon-intron analysis with all available sequences revealed that the gene structure with  <dig> introns might be an original organization in land plants, and that pho <dig> genes might have evolved along with multicellular organisms . we therefore proposed that the intron loss is a major event in the evolution of pho <dig> genes of land plants. most class i members had fewer introns than their ancestors, due to intron loss accompanying the exon-fusion event. this event occurred less frequently in class iia and class iib members, therefore, most of them contained  <dig> or  <dig> introns and the 14-intron structure arose from an additional novel intron gain , which only occurred in class iia. also, intron losses occurred independently, resulting in 12– <dig> introns. consistent with the previous observation that intron phase change is rare  <cit> , intron phases of adjacent exons were found to be almost conserved in pho <dig> genes in different classes.

furthermore, we found that  <dig> of  <dig> genes lost their first intron in class i. plant studies offer evidence of intron effects on gene expression  <cit> . the first intron of arabidopsis histone h <dig> gene, petunia actin-depolymerizing factor  <dig>  and maize shrunken- <dig>  can alter gene expression levels  <cit> . introns are also involved in the regulation of spatial and temporal gene expression patterns, such as photosystem i subunit ii , agamous  and flowering locus c   <cit> . in the dicot-specific class ia, almost all genes lost their first introns. indeed, the arabidopsis class i pho <dig> genes have a boarder expression domain than class ii genes  <cit> . our data support these finding: expression domains of the soybean genes in class i are more diverse than those in class ii.

functional diversification of the pho <dig> gene family in soybean
we surveyed the genome draft of soybean williams  <dig> and predicted  <dig> pho1-like genes. they were found to be either tandemly or segmentally located on the chromosomes. we characterized the cdna sequences from the nannong1138- <dig> cultivars to validate  <dig> of the predicted sequences. these genes on the phylogenetic tree were classified into the class i and class ii, suggesting their functional divergence in developmental processes and in response to abiotic stresses.

transcripts of the predicated two genes  in class ia were not detected in nannong 1138– <dig>  indicating that either these genes were silenced or had extremely low levels. the expression profiles of soybean pho1-like genes provided clues to their functional relevance and divergence. we found that the genes in the two classes were expressed with different tissue-specific patterns, while the genes in the same class showed a similar expression pattern. the genes in class i had a broader expression domain than those in class ii and they were developmentally regulated during fruit development in soybean. these results are corroborated by previous studies on athpho1; h <dig> in class i that plays a role in the response of hypocotyls to blue light  <cit> , as well as seed size and flowering  <cit> . the genes in class iib were expressed in all tissues examined, while the genes in class iia seemed to be restricted to roots, stems and flowers. these findings, therefore, support a lineage-specific functional differentiation related to soybean plant and fruit development.

the phylogenetic analysis showed that gmapho1; h <dig>  gmapho1; h <dig>  gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h <dig> are grouped with athpho <dig> and osapho1; h <dig> that play important roles in pi transference  <cit> , hinting that these genes might have related functions. these genes indeed showed a similar tissue-specific expression pattern with little variation. most gmapho <dig> genes were expressed in roots and responded to pi deficient or sufficient treatments in complex manners. surprisingly, each gene in the different pi stresses had a similar responding mode in most treated-time points. this is not well understood yet. nonetheless, our observations suggest that they might function in pi sensing or transporting in soybean as their homologs athpho <dig> in arabidopsis and osapho1; h <dig> in rice  <cit> .

athpho1; h <dig> in arabidopsis is activated by a diversity of stimuli including salinity, osmotic, pathogens and even by wounding  <cit> , thus suggesting that some pho1-like genes might be involved in these physiological processes. gmapho <dig> genes exhibited varied expression patterns under abiotic stresses. the genes, gmapho1; h <dig> in class ia, gmapho1; h1/h <dig>  gmapho1; h <dig>  gmapho1; h <dig> and gmapho1; h12/h <dig> in class iia were rapidly and constantly inhibited by osmotic stress, while all genes in class ia and gmapho1; h12/h <dig> in class iib were found to be strongly induced by salt stress, suggesting that they are likely associated with the processes that respond to these stresses. inspection of chromosomal localization of pho <dig> gens in soybean and other species genomes suggests that almost 50% of the genes in class ia are arranged tandemly on the chromosomes. our study combined with the evidences from arabidopsis supports the deduction that tandem duplication and variation in copy number of pho <dig> gene in class Ιa might result from a response to different environmental selection during evolution. during evolution, modulating gene expression and increasing gene numbers possibly allows the different pho1genes to act synergistically to promote plant development and to reinforce tolerance to environment stresses. these genes can greatly contribute to plant adaptation and survival in adverse conditions through offsetting the effects of mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
using comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses we identified two major classes  of the pho <dig> gene family in land plants. class i genes were expanded in dicotyledonous plants and selaginella moellendorffii, while class ii genes were found in all land plants. class ia subfamily gene expansion in dicots and the loss of the subfamily genes in monocots were also documented. intron loss was found to be an active force in the evolution of gene structure since the origin of a complicated structure  in multicellular plants. the functional divergences among pho <dig> genes in soybean suggested that significant subclass-specific functional evolution took place after their phylogenetic diversification. our results suggest that the expansion and sequence variation accompanying dramatic functional diversifications of the plant pho <dig> gene family are associated with the origin of diversification of land plants. our findings provided valuable information and new insights into the molecular and functional evolutionary pattern of the plant gene family during evolution of plants. evaluating the function of this gene family could provide valuable insights into their involvement in metabolic and biochemical processes.
