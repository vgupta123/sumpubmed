BACKGROUND
m. avium subsp. paratuberculosis , of the m. avium complex , is one of the slowest growing mycobacteria and like other pathogenic mycobacteria, is difficult to detect and treat. it is widely recognised as the cause of johne’s disease, a gastrointestinal disease of livestock, and is also implicated in human crohn’s disease . the mac contain subspecies that infect animals and subspecies pathogenic to humans  <cit> . the closely related mac display slight genomic differences depending on their host and comparison of these differences has the potential to identify host specific pathogenicity factors, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment.

in the current study we compared the genome of a newly isolated strain of m. paratuberculosis  from a female patient with ulcerative colitis  <cit> , to other pathogenic mycobacteria using single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis, blastp  and phmmer  algorithms. while m. paratuberculosis normally infects animals, its isolation from humans is rare, with less than  <dig> isolates reported in the last 20 years . like other m. paratuberculosis from humans, m. paratuberculosis  <dig> is cattle type   <cit> . therefore, further analysis of this strain provides a unique opportunity to explore other possible variations in host pathogenicity factors.

while genomic studies have compared a number of these isolates to other m. paratuberculosis strains and m. hominissuis , all sequences of m. paratuberculosis to date have been obtained from laboratory strains of unknown subculture number, and often have undergone many years of laboratory passage. current evidence would suggest that multiple subculture of m. tuberculosis may affect virulence properties with, for example, marked changes in cell wall lipids observed after extensive laboratory passage  <cit> . important to note is that m. bovis bcg, widely used in vaccines due to its attenuation in immunocompetent hosts, was produced by multiple subculture in vitro  <cit> . in contrast, the genome of m. paratuberculosis  <dig> was sequenced after only four subcultures and therefore provides a more accurate representation of the wild-type in vivo mycobacterial genome.

the virulence factors explored in this study, the pe/ppe  genes, mammalian cell entry  operons and the mycobactin cluster, were chosen based on studies into m. tuberculosis and m. avium pathogenicity. the analysis of these genomic loci afford the representation of pathogenicity elements present in m. tuberculosis isolated from human infections and m. paratuberculosis isolated from livestock infections .

the pe/ppe families are unique to mycobacteria and were first identified for their ability to stimulate ifn-γ  <cit> . they are gc rich and thought to be the main source of strain variability within the mac  <cit> . pe and ppe refer to the residues, proline-glutamate and proline-proline-glutamate, respectively, located at the n termini of their encoded proteins. the m. tuberculosis genome devotes 10 % of its protein coding potential to this protein family with various functions attributed to them  <cit> . similar to m. tuberculosis, some ppe of m. paratuberculosis are expressed on the cell surface, while others are cell wall associated and interact with the immune system via tlr- <dig>  <cit> , however, this gene family only represents  <dig>  % of the m. paratuberculosis genome  <cit> .

the mammalian cell entry  operons of m. tuberculosis were first discovered in studies to elucidate how m. tuberculosis enters non-phagocytic cells  <cit> . the genes exist in many bacterial species, however, only in the mycobacteria do they exist as operons  <cit> . the function of these operons is now thought to be diverse and not confined to cell entry, given that they have been found in non-pathogenic, environmental mycobacteria  <cit> . there are four mce operons in m. tuberculosis, each has two yrbe genes and six mce genes, often coupled to a mce regulator gene. the genes in each operon are contiguous but differentially expressed, depending on growth conditions and/or nutrient supply  <cit> . in the mac, additional mce operons have been reported that do not appear to have orthologues in m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

mycobactin dependency in vitro is a major phenotypic difference between m. paratuberculosis and other subspecies of the mac complex. mycobactins are siderophores that transport or scavenge iron, particularly in environments where free iron is limited, such as inside a host cell  <cit> . like other siderophores, mycobactin is a secondary metabolite, a product of non-ribosomal peptide synthases  and polyketide synthases    <cit> . the mycobactin gene cluster contains  <dig> genes  and the mycobactin operon promoter is active in m. paratuberculosis, with all mycobactin genes able to be transcribed inside bovine macrophages  <cit> . m. paratuberculosis  <dig> has a peculiar mycobactin phenotype as it grows on some types of media, such as middlebrook 7h <dig>  without the addition of mycobactin  <cit> . given this, comparison of m. paratuberculosis  <dig> with other mac strains has the potential to provide unique genomic information and the basis for their pathogenicity.

RESULTS
the general features of the assembled draft genome of m. paratuberculosis  <dig> are presented in table  <dig>  out of a total of  <dig> protein coding sequences ,  <dig>  belonged to recognised subsystems. of the  <dig> non-hypothetical cds,  <dig> belonged to recognised subsystems while  <dig> cds were hypothetical and of these,  <dig> belonged to subsystems according to rast.table  <dig> chromosome features of m. paratuberculosis 43525



comparative blastp searches and clustering analyses executed through proteinortho  <cit> , suggested that  <dig> putative protein sequences annotated in the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> genome were unique to this strain . these putatively unique sequences included a large number of hypothetical proteins, as well as pe-pgrs and mce genes that will be described below. in addition, differences were observed between the genes encoding the mycobactin cluster and this cluster was analysed in more detail.

single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis
to better characterise m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  variation between this bacterium and  <dig> other mycobacterial strains  were compared at the nucleotide level. of these strains, nine were m. paratuberculosis isolates from humans, one was an ovine isolate and one was a caprine isolate. the snps of all strains were concatenated and used for phylogenetic analysis on a genome-wide level with m. paratuberculosis k <dig> as the reference strain. the rooted tree  shows m. paratuberculosis  <dig> to be closely related to m. paratuberculosis clij <dig>  a bovine isolate from victoria, australia  <cit> .fig.  <dig> graphical representation of the  <dig> orthologous clusters of annotated protein sequences encoded in  <dig> mycobacterial strains. comparative blastp  <dig> .22+ searches  <cit>  were conducted using proteinortho  <cit>  and orthologous clusters were visualised using fripan

pe/ppe genes
the nomenclature of the mac complex pe/ppe genes was used as previously described  <cit> , and a summary of the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> genes shared between the mac and m. tuberculosis is presented in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  thirty seven ppe genes were found in m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  none of which were unique to this strain, while  <dig> were conserved in all strains examined. in the bovine strain m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  macppe <dig> is a fragmented pseudogene, whereas the full gene is present in the human isolate m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  and this gene is homologous to mav <dig> from m. avium  <dig>  although macppe <dig> and macppe <dig> are said to be unique to the m. paratuberculosis subspecies, here only macppe <dig> was found in m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a summary of the presence and absence of the macpe/ppe. the genes were sorted according to their distribution profiles . orthologues in m. tuberculosis were also added for comparison. blue indicates the gene  is present while yellow indicates the gene is missing. the strain order across the top is determined by the relative presence/absence of pe/ppe genes



ten pe genes and one pe fragment were present in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> . pe <dig> was the only pe gene that was not conserved in all strains studied, being found only in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and m. avium  <dig>  the genome of m. paratuberculosis  <dig> also had gene pe_pgrs <dig> which was also found in m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  m. tuberculosis and m. avium  <dig>  but absent in m. avium atcc <dig> 

mycobactin
a total of  <dig> nrps/ pks clusters were identified by antismash in the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> genome. the cluster identified as the mycobactin cluster was analysed and found to have a different primary structure as compared with that of other mac strains, with respect to the spacing of genes and gene size . the mycobactin cluster of m. paratuberculosis has previously been shown to have both nrps and pks modules  <cit> . while the mbta, mbtc, mbtd, mbtg and mbti genes of the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> mycobactin cluster were found to be identical to the equivalent genes in m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  the remaining  <dig> genes  were found to encode larger proteins.fig.  <dig> comparison of the mycobactin cluster between members of the mac complex and m. tuberculosis. amino acid length is indicated above each gene, gene names are indicated and colour matched to equivalent genes in other strains . m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  m. paratuberculosis s <dig> and m. avium atcc <dig> are of animal origin, the remaining three are from human hosts. the nrps modules mbtb and mbte are one gene in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and m. tuberculosis but two genes in other mac. in addition, all m. paratuberculosis strains had an mce operon  present in the gap between mbta and mbtj 



furthermore, the mbtb gene, shown by others to be the first gene involved in mycobactin synthesis  <cit> , encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids in m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  which was larger than the mbtb gene product of strains such as m. paratuberculosis k <dig> and m. avium  <dig> but similar in size to the equivalent mbtb in m. tuberculosis. the polypeptide size difference between these strains was due to the thioesterase domain of mbtb being encoded on a separate gene in m. paratuberculosis k <dig> and other mac, but not in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> or m. tuberculosis .

the size and organisation of genes encoding mbte vary greatly across strains . the amp binding and peptidyl carrier protein  domains were encoded on the one mbte gene in m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  however, in m. paratuberculosis k <dig> the amp binding was split across map2172c and map2173c, while the pcp domain is encoded on map2172c. confirmation by amplicon sequencing demonstrated a  <dig> nucleotide indel in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> compared to m. paratuberculosis k <dig> . the amp binding domain is a  <dig> aa protein in m. paratuberculosis k <dig> as compared with a  <dig> residue protein in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and a  <dig> aa protein in m. avium  <dig>  anti-smash uses a number of databases to predict the substrate for each nrps domain. the predicted substrate for mbte of m. paratuberculosis  <dig> is tyrosine. in contrast, there was no consensus on the predicted substrate for mbte of m. paratuberculosis k <dig> and m. avium  <dig> 

the mbtf gene in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> encoded a longer protein than in the m. paratuberculosis k <dig> equivalent. the main difference was in the epimerisation domain that encodes a shorter polypeptide in m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  as compared with m. paratuberculosis  <dig> , m. avium  <dig> , m. avium atcc <dig>  and m. tuberculosis .

five copies of mbth were found in m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  four of which  had 100 % sequence similarity with the equivalent genes in m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  the mbth_ <dig> gene was situated adjacent to the mycobactin cluster. however, the fifth mbth gene of m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  adjacent to psta was found to have an 85 % match to mbth_ <dig> in k <dig> but 100 % sequence similarity with  <dig> other mbth like genes including the d522_ <dig> gene in another m. paratuberculosis strain  originally isolated from a goat, map4_ <dig> from m. paratuberculosis map <dig> , mah_ <dig> of m. avium th <dig> and gene ocq_ <dig> in m. intracellulare .

in addition to differences in the size of genes within the mycobactin gene cluster, there were also differences in the spacing between the genes and gene clusters. the gap between mbta and mbtj  was comparable between m. paratuberculosis k <dig> and m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and contained a mce operon  <dig>  kbp downstream from mbta. however, the gap between mbtj  and mbti  in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> was 2 kb shorter compared with the  <dig>  kb spacer region in m. paratuberculosis k <dig> .

mce genes
the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> genome contained eight mce operons that encode  <dig> mce proteins, although not all are complete. the four best known mce operons identified in m. tuberculosis are labelled 1– <dig> in table  <dig>  other identified mce operons include mce  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  based on these findings it is suggested to include the gene designation mce  <dig>  an operon that was originally described as a duplicate of mce  <dig>  however, mce  <dig> has low nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity , when compared to the existing mce <dig> in m. paratuberculosis  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the amino acid sequence similarity of the mce genes in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> compared to equivalent genes in related bacteria of the mac and m. tuberculosis. of particular note is that in all m. paratuberculosis isolates included in this study, mce <dig> was found  <dig>  kb downstream from mbta of the mycobactin cluster.table  <dig> percentage amino acid sequence similarity of mce operons in  <dig> compared to m. paratuberculosis k <dig> , m. avium  <dig>  m. avium th <dig>  m. intracellulare and m. tuberculosis

four genes of the mce <dig> operon were longer than the corresponding genes in m. paratuberculosis k <dig> and the same size as the corresponding genes of m. paratuberculosis map <dig> and other mac. while the mce <dig> operon was conserved among m. paratuberculosis, m. avium strains  <dig> and th <dig>  the mce3r gene appeared to be missing from m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and other m. paratuberculosis strains. as reported by others, the mce4a gene was highly conserved across all mycobacteria  <cit> .

of particular note was the finding that the conserved hypothetical integral membrane protein yrbe3b was present in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> but missing in m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  interestingly, yrbe3b has been found in a m. paratuberculosis strain  isolated from sheep, m. avium  <dig>  m. avium th <dig>  m. avium atcc <dig>  m. intracellulare and m. tuberculosis.

discussion
using comparative genomics a rare human isolate of m. paratuberculosis was compared to both animal and human pathogens of the mac and m. tuberculosis. after broad analysis by blast and snp typing, this study focused on comparisons of pe/ppe genes, the mycobactin cluster and the mce operons, all of which are key virulence factors across the species examined.

when compared at the nucleotide level, m. paratuberculosis  <dig> displayed a close relationship to a bovine isolate m. paratuberculosis clij <dig> . this requires further investigation, particularly as m. paratuberculosis is shed in the milk of infected cows even at the early subclinical stage and that m. paratuberculosis can survive pasteurisation  <cit> .

as in prior work, it was found that the complement of ppe genes was variable across strains while the pe genes showed a high degree of conservation   <cit> . a possible human associated ppe, macppe <dig> was present in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and m. intracellulare, which was orthologous to rv3621c . in contrast, macppe <dig> was not present in any strains of animal origin, including other m. paratuberculosis isolates. in m. tuberculosis, this gene was not essential for in vitro growth but could be detected in m. tuberculosis h37rv infected guinea pig lungs at  <dig> and 90 days post infection suggesting a critical function for this gene product in vivo  <cit> . pe_pgrs <dig> was also found to be present in strains isolated from humans, as well as m. paratuberculosis k <dig> although its function too is unknown. two pe/ppe genes, macppe <dig> and a mav <dig> orthologue, were only found in the new human isolate m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  m. hominissuis and a caprine isolate of m. paratuberculosis, s <dig>  given the significance of the pe/ppe family to virulence, through generation of antigenic variations, the functions of the pe/ppe identified here should be investigated further.

macppe <dig> is unique to m. paratuberculosis and is located on a large sequence polymorphism - <dig>  <cit> . there is some evidence that lsps are associated with the cellular immune response  <cit>  and it is co-transcribed with the iron-regulated transporters  a and b equivalents map3734- <dig> in macrophages  <cit> . irta and b are thought to be involved in the trafficking of carboxymycobactin, which is secreted in contrast to cell wall associated mycobactin  <cit> . as proposed in a recent study, macppe <dig> may act as a signal transduction protein for the irta and b equivalents which in turn form a single abc transporter for fe-carboxymycobactin and iron assimilation via ferric iron reduction  <cit> . structural studies demonstrating the similarity of m. tuberculosis ppe proteins to signal transduction molecules and the observation that some pe/ppe proteins are up-regulated during iron limitation and repressed by the regulator ider, form the basis of the above proposal  <cit> . in addition, the finding that m. tuberculosis mbtb mutants that are unable to synthesise mycobactin or carboxymycobactin, but have irtab intact, can grow in the presence of exogenous fe-carboxymycobactin  <cit> , may explain how mycobactin dependent strains of m. paratuberculosis survive the hostile environment of the macrophage as well as the mycobactin independence of other strains in vitro   <cit> . an attenuated strain of m. paratuberculosis  has lost two of the irta and b orthologues  as part of the large variable genomic island- <dig> deletion  <cit> . this strain was used in early vaccine preparations and was extensively subcultured before attenuation on dubos media with pyruvate  <cit> . m. paratuberculosis is usually maintained on media containing ferric ammonium citrate rather than pyruvate, as the two are antagonistic once mycobactin is added  <cit> . macppe <dig> was not part of the vgi- <dig> deletion in the attenuated strain.

m. paratuberculosis  <dig> did not require additional mycobactin on middlebrook agar, a phenotype that has been described before in m. paratuberculosis isolates from sheep  <cit> . therefore the mycobactin cluster required closer scrutiny and was found to differ in its primary structure when compared to m. paratuberculosis k <dig> 

the three nrps domains of the mycobactin cluster were larger in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> as compared to m. paratuberculosis k <dig> and encode larger proteins. the size of the mbte gene varies greatly across strains mainly because the amp binding domain is smaller in m. paratuberculosis k <dig> as compared to equivalent domains in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and m. avium  <dig>  the increase in product size results in a predicted substrate of tyrosine for this domain, while there is no prediction consensus for the equivalent substrate in m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  like mbtb, the mbte gene has been shown to be crucial in the biosynthesis of both mycobactin and carboxymycobactin, with disruption of this gene in m. tuberculosis resulting in the loss of mycobactin and carboxymycobactin production and a drastically reduced ability to grow on agar  <cit> . however, unlike the mbtb mutant, the mbte mutant of m. tuberculosis is unable to grow on iron replete media  <cit> . given that iron availability in an infected macrophage is thought to fluctuate  <cit> , mutations in mbte resulting in the loss of mycobactin and carboxymycobactin production would likely hamper the ability of the pathogen to adapt and persist in this environment.

while other nrps domains were larger in the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> mycobactin cluster, none of these resulted in different substrate predictions. currently there is no complete consensus on the substrate for the equivalent mbte gene in m. tuberculosis, although a recent study has obtained the soluble megasynthase components  by co-producing them with mbth  <cit> . although the growth requirements of m. paratuberculosis  <dig> suggest that it does produce a functional mycobactin, a similar functional study is needed to confirm this hypothesis as well as determine the structure of the isolate m. paratuberculosis  <dig> mycobactin and whether this differs to mycobactins produced by other m. paratuberculosis strains.

m. paratuberculosis  <dig> did, however, have an additional mbth gene compared to m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  with orthologues of this gene present in  <dig> other mycobacterial strains, and all with 100 % amino acid sequence homology. the mbth proteins are thought to play a vital role in mycobactin precursor biosynthesis  <cit> . in vitro, the activity of nrps adenylating enzymes is stimulated by the addition of mbth and further they have been shown to act as activators and/or chaperones in the nrps assembly line  <cit> . this may explain the different mycobactin phenotype apparent in m. paratuberculosis  <dig> given that several mbth-like genes can functionally replace each other  <cit> .

a surprising link between the mycobactin cluster and the mce operons was observed in this study. a mce operon  exists  <dig>  kbp downstream from mbta and upstream of mbtj and mbti. the mce are thought to be involved in transport particularly under nutrient deplete conditions and each operon can be expressed at different stages of the growth cycle in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . the mce also have high amino acid homology with abc transport permeases which exist  <dig> kbp downstream of the m. tuberculosis mycobactin cluster  <cit> . the significance of the close proximity of this operon to the mycobactin cluster is currently unknown, however, further work to determine if this operon is co-transcribed with the mycobactin cluster is currently underway.

also of note, mce3r was missing from m. paratuberculosis  <dig> and other m. paratuberculosis genomes, a finding that may explain why the mce <dig> operon appears to be non-functional in this subspecies. mce3r belongs to the tetr family and controls the expression of genes involved in β-oxidation and lipid metabolism in m. tuberculosis in vitro  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, mce <dig> mutants have been shown to grow slower than in the wild-type, thus providing a possible explanation for the longer doubling time of m. paratuberculosis  <cit> .

m. paratuberculosis  <dig>  along with sheep strains of m. paratuberculosis, m. avium  <dig>  m. avium th <dig>  m. avium atcc <dig> and m. intracellulare, was found to have the yrbe3b orthologue, unlike m. paratuberculosis k <dig>  the function of yrbe3b is largely unknown but it is thought to be the permease component of an abc-type transport system involved in resistance to organic solvents  <cit> . as yet the individual functions of the mce <dig> genes have not been determined due to the fact that generating mutants for the genes in question has been extremely difficult  <cit> . the variable gene composition of the mce <dig> operon between mac strains may allow further studies to be performed to elucidate these functions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated human specific virulence genes of the mycobacteria and explored differences in the pe/ppe, mce and mycobactin cluster present in animal and human isolates of the mac complex. although m. paratuberculosis has long been thought of as the poor cousin when it comes to scavenging iron, the current study has shown for the first time the presence of unique ppe and mce genes that are possibly involved in both mycobactin and carboxymycobactin synthesis. strains exist that appear to have only one mechanism of sequestering iron and m. paratuberculosis strains that display differing phenotypes form the basis of future functional studies designed to elucidate how pathogenic mycobacteria survive for long periods inside the host cells.

given that the m. paratuberculosis  <dig> genome is now publicly available, investigation of a range of other virulence factors present in the mycobacteria, including mmp, the esx secretion pathway and the fatty acid synthesis genes can be undertaken which would shed further light on the ability of specific mycobacterial strains to colonise and cause disease in different tissues of different hosts.
