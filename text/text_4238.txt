BACKGROUND
frequency discrimination is the ability of a listener to discriminate between two pure tones that differ only in frequency. frequency discrimination in fishes has been established from pyschophysical studies of a limited number of species  <cit> , but has been of great theoretical interest since the early fish hearing experiments of von frisch  <cit> . the reason for this interest is that the otolith organs of fishes lack obvious macromechanical frequency selective processes such as those found in the basilar membrane of the mammalian cochlea  <cit> . thus, it is unclear exactly how fish are able to distinguish between frequencies.

indeed, the basis of frequency discrimination in general has been debated for well over a century. the two main models of frequency discrimination are the place theory and temporal theory of hearing. the complex history of these theories is reviewed elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, the place theory states that the perception of pitch depends upon the location of vibrations along the sensory epithelia . the temporal theory argues that the perception of pitch depends upon the temporal patterns with which auditory neurons respond to sound, since waveforms of stimuli are well represented by patterns of phase-locking in the auditory nerve  <cit> . in reality, both place and temporal cues may be processed differentially at various levels of the auditory system as the information passes from the sensory epithelia of the ear to the auditory nuclei of the brainstem, and on to the mid- and forebrain. it is currently unknown whether frequency discrimination in fishes is largely due to peripheral processes  or central processes .

many vertebrate auditory systems have been shown to exhibit tonotopic mapping, which is an orderly arrangement of frequency response in the sensory organ. for example, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are known to use tonotopic mapping to peripherally discriminate frequencies  <cit> . that is, sensitivity to specific frequencies varies across the length of the auditory sensory epithelia. for example, frequency response in the mammalian cochlea and the avian cochlea and basilar papilla is organized in a graduated manner, with highest discernable frequencies stimulating hair cells in the basal end, lowest frequencies stimulating the apical end, and intermediate frequencies stimulating hair cells in a graded manner in between the two extremes  <cit> . frogs have a three-part auditory system which includes a low-frequency vibration/sound detector , a low- to mid-frequency sound detector and discriminator , and a high-frequency sound detector . tonotopy in the ears allows at least some frequency analysis to take place peripherally, outside of the central nervous system. although tonotopic mapping has been well demonstrated in mammals, birds, and frogs, it has not been adequately investigated in fishes.

fishes hear using an ear that is similar in many aspects to the inner ear of other vertebrates, and have similar capabilities in performing auditory functions such as discriminating between sounds of varying intensity, frequency, and temporal patterns as other vertebrates  <cit> . indeed, there is good evidence that the ears of terrestrial vertebrates evolved from the ears of fishes  <cit> . the fish ear has three semicircular canals that respond to movement of the head and three sensory organs, the saccule, lagena, and utricle. one or more of these end organs serves as a sound detector, depending upon the species  <cit> . each ear organ has a macula of sensory hair cells that are similar to those found in the ears of all other vertebrates.

exposure to loud sounds can damage or destroy macular hair cells and induce hearing threshold shifts in fishes  <cit> . sound exposure followed by examination of the inner ear has been used to ascertain which regions of the inner ear are sensitive to particular frequencies in birds and mammals  <cit> . for example, in chicks  exposed to tones, higher frequencies produced a loss of short hair cells in the basal region of the basilar papillae, while lower frequencies produced a broader region of hair cell loss in the apical region  <cit> . similarly, mammals exposed to tones exhibit outer hair cell loss that varies systematically along the cochlea as a function of exposure frequency  <cit> .

in order to better understand the role of peripheral processes involved in frequency discrimination in fishes, we examined the tonotopic pattern of saccular hair cell damage in response to tone exposures in goldfish . we also tested hearing loss in the same fishes to understand the relationship between localized hair cell loss and hearing loss. this is the first study to attempt to correlate patterns of hair cell loss with frequency-specific hearing loss in fishes.

RESULTS
effects of tone exposure on the goldfish saccule
only data from the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hz exposures are presented here.

it was difficult to obtain consistent auditory evoked potential recordings from fish exposed to the  <dig> hz tone, and the saccules from these fish had extensive damage that made hair cell bundle counts difficult and variable. it is unclear why damage would be more extensive at this frequency, but two possibilities are that this frequency is near the frequency of peak hearing sensitivity in goldfish and that the sound stimulus exhibited much stronger harmonics at  <dig> hz than was found in the other exposure frequencies. thus, we did not analyze the  <dig> hz exposure data.

numbers of hair cell bundles were counted in  <dig> pre-selected  <dig> ×  <dig> μm areas of both saccules of each fish . among the control fish, hair cell bundle counts varied significantly along the length of the saccule . hair cell density was greatest at the far-rostral and far-caudal regions  and decreased toward the central region .

all groups of sound-exposed fish exhibited significant loss of hair cell bundles , but the pattern of hair cell bundle loss varied as a function of exposure tone frequency  and rostral-caudal axis region , with a significant interaction between these two variables . the areas of loss were fairly localized. in the damaged areas, hair cell bundles were sparse. some were completely missing, exposing the underlying cuticular plates, and some of the remaining hair cells exhibited ragged, splayed, and fractured stereocilia . hair cell loss produced by the  <dig> hz tone occurred primarily in the rostral area, in regions  <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz tones also destroyed hair cells in the rostral area, but the general area of hair cell loss was shifted more caudally on the saccule. the  <dig> hz tone produced the greatest hair cell loss in rostral regions  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> hz produced greatest loss in rostral region  <dig> . in general, areas of saccular hair cell loss were smaller for groups exposed to higher frequencies compared to areas of hair cell bundle loss in groups that were exposed to lower frequencies. the lowest frequency tone  only affected the caudal region of the saccule with the greatest hair cell loss occurring in regions  <dig> and  <dig> in most fish . the saccule from one individual exposed to the  <dig> hz tone exhibited an aberrant pattern of damage that extended dorso-rostrally into region  <dig>  but the whole epithelial region appeared to be damaged, not merely the hair cells.

hair cell bundle loss varied across the width of the saccule as well, with the greatest loss occurring along the central portion of the saccule . differential loss across the width of the saccule was especially notable for the  <dig> hz group, in which the majority of hair cell loss occurred in the dorsal and central areas of the rostral region. the  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz tones produced the greatest and smallest overall percentages of hair cell loss, respectively .

effect of tone exposure on goldfish auditory thresholds
all sound-exposed fish had significantly higher hearing thresholds compared to controls . we will refer to these changes as temporary threshold shifts  since recovery from hearing loss has been reported for goldfish  <cit> , and since permanent threshold shifts  have not been reported for fishes. hearing loss varied with treatment, with mean tts associated with  <dig> hz tone exposure being greater than that of  <dig> and  <dig> khz . additionally,  <dig> hz tone exposures resulted in threshold shifts that were greater than that of  <dig> khz exposures .

there were also significant differences in tts between audiogram frequencies within specific tone exposures. for the  <dig> hz tone exposure, tts was significantly smaller at  <dig> -  <dig> khz compared to lower frequencies . no significant differences occurred in tts across frequencies following the  <dig> hz tone exposure although the highest mean tts occurred at  <dig> and  <dig> hz  and the lowest at the extremes of  <dig> hz  and  <dig> khz . in fish exposed to the  <dig> khz tone, threshold shifts were greater at  <dig> -  <dig> khz compared to  <dig> khz and frequencies  <dig> hz and lower .

the  <dig> khz tone resulted in perhaps the most complex pattern of hearing loss. tts at  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> khz, but not  <dig> khz, were significantly higher than those at frequencies  <dig> hz and lower . in general, fish exposed to lower frequency tones exhibited greater threshold shifts at lower frequencies, while high-tone exposure led to greater hearing loss at higher frequencies .

when tts data for all treatments were pooled, there was a significant change in tts across audiogram frequencies , with maximal hearing loss at  <dig> khz, the frequency of greatest hearing sensitivity in the goldfish . post-hoc tukey tests showed that when tts were pooled across tone treatments, tts at  <dig> and  <dig> hz were significantly lower than that of those at 800- <dig> hz , tts at  <dig> hz was significantly lower than those of 800- <dig> hz , and tts at  <dig> hz was significantly higher than those of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hz .

relationship between hair cell and hearing loss
to examine the relationship between hair cell loss and hearing loss more closely, mean percent hair cell loss  and mean tts  were calculated for each individual fish, and plotted against the stimulus tone of the acoustic exposure. a similar pattern was evident for both hair cell and hearing loss - a decrease in loss with increased frequency of exposure . when plotted together, a significant linear relationship exists between mean percent hair cell loss and mean tts . this relationship predicts an  <dig> db average hearing loss for a 20% average loss of hair cells, and a  <dig> db average hearing loss for a 60% average loss of hair cells. since the means in this analysis are averaged across both frequencies in the audiogram and locations of the saccule, no potential tonotopic relationship can be statistically tested without a priori subjectively assigning regions along the rostral-caudal axis of the saccule to frequencies of hearing sensitivity.

in order to compare the relationship between specific locations of hair cell bundle loss and hearing loss at specific frequencies, we made two three-dimensional graphs. in the first graph, we plotted percent hair cell bundle loss at all  <dig> specified locations for each fish saccule as a function of frequency of the exposure tone and the location along the rostral-caudal axis of the saccule . this graph reiterates the results previously discussed - that is, low frequency tone exposure resulted in dramatic hair cell loss in the caudal end of the saccule and minimal damage in the rostral side, while the opposite is true for high frequency tone exposures. in the second graph, we plotted hearing loss  for all fish tested as a function of frequency of the exposure tone and the frequency of the hearing threshold being tested . a similar pattern was evident. low frequency tone exposure resulted in significant threshold shifts at low frequencies, but minimal hearing loss at high frequencies, while high frequency tones resulted in significant threshold shifts at high frequencies, but not at lower frequencies.

while both plots result in smoothed surfaces that resemble a piece of paper with the opposite diagonal corners pulled down, one of the downward slopes is much more dramatic with the hair cell loss data  than with the tts data . what this means is that at low frequencies of tone exposure, there is a dramatic drop in hair cell loss in the rostral saccule, but a relatively smaller drop in hearing loss at high frequencies. in other words, low frequency exposure tones still caused high-frequency tts even though hair cell loss was fairly low in the rostral region which presumably detects high-frequency sounds.

the similarity between the smoothed surfaces of these two plots is what one would expect if the goldfish saccule is indeed tonotopically organized. using these plots, and the tonotopic pattern of damage in the saccule , we suggest that along the rostral-caudal axis of the saccule, regions 1- <dig>  2- <dig>  3- <dig>  and 6- <dig> correspond to frequency sensitivities near  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  khz, respectively.

discussion
tonotopic damage in the goldfish saccule
we found a distinct caudal to rostral shift in hair cell bundle loss with exposure frequency, with the  <dig> hz tone producing damage localized to the caudal saccule and the  <dig> khz tone producing damage to the rostral saccule. a frequency-dependent spatial pattern of sound-induced damage in the inner ear has been reported for other vertebrates  <cit> , but only one prior study has suggested that a similar tonotopic pattern may also be found in teleost fishes.

enger  <cit>  investigated the effect of intense tone exposure in atlantic cod . cod saccular maculae were examined for damage through scanning electron microscopy following exposure to intense tones  ranging in frequency from  <dig> to  <dig> hz. damaged areas of epithelia had an almost complete loss of hair cell stereocilia, leaving only cuticular plates or a few disorganized stereocilia on hair cells. as exposure frequency increased, the areas of damaged epithelia were located in successively more rostral regions of the saccule. it was also observed that all frequencies produced damage in the central region of the saccule.

our data show a similar pattern of tone-induced hair cell loss in goldfish, despite differences in hearing sensitivity and bandwidth. the range of hearing is  <dig> to  <dig> hz in cod, with hearing thresholds recorded at 75- <dig> db re  <dig> μpa at  <dig> hz  <cit> , while goldfish hear a greater range of frequencies, from  <dig> to greater than  <dig> hz, with greatest sensitivity between  <dig> and  <dig> hz  <cit> . the weberian ossicles of goldfish and other otophysan fishes mechanically link their swim bladder to their inner ear  <cit> . this specialization allows goldfish to be more sensitive to the pressure component of sound. fish without such modifications, such as cod, are less sensitive to pressure, and possess hearing thresholds that are higher and cover narrower frequency bandwidths than fish with such specializations  <cit> . since the ears of teleost fishes differ so much between species, it is likely that tonotopic patterns in the auditory epithelia also differ across taxa, especially between fishes that are pressure sensitive compared to fishes that detect only particle motion. yet, the overall tonotopic pattern of auditory hair cell loss is similar between goldfish and cod, with low and high frequency tones damaging caudal and rostral portions of the saccule, respectively. this suggests that tonotopy of the saccule may function as a mechanism of peripheral frequency discrimination across multiple orders of fishes.

we found that hair cell loss occurred in the central region of the saccule for most tone-exposed goldfish  and that overall threshold shifts were greatest at middle frequencies  for all tone-exposed fish . since these middle frequencies correspond to the frequencies of greatest sensitivity in the goldfish  <cit> , we surmise that these centrally located hair cells preferentially respond to middle frequencies and that these hair cells are generally more prone to acoustically-induced damage. while this may be the result of morphological differences in these hair cells , it is more likely the result of the mechanical connection between the sensory epithelium and the otolith, and the frequency-specific relative motion between the two.

another pattern that was evident was that areas of hair cell damage became generally smaller with increasing exposure frequency. the frequency-position functions are logarithmic in nature in humans and other mammals  <cit> . that is, lower frequencies are represented by locations that are spread apart farther on the basilar membrane than higher frequencies, with the frequency-position distances decreasing with frequency. although the fish ear does not have as precise of a frequency-place mechanism provided by the macromechanical arrangement of the cochlea, a similar logarithmic frequency-position function may occur in fishes. this would explain why there is little overlap in damaged areas of goldfish saccules caused by  <dig> and  <dig> hz exposures , and considerable overlap caused by  <dig> and  <dig> hz exposures . in cod, there was a greater degree of overlap of damaged areas resulting from tone exposures ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> hz  <cit> . this may be because the high intensity of sounds used  and/or the smaller bandwidth of hearing in cod . non-otophysan fishes have smaller bandwidths of hearing, poorer hearing sensitivity, and poorer frequency discrimination compared to otophysan fishes  <cit> . thus, one might expect a coarser tonotopic map in non-otophysans compared to otophysan fishes like goldfish.

the high intensities used during the sound exposures in the current study may have been enough to spread the area of damage across the saccule beyond the region that normally responds to a given tone, affecting the sensitive, centrally-located hair cells. previous studies have demonstrated that very intense sound damages an extended region of the hearing end organ in birds and mammals. for example, in chicks, the damaged area of the basilar papilla varies with exposure frequency, but also with tone intensity; a secondary region of damage is created with increased sound pressure level  <cit> . in the chick, exposure to lower frequencies produced a larger region of damage than did exposure to higher frequencies. this is similar to the data that we report here--in goldfish, the greatest hair cell loss occurred with the lowest stimulation frequency , and the greatest tts also occurred at  <dig> hz .

intense octave band noise can cause focal lesions that extend beyond the frequency-place range of the exposure sound in the cochlea of chinchillas  <cit> , and it is known that the basilar membrane of mammals become more broadly tuned with increased stimulus intensity  <cit> . whether such a pattern exists in goldfish is unknown. future experiments with lower exposure intensities are needed to see if damaged areas become more localized as sound pressure level decreases.

potential mechanisms for tonotopy in the saccule
the mechanisms that contribute to tonotopic mapping in the fish saccule have not been fully elucidated, but there are several possibilities. one potential mechanism is that the otolith overlying the saccular epithelium vibrates differentially in response to varying frequency. while the modeling of fluid motion around otolith-like spheroids has recently been conducted  <cit> , direct measurement of otolith vibration is rarely done. sand and michelsen  <cit>  used laser vibrometry to measure the vertical vibration of saccular otoliths in perch  in response to four frequencies of horizontal movement. they found that the amplitude of vibration varied across the length of the otolith in a frequency-dependent manner, suggesting that the otolith motion had a rotational component and that this might explain observed peripheral frequency analysis in teleost fishes. the goldfish saccular otolith, the sagitta, is long, thin, and delicate with a twist in the middle similar to an airplane propeller  <cit> . it has been proposed that such an otolith design may have a role in frequency analysis  <cit> , but little is known about the mechanical properties of the gelatinous otolithic membrane and its coupling with hair cells.

it is also likely that characteristics of the sensory cells themselves are at least partially responsible for the tonotopic damage found in this study. our finding of a shift in hair cell density along the goldfish saccular rostral-caudal axis is consistent with that found by other researchers. higgs et al.  <cit>  found that hair cell density in zebrafish , a close relative of goldfish, was greatest at the caudal tip, least dense in the middle, and intermediate at the rostral tip of the saccule. similar patterns have also been found previously in goldfish  <cit> .

goldfish auditory hair cells also show ultrastructural differences that vary by location on the saccule  <cit> . for example, hair cell size, mitochondria and synaptic body sizes, subnuclear layering of the cisternae, and afferent diameter have also been found to vary across the length of the goldfish saccule  <cit> . in goldfish, hair cell stereociliar and kinociliar length varies by location, with longer kinocilia found in the caudal end and shorter kinocilia in the rostral end. we have also observed differences in stereociliar length across the length of the goldfish and zebrafish saccule . interestingly, no such pattern of hair cell length is found in the nonotophysan kissing gourami helostoma temmincki  <cit> .

it is thought that fish hair cells demonstrate micromechanical tuning through differences in hair cell bundle stiffness, mode of attachment to the otolithic membrane  <cit> , and electrical tuning  <cit> . outer hair cell stereocilia length is strongly correlated with the frequency of best response in the mammalian cochlea, with shorter and longer hair cells responding best to higher and lower frequencies, respectively  <cit> . it appears that a similar arrangement is found in the goldfish saccule. similarly, tonotopic gradients of mechanotransduction channel conductance have been found in hair cells of the hearing end organs of turtles, birds, and goldfish  <cit> . hair cell resonance frequency gradients are also seen in turtles and frogs  <cit> .

goldfish possess excellent tone discrimination ability, distinguishing tone differences as small as  <dig>  hz at  <dig> hz  <cit> . in addition to saccular tonotopy, which appears to be rather crude in fishes, other peripheral and central processes likely contribute to frequency analysis in fishes. some frequency filtering occurs in goldfish at the saccular level through afferent nerve fibers. fay and ream  <cit>  found four non-overlapping categories of saccular nerve fibers . this data suggest that there are just a few filters across the hearing bandwidth and very broad tuning of primary auditory afferents in fishes  <cit> . central processing appears to play a role in fine frequency discrimination through mechanisms such as phase-locking in auditory units in fish and amphibians, with the occurrence of phase-locking appearing to diminish along the auditory pathway  <cit> . for example, phase-locking has been found in the medulla of trout, cod, and goldfish  <cit> , and in the torus semicircularis  of trout and goldfish  <cit> .

effect of tone frequency on goldfish threshold shifts
goldfish threshold shifts varied with frequency of tone exposure as predicted, with the  <dig> hz tone exposure causing greater threshold shifts at lower frequencies and  <dig> and  <dig> hz tones causing threshold shifts primarily at higher frequencies. as there was significant overlap in regions of damaged saccular epithelia caused by different tone exposures, there was also considerable overlap in frequencies that were affected by a particular tone exposure. for example, the  <dig> hz tone exposure caused significant threshold shifts across all frequencies but this effect was much greater at frequencies below  <dig>  khz, while the  <dig> khz tone also caused significant threshold shifts across all frequencies but the largest threshold shifts occurred at frequencies ≥ <dig> khz .

such overlap has been seen in other studies in which fish were acoustically over-stimulated. for example, popper and clarke  <cit>  found that goldfish that were exposed to an  <dig> hz tone exhibited threshold shifts at both  <dig> and  <dig> hz, although the threshold shifts were greater at  <dig> hz. similarly, fathead minnows  exhibited an 8- <dig> db tts in response to  <dig> h of  <dig> db re  <dig> μpa narrow bandwidth boat motor noise with a peak frequency near  <dig>  khz  <cit> . while the greatest threshold shift occurred at  <dig>  khz , threshold shifts also occurred at  <dig> and  <dig> khz. in previous studies, goldfish exposed to white noise exhibited hearing loss across their hearing bandwidth, with threshold shifts being greatest at  <dig> khz, where hearing sensitivity is greatest  <cit> . similarly, mean threshold shifts were generally greatest at  <dig> khz in this study, even when the exposure tone varied considerably from  <dig> khz .

it is not surprising that the goldfish had the greatest hearing loss at frequencies where their hearing is most sensitive because the difference between the sound pressure level of the exposure tone and the level of hearing threshold is greatest at these frequencies. this concept was formalized as a predictive model of hearing loss called the linear threshold shift  hypothesis  <cit> . in this model, threshold shifts increase linearly as a function of the sound pressure difference  between an exposure sound and baseline hearing thresholds, and not just the sound pressure level of the exposure sound per se. the advantage of using spds is that they account for differences in hearing sensitivity across different frequencies in the animal's audiogram. the lints model was developed using a white noise stimulus, with equal intensity across the frequencies tested. since most organisms have u-shaped audiograms that are more sensitive at mid-frequencies and less sensitive at lower and higher frequencies, the spd between a white noise stimulus and hearing thresholds is greatest at mid-frequencies. thus, tts is predicted to be greatest at these mid-frequencies  <cit> .

the current study used tonal stimuli such that the spd between the tone and the hearing threshold was greatest at the frequency of the exposure tone and should have been minimal at all other frequencies. thus, according to the lints model, tts would be expected only at or near the frequency of the exposure tone. this obviously did not occur-tts occurred at multiple, if not all of the frequencies tested, although low frequency tones produced the greatest tts at low frequencies and high frequency tones produced greatest tts at high frequencies. we tested the lints relationship by plotting tts against spd and performing linear regression analysis between these two variables. in this analysis, only tts at hearing frequencies equal to the exposure tone were used since the maximal sound pressure level measured was that of the exposure tone and not adjacent frequencies . this relationship was not significant  +  <dig> ; r <dig> =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). one potential explanation for this observation is that the stimulus intensity used in this study may have been too high for the lints model to make effective predictions. as previously discussed, louder exposure stimuli produce greater areas of sensory cell damage, and thus hearing loss, over a greater range of frequencies. a replication of this study at lower stimulation intensities would shed light on the overall validity of the lints model for predicting hearing loss in fishes.

relationship between hair cell and hearing loss
loss of hair cells is correlated with a loss of hearing in other vertebrates  <cit>  so we expected to find a similar relationship between hair cell bundle and hearing loss in fishes. only one previous study has examined the relationship between hair cell loss and hearing loss in fishes. smith et al.  <cit>  exposed goldfish to white noise for  <dig> h, which resulted in both significant hair cell loss and threshold shifts. within  <dig> days thresholds almost completely recovered, and this hearing recovery coincided with a regeneration of hair cells. similar to the current study, tts was greatest at  <dig> khz, but hair cell loss was limited to the caudal and central regions of the saccule following the white noise exposure.

in the current study, there was considerable overlap in hearing loss across frequencies and hair cell loss across saccular regions for a given exposure tone. while this may be the result of the effect of the high intensity of the exposure stimuli that we used in this study, this overlap could also reflect the coarseness of the tonotopic map in the goldfish saccule, suggesting that the peripheral auditory filters are broadly tuned. another possible explanation for this overlap is harmonics of our tone signals that were evident in our acoustic exposure and difficult to avoid in our small exposure chamber . while peak sound pressure levels at the nominal tone of interest were at least  <dig> db greater than any harmonic, it is still possible that these harmonics of the nominal tone could have caused some auditory damage, thus broadening the area of saccular hair cell loss and the bandwidth of hearing loss.

a similar pattern was evident for both hair cell and hearing loss - a decrease in loss with increased frequency of exposure . a similar relationship has been found in the chick basilar papilla, with lower frequency tone exposures producing greater hair cell loss over a greater area of the epithelium compared to damage from high frequency tones  <cit> . more narrow frequency bands of threshold shifts were associated with smaller regions of hair cell loss that resulted from higher frequency exposures. an opposite pattern is found in mammals, which are more sensitive at higher frequencies compared to birds and fishes. guinea pigs exposed to pure tones exhibited much greater hair cell damage after exposure to frequencies of  <dig> khz and above compared to that of  <dig> and  <dig> hz  <cit> . obviously, the shape of an organism's audiogram will have an effect on how susceptible its auditory system is to damage from a particular frequency of sound.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that overexposure to pure tones causes tonotopically-organized morphological damage in the goldfish saccule. damage is characterized as a significant decrease in hair cell bundle density. areas of damage varied with tone frequency, with damage shifting rostrally across the length of the saccule as frequency increased. in addition, there was a corresponding shift in hearing loss with low and high frequency tones causing threshold shifts at lower and higher frequencies, respectively. these data suggest that goldfish use at least a crude level of tonotopy in the saccule to peripherally discriminate between tones.
