BACKGROUND
ccpa is a conserved regulator protein in gram-positive bacteria, which was first characterized as a transcriptional regulator responsible for glucose repression on α-amylase synthesis in bacillus subtilis, a model firmicute bacterium
 <cit> . the later studies have demonstrated that b. subtilis ccpa is a master repressor or activator to many cellular processes, such as sugar transport
 <cit> , glycolysis
 <cit> , ammonium assimilation
 <cit>  and d-xylose and l-arabinose metabolism
 <cit> . in clostridium species, ccpa was reported to be involved in various cellular processes, such as glucose repression on d-xylose metabolism in c. acetobutylicum by our laboratory
 <cit> ; also efficient sporulation and enterotoxin gene regulation
 <cit> , biofilm formation
 <cit>  and gliding in pathogen c. perfringens <cit> ; and repression of toxin gene expression in c. difficile <cit> .

gram-positive c. acetobutylicum has been used to produce organic solvents through a so-called abe  fermentation process
 <cit> . among several solvents that abe fermentation process produces, butanol has attracted significant attention in recent years as a potential next-generation liquid fuel
 <cit> . compared to the other existing biofuels, such as ethanol, butanol offers advantages as a gasoline substitute because of its higher energy content and hydrophobicity
 <cit> . c. acetobutylicum genome contains one ccpa gene
 <cit> , the product of which shares 42% amino acid identity with that of b. subtilis. however, currently very little is known about the regulatory roles of ccpa in c. acetobutylicum. our previous analysis showed that c. acetobutylicum ccpa mutant established significant phenotypic changes  compared to its parental strain
 <cit> , suggesting that in addition to regulation of d-xylose metabolism, ccpa may be involved in regulation of other cellular processes in c. acetobutylicum.

since ccpa likely exerts pleiotropic regulation in c. acetobutylicum, it thus raises an intriguing question, namely whether c. acetobutylicum ccpa is involved in regulating specific cellular processes that are closely related to its industry applications, such as acids re-assimilation, solvents forming, sporulation and capability of utilizing non-preferable sugars
 <cit> . positive modification of regulation of these cellular processes will result in significant improvement in terms of economic feasibility of industrial-scale butanol production.

in this study, we employed a comparative transcriptome analysis in combination with genetic and biochemical validation to determine the possible regulatory functions of ccpa in c. acetobutylicum. the results showed ccpa is an important pleiotropic regulator in c. acetobutylicum: i) activating genes in d-glucose-specific phosphotransferase system , enhancing d-glucose utilization; ii) mediating carbon catabolite repression on non-preferred carbon sources utilization; iii) regulation of acidogenesis and solventogenesis pathways; and iv) necessary for efficient sporulation. the study revealed novel aspects of ccpa regulatory functions in c. acetobutylicum, offering new targets for further engineering this solventogenic clostridia.

RESULTS
global changes of transcriptome of c. acetobutylicum caused by ccpa inactivation
since the regulatory roles of c. acetobutylicum ccpa in fermenting d-glucose and d-xylose mixture  are of great interest, these two mono sugars were used as the carbon sources in our fermentation experiments, from which samples were taken for microarray assay. we have previously found that inactivation of the ccpa gene caused acids accumulation in c. acetobutylicum, resulting in a deficient growth
 <cit> . therefore, in order to create a normal growth profile for the ccpa-inactivated strain , ph was controlled  during the fermentation process for the 824ccpa as well as the wild type strain  . microarray analysis was performed to investigate global control of gene expression by ccpa during growth on d-glucose and d-xylose at four time points, at which a <dig> values of the 824wt and 824ccpa were similar . the time point m  and l  were in acidogenic phase, while the time point t  and s  were in shift phase  and solventogenic phase, respectively. in addition, in order to confirm whether the genes involved in carbohydrates uptake and metabolism, which were found to be repressed by ccpa, are also subject to “glucose repression” , the transcriptional levels of these genes in 824wt were also investigated using microarray in the presence  and absence  of d-glucose .

 overview of dna microarray analysis
comparative transcriptomic analysis of the 824ccpa and 824wt showed that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed  in the phase m, l, t and s, respectively . in addition, more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes were found throughout the phase m, l and t, while nearly equal numbers of up- and down-regulated genes identified in phase s .

the differentially expressed genes could be grouped into  <dig> subsets with known or predicted functions . the majority of these genes are related to core metabolism  . the genes  responsible for carbohydrate transport and metabolism account for a large percentage of total genes with differential expression, occupying  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in phase m, l, t and s, respectively .

 qrt-pcr validation for microarray quality
a subset of  <dig> genes was selected for qrt-pcr validation. among these genes,  <dig>  were found to be up-regulated according to the microarray data,  <dig>  were down-regulated, and the gene cysc was down-regulated in the middle exponential phase and up-regulated in the transition phase instead. an obvious positive correlation can be detected between qrt-pcr and microarray results for these genes , suggesting a good quality of microarray data.

†the wild-type  and ccpa-inactivated mutant strain  were cultured in p <dig> medium using 40 g/l d-glucose and 20 g/l d-xylose as the carbon sources. cells were harvested at middle exponential phase  and early stationary phase .

* the data were mean ± standard deviation  of two independent biological replicates.

§ the microarray result of the ctfb gene at s phase was inaccurate because its expression level exceeded the detection upper limit.

prediction of ccpa binding sites based on microarray data
it has been known that ccpa can directly regulate its target genes by binding to the cre sites
 <cit> . here, such a cre motif  was retrieved for the up-regulated genes after ccpa inactivation in c. acetobutylicum by using gibbs motif sampler program
 <cit> . the putative cre motif of c. acetobutylicum showed high similarity  to the previously identified b. subtilis cre motif according to the motif comparison utility tomtom
 <cit> , indicating that these cre sequences are reliable. in the contrary, despite that some down-regulated genes were found to harbor putative cre sites , no such a conserved motif can be retrieved from the promoter sequences of these genes, thus indicating that the ccpa-binding sites of most of the down-regulated genes are atypical or they might be indirectly regulated by ccpa.

next, we adopted hmm 
 <cit> , which was built based on the above cre sequences, to search all potential ccpa-binding cre sites in c. acetobutylicum. the bit score assigned by hmmsearch program reflects the similarity of a sequence match to a profile hidden markov model
 <cit> . the result  showed that  <dig> and  <dig> putative cre sites were detected upstream of the open reading frame  and within orf region, respectively. the consensus motif of these cre sites was visualized in figure 
 <dig> 

effect of ccpa on carbohydrates uptake and metabolism
large number of genes, involved in carbohydrate uptake and catabolism, were affected by ccpa inactivation in c. acetobutylicum . a total of  <dig> genes exhibited significant  alterations in expression levels, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . expressional levels of most of the ccpa-repressed genes  in the 824wt were up-regulated when d-glucose was depleted from the glucose-xylose mixture , indicating that ccpa did mediate carbon catabolite repression  on these  <dig> genes. the majority  of the ccpa-repressed genes or operons  harbored cre sites in their upstream or orf regions , which is consistent with the previous observations in bacillus and lactobacillus species <cit> .

 pts sugar transport and metabolism
microarray results showed that many genes responsible for typical pts transporters and enzymes catalyzing metabolism of non-glucose carbohydrates, such as fructose, mannose, cellobiose, galactose, lactose
 <cit> , sucrose
 <cit> , maltose and mannitol, exhibited higher expression in the 824ccpa compared to the 824wt . since most of these genes or operons were predicted to harbor ccpa-binding sites  in the promoters or orf regions , it seems that ccpa can directly repress them through binding to these cre sites. among these genes, cac <dig> and cac <dig> may deserve some attention. although these two genes have been annotated as glucose-specific pts components in the previous studies
 <cit> , they might be involved in transporting other pts sugars because: i) these two genes were subject to ccpa-mediated glucose repression , indicating that they unlikely act as glucose-specific pts components; ii) according to the genome context analysis
 <cit> , they are included in one operon in combination with pagl , which could not be induced by d-glucose
 <cit> .
 <cit> ; xynb, beta-xylosidase; xylb, xylulose kinase; tkt1/tkt <dig>  transketolase; tal, transaldolase; araa1/araa <dig>  l-arabinose isomerase; arak, ribulokinase
 <cit> ; arad, l-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase; scra, beta-glucosides specific pts iibca component; scrb, sucrase-6-phosphate hydrolase; scrk, fructokinase; mltf, mannitol-specific pts iia component; mtla, mannitol-specific pts iibc component; mtld, mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase; frub, 1-phosphofructokinase; pmi, phosphomannose isomerase; glva, maltose-6-phosphate glucosidase; glgc, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase; glga, starch synthase; lacg, 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase; laca, galactose-6-phosphate isomerase subunit a; lacb, galactose-6-phosphate isomerase subunit b; lacc, tagatose-6-phosphate kinase; gaty, tagatose-bisphosphate aldolase; galk, galactokinase; galt, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; gale, udp-galactose 4-epimerase; glpk, glycerol kinase; glpa, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; gana, arabinogalactan endo- <dig> -beta-galactosidase; glpf, glycerol uptake facilitator protein; glck, glucokinase; glvg, 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase; glgc, glucose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase; glga, glycogen synthase; arat , arabinosides-proton symporter
 <cit> ; arb <dig>  alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase ii precursor
 <cit> ; ptk, phosphoketolase; rpi, ribose 5-phosphate isomerase; rpe, aldose-1-epimerase; epi, arabinose mutarotase; gap, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; f1p, fructose 1-phosphate; f6p, fructose 6-phosphate; fbp, fructose  <dig> -biphosphate; g6p, glucose 6-phosphate; g1p, glucose 1-phosphate; c6p, cellobiose 6-phosphate; xylu5p, xylulose 5-phosphate; dha, dihydroxyacetone.

in addition, a cre site was found in the orf region of cac <dig> , which is a histidine kinase-encoding gene embraced in a transcription unit cac1453-cac1454-cac1455-cac <dig>  within this unit: gene cac <dig>  which was up-regulated after ccpa inactivation , is annotated as a periplasmic ribose-binding component of abc transporter in the genbank sequence database provided by the national center for biotechnology information , whereas annotated as a periplasmic fructose-binding protein in database seed 
 <cit> ; gene cac <dig>  encoding a periplasmic fructose-binding protein component of signal transduction system levq , was also found to be related to fructose utilization
 <cit> . therefore, this gene cluster is likely responsible for fructose metabolism.

in contrast, gene glcg , cac <dig> and cac <dig>  encoding d-glucose pts enzyme ii components, were all significantly down-regulated after ccpa inactivation . this observation suggested that ccpa may be necessary for the efficient expression of d-glucose pts genes in c. acetobutylicum. it should be noted that the importance of gene glcg in d-glucose uptake has been previously described
 <cit> . our previous study also showed that its inactivation has potential value of alleviating glucose repression on non-preferable sugars metabolism
 <cit> . besides, the gene ptsi , encoding phosphoenolpyruvate-protein kinase , was also significantly down-regulated here . therefore, the down-regulation of glcg, cac1353- <dig> and ptsi might be responsible for the slower d-glucose consumption rate of the 824ccpa compared to the 824wt , thus resulting in alleviation of glucose repression on non-preferable sugars
 <cit> . in addition, a cre site was found in the intergenic region of cac <dig> and cac <dig>  two divergently transcribed genes, whereas no such sites were found for gene glcg and ptsi . the results indicated that ccpa might directly regulate either cac <dig> or cac <dig> or both, but affect the expression of glcg and ptsi indirectly or through binding to atypical cre sites.

the cggr operon-like gene cluster cac0708-gapcpgktpiapgmeno , which is highly similar to the b. subtilis cggr operon  and encodes several key enzymes for glycolysis
 <cit> , did not exhibit obvious difference in the transcriptional change between the 824ccpa and 824wt . this result is quite different to what has been found in b. subtilis, in which all these genes were activated by ccpa. in addition, gene cac <dig>  encoding an aldehyde: ferredoxin oxidoreductase for catalyzing the conversion from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to glycerate-3-phosphate, was the only glycolysis-related gene which exhibited significant up-regulation after ccpa inactivation , however, no typical cre site could be found in either the upstream region or the orf of cac <dig> 

 polysaccharides metabolism
the expression of the putative granulose-synthetic gene cluster cac2237-cac <dig> 
 <cit>  was significantly down-regulated by ccpa inactivation , however, no putative cre sites can be found in its upstream region. on the contrary, several genes responsible for starch degradation exhibited significant up-regulation after ccpa inactivation: an α-amylase gene amya <dig> , two α-glucosidase genes  and a possible glucoamylase gene  . these four genes all have putative cre sites  in their upstream regions or orfs, suggesting that ccpa might regulate them directly. as to another starch-degrading gene amya <dig> , no obvious changes were found in the expression level at the first three phases, and only a  <dig> -fold increase occurred at s phase , which was much lower than fold-changes of other starch-degrading genes. considering that no potential cre site can be found upstream of the amya <dig> gene, and the fact that gene amya <dig> showed no obvious change in transcriptional level when cells were cultivated with and without starch
 <cit>  and amya2-encoded α-amylase could be readily purified from the cells grown on d-glucose
 <cit> , this gene is unlikely subject to ccpa-dependent glucose repression in c. acetobutylicum. it should be noted here that amya <dig> and amya <dig> likely act as the major genes responsible for starch degradation in c. acetobutylicum, because the loss of the megaplasmid psol <dig>  caused serious defect in starch degradation
 <cit> .

it is known that cellulases and several scaffolding proteins organize as cellulosome in some clostridium species
 <cit> . c. acetobutylicum also harbors a series of cellulosome-encoding genes, but its cellulosome did not exhibit activity required to degrade crystalline cellulose
 <cit> . we found that two glucanase-encoding genes, namely cac <dig>  and cac <dig> -beta-glucanase), and several β-glucosidase-encoding genes  were all up-regulated in the 824ccpa in comparison to the 824wt . putative cre sites were also identified in the upstream or orf regions of four out of these six genes, i.e. cac <dig>  cac <dig>  cac <dig> and cac <dig> . moreover, we noticed that these four genes all showed up-regulation in the 824wt strain when d-glucose was depleted , suggesting that they were subject to ccpa-mediated glucose repression. many other genes responsible for cellulose degradation  showed no differential expression after ccpa inactivation, indicating that they may be not subject to ccpa-mediated regulation.

c. acetobutylicum is capable of degrading xylan under some specified conditions
 <cit> , and a total of fourteen genes were found to be related to hemicellulose degradation and metabolism
 <cit> . we observed that inactivation of ccpa resulted in up-regulation in transcriptional levels of genes responsible for xylan degradation, including cap0053-cap <dig> operon , cap0114-cap <dig> , cac <dig> , cac <dig> , arb <dig>  and arat  . in addition, two genes  and gene cac <dig>  encoding putative arabinogalactan-degrading enzymes and mannanase, respectively, all exhibited up-regulation after ccpa inactivation . possible cre sites were identified upstream of all these genes or operons except for gene cac <dig> . therefore, in combination with the observation that expression of these genes was repressed in the presence of d-glucose , the results here strongly suggested that they are subject to ccpa-dependent ccr.

 pentose transport and metabolism
according to the previous studies
 <cit> , we illustrated the genomic organization of genes for pentose utilization in c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> . a large number of genes involved in uptake and metabolism of pentose, such as d-xylose and l-arabinose, showed differential expression after inactivation of the ccpa. two gene clusters, namely cac2610-cac <dig> and cac1339-cac <dig>  are responsible for d-xylose and l-arabinose uptake and metabolism in c. acetobutylicum <cit> .

gene xyla  and gene xylb  have been experimentally confirmed as the primary candidates encoding d-xylose isomerase and xylulokinase
 <cit> , respectively. these two genes, found to be co-expressed as one operon with cac <dig> , were significantly up-regulated after ccpa inactivation  and were subject to glucose repression . in addition, two putative cre sites were found in this operon: one is in the upstream region of xylb and the other is in the orf of xyla . when fermentation was performed using mixed d-glucose and d-xylose as the carbon sources, improved d-xylose utilization was observed by the 824ccpa compared to the 824wt .

the cac1339-cac <dig> cluster contains most of the genes necessary for l-arabinose uptake and metabolism, including arae1/arae <dig> , araa1/araa <dig> , arak 
 <cit> , arad , epi  and three genes associated with pentose phosphate pathway , namely ptk , tal  and tkt <dig> 
 <cit> . microarray results showed that, except for cac1340-cac <dig>  all genes in this locus  exhibited much higher transcriptional level in the 824ccpa versus the 824wt at all four phases . obviously, these genes  are subject to glucose repression . one putative cre site was found inside the orf of arak and upstream of arae <dig>  respectively, while there were two cre sites located in the upstream region of arae <dig> . gene cac <dig>  encoding a transcriptional repressor arar of l-arabinose operon
 <cit> , showed no change in transcriptional level between the 824ccpa and 824wt. gene set arad-araa1-ptk  displayed only a slightly differential expression , although a putative cre was located in the intergenic region of gene arar and gene arad . we noticed that the arad-araa1-ptk was weakly induced by d-xylose whereas strongly induced by l-arabinose
 <cit> , which indicated that the slight transcriptional change of arad-araa1-ptk observed here might be attributed to the absence of a strong inducer, namely l-arabinose. we thereby investigated the expression of arad-araa1-ptk in both 824wt and 824ccpa in the presence of d-glucose and l-arabinose. the result showed that the transcriptional levels of both arad and ptk were much higher  in the 824ccpa compared to those of the 824wt , demonstrating that this gene set  was subject to ccpa-dependent glucose repression and l-arabinose induction. a recent study has identified three arar-binding sites in the upstream region of arad-araa <dig> <cit> , indicating a strong repression of this gene set by arar according to the arar’s action mode in b. subtilis <cit> . moreover, arar exhibited higher affinity for the upstream region of gene ptk than that of operon arak-arae2-araa2-tal-tkt1-epi <cit> . therefore, the reason for the insufficient induction of d-xylose to the arad-araa1-ptk here could be that d-xylose is not enough to release such a repression of arar on the gene set arad-araa1-ptk. in addition, only slight transcriptional change of gene arar was found in the 824ccpa compared to the 824wt when fermenting l-arabinose and d-glucose mixture . in combination with the observation that arar was not subjected to glucose repression , we thus speculated that arar is not subject to ccpa-dependent ccr. considering that the genes arae <dig>  arad-araa1-ptk and arak-arae2-araa2-tal-tkt1-epi are related to l-arabinose metabolism
 <cit> , their up-regulation was expected to enable an improved l-arabinose utilization in the presence of d-glucose. to confirm this speculation, we investigated the 824ccpa and the 824wt in fermenting the mixture of d-glucose and l-arabinose. as shown in figure 
4a, compared to the 824wt, the 824ccpa exhibited a significantly enhanced l-arabinose consumption.

putative cre sites were identified in the promoter or orf regions of these d-xylose and l-arabinose pathway genes, including arae <dig>  xylb-cac2611-xyla, arad-araa1-ptk and arak-arae2-araa2-tal-tkt1-epi . to further determine whether ccpa can directly regulate these genes, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay  analysis. the dna fragments of xylb and arae <dig> promoter regions were chosen as the candidates. a substantial dna band shift was observed in both cases and typical protein concentration dependent binding trends were also observed . the band shift was suppressed with un-labelled dna competitor but not in the presence of same amount of non-specific competitor  . thus, the binding of ccpa to the promoter regions of xylb and arae <dig> will repress their transcription, resulting in inhibition of d-xylose and l-arabinose consumption when d-glucose was present . these results demonstrated that ccpa directly repressed the expression of genes xylb-cac2611-xyla and arae <dig>  which are key genes for d-xylose and l-arabinose utilization, respectively.

impact of ccpa in acidogenesis and solventogenesis
c. acetobutylicum possesses two distinct phases during the typical abe fermentation process: acidogenic phase when acetic acid and butyric acid are produced and secreted, and solventogenic phase when the acids are re-assimilated for the production of three chemicals 
 <cit> . due to the importance of these two physiological processes in abe production, increasing attentions have been paid to identify related structural genes  as well as some transcription factors 
 <cit> . in spite of these progresses, the regulatory mechanism underlying the acids secretion and solvents formation as well as their metabolic shift are still not well understood. our previous study in the 824ccpa strain revealed that ccpa inactivation issued a great impact on the solventogenesis
 <cit> . microarray analysis in this study showed that ccpa, besides mediating carbon catabolite repression in gram-positive bacteria, might be involved in regulation of acids and solvents formation as well as their shift in c. acetobutylicum. the sol operon , responsible for acids re-assimilation and alcohol production
 <cit> , gene abrb <dig>  an essential regulator for transition between acidogenic and solventogenic phase
 <cit> , and gene bukii, a second butyrate kinase related to butyrate formation
 <cit> , were all found to be regulated by ccpa. inactivation of ccpa gene resulted in obvious changes in acids and solvents forming as well as the transition of these two stages
 <cit> .

 ccpa inactivation caused down-regulation of the sol operon
the sol operon of c. acetobutylicum contains three genes, i.e., adhe <dig>  ctfa and ctfb, which are sequentially arranged and transcribed as a tri-cistron under the control of the adhe <dig> promoter and the operon has been found to play a key role in alcohol production and acid re-assimilation in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . microarray analysis showed that among the genes  concerned with branch pathways of solvents formation, only sol operon genes showed differential expression after ccpa inactivation . to further confirm expression changes of the sol operon, qrt-pcr analysis was performed. the samples were collected at m, t and s time points, representing the acidogenic exponential, acid-to-solvent transition and early solventogenic period , respectively. as shown in figure 
6c, significantly lower expression of sol operon was detected in the 824ccpa versus the 824wt, demonstrating that ccpa is required for normal expression of sol operon during both acidogenic and solventogenic phase. although no typical cre sites were found in the upstream region of sol operon, the emsa result showed that the ccpa protein was able to interact directly with the sol upstream region in vitro, and an apparent shift was observed when  <dig>  μm ccpa was used . the ccpa-dna binding appeared to be specific since no shift was observed in the presence of non-labeled specific competitor, and non-specific competitor  did not affect the ccpa-dna binding . therefore, it seems that there is an atypical ccpa-binding site inside the upstream region of sol operon.

it should be noted that, although ccpa inactivation lowered the transcriptional level of sol operon, the trend that the transcript of sol operon gradually increased from m to s phase was similar for the 824wt and 824ccpa strain , suggesting that some other factors might be involved in regulating sol expression. it has been known that the phosphorylated spo0a, a transcription factor, could activate the sol expression
 <cit> , and inactivation of the spo0a caused a deficient sol expression, resulting in a significant decrease in solvent formation
 <cit> . therefore, spo0a is considered as a “master controller” for solvent production in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . the previous observations in combination with the results in this study suggested that both ccpa and spo0a could regulate sol operon, which also explained why the sol operon was still efficiently induced in the 824ccpa strain . however, the interaction of ccpa and spo0a in regulating sol operon is still yet to be elucidated.

 ccpa is involved in glucose repression on bukii expression
c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> harbors two butyrate kinase  genes, namely buki  and bukii . the buki gene, together with ptb gene, forms an operon responsible for producing butyrate, a major organic acid in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . although in vitro butyrate kinase activity of bkii could be easily detected
 <cit> , its in vivo catalytic activity remained at a much lower level compared to that of bki
 <cit> . interestingly, microarray and qrt-pcr results here showed that ccpa inactivation caused a significant increase in transcriptional level of the bukii  and the expression of bukii was repressed by d-glucose in the 824wt . these observations indicated that bukii of c. acetobutylicum is a glucose-repressive gene and moreover, such a glucose repression is under ccpa-dependent control. however, no cre site was found in the upstream region or orf region of gene bukii, and the emsa result also showed no binding of ccpa to the bukii . therefore, it seems that gene bukii is not directly regulated by ccpa. in contrast, no change was detected in expression level of the buki-ptb operon after ccpa inactivation . therefore, the enhanced butyrate formation in the 824ccpa might be partly attributed to the up-regulation of the bukii. the up-regulated bukii expression in combination with the down-regulation of the sol operon  may result in excess butyrate accumulation as well as a consequent “acid crash” in the 824ccpa, and thereby, the 824ccpa required a ph adjustment during the fermentation process so as to live through the acidogenic period. once entering into the solventogenic period, the ability of the 824ccpa in acid re-assimilation and solvent production could be restored because of the gradually increased expression of the sol operon from then on . this also resulted in a comparable residual butyrate concentration of the 824ccpa and 824wt at the end of the fermentation .

bk -dependent butyrate formation is an atp-producing process in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . therefore, it is speculated that expression of the bukii is only efficiently activated when fermenting some non-preferable sugars  because, compared to d-glucose metabolism, a higher atp demand is required then
 <cit> . although it seems that gene bukii did not work when fermenting d-glucose, such a ccpa-dependent glucose repression on the bukii expression may be a significant regulatory mechanism for c. acetobutylicum to respond to different carbohydrate resources.

 ccpa controls abrb expression
gene abrb has been linked to regulation of the shift from exponential to stationary growth phase in b. subtilis <cit> . c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> harbors three abrb homologues, namely abrb <dig> , abrb <dig>  and abrb <dig> , and these three abrb protein are highly identical  to each other. according to microarray result and qrt-pcr validation, three abrb genes all exhibited different expression changes after ccpa inactivation : the expression levels of the abrb <dig> and abrb <dig> were significantly down-regulated during all four phases, while that of the abrb <dig> was only up-regulated in acidogenic phase. the previous study using antisense rna approach has showed that repression of the abrb <dig> expression resulted in a prolonged acidogenic period as well as delayed solvent formation in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . therefore, abrb <dig> is likely involved in regulation of the shift from acidogenesis to solventogenesis. however, the possible regulatory roles that abrb <dig> and abrb <dig> play as well as the relationship of these three abrb genes still need further investigation.

ccpa protein is required for efficient sporulation in c. acetobutylicum
a number of genes related to spore forming exhibited differential expression after ccpa inactivation in c. acetobutylicum. to further confirm the microarray result, we investigated sporulation formation of the 824ccpa and 824wt strains. after  <dig> d growth, the 824wt strain produced spores at  <dig> % while the 824ccpa did not produce any spores . when the growth time prolonged to  <dig> d, sporulation of the 824wt increased to ~100%, nearly  <dig> -fold that of the 824ccpa  , suggesting that ccpa is required for efficient sporulation in c. acetobutylicum.

it has been known that the phosphorylated form of spo0a protein, namely spo0a ~ p, is a key factor regulating sporulation process in c. acetobutylicum <cit> , and inactivation of spo0a blocked spore formation in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . three genes, encoding orphan histidine kinases , were suggested to be responsible for transferring phosphoryl group to spo0a
 <cit> . however, microarray result here showed that, of these three genes, only cac <dig> exhibited increased expression level after ccpa inactivation , which was contrary to the previous finding that inactivation of gene cac <dig> lowered sporulation to only 1% original level
 <cit> . therefore, whether these three orphan kinases played roles in ccpa-dependent regulation on sporulation still awaits further elucidation.

as mentioned above, three abrb genes  exhibited transcriptional changes after ccpa inactivation. it has been reported that abrb is a transcription factor involved in controlling the transition from vegetative growth to sporulation phase in b. subtilis <cit> . inactivation of the abrb gene significantly decreased sporulation in b. subtilis <cit> . similarly, it was found that inhibition of the abrb <dig> translation by using antisense rna techniques resulted in a delayed initiation of sporulation as well as the declined spore formation in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . in addition, abrb <dig> and abrb <dig> contain spo0a-binding box in their promoter regions
 <cit> . thus, it is speculative that down-regulation of abrb <dig> and abrb <dig> expression here may be one of the main reasons for deficient sporulation in c. acetobutylicum ccpa mutant.

the microarray result also showed that ccpa inactivation caused down-regulation of a set of genes encoding sporulation-specific sigma factors in c. acetobutylicum , including sige , sigg , sigk  and sigma factor e processing enzyme spoiiga  . this suggested that ccpa may be one of the higher level regulators for these sporulation-related sigma factors. early studies found that sige and sigf inactivation caused sporulation stalling in c. acetobutylicum <cit> . to further identify sporulation-related genes controlled by these sigma factors and ccpa in c. acetobutylicum, the well-established b. subtilis transcriptional regulation database, namely dbtbs 
 <cit> , was used here. most of the yielding genes exhibited down-regulation in the 824ccpa compare to the 824wt , including:  <dig> σe-controlled genes prka , yhbh , spoiiiaa-ah , spovd ;  <dig> σf-controlled genes sigg  and spoiig ;  <dig> σk-controlled genes cotf , cotf-related genes , cots , cots-related genes , yabg  and yhjr ;  <dig> σg-controlled genes spovae , spovad , sspa , sleb , spovt  and spovt homologue . among these genes, only a putative σg-controlled gene cac <dig> possesses an identifiable cre site , indicating that the majority of these sporulation-related genes may be indirectly regulated by ccpa. the result here also suggested that the σ-mediated spore formation processes in c. acetobutylicum may be similar with that in b. subtilis <cit> , and ccpa, as a key regulator, exerts a direct or cascade regulation on these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
c. acetobutylicum has been used for industrial-scale butanol production for many decades. although most of the relevant metabolic pathways have been deciphered, the complicated regulatory system in this strain remains unclear. in this study, we revealed the pleiotropic roles of a catabolite control protein ccpa in regulating several important physiological and biochemical processes in c. acetobutylicum, some of which are closely related to its industrial application. inactivation of ccpa led to global expression changes of the genes for carbohydrate uptake and metabolism. among the effects is the elimination of glucose repression on those non-preferable sugars. our results showed that c. acetobutylicum ccpa may mediate the glucose repression by directly repressing genes for metabolizing these non-preferable carbon sources such as d-xylose and l-arabinose. this study has also showed that ccpa is involved in regulation of acidogenesis and solventogenesis and the transition of these two phases. the transcription profile analysis revealed that the normal expression of three important genes and gene clusters  related to acid and solvent production as well as transition, were all affected by ccpa inactivation. in addition, the impact of ccpa to efficient sporulation also suggested that ccpa might be a relative upper-level regulator compared to those known sporulation-related factors  in c. acetobutylicum. these findings not only improved our understanding of regulatory roles ccpa plays in solventogenic clostridia, but also provided some useful information for further genetic improvement of c. acetobutylicum.
