BACKGROUND
laccases , together with ferroxidases , ascorbate oxidase  and ceruloplasmin  belong to the multi-copper oxidase  enzyme family. these enzymes are classified as blue copper proteins and contain between one and six copper atoms. they are produced by various fungi, plants, insects and bacteria  <cit> . they catalyze the oxidation of a range of organic substances via a four-electron reduction of oxygen to water  <cit> .

laccase catalyzed reactions include the polymerization of monomers, degradation of polymers and the oxidation of phenolic compounds  <cit> . laccases can act on non-phenolic compounds by employing mediators, which undergo an oxidation-reduction cycle, thus shuttling electrons between the non-phenolic compound and the enzyme. these laccase mediator systems  have been used in a number of processes including pulp delignification and oxidation of organic pollutants  <cit> .

besides being commercially used in denim bleaching, laccases have also been applied in the decolorization and transformation of textile dyes. dye effluents from the textile industry represent a major environmental pollutant, and conventional degradation processes suffer from inefficiency, are not price competitive or result in toxic by-products  <cit> .

numerous studies have shown that laccase catalyzed decolorization of textile dyes was achieved either by direct oxidation or via indirect oxidation using mediators, which enhanced or enabled the reaction  <cit> . preferably, mediators should be good laccase substrates, stable in oxidized and reduced form and have no inhibitory effect upon enzyme activity. once oxidized, mediators interact between the active site of the enzyme and the target molecule, thus broadening the range of substrates which can be oxidized. well established non-natural laccase mediators are abts, tempo  and hbt . however, the emphasis on natural mediators has gained momentum due to economic and ecological awareness  <cit> .

to date, only fungal laccases are industrially relevant for the detoxification of synthetic dyes and other applications owing to their higher redox potential compared to bacterial laccases  <cit> . however, more recently bacterial laccases have also been shown to successfully oxidize dyes in the presence and absence of redox mediators  <cit> . developing bacterial laccases for biotechnological applications will be advantageous because they are sustainable and can be produced in a short time in inexpensive media. fungal laccases suffer from several drawbacks, such as lack of functional or efficient expression in heterologous hosts, relatively long fermentation times and comparatively low yield. furthermore, as bacterial laccases are suitable for heterologous expression in e. coli, the enzyme can easily be tailored using techniques such as directed evolution  <cit> . based on the intrinsic properties of bacterial laccases, these enzymes have great potential as biocatalysts for oxidation reactions, as they operate in aqueous solvent at neutral to basic ph, are temperature stable, cofactor-independent and produce water as a sole by-product  <cit> .

the endospore coat protein cota from bacillus subtilis is a well-studied thermostable bacterial laccase which has been crystallized. it is believed to play a role in the biosynthesis of the brown spore pigment, which might be involved in the uv light protection of the spore coat  <cit> . cota contains a four-copper active site with the type  <dig> blue copper centre t <dig> and the t2/t <dig> trinuclear cluster   <cit> . the one electron oxidation of the substrate to the corresponding radical takes place at the t <dig> site and the abstracted electron is transferred to the trinuclear centre, where dioxygen is reduced to water  <cit> . other bacterial laccases have been described in azospirillum lipoferum, escherichia coli, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus halodurans, streptomyces coelicolor, thermus thermophilus and γ-proteobacterium jb, to mention the most relevant examples  <cit> . bacterial laccases are characterized by their high temperature tolerance and high levels of activity in neutral to alkaline conditions, whereas fungal laccases usually operate under acidic ph.

we have identified a cota-type laccase from bacillus pumilus by genome mining which differed by over 30% in its amino acid sequence from the b. subtilis laccase. we cloned the corresponding gene, purified the protein and characterized it biochemically. the purified laccase was tested for its ability to decolorize indigocarmine , a compound belonging to the group of carbonyl dyes which are widely used in the industrial production of denim. the decolorization of this dye remains challenging and enzymatic decolorization using the laccase directly or as lms has great potential.

methods
materials
 <dig> '-azino-bis , 4-hydroxy- <dig> -dimethoxybenzaldehyde azine ,  <dig> -dimethoxyphenol , 3', 5'-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxyacetophenone ) and indigocarmine  were purchased from sigma-aldrich. all other chemicals were standard reagent grade .

bacterial strains and plasmids
b. pumilus dsm  <dig> was obtained from the german collection of microorganisms . e. coli strain jm <dig>  and the pqe- <dig> expression vector were purchased from promega  and qiagen , respectively. the origin of replication in pqe- <dig> is cole <dig>  and transcription of the inserted gene is controlled by the bacteriophage t <dig> promoter  and two lac operator sequences . for efficient repression the host strain jm <dig> which over-expresses the repressor laci was used.

b. pumilus was grown overnight at 30°c and  <dig> rpm in srb medium . e. coli was routinely grown in lb medium at 37°c and  <dig> rpm. for plasmid selection  <dig>  mg/ml ampicillin was added to lb agar plates and liquid medium.

cloning of the b. pumilus laccase gene
the putative laccase gene  of b. pumilus was identified by protein blast  using the cota sequence of b. subtilis as search template . the cota gene of b. pumilus  was pcr amplified from genomic dna with forward primer 5'- cgt cc atg gaa aac cta gaa aaa ttt gtt gac gag c -3'  and reverse primer 5'- ccatg aagctt tta ctg gat gat atc cat cgg c-3' . pcr was performed with high fidelity phusion polymerase  and appropriately diluted cell suspension of b. pumilus dsm  <dig> as template. the  <dig> bp pcr product was cloned into the high copy number cloning vector pjet/blunt  by blunt end ligation. after sequence verification the  <dig> bp ncoi-cota-hindiii fragment of pjet/blunt-cota was sub-cloned into the ncoi and hindiii sites present in the multiple cloning site of pqe- <dig>  resulting in plasmid pbpl <dig>  the ncoi site of pqe- <dig> contains the start codon for expression of cloned genes. in order to obtain fully wild-type cota of b. pumilus the additional glutamate codon introduced at position  <dig> for cloning purposes was removed from pbpl <dig> by quick change mutagenesis using forward primer 5'-gaggagaaattaacc atg aac cta gaa aaa ttt gtt gac-3' and complementary reverse primer 5'-gtc aac aaa ttt ttc tag gtt cat ggttaatttctcctc-3'. a map of the final expression plasmid pbpl <dig> containing the cota gene as confirmed by dna sequencing is shown in the additional file  <dig> 

cota production
e. coli jm <dig> was transformed with pbpl <dig> for expression and purification of b. pumilus laccase.

to obtain a fully copper loaded enzyme, the method reported by durao et al.  <dig> was used for cota production  <cit> . briefly, the recombinant e. coli strain was cultivated in tb medium supplemented with  <dig>  mg/ml ampicillin at 30°c and  <dig> rpm. starting from an isolated colony, an overnight pre-culture was diluted 1: <dig> into a  <dig> ml volume in a  <dig> l erlenmeyer flask. at an optical density of 1- <dig> , laccase expression was induced by adding  <dig>  mm iptg. at the same time,  <dig>  mm cucl <dig> was added and the temperature was decreased to 25°c. the cells were further incubated for  <dig> h at  <dig> rpm and then without shaking for additional  <dig> hours. durao et al.  showed that static incubation improved the cellular copper content, thus yielding a fully copper loaded protein population. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°c for  <dig> min at  <dig>  × g, washed in  <dig> mm tris buffer ph  <dig> , centrifuged again and subsequently stored at -20°c.

frozen cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in  <dig> mm tris buffer ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> mg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitor mix  and re-frozen at -80°c. cells were thawed, benzonase® nuclease  was added and the suspension incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c at  <dig> rpm. the suspension was subjected to twelve  <dig> s rounds of sonication with a branson sonicator equipped with a microtip at a setting of 80%. cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4°c for  <dig> min,  <dig>  × g. the crude cell lysate was incubated at 70°c for  <dig> min and soluble protein was collected by centrifugation at 4°c for  <dig> min and  <dig>  × g. purification was performed on an Äkta purifier fplc system . the sample was loaded onto a  <dig> ml q-sepharose ff anion exchange chromatography column , previously equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris buffer ph  <dig> . proteins were eluted with a nacl gradient from  <dig> to  <dig> m. fractions displaying laccase activity, as detected using an abts oxidation assay, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a  <dig> kda cut-off. the sample was loaded onto a superdex  <dig> column , previously equilibrated with  <dig> mm tris buffer containing  <dig>  m nacl ph  <dig> . fractions with laccase activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored in  <dig> mm tris buffer ph  <dig>  at -80°c. the purity of the sample was analyzed by sds-page using a 10% polyacrylamide gel. the copper content was determined by icp-oes  on a perkin elmer optima  <dig> instrument. the protein solution was treated with nitric acid in a microwave digestion system prior to optical analysis at cu lines  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm.

determination of protein and enzyme activities
total protein concentration was determined by the method of bradford  <cit>  with bovine serum albumin  as standard and by uv-vis absorbance measurements with a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer using an extinction coefficient of  <dig>  m-1cm- <dig> .

spectrophotometric laccase activity assays were routinely carried out in a 96-well plate at 25°c with  <dig>  mm abts in mcilvaine buffer at ph  <dig>  using a varian cary  <dig> bio or a bio tek synergy mx spectrophotometer and initiated by adding enzyme solution. the assay volume was either  <dig> or  <dig> μl.

oxidation of abts was monitored at  <dig> nm , of sgz at  <dig> nm  and of  <dig> -dmp at  <dig> nm . laccase activity as a function of ph was performed in mcilvaine buffer in the ph range 2- <dig> for abts , sgz  and  <dig> -dmp . the temperature optimum was recorded between 20°c and 75°c by following abts or  <dig> -dmp oxidation in an assay volume of  <dig> ml using a magnetically stirred, temperature controlled cuvette device. the effect of dmso on laccase activity was determined by adding  <dig> -50%  of solvent to the reaction mixture and following the oxidation of abts, sgz or  <dig> -dmp. the stability of laccase was tested by incubating the enzyme in mcilvaine buffer at ph  <dig> or  <dig>  potassium phosphate buffer ph  <dig> and in ddh2o at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 65°c and subsequently performing an abts assay.

kinetic parameters of purified laccase were determined in mcilvaine buffer at 25°c against abts ,  <dig> -dmp  and sgz  dmso, ph  <dig> ). enzymatic assays were performed in triplicate. oxidation of acs was monitored at  <dig> nm by the decrease of substrate absorbance  in  <dig>  m potassium phosphate buffer . the initial rates, recorded within  <dig> to  <dig> min, were approximated by non-linear regression algorithms according to the michaelis-menten equation using sigma-plot enzyme kinetics software. one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidized  <dig> μmol of substrate per minute.

substrate/mediator screening and ic decolorization
purified laccase was subjected to a substrate screening. the screening was based on the direct oxidation of the substrate and on the coupled decolorization of ic. therefore, potential laccase substrates were dissolved in water and 5%  dmso at a concentration of  <dig> mm and diluted to a final concentration of  <dig> mm. reactions were performed in 96-well plates in  <dig>  m potassium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig>  or  <dig>  at 37°c with shaking. the reaction was initiated by adding  <dig>  u/ml purified laccase. one unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidized  <dig> μmol of abts per minute at room temperature. a uv-vis scan between 230- <dig> nm was recorded prior to laccase addition and after  <dig> hours reaction time.

to evaluate the ability of the purified laccase to decolorize ic,  <dig> mm of the dye was dissolved in water and incubated with  <dig>  mm of the potential mediator substrate. the reaction was initiated by the addition of laccase which was substituted with water in the control reaction. the reaction was followed over a period of  <dig> h at intervals of  <dig> min and was performed at 37°c. the change in absorbance  was recorded to follow ic decolorization. although ic showed a maximum absorbance at  <dig> nm, decolorization was calculated based on the shoulder at  <dig> nm. in this way it was possible to follow starting concentrations of  <dig> mm as the lambert-beer law was still valid under these conditions. furthermore, no by-product was detected at  <dig> nm as opposed to  <dig> nm. the decolorization was further assessed by varying the ic to acs ratio in the presence and absence of laccase.

decolorization  was calculated based on the difference in absorbance at  <dig> nm in reactions with and without laccase and defined as:

 decolorization=100−absorbancet48_laccase×100absorbancet48_control 

decolorization reactions were carried out in the presence and in the absence of laccase. the absorbance measured after  <dig> h in reactions lacking laccase was then defined as 100% .

RESULTS
cloning of cota from bacillus pumilus
a protein blast search for uncharacterized bacterial laccases was performed using the cota amino acid sequence of bacillus subtilis as template. out of numerous homologues, a hypothetical protein annotated as "spore coat protein a" found in the fully sequenced genome of bacillus pumilus atcc  <dig> was selected for cloning and recombinant expression in e. coli due to its relatively close relation to other already characterized bacillus laccases. the b. pumilus dsm  <dig> sequence encoding a cota-like protein was cloned into the expression vector pqe- <dig> as described in methods. the cloned sequence exhibited  <dig> % amino acid identity to the cota sequence of b. pumilus atcc <dig>  with k79e being the only difference. cota of b. pumilus dsm  <dig> exhibited 68% amino acid identity and 79% similarity to cota of b. subtilis, which is the best studied bacterial laccase  <cit> . amino acid identity and similarity to the second previously characterized cota laccase from b. licheniformis atcc  <dig>  was 62% and 76%, respectively. cota of b. pumilus consists of  <dig> amino acids , which is close to the length of  <dig> amino acids for both the b. subtilis and b. licheniformis laccases. the ligands which bind t <dig> copper , t <dig> copper  and t <dig> copper  in b. subtilis cota  <cit>  were all conserved in b. pumilus cota. the cysteine residues c <dig> and c <dig> which have been proposed to form a disulfide bond in b. subtilis cota  <cit>  were also conserved in b. pumilus cota.

recombinant expression and purification cota laccase
for production of b. pumilus laccase with e. coli jm <dig>  special growth and induction procedures were applied which had been described previously  <cit> . similarly to b. subtilis cota, the use of reduced cultivation temperature before and after induction, the addition of high concentrations of cu2+ at induction and static incubation in the second phase of cota expression as stated in materials and methods yielded maximal amounts of fully copper-loaded, active b. pumilus enzyme.

the supernatant from cells expressing laccase was incubated at 70°c for  <dig> min, as described for other bacillus laccases expressed in e. coli  <cit> . this treatment results in denaturation of most e. coli proteins and is used to enrich heat resistant proteins such as spore-coat associated laccases. above 90% of the initial laccase activity was recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation of heat-treated lysate. subsequent column purifications included anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, yielding a single protein band of approximately  <dig> kda, as shown by sds-page analysis in figure  <dig>  the apparent molecular weight of the expressed laccase was much lower than the expected one of approximately  <dig> kda, when proteins were separated by sds-page under standard conditions . however, when the protein was boiled for  <dig> min, the band migrated at the expected molecular weight, suggesting that full denaturation of the protein required extra heat.

biochemical properties of b. pumilus laccase cota
purified protein samples showed a strong blue color, and copper content determination revealed a molar copper to protein ratio of  <dig> , affirming a fully copper-loaded enzyme. the ph optima of cota activity were determined to be around ph  <dig> for abts, ph  <dig> for  <dig> -dmp and ph  <dig>  for sgz. these values were very similar to those found for other bacillus cota laccases  <cit> . the temperature optimum for abts oxidation was determined to be between 55-75°c. for  <dig> -dmp oxidation a steady increase of activity up to 70°c was monitored, again demonstrating the high temperature tolerance of cota laccase. for detailed temperature-activity and ph-activity profiles see additional file  <dig> 

kinetic parameters of recombinant b. pumilus laccase for abts,  <dig> -dmp and sgz oxidation were determined and are shown in table  <dig>  michaelis-menten plots for all substrates are given in additional file  <dig>  the values obtained for abts and  <dig> -dmp were more similar to those obtained for b. subtilis than for b. licheniformis laccase  <cit> . it was not possible to determine the kinetic parameters for sgz due to its low solubility. the observed kinetics did not fit a michaelis-menten equation. instead, only a linear correlation was observed. this was true either when low sgz  and dmso concentrations  or high sgz  and dmso  concentrations were used. hence, no km can be given for sgz oxidation. nevertheless, a rough estimate of kcat was deduced from the highest observed reaction rates measured with either <  <dig> %  or 25%  dmso .

substrate ranges covered, ph and temperature are listed. n.m.: not measurable, due to substrate solubility. * the value was deduced from the highest observed rate.

sgz required the presence of dmso to enable its solubility. the effect of increasing concentrations of dmso upon laccase activity was therefore investigated. to this end, abts,  <dig> -dmp and sgz oxidations were measured in the presence of increasing dmso concentrations . it was found that sgz oxidation rates were enhanced with increasing concentrations of dmso with an optimum at around 25% . concentrations above 50%  did not result in further enhanced activity, but rather deactivated the enzyme rapidly . for abts and  <dig> -dmp any addition of dmso led to a gradually decreased oxidation rate; however, the effect was much more severe for abts.

the kinetic stability upon storage of the enzyme was also investigated. protein samples were incubated in mcilvaine buffer at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  potassium phosphate buffer at ph  <dig> and ddh2o at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 65°c. abts oxidation was measured periodically. the half-life of laccase is summarized in table  <dig>  within  <dig> hour, all laccase preparations in mcilvaine buffer ph  <dig> showed over 75% loss of activity. enzyme samples stored in either mcilvaine or phosphate buffer at ph  <dig> showed over 50% loss in activity after  <dig> h. unexpectedly, this significant loss was not detected for the samples stored in deionized water.

the purified protein was stored in different solvents and at various temperatures. half-lives are given in hours.

substrate range of b. pumilus laccase cota
the catalytic activity of purified cota was screened against a panel of  <dig> structurally different potential substrates of both synthetic and natural origin. the activity was measured at a substrate concentration of  <dig> mm. a uv-vis scanning between 230- <dig> nm was recorded prior to laccase addition and after  <dig> h reaction time. by this method only substrates leading to a changed uv spectrum upon oxidation were detectable. from the  <dig> compounds tested, a change of absorbance was detected for  <dig> compounds . control reactions lacking laccase were performed in parallel, to exclude the possibility of non-enzymatic oxidation.

indigocarmine decolorization   is given compared to the control reaction lacking laccase.

in addition, all substrates were tested for their ability to function as mediator in the decolorization of the dye ic . the relative decrease of absorbance was determined spectrophotometrically as a measure of the degree of mediated oxidation of ic. for the mediator screen,  <dig> mm ic was combined with  <dig>  mm of the substrate. the results are summarized in table  <dig> 

amongst the  <dig> compounds tested,  <dig> showed a change of absorbance as a result of laccase promoted oxidation. in turn, three of these compounds, abts , acs  and syringaldehyde  functioned as mediators and completely decolorized ic within  <dig> hours. within  <dig> hours, two compounds promoted decolorization of 25%  and 40% , respectively. laccase alone lead to a decolorization of 20% within  <dig> hours at ph  <dig> . all other compounds did not lead to a decolorization of more than 20% and therefore cannot be considered as mediators for ic oxidation.

acs was selected for further studies and its potential as a mediator for the decolorization of ic was evaluated. in the screening, experiments were conducted with  <dig>  mm acs and  <dig> mm ic . this ratio was decreased to 1: <dig>  and 1: <dig>  with ic starting concentrations of  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm, respectively. furthermore, the ph effect was evaluated by performing the reactions at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . direct decolorization of ic by laccase was monitored in reactions lacking acs.

both mediated and non-mediated reactions were more efficient at higher ph. although ic was partially  and completely  decolorized by laccase alone within  <dig> h, the mediated reactions proceeded faster, most notably at ic:acs ratio of 1: <dig>  it was found that mediated reactions at ic:acs ratio of 1: <dig> completely decolorized ic at both ph values. however, at ic:acs ratio of 1: <dig>  only reactions at ph  <dig>  were completed. independently of the ph, the rates of acs mediated reactions performed at an ic:acs ratio of 1: <dig> and non-mediated reactions were almost the same. this indicated that acs concentrations significantly below the km, which was determined to be  <dig> mm, had no influence on the reaction kinetics.

decolorization reactions were also conducted with  <dig> mm ic and 1: <dig> and 1: <dig> ratios of ic:acs at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . as a control, direct oxidation was monitored in reactions lacking acs. although the initial absorbance could not be detected spectrophotometrically , complete decolorization within  <dig> hours was observed for the reaction performed at an ic:acs ratio of 1: <dig> and ph  <dig> . no measurable bleaching was observed for the non-mediated reaction or any of the other control reactions conducted. in reactions which lead to complete decolorization of ic at λ =  <dig> nm, a red soluble reaction product with an absorbance maximum at λ =  <dig> nm was formed. the formation of a red product during laccase-catalyzed ic transformation has previously been reported and presumably is due to the condensation of two ic molecules  <cit> .

discussion
laccases are versatile biocatalysts for industrial applications. much research has been done with fungal laccases; however, recently more information has become available also for bacterial laccases  <cit> . we have identified a novel cota-type laccase by homology searches in public protein databases. the laccase from bacillus pumilus dsm  <dig> was cloned, purified and biochemically characterized. the purified fully copper loaded protein was found to be a monomeric  <dig> kda recombinant protein, which exhibited a blue color, due to the characteristic absorbance of the chelated t <dig> copper site at  <dig> nm  <cit> .

laccase from b. pumilus constitutes a highly thermostable protein. the ph optimum for abts,  <dig> -dmp and sgz, as well as the temperature optimum between 55-75°c were similar to b. subtilis and b. licheniformis laccases  <cit> . thermal stability studies showed that our laccase maintained activity best when stored in water. therefore, selection of the appropriate storage solvent seems to be crucial for bacillus laccases in order to maintain high levels of active protein for either storage or in biotransformation reactions.

kinetic constants for abts and  <dig> -dmp were within the range of data reported for b. subtilis and compared favorably to that of fungal laccases  <cit> . however, the km for sgz was not measurable and a kcat value of  <dig> s- <dig> could only be estimated from the highest observed reaction rate at  <dig>  mm sgz and 25%  dmso. the initial rate of sgz oxidation was highest when the reaction mixture was supplemented with 25%  dmso. by contrast, any addition of dmso to reactions performed with abts and  <dig> -dmp lead to an immediate decline of activity, probably due partial denaturation or inhibition of the enzyme. in the case of sgz, the increased solubility of the substrate at increasing dmso concentrations presumably over-compensates negative effects of the co-solvent. an inhibitory effect of dmso on laccase catalyzed oxidation of  <dig> -dmp has been previously reported for an enzyme from pyricularia oryzae  <cit> . increasing amounts of dmso were also added to laccase from trametes sp. and the conversion of 4-hydroxybiphenyl decreased with increasing dmso concentrations. however, the study was only carried out for dmso concentrations between  <dig> to 70%, as the substrate was not soluble below 30%  <cit> . we conclude from our data that dmso up to 25%  can be used as a co-solvent for enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic substrates in biotransformations with cota-type laccases.

to explore the potential of laccase as a biocatalyst a substrate screen for  <dig> non-comprehensive compounds was performed. both, different substituted phenols and non-phenolic substrates were tested qualitatively. it was found that purified laccase from b. pumilus exhibited a broad substrate spectrum. oxidizing activity towards  <dig> compounds was detected, which was in many cases accompanied by the associated color formation. no activity was detected for the non-phenolic substrates  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which might be due to the lack of a changed spectroscopic signal upon oxidation. however, it was observed that phenolic substrates were preferably oxidized when at least one -oh or -och <dig> with a lone pair of electrons was adjacent to the phenol, such as substrates  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  for substrates  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  no activity could be detected, although one ortho position was substituted with an -och <dig>  for these compounds to function as substrates, a substitution at both ortho positions might be vital. kinetic studies with a number of basidomycetes suggested that the higher activity for sinapic acid compared to ferulic acid could be the result of the additional -och <dig> group  <cit> . a similar correlation between activity and substitution pattern has been described for laccase from trametes trogii, streptomyces ipomoea, pleurotus ostreatus and b. licheniformis  <cit> . the fact that the ortho -h or -ch <dig> substituted substrates  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were not oxidized is in line with the proposed requirement for the aforementioned substitution pattern. the oxidizing activity of laccase might be rationalized based on the principle of inductive and mesomeric effects. the substrate screen revealed that the enzyme preferably oxidizes substituted phenols with at least one ortho - or para - substituent bearing a lone pair of electrons, contributing to the positive mesomeric effect. as a consequence, the electron density at the phenoxy-oh is increased, thus facilitating an electron abstraction that yields a phenoxy radical. compound  <dig> is not oxidized because the negative inductive effect of halogens such as fluorine is dominating over the positive mesomeric effect.

the substrates were also tested for their potential to act as mediator in the ic decolorization. for three compounds, namely abts , syringaldehyde  and acs , a complete decolorization was achieved using lms with b. pumilus laccase. a number of groups have reported on the direct or mediated ic decolorization using bacterial as well as fungal laccase  <cit> . routinely, reactions were carried out using 20- <dig> μm ic in combination with various mediators that were added in equimolar amounts or in a molar ratio of 1: <dig>  successfully employed mediators, which led to best decolorization results, were syringaldehyde, acetosyringone and violuric acid. a true mediator should be added in catalytic amounts. yet, in most studies on dye decolorization the mediators are added in high stoichiometric amounts. in our study, we reduced the mediator to dye ratio to 1: <dig> and found that acs functioned as a "true" mediator, which significantly enhanced the decolorization rate. only three of the  <dig> substrates tested functioned as mediators for the decolorization of ic. the other identified primary substrates might still function as mediators for the oxidation of other dyes/secondary substrates.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, laccase from b. pumilus was cloned, expressed and biochemically characterized. it was shown to constitute a versatile biocatalyst and was successfully applied in the decolorization of up to  <dig> mm ic in the presence of catalytic amounts of mediators. we concluded that cota from b. pumilus has great potential as biocatalyst due to its thermo stability, ph optimum in the neutral to alkaline range and broad substrate spectrum.
