BACKGROUND
the maternal-zygotic transition is a critical event in early mouse embryogenesis. this transition transforms the highly differentiated oocyte into a totipotent blastomere, and is complete by the two-cell stage. during this transition, maternal mrnas are degraded and the embryonic genome is activated  <cit> . genome activation results in the replacement of transcripts common to both the oocyte and the embryo and the generation of new transcripts necessary for further development. development of mouse embryos unable to accomplish genome activation is terminated at the two-cell stage.

in the mouse, two transcriptional stages have been identified: a minor transcriptional wave at the one-cell stage, and a second major wave at the two-cell stage  <cit> . these findings are supported by the results of experiments showing that the one-cell stage features significant rna polymerase ii -dependent incorporation of bromouridine triphosphate  into rna, and rna synthesis is accompanied by an obvious increase in brutp incorporation at the two-cell stage. brutp uptake during the one-cell stage is only 40% of that at the two-cell stage. the higher levels of brutp incorporation seen at the two-cell stage are maintained at subsequent developmental stages  <cit> .

in eukaryotes, pol ii is responsible for transcription of mrna and most small nuclear rnas. transcription of class ii genes requires the coordinated assembly of pol ii and six general transcription factors; these are tfiia, tfiib, tfiid, tfiie, tfiif, and tfiih  <cit> . transcriptional initiation commences with formation of the first phosphodiester bond and phosphorylation of serine  <dig>   in the c-terminal domain  of the largest subunit of pol ii. the ctd of pol ii, composed of a highly conserved tandemly repeated heptapeptide motif , undergoes extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during the transcription cycle. pol ii exists primarily in two major forms; specifically, with an unphosphorylated ctd  and with an extensively phosphorylated  ctd, designated the hyperphosphorylated form. the ctd of pol ii is a major target of cdk <dig> kinase activity, and the distinct phosphorylation states of the enzyme are associated with different functionalities. this oscillation of ctd phosphorylation regulates recruitment of various factors required throughout transcription  <cit> .

positive transcription elongation factor b , also termed cdk9/cyclin t <dig>  the metazoan pol ii ctd kinase, regulates transcription elongation by phosphorylating ser <dig> of the ctd and negative elongation factor-e   <cit> . phosphorylation of nelf-e removes the block against early transcriptional elongation induced by binding of the nelf complex to the nascent transcript  <cit> . within the cell, p-tefb exists in two forms, designated the large and the free forms  <cit> . the kinase-active free form contains cdk <dig> and one of several cyclin regulatory subunits , with cyclin t <dig> being predominant in many cell types  <cit> . the kinase-inactive large form of p-tefb additionally contains 7sk rna  <cit>  and either hexamethylene bisacetamide-induced protein  <dig>   <cit>  or hexim <dig>  <cit> . in hela cells, 50-90% of p-tefb exists as the large form, with the remaining protein being in the kinase-active free form  <cit> . it is hypothesized that the large form of p-tefb serves as a reservoir for the free form.

phosphorylation of the ctd plays a further important role in co-transcriptional mrna processing in vivo. specifically, the phosphorylated protein serves as a binding platform for factors involved in 5' end capping, splicing, and 3' end-processing of pre-mrna, as well as chromatin modification  <cit> .

p-tefb is required for transcription of most genes, including heat-shock genes and c-myc, and also for hiv- <dig> transcription by tat  <cit> . shim et al.  reported that p-tefb was, in general, essential for expression of early embryonic genes in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . additionally, ser <dig> phosphorylation is eliminated upon genetic inactivation of cdk <dig> or its cyclin t <dig> subunit. c. elegans development is arrested at the 100-cell stage in the absence of cyclin t <dig> or cdk9; this is precisely what is noted upon knockdown of the large subunit of pol ii. experiments using yeast and drosophila have shown that cdk <dig> is vital for all of appropriate 3' end-processing of pre-mrna  <cit> , gene expression, histone methylation, and elongation factor recruitment  <cit> .

flavopiridol is a potent anti-cancer and -hiv therapeutic agent currently under investigation in clinical trials  <cit> . this compound is the most potent inhibitor of p-tefb identified to date and the first reported cdk inhibitor that acts in a manner that is not competitive with atp  <cit> . flavopiridol inhibits transcriptional elongation in vitro by targeting cdk9; the ic <dig> value of this effect is 5-10-fold lower than that noted when effects on other cdks are assessed  <cit> . nuclear run-on transcription assays have shown that flavopiridol inactivates p-tefb and blocks most pol ii-mediated transcription in vivo  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, the expression patterns and subcellular localization of cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> in mammalian oocytes and preimplantation embryos have not been investigated. herein, we show, for the first time, that both cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> are present in pre-ovulatory mouse oocytes, through to the blastocyst stage. we further explore the effects of a cdk9-specific inhibitor, flavopiridol, on mouse embryo preimplantation development and cdk <dig> localization in early embryos.

RESULTS
cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> in oocytes and embryos
to determine if antibodies against cdk <dig> or cyclin t <dig> specifically recognized the corresponding antigens in mouse embryos, we conducted a binding competition assay in which the antigen peptides were separately incubated with the appropriate antibodies prior to immunofluorescence staining. two-cell embryos were stained with antibody against either cdk <dig> or cyclin t <dig> alone, or the antibody-peptide mixture, and compared. figure 1a shows that cdk <dig> or cyclin t <dig> peptide completely blocked the binding of the corresponding antibody and abolished the signal therefrom, thus indicating that each antibody was specific. next, cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> levels were quantitated in mouse embryos. both cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> were maternally present in mouse pre-ovulatory oocytes . signal from antibody recognizing the cdk <dig> protein was detected in all growing and fully grown germinal vesicle oocytes including both nsn and sn configurations, and was predominantly nuclear in location. however, only a faint nucleo-cytoplasmic signal from antibody against cyclin t <dig> was evident in these oocytes. both cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> were weakly detected in the cytoplasm of mature oocytes. after fertilization, both proteins were present at all stages of preimplantation development . shortly after fertilization, cyclin t <dig> remained in the cytoplasm but increased in both pronuclei at the late one-cell stage whereas cdk <dig> translocated to nuclei at the mid one-cell stage. in the majority of instances , signal from cdk <dig> protein was more intense in the male pronucleus. the strongest signal from cdk <dig> was observed in late two-cell-stage embryonic nuclei . cyclin t <dig> became predominantly localized to the nucleus only at the late two-cell stage. subsequently, nuclear distribution of cyclin t <dig> was detected at all stages. after blastocyst formation, signals from cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> fell rapidly in intensity. in all stages examined, both cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> were dissociated from mitotic chromosomes . figure 1c showed a representative mitotic status of one nucleus in 4-cell embryo.

subcellular localization of pol ii phosphoisoforms in the fertilized embryo
ctd phosphorylation status and subcellular localization were examined at the time of cdk <dig> nuclear accumulation in fertilized eggs, using monoclonal antibodies recognizing hypo-, ser2-, and ser5-phosphorylated pol ii ctd. the monoclonal antibody h <dig> recognizes phosphorylated ser <dig> residues within the heptapeptide repeats of the ctd, generated via tfiih activity and required for transcription initiation. the transition from initiating to elongating pol ii complexes occurs when cdk <dig> phosphorylates ser <dig> residues within the ctd heptads, and the monoclonal antibody h <dig> recognizes these phosphorylated epitopes. all three phosphoforms of the ctd were present in both paternal and maternal pronuclei shortly after pronuclear formation . the nuclear concentration of both ser2p and ser5p increased following pronuclear formation, and this rise continued during the course of the first cell cycle. in addition, the concentrations of both phosphoforms were greater in the male pronucleus in all zygotes examined. correspondingly, a fall in the level of pronuclear hypophosphorylated ctd was evident following pronucleus formation.

effects of flavopiridol on embryo development
to ascertain whether cdk <dig> was involved in embryo development, we examined the influence of a specific inhibitor, flavopiridol, on in vitro development of mouse embryos by addition of the compound to culture medium at one-cell  and late two-cell or early four-cell  stages. to establish the minimum effective drug concentration, we compared the effects of various doses of flavopiridol on embryo development. one-cell embryos were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations  of flavopiridol. in the absence of the drug, all pronuclear zygotes developed to the two-cell stage after  <dig> h of culture and 81% of embryos reached the blastocyst stage after  <dig> h . development to the two-cell stage was slightly reduced upon addition of increasing concentrations of flavopiridol. with  <dig> nm drug, only a small proportion  of embryos reached the 8/16-cell stage and none developed beyond this step. in the presence of  <dig> nm flavopiridol, the majority of embryos stopped developing at the two-cell stage and none reached the four-cell stage. at the higher concentrations examined, at least 80% of zygotes completed first mitosis. accordingly, we concluded that  <dig> nm was the minimum effective concentration of flavopiridol inhibiting cdk <dig> activity in the embryo. next, late two-cell/early four-cell embryos were treated with this concentration of flavopiridol to determine the effects of cdk <dig> inhibition on embryo development beyond the two-cell stage. in the presence of  <dig> nm flavopiridol, most  late 2-cell embryos developed to the 8/16-cell stage and 20% reached to blastocyst . at the same concentration, 92% of early 4-cell embryos divided to 8/16-cell embryos and 56% formed blastocysts. at 3-fold increased concentration of flavopiridol, 51% of late-2-cell embryos developed to 8/16-cell stage and 8% formed blastocysts. at this concentration, 58% of early 4-cell embryos divided to 8/ <dig> cell and 10% formed blastocysts. these suggest that the developmental arrest observed at the two-cell stage may not attributable to a cytotoxic action of flavopiridol or to other drug effects, such as inhibition of other cdks, including cdk <dig> or cdk <dig>  our results clearly indicated that treatment with a cdk <dig> inhibitor from the early one-cell stage caused embryos to arrest at the two-cell stage, suggesting the involvement of cdk <dig> in transition of embryos from the two- to the four-cell stage.

effects of flavopiridol on localization of cdk9/cyclin t <dig> and pol ii
to clarify the effects of inhibition of cdk <dig> kinase activity on the subcellular status of cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig>  embryos were immunostained after  <dig> h of treatment with flavopiridol in vitro. impairment of nuclear localization of both proteins following drug treatment was clearly evident . to determine the effect of inhibition of cdk <dig> by flavopiridol, we conducted immunofluorescence labeling of the pol ii ctd. our immunostaining experiments revealed that, at the two-cell stage, flavopiridol-treated embryos showed obviously aberrant nuclear localization of all forms of pol ii ctd . in control two-cell embryos, the ser2p, ser5p and unp ctd were distributed uniformly throughout the nucleoplasm, excluding the nucleolar area. in contrast, in flavopiridol-treated two-cell embryos, ser2p and ser5p ctd were concentrated into uneven, dot-like structures. unp ctd also showed a different distribution in flavopiridol-treated two-cell embryos compared with that of control embryos. it seems that unp ctd was accumulated in some parts of nucleoplasm after treatment with the drug .

effect of flavopiridol on embryo transcription
to directly measure of pol ii-dependent transcription in fertilized embryos in the presence of flavopiridol, nascent rna chains were labeled in situ by incorporation of bromouridine 5'-triphosphate . one-cell embryos were cultured in the presence of either  <dig> μg/ml α-amanitin or  <dig> nm flavopiridol. this concentration of α-amanitin has been shown to prevent all rna polymerase-dependent transcription in eukaryotic cells. nuclear labeling was obvious in both male and female pronuclei of untreated embryos . confocal microscopy showed that fluorescence intensity clearly differed among control, α-amanitin-, and flavopiridol-treated embryos. strong nuclear labeling was observed in control 2-cell embryos, whereas no nuclear signal was detected in 2-cell embryos treated with  <dig> μg/ml α-amanitin . in flavopiridol-treated embryos, however, the fluorescence signal was dramatically decreased compared with that of untreated embryos; only a very faint nuclear signal was detectable . this is explained by the fact that pol i and pol iii transcriptional activities may not be affected by the inhibition of cdk <dig> 

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that cdk <dig> and its regulatory partner, cyclin t <dig>  are present in mouse oocytes as well as during all preimplantation stages of development . in immunofluorescence experiments, signals from both proteins decreased only during blastocyst expansion. in view of the finding that both proteins are present as early as the gv oocyte stage including nsn and sn oocytes, it appears that the relevant products are translated from maternal messages at this stage. cdk <dig> was predominantly nuclear, whereas cyclin t <dig> showed a nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution in immature oocytes. this observation is consistent with the finding that gv oocytes are transcriptionally active  <cit> . during oogenesis, an important transition takes place at the level of gene expression, as transcriptionally active  chromatin becomes silenced  during meiosis. accordingly, chromatin is modified and transcription factors are generally excluded from compact chromosomes. some lines of evidence indicate that cdk <dig> is recruited to mitotic chromosomes at telophase in somatic cells  <cit> , but our observations showed that cdk <dig> is not recruired to either meiotic or preimplantation mitotic chromosomes.

after fertilization, cyclin t <dig> was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and cdk <dig> was predominantly localized in the nucleus. at the mid one-cell stage, nucleoplasmic signals from cdk <dig> increased and concurrently, cyclin t <dig> accumulated within pronuclei. a priviuous study showed that pol ii subunits as well as other components of the basal transcription machinery are maternally contributed to the cytoplasm of the early embryo and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nuclei immediately prior to embryonic genome activation  <cit> . as the p-tefb complex is a ctd kinase, nuclear accumulation of cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> at the late one-cell stage is consistent with nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated ctd during this period , concomitant with transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome  <cit> . thus, the change in cdk <dig> localization from the cytoplasm to pronuclei may be closely related to the minor phase of embryonic genome activation. in most instances, signals from both proteins were more intense within male pronuclei, in accordance with earlier activation of transcription in this pronucleus  <cit> . although it is unclear whether the regulated translocation of the basal transcriptional machinery causes a transcriptional onset, or whether basal transcriptional components accumulate in early embryonic nuclei because of transcriptional activation, we hypothesize that nuclear translocation of factors such as cdk <dig>  necessary for the transition from the initiation to elongation phase of transcription, regulates the onset of productive transcription in the embryo. in our experiments, the strongest signal from cdk <dig> was observed at the two-cell stage, during which cyclin t <dig> was predominantly localized in nuclei . this is the time of major embryonic genome activation in the mouse. thus, extensive nuclear accumulation of cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig> at the two-cell stage appears to be significantly associated with the major step of embryonic genome activation.

our in situ run-on transcription assay coupled with fluorescence microscopy showed that, compared with untreated embryos, brutp incorporation into nascent rnas was reduced in flavopiridol-treated embryos, suggesting that transcription was defective in such embryos . in the presence of a high concentration of α-amanitin , sufficient to block the actions of all rna polymerases, no brutp incorporation was evident. however, in the presence of flavopiridol, a faint nuclear signal was seen, likely due to pol i- and pol iii-dependent transcription that was not inhibited by flavopiridol. in addition, treatment of embryos with flavopiridol resulted in aberrant localization of cdk <dig>  cyclin t <dig>  and phosphorylated pol ii ctd . our experiments showed that treatment with flavopiridol changed evenly distributed ser2p and ser5p ctd to uneven dot-like structures  in 2-cell embryo nuclei . this is a common feature of pol ii and some other components of transcription machinery to form large and round speckles after inhibition of transcription  <cit> . this can be seen in our experiments. however, treatment with flavopiridol did not change unphosphorylated pol ii ctd  to dot-like structures in 2-cell embryos. rather, it seems that unp ctd is accumulated in some parts of nucleoplasm. this accumulation may be due to lack of ser <dig> and/or ser <dig> phosphorylation of the ctd in treated embryos. by increasing concentration of inhibitors like α-amanitin or drb, the number of these speckles decreases and their sizes increase. and as seen in figure 3a, cdk <dig> does not form speckles in treated embryos. that is obvious since in these embryos cdk <dig> fails to enter the nucleus. complete absence of nuclear cdk <dig> in treated 2-cell embryos may be due to long exposure of them to cdk <dig> inhibitor. these data clearly imply that nuclear translocation of cdk <dig>  followed by functional activity thereof, are essential for genomic activation in the mouse embryo. previous studies have shown that cyclin t <dig> is predominantly a nuclear protein distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, and that protein signal intensity is elevated at discrete foci   <cit> . cdk <dig> is present principally in the nucleus, but can additionally be visualized in the cytoplasm, and thus shuttles between the two cellular compartments  <cit> . a recent study found that nuclear localization of cdk <dig> requires that the kinase be catalytically active; the cited work showed that catalytically inactive kinase mutants failed to accumulate in the nucleus, rather remaining diffusely distributed in a subcellular localization  <cit> .

it has been reported that the cdk <dig> c-terminal tail region contains ser and thr residues serving as the major phospho-acceptor sites for autophosphorylation. mutation of these residues affects autophosphorylation but is not essential for binding of cdk <dig> to cyclin t <dig> or for phosphorylation of heterologous substrates  <cit> . flavopiridol effectively blocks p-tefb kinase activity  <cit> , possibly explaining the aberrant localization of cdk9/cyclin t <dig> in the flavopiridol-treated two-cell embryos of our experiments. although previous work showed that the long-term exposure of mammalian cells to high concentrations of flavopiridol resulted in g1-s arrest associated with loss of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> , a very recent study revealed that cdk <dig> is the only essential cell cycle cdk  <cit> . in effect, mouse embryos lacking all interphase cdks  undergo organogenesis and develop to mid-gestation  <cit> . only cdk <dig> inactivation results in failure to develop to the morula and blastocyst stages. in addition, our observations indicated that exposure of one-cell stage embryos to flavopiridol caused two-cell developmental block, but exposure of embryos to drug after embryonic genome activation did not result in cell cycle arrest . together, the data suggest that the developmental arrest observed at the two-cell stage is caused by inactivation of cdk <dig> and may not attributable to the cytotoxicity of flavopiridol or to a drug effect on cdks involved in regulation of the cell cycle. our results thus indicate that cdk <dig> could play an important role in embryonic genome activation in the mouse.

CONCLUSIONS
cdk <dig> and cyclin t <dig>  subunits of the positive transcription elongation factor p-tefb, are present and functional in mouse oocytes and early embryos. inhibition of the kinase activity of p-tefb using a cdk9-specific inhibitor, flavopiridol, caused defects in transcription, abnormal cellular p-tefb localization, and developmental arrest at the time of genome activation in mouse two-cell stage embryos. our results reveal that cdk <dig> function is essential for embryonic genome activation in the mouse.
