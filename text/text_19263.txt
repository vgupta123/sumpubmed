BACKGROUND
antimony  is a metal belonging to group v in the periodic table. it is present in aquatic systems and soil, with stibnite  representing the most common mineral form  <cit> . antimonials have been used to treat leishmaniasis for over 60 years  <cit> . however, the u.s. environmental protection agency recognized sb as a priority pollutant  <cit> , and the who has proposed 5 μg/l to be the highest acceptable sb concentration in potable water  <cit> . although sb pollution has gained increased attention in recent decades , the exact mechanism of sb toxicity in both mammals and microorganism remains unclear  <cit> .

a comparison of two common inorganic forms of sb revealed that antimonite  was more toxic than antimonate   <cit> . the abiotic sb oxidation in the natural environment is extremely slow  <cit> . in contrast, sb-oxidizing bacteria can oxidize sb at a relatively high rate. thus, sb oxidation was proposed to be a microbial detoxification process that could be useful for environmental sb bioremediation . a few sb-oxidizing bacteria had been reported in earlier literature  <cit> . recently, dozens of sb-oxidizing bacteria have been isolated and identified both by our group and by others  <cit> . the arsenite oxidase aioab in agrobacterium tumefaciens was also found to be able to oxidize sb  <cit> . in addition, the oxidoreductase anoa was shown to be responsible for bacterial sb oxidation  <cit> . however, the disruption of both of these genes did not result in a complete loss of sb oxidation, indicating the existence of other mechanisms responsible for bacterial sb oxidation.

in general, aerobic respiration is inevitably accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species . ros include superoxide , hydroxyl , hydroperoxyl , and peroxyl  radicals and other oxidizing agents, such as hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . among the various ros, o2
•- is the primary radical that results from the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen  via the bacterial respiratory chain. subsequently, o2
•- can be converted into h2o <dig> and o <dig> by superoxide dismutase . both o2
•- and h2o <dig> can generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals via the haber-weiss reaction or the fenton reaction  <cit> . ros can damage different types of macromolecules; thus, bacteria have evolved defense mechanisms against ros and induce specific genes in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . glutathione  is the central substrate involved in cellular protection against ros and their toxic products in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in bacteria gsh plays multiple role in protection against environmental stresses such as osmotic shock and acidity, as well as against toxins and oxidative stress. indeed, gsh represents the primary low molecular weight thiol in many gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . two enzymes  catalyze the de novo synthesis of gsh. these two enzymes are encoded by distinct genes  in most bacteria  <cit> .

previously, the aerobic, arsenite-oxidizing bacterium pseudomonas stutzeri ts <dig> was isolated from arsenic-contaminated soil  <cit>  and the genome sequence was published . in this study, we showed that strain ts <dig> is able to oxidize sb to sb. therefore, in an effort to determine the molecular mechanism underlying bacterial sb oxidation, more than  <dig> tn <dig> transposon insertion mutants were generated and screened. we isolated a mutant of gsha  that showed an increase in sb oxidation rate. the sb oxidation rates of the wild type, mutant and complemented strain, the gene transcription of gsha, sod and kate, as well as the cellular contents of ros, gsh and h2o <dig> were analyzed since gsha is responsible for the biosynthesis of gsh and therefore involved in the cellular stress defense system.

isolation of a sb sensitive transposon mutant and complementation of the mutant strain
plasmid prl27-kan was transferred into p. stutzeri ts <dig> by conjugation from e. coli strain s17- <dig> carrying tn <dig> as described previously  <cit> . to obtain sb sensitive mutants, the colonies of transformants from the mating plates were spread onto lb agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kan and 50 μg/ml rif, in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mmol/l c8h4k2o12sb2s <dig> . the mutants did not grow in the presence of the indicated concentration of sb. the insertion sequence of the mutant was determined using a plasmid rescue strategy as described by zheng et al.  <cit> . the sequences were compared to the draft genome sequence of p. stutzeri ts <dig> using blast  <cit>  and compared to the protein sequence database at genbank using the blastx algorithm  <cit> . finally, the sb-sensitive tn5-insertion mutant ts44-gsha <dig> was isolated.

the construction of the gsha complementary strain ts44-gsha-c was accomplished using the high-copy broad host range plasmid pct-zori containing a kan resistance determinant . briefly, a 2023 bp dna fragment containing the complete gsha coding region along with 156 bp upstream and 289 bp downstream sequence was pcr-amplified using the gsha-f/gsha-r primers  and subsequently cloned into hindiii + bamhi-digested pct-zori. the resulting plasmid pct-zori-gsha was transformed into e. coli s17- <dig> and conjugated into the mutant ts44-gsha <dig>  yielding the complementary strain ts44-gsha-c. the integrity of the mutant and the complementary strain was confirmed by pcr amplification and subsequent dna sequencing.

growth and sb oxidation tests
overnight cultures of p. stutzeri strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c  were inoculated into 100 ml of cdm medium with or without  <dig>  mmol/l sb and incubated at 28 °c for 48 h with shaking at 170 rpm. culture samples were collected to determine the od <dig> value using a uv spectrophotometer  at the designated time points. sb/sb concentrations were monitored using hydride-generation atomic fluorescence spectroscopy combining hplc  according to the method described by li et al.  <cit> . the measured data were analyzed with single factor analysis of variance  method in excel program.

gsha activity and determination of gsh content
to detect gsha activity and gsh content, p. stutzeri strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c were cultured under aerobic condition with shaking in 100 ml of liquid cdm medium at 28 °c. sb was added at a final concentration of  <dig>  mmol/l when the od <dig> reached  <dig> . cultures without the addition of sb were used as controls. one mililiter of cells was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4 °c after 30 min of cultivation. the pellet was washed twice using phosphate-buffered saline , then resuspended in 1 ml of pbs and sonicated on ice to dissolve the cell membranes. the total protein content of the sonicate was measured by the coomassie brilliant blue g-250-staining method  <cit> . bovine serum albumin was used as the standard.

the gsha activity and gsh content were determined using  <dig>  3-naphthalenedicarboxyaldehyde   as described previously  <cit> . to measure gsha activity, an equal volume of cell lysate was mixed with the gsha reaction buffer and substrate solution . fifty microliter of reaction terminator  was added after 45 min of incubation at 28 °c. the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min. then, 20 μl of the supernatants were transferred to wells of black microlon 96-well plates . the samples were mixed with 180 μl of nda derivatization solution . fluorescence was measured  with an envision® multimode plate reader  after 60 min of incubation at 37 °c and converted to the γ-glutamylcysteine concentration using appropriate calibration standards. the procedure for measuring gsh content was almost the same as the procedure to detect gsha activity, except that the reaction terminator was added immediately when the equal volume of cell lysate was mixed with the gsha reaction buffer and substrate solution .

determination of the ros content
the cellular ros content was tested with the fluorescent probe  <dig>  7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate  . the cells were cultivated and collected for processing as described above. cells from  <dig>  ml cultures were washed two times with pbs buffer and resuspended in  <dig>  ml of pbs buffer. then, a  <dig>  ml cell suspension was mixed with 5 μl of  <dig>  mmol/l dcfh-da and incubated at 37 °c for 30 min to develop the fluorescent product dcf. the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 3 min at  <dig>  × g and washed two times using pbs buffer  to remove background fluorescence. the fluorescence was measured  on the envision® multimode plate reader   <cit> . the ros contents were normalized to the total protein content as described above.

quantification of gene expression using a lacz reporter gene fusion and qrt-pcr
quantitative reverse transcription pcr  was employed to test the transcription of gsha, two superoxide dismutase -encoding genes  and the catalase kate. the strains were inoculated into 100 ml of cdm medium.  <dig>  mmol/l of sb was added  when the od <dig> reached  <dig> . the cells were harvested after 30 min. total rna was extracted using the trizol® reagent  and treated with dnasei following the manufacturer’s instructions. the synthesis of cdna from 300 ng of total rna was performed using the revertaid first strand cdna synthesis kit   <cit> . the resulting cdna was used as a template for qrt-pcr with the sybr-green® qpcr master mix . primers rt-gsha-f/rt-gsha-r, rt-sodb-f/rt-sodb-r, rt-sodc-f/rt-sodc-r and rt-kate-f/rt-kate-r were used to test the expression of gsha, sodb, sodc and kate, respectively. the rt-pcrs were performed using the ab viia  <dig> rt-pcr system  following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. the annealing temperature for gsha and sodb was 55 °c, while for sodc and kate it was 48 °c.

for the lacz reporter fusion analysis, plasmid plsp-kt2lacz was used to construct the lacz fusions. dna fragments containing the predicted promoter regions of gsha, sodb and sodc were amplified by pcr using the primers pgsha-f/pgsha-r, psodb-f/psodb-r and psodc-f/psodc-r, respectively. the dna fragments were digested using ecori and bamhi and ligated into the double-digested plsp-kt2lacz. the resulting plasmids plsp-pgsha, plsp-psodb, and plsp-psodc were separately transferred into strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha <dig> by conjugation employing e. coli s17- <dig>  the resulting strains containing the above constructs were inoculated into 100 ml of cdm medium and cultivated with shaking at 28 °c.  <dig>  mmol/l of sb was added when the od <dig> reached  <dig> . the samples were collected and the β-galactosidase activity was tested according to the method described by miller  <cit>  after 30 min of incubation.

determination of the linear correlation between h2o <dig> and sb oxidation rate
to test the h2o <dig> content, strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c were incubated as described above. to eliminate the h2o <dig> content difference caused by the different amount of cell collection, sb was added when the od <dig> reached  <dig> , and then 2 ml of cells were harvested after a 30 min incubation with sb. the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of k3po <dig>  after washing twice with 50 mmol/l k3po <dig>  and sonicated on ice. then, the sonicated cell lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g at 4 °c, and  <dig>  ml of the supernatant was transferred to wells of black microlon 96-well plates . the samples were mixed with 50 μl of amplex red   and 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase  , then incubated at 37 °c for 15 min. fluorescence was measured  as described above using the envision® multimode plate reader  and converted to the h2o <dig> concentration using appropriate calibration standards  <cit> .

to detect the dynamic variation of the h2o <dig> and sb contents, strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c were inoculated into 100 ml of cdm medium supplemented with  <dig>  mmol/l sb. the cells were harvested and sonicated as described above at the designated time points. the sb contents were monitored using hplc-hg-afs as described above, while the h2o <dig> contents were determined by the ar/hrp method as described above. a boiled cdm culture of strain ts44-gsha <dig> was used as a control. to test the effect of h2o <dig> on bacterial growth, strain ts <dig> was inoculated onto cdm plates containing different concentrations of h2o <dig> and cultivated at 28 °c for 48 h.

in vitro oxidation of sb by h2o <dig> was performed using an un-inoculated liquid cdm medium containing  <dig>  mmol/l of sb and the media with the addition of  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mmol/l of h2o <dig> and reacted within 10 min.

RESULTS
a sb-sensitive mutant could be generated by transposon mutagenesis
more than  <dig> transposon insertions were isolated and screened for loss of sb resistance with one mutant displaying lower sb resistance. this strain, ts44-gsha <dig>  was selected for further characterization . the tn <dig> transposon had inserted into gsha encoding a putative glutamate-cysteine ligase at nucleotide  <dig> . the gsha encoded glutamate-cysteine ligase is the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo gsh biosynthesis and therefore is involved in conferring resistance to ros and their toxic products  <cit> . additionally, a strain complementing the gsha insertion was constructed and named ts44-gsha-c. diagnostic pcrs were used to confirm the transposon mutation and the complementation .

an insertion in gsha led to an increased sb oxidation rate
cells of p. stutzeri ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c were incubated in cdm medium lacking sb supplementation after thorough washing. the growth of strain ts44-gsha <dig> was slightly slower compared to the wild type strain . the growth of strain ts44-gsha <dig> was further delayed by supplementation with  <dig>  mmol/l sb, causing strain ts44-gsha <dig> to need an extra 24 h to reach the lag phase . the gsha complementing strain ts44-gsha-c showed no difference in growth compared to the wild type strain regardless of whether sb was added or not. although the growth of ts44-gsha <dig> was delayed, strain ts44-gsha <dig> oxidized 88% sb to sb in 48 h . in contrast, strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c both oxidized only 48% sb to sb in 48 h . the sb-oxidation rate of ts44-gsha <dig> significantly increased by 83% in the monitored 48 h time frame  .fig.  <dig> growth curves of p. stutzeri strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c without  or with  the addition of  <dig>  mmol/l sb. error bars correspond to the standard deviations of the means from three independent experiments

an insertion in gsha eliminated gsha activity and influenced cellular contents of gsh and ros
we investigated both gsha activity and the gsh and ros content to elucidate how the presence of gsha affected sb oxidation. the gsha activity in strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c was slightly increased following the addition of sb; however, gsha activity was undetectable in the insertional mutant strain ts44-gsha <dig> , indicating that the transposon insertion functionally disrupted gsha in strain ts <dig>  consistent with this result, the gsh content was decreased by approximately 66% in the mutant compared to strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c regardless of whether sb was provided .fig.  <dig> 
gsha insertion affected gsh content, gsha activity and ros content. a, gsha activity, , gsh content, , ros content and  ros content in strain ts44-gsha <dig>  data symbols shown in panels ,  and  are the same. data are expressed as the mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  **indicates a significant difference from the control 




as a next step, cellular ros content was determined because gsh is the central substrate for cellular protection against ros and their toxic products  <cit> . the cellular ros content in strain ts44-gsha <dig> was increased by approximately three-fold compared to strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c regardless of whether sb was provided or not. the cellular ros content was significantly decreased in strain ts44-gsha <dig> after 30 min of incubation with sb compared to no sb addition , despite the fact that gsha was mutated and the gsh content was obviously decreased . after addition of sb, the ros content changed quickly in 30 min, and decreased significantly in the strain ts44-gsha <dig> . in such a short time, the oxidation rate of sb did not significantly change. the sb oxidation mainly occurred in the 36–48 h time frame .

sb affected transcription of gsha, sodb, sodc and kate differently
the expression of gsha, sodb, sodc and kate was monitored, because gsha, sodb, sodc and kate are all involved in changes of gsh, ros or h2o <dig>  there are two distinct genes  encoding superoxide dismutase  on the genome of p. stutzeri ts <dig> that encode for fe sod and cu-zn sod, respectively. these two enzymes shared over 83% and 58% amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes of other species of pseudomonas, respectively, and can convert o2
•- to h2o <dig> and o <dig>  in the lacz reporter fusion analysis, we only transformed the lacz fusions designated plsp-pgsha, plsp-psodb and plsp-psodc into strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha <dig> because the gsha complementary strain ts44-gsha-c carried a plasmid that might be incompatible with the lacz fusion.

the transcription levels of gsha, sodb, sodc and kate were tested by qrt-pcr in all three strains. sb had no effect on the transcription of gsha in strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> or ts44-gsha-c . the gsha::lacz fusion only showed a low level of background expression levels in the gsha insertional mutation strain ts44-gsha <dig>  , which indicated a very low promoter activity of gsha, while qrt-pcr analysis showed no transcription of gsha in strain ts44-gsha <dig> . moreover, lacz fusion and qrt-pcr both showed that the sodb gene was strongly induced by sb in all three strains . sb only induced transcription of sodc and kate in the mutant strain ts44-gsha <dig>  but not in strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c .fig.  <dig> the effect of sb to the transcription of gsha, sodb, sodc and kate. the transcription of gsha, sodb and sodc was tested by a lacz reporter fusion and qrt-pcr, while the kate transcription was only tested by qrt-pcr. for lacz reporter fusion , data are expressed as the mean ± sd, n =  <dig>  **indicates a significant difference from the control . for qrt-pcr, error bars correspond to the standard deviations of the means from three biological replicates. gene expression was normalized to the 16s rrna gene. the results are presented as the mean gene expression normalized to mrna levels in sb-free cdm. data symbols shown in all panels are the same

disruption of gsh synthesis allowed accumulation of h2o2
in order to examine whether the ros-protection system is involved in h2o <dig> production, we tested the h2o <dig> content in the presence and absence of sb in all strains. the h2o <dig> content was slightly higher in gsha mutant strain ts44-gsha <dig> without addition of sb compared to strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c . notably, after a 30 min incubation with  <dig>  mmol/l sb, the h2o <dig> content was increased in the mutant strain ts44-gsha <dig>  but slightly decreased in strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c , indicating that the disruption of gsh synthesis is related to the accumulation of h2o <dig>  in addition, it appears the conversion of ros by sod was more efficient than the h2o <dig> conversion by kate and thus would both sod and kate were induced by sb.

h2o <dig> is responsible for sb oxidation
h2o <dig> was shown to be an efficient sb oxidant in vitro  as the un-inoculated control showed no sb oxidation . a control with dead cells after boiling the culture also showed no oxidation of sb . as the efficiency of sb oxidation in the mutant strain ts44-gsha <dig> was shown to be highest from  <dig> to 48 h , the h2o <dig> and sb content in strains ts <dig>  ts44-gsha <dig> and ts44-gsha-c were also measured from  <dig> to 48 h. interestingly, the h2o <dig> content in strain ts44-gsha <dig> was significantly decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nmol/mg protein, while the h2o <dig> content was stable at a low level in strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c . correspondingly, sb was oxidized to sb concomitant with a decrease in h2o <dig> content, while the sb concentration was almost stable in strains ts <dig> and ts44-gsha-c . the consumed h2o <dig> content and the oxidized sb showed a linear correlation with a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  , indicating that h2o <dig> is responsible for sb oxidation. in addition, we could show that growth was inhibited with increasing concentration of h2o <dig> , thus sb oxidation may contribute to the bacterial detoxification of h2o <dig> and sb.

discussion
at present, several sb-oxidizing strains have been reported  <cit> ; some of these strains were also able to oxidize as  <cit> . the arsenite oxidase aioab was demonstrated to be capable of oxidizing sb, but the aioab kinetic rate of the reaction was orders of magnitude higher for as than for sb  <cit> . moreover, anoa belonging to the sdr superfamily was reported to be able to catalyze sb oxidation using nadp+ as a cofactor  <cit> . however, disruption of aioa and anoa in agrobacterium tumefaciens caused a decrease in sb oxidation of only about 25%  <cit>  and 27%  <cit> , respectively, indicating the existence of other bacterial sb oxidation mechanisms. after discovering that the presence of gsha affected the sb oxidation rate by transposon mutagenesis in strain ts44-gsha <dig>  we proposed that some abiotic cellular components, such as gsh, ros or h2o <dig>  may have a role in the bacterial oxidation of sb.

subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive analysis. first, we found that a disruption of gsha caused a decrease in the cellular gsh amount; second, it is conceivable that the gsha mutant strain resulted in an increase in cellular ros content compared to the wild type; third, we could also show a linear correlation between the decrease of h2o <dig> content and the increase in sb oxidation rate, indicating that sb oxidation consumed h2o <dig> and acts as a detoxification mechanism to counter this cellular stressor. in addition, it appeared that sb directly caused a disruption of the ros-protection system in strain ts44-gsha <dig> and allowed the accumulation of h2o <dig> instead of affecting gsh levels, since neither the activity of gsha nor the gsh content were influenced by sb. previously, it was reported that sb may consume residual gsh  <dig> complex) in red blood cells  <cit> . however, we did not observe significant changes in gsh content when sb was added to wild type strain ts <dig> and the gsha complemented strain ts44-gsha-c, indicating little of this complex was formed and sb was mainly oxidized to sb by h2o <dig>  we therefore propose a new model for sb oxidation in p. stutzeri ts <dig>  i) the addition of sb would trigger the ros-protective system by inducing the transcription of sodb, sodc and kate, with sodb and sodc catalyzing the conversion of ros to h2o <dig>  and kate responsible for the depletion of excessive h2o2; ii) the increased cellular h2o <dig> content enhanced the sb oxidation rate; and iii) the addition of sb played a selection role on the characterization of the gsha insertion ; iv) in addition, the accumulated h2o <dig> was partially consumed by kate , since kate was induced by sb , and similar result was described recently with transcription of the peroxidase-encoding gene kata being induced by both sb and h2o <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the proposed model for sb bacterial oxidation in p. steutzeri ts <dig>  in this study, i) the addition of sb would trigger the ros-protective system by inducing the transcription of sodb, sodc and kate, with sodb and sodc catalyzing the conversion of ros to h2o <dig>  while kate responsible for the degradation of excessive h2o <dig> ; ii) the increased cellular h2o <dig> content enhanced the sb oxidation rate; and iii) the addition of sb played a selection role on the characterization of gsha insertion; iv) in addition, the accumulated h2o <dig> is partially cosumed by the upregulated catalase kate 




several chemical substances  have been reported to be capable of mediating sb oxidation in vitro . oh• was the oxidant in acidic solutions and h2o <dig> was the main oxidant in neutral and alkaline solutions involved in sb oxidation, with a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . sb was reported to cause cellular oxidative stress in lymphoid tumoral cells  <cit> . h2o <dig> is a substantial component of cellular oxidative stress  <cit>  and can inhibit cellular growth  <cit> . in this study, the ph of the cultures changed from the initial  <dig>  to approximately  <dig>  following exposure to sb, indicating that h2o <dig> may correlate with an increase in the sb oxidation rate. in addition, the in vitro experiment provided direct evidence that h2o <dig> can oxidize sb to sb  and a correlation between the concentrations of sb and h2o <dig> was found in vivo . as an moderatedly reactive intermediate, o2
•- may also have an effect on sb oxidation. however, in the presence of high level of sod, the steady-state of o2
•- would be no more than  <dig>  nmol/l and thus the effect of o2
•- is negligible  <cit> . thus, we conclude that h2o <dig> oxidized sb to sb.

CONCLUSIONS
this study proposed a novel mechanism for microbial antimonite oxidation involving changes in cellular content of components related to oxidative stress . although h2o <dig> was reported to be capable of oxidizing sb chemically as early as  <dig>  <cit> , this is the first study to demonstrate that h2o <dig> is responsible for sb-oxidation in a microbe. the results showed that a disruption of bacterial gsh-dependent ros-protection mechanism allowed h2o <dig> to build up and thus promote the oxidation of sb to sb. in addition, the oxidation of sb to sb is a detoxification process against the cellular stressor h2o <dig>  we do not exclude the possibility of an additional enzymatic process responsible for sb oxidation in strain ts <dig>  since genes encoding a putative arsenite oxidase aioba were found on its genome  <cit>  which may function as a sb oxidase. our data and other findings  <cit>  could show that microbial antimonite oxidation contains both biotic and abiotic components.
