BACKGROUND
micrornas  are regulators that modulate transcription and translation of target mrnas. there are over  <dig>  mirnas encoded within the human genome and these mirnas are estimated to target ~60% of genes. the discovery of mirnas has introduced a new level of complexity to be considered for every biological process. mirnas are implicated in normal biological functioning, including development, differentiation, homeostasis and apoptotic cell death  <cit> . their dysregulation leads to disease processes including malignancy  <cit> , inflammation  <cit>  and heart disease  <cit> .

mirnas are mediators of inflammation  <cit> , an important mechanism driving chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  development and progression. several mirnas have been implicated in lung disease  <cit> . exposure to cigarette smoke extract , diesel exhaust particles  and lipopolysaccharide  induce changes in lung expression of several mirnas including mir-26b, mir- <dig>  let-7a and mir- <dig> <cit> . mirnas associated with asthma include mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-148a/b and mir- <dig> <cit> . other mirnas are associated with the inflammation observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis   <cit>  and cystic fibrosis  <cit> , and many studies implicate mirnas in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. collectively these studies demonstrate that mirnas are expressed in the lung and are involved in the pathogenesis of lung disease.

copd prevalence is continually increasing and it is predicted to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by  <dig>  <cit> . copd is under-diagnosed, since patients are most often diagnosed only when the disease is advanced, too late for prevention, and when there is no curative intervention. better screening to detect early disease and targeted therapies to prevent progression to severe copd are urgently needed to improve copd outcomes. genomic tools provide an opportunity to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of copd and translate this to enhanced clinical management  <cit> . current understanding of copd pathogenesis is that lung injury by inhaled tobacco results in depletion of lung alveolar tissue, large and small airway inflammation, fibrosis of small airways and mucus hypersecretion contributing to small airway obstruction. inflammation is the main cause of lung tissue destruction and provokes defense mechanisms associated with tissue repair  <cit> .

given the role of mirnas in lung inflammation and the lung’s response to inhaled toxins, mirnas are likely to be involved in pathogenesis and/or progression of copd. furthermore, mirnas regulate mrna expression, and mrna  profiles relevant to copd pathogenesis have been identified  <cit> . mirna profiles in lung from patients with copd have shown differences in mirna expression in relation to susceptibility to copd  <cit> , when comparing moderate/severe copd patients with non-copd subjects  <cit> . here we aimed to identify lung mirnas associated with copd severity, and demonstrate mirna regulation of genes that may be implicated in the progression of copd.

methods
participant selection
this study was approved by the human research ethics committees of the university of queensland and the prince charles hospital . lung tissue samples from  <dig> patients with copd undergoing curative resection for lung cancer were selected from the tpch tissue bank. written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to surgery. detailed information on subject selection, and inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, smokers with at least a  <dig> pack year history who quit smoking at least  <dig> months prior to surgery, not currently on inhaled or oral steroids, and without other lung pathology that may confound spirometry measurements, were considered. all had fev1/fvc  ratio < <dig> , indicating the presence of copd. twenty-nine former smokers with copd  were selected and classified by gas transfer measurements  as “mild” emphysema  and “moderate” emphysema .

mirna isolation, hybridization and data extraction
total rna was isolated from 30-45 mg of non-tumour lung tissue using trizol . dna was removed using an ambion dna-free™ kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. the resulting total rna was cleaned using the dneasy mirna clean up kit  following manufacturer’s instructions. purified rna was quality checked using a bioanalyzer agilent technologies, santa clara, ca, usa), based on the presence of mirnas determined using a small rna analysis kit and distinct 18s and 28s peaks determined by an mrna analysis kit. agilent human mirna oligo arrays  based on mirbase v <dig>  were used. this array contains  <dig>  elements representing  <dig> human mirs and  <dig> viral mirs. the experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, 100 ng of total rna from lung tissue was dephosphorylated using calf intestine alkaline phosphotase to create sticky ends for ligation of the fluorescent dye pcp-cy <dig> and t <dig> rna ligase . the resulting labeled rna was purified using micro-bio spin  <dig> columns  to remove unlabeled dye and then hybridized to the agilent microarray slide for  <dig> hours at 55°c. the slides were washed to remove any unbound rna and images were captured using agilent microarray scanner. raw features were filtered for spot quality, averaged and extracted using agilent feature extraction software. the missing values were filled in using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in avadis . study design for microarray experiments satisfied the miame guidelines . the referred data has been deposited in the gene expression omnibus  .

candidate mirna selection and technical validation using qrt-pcr
mirnas differentially expressed between mild and moderate classes of emphysema lungs were identified by class comparison analysis in brb-arraytools v <dig>  . a p value of < <dig>  and false discovery rate  of < <dig>  were used as selection criteria for significance. two mirnas were randomly chosen for technical validation by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  using taqman microrna assays . the geometric mean  of two small rna housekeepers, u <dig> and rnu <dig>  were used for normalization  <cit> .

identifying genes modulated by mir-34c using in vitro techniques
mrnas targets of altered mirna expression in commonly used lung cell lines were identified using in vitro techniques.

cell lines
commercial lung cell lines beas-2b  <cit>   and hfl <dig>  <cit>   were purchased from atcc . the cell lines were grown as per the supplier’s recommendations. beas-2b and hfl <dig> were cultured in rpmi and dmem, respectively, supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fcs and incubated in 5% co <dig> 

transfection conditions
a microrna  that technically validated and displayed high fold change difference between emphysema classes was chosen for this purpose. pre-mir™ mirna precursor molecules  for mir-34c-5p were used to increase the expression of the mir-34c in hfl <dig> and beas-2b lung cells and the expected increase in expression of mir-34c was confirmed using taqman micrornas assays . the -5p isoform of mir-34c-5p represents the 5′ arm of the hairpin precursor of the mature mirna from which the mature sequence has been excised. the probe sequence represented on the microarray was derived from the mir-34c-5p sequence. optimal conditions were tested and selected based on the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly  <dig>  cells were transiently transfected with 20nm pre-mir precursor molecules and neofx transfection reagent for  <dig> hours. the transfection was conducted twice in triplicate each time on two different days two weeks apart. the triplicates were combined for the arrays to provide enough total rna for the assay.

mrna isolation, hybridization and data extraction
total rna was extracted and purified from cell lines, beas-2b and hfl <dig>  after transfection, using rneasy mini kit and rnase free dnase kit . microarray expression profiling was conducted on the purified rna using illumina ht12v <dig> whole genome gene expression arrays, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the array contains  <dig>  elements representing over  <dig>  annotated genes from the refseq  and unigene databases . element features were extracted using the gene expression module of the beadstudio v <dig> . <dig> software . raw features were normalized to the 75th percentile of all elements in genespring gx v <dig> . missing values were filled in using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in avadis . differentially expressed genes were identified using class comparison analysis in brb-arraytoolv <dig> .

identification of mir-34c predicted targets
the genes differentially expressed between mir-34c transfected and non-transfected cells were compared to the predicted targets of mir-34c from the targetscan and pictar databases. candidate target genes whose expression were negatively correlated to that of mir-34c in vitro  and ex vivo  were identified. therefore, identified genes were biologically validated in the original tpch-kco  <cit>  samples  by qrt-pcr using pre-designed gene expression assays . the raw expression was normalised to the house-keeping gene, gapdh.

RESULTS
identification of mirnas associated with emphysema severity using microarrays and confirmation by qrt-pcr
agilent human mirna oligo  <dig> × 15 k array experiments were conducted on samples of lung from patients with mild  or moderate emphysema . demographic data are shown in table  <dig>  after preprocessing of the raw signals,  <dig> mirnas were detected in at least 50% of the lung samples. duplicate array data for these  <dig> mirnas were highly correlated . class comparison identified five mirnas  that were significantly differentially expressed between mild and moderate emphysema . all five were expressed at lower levels in lung from patients with moderate emphysema, compared with lung from patients with mild emphysema. in this cohort, expression of three of these mirnas  correlated with functional measurement of emphysema severity . mir-34c expression exhibited the greatest difference between groups with  <dig>  fold lower expression in the moderate severity group. qrt-pcr confirmed similar fold differences in expression to microarray results for the two mirnas, mir-34c and mir-133a tested . a flow diagram describing the methods is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>

effect of mir-34c-5p over-expression on its predicted mrna targets in respiratory cells in vitro using gene expression microarrays
to identify mrna targets regulated by mir-34c in lung cells, we transfected mir-34c-5p precursor into beas-2b and hfl <dig> cells, and demonstrated the expected 95-99% increased expression of mir-34c by qrt-pcr . illumina humanht <dig> v <dig> transcriptome microarrays were then used to examine the expression of mrnas in mir-34c-transfected cells, relative to cells transfected with scrambled sequence controls. class comparison analysis in brb-arraytools v <dig>  identified  <dig>  elements  affected by over-expression of mir-34c  in beas-2b and hfl <dig> cell lines, the vast majority of which  were down-regulated by elevated mir-34c levels. among the  <dig>  genes, fifty were predicted as mir-34c targets by the databases pictar and targetscan-and they were significantly down-regulated  in the transfectants. we next examined ex vivo expression patterns of the genes found to be mir-34c responsive in vitro. of the fifty genes, thirty-three were represented in the filtered tpch-kco dataset  <cit>  and thirty-two in the dataset of spira et al. <cit> .

in both of these datasets, five genes  were expressed at higher levels in lung from patients with moderate or severe emphysema compared with lung from normal subjects or subjects with mild emphysema, whereas expression of mir-34c was reciprocal , consistent with the possibility that these five genes may be regulated by mir-34c in emphysema. in the  <dig> ex vivo lung samples used for mirna microarray profiling, qrt-pcr confirmed that expression of both serpine <dig>  and hnf4a  had generally higher expression in association with lower mir-34c expression; however only serpine <dig>  was significantly differentially expressed between mild and moderate emphysema  in this cohort, and it was correspondingly upregulated in more severe disease in both tpch-kco  and spira  datasets .

discussion
mirnas regulate the expression of genes involved in biological processes relevant to the progression of chronic lung disease, including cellular stress, cell differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . here, we aimed to identify mirnas  associated with emphysema severity in copd patients. five mirnas were identified to be significantly down-regulated in lung from patients with moderate emphysema, compared with lung of mild emphysema patients. in addition, a negative correlation was noted in the expression of these mirnas and their putative target mrnas ex vivo. furthermore, increasing the expression of mir-34c  in respiratory cells resulted in decreased expression of predicted mrna targets in vitro, providing additional functional expression data. our data suggest modulation of serpine <dig> by mir-34c in vitro and ex vivo. dysregulation of serpine <dig> by mir-34c could therefore be a potential mechanism involved in emphysema severity and progression. to our knowledge, this is the first study to compare mirna profiles in the lungs of copd patients based on emphysema severity.

a major strength of this study was the ability to correlate mirna-mediated mrna regulation in the same lung samples. it is known that mirnas mediate gene silencing through translational inhibition and mrna degradation. in addition, target mrna is degraded in more than one third of genes that display translational repression  <cit> ; hence we have focused on studying changes in mrna expression as a consequence of altered mirna expression. mirnas that are down-regulated in a certain disease state  would be expected to upregulate expression of their predicted mrnas, in an orchestrated process of epigenetic regulation. this relationship of mirna and mrna expression has been demonstrated previously in airways from copd patients  <cit>  but not in peripheral lung tissue, which we used in this current study. of the mirnas identified as differentially expressed in lung between moderate vs mild emphysema patients in this study, mir-34c is particularly relevant to human lung disease, as its expression is increased during normal lung development  <cit> . we found decreased expression of mir-34c in lungs of patients with moderate emphysema, compared to mild emphysema. van pottelberge et al. also found greater than three-fold downregulation of mir-34c in sputum from smokers with copd, compared to those without copd, and a direct correlation between mir-34c expression and percent predicted fev <dig> <cit> . their findings support our study, since there was down-regulation of mir-34c expression in their copd patients, compared to controls, and also down-regulation in our moderate emphysema patients, compared to mild emphysema, indicating a similar continuum of expression with increasing disease severity. in the setting of reduced mir-34c expression in moderate emphysema lung , we were able to confirm increased gene expression of two of its predicted mrna targets, hnf <dig> and serpine <dig>  hnf4a  is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of cytokines involved in inflammation, as demonstrated in other organs ; its role in the lung is yet to be determined. serpine <dig> , member 1), also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor  <dig> , is a protease inhibitor, and inhibitor of fibrinolysis. pai- <dig> knockout mice demonstrate emphysema-like changes in the lung  <cit> , so our findings of increased serpine <dig> expression in moderate emphysema  may be unexpected, given the role of protease-antiprotease imbalance in the pathogenesis of emphysema. however, serpine <dig> is only one of a number of antiproteases, and has other roles in the lung that could be relevant to the progression of emphysema. for example, serpine <dig> has been shown to be upregulated in the lung or lung cells during hypoxia  <cit> , exposure to lipopolysaccharide or cigarette smoke extract  <cit> , or oxidative stress via nf-κb  <cit> . importantly, elevated levels of pai- <dig> in sputum have been observed in two separate studies of patients with copd   <cit> . furthermore, sputum pai- <dig> levels were higher in more severe copd , which would be in keeping with our findings of higher serpine <dig> expression in more severe emphysema  <cit> . other candidate emphysema severity mirnas identified in this study – mir-34b, mir-133a/b and mir- <dig> – have been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. for example, mir-34b expression was decreased in induced sputum from copd smokers compared to non-copd smokers  <cit> . down-regulation of mir-133a is associated with increased bronchial smooth muscle contraction in patients with asthma  <cit> . mir-133b negatively regulates the expression of transcription factor, pitx <dig> <cit> , which activates the dopamine receptor , a mediator of nicotine addiction in smokers  <cit> . overall, emerging evidence of the biological roles of these mirnas supports the plausibility of their involvement in lung diseases.

a number of potential limitations of this study should be addressed.  a physiological measure of emphysema  was used to stratify patients, as in our previous study  <cit> , rather than pathological examination of lung tissue. the reason for this was that these lung tissue samples were not inflated at harvesting, making morphological assessment of emphysema severity difficult. however, gas transfer is routinely used clinically as a measure of emphysema severity in copd patients.  although a relatively small number of samples was used , the fdrs of the  <dig> mirnas were all < <dig> ; furthermore, the two mirnas tested  were technically validated independently using qrt-pcr.  no overlap was found between the mir-34c targets that were enriched in ex vivo lung samples and in vitro cell lines. it should be noted that the ex vivo study used operon microarrays which represented only  <dig>  genes. furthermore, our in vitro study used commercial cell lines, and all of our copd lung samples were from patients who also had lung cancer. despite these potential limitations, we found that the expression of five candidate genes in vitro correlated with ex vivo profiles in both in-house  <cit>  and external datasets .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, mirna expression is associated with increasing emphysema severity in copd patients. increasing mir-34c expression in vitro in respiratory cell lines decreased the expression of its predicted targets, consistent with mirna-mediated regulation of mrna. additionally, we have shown by qrt-pcr that serpine <dig> expression is increased in lung from patients with increasing severity of emphysema, in whom mir-34c expression is low. future studies should aim to directly demonstrate mir-34c-mediated serpine <dig> regulation in emphysema and evaluate the pathogenetic role of other mirnas, with the goal of identifying potentially important targets for more effective treatment of copd.
