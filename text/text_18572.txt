BACKGROUND
the fox genes are members of the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors, characterised by a  <dig> amino acid dna binding domain  <cit> . fox genes have been identified in the genomes of animals and fungi, but not plants. animals appear to have more fox genes than fungi, with four genes identified in saccharomyces and schizosaccharomyces, at least  <dig> in the cnidarian sea anemone nematostella vectensis,  <dig> in drosophila melanogaster,  <dig> in ciona intestinalis and over  <dig> in the human and other vertebrate genomes  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the forkhead domains has lead to placement of most of these genes into  <dig> subclasses named foxa to foxs, with a small number of 'orphan' genes of unclear relationships defying classification  <cit> . these studies show vertebrate genomes contain more fox genes than the genomes of other animals, suggesting an expansion that mirrors the increase in gene numbers seen for other gene families  <cit> . two competing theories for how this increase in gene number took place are that two whole genome duplications  occurred early in the vertebrate lineage  <cit> , or that continuous gene duplications occurred throughout vertebrate evolution  <cit> . the 2r hypothesis predicts that a 1: <dig> ratio of genes should have been present in an ancestral vertebrate when compared to an invertebrate, and that in molecular phylogenetic trees these paralogues would adopt a specific topology reflecting the history of duplication  <cit> . while the identification of blocks of paralogous genes has been interpreted as evidence in favour of wgd  <cit> , paralagous gene sets often adopt different topologies  <cit> , and multiple independent duplications could also explain the observed data.

previously it has been reported that the human representatives of four fox subclasses, foxc, foxf, foxl <dig> and foxq <dig>  are localised to two small regions of the human genome; specifically, the genes foxc <dig>  foxf <dig> and foxq <dig> are found on chromosome  <dig> within  <dig> kb, while the genes foxl <dig>  foxc <dig>  foxf <dig> are found on chromosome  <dig> within  <dig> kb  <cit> . recently, we have shown that the amphioxus orthologues of these genes are found clustered in one region of the amphioxus genome, suggesting block duplication of this region in the vertebrates underlies the evolution of the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> loci  <cit> . under the 2r hypothesis, however, four such loci would be predicted. this discrepancy could be explained by gene loss.

to investigate this, we carried out a detailed comparative genomic survey of the human chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> fox cluster loci. genes around each locus were identified, and their evolutionary history established by database searches and molecular phylogenetics. this revealed two additional human loci containing genes paralagous to those found adjacent to the clustered fox genes. all four loci were then compared to the genomes of other vertebrates, including other mammals and xenopus tropicalis, gallus gallus, fugu rubripes, danio rerio and tetraodon nigroviridis. this allowed us to identify orthologous regions in all these animal genomes, and to show teleost genomes have undergone further duplications. by comparing these loci, we are now able to establish the pattern of clustered fox gene duplication and loss through multiple vertebrate lineages. furthermore, a previously orphan gene, foxs <dig>  was identified as a likely remnant of cluster duplication.

RESULTS
identification of human fox cluster paralogons
gene maps pertaining to this section are summarised in figure  <dig>  our searches identified  <dig> gene families that showed evidence of genomic co-localisation with the fox clusters; the neighbour of cox  genes, the cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  genes, the dual specificity phosphatase  genes, the interferon regulatory factor  genes and the myosin light chain kinase  genes. phylogenetic analyses of these families are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  to summarise, the noc genes are found on the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  and the cox <dig> genes are found on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  though their exact positions relative to the other genes differ. dusp genes are found next to the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> clusters . each locus on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contains an irf gene . the mlck genes are found by the chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig>  clusters while a third gene, mlckf <dig> is found on chromosome  <dig>  though this last gene is not tightly linked to the rest of the cluster . furthermore, another fox gene, foxs <dig>  which has been previously regarded as an orphan  <cit> , was identified adjacent to irf <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  we therefore conclude regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> shown in figure  <dig> are the likely remaining paralogous genomic regions  of the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> fox cluster regions.

orthologous paralogons in mammals, chicken, xenopus and teleosts
conserved genomic regions to the four human loci described above were identified in the m. musculus, x. tropicalis, g. gallus, f. rubripes, d. rerio and t. nigroviridis genomes. these are summarised in figure  <dig>  we also examined chimp, dog and cow genomes. gene organisation appeared similar to that in mouse and human , and hence we have omitted them from the following sections. further details of the phylogenetic analyses that confirm orthology and paralogy relationships are shown in the additional files that accompany this report. below, we summarise the salient features of each orthologous set. in addition to the paralagous genes described in humans above, we also utilised other genes present in these genomic regions to re-enforce evidence of orthology.

genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 6
this region consists of dusp <dig>  irf <dig>  exco <dig>  foxq <dig>  foxf <dig>  foxc <dig>  gmds and mlckf <dig>  genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome  <dig> are summarised in figure 2a. a region of mouse chromosome  <dig>  showed the order and intergenic distance of these genes to be comparable in these mammals. in the chicken, a region of chromosome  <dig> is orthologous to the same region, and includes the linked foxf <dig> and foxq <dig> genes. a chicken foxc <dig> gene was identified in a previous study  <cit> , however its genomic position is currently unknown. we also note a large gap in the sequence between chicken foxf <dig> and gmds, and suggest chicken foxc <dig> may reside here. in x. tropicalis this region is contained on two scaffolds; dusp <dig>  irf <dig> and exco <dig> are on scaffold  <dig>  and foxq <dig>  foxf <dig>  foxc <dig>  gmds and mlckf <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  high quality sequence is present for  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb past the final genes on each respective scaffold. however, as the gap between exoc <dig> and foxq <dig> can exceed  <dig> kb in mammals, this does not preclude the linkage of these regions in the x. tropicalis genome.

a region in the d. rerio genome was identified on chromosome  <dig>  extending from irf <dig> to mlckf <dig> and included identical gene organisation but relatively small intergenic distances when compared to tetrapods. foxq <dig>  foxf <dig> and foxc1b are present in the expected positions. an additional contig containing linked irf <dig>  and dusp <dig> orthologs was also identified. in the t. nigroviridis genome, two fox clusters orthologous to human chromosome  <dig> were identified, one on chromosome  <dig>  and one on unassigned scaffold  <dig>  an additional unassigned scaffold contains irf4a and dusp <dig>  and could also be part of the chromosome  <dig> region as sequence quality is low adjacent to foxq <dig>  this is supported by the f. rubripes arrangement, in which the orthologous genes are found on one scaffold.

in summary, we found evidence for single genomic regions orthologous to the fox cluster region of human chromosome  <dig> in tetrapods, while in teleost fish we found evidence for the presence of two such regions, in keeping with the additional genome duplication proposed to have occurred in this lineage  <cit> .

genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 20
this region consists of dusp <dig>  irf <dig>  foxs <dig>  mlck <dig>  tpx <dig>  bcl <dig> and cox4i <dig>  genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome  <dig> are summarised in figure 2b. a region of mouse chromosome  <dig>  showed the order and intergenic distance of these genes to be comparable in these mammals. an exception is that no irf <dig> gene was identified in this region of the mouse genome. in the chicken a single orthologous region was identified on chromosome  <dig>  and included a foxs <dig> orthologue. however we were unable to identify a cox4i <dig> gene. in x. tropicalis, two scaffolds  were identified as orthologous to this human region; these do not overlap in gene content, hence we infer they derive from one region of orthology. foxs <dig> was not found in the x. tropicalis genome.

evidence for orthologous regions in teleost genomes is weaker. a tenuous orthology region may exist in the d. rerio genome, as bcl <dig> and cox <dig> genes exhibit tight linkage on chromosome  <dig>  an irf <dig> orthologue is also on chromosome  <dig>  but at  <dig>  mb from the other genes, this linkage is unlikely to be significant. in t. nigroviridis and f. rubripes, we were only able to identify irf <dig> orthologues.

genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 16
this region contains psf <dig>  noc <dig>  cox4i <dig>  irf <dig>  foxf <dig>  flj <dig>  foxc <dig> and foxl <dig>  genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome  <dig> are summarised in figure 2c. investigation of mammalian genomes showed regions of chromosome  <dig> of the mouse  to be comparable in gene order and intergenic distance to the genes on human chromosome  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> of the chicken genome has a region orthologous to human chromosome  <dig>  comprising of psf <dig>  noc <dig>  cox4i <dig>  irf <dig> and foxf <dig>  however part of this region is inverted in comparison to mammalian genomes. similarity past foxf <dig> extends to a region containing flj <dig>  which is found between foxf <dig> and foxc <dig> in the human genome. a chicken foxl <dig> is yet to be identified, however the sequence quality upstream of foxf <dig> in the chicken genome is poor.

orthologous regions in the x. tropicalis genome are recovered from three separate scaffolds: s <dig> containing psf <dig>  noc <dig>  cox4i <dig> and a dusp family member. s <dig> contains irf <dig>  foxf <dig> and flj <dig> and s <dig> contains the foxc <dig> and foxl <dig> genes. truncation of scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> at the irf <dig> end do not preclude close linkage, however good sequence quality past flj <dig> and before foxc <dig> suggest these regions, if linked, are minimally  <dig>  mb apart.

in d. rerio, an orthologous region on chromosome  <dig> matches the human arrangement from psf <dig> to a region with similarity to flj <dig> with the exceptions that d. rerio  also has a dusp gene in this region, and that irf <dig> is absent and instead found on a contig yet to be assigned to a chromosome. sequence quality past foxf <dig> appears to be high, however no foxc <dig> has been found in the genome of these teleosts. foxc <dig> is present in the basal actinopterygian a. calva , showing loss of foxc <dig> to be specific to teleosts. a foxl <dig> gene has been identified on chromosome  <dig>  the arrangement in t. nigroviridis and f. rubripes is similar except irf <dig> is included in these clusters.

in summary, we find good evidence for orthologous regions to the human chromosome  <dig> fox cluster region in the genomes of tetrapods and teleosts. however teleosts appear to have split this region between flj <dig> and foxl <dig>  an alternate explanation for this apparent split is they are remnants of the proposed teleost tetraplody, with reciprocal gene loss yielding non-overlapping gene sets. higher quality genome assemblies will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.

genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome 14
this region consists of psme <dig>  noc <dig>  psme <dig>  rf <dig> and irf <dig>  genomic regions orthologous to human chromosome  <dig> are summarised in figure 2d. regions identified on mouse chromosome  <dig> , suggest preservation of this orthologous region in mammals. we were unable to identify a similar orthologous region  in the chicken genome, however a similar region was identified in the genome of x. tropicalis, suggesting the chicken has either lost these genes, or they are not included in the current assembly and associated sequence data. the d. rerio genome contains an irf <dig>  noc <dig>  psme <dig> orthology group on chromosome  <dig>  with an inversion between irf <dig> and psme <dig>  a second region on chromosome  <dig> includes a noc <dig> gene linked to a psme <dig> gene. the t. nigroviridis and f. rubripes genomes also contain a single region including irf <dig>  noc <dig> and psme <dig>  but with an inversion between noc <dig> and psme <dig> 

discussion
human paralogons and orthologous regions in other vertebrates: gene duplication and gene loss
here we report the results of a comparative analysis of vertebrate fox cluster loci. first we identified four putative paralogons in the human genome; on chromosome  <dig> ; on chromosome  <dig> ; on chromosome  <dig> ; and on chromosome  <dig> . of these, that on chromosome  <dig> has the weakest supporting evidence, though irf gene phylogenetics and the preservation of noc <dig> and irf <dig> linkage in other genomes supports its status as a paralagous region.

we also identified putative orthologous regions in the genomes of other vertebrates. organisation in all mammals examined was very similar to that in human. in the tetrapods g. gallus and x. tropicalis, gene organisation was consistent with the ancestral tetrapod genome including a single copy of all four regions  <cit> . some lineage specific changes are also inferred, and one paralogon is currently missing in g. gallus. the situation in the teleost genomes is more complex, with two putative orthologous regions identified for some of the loci. the teleost lineage is hypothesised to have undergone an additional genome duplication  <cit> , and the pattern of orthologous regions we observed is consistent with this, though this would imply significant gene loss from several duplicated regions. consistent with this we note that as high as 85% gene loss have been suggested for the teleosts following wgd  <cit> .

the evolutionary relationship of foxs1
foxs <dig> has previously been named in humans as fkhl <dig>  <cit>  and in mouse as fkh <dig>  <cit> , however its phylogenetic relationship to fox genes in more distant taxa has remained unresolved  <cit> . our study extends the number of known foxs <dig> genes to chimp, cow, dog and chicken orthologues, indicating the gene is at least as old as the mammal and bird lineage divergence. the consistent placement of foxs <dig> in a genomic region paralagous to the clustered fox genes suggests its evolutionary origin from the original fox gene cluster. this is because the presence of orthologous regions in tetrapod and teleosts imply the origin of these paralogons, including the foxs <dig> gene, via duplication prior to the separation of the actinopterygian and sarcopterygian lineages. assuming this, it is possible the original pre-duplication fox gene cluster included five genes , and that these have been fragmented by duplication and reciprocal gene loss. a literal interpretation of fox gene phylogeny supports this view, as the foxs <dig> genes group together, well separated from the other fox subclasses. however, fox gene phylogenies  are necessarily based on the relatively short sequence of the forkhead domain. rapid divergence could lead to long branch attraction artefacts in such phylogenies, and hence we consider it possible that foxs <dig> is paralagous to foxc, foxl <dig>  foxf or foxq <dig>  and that this relationship has become obscured.

furthermore, no foxs <dig> gene was recovered from the genomes of the teleosts or of x. tropicalis. we are currently unable to determine if this gene has been lost from these lineages, or is present but has not yet been sequenced. if the latter, the sequence quality in x. tropicalis and t. nigroviridis renders it unlikely it exists in the orthologous region of these genomes. this would raise a third possibility, that foxs <dig> had independently translocated into this genomic region after the separation of the amphibian and amniote lineages. sequencing of further vertebrate genomes may help resolve this issue.

fox cluster break-up in vertebrates
retention of linkage between clustered fox genes observed in humans, amphioxus and some insects has been hypothesised to have been constrained by co-ordinated regulation, analogous to that suggested for the homeobox genes  <cit> . our results show the retention of fox clusters in mammals. the chicken genome assembly is currently of insufficient quality to determine if the fox clusters are intact, however in x. tropicalis, while foxq1-foxf2-foxc <dig> linkage is maintained, the foxf <dig> and foxc2-foxl <dig> genes are separated by at least  <dig>  mb, and could lie on different chromosomes.

in all three teleost genomes we found evidence for foxq1-foxf2-foxc <dig> linkage, however again the foxf1-foxc2-foxl <dig> cluster appears broken, and foxc <dig> appears to have been lost. in conclusion, our data do not disprove the possibility of constraint on the organisation of the foxq1-foxf2-foxc <dig> genes, but suggest such constraints, if they exist, are less likely on the organisation of the foxf1-foxc2-foxl <dig> genes.

in summary, our data are consistent with the origin of paralagous regions via duplication of large regions of dna. the timing of the duplications is consistent with that proposed for three of the genome duplications suggested to have occurred in vertebrate evolution, but also consistent with independent block duplication of this genomic region. based on the pattern of duplication, we have constructed a model indicating how the fox cluster locus evolved in vertebrates . duplication of the whole region to yield four copies is inferred to have occurred by the base of bony vertebrates. considerable gene loss is then inferred before the radiation of bony vertebrates. subsequent losses and inversions in different vertebrate lineages are indicated in the figure.

CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive analysis of the human fox cluster loci has identified  <dig> paralogons,  <dig> containing fox genes and one fox-less 'cryptic paralogon'. extension of this comparison to other vertebrates has allowed a model for the evolution of this genomic region to be constructed, indicating patterns of gene duplication, loss, inversion and fox cluster break up. to obtain a more complete picture of the evolution of the fox clusters we note the importance of including basal actinopterygian, chondrichthian and agnathan data in future analyses to gain a greater understanding of the evolutionary history and timing of these events.
