BACKGROUND
during development, the vertebrate hindbrain is transiently divided into a series of lineage-restricted segments, termed rhombomeres, through the expression of distinct transcription factors. notably, anterior-posterior patterning and segmentation of the hindbrain is critical in appropriately specifying neuronal cell types  <cit> . the identity of each hindbrain segment is regulated by the hox family of homeobox transcription factors, the anterior expression limits of which correlate precisely with rhombomere boundaries  <cit> . the correct complement of hox genes expressed within each hindbrain segment specifies the identity of cells within that segment by activating regional expression of cell migration and axon guidance molecules. blocking the functions of hox proteins or their pbx  and meis  cofactors within the hindbrain leads to changes in rhombomere identity and corresponding defects in cranial motor neuron migration and axon guidance  <cit> .

the vitamin a-derived morphogen retinoic acid  regulates anterior-posterior patterning of the neural tube, including defining regional identity of hindbrain segments  <cit> . for example, vitamin a-deficient quail embryos lack posterior rhombomeres r4-r <dig>  <cit> . maintaining the precise level of retinoic acid is critical, with increased levels known to result in teratogenic defects of the forebrain, heart, and eyes  <cit> . in the hindbrain, segmentation defects associated with changes in retinoic acid are attributed to alterations in hox gene expression  <cit> . for example, an increase in retinoic acid levels causes expansion of the posterior hindbrain hox- <dig> expression  <cit> , while a deficiency in retinoic acid causes an embryonic loss of hox- <dig>  hox- <dig>  and hox- <dig> paralog expression domains  <cit> .

regional specificity of retinoic acid signaling is achieved in part through restricted domains of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase proteins , the enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting step in ra synthesis  <cit> . pharmacologic blockade of raldh activity using diethylaminobenzaldehyde  results in ablation of the posterior hindbrain, a phenotype that is highly analogous to the vitamin a-deficient quail  <cit> . the heme-thiolate family of cytochrome p <dig> type  <dig> enzymes  hydroxylate ra, a modification that targets it for degradation  <cit> . the forebrain, midbrain and anterior hindbrain express cyp <dig> genes, thereby blocking ra signaling in these regions  <cit> . the combined activity of posteriorly expressed aldh1a with anterior-specific cyp <dig> genes creates a defined zone of ra signaling within the presumptive hindbrain. ra activity is mediated intracellularly by two nuclear receptor families, retinoid-x-receptor  and retinoic acid receptor   <cit> . ligand-bound heterodimeric rxr:rar complexes activate transcription of genes containing retinoic acid response elements . analysis of conserved non-coding elements surrounding hox- <dig> and hox- <dig> paralogs has identified rares that are essential to rhombomere-specific expression of hox-1/hox- <dig> genes in the hindbrain  <cit> . in support, alterations in ra levels result in profound defects to hox- <dig> and hox- <dig> gene expression domains  <cit> .

although the role and requirement of retinoic acid metabolism genes during embryogenesis has been extensively studied, the factors acting to initiate and maintain expression of ra metabolism genes remain largely unknown. within vertebrates, transcription factors from the zic  family of transcription factors are dynamically expressed in partially overlapping regions of the neural tube, indicative of a role in neural development. recent evidence suggests a connection between zic transcription factors and the retinoic acid signaling pathway: maurus et al. demonstrated that loss of zebrafish zic <dig> causes a decrease in presumptive forebrain expression of cyp26a <dig> and an increase in ra signaling as detected by rare:egfp transgenics  <cit> . further, mutations in human zic <dig> result in holoprosencephaly , a forebrain defect where the cerebral hemispheres fail to separate during development  <cit>  and hpe phenotypes have been connected to aberrant ra signaling, thus providing a plausible link between zic <dig> and retinoic acid metabolism  <cit> . based on these observations, we tested the hypothesis that zic transcription factors play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of ra metabolism gene expression during zebrafish embryogenesis. the data presented here demonstrate that zebrafish zic <dig> genes act upstream of retinoic acid metabolism and suggest a novel regulatory interaction between zic2a and zic2b transcription factors and the ra-synthesizing gene aldh1a <dig>  further, we show that zic <dig> signaling is necessary for proper hindbrain patterning.

RESULTS
zic transcription factors are expressed during the initiation of ra metabolism genes
retinoic acid levels are regulated by the precise action of synthesis and hydroxylation genes. aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a <dig> , the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of retinal to retinoic acid  <cit> . the transcription of aldh1a <dig> is initiated early in development, with expression at the embryonic margin at 5 hours post fertilization   and in lateral plate mesoderm by  <dig> hpf –  <dig> hpf   <cit> . beginning at  <dig> hpf, aldh1a <dig> expression is restricted to the dorsal retina and anterior somites . retinoic acid degradation occurs following its hydroxylation by the cytochrome p <dig> oxidase, cyp26a <dig>  cyp26a <dig> transcription is initiated early during zebrafish embryogenesis, starting with the presumptive anterior neural ectoderm at  <dig> hpf   <cit> . by early somitogenesis , cyp26a <dig> mrna is found in the presumptive forebrain, midbrain, anterior hindbrain, and part of the tailbud . at the later somitogenesis stages of 16- <dig> hpf, its expression becomes restricted to parts of the retina, caudal notochord, and tailbud .

to ascertain whether zic transcription factors could regulate embryonic initiation of ra metabolism, we first examined which of the seven zebrafish zics are present during the time when cyp26a <dig> and aldh1a <dig> mrna expression are initiated. using in situ hybridization in conjunction with known expression data, we determined that zic <dig>  zic2a, zic2b, and zic <dig> are the best candidates for driving initiation of ra metabolism genes because they are expressed at the earliest stages of development  <cit> . zic2a, zic2b, and zic <dig> are all expressed broadly by  <dig> hpf, while zic <dig> expression is not detectable . by 8- <dig> hpf, zic <dig> and zic2a are expressed in discrete regions consistent with cyp26a <dig> expression within the anterior neural ectoderm . zic2b and zic <dig> show broad dorsal expression domains by  <dig> hpf, in regions that overlap with both anterior expression of cyp26a <dig> and the more posterior expression domain of aldh1a <dig> . as development continues, the zics display expression within the dorsal hindbrain, extending down the spinal cord in varying levels and degrees, showing less obvious overlap with cyp26a <dig> and aldh1a <dig> . overall, these data show that zic2a/2b/ <dig> transcription factor expression is consistent both temporally and spatially with the initiation of expression of cyp26a <dig> and aldh1a <dig>  to ensure that zic gene expression corresponds to the same germ layers as cyp26a <dig> and aldh1a <dig>  we sectioned 90% epiboly  embryos following in situ hybridization. while cyp26a <dig> is expressed in the epiblast, and aldh1a <dig> is limited to the hypoblast, zic2a and zic2b are present diffusely in both germ layers and are therefore co-expressed with both ra metabolism genes .

zics act upstream of early retinoic acid metabolism genes, cyp26a <dig> and aldh1a2
based on our observations of zic gene expression, the earliest expressed genes zic2a, zic2b, and zic <dig> were examined for possible roles in the initiation of ra metabolism. due to the propensity for functional redundancy, we chose first to simultaneously knock down three transcription factors, zic2a, zic2b, and zic <dig> with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. upon examining resulting phenotypes, we determined that zic <dig> depletion is dispensable, and the zic <dig> morpholino was removed from the injection mixture. interestingly, embryos injected with splice-blocking morpholinos for zic2a and zic2b display a reduction in cyp26a <dig>  and aldh1a <dig>  expression by  <dig> hpf. while both the cyp26a <dig> expression level and domain are reduced, the aldh1a <dig> expression domain is reduced in size, but normal in intensity of staining. results from quantitative real-time pcr showed a 29% reduction in aldh1a <dig> expression in zic2a2b-depleted embryos as compared to control embryos  . the downregulation of aldh1a <dig> expression in zic2a2b-depleted embryos can be observed as late as  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf ; however it is not as profound as the reduction seen in  <dig> hpf embryos.

zic depletion causes mild alterations to retinoic acid-responsive genes and hindbrain patterning
as aldh1a <dig> and cyp26a <dig> have opposing effects on ra levels, the knockdown of either gene alone would be expected to produce opposite phenotypes. however, since zic2a2b depletion reduces both ra metabolism genes simultaneously, the outcome for ra signaling is difficult to predict. thus, we performed in situ hybridization for retinoic acid-responsive genes to ascertain the overall level of retinoic acid signaling in zic-depleted embryos. previous work demonstrated that the expression levels of zebrafish meis <dig>  hoxb1a, hoxd4a, and hnf1ba correlate with changing retinoic acid levels . our results show a strong reduction in meis <dig> and a mild reduction in hoxd4a expression within the presumptive hindbrain following zic2a2b knockdown . two other retinoic acid-responsive genes, hoxb1a and hnf1ba, did not show significant changes in expression with zic2a2b morpholino when compared to uninjected controls . to determine whether the reductions in meis <dig> and hoxd4a are caused by changes to retinoic acid signaling, we treated zic2a2b morphants with  <dig> nm retinoic acid. indeed,  <dig> nm ra is able to rescue the expression of meis <dig> and hoxd4a to levels similar to those seen in our uninjected controls . in addition, morpholino knockdown of aldh1a <dig> causes a similar reduction in meis <dig> and hoxd4a to that seen in zic2a2b morphants . thus, our data strongly argue that zic2a2b promote the expression of ra-responsive genes through aldh1a <dig> 

we took advantage of manipulating ra levels to further examine the regulatory loops present in the early zebrafish embryo. given that zic2a2b morpholinos cause a loss in cyp26a <dig> expression, it is plausible that this causes an indirect effect on the aldh1a <dig> domain. to test this, we examined expression of aldh1a <dig> in mutants lacking cyp26a <dig>  notably, aldh1a <dig> levels are unaffected in cyp26a <dig> mutants, arguing against a scenario whereby the aldh1a <dig> reduction in zic2a2b morphants occurs because of reduced hydroxylation of ra by cyp26a <dig> .

based on the observation that retinoic acid signaling is reduced in zic2a2b morphants, we examined whether zic2a2b depletion also led to defects in hindbrain patterning. in situ hybridization for hindbrain markers  was performed to examine hindbrain segmentation and rhombomere morphology . we found that all rhombomeres are formed, but that rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  are reduced in size  and there is reduced hoxa2b expression within r2-r <dig> . in addition, hoxb4a expression within the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord is also reduced . other regions within the hindbrain appear normal as observed through appropriate marker expression patterns . this suggests that although there is a reduction in the posterior neural domain, the reduction of retinoic acid signaling in zic2a2b morphants does not lead to a complete loss of posterior regions.

zic2a2b depletion reduces retinoic acid signaling
the transgenic zebrafish line tgsk <dig> contains twelve retinoic acid response elements  upstream of a ubiquitous promoter linked to the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein, egfp <cit> . active retinoic acid signaling in tgsk <dig> fish can be detected either directly by observation of egfp fluorescence, or by in situ hybridization for egfp mrna. the sensitivity of this transgenic line was examined by assaying its response to alterations in retinoic acid levels . in  <dig> and  <dig> hpf control embryos, the predominant regions of retinoic acid signaling are within the spinal cord and posterior hindbrain . as expected, the fluorescence domain is increased at both stages in response to retinoic acid treatment, expanding further anteriorly into the hindbrain and posteriorly down the spinal cord . at  <dig> hpf, there are additional retinoic acid signaling centers within the dorsal and ventral eye . here, exogenous addition of retinoic acid results in morphologically smaller eyes and loss of the dorsal expression domain, while the ventral egfp-positive region is maintained . blocking retinoic acid synthesis with deab treatment results in a loss of all retinoic acid signaling, with no fluorescence or in situ coloration visible at  <dig> hpf or  <dig> hpf . these results demonstrate that the tgsk <dig> zebrafish line is a suitable tool for studying retinoic acid signaling. of note, we were unable to detect the transgene before  <dig> hpf, preventing the analysis of retinoic acid signaling levels at early embryonic stages, when retinoic acid metabolism genes are first transcribed.

as the tg transgenic line labels posterior retinoic acid signaling regions, we asked whether the reduction in retinoic acid metabolism genes following zic depletion leads to an alteration in later embryonic retinoic acid signaling levels. as compared to control egfp levels , there is a strong reduction in egfp expression in 75% of the zic2a2b morphant embryos at  <dig> hpf . this suggests that there is a reduction in retinoic acid signaling within the zic2a2b-depleted hindbrain at later stages. to test the hypothesis that the reduction in retinoic acid signaling in zic2a2b morphants is a result of reduced aldh1a <dig> expression, we compared retinoic acid signaling between aldh1a2-depleted and cyp26a1-depleted embryos. egfp levels appear only slightly affected in cyp26a <dig> mo-injected embryos as compared to control . however, strikingly, there is a strong reduction in retinoic acid signaling levels across both zic2a2b and aldh1a <dig> knockdowns, as shown by strong reduction of egfp transcript as compared to controls . taken together, these data show that we have identified a novel regulatory mechanism whereby zic2a2b regulates retinoic acid levels, most likely through the regulation of aldh1a <dig> transcription.

vagal neurons are sensitive to alterations in retinoic acid levels
our results demonstrated strong deficits in ra signaling at  <dig> hpf, a key time-point for specification and differentiation of hindbrain branchiomotor neurons  <cit> . to determine the developmental consequence of the reduction in retinoic acid signaling, we chose to examine development of vagal motor neurons within the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord  <cit> . using the tg transgenic line, we sought to analyze development of hindbrain branchiomotor neurons by confocal microscopy in response to zic2a2b depletion  <cit> . in control embryos, trigeminal neuron cell bodies are located within rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  facial neurons within rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  and the vagal neuron domain extends from the posterior hindbrain down the spinal cord . to estimate the number of vagal neurons, we used imagej to quantify the area and length of the vagal neuron cluster . upon treatment with retinoic acid, the vagal domain is greatly expanded and more neuronal cell bodies are visible as compared to control . the average area in dmso-treated control embryos is 5481 μm <dig>  and the anterior-posterior length is 165 μm . treatment with ra results in an average area of  <dig>  μm <dig>  and length of 214 μm . alternatively, treatment with deab, a pharmacological inhibitor of retinoic acid synthesis, significantly alters embryonic patterning such that all posterior rhombomeres are lost. the vagal domain is almost undetectable in these embryos . deab treatment also results in mispatterning of anterior branchiomotor neuron classes such that it is difficult to identify trigeminal, facial, and possible remnants of vagal neuron populations. as a best estimate, the area of vagal neurons in deab-treated embryos is 1683 μm <dig>  and length is 65 μm .

zic2a2b knockdown causes loss of vagal neurons
zic2a2b-depleted embryos have reduced retinoic acid signaling levels within the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord. to ascertain whether this reduction in retinoic acid signaling causes a concomitant defect in vagal motor neurons, zic2a2b knockdown was introduced in tg transgenic zebrafish. embryos were grown in media containing dmso  or treated with exogenous retinoic acid  or deab  to determine if retinoic acid supplementation could rescue phenotypes. zic-depleted embryos have significantly reduced vagal neuron area and length as compared to control embryos . the average area of the vagal neuron domain in zic-depleted embryos is 4979 μm <dig>  as compared to  <dig>  μm <dig>  in controls. the average length of the vagal neuron domain is  <dig>  μm  as compared to  <dig>  μm  in controls . this reduction in the vagal neuron domain would be expected with a mild reduction in retinoic acid levels. in many cases, the medial-lateral width of each vagal population was increased in morphants, suggesting a possible migrational error, as vagal neurons are typically formed medially and migrate laterally during development  <cit> . the physiological level of retinoic acid is estimated to be 3 nm  <cit> . due to reduced retinoic levels in zic-depleted embryos, we postulated that supplementation with near physiological levels  of retinoic acid  may be sufficient to rescue the neural phenotype seen. there is a mild increase in vagal neuron area and length in control embryos in response to  <dig> nm retinoic acid treatment . strikingly, with low dose treatment of retinoic acid, the vagal neuron area of zic-depleted embryos is rescued to values similar to those seen in control embryos: ra-treated, zic-depleted embryos have an average vagal neuron area of of  <dig>  μm <dig>  as compared to an average area in control embryos of  <dig>  μm <dig>  or  <dig>  μm <dig>  in dmso-treated zic2a2b morphants. there is also a significant increase in the length of the vagal domain in zic2a2b morphants treated with retinoic acid as compared to morphants in dmso  conditions : ra-treated morphants have a vagal domain length of 156 μm , compared to 126 μm  for dmso-treated morphants. while the domain length after ra treatment is similar to that of untreated control embryos, it is still significantly reduced compared to control embryos treated with retinoic acid. we asked whether zic2a2b morphants had residual ra by treating them with deab. by further reducing retinoic acid levels with deab treatment, there is a roughly equivalent shrinkage of the vagal neuron domain in both zic2a2b morphants and control embryos .

our data is consistent with a model whereby zic2a and zic2b act upstream of retinoic acid metabolism by activating transcription of aldh1a <dig>  as shown, there is an early reduction in aldh1a <dig> transcript levels in zic2a2b morphants, and the reduction in retinoic acid signaling levels within tg transgenics is similar in zic2a2b and aldh1a2-depleted embryos. further, the reduction in vagal neurons in zic2a2b morphants is rescued by treatment with retinoic acid, the product of an aldh1a2-catalyzed reaction. to determine if this relationship between zic2a2b and aldh1a <dig> is maintained in later neurons, vagal neurons were examined in aldh1a <dig> morphant tg zebrafish. the aldh1a2-depleted embryos also show a statistically significant reduction in length of the vagal domain, very similar to that seen in zic2a2b-depleted embryos . the comparable reduction in vagal domain length supports the hypothesis that zic2a2b act upstream of aldh1a <dig>  taken together, our data show that the most posterior class of branchiomotor neurons, the vagal neurons, is sensitive to alterations in retinoic acid levels. increased retinoic acid causes an expansion in the area and length of the vagal neuronal population, while retinoic acid depletion reduces the population. consistent with this observation, the reduction in retinoic acid signaling levels in zic2a2b-depleted embryos elicits a reduction in the size of the vagal neuron domain. importantly, the vagal neuron domain in zic2a2b-depleted embryos can be rescued by supplementation of ra to physiological levels.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel regulatory mechanism between zic2a2b transcription factors and early retinoic acid signaling levels. we propose a model whereby zic2a and zic2b act upstream of both retinoic acid synthesis  and degradation  genes in an early embryo. we see a persistent reduction in retinoic acid signaling in zic2a2b morphants at  <dig> hpf that is similar to that observed in embryos depleted of the main retinoic acid synthesis enzyme, aldh1a <dig>  consistent with reduced retinoic acid levels, zic2a2b knockdown results in reduced vagal motor neuron formation within the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord. this phenotype is nearly identical to aldh1a2-depleted embryos and is rescued by exogenous retinoic acid treatment.

while the role and requirement for retinoic acid metabolism genes has been well studied, less is known about the upstream regulators of these factors. during mouse development, hoxa1-pbx <dig>  complexes directly regulate raldh <dig> transcription within mesodermal tissue  <cit> . additionally, deficiencies in zebrafish tgif and hmx <dig> cause defects associated with reduced retinoic acid levels and reduced aldh1a <dig> transcription  <cit> . interestingly, tgif-depletion also results in a concomitant reduction in cyp26a <dig> mrna levels, similar to defects observed in zic-depleted embryos. as expected, the cyp26a <dig> murine mutant has defects associated with increased retinoic acid levels  <cit> . more notably, rescue of these defects is observed with heterozygous disruption of aldh1a <dig> in a cyp26a <dig> murine mutant, suggesting co-dependency between these genes, where less retinoic acid degradation is necessary when retinoic acid synthesis is reduced  <cit> . thus, the fact that the transcription factors zic2a and zic2b regulate expression of both retinoic acid and synthesis genes strongly suggests that they play an important role in regulating retinoic acid levels during early embryogenesis.

holoprosencephaly  is the most common forebrain birth defect, occurring when the cerebral hemispheres fail to separate. mutations in human zic <dig> and tgif are known to cause hpe. our results from zebrafish studies provide evidence that both of these genes function to regulate ra metabolism  <cit> . although both zic and tgif genes are implicated in regulating multiple signaling pathways, it is now plausible that altered levels of ra predispose embryos to hpe.
