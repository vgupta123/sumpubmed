BACKGROUND
detecting motifs with a significantly unexpected frequency in dna sequences has become a very common task in genome analysis. it is generally addressed to propose candidate functional motifs based on their statistical properties  <cit> . lots of statistical methods have been developed to that purpose  and satisfactory solutions exist now to find exceptional motifs thanks to p-value calculations.

more recently, a new related question has arisen in the literature concerning the comparison of motif exceptionalities in two sequences. one wants for instance to compare particular sets of genes  <cit> , upstream regions of cdss versus whole chromosome  <cit> , structural domains  <cit> , cdss versus intergenic regions, conserved regions versus strain-specific regions of bacterial genomes  <cit> , or chromosomes from the same species  <cit> . chromosomes from different species can also be compared from a comparative genomics point of view. in all these works, one would like to know if a given motif is significantly more exceptional in one sequence compared to another one. this criterion is usually used to identify motifs which are specific from some regions or expected to be more frequent in some particular parts of the genome. transcription factor binding sites, for instance, are expected to be more frequent in upstream regions than along the whole genome.

surprisingly, no rigorous statistical method has been proposed yet to decide if a given motif, exact or not, is significantly more exceptional in one sequence compared to a second one. of course, two p-values can be calculated separately on each sequence to know if the motif is exceptional in these sequences but the difficult point is how to compare these two p-values from a statistical point of view. it is indeed not sufficient to make the difference or the ratio to know if the two p-values are significantly different; one needs a statistical test.

in this paper, we propose two statistical tests to compare the motif count exceptionalities in two independent sequences. in the results section, we first present the underlying model for motif occurrences and the null hypothesis to test, namely the motif is similarly exceptional in both sequences. then we derive an exact binomial test and an asymptotic likelihood ratio test adapted for frequent motifs. usage conditions and power of both tests are described in the discussion section, together with a more refined model for occurrences of overlapping words and the associated tests. an illustration of the method is finally given; we compare the octamer exceptionalities in two sets of regions  from the escherichia coli k <dig> leading strands. these two sets correspond to the mosaic structure of e. coli's genome when comparing the two strains k <dig> and o157:h7: the backbone represents the common regions whereas the loops are specific to the k <dig> strain. as a toy example all along this paper, we will treat in detail the case of the palindromic octamer cagcgctg which occurs respectively  <dig> times in the loops  and  <dig> times in the backbone .

RESULTS
poisson model
in sequence i, the motif count ni is supposed to have a poisson distribution with mean  λi. this distribution has been shown to fit correctly theoretical  as well as observed count distributions of non-overlapping words  <cit> ; a non-overlapping word is a word such that two occurrences of itself can not overlap in a sequence.

the mean count λi in sequence i must account for three parameters:  the length ℓi of the sequence,  the composition of the sequence,  the possible exceptionality of the motif in the sequence.

expected intensity
the composition of the sequence can be accounted for via the probability μi for the motif to occur at any position in the sequence under a simple model. the most popular models are markov chain models which can fit the frequencies in mono-, di-, tri-nucleotides, etc. indeed, the markov chain model of order m  takes the -mer composition into account. under such models, the occurrence probability μi of a h-letter motif w = w <dig> w <dig> ... wh on the {a, c, g, t} alphabet can be expressed in terms of counts of its subwords of length m and m +  <dig>  <cit> . for instance, here are the expression of μi in models m <dig>  m <dig> and m which fit respectively the composition in bases, in dinucleotides and in oligonucleotides of length h - 1:

m0:μi=∏j=1hniℓih,m1:μi=∏j=1h−1niℓi∏j=2h−1ni,m:μi=ninini,

where ni  denotes the count in sequence i.

if one does not want to account for the sequence composition , then μi simply depends on the motif, hence μ <dig> = μ <dig> = h.

the choice of the markov chain model depends on the sequence composition one wants to fit. for instance, model m <dig> is often used for coding dna sequences to take the codon bias into account. higher the model order, better the fit, but usually the model order is bounded either by h -  <dig> or because the sequence is too small .

exceptionality coefficient
when the motif is not exceptional with respect to the considered model, the mean count λi is simply ℓi μi. for exceptional motifs, i.e. motifs with an observed count ni far from its expectation ℓi μi, under a given model, the mean count λi should reflect this exceptionality.

we therefore introduce an exceptionality coefficient ki which allows λi to be greater  than the expected value:

λi : = ki ℓi μi.

in the following, parameters ℓi and μi will be supposed to be known a priori: they can be considered as two correction terms. the inference will only be made on ki.

hypothesis testing
comparing the  exceptionality of a motif in two sequences is equivalent to test the null hypothesis h <dig> = {k <dig> = k2}.

we emphasize that the respective values of k <dig> and k <dig> can be larger than one , smaller than one  or close to one . these values do not matter: our only concern is to know if they are significantly different or not.

exact binomial test
we first propose an exact test based on a general property of the poisson distribution. if n <dig> and n <dig> are two independent poisson counts with respective means λ <dig> and λ <dig>  the distribution of n <dig> given their sum n+ : = n <dig> + n <dig> is binomial  <cit> : n <dig> ~ ℬ

discussion
lrt distribution
the chi-square distribution of the lrt statistic is only asymptotic, so the actual level may be different from the nominal one . to measure this difference, we have calculated this actual level for different values of π <dig> and n+. since lrt is a function of n <dig>  the actual level can be derived from the exact distribution of n <dig> given n+ which is binomial .

regarding the motif cagcgctg, because π <dig> is about 15% , the picture is close to the right plot of figure 1; in fact, with a total count of  <dig>  the actual level is respectively  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for a nominal level α equal to  <dig> %, 1%, 5% and 10%.

lrt as a contrast measure
the lrt statistic can still be used as a contrast measure, i.e. a measure of the difference, between the two exceptionalities. for large values of n+ it is much faster and easier to compute than the binomial p-value. we will see in the illustration below that the two quantities are strongly correlated.

decidability limits for the binomial test
because the binomial test is exact, the actual and nominal levels are equal. the significance can then always be determined. it would be maximal when n <dig> = n+  and the corresponding p-value pb would be equal to π0n+

power
an important property for a statistical test is its ability to detect departure from the null hypothesis. this ability is measured by the power of the test which is the probability to exceed the significance threshold  when the true parameter satisfies h <dig>  in our case, the parameter of interest is

which is equal to π <dig> when k <dig> = k <dig>  so the departure from h <dig> will be measured by the ratio k1/k <dig> when it differs from  <dig> 

exact binomial
the motif cagcgctg occurs n+ =  <dig> times in the whole genome. in the different models considered in table  <dig>  probability π <dig> is between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. the power of the binomial test in this case can therefore be read in figure  <dig>  in the two top plots between the black and red solid lines. we see that a ratio k1/k <dig> =  <dig> can be detected with probability greater than 90%, while a ratio of  <dig>  will be detected with a bit more than 50% probability.

lrt
the same analysis can be made for the lrt tests. however, this only makes sense for sufficiently large n+, to guaranty the validity of the chi-square distribution.

case of overlapping words
compound poisson model
the distribution of overlapping word occurrences is better modeled by a compound poisson process  in the following way:

• the word occurs in clumps distributed according to a poisson process. the number of clumps ci in sequence i is hence a random poisson variable with mean denoted by λ˜

the clump sizes are supposed to be independent. parameter ai is the overlapping probability of the motif and can be calculated under various markovian models .

in this setting, the count ni is hence the sum of the sizes of ci clumps and has the polya-aeppli  distribution . we have  λ˜

tests
an overlapping word can occur with an exceptional frequency  because of an exceptional number of clumps or  because of exceptional sizes of clumps. then comparing the exceptionalities of an overlapping word in two sequences leads to compare the number of clumps c <dig> with c <dig>  and/or the sizes v1c's with v2c's.

comparison of the number of clumps
in this compound poisson model, the number of clumps in each sequence is poisson distributed. the comparison of the counts c <dig> and c <dig> is then exactly equivalent to the comparison of the counts n <dig> and n <dig> studied in the results section, replacing λi by λ˜

exact test for the overlapping probability under m00
the question is now to test the null hypothesis h <dig> = {a <dig> = a2}. this comparison is made conditionally to the observed counts n <dig> and n <dig>  it only makes sense if the motif occurs at least once in each sequence, i.e. if n <dig>  n <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> are all larger than   <dig>  in this case, the first occurrence necessarily corresponds to the first clump and the ci -  <dig> last clumps have to be chosen among the other ni -  <dig> motif occurrences. since a motif occurrence  corresponds to a clump occurrence with probability  <dig> - ai, the number of clumps  has a binomial distribution:

ci -  <dig> ~ ℬ

which means that the expected number of clumps decreases when the overlapping probability increases.

following the same strategy as for the non-overlapping case, we base our test on the distribution of c <dig> given the total clump count c+ = c <dig> + c <dig>  under h <dig>   has an hyper-geometric distribution ℋ

the overlapping probability a <dig> is then significantly greater than a <dig> if the probability pr{c <dig> ≤ c1|n <dig>  n <dig>  c+} is smaller than a given level α.

exact test in the general case
the previous test does not account for the composition of the sequences. the overlapping probabilities a <dig> and a <dig> can be expected to be different, according to some null model. in this case, the true overlapping probability in sequence i is bi = hi ai, where hi is an exceptionality coefficient . the problem is then to test h <dig> = {h <dig> = h2}. such a test is proposed in appendix: it involves the generalized negative hyper-geometric distribution.

asymptotic tests
as for the counts n and c, asymptotic tests such as likelihood ratio, chi-square or score tests can be derived to compare exceptionalities in terms of overlaps. these tests are not presented here to avoid further statistical developments but also because the small overlapping probabilities generally observed make them rarely relevant.

illustration
materials
comparing complete genomes of strains of single bacterial species allows to determine highly conserved regions  and numerous strain-specific dna segments  for each strain. these mosaic structures help to understand the evolution of bacterial genomes. indeed, the backbone probably corresponds to the common ancestral strain and is under vertical pressure whereas the loops may be associated with mobile elements or strain-specific pathogenicity. such backbone/loops segmentation has been systematically performed  <cit>  and store in the public mosaic database  <cit> . we have extracted from this database the e. coli k- <dig> specific loops  and the backbone  obtained from the pairwise alignment of the complete genomes of e. coli k- <dig> laboratory strain and the enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h <dig> strain. as an illustration, we have compared the exceptionalities of all the  <dig> octamers in the backbone versus in the loops. such comparison will point out octamers which do not have the same constraint, with respect to their frequency, on the loops versus on the backbone.

lrt versus binomial
we now compare the results provided by the two tests: binomial and lrt. because the former is one-sided and the latter is two-sided, we use a signed version lrts of the lrt statistic which is equal to lrt when n <dig> is greater than expected  and to – lrt otherwise . to make the graph more readable, we also transform the p-value pb into a gaussian score sb ∈ ℝ:

sb = Φ- <dig> 

where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard gaussian distribution. high positive values of sb correspond to motifs with an exceptionality coefficient in sequence  <dig> significantly higher than in sequence  <dig>  while high negative values of sb correspond to motifs having an exceptionality coefficient in sequence  <dig> significantly lower than in sequence  <dig> 

we see in figure  <dig> that the two statistics give very similar results for all the octamers in the backbone/loops comparison. table  <dig> gives the spearman and kendall correlation coefficients between the two statistics for different models. recall that spearman's coefficient is the correlation between the ranks, while kendall's one is the proportion of concordant pairs between the two rankings. this confirms that the lrt statistics is a reliable exceptionality comparison score, although the associated p-value is questionable for small counts.

note that the naive comparison between the two p-values simply associated with the exceptionality of each motif in each sequence does not provide the same sets of significant octamers . such p-values have been calculated using the poisson approximation of the number of clumps.

test for overlaps
very few motifs have significant differences in their clumps sizes. table  <dig> presents the results for the  <dig> motifs having a p-value smaller than 10%. for all of them, no overlap is observed in the backbone . the probability a is the overlapping probability under model m <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have proposed two complementary statistical tests to compare the exceptionalities of motif counts in two sequences. the binomial test is exact and particularly of interest for small counts . for large counts, we advise to use the likelihood ratio test which is asymptotic but strongly correlated with the exact binomial test. the lrt statistics is simple to calculate and can be directly interpreted as a contrast measure between the exceptionalities; its p-value can be derived from the chi-square distribution. both tests will be implemented in the r'mes software already devoted to exceptional motifs  <cit> .

the likelihood ratio test can be generalized to more than two sequences. suppose we want to compare i sequences s <dig>  s <dig> ..., si. in each of them, we assume that the count ni has a poisson distribution with parameter λi = ki ℓi μi and we want to test h <dig> = {k <dig> = k <dig> = ⋯ = ki} versus h <dig> = {at least one ki differs from the others}. the lrt statistics is

lrt=2∑iniln⁡.

under h <dig>  lrt has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with  degrees of freedom. the chi-square test can be generalized as well.

under the poisson model, both tests can be easily used for degenerated motifs or more generally for sets of motifs. let denote by w

we emphasize that these tests are valid only for independent sequences. they can not be used to detect skewed oligomers because the leading strand is not independent from the lagging strand  <cit> . this particular question requires the development of another rigorous statistical method; this is an ongoing work.

finally, note that the exceptionality comparison of word counts in sequences is actually equivalent to the differential analysis of sage expression data  <cit> . indeed, in the sage technology, the expression level of a given gene is measured by a number of associated tags and the problem is to compare the number of tags between two conditions. in such problem, no correction has to be done except for the total number of tags and our test statistics under model m <dig> are adapted.
