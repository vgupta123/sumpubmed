BACKGROUND
gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosidoses are progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases resulting mainly from the excessive accumulation of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides in the lysosomes, respectively  <cit> . these diseases are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and result in the premature death of affected individuals due to brain damage with progressive neurological signs. in gm <dig> gangliosidosis, the accumulation of gm <dig> ganglioside is caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal acid β-galactosidase  <cit> . in gm <dig> gangliosidosis, the accumulation of gm <dig> ganglioside is caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal acid β-hexosaminidase a or gm <dig> activator protein in gm <dig> gangliosidosis, and the disease is accordingly categorized into three variants: tay-sachs disease , sandhoff disease , and gm <dig> activator protein deficiency   <cit> .

gangliosidosis is more likely to occur in many animal species and breeds compared to other lysosomal diseases. naturally occurring gm <dig> gangliosidosis has been reported in dogs, including mixed beagles  <cit> , english springer spaniels  <cit> , portuguese water dogs  <cit> , alaskan huskies  <cit> , shiba inus  <cit> , and a mixed-breed dog  <cit> , and in cats, including siamese  <cit> , korat  <cit> , and several families of domestic cats . in addition, gm <dig> gangliosidosis has been reported in ruminants such as friesian calves  <cit> , suffolk sheep  <cit> , coopworth romny-cross sheep  <cit> , and romny sheep  <cit> , and in wild species such as american black bears  <cit>  and emus  <cit> . naturally occurring gm <dig> gangliosidosis has been reported in dogs, including german shorthair pointers  <cit> , japanese spaniels   <cit> , a golden retriever  <cit> , toy poodles  <cit> , and mixed-breed dogs  <cit> , and in cats, including korat  <cit> , european burmese  <cit> , and several families of domestic cats . in addition, gm <dig> gangliosidosis has been reported in yorkshire pigs  <cit> , jacob sheep  <cit> , a rabbit  <cit> , muntjak deer  <cit> , and american flamingos  <cit> .

the diagnosis of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosidoses is carried out based on comprehensive findings, which include clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and genetic findings using various types of specimens  <cit> . the clinical findings are progressive neurological, motor, and visual dysfunctions, but they are not specific to these diseases  <cit> . the biochemical findings include the cerebral accumulation of specific glycoconjugates and deficiency of specific enzyme activities, which are determined by specialized techniques such as thin-layer chromatography  and fluorometric enzymatic assays, respectively, using fresh or frozen tissues  <cit> . the histopathological and ultrastructural findings demonstrate swollen neurons filled with periodic acid-schiff stain-positive storage materials and osmiophilic membranous cytoplasmic bodies in the lysosomes of neurons, respectively, but these characteristics are not completely specific to these diseases  <cit> . genetic tests can be used to directly diagnose the diseases, but they are limited to diseases for which specific mutations have been identified . therefore, it is possible that a correct diagnosis has not been established in many animal cases, as a result of the partial absence or lack of specimens for biochemical, histological, ultrastructural, or genetic examination.

the aim of the present study was to establish immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques for the auxiliary diagnosis of canine and feline gangliosidoses using paraffin-embedded brain specimens, which are often stored for a long time in veterinary diagnostic laboratories worldwide.

methods
specimens
stored paraffin-embedded cerebral cortex samples of dogs and cats with gm <dig> or gm <dig> gangliosidosis were used in this study. these cases occurred in different parts of japan and the original diagnosis was made using specific genetic tests and biochemical analyses at the laboratory of clinical pathology, joint faculty of veterinary medicine, kagoshima university, which has been exclusively supporting the diagnosis of inherited metabolic diseases in animals in japan. these animals included a 14-month-old shiba inu with gm <dig> gangliosidosis diagnosed in  <dig>  an 11-month-old domestic shorthair cat with gm <dig> gangliosidosis diagnosed in  <dig>  a 20-month-old toy poodle with gm <dig> gangliosidosis diagnosed in  <dig>  and a 20-month-old domestic shorthair cat with gm <dig> gangliosidosis diagnosed in  <dig>  the diagnosis of these animals was established using genetic and/or biochemical tests reported previously . stored paraffin-embedded cerebral cortex samples of a dog and a cat without any brain disease were also used as controls. thin sections at  <dig> μm were prepared from these paraffin-embedded tissue blocks by standard method. these sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin  and subjected to the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques described below. all experimental procedures and ethical issues involving animals and their samples were approved by the the animal research committee at kagoshima university with the approval number vm <dig> 

immunohistochemical study
each section was deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. antigen retrieval was conducted by heating the sample in a  <dig> mm citrate buffer  in a microwave oven. thereafter, the samples were washed in deionized water, treated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide, and washed in  <dig>  m phosphate-buffered saline . blocking was performed with  <dig>  % casein in  <dig>  m pbs and incubated overnight at 4°c with the respective reagents.

for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside, biotinylated cholera toxin b subunit  was used. for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside, mouse anti-gm <dig> ganglioside monoclonal igm antibody  was used as a primary antibody, and biotinylated goat anti-mouse igm antibody  was used as a secondary antibody. subsequently, these sections were incubated with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin . the immunoreactivity was detected by a  <dig> ′-diaminobenzidine  system using dab tablet  as a peroxidase substrate. the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

immunofluorescent study
each section was pretreated in the same way as described above for immunohistochemistry. for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside, biotinylated cholera toxin b subunit  and alexa fluor 488-conjugated streptavidin  were used. for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside, mouse anti-gm <dig> monoclonal igm antibody  was used as a primary antibody, and alexa fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse igm antibody  was used as a secondary antibody. subsequently, these sections were incubated with a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride  solution  for nuclear staining. the fluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscopy .

RESULTS
using the he stain, cytoplasmic accumulation of pale to eosinophilic granular materials in balloon-swollen neurons was observed in the cerebral cortex samples of dogs and cats previously diagnosed with gm <dig> or gm <dig> gangliosidosis , whereas there was no such abnormal change observed in the samples of the control animals .fig.  <dig> histopathological findings in animals affected and unaffected with gangliosidoses. hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of the cerebral cortex from the following animals: a dog  and a cat  affected with gm <dig> gangliosidosis; a dog  and a cat  affected with gm <dig> gangliosidosis; an unaffected control dog  and cat . bar =  <dig> μm



using the immunohistochemical technique for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside, the accumulated cytoplasmic materials were positively stained and mainly identified as gm <dig> ganglioside in cells of animals with confirmed gm <dig> gangliosidosis . in animals with gm <dig> gangliosidosis, the accumulated cytoplasmic materials were very weakly positively stained in a portion of the cells of the affected cat . in the control animals, the cytoplasm in some normal-shaped cells was also positively stained to indicate the presence of gm <dig> ganglioside . the nuclei of several cells were positively stained in a portion of the samples such as in the case of feline gm <dig> gangliosidosis and in both control animals .fig.  <dig> immunohistochemical findings for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside in animals affected and unaffected with gangliosidoses. the immunohistochemical technique for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of the cerebral cortex from the following animals: a dog  and a cat  affected with gm <dig> gangliosidosis; a dog  and a cat  affected with gm <dig> gangliosidosis; an unaffected control dog  and cat . for the detection of gm <dig> ganglioside, biotinylated cholera toxin b subunit and peroxidase-labeled streptavidin were used. the immunoreactivity was detected by  <dig> ′-diaminobenzidine as a peroxidase substrate. the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. bar =  <dig> μm

discussion
gangliosides are glycosphingolipids consisting of a hydrophobic ceramide  and a hydrophilic oligosaccharide chain bearing one or more n-acetylneuraminic acid  residues, and are typical components of the outer leaflet of the plasma membranes of animal cells  <cit> . gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides are present as the main glycolipids in neurons and are likely to be involved in cell differentiation and cell–cell interactions, but their specific physiological functions remain obscure. therefore, developing techniques for the detection of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides is important not only for advancement in brain science but also for the correct diagnosis of gangliosidoses, because the intralysosomal accumulation of each ganglioside in neurons is characteristic to either gm <dig> or gm <dig> gangliosidosis. therefore, in the past few decades, various determination methods for the profiling, quantification, or evaluation of gangliosides, including gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides, in tissues, cultured cells, or extracellular fluids have been reported. these methods include tlc coupled with densitometric or immunochemical detection  <cit> , high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometric detection  <cit> , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  <cit> , and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  <cit> .

the in situ detection of gangliosides in tissue sections is also very important not only for diagnosis of the diseases but also to obtain reliable information on their tissue, cellular, and subcellular distributions  <cit> . furthermore, confirming that the histological detection of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides is applicable to paraffin-embedded specimens stored for a long period would also be useful for the retrospective diagnosis of the diseases, but very few studies have evaluated such in situ detection methods using long-term stored paraffin-embedded specimens from canine and feline gangliosidoses. in the present study, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques for the detection of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides were developed, and their application was evaluated using canine and feline paraffin-embedded specimens stored for  <dig> to  <dig> years. as a result, these two techniques could clearly detect the presence of both gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides in neurons of the control animals  as well as the accumulation of either gm <dig> or gm <dig> ganglioside in neurons of animals with diagnosed gm <dig>  and gm <dig> gangliosidoses . these data demonstrate that the two techniques are applicable to the retrospective in situ detection of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides, and consequently to the auxiliary diagnosis of gangliosidoses in dogs and cats. however, gangliosides can be accumulated as the secondary products without direct link to the primary protein defect in some lysosomal and a few non-lysosomal diseases  <cit> . therefore, in cases in which the abnormal accumulation of each ganglioside is found in swollen neurons, a definitive diagnosis should ultimately be made using dna extracted from the same paraffin-embedded specimen via the identification of pathogenic mutation in the responsible genes: the glb <dig> gene for gm <dig> gangliosidosis and the hexa, hexb, and gm2a genes for gm <dig> gangliosidosis.

comparing the two techniques developed in the present study, the immunofluorescent technique provided relatively less histopathological information than the immunohistochemical technique, due to the dark background when using immunofluorescence. therefore, the tissue, cellular, and subcellular distributions of stained materials could not be easily determined in the immunofluorescent technique; however, this technique does have the advantage of requiring a lower amount of reagents  because of its higher detection sensitivity compared to the immunohistochemical technique.

in addition, in the experiments conducted to detect gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides, the nuclei were stained in some specimens using both techniques. the positive staining of the nuclei in some cells from affected and control animals may result from the natural components of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides because the nuclei of neuronal cells in rat brain contain these gangliosides  <cit> . however, this stain of the nucleus was easily differentiated from the specific stain of cytoplasmic gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides when using the immunohistochemical technique but not when using the immunofluorescent technique, owing to the reduced morphological visibility. therefore, the simultaneous observation of he-stained cerebral tissues  is necessary for accurate judgment of the results, especially when using an immunofluorescent technique.

CONCLUSIONS
the immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques for the detection of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosides established in this study are useful for the auxiliary diagnosis of gm <dig> and gm <dig> gangliosidoses in dogs and cats before a definitive diagnosis can be made using molecular analysis for identification of causative mutations. these techniques may also be useful for the retrospective diagnosis of suspected cases of all animal species for which paraffin-embedded cerebral tissues are stored.
