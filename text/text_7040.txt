BACKGROUND
brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for a worldwide zoonosis  <cit> . like other intracellular bacteria such as legionella spp <cit>  and salmonella spp <cit> , b. abortus probably depends on precisely orchestrated interactions with host cell proteins for its infectious process. remarkably, these intracellular pathogens secrete proteins regulating host small gtpases  <cit> . small gtpases of the ras super family are signaling proteins that cycle between a gdp-bound inactive state and a gtp-bound active state. these two states are regulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which facilitate the conversion of gdp to gtp; gtpase activating proteins, which facilitate the hydrolysis of the gtp and guanine-nucleotide-dissociation inhibitors, which negatively regulate the exchange activity of the gtpase and dislocate them from membranes. rab gtpases are small gtpases playing a critical role in the control of membrane trafficking. specifically, rab <dig> has been shown to control membrane trafficking between the golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , rab <dig> was also putatively associated with the phagosome  <cit>  but without any known function in phagosomal maturation in mammalian cells  <cit> . rica is an effector recently identified in b. abortus, which interacts with human rab <dig>  <cit> . this interaction was detected using yeast 2-hybrid  and confirmed by gst-pulldown. rica has a preference for gdp-bound gst-rab <dig> compared to gtpγs-bound gst-rab <dig>  <cit> . active rab <dig> is known to be required for b. abortus intracellular proliferation  <cit> . a b. abortus Δrica strain recruits less rab <dig> on the brucella containing vacuole, suggesting that rica is playing a role during the intracellular trafficking of the bacterium  <cit> .

rica is predicted to belong to the superfamily of lβh proteins, comprising acetyltransferases, acyltransferases, carbonic anhydrases, ferripyochelin binding proteins, as well as many proteins of unknown functions. their structure is characterized by the assembly of three β sheets in a left-handed “β helix” structure. in this paper, we attempted to localize the rab <dig> interaction surface on the rica predicted structure. we performed the “absence of interference” approach  <cit>  previously used to map the interface of the catalytic domain of the dna methylase dnmt3a and its regulatory factor dnmt3l. mapping of the substitutions that do not disrupt the rica-rab <dig> interaction, on the predicted model of rica structure, revealed two possible interfaces, a beta sheet and a loop called igfp. the data reported here suggested that, of these two structural elements, at least the igfp loop is also involved in rica folding.

RESULTS
prediction of rica three-dimensional structure
a his <dig> tagged version of rica  was overproduced, purified to homogeinity and tested in several crystallization protocols that failed . we therefore modelized the rica structure by homology and verified for model correctness using esypred3d  <cit>  and verify3d  <cit>  programs respectively. the three-dimensional  structure of bacillus cereus bc <dig> sequence  was used as the template for the homology modeling. the function of this b. cereus protein is unknown. modeling using other templates  generated very similar models . conserved domain analysis of amino acid sequences of rica and 1xhd revealed tandemly-repeating hexapeptide repeats , indicating that the overall conformation of rica contains a left-handed β-helical component  characteristic of acetyltransferases superfamily  <cit> . the rica monomers were assembled as trimers. indeed several homologs are trimeric, and the three histidine residues involved in zinc binding between the monomers, in the structure of carbonic anhydrase from methanosarcina thermophila , are conserved in rica , suggesting that the trimeric structure is conserved in rica. the predicted structure of rica is presented in figure  <dig>  

rica mutagenesis and selection of alleles allowing interaction with rab2
rica specifically interacted with rab <dig> in the y2h system as indicated by the induction of the his <dig>  and the lacz  reporter genes . in this interaction assay, rica was fused with the transactivation coding sequence  of gal4p. since fusion of rica with the dna binding domain  of gal4p was autoactivating the his <dig> and lacz reporters, the simple selection of ‘edgetic’  alleles  <cit>  was not possible. we therefore decided to use the previously proposed “absence of interference” approach  <cit> , in which a possible interface is mapped on a three-dimensional  structure thanks to the absence of interaction-disruptive substitutions in this region of the protein. mutated rica  was synthesized by error-prone polymerase chain reaction   <cit>  from the pdest-ad-rica expression clone. a mutant library of about  <dig>  clones was prepared in e. coli, by bp recombinational cloning of the pcr products in the pdonr <dig> vector. five independent clones randomly selected were sequenced to check the mutation load. we found  <dig> mutations for the  <dig> sequenced bases, i.e. a mutation frequency of  <dig> %. the mutant library was transferred to the pdest-ad vector and assayed with rab <dig> in the y2h to assess the influence of the mutations introduced into rica. among  <dig> yeast clones, only  <dig> were positive for lacz and his <dig> reporters, indicating that only approximately 3% were able to interact with wild-type rab <dig>  a screening made with a slightly higher mutation rate for rica coding sequence did not yield any positive interaction , suggesting that  <dig> % is close to the maximum mutation rate still allowing the recovery of interacting proteins, for this experimental setting. the rica coding sequence was amplified from the  <dig> interacting clones by pcr and sequenced. we observed that a selective pressure occurred as the mutational load of  <dig> % in the unselected library decreased to  <dig> % in the selected clones. among the  <dig> interacting clones, only two had the wild-type sequence, and all substitutions observed in other clones are reported in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> substitutions were collected. as expected, some mutations are found in several clones, consistent with the hypothesis of their generation at different stages of the mutagenic pcr. for example, clones  <dig> and  <dig> are very similar, with four common substitutions and one additional substitution in clone  <dig>  

clones  <dig> and  <dig> did not contain substitutions. clones  <dig> and  <dig> contained the same substitutions.'

rab <dig> interaction assay with rica homologs
since b. abortus rica is conserved in many other bacteria, we tested the interaction of rica homologs with human rab <dig>  using y2h. interestingly, by fusing caulobacter crescentus rica homolog to the ad of gal4p, we detected interaction with human rab <dig> in a y2h assay using the his <dig> and ura <dig> reporters. the c. crescentus rica homolog is sharing 52% identities with b. abortus rica, indicating that it has a similar fold but with many substitutions, strongly suggesting that only conserved residues contribute to the interaction between rica and rab <dig> 

structural analysis of the substitutions that do not impair rica-rab <dig> interaction
the substitutions that do not impair mutated rica binding to rab <dig> in the y2h assay were positioned on the rica 3d model. however, it is predictable that substitutions involving very similar residues, within the interface region, would not impair rica-rab <dig> interaction. the mapping of such substitutions could thus prevent the localization of the interface on the surface of rica. we therefore arbitrarily removed substitutions with a score > <dig> in the blosum <dig> score matrix, since a substitution reversing charge  has a score of  <dig> in this matrix. the remaining “low scoring”  substitutions were positioned on the surface of the rica 3d model . the same procedure was applied to substitutions occurring between b. abortus rica and the c. crescentus rica homolog, that were also positioned on the model . the ls substitutions are less frequent in the regions predicted to be at the interface between monomers within the trimeric structure . when all such ls substitutions are indicated on the trimeric rica model, almost all the surface of the model is covered by substitutions, except for two regions . the first is the most exposed β-sheet in the rica trimeric structure . this region is probably conserved because it is involved in the folding of the β-helical component of the structure. substitutions in this region are thus suspected to interfere with folding of the protein, which is consistent with the absence of mutations in this region in clones that still allow interaction with rab <dig>  since unfolded proteins are very likely unable to interact with rab <dig> in the y2h assay. the second region, smaller than the first, is the igfp loop . it is a loop of the β-helical component of the structure. since it was conceivable that mutagenesis of this loop could generate loss of interaction without affecting folding, we generated a collection of mutants in this loop.

mutagenesis of the igfp loop
the igfp loop is part of a sequence of  <dig> amino acids in length flanked on each side by a β strand of the lβh . the sequence of four amino acids ile-gly-phe-pro  is exposed to the surface of rica in the 3d model of the trimer . loop regions of the lβh-containing proteins are known to contribute most of the residues that interact with binding partners  <cit>  and surface hydrophobicity has been used to identify regions of a protein surface most likely to interact with a binding ligand  <cit> . we therefore proposed that this exposed igfp loop could be involved in the recognition of rab <dig> 

since the gly and pro residues could adopt particular ϕ and ψ torsion angles and thus their substitution may affect folding of neighboring regions, mutagenesis was limited to the ile- <dig> and phe- <dig> residues that were replaced with random amino acids . the basic procedure is described in the materials and methods section. a library of xgxp mutants  was constructed, fused to ad domain of gal4p and assayed for interaction with db-rab <dig> using y2h. we observed that xgxp mutagenesis resulted in loss of interaction in about 80% of the clones . we sequenced alleles generating or not interaction between rica and rab <dig>  and the sequence of the xgxp loop is given in table  <dig>  it is detectable that the amino acid  composition at the first position  is more variable in the rica mutants that still interact with rab <dig>  compared to the second position . analysis of the mutated sequences shows that slight variations at both positions, e.g. in clones  <dig> and  <dig> , where ile to leu substitution occurs at position  <dig>  and phe to trp and his at position  <dig> respectively, disrupt interaction with rab <dig> in the y2h assay.

the * indicates a stop codon. his- and his+ refer to the phenotype generated by the his <dig> reporter, and lacz- and lacz+ to the phenotype generated by the lacz reporter.

in order to test a possible alteration of rica-rab <dig> interaction using gst pulldown, we attempted to overproduce xgxp clones n° <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as his6-rica fusions. among the  <dig> clones tested, none were found in the soluble extract and all were detected in the insoluble pellet, while the wild type control was found exclusively in the soluble fraction. this observation strongly suggests that mutations in the igfp loop contribute to the proper folding of his6-rica, at least in e. coli.

discussion
the objective of this study was to experimentally identify and characterize protein-protein interaction site of rica for rab <dig>  to provide a better understanding of the structural basis of a human small gtpase recognition by a bacterial effector protein. in the 3d model of rica, the protein may be divided in two parts: a n-terminal lβh component and a c-terminal α helix. within the lβh, there are three β sheets, two embedded in the trimeric structure and one exposed to the exterior. the two internal β sheets are predicted to form the interfaces between monomers and are rarely substituted  in mutants generated and still able to interact with rab <dig>  or in the c. crescentus homolog. however, the loops involved in the formation of the central pore of the rica model  are often mutated. the residues of the c-terminal α helix in contact with the lβh component are rarely mutated, while many exposed residues of this α helix are substituted in the mutated rica or in the c. crescentus homolog. these data are consistent with the proposed 3d model of rica.

our data suggest that mutations in the igfp loop that impair interaction with rab <dig> also generate a folding problem. this is rather surprising because the igfp loop is not very well conserved , and moreover it is exposed to the surface of the homologous proteins of known structure . the role of the igfp loop is unknown but it seems to be needed for the generation of a correct tertiary or quaternary structure, since the  <dig> xgxp mutants unable to interact with rab <dig> are found to be insoluble when expressed in e. coli, while the wild type rica is soluble. this data indicates that regions necessary for folding could overlap the regions necessary for interaction between rica and rab <dig>  unless the ls substitutions do not affect interaction between rica and rab <dig>  indeed, we cannot exclude that the rica-rab <dig> interaction is sufficiently stable to be resistant to point mutations, which would preclude most of the strategies targeting loss-of-interaction mutants.

to our knowledge, the identification of “edgetics” alleles  is the easiest way to identify interaction surfaces on the structure of the proteins involved in a given interaction  <cit> . however, this method is only applicable if the protein to be mapped is not an autoactivator in the y2h assay. our example of the igfp loop suggests that in some instances, regions necessary for folding could overlap regions involved in the protein-protein interaction . such a situation could lower the probability to get “edgetics” alleles. also, the “absence of interference” approach will generate a similar situation since the negative image produced by the absence of substitutions in a given region of the structure could simply reflect the absence of substitutions that do not affect folding of the protein. 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we predict that for a fraction of mono-domain proteins, including b. abortus rica, some structural element like the igfp loop could be bifunctional, involved in both protein folding and protein-protein interaction, as depicted in figure  <dig>
