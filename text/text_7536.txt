BACKGROUND
for herbivorous animals, food ingestion can have deleterious consequences  <cit> . at every meal, herbivores confront potential toxins in the form of plant secondary compounds . some herbivores, e.g., the black swallowtail  and stephen’s woodrat , have evolved the ability to specialize on plant species with high concentrations of pscs, whereas other herbivores must consume undefended plants or small quantities of many species of plants with differing pscs to keep toxin intake below threshold doses  <cit> .

in general, diet selection and diet breadth of herbivores is thought to be governed by the capacity of biotransformation  enzymes in the liver  <cit> . major evolutionary dietary shifts seem to be enabled by an underlying change in biotransformation enzymes  <cit> . surprisingly few alterations among myriad biotransformation enzymes are required for a change in the capacity to metabolize a new toxin. insect resistance to pesticides and mammalian resistance to rodenticides can occur through the increased activity of a single biotransformation enzyme  <cit> . currently, far more is known about the biotransformation mechanisms employed by insect herbivores in a diet shift than their mammalian counterparts  <cit> .

the vast diversity of biotransformation enzymes presents a challenge in determining which enzymes enable the processing of a particular diet or toxin. for example, more than  <dig> hepatic biotransformation enzymes have been described for the laboratory rat, rattus norvegicus . enzyme activity assays exist for far fewer than the known number of biotransformation enzymes and are not always specific to a gene product  <cit> . to overcome these challenges, we took a genomic approach and used microarray technology customized for our study species, to identify, on a more global scale, biotransformation gene expression patterns involved in the processing of pscs. gene expression is an important phenotypic character, subject to selection from the environment  <cit> . many recent studies have concluded that differences in gene expression among groups are the result of disparate selective forces  <cit> .

we investigated the independent evolution of biotransformation mechanisms related to diet switching by capitalizing on a dramatic diet change event that occurred in the recent evolutionary history two species of woodrats . both species underwent radical dietary changes due to floral shifts during the climate change event of the late pleistocene and early holocene . this event resulted in both of these woodrats independently switching from diets of juniper and/or cactus, to one containing creosote bush as it naturally invaded from mexico and expanded to become the dominant shrub in the major deserts of the u.s. southwest  <cit> . fossil records of middens of both species indicate that n. bryanti came into contact with creosote  <dig>  years before n. lepida <cit> .

the change in diet to creosote from previous plant species represents a marked change in psc composition. juniper contains high concentrations of numerous terpenes as well as less abundant tannins  <cit> . the primary psc in cactus  is only degraded by gut microbes, not liver enzymes  <cit> . in contrast, creosote leaves produce a complex resin containing > <dig> compounds, primarily aromatic ones, which account for 10-25% of the leaf dry weight  <cit> . the principal component of resin is nordihydroguaiaretic acid , a phenolic lignan with detrimental effects when administered to laboratory rats in doses regularly consumed by woodrats  <cit> . the distinct differences in the pscs of juniper and cactus versus creosote suggest they are metabolized by different biotransformation pathways  <cit> . comparative data on enzyme activities and gene expression of populations of n. lepida support this contention. neotoma lepida that feed on juniper have different enzyme activity and gene expression profiles compared to those that feed on creosote even when they are fed the same diet  <cit> . indeed, populations of n. lepida in the mojave desert have adapted to a diet of creosote as evidenced by their ability to ingest greater quantities of creosote compared to those from the great basin desert that feed on juniper and have no prior exposure to creosote  <cit> . less is known about the ancestral diet of n. bryanti and no data exist with respect to its ability to metabolize pscs. however, a recent comparative study on gene expression in n. lepida and n. bryanti on a non-toxic diet revealed similarities in expression profiles in populations of both species that feed on creosote, relative to n. bryanti populations naïve to creosote  <cit> . these results are consistent with potential convergence in biotransformation strategies of n. lepida and n. bryanti with respect to metabolism of a creosote diet.

to advance our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in diet switching in mammals as well as biotransformation of pscs in general, we addressed three questions. we asked which genes are induced  by woodrats in response to the addition of creosote pscs to the diet. gene induction is a conventional pharmacological approach used to identify potentially important enzymes in biotransformation of foreign compounds. second, we asked whether experience mattered with respect to the biotransformation of creosote. we contrasted the responses of woodrats that historically and currently consume creosote to a population that is ecologically and evolutionarily naïve to creosote compounds. lastly, we asked whether there was convergence in the pathways used for biotransformation of creosote resin between n. bryanti and n. lepida that regularly fed on creosote bush by comparing the induced transcripts and also by contrasting their gene expression profiles.

RESULTS
feeding trial
all three populations maintained weight on both the control and creosote diet . however, there was a significant difference across populations with the experienced n. bryanti being heavier than the other two populations.

microarray quality control
four of the  <dig> arrays failed to pass all  <dig> of agilent’s quality metrics. three of these passed  <dig> of  <dig> metrics, and  <dig> passed  <dig> of  <dig>  all were kept in the analysis. on average, less than  <dig> % of the features across all arrays were flagged as non-uniform. the clustergram grouping individual woodrats by overall expression profile  grouped all the n. lepida in one monophyletic clade and each n. bryanti population in its own monophyletic clade, but did not group individuals by diet within species designations .

transcripts induced by creosote
both species and all populations altered gene expression in response to the creosote diet compared to the control. the experienced n. bryanti had fewer induced  and repressed transcripts  than either the experienced n. lepida  or the naïve n. bryanti ; however, the difference among the groups was not significant . there were no induced transcripts shared by all groups in this analysis. the experienced and naïve populations of n. bryanti shared two induced transcripts, one of which was for a biotransformation gene . none of the treatment groups on creosote induced more than five different biotransformation genes . the largest fold induction of a biotransformation transcript was observed in the naïve n. bryanti, which induced sulfotransferase 3a <dig> by 22×. all other biotransformation transcripts across all groups exhibited inductions of 7-fold or less.

differential expression between naïve and experienced woodrats
there were significant differences in expression related to experience with creosote between n. bryanti populations. although the total number of transcripts with greater expression in both the experienced and naïve was similar , the experienced population expressed absolutely twice as many transcripts for biotransformation enzymes . proportionally, 37% of all transcripts expressed to a greater degree by experienced n. bryanti were biotransformation related compared to only 18% of those in the naïve n. bryanti. many of the differentially regulated biotransformation transcripts coded for the same genbank accession. the effective gene numbers, calculated from shannon’s h, reflected the same pattern as the total biotransformation transcript counts. for naïve n. bryanti the effective gene number was  <dig>  compared to an effective gene number for experienced n. bryanti of  <dig> .

chi square analyses compare the number of detoxification genes with higher expression to the overall number of genes with higher expression across the two experimental groups.

the degree to which upregulated genes were expressed was greater, overall, in the experienced n. bryanti . the biotransformation transcript with the greatest expression in naïve n. bryanti and the only one with more than 10-fold higher expression in naïve compared to experienced animals, was a cytochrome p <dig> . in contrast, there were three biotransformation transcripts in the experienced n. bryanti that exceeded 10-fold higher expression compared to naïve n. bryanti. these transcripts are related to the functionalization of aldehydes  and glucuronic acid and glutathione conjugation pathways .

differential expression between experienced woodrats of two species
the experienced n. bryanti had increased expression of more transcripts than n. lepida  as well as a greater degree to which those genes were expressed . this result was also true with respect to the biotransformation transcripts alone; n. bryanti had greater expression of 3× more transcripts compared to n. lepida on creosote and, in general, these genes were expressed to a much higher degree . the effective gene numbers also reflect this pattern. the effective gene number with greater expression in n. bryanti was  <dig> , whereas the effective gene number for n. lepida was  <dig> .

discussion
despite the vast knowledge of drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans and model species, the biotransformation mechanisms used by mammalian herbivores to metabolize pscs are largely unknown. until recently, many studies were limited to analysis of one or a few biotransformation enzymes  <cit> . this study took advantage of microarray technology customized for a unique study system to address this deficit in our understanding. we investigated, on a transcriptomic scale, the genes induced by a particular suite of pscs  and evaluated whether a common set of genes were expressed by herbivores with varying levels of evolutionary experience with these pscs. we explored whether experienced herbivores have independently converged on regulation of a similar set of biotransformation genes. we found that biotransformation enzyme expression does indeed vary with ecological and evolutionary experience with creosote and that independent woodrat lineages employ, in part, similar strategies for successfully dealing with these shared pscs. in addition, the results narrow the field from hundreds of possible biotransformation genes to less than ten candidates. the work provides a testable framework for the changes in expression of biotransformation enzymes that may have occurred as woodrats shifted from one toxic diet to another.

induced biotransformation genes
we identified a narrow set of candidate genes relevant to the biotransformation of creosote. surprisingly few biotransformation transcripts were induced by any of the groups fed creosote resin compared to the control diet. of the hundreds of biotransformation enzymes, only four unique biotransformation transcripts were induced in the naïve n. bryanti, six in the experienced n. lepida, and in the experienced n. bryanti, only a single biotransformation enzyme, an aldo-keto reductase  was induced . all of these transcripts encode for enzymes that act on substrates similar to the compounds present in creosote, particularly aromatic compounds  <cit> . these enzymes could function in tandem as a pathway to produce the final metabolite excreted in urine and/or feces  <cit> . for example, epoxide hydrolase acts on aromatic compounds such as naphthalene epoxide whose parent compound, napthalene, is present in creosote  <cit> . akr enzymes, in turn, act on the metabolites produced by epoxide hydrolase, whereas glutathione s-transferases and udp glucuronosyltransferases add conjugates to the metabolites of akr  <cit> . thus, although few transcripts were induced in woodrats fed creosote, those induced transcripts produce enzymes that act on substrates similar to those in resin. furthermore, the candidate genes identified could function in concert with one another in the biotransformation of pscs in creosote.

few of the transcripts induced by the creosote diet were shared across woodrat groups. the conspecific populations shared induction of akr7a <dig>  the superfamily of akr enzymes act on a broad variety of substrates, particularly aldehydes and ketones, and the 7a <dig> isoform metabolizes aflatoxin b <dig>  <cit> . epoxide hydrolase was induced by the naïve n. bryanti and experienced n. lepida, and also the experienced n. bryanti but in this case, at less than the 2-fold cut-off. this enzyme adds water to epoxides that could otherwise cause toxicity or mutation  <cit> . epoxides are often formed during the biotransformation of aromatic hydrocarbons  <cit> , which are common in creosote resin  <cit> . the shared induction across all three groups of woodrats suggests epoxide hydrolase could be critical to the biotransformation of resin. lastly, the naïve n. bryanti and experienced n. lepida induced different sulfotransferases. this superfamily has high affinity to myriad substrates and metabolizes compounds  present in creosote resin  <cit> . sulfotransferases biotransform xenobiotics by the addition of a sulfur co-factor, generated from dietary cysteine. because the availability of cysteine is often limited, sulfation capacity is often much lower than other conjugation pathways. it is possible that the woodrat diet contains ample cysteine or its precursors, serine and methionine. consistent with this idea, both experienced populations upregulated methyltransferases involved in serine and methionine metabolism . alternatively, sulfation capacity may be greater in woodrats compared to other mammals. however, previous work suggests the capacity for sulfation is exceeded in both naïve and experienced n. lepida at low levels of creosote ingestion  <cit> . the role that sulfation plays in the biotransformation of creosote resin deserves further attention.

alterations in biotransformation mechanisms as a result of diet shifts
the change by woodrats from an ancestral diet of juniper and/or cactus to that of creosote likely required a different set of biotransformation enzymes to process the disparate suites of pscs in these plants. the naïve and experienced n. bryanti had increased expression of about the same number of genes on creosote compared to the control diet. however, within that pool of genes, the naïve n. bryanti expressed fewer transcripts with biotransformation functions than the experienced animals. a similar pattern has been observed elsewhere; woodrats feeding on a novel diet  expressed relatively few biotransformation transcripts and more transcripts related to cellular function compared to feeding on their native diet  <cit> . the animals on the novel diet were thought to be unable to marshal the appropriate biotransformation response, and the upregulation of genes with diverse cellular functions may have been to prevent or respond to the physiological consequences of the pscs. indeed, the functional analyses of the gene ontologies for differentially expressed genes in n. bryanti are consistent with this hypothesis . the transcriptomes of naïve woodrats were enriched in go classes related to considerable physiological stresses . in contrast, those enriched in experienced n. bryanti were related to the processing of toxins.

functional convergence
there is evidence for functional convergence between the two species with respect to the transcripts induced on a creosote diet. as discussed above, the transcript for epoxide hydrolase was the only biotransformation transcript significantly induced by both species; however, it was expressed at levels below the 2-fold cut-off used in the initial analysis. the top biotransformation transcript induced by n. lepida  and the only biotransformation transcript induced by n. bryanti  both encode for enzymes that metabolize similar substrates, particularly aldehydes. creosote resin contains at least  <dig> compounds, including aldehydes and compounds that may have aldehyde functional groups after biotransformation by other enzymes  <cit> . aldehydes are reactive compounds that cause considerable cellular damage. inadequacies in the biotransformation of aldehydes are connected to a number of human diseases  <cit> . given the potential for damage, aldehydes in creosote are likely a significant selective force resulting in the convergence on the induction of transcripts related to aldehyde metabolism by both species.

further demonstration that the two experienced woodrats exhibit a parallel response to the ingestion of creosote resin is witnessed in their overall gene expression patterns. many of the biotransformation transcripts that were more highly expressed in the experienced n. bryanti have analogous functions with those that were more highly expressed in n. lepida . for example, both species have higher expression of different isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenases . a similar pattern is present for alcohol dehydrogenases, cytochromes p <dig>  methyltransferases, glutathione s-transferases, and sulfotransferases. one notable exception to this pattern is that n. lepida did not have a corollary in the udp-glucuronosyltransferases , a superfamily of biotransformation enzymes responsible for glucuronidation. neotoma bryanti had higher expression of at least  <dig> different ugts, one of which was expressed  <dig> fold higher. the ugts are considered some of the most versatile of the conjugation enzymes due to their wide range of substrates  <cit> . previous studies reported that n. lepida fed creosote increased glucuronidation thereby demonstrating it is indeed an important pathway in n. lepida <cit> . it is possible that both species use the same ugts for creosote biotransformation but that n. bryanti utilizes this pathway to a greater extent resulting in the higher gene expression values observed in this study.

the last line of evidence for convergence stems from go results. the experienced populations fed creosote share three ontologies , which all relate to biotransformation .

constitutive differences
while many biotransformation enzymes are induced when an animal is exposed to xenobiotics, some are expressed constitutively at high levels  <cit> . it is difficult to identify such baseline differences in expression using microarrays. for example, a recent study on an herbivorous insect that specializes on glucosinolate-rich plants did not identify any induced biotransformation transcripts when the insects were fed glucosinolates compared to a control diet  <cit> . constitutive expression could explain this outcome. in our study, direct comparisons of gene expression between populations fed creosote provide insight into how animals differ in baseline biotransformation, especially when coupled with the results from the induction study. the experienced n. bryanti induce very few transcripts, only one of which has known biotransformation function, relative to both the naïve n. bryanti and the experienced n. lepida. however, direct comparisons of experienced n. bryanti with both the naïve conspecific and experienced congeneric when all are fed creosote, revealed many more differences in expression . overall, the experienced n. bryanti had greater expression of significantly more biotransformation enzymes. this pattern coupled with the paucity of induced transcripts suggests that the experienced n. bryanti may be constitutively expressing biotransformation enzymes at a higher level. it is possible that n. bryanti’s longer historic exposure to creosote caused an increase in baseline production of biotransformation enzymes such that they continually express the appropriate combination of enzymes to efficiently detoxify creosote pscs  <cit> . moreover, the experienced n. lepida go terms include many for regulation and signal transduction, suggesting processes in flux, whereas these terms are absent from the experienced n. bryanti results .

CONCLUSIONS
herbivores and the plants on which they feed represent one of the most common interactions in nature, yet we know relatively little about the mechanisms that herbivores, particularly mammalian ones, employ to overcome plant toxins  <cit> . the application of recently developed genome-based approaches is enabling researchers to more thoroughly investigate the responses of herbivores to plant defensive compounds. this work capitalized on the availability of a recently developed microarray to identify the genes induced by mammalian herbivores when feeding on pscs. the results lay the requisite groundwork for future functional and evolutionary studies of the genes involved in the metabolism of creosote toxins and the evolution of diet switching in woodrats.
