BACKGROUND
the long noncoding rna malat <dig> , also known as neat <dig>  or alpha, is a highly conserved and large-size nuclear noncoding rna  molecule. this gene was firstly identified in  <dig> from early-stage non-small cell lung cancer  cells with highly expression level  <cit> , subsequently a number of publications reported that malat <dig> is also as one of the major genes that highly up regulates in different cancers including endometrial cancer  <cit> , breast cancer  <cit> ; cervical cancer  <cit> ; colorectal cancer  <cit> ; hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> ; liver cancer  <cit> ; neuroblastoma  <cit> ; osteosarcoma  <cit> , pancreatic cancer  <cit> , prostate cancer  <cit> , bladder cancer  <cit> , and gastric cancer  <cit> . targeted deletion of malat <dig> in human lung tumor cells impairs tumor metastasis in a mouse xenograft model  <cit> . therefore, expression of malat <dig> correlates with tumor development, progression, metastasis and survival in different cancer types. in addition to the important role in proliferation and metastases of cancers, malat <dig> also involves in other diseases and even in normal physiological processes of cells, for example: it has been reported that knockdown of malat <dig> using sirna suppresses myoblast proliferation by arresting cell growth in the g/g phase  <cit> , thus target therapy of this gene shows a potential value for recovery of muscle atrophy or muscle wasting diseases. in addition, lin m.y., et al.  <cit>  reported that malat <dig> is highly expressed in ips . in normal tissues, malat <dig> expresses in a tissue specific patterns, for example, malat <dig> is the most abundantly expressed lincrna in differentiating neurons, and is up regulated in cerebellum, hippocampus and brain stem of human alcoholics  <cit> . when treated the mouse brain cells with pcp , malat <dig> is highly up regulated  <cit> .

full length malat <dig> localizes in nuclear speckles, which is a dynamic structure that is essential for gathering and recruiting splicing factors  <cit> , thus, malat <dig> rna was considered to be as an important regulatory molecule for trans splicing of rna  <cit> , lin m.y., et al.  <cit>  has found that there is a substantial difference in splices isoforms of lncrna including malat <dig> generated in induced pluripotent stem cells  and neurons, these isoforms are specific to different growth status, the physiological function is unknown. as a major lncrna, malat <dig> also joins regulation process of transcription splicing. malat <dig> interacts with serine/arginine splicing factors , results in modulating the distribution of splicing factors in nuclear speckle, and changing cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of sr proteins. researchers have already identified that malat <dig> rna has multiple physiological functions in normal cells, such as regulating cell cycle  <cit> , malat <dig> modulates the expressions of cell cycle genes, which are required for g1/s regulation and mitotic progression with tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific patterns.

in addition to associate with malignant phenotype for high expression of wild type of malat <dig> rna, the mutated forms of malat <dig> are also involved in malignant phenotype; for example, t   was been found in mesenchymal hamartoma of liver  <cit> , this translocation causes breakpoint in malat <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  thereafter produces mutated forms of malat1rna by fusing malat <dig> with mhlb <dig> gene of chromosome  <dig>  t   was reported in renal cell carcinoma  <cit> , this translocation causes malat <dig> -tfeb gene fusion, results in over expression of native tfeb protein , while native tfeb in cells without this translocation is not detectable by this assay.

it has been reported that lncrnas play critical role in normal differentiation/cell fate decision during hematopoiesis. the first lncrna with key role in hematopoiesis to be described was ego  <cit> , an evolutionary conserved gene, which transcribes an antisense rna of itpr <dig> gene that modulates the development of eosinophils, ego is normally expressed in human cd34+ hescs and becomes up regulated during their differentiation into eosinophil. knockdown of ego by sirnas in cultured cd34+ progenitors impairs the expression of those genes including major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, which are critical for eosinophil development. thus, ego can contribute to eosinophilopoiesis by enhancing the expression of genes needed for this process. lncrnas are also implicated in the regulation of myelopoiesis, granulocytosis and monocytosis, zhang et al.  <cit>  identified hotairm <dig>  a gene transcribes an antisense sequence of hoxa1/ <dig> intergenic region, is highly up regulated during retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation of myeloid progenitors. hotairm <dig> transcript is a ~500 bp rna fragment, which coordinates along with the activation of hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig> expression during granulocytic differentiation in nb <dig> cells   <cit> . the understanding regarding involvement of malat <dig> in hematopoiesis still remains poor. in this study we are addressed to explore malat <dig> expression regulation patterns and possible physiological functions in hematopoietic differentiation.

RESULTS
malat <dig> is an evolutionary conserved lncrna and expressed in a wide range of species and tissues of primates
on mouse chromosome  <dig>  malat <dig> gene is located at 40 kb down stream of neat <dig> gene . sequence analysis for mouse malat <dig> gene shows malat <dig> is  <dig>  kb transcript, which has been identified both by northern blot and sequence analysis of transcription. alignment analysis of multiple genomic sequences shows malat <dig> is the most evolutionary conserved sequence in ~120 kb chromosome region . the comparison of wide range of species  by phylogenetic analysis shows these malat <dig> molecules of different resources organisms are from a common ancestor . mouse malat <dig> has smallest sequence diversity with rat malat <dig>  and human malat <dig> is very closed to bonobo and chimpanzee malat <dig>  highly conserved coding dna sequence is common known with important physiological functions, but the role for many of these highly conserved long non-coding dna sequences remains unclear. the conservative of malat <dig> sequence indicates it is a house keeping like gene, more and more evidence shows it up regulates in many cancers, and this research also shows malat <dig> is highly expression in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells. in addition, several publications have described malat <dig> regulates the target gene expression via multiple layer and flexible manners  <cit> . therefore, we predict that malat <dig> plays a critical regulation role on maintenance of proliferation and malignant cell metastasis ability, more experiments need to be carried out to clarify these functions of malat <dig> molecule. through extensive analysis of publicly accessible panoramic expression databases including geo , geneatlas , sage genie , and nhprtr . we found malat <dig> rna is extensively expressed in different species and tissues of primates including human being. in order to compare the malat <dig> expression status in target tissues that we were worked on, we showed the expression abundances of malat <dig> rna in  <dig> target tissues from  <dig> primate species based on the datasets of illumina bodymap  <dig> for expression analysis of human malat <dig> and nhprtr for expression analysis of other primates malat <dig> . the malat <dig> expresses with high level in other vertebrates such as zebra fish has been reported recently  <cit> .fig.  <dig> malat <dig> gene localization, sequence conservation cross vertebrates and evolutionary pattern. a mouse malat <dig> locus is on chromosome  <dig> , and is localized on 40 kb down stream of neat <dig> gene, yields a  <dig>  kb of transcript. b sequence comparison indicates malat <dig> gene is the most conserved sequence in around 120 kb region of chromosome  <dig>  c phylogenetic analysis of evolution relationship of malat <dig> gene among  <dig> species of mammals, mouse malat <dig> has smallest genetic distance with rat malat <dig> and closes to human malat <dig> gene

fig.  <dig> malat <dig> expresses in a wide range of species and tissues of primates including human tissue samples. the expression datasets based on rnaseq were used to show the rna level of malat <dig> in different tissues of primates.  <dig> target tissues were selected as showed in the figure come from  <dig> different primate species. the malat <dig> expression dataset of human tissues are available in ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/research/acembly/av.cgi?db=human, and the expression datasets of other primates are available in the transcriptome database of nhprtr http://www.nhprtr.org/data/2014_nhp_tissuespecific. the relative expression level of malat <dig> rna was labeled as fpkm 



atra induces malat <dig> up regulation in eml cells
in order to induce eml cell differentiation, we treated the cells with 10 mm of atra for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h respectively, total rnas were detected by northern blot together with rna from epro cells. these rnas represent the different stages of hematopoietic differentiation, as showed in fig. 3a , a rna fragment with the size of ~7 kb was highly expressed in eml  and eml  and dramatically decreases in eml  and eml , tiny expression of this rna was detected in epro cells. the quantitative differences of malat <dig> expression level among these induction stages were determined by comparison of signal intensity after normalizing to β-actin control. from these comparisons, we conclude malat <dig> expression level in eml cells  is  <dig>  times higher than that in epro; and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> times higher than that in eml cells exposed to atra for  <dig>   <dig> and 6 h respectively .fig.  <dig> expression analysis of malat <dig> gene in hematopoietic cells. a northern blot showed the expression level of full length malat <dig> in atra induced eml cells and epro cells, upper panel: total rnas from different induction stages of eml cells as designated in the figure. lower panel: semi-quantitative analysis of relative expression level for malat <dig> gene in indicated eml and epro cells; b northern blot showed the expression level of full length malat <dig> in different populations of mouse bone marrow as indicated in the figure. upper panel: total rna from lrh+, lrh-/ and lrh-/ were detected with malat1probe. lower panel: semi-quantitative analysis of relative expression level for malat <dig> gene in these populations. c northern blot showed the expression level for malat <dig> gene in multiple tissues of mouse. upper panel: total rna from mouse tissues as showed in the figure was detected. lower panel: semi-quantitative analysis of relative expression level for malat <dig> gene in mouse tissues. 225 bp 5’ malat <dig> dna was used as the probe to detect the malat <dig> expression, a ~ <dig>  kb malat <dig> rna was labeled in the figures, the data was been normalized using β-actin, for further details see material and methods



malat <dig> expresses at high level in early stage of primitive progenitor cells in bone marrow and higher level in liver than in most of other tissues
malat <dig> down regulates during hematopoietic differentiation induced by atra, if this expression behavior also existed in normal hematopoietic differentiation? we isolated linage negative populations  of mouse bone marrow by using the lin + antibodies cocktails, the lin-populations was further isolated by using fluorescence dye rhodamine- <dig> and hoechst- <dig> as described in material and methods. our northern analysis shows malat <dig> expresses with much higher level in more primitive progenitor cells , the expression level in lrh population is  <dig> fold higher than in lrb and  <dig> fold higher than in lin + population . analysis of multiple tissues shows malat <dig> expresses with the highest level in liver, and no detectable expression in skeletal muscle, among tissues assayed in this experiment, the expression level of malat <dig> from high to low lists as following: liver > kidney > lung > heart > testis > spleen > brain > skeletal muscle .

hematopoietic differentiation induced by atra causes up regulation of p <dig> and inhibition of eml cell growth
atra treated eml cells induces hematopoietic differentiation  <cit> . we tested the hematopoietic factor gata <dig>  which is a critical transcription factor for primitive hematopoiesis procedure  <cit> . our data shows that atra exposed significantly up regulates gata <dig> expression in eml cells  . since it has been identified that gata <dig> is one of the indicator of hematopoiesis of yolk sac stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells, therefore atra exposed initiates hematopoiesis of eml cells. we were also further tested the expression behavior of eklf <dig> , which drives red blood cell differentiation and represses megakaryocyte formation  <cit> . the results show eklf <dig> is up regulated to around  <dig>  times of uninduced eml cells , that implicates the direction of differentiation is more towards blood cells than megakaryocytes. analysis for growth rate of atra-induced eml cells shows an inhibition effect as showed in fig. 4b, the proliferation rate of eml cells is decreased around 50 % after 48-h treatment with atra .fig.  <dig> the analysis of gene expression and cell proliferation. a eml cell were induced with atra for indicated time points. the expression of p <dig>  malat <dig>  gata <dig> and eklf <dig> were detected using qrt-pcr, β-actin was used as a loading control, and the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown. significant changes were detected from the group of 48 h induction . b eml cells were treated with or without  atra for indicated time points, the graph showed the rate of growth plotted on a liner scale, the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown, p <  <dig>  vs mock control



over expression of p <dig> down regulates malat <dig> expression level via transcriptional inhibition
in order to test if the p <dig> level in cells affects malat <dig> expression, we carried out a transiently transfection experiment that enforced expression of p <dig> gene in eml cells for 48 h, and then prepared total rna for qrt-pcr detection. our data shows p <dig> expression significantly decreases malat <dig> expression level. in this test, when p <dig> increased to  <dig>  times of control, malat <dig> decreased around  <dig> times . based on this observation, we further test if p <dig> can affect the transcription activity by performing chip experiment using above transfected eml cells, the result shows there was less target sequence can be enriched on malat <dig> promoter region by anti-pol ii antibody  in p <dig> over expressed eml cells . we then predicted the p <dig> binding sites on promoter region of malat <dig> using “promo” program , two typical p <dig> binding domains have been predicated that the region of  named as p53-bs- <dig> locus, the region of  named as p53-bs- <dig> locus . we picked up these two sites for chip assay experiments by using anti-p <dig> antibody. around  <dig> fold of target sequence was enriched on p53-bs- <dig> locus , but no significant enrichment on bs-p53- <dig> locus.fig.  <dig> p <dig> bound to malat <dig> promoter and inhibited its expression. a over expression of p <dig> protein  in eml cells down regulated malat <dig> level with around  <dig> times, β-actin was used as a loading control, the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown, p <  <dig>  . b chip assay to detect the cells with over expression of p <dig> gene. rabbit igg was used as the negative control of chip, the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown, p <  <dig>  vs mock control . c schematic drawing shows rna polymerase ii initiation complex binds to malat <dig> promoter region, and p <dig> protein inhibits dna binding activity of pol ii therefore interferes the initiation complex assembly on transcription start site as indicated in the figure

fig.  <dig> p <dig> regulated the expression of malat <dig> via sequence specific binding. a chip assay showed p <dig> protein bound to bs-p53- <dig> but bs-p53- <dig> site, the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown, p <  <dig>  vs mock control . b schematic drawing shows the sequence specific binding of repression. the bs-p53- <dig> site with conserved sequence of cggcatg has strong p <dig> binding activity therefore inhibits malat <dig> expression



discussion
malat <dig> may preserve the proliferation ability of hematopoietic stem cells
as a typical tumor marker, malat <dig> expresses with high level in malignant cells. in this study we found malat <dig> gene expresses with high level in undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells and primitive progenitor cells, down regulation of malat <dig> accompanies with growth inhibition of eml cells. our experiments have proved that p <dig> is acted as a transcription repressor of malat <dig> expression to inhibit malat <dig> activation. it has been identified that interferes p <dig> expression inhibits hematopoietic and muscle differentiation  <cit> , reverse function of malat <dig> vs. p <dig> implies malat <dig> preserves the ability to enhance the proliferation and inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic and muscle cells. increased p <dig> expression causes cell differentiation has been recently suggested by some observations . in addition, interferes with endogenous wt-p <dig> protein of non transformed murine cells 32d  and c2c <dig>  using dominant negative p <dig> protein also shows a dramatic inhibition effect of terminal differentiation into granulocytes or myotubes respectively  <cit> . in this study, we identified that the proliferation ability of hematopoietic cells is significantly inhibited by interfering malat <dig> expression in eml cells . taken together, interfering endogenous malat <dig> expression directly inhibits cell differentiation, and that malat <dig> acts in opposite direction with p <dig> in eml cells preserves the proliferation ability of hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors.fig.  <dig> interfered malat <dig> expression didn’t significantly change the hematopoietic differentiation but inhibited the proliferation of eml cells. a inhibited malat <dig> expression of eml cells by rna interference, the decrease of malat <dig> didn’t significantly change the expression of hematopoietic factor gata <dig> and eklf <dig>  the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown, p <  <dig>  vs mock control . b eml cells were interfered with control rnai oligo or malat <dig> rnai oligo, cell number was counted at  <dig> and 48 h, the graph showed the growth rate of eml cells plotted on a liner scale, the means ± sd of three independent experiments are shown, p <  <dig>  vs mock control . c schematic drawing shows a work model that atra induces hematopoietic differentiation and malat <dig> down regulation. in this model, atra induces up regulation of gata <dig>  eklf <dig> and tumor repressor p <dig>  and therefore causes hematopoietic differentiation, on the other hand, p <dig> acts as a transcription factor inhibits malat <dig> expression in eml cells, malat <dig> played a role in maintaining proliferation potential of hematopoietic cells



p <dig> protein down regulates malat <dig> expression via sequence specific binding
atra induces hematopoietic differentiation of eml cells is determined by up regulation of gata <dig> and eklf <dig> level. our study has proved this differentiation accompanies with up regulation of p <dig> and down regulation of malat <dig>  surprisingly, p <dig> protein binds to malat <dig> core promoter region, and chip data shows p <dig> can be enriched in the region of , the core binding loci is in the range of− <dig> to−698 bp, in which has the sequence of cggcatggccgccaaggtcgccgtgccct. another predicted loci is in the range of , the core binding loci is in the range of , in which has the sequence of catggccttgctgggctgagaccgcagcct, however, chip result shows the second site doesn’t effectively bind with p <dig> . therefore we speculate even both sites  have conserved catg sequence domain, but only p53-bs <dig> binds to p <dig> protein and inhibited malat <dig> gene activation, hence the background sequence of p53-bs <dig> with conserved domain catg may favor a configuration of p <dig> binding. our finding is consistent with some expression study of p <dig>  for example, viral protein dysregulated p <dig> expression leads to up regulation of malat <dig>  and mutation or inactivation of p <dig> is also shown up regulation of malat <dig> expression  <cit> . therefore we conclude that p <dig> is a negative regulator of malat <dig>  over expression of p <dig> may play a therapy effect to target inhibition of oncogenic malat <dig> level in cells.

proliferation suppression by down regulation of malat <dig> in hematopoietic cells
apparently, our study has proved malat <dig> down regulates in late stage hematopoietic progenitors and more differentiated primitive cells, and malat <dig> gene expression is inhibited by tumor repressor p <dig> protein. if down regulation of malat <dig> leads to hematopoietic differentiation via proliferation inhibition? in order to answer this question, we interfered malat <dig> expression of eml cells, in this study malat <dig> was down regulated with 7– <dig> fold , but hematopoietic differentiation marker gata <dig> and eklf <dig> didn’t significantly change the expression level . hence over expression of malat <dig> can’t directly drive the hematopoietic differentiation, however, the down regulation of this gene can significantly reduced hematopoietic cell  proliferation rate , whereas, we speculate one of the ability for malat <dig> is maintained the proliferation potential of hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors. this result is also consistent with the studies from knockdown of malat <dig> in myoblast  <cit> . based on these studies we proposed a model regarding malat <dig> function , during hematopoietic differentiation of eml cells by retinoic acid exposure, ra induces up regulation of gata <dig> and eklf <dig>  then initiates hematopoietic differentiation; in the meantime, up regulation of p <dig> also results in regulation of downstream gene expression including negative regulation of malat <dig>  thus causes proliferation suppression. the mechanisms for malat <dig> rna regulating cell proliferation are still unclear.

CONCLUSIONS
malat <dig> is one of the most significant molecules of long non-coding rna , which is commonly up regulated in malignant cells, hence it is usually considered as a biomarker of some type of cancers. our research has clarified the aspects of normal biological function and transcriptional regulation during hematopoiesis. a, malat <dig> down regulates during hematopoietic differentiation induced via atra; b, p <dig> is a negative regulator of malat <dig> expression through binding to its promoter region; c, malat1plays a critical role in maintaining the proliferation potential of early-stage hematopoietic cells. in summary, our research is the first report that malat <dig> plays a role in maintaining the proliferation potential of hematopoietic cells. and malat <dig> is transcriptionally regulated by tumor suppressor p <dig> during atra induced hematopoiesis.
