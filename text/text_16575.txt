BACKGROUND
venomous taxa have evolved many times within the metazoa  <cit> , and occur in both vertebrates and invertebrates. the venoms these diverse taxa produce are chemically complex and play key roles in organismal ecology, functioning in both predation and defense. molecules contributing to the toxicity of venom are the focus of sustained effort aimed at characterizing their physiological roles and biochemical action, given their potential in pharmacological and biomedical applications  <cit> . venom toxins are often members of large gene families, and the study of their evolution can illuminate the roles of gene duplication, convergence and positive selection in generating the functional diversity of venoms  <cit> . determining the molecular diversity of venoms is the necessary first step in this process, yet few studies have utilized large scale approaches for venom characterization.

spiders  are the most species-rich venomous clade, with > <dig>  described species  <cit> , the overwhelming majority of which are venomous. estimates of the number of unique venom peptides and proteins produced by members of this clade range from  <dig>  -  <dig> million , significantly more than are estimated from other major clades of venomous invertebrates such as scorpions and cone snails  <cit> . the venoms of some spiders have been extensively studied, largely due to the potential for isolating novel insecticidal toxins  <cit> , and reasons of direct medical concern . however, past work has focused on a small fraction of total spider species, and much of the molecular diversity of spider venoms remains to be discovered.

spider venom proteins characterized to date belong to several different broad classes: enzymes , small linear cytolytic peptides, and neurotoxins with differing functionality and size range  <cit> . the most commonly documented form of spider neurotoxin is a small , disulfide-rich peptide. the disulfide bonds give rise to one of three typical structural motifs, the disulfide-directed β-hairpin, the kunitz motif, or the inhibitor cystine knot , the last of which appears to be the most common amongst studied spider venoms  <cit> . the compact structure of ick peptides renders them highly resistant to the actions of proteases in envenomated organisms, contributing to their efficacy  <cit> . different ick peptides specifically target different ion channels in the nervous system  <cit> , and diverse sets of these peptides can occur within the venom of even a single species  <cit> , acting synergistically with one another and with small linear peptides  <cit>  in a manner similar to the “toxin cabals” of cone snails  <cit> .

the most prominent exception to this venom small-molecule  dominance occurs in the black widow spiders , which contain multiple large  neurotoxic proteins known as latrotoxins, encoded by paralogous loci . the best studied of the latrotoxins, α-latrotoxin, forms tetrameric complexes which bind to vertebrate presynaptic receptors and insert into neuronal membranes, forming calcium-permeable ion channels that stimulate massive neurotransmitter release  <cit> . α-latrotoxin is also widely known as the causative agent of the extreme pain associated with black widow bites. other functionally characterized latrotoxins differ in their phyletic specificity, affecting the nervous systems of only insects or crustaceans. latrotoxin proteins are accompanied in the venom by low-molecular weight peptides called latrodectins  that may enhance latrotoxin toxicity  <cit> , although they exhibit no toxicity themselves  <cit> .

given the large number of peptides and proteins remaining to be discovered in the venoms of spider species, next generation rna sequencing  methods are particularly well suited for rapidly obtaining a comprehensive inventory of venom components, as well as an improved functional understanding of the venom gland. the high-throughput of next-generation sequencing allows for profiling of transcripts over a wide range of abundance  <cit> , providing an accurate picture of differential expression across tissues within an organism. a multi-tissue approach allows for the identification of transcripts with highly biased expression in the venom gland, whose products are candidates for function in the venom as toxins, or in venom production. venom gland specific sequences can then be subjected to bioinformatic and evolutionary analyses to discover novel toxins and to better understand their origins and the mechanisms generating their diversity. the insights provided by transcriptomic data can be greatly enhanced by proteomics approaches which permit a direct examination of the peptide and protein composition of venoms, typically with methods coupling liquid chromatography based separation to mass spectrometry  <cit> . these methods have begun to be applied to a range of species, leading to an expansion of the number of venom peptide and protein toxins known from arachnids  <cit> .

in this study we present an integrated set of multi-tissue transcriptomic and proteomic data from the western black widow spider, latrodectus hesperus, to investigate the composition and evolution of its venom. the venom of this species remains largely unexplored, despite the relevance of black widows to human health and the importance of their venom in studies of vertebrate neurotransmission . we identify transcripts with biased expression in the venom gland relative to other tissues, and potential toxin transcripts in the venom gland exome, using bioinformatics-based approaches. we also explore the relative abundance of transcripts specific to the venom gland and quantify the representation of the biological functions and processes in which these transcripts take part. we identify prominent toxin families, and perform phylogenetic analyses to investigate their evolution. lastly, we explicitly identify the secreted peptide and protein component of the venom using a mass spectrometric based proteomic approach. our transcriptome and proteome provide complementary data in order to separate the secreted venom components from the cast of molecules that support toxin production within the gland.

RESULTS
bioinformatic functional categorization of the l. hesperus venom gland transcriptome
rna-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced from three l. hesperus tissue types:  venom glands ,  silk glands ,  cephalothorax with venom glands removed . sequencing reads from each tissue-specific library were separately assembled with trinity and the three transcript sets were merged with cap <dig>  <cit>  to produce a non-redundant set of sequences. this resulted in a transcriptome comprised of  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  of which were retained as unique assembled transcripts  after filtering out sequences encoding identical proteins . transcripts were submitted to a suite of analyses to investigate their identity, diversity and function in the venom gland, as well as the presence of their products in the venom . six-hundred ninety-five  of the  <dig>  transcripts had expected venom gland counts per million  greater than one and were either exclusively expressed in the venom gland , or were among the top  <dig> % in the distribution of the ratio of venom gland ecpm values to both silk and cephalothorax. this equates to a level of expression in the venom gland that is at least 306-fold higher than that in silk, and at least 32-fold higher than in cephalothorax. we hereafter refer to this set of  <dig> sequences as venom gland specific transcripts . of the vsts,  <dig>  had a significant  blastx hit to the uniprot database, while  <dig>  had no significant blastx hit to uniprot at this e-value cutoff . among vsts were  <dig> with significant blast similarity to known venom toxins, as well as to  <dig> enzymes that may act to facilitate toxin action . a total of  <dig> go terms were mapped to  <dig> sequences in the vst set. goseq analysis recovered  <dig> go terms that were overrepresented in the vsts compared to all transcripts with an ecpm >  <dig> at a false discovery rate  cutoff of  <dig>  . overrepresented categories for vsts in the cellular component ontology included  extracellular region,  other organism cell membrane and  other organism presynaptic membrane. exocytosis and proteolysis were significantly overrepresented categories in the biological process ontology, while serine endopeptidase and metalloprotease activity were among the overrepresented categories in the molecular function ontology.figure  <dig>

of the  <dig> vsts,  <dig> had at least one protein domain prediction from interproscan, including  <dig> sequences with no significant blast hit at uniprot. among all protein domains identified more than five times amongst the vsts, ankyrin domains were most common, while leucine-rich repeat, low density lipoprotein receptor class a, immunoglobulin, chitin-binding, helix loop helix, latrotoxin c-terminal, venom allergen  <dig>  serine protease and metalloprotease domains also commonly occurred in predicted proteins from the vst set .

l. hesperus toxin diversity and evolution
latrotoxins
the majority of the diversity among vsts with blast homology to known toxins was contributed by latrotoxins. strikingly, the number of distinct sequences found suggests a wider range of latrotoxin diversity than previously reported  <cit> . a total of  <dig> vst sequences were identified as latrotoxins. latrotoxins are large proteins, and range from ~ <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length , posing a challenge for transcript reconstruction from short-read data. the predicted latrotoxin proteins from the l. hesperus transcriptome varied in length, and many appear to be fragments of larger proteins. we aligned the  <dig> latrotoxin sequences in the set with a predicted protein of at least  <dig> amino acids with ten additional complete or near full-length latrotoxin sequences from latrodectus and steatoda species from the ncbi nr database. a bayesian phylogenetic tree produced from this alignment included four sub-clades each containing one of the four functionally characterized latrotoxins from l. tredecimguttatus, together with conserved orthologs assembled from our l. hesperus short-read data . however, the majority of l. hesperus sequences we assembled with homology to latrotoxins were not contained within these four clades and were instead dispersed among multiple highly supported clades. the maximum-likelihood topology was identical to the bayesian tree with the exception of the placement of two sequences  as unresolved branches at the base of the tree, instead of together in a clade .figure  <dig>

seven latrotoxin protein sequences inferred from l. hesperus vsts possessed a start codon as well as the distinctive latrotoxin c-terminal domain  <cit> , followed by a 3′ utr, suggesting that they are full-length or near full-length copies. we examined the domain structure of these putative full-length latrotoxins. multiple ankyrin repeats  were predicted in each of these sequences, and the number of repeats ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per sequence. variation was also evident when comparing l. hesperus protein sequences with the functionally characterized orthologs from l. tredecimguttatus . one sequence, venom_comp106397_c0_seq <dig> , groups closely with l. tredecimguttatus δ-latroinsectotoxin , but has  <dig> repeats, as opposed to  <dig> in the published sequence from l. tredecimguttatus <cit> . the l. hesperus ortholog of α-latroinsectotoxin has  <dig> ankyrin repeats, as does that of l. tredecimguttatus. other novel l. hesperus latrotoxin sequences had either  <dig> or  <dig> ankyrin repeats .figure  <dig>

we searched the entire translated l. hesperus transcriptome to identify other sequences with homology to latrotoxins, but lacking venom gland biased expression. as ankyrin domains are common components of many non-homologous proteins with diverse functions, we limited the blastp search to the conserved and distinct n-terminus of the latrotoxin protein, which lacks ankyrin repeats. two hits were recovered. however, read count data indicate that they lack expression in tissues other than venom gland, and were not included as vsts because they did not reach the minimum read count threshold for inclusion. these two sequences were not included in phylogenetic analyses, as they did not meet the minimum length requirement.

ick toxins and other small proteins with potential toxicity
the most common type of toxin in many spider venoms, as well as in scorpion, cone snail and remipede venoms  <cit>  are small disulfide-bonded neurotoxins with an inhibitor cystine knot  structural motif. previously, ick toxins were not considered to be a part of latrodectus venom, instead potentially being replaced by latrotoxins  <cit> . however, ick toxins were recently reported from l. tredecimguttatus <cit> , and our study revealed that sequences encoding these small peptides were also present among the l. hesperus vsts. specifically, four sequences had blastx hits of e- <dig> or better to members of the spider cstx toxin superfamily in uniprot. each of the predicted proteins from these sequences had  <dig> cysteine residues, and an ick scaffold predicted by both knoter1d and interproscan, containing three inferred disulfide bonds .figure  <dig>

we aligned our four predicted ick toxin protein sequences  with  <dig> sequences retrieved from the toxprot database  <cit> , representing the range of diversity across the uniprot defined spider cstx toxin superfamily. the bayesian and ml trees from this alignment were identical in topology with the exception of two sequences  that exchanged positions . the l. hesperus sequences form their own strongly supported clade  within the cstx superfamily. the most closely related sequences forming a larger clade with the l. hesperus icks are ick toxins from three species in the distantly related superfamily amaurobioidea  <cit> . all of these sequences share a conserved  <dig> cysteine framework  <cit> , but with substantial variation in the number of residues  between cysteines  <dig> and  <dig>  two of the sequences in this clade  have demonstrated cytolytic and/or calcium-channel blocking activity  <cit> . using the four ick toxin predicted proteins as queries, a blastp search of the full l. hesperus transcriptome assembly was also performed to identify related sequences lacking venom gland specificity. this search returned a single hit, which appears to be a fragment of an ick protein that was expressed exclusively in the venom gland, but did not meet the minimum expression level  for inclusion in the venom gland specific set.figure  <dig>

small proteins  that are comparatively cysteine-rich , are potential candidates for novel ick toxins. predicted proteins meeting these criteria are in excess in the vsts  compared to the overall transcriptome  considering only proteins with an n-terminal methionine. of the  <dig> vst sequences that met this definition,  <dig> did not have a blast hit to uniprot at e- <dig> or better. seven of the  <dig> without a blast hit had a predicted ick scaffold from knoter1d although none had this scaffold predicted by interproscan . four of the seven were also strongly predicted as toxins , while one was categorized as possibly toxin-like . these seven proteins ranged in length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, possessed 8– <dig> cysteines , and may represent additional instances of distinct ick toxins in the l. hesperus venom-specific transcriptome, for a total of  <dig> table  <dig>

crisp proteins and enzymes
two transcripts in the venom gland specific set had blast homology to cysteine-rich secretory proteins of the crisp family, which are common to the venom of numerous species  <cit> , while a third had a top blast hit to an uncharacterized protein, but grouped with the crisp sequences in clustering analysis . we searched the entire l. hesperus transcriptome for other closely related sequences with blastp , but lacking in venom gland biased expression. the l. hesperus transcriptome did contain three sequences most highly expressed in the cephalothorax or silk glands with blast homology to venom gland specific crisps, and with uniprot blastx hits to crisp family proteins. we conducted phylogenetic analysis on the alignment of l. hesperus crisp proteins with sequences from a range of venomous and non-venomous invertebrates that have blast homology to the l. hesperus crisps . at the largest scale, there were two clades in the bayesian and ml trees , which are highly similar with the exception of the placement of a few weakly supported sequences. all sampled spider sequences occur in one clade, together with most other arachnid crisps, including those that show evidence of expression in spider or scorpion venom glands. in contrast, some crisps with expression in salivary glands of hematophagous ticks are found in the largely arachnid clade, while others appear more closely related to insect crisps . the three l. hesperus venom gland specific crisps form a highly supported clade with a broadly expressed but closely related l. hesperus crisp. moreover, a number of scorpion venom gland expressed crisps group with a copy from the tick ixodes scapularis. other scorpion crisps occur in a different clade with all l. hesperus crisps, whether venom gland specific or not, along with venom gland expressed crisps from other spider species.figure  <dig>

transcripts with homology to several types of enzymes were found in the l. hesperus vst set. a total of two hyaluronidases, a single chitinase, and  <dig> lipases  were identified. a total of  <dig> distinct serine protease sequences and 8 m <dig> metalloproteases were found among the  <dig> in the venom gland specific set. in addition, single sequences with homology to o-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidases and gamma glutamyl transpeptidases were recovered .

clustering analysis of venom-gland specific proteins
we explored the relationships among vsts using blastclust on predicted proteins to identify putative gene families. under the most stringent clustering criterion ,  <dig> of  <dig> protein sequences did not group with any other sequence, and only  <dig> multiple transcript clusters occurred, with the largest containing  <dig> members. as the sequence identity was reduced while maintaining stringent  overlap, additional clusters were recovered to a maximum of  <dig> at ≥ 30% sequence identity. these  <dig> clusters contained  <dig> of  <dig> transcripts, and the largest cluster included only five sequences. relaxing the percent overlap of sequences while keeping the 95% sequence identity threshold produced a similar result, with  <dig> transcripts in  <dig> clusters, and a maximum cluster size of five, at ≥ 30% sequence overlap. when both criteria were relaxed, the number of transcripts in clusters increased rapidly below 65% sequence identity and 65% sequence overlap . the most pronounced increase in cluster size  occurred below 40% overlap and 40% identity, while the number of clusters decreased slightly. at the most permissive threshold for group formation , approximately 22% of transcripts belonged to  <dig> groups with at least one other member.figure  <dig>

l. hesperus
predicted proteins from vsts. clustering of sequences was performed across a range of sequence overlap and identity values.



there were several clusters with members homologous to known toxins. under the most permissive clustering criterion, the largest of these groups had  <dig> members, all but three of which had best blastx hits to latrotoxins in the uniprot database, with the other sequences likely clustered due to weak similarity in the ankyrin repeat regions. a second group contained four additional latrotoxin sequences. membership in the larger group was highly sensitive to the stringency of the clustering parameters, as at 35% overlap and 35% identity, only  <dig> sequences remained, all with homology to latrotoxins, and at 45% overlap and 45% identity this cluster had fragmented into several smaller clusters, the largest of which contained six members . the four sequences with homology to ick toxins also formed a group at the lowest clustering stringency, but this group appeared more coherent: these sequences remained clustered as stringency was increased until 75% overlap at 75% identity was reached.

other clusters containing more than five members at the most permissive threshold , and representing putative venom gland expressed families, included sequences with homology to cuticular proteins , m <dig> metalloproteases , leucine-rich repeat  proteins , and serine proteases , while the two crisp proteins identified by blast homology clustered with an uncharacterized protein.

highly expressed venom gland transcripts
substantial variation in abundance existed among vsts . however, a minority of sequences with blast homology to known toxins and associated proteins constituted a significant  proportion of overall vst expression . if the putative icks  are included this figure rises to 60%. toxin transcripts were common among the most highly expressed vsts and included sequences with blastx homology to known latrotoxins, ick toxins, crisp family toxins, and latrodectins . a number of proteases, as well as a chitinase, were amongst the most highly expressed transcripts, and proteases constitute approximately 11% of the overall expression . in addition,  <dig> of  <dig> small, disulfide-rich proteins with no blast hit, but with ick domain predictions, were amongst the most highly expressed vsts , as were two other small cysteine-rich proteins with no ick or clantox prediction. while only two distinct latrodectin sequences were found, they constituted approximately 16% of the total expression for all venom gland specific transcripts . in contrast, the latrotoxins contribute a similar proportion of transcript abundance  but are much richer in sequence diversity, with  <dig> sequences that likely represent at least  <dig> paralogs .figure  <dig>

proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of secreted components
using multidimensional protein identification technology  analyses, we identified  <dig> proteins from an l. hesperus protein database that matched peptides collected from l. hesperus venom with mass spectrometry techniques . the analyzed protein database contained  <dig>  l. hesperus proteins predicted from two transcript sets:   <dig>  from the overall l. hesperus transcriptome de novo assembly, and   <dig> venom gland ests, together with 414 l. hesperus proteins from ncbi’s nr database. the venom detected proteins included  <dig> latrotoxins,  <dig> ick toxin, and  <dig> crisp family toxin proteins . four other sequences from the cysteine-rich set of unknown proteins were also found in the venom, including two that potentially represent additional ick toxins . several types of enzymes were identified in l. hesperus venom, including hyaluronidases, chitinase, serine proteases and metalloproteases, as were several leucine-rich repeat proteins and three latrodectins . of the proteins matched, most  were predicted from vsts, while  <dig> were from transcripts that were venom gland biased, but were not in the upper  <dig> % of the distribution of ecpm ratio values. eight protein sequences predicted from venom gland ests, and one from a previous study of latrotoxins  <cit> , were also detected in l. hesperus venom.table  <dig>

approximately  <dig> %  of protein translations from the l. hesperus vsts possessed a predicted signal sequence. if only the  <dig> proteins with a putative methionine start codon are considered, this figure rises to  <dig> %. amongst the toxin homologs in this set, none of the predicted latrotoxin proteins contained a typical eukaryotic signal sequence, while four of four ick toxins, both crisp toxins, and both latrodectins, contained a signal sequence, as did all seven other potential ick toxins with no significant blast homology. five proteases  also had a predicted signal sequence. thirty-six of the  <dig> predicted proteins from vsts detected in venom by mass spectrometry contained an m-start, of which  <dig>  had predicted signal sequences, consistent with their function as a venom component, as opposed to having an intracellular function.

discussion
spiders are the most species-rich clade of venomous metazoans, and it is likely that millions of toxic compounds remain to be identified in their venom  <cit> . next generation transcriptomic and proteomic methods, when used in combination, offer a powerful approach to cataloguing and understanding this complexity, as well as its evolution. by applying these methods to latrodectus hesperus, in the context of a multi-tissue expression analysis, we have identified  <dig> transcript sequences with strongly biased venom gland expression in this species and confirmed the presence of  <dig> proteins in its venom. the inferred functions of these sequences indicate that the venom of black widow spiders is extremely diverse at the molecular level, and is the product of a complex evolutionary history.

molecular diversity in the l. hesperus venom gland and functional implications
we found that only 22% of the 695 l. hesperus vsts shared some sequence overlap at the protein level through blastclust analyses, implying that a wide diversity of proteins contribute to venom gland function. nevertheless, we estimated that at least  <dig> distinct latrotoxin paralogs are expressed in the black widow venom gland, constituting by far the largest gene family in the venom gland specific set of sequences. the latrotoxin proteins predicted from these transcripts were divergent in amino acid sequence and motif organization , and thus it is likely that they represent distinct loci. while seven latrotoxins have been assigned names based on their taxonomic specificity  in the related species l. tredecimguttatus <cit> , the sequence of only four of these seven functionally characterized latrotoxins are definitively known . we identified orthologs of these four functionally characterized latrotoxins in our transcriptome, but have also quintupled the number of sequenced latrotoxin paralogs in l. hesperus. while the functionality of these novel latrotoxins is unknown, some of these sequences have best blastx hits to the vertebrate-specific α-latrotoxin. although functional testing is a requirement for confirmation, some of these sequences could represent heretofore unknown vertebrate specific neurotoxins. such discoveries are significant because vertebrate neurotoxins have important applications in neurophysiological research, considering the fundamental role of α-latrotoxin in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. the extensive diversity found among the vertebrate receptors of latrotoxins such as neurexins and latrophilins , suggests that some of these new latrotoxin variants may interact specifically with different receptor isoforms and could play important roles in their characterization. the variable number of ankyrin domains predicted from nearly full-length sequences in this study could contribute to altered functionality, including the ability of latrotoxin monomers to tetramerize, given the role of ankyrin repeats in protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

small cysteine rich neurotoxic proteins with the inhibitor cystine knot motif dominate the venoms of many spider species  <cit> . our blast analyses identified four putative ick toxin sequences amongst the l. hesperus vsts and one was present in the exuded venom. in addition to these ick toxins, other small cysteine-rich sequences were venom gland specific in expression and some were present in the venom. some of these toxins may also be ick toxins as they possess a predicted ick domain, while others may represent distinctly different molecular scaffolds, although further research is necessary on their structure and function. the presence of both latrotoxins and ick toxins in latrodectus venom also suggests novel avenues in research as to how small, selective ion-channel toxins may act synergistically with the non-selective cation channels created by latrotoxin pores in the presynaptic membrane  <cit> . three additional cysteine-rich proteins with homology to crisp toxins  were also strongly biased towards expression in l. hesperus venom gland and present in the venom. crisp family members were also found to be expressed in the venom gland of the related species l. tredecimguttatus <cit> , indicating that this toxin type may be more widespread within the genus.

among the other venom gland specific transcripts were multiple sequences with homology to proteins with nervous system related functions . examples of these included bruchpilot from drosophila melanogaster, involved in synaptic plasticity and regulation  <cit>  and neural cell adhesion molecule l <dig>  the drosophila ortholog of which plays a critical role in neural development  <cit> . l1-type cell adhesion molecules also play a role in presynaptic organization, and often interact with ankyrin repeat containing proteins  <cit> . given the importance of the ankyrin repeat-containing latrotoxins in black widow venom, the venom gland biased expression of these transcripts is intriguing, although their links to the action of latrotoxins are speculative at this point. lastly, eight sequences with homology to leucine-rich repeat  proteins were also venom gland specific, and a number of these proteins play key roles in neuronal development and maintenance in both invertebrates and vertebrates  <cit> . these results suggest that homologs of spider proteins involved in neuronal development or function are being co-opted for venom expression, or the potential for molecular mimicry of neuronal proteins by unrelated venom gland expressed sequences.

evolutionary diversification of black widow venom toxins
the development of pools of diverse toxin molecules in venom often involves the expansion of gene families  <cit> . this process can generate large numbers of distinct transcripts and peptides in certain toxin classes. in cone snails, species may produce from 100– <dig> small ick peptides known as conotoxins  <cit> . conotoxins are notable for their rapid evolution and the extreme divergence among paralogs within a species at the amino acid level  <cit> . similarly, sequencing of spider venom gland transcripts has revealed single species ick toxin libraries containing more than  <dig> distinct members  <cit> . while ick toxin sequences can also differ dramatically among spiders, clades of more closely related sequences also occur in some spider species, and likely represent more recent, species-specific gene family diversification  <cit> . this may be true in the case of the l. hesperus sequences with blast homology to known icks. yet, we also found seven additional ick motif containing sequences, which were more diverse in length, signal sequence and cysteine arrangement, suggesting the recruitment of multiple ick motif encoding proteins for black widow venom expression.

latrotoxins, while the most diverse toxin type in this study, as a whole appear to be limited in phylogenetic distribution, and the origins of these toxins are obscure. only one paralog  has been recognized outside the genus latrodectus, and to date latrotoxins are only known from three genera of theridiidae  <cit> . although repeated ankyrin domains are found in a wide range of unrelated proteins of various functions  <cit> , the latrotoxin n-terminal region appears to be somewhat unique to latrotoxins. a blastp search with latrotoxin n-terminal sequences  against the non-venom gland specific l. hesperus transcriptome did not find any significant hits. however, we performed a blastp search with the l. hesperus α-latrotoxin n-terminal region against ncbi’s nr database, and found a significant hit to a hypothetical protein from diplorickettsia massiliensis , an obligate intracellular bacteria isolated from the tick ixodes ricinus, which is a human disease vector. in addition to n-terminal region sequence similarity, the overall length  and possession of multiple ankyrin repeats of this bacterial protein are reminiscent of latrotoxins. a recent study by zhang et al.  <cit>  described similarities between the c-terminal domain of latrotoxins and proteins from arthropod bacterial endosymbionts such as wolbachia and rickettsiella, and suggested that spider latrotoxins were acquired via lateral gene transfer from bacteria. alternatively, garb and hayashi  <cit>  suggested a possible link between latrotoxins and dtrp1a, a drosophila calcium permeable transmembrane channel protein involved in sensitivity to temperature and chemical irritation that contains numerous ankyrin repeats. as genome sequences for latrodectus and related theridiid species become available, these questions regarding the evolutionary origin of latrotoxins may become answerable.

given the broader phylogenetic distribution of α-latrotoxin outside of l. hesperus <cit> , it will be important to determine if the additional latrotoxins we uncovered have orthologs in closely related species having venom that is less toxic to vertebrates when compared to venom from black widows. phylogenetic analyses of the latrotoxin family across multiple species may illuminate the ecological adaptations of widow spiders, particularly in terms of understanding the functional utility of latrotoxins for a generalist predator of diverse insects and small vertebrates. three insect specific latrotoxins previously identified in protein separation studies  <cit>  may be represented in the additional latrotoxins we have recovered, but the functional and taxonomic specificity of the others remains to be determined. such functional analyses will be necessary to reconstruct whether ancestral latrotoxins have undergone a functional shift from arthropod to vertebrate specificity or vice versa. a comprehensive latrotoxin phylogeny across species could also determine whether gene family expansions are lineage-specific, and correlate with increased venom toxicity and diet breadth.

in contrast to latrotoxins and ick toxins, the cysteine-rich secretory proteins  are not particularly diverse within the l. hesperus vsts, but we were able to identify three additional transcripts with homology to crisps that do not show venom gland specificity. a crisp phylogeny including diverse venomous, non-venomous and hematophagous arthropods indicates a dynamic evolutionary history for this gene family, with multiple recruitments to function in venom or salivary glands, including a potentially recent crisp protein recruitment for venom function in latrodectus. a similar conclusion was reached with a less densely sampled, but broader taxonomic selection of crisps  <cit> , and more extensive arthropod transcriptomic and genomic resources may identify the gene duplications and changes in tissue-specific expression patterns leading to this pattern.

highly expressed transcripts, venom composition and secretory mechanisms
among the venom gland specific transcript set, overall expression is dominated by putative neurotoxins and their associated molecules, although they make up only a minority of the distinct transcripts. strikingly, the proportion of transcripts that latrodectins represent is similar to that for all latrotoxin sequences, although latrodectin sequence diversity was at least ten times lower than that of latrotoxins. this suggests that the role of latrodectins in facilitating latrotoxin toxicity may be the same for all latrotoxins, including novel forms identified in this study. protease expression also accounts for a substantial proportion of vst abundance, and several proteases were amongst the most abundant transcripts in the venom gland specific set.

proteomic analysis of l. hesperus venom also indicates that at least some proteases are secreted, as together with other enzymes , they were identified in l. hesperus venom. hyaluronidases are found in venom from a range of spider species  <cit> , but whether proteases are an active component of venom in spiders has been a subject of some debate, as some authors argue that protease activity in venom is due to digestive secretion contamination  <cit> . our finding of proteases with venom gland specificity, together with the presence of a subset of proteases in the venom, some with predicted secretory signal sequences, may be related to a dual function. some l. hesperus proteases may in fact function in prey immobilization, either acting as toxin spreading factors, or in hemostasis disruption, as is the case in snakes  <cit> , while others may be involved in processing toxin preproproteins into mature toxins  <cit> .

our mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the majority of the neurotoxin transcripts specific to the venom gland encoded peptides and proteins that were secreted into the venom. predicted neurotoxins that were not present in collected venom may reflect the variability inherent in venom-related gene expression, as data acquisition for the transcriptome and proteome was performed on different individuals. it may also reflect variation in the processes of translation or secretion among individual spiders. overall, the limited number of venom gland specific genes whose products are found in the venom itself is rather unexpected, given the purported mechanism of l. hesperus secretion into the venom gland lumen, in which the secretory cells disintegrate and expel the entirety of their contents  <cit> . yet there would appear to be some filtering mechanism that is selective against most proteins from vsts, as few appear in the venom itself. the possession of a signal sequence may constitute such a filter. while only a minority  of complete predicted proteins from vsts have a predicted signal sequence, the majority of proteins  identified in the venom by mass spectrometry have predicted signals. latrotoxins seem to be an exception, lacking a typical eukaryotic secretion signal, yet being common in the venom itself. however, previous work has indicated the presence of a cleaved sequence on the n-terminus that could potentially function as a non-canonical secretory signal  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, next-generation rna sequencing of multiple tissues coupled to proteomics has provided a wealth of insight into venom gland expression and the molecular complexity of latrodectus venom. numerous new variants of known toxins were identified, and potentially novel toxins of unknown function recovered, suggesting the need for a fundamental reconsideration of the functional activities of black widow spider venom in natural prey and in human envenomation. the extreme pain associated with black widow spider bites is typically accompanied by additional symptoms , which in addition to α-latrotoxin, may be caused by other toxins uncovered in this study. this expanded toxin library can also be mined for novel molecular probes or drug leads. of particular interest for neurophysiology is the large number  of previously unknown latrotoxin variants and  <dig> ick motif containing proteins discovered in this study, which may offer new avenues for dissecting the molecular mechanism of neurotransmitter release and for characterizing neuronal ion channels. these functionally diverse latrotoxins comprise a large venom gland expressed gene family with a highly restricted phylogenetic distribution, suggesting they have undergone a rapid evolutionary expansion in black widow spiders.
