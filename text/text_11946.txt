BACKGROUND
plant transcription factors
transcription factors  play key roles in signal transduction pathways in all living organisms. they are proteins able to recognize and bind specific dna sequences  present in the regulatory regions of their target genes. in general, these proteins have a modular structure and exhibit at least two types of domains: a dna binding domain and a protein-protein interaction domain which mediates, directly or indirectly, the activation or repression of transcription  <cit> .

in plants, several tf families have been identified but only a relatively small number of members have been functionally studied  <cit> . such identification was performed essentially in plants whose genome has been sequenced, e.g. arabidopsis, for which a comparison with known animal tfs indicated the existence of about  <dig> tfs  <cit> . tf families are classified according to their binding domain and divided in subfamilies according to additional structural and functional characteristics  <cit> .

the hd-zip family of transcription factors
among the identified tf families, the hd-zip family is composed of proteins bearing a homeodomain associated to a leucine zipper , association unique to plants. due to this specific association and knowing that hd proteins in other kingdoms are involved in development, hd-zip proteins were proposed as key players in plant specific developmental processes, such as those associated to external stimuli and stresses  <cit> . four groups, named i to iv, have been identified fundamentally based on four particular characteristics: sequence conservation within the hd-zip domain, the presence of additional conserved domains, gene structure and the pathways in which these proteins participate . hd-zip iii and iv members are, on average, the largest proteins; they exhibit a start  and sad  domains towards the c-terminus in relation to the hd-zip domain  <cit> , plus a mekhla  domain in subfamily iii proteins  <cit> . hd-zip ii tfs also have a distinguishing feature in their c-terminus, the cpsce motif responsible for redox regulation of protein activity  <cit> , and the zibel motif in their n-terminus  <cit> . no common feature outside the hd-zip domain has been assigned to subfamily i tfs.

what is known about hd-zip subfamily i members
hd-zip i group has  <dig> members in arabidopsis thaliana divided in six classes according to their phylogenetic relationships and intron/exon distribution: α , β , γ , δ , ε  and φ   <cit> . the encoded proteins tested for binding specificity in vitro recognize the same pseudopalindromic sequence with the highest affinity  <cit> . this affinity, but not the specificity of this protein-dna interaction is affected by the aminoacids of the homeodomain n-terminal arm  <cit> .

athb <dig> and athb <dig>  coded by paralogous genes, share 80% identity in the hd-zip domain amino acid sequence. both genes are regulated by drought stress in an abscicic acid -dependent way  <cit> . their developmental expression pattern is similar but athb <dig> expression is detectable in lateral root primordia, young leaves and inflorescence stems while athb <dig> is not, at least under normal growth conditions. when aba is exogenously applied, their expression patterns overlap  <cit> . the constitutive expression of athb <dig> in the wassilewskija  genotype generates a developmental delay and a characteristic morphological phenotype  while the silencing of this gene apparently does not alter the phenotype  <cit> . athb <dig> overexpressors are similar to athb <dig> transgenic plants  <cit> . both transgenic genotypes presented also increased lateral branching of the stem compared with the wt  genotype. in both cases the phenotype in roots is aba dependent while the phenotype in stems is aba independent  <cit> . the characterization of athb <dig> mutants and athb <dig> overexpressing plants indicated that this gene product is somehow inhibiting the expression of the gene encoding the ga-20-oxidase, leading to the short stem phenotype due to a reduction in gibberellins content  <cit> .

our research group has characterized hahb <dig>  a sunflower hd-zip i protein sharing 60% and 53% identity respectively with athb <dig> and - <dig> in the hd-zip domain  <cit> . however, hahb <dig> has a short carboxy-terminal region  while athb <dig> and  <dig> present  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in this region, respectively. hahb <dig> expression is very low in normal growth conditions and it is up regulated in roots, stems and leaves by aba, mannitol, nacl, drought and darkness as well as by jasmonic acid  and ethylene   <cit> . the phenotype observed when this sunflower gene is ectopically expressed in arabidopsis plants strongly resembles that of athb7/ <dig> overexpressing plants  <cit> . however, hahb <dig> plants exhibited drought tolerance and a senescence delay while athb <dig> and  <dig> did not. moreover, when hahb <dig> seedlings were treated with exogenous acc  the plants did not present the typical triple response to ethylene  <cit> . this observation together with a microarray analysis indicated that hahb <dig> inhibits the expression of ethylene receptors and thereafter the ability to sense this hormone  <cit> .

another pair of paralogous genes, athb <dig> and athb <dig>  code for proteins which share 78% identity in the hd-zip domain and  <dig> and 77% identity, respectively, with the hd-zip domain of the sunflower hahb <dig>  <cit> . the morphological characteristics of transgenic plants expressing athb <dig> and hahb <dig> genes under the camv 35s promoter are similar; e.g. serrated leaves, differential cotyledons phenotype when grown in sucrose 4% .

is the hd-zip domain sufficient for the function of hd-zip i tfs?
the proteins encoded by the above mentioned genes , athb <dig>  athb <dig> and cphb <dig> bind in vitro with maximal affinity the same target sequence  <cit> . notably when transgenic plants in which these or other hd-zip i encoding genes were expressed in arabidopsis under the camv 35s promoter, the resultant phenotypes were clearly different with the exception of those genes phylogenetically closely related. these facts strongly suggest that the function of these genes may be significantly determined by other characteristics in addition to differences in expression patterns and target gene preferences.

in this sense, previous works have supported the functionality of the ctrs of hd-zip i proteins. it was shown that this portion of athb <dig> is capable of transcriptional activation in yeast one-hybrid experiments  <cit>  and functional complementation of a nacl-sensitive calcineurin -deficient yeast mutant, only when the protein has a complete ctr  <cit> .

sakuma et al.  <cit>  identified hvhox <dig>  a putative paralogue of vrs <dig>  by observing the effect caused in the hordeum vulgare spikelets development. these two genes, both encoding hd-zip i proteins, differ particularly in the ctr. hvhox <dig> exhibits  <dig> additional amino acids compared with vrs <dig>  these authors identified a conserved motif in this portion of the protein and suggested that it could interact with certain classes of co-activators in order to exert its biological function, as it has been proposed for hahb <dig>  <cit> .

tl  is a garden pea hd-zip protein which mutation  generates plants with a particular phenotype: tendrils are converted to leaflets, they are no longer inhibited from completing laminar development. notably, a mutant in which this gene codes for a protein lacking  <dig> amino acids in its ctr exhibited the same phenotype as a mutant unable to express the gene  <cit> .

based on the literature data and on our own observations we aimed to put in evidence that the ctrs and ntrs  may be playing an important role in the signalling networks in which hd-zip proteins participate, determining to some extent their functionality. we used bioinformatics to detect new sequence motifs in the ntrs and ctrs of the hd-zip i proteins. further, we experimentally tested the function of a ctr by making chimeric constructs and uncovered a motif specific function.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of hd-zip proteins from different species resolved six different clades
an in silico analysis was performed on a set of  <dig> sequences from hd-zip i transcription factors from different species . they were selected merging the database of proteins from species with sequenced genomes  <cit>  and a set retrieved from ncbi's conserved domain architecture retrieval tool .

the initial approach involved the construction of three phylogenetic trees: the first with the subsequences comprising the hd and the halz domains of each protein , the second with this same subset plus three hd-zip ii proteins from arabidopsis which were used as outgroup , and the last with the complete sequences of the proteins . the subset of sequences used for the hzt and hzt + og was obtained using hmmer  <cit>  and the corresponding hmm models  <cit> .

the sequences were aligned with mafft   <cit>  and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed using phyml  <cit>  with  <dig> bootstrap replicates for the hzt and hzt + og, and  <dig> bootstrap replicates for the czt . as expected, the three hd-zip ii proteins formed a separate clade in the hzt + og and its relative location was used to root the three trees.

the hzt was considered the reference tree because it was constructed with a sequence alignment obtained exclusively from the sites which are homologous to all the hd-zip i proteins analyzed. the initial strategy involved the comparative analysis of the hzt and cst, and the manual inspection of the alignment of the complete sequences. overall, major clades with moderate or good statistical support in the hzt and cst had, with some exceptions, a very similar composition. sequence alignments in the ntrs and ctrs revealed evident sequence conservation for most proteins in each clade. based on both observations, a total of  <dig> proteins were divided in six groups . as can be seen in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  each group has a reasonably distinctive ctr with variable-length stretches of highly conserved amino acids. the informational content in these regions can be appreciated by the increase in bootstrap values for most of these clades in the cst where the ntrs and ctrs are considered .

bootstrap values for the different clades identified in the trees hzt and czt. pph paraphyletic.

grouping was mainly aimed at recognizing common potentially functional characteristics in the sequences of groups of hd-zip i proteins. consequently, although group i had a high bootstrap support value, it was further divided in three subgroups: ia, ib and ic; according to sequence conservation, particularly in the ctr . conversely, the conservation in the ntr and ctr  of proteins from groups iii and iv together with the significant bootstrap values in the cst supported grouping of clades of proteins with weak bootstrap values in the hzt.

groups i, ii, iii, v and vi were formed of proteins from dicots and monocots, excluding the  <dig> proteins from mosses, lycophytes, ferns and conifers; and  <dig> proteins from dicots. the  <dig> tfs from the moss physcomitrella patens formed a separate clade named pp group. the species with sequenced genomes had at least one member in each group, with the exception of poplar in group iii and arabidopsis in group iv, the only group exclusively formed of proteins from dicots.

the high conservation of key residues in the hd-zip i homeodomains suggests little target-sequence variation
certain residues in the hd, particularly in the helix iii and a flexible n-terminal arm are important determinants of the sequence preferentially bound by the hd-zip i tfs  <cit> . the alignment of the hd and halz sequences corresponding to the proteins of the dataset analyzed  shows a very high conservation of the amino acids in these homeodomain positions, i.e.: k2: 74%, k3: 94%, r5: 93%, i/v47: 54/46%, q50: 100%, n51: 99% and r55: 100% . this result suggests that target-sequence variation may not be a major source of functional diversity within the subfamily i of hd-zip tfs.

hd-zip proteins from each clade present conserved motifs in their ctrs
previous experimental evidence supporting the functionality of the ctrs of a few hd-zip i proteins  <cit>  lead us to further explore this region. from the alignment of the ctrs, the only evident feature was a bias in w composition towards the last residues of the protein. the histogram in figure  <dig> shows that w was significantly enriched in the final tenth part of the ctrs of the  <dig> proteins studied.

in order to deepen the analysis of the ctrs, a motif discovery approach was conducted using the meme program  <cit> . a single run with all the sequences  yielded motifs with e-values ranging from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  figure  <dig> illustrates the motif composition and location in each ctr; the sequence logos of each motif are presented in figure  <dig> 

most of the motifs found were highly or completely group specific, only group vi lacked distinctive motifs. nonetheless, there is one clear exception: motif  <dig> appears in most members of groups iii, iv and v and in many p. patens proteins. its distinguishing features are: an enrichment in ser with two occupying conserved positions separated by six residues, and several acidic amino acids.

on the basis of motif distribution, the ctr could be roughly divided in two regions: a proximal region, adjacent to the halz; and a distal region, comprising the final part of the protein. the former involved up to three concatenated motifs adjacent to the halz  and/or a motif located around the central portion of the ctr ; while the latter was characterized by a motif covering the last residues, which in groups ic, ii, iv, v and pp was accompanied by an adjacent motif towards the n-terminus .

the analysis of the different motifs according to their position and composition revealed a remarkable feature; the presence of one or more trp with high frequencies in all the motifs at the end of the proteins . another aromatic amino acid with high frequencies was phe, present in most of the motifs in the distal region . additionally, many positions were occupied by acid residues and a few by pro . this sequence features highly resemble those of aha motifs found in hsf  tfs  <cit> .

in the motifs found in the proximal region of the ctr, the residues with the highest frequencies were ser and acidic amino acids . since ser are potential phosphorylation sites and transcription factors constitute preferential candidates for this type of modification  <cit> , we explored the predicted possibility of phosphorylation in ser, thr and tyr with the program netphos  <dig>   <cit> . using a cutoff score of  <dig> , the results showed that many of the high-frequency ser in these motifs are predicted targets of phosphorylation, particularly those present in motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , most of which were in the proximal region of the ctr .

interesting results were obtained when another type of putative post-translational modification was analyzed, sumoylation. sumo is mainly conjugated to the k in the motif Ψkxe/d   <cit> . this peptide appears with a high frequency in motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 12; the last present in the proximal region and the other in the distal region, adjacent to the terminal motif. to further address this observation, we searched for the degenerated motif in all the ctrs, Ψ being f, v, i, m or l. the motif was found  <dig> times in  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins. moreover, the last position was mostly e: the motif Ψkxe corresponds to  <dig> of the  <dig> motifs found, and they are distributed in  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins. there was also a bias towards the identity of the hydrophobic residue: v > i > l > m > f . the sumoylation motifs were mainly present in groups i , ii, v and the pp group . in groups ii and v they were found twice per protein.

as a rudimentary test of the significance of these results, the motif Ψkx- in which the last position could be any of the  <dig> amino acids but glu or asp was searched. a total of  <dig> motifs in  <dig> proteins were found, which compared to the appearances of the canonical motif /:  <dig> ) puts in evidence the overrepresentation of putative sumo conjugation sites.

the ntrs also present some conserved motifs
the ntrs were analyzed applying a similar motif-discovery strategy. the program meme elicited  <dig> motifs with e-values ranging from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  motifs logos and distribution are illustrated in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  group definition was somehow supported by this distribution, with some exceptions. motif  <dig> is widely distributed appearing in groups ii , iii, iv and pp. subgroups ia, ib and ic lacked distinctive motifs, and group ii was divided in monocots and dicots by unshared motifs. it should be noted that group vi, which had no distinctive motifs in the ctr, was distinguished by motif  <dig> in the ntr.

in the attempt of finding putative functional significance to the motifs of the ntr, the program netphos was employed to predict probable phosphorylation sites with a cutoff of  <dig>  . the ser residues in motifs  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  are the best candidates for this post-traslational modification because they are also highly conserved.

the program nlstradamus  <cit>  was used to predict nuclear localization signals  in the complete proteins. this signal was found only in  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins; among them, three had it in the ctr , and the other  <dig> in the ntr. of these  <dig>  six nlss belonged to proteins from group vi  and fell within motif  <dig>  found in  <dig> of the members .

in order to make a comparison with the sumoylation results obtained with the ctrs, the motif Ψkxe/d was searched in the ntrs. only eight motifs were found , seven exhibit a glu in the last position and four of them a val in the first position. despite amino acid frequencies showed some analogy with those in sumoylation motifs found in the ctrs; the number of sites found is negligible to consider sumoylation an important general modification in hd-zip i ntrs. to reinforce this conclusion, the motif Ψkx- was searched in the ntrs: it appeared  <dig> times in  <dig> proteins /:  <dig> ), in contrast with the results obtained with the ctrs /:  <dig> ).

athb <dig> ctr acts as an activation domain in yeast cells
in order to determine the putative activator action of the ctr motif in these tfs, one member of group iii, athb <dig>  was analyzed. genetic constructs in which the whole cdna or a mutated version, where the ctr was deleted, were obtained and yeast cells  were transformed with these as well as with the appropriate control constructs . the positive colonies grown in the medium lacking trp were transferred to a medium lacking his in which only the cells with the ability to transactivate can grow. cells bearing the complete cdna or just the ctr grew in this medium while the cells transformed with the truncated construct and those transformed with the empty vector did not . the empty vector bears the adh <dig> promoter directing the expression of the gal <dig> transcription factor dna-binding domain; this construct is not able to transactivate and therefore, the cells transformed with it cannot live in a selective medium. colonies were also tested for β-galactosidase activity and the results supported the growth assay . these observations indicated that the ctr is the region responsible for the transactivation activity of this tf, at least in yeast.

the phenotype of the plants transformed with chimerical constructs is similar to that of the plants transformed with the ctr donor protein
in order to determine the importance of the ctr in the structure/function relationship of hd-zip proteins, we have chosen two well characterized members of this transcription factors family to perform chimerical constructs and evaluate the phenotypes in transgenic plants. hahb <dig> inhibits the triple response to ethylene when it is ectopically expressed in arabidopsis while hahb <dig>  like its homologue athb <dig>  confers a serrated shape to leaves . in relation to the in silico analysis, hahb <dig> fell in group v and hahb <dig> in group i, outside the three subgroups with characteristic ctrs. no motifs were found in hahb <dig> ntr  or ctr ; it has two trp in the final residues, with the particularity of being adjacent to a lys, not usual in aha motifs. hahb <dig> possesses motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ctr ; and motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ntr .

mutant and chimerical genetic constructs were performed to evaluate the ctr functionality. the ctr of hahb <dig> was fused to the hd-zip of hahb <dig>  and both cdnas were deleted in their ctrs forming h1wct  and h4wct , as depicted in figure 7a. fused to the 35s camv promoter, these constructs were used to transform arabidopsis plants. three independent lines of each genotype presenting differential expression levels were chosen for further analysis .

seedlings were grown in  <dig> μm acc, an ethylene precursor, and photographs taken when they were four-day-old. figure 7c illustrates the phenotype observed for sensitive and insensitive plants while in figure 7d the proportions of insensitive plants in eight groups of  <dig> plants from each line subjected to this treatment is depicted with a box plot. transgenic plants with high expression levels of hahb <dig>  were used as controls and did not show the apical hook, as expected, while a low expression-level line  presented a high percentage of acc sensitive plants. h4wct exhibited a moderate insensitivity to acc. h1wct and h4-h <dig> plants showed more sensitivity than h4wct plants. finally, the plants which displayed the higher sensitivity to acc treatment were hahb <dig> and wt, showing a very low percentage of seedlings without apical hook .

notably, h4-h <dig> plants were more sensitive to the acc treatment than hahb <dig> plants but not as sensitive as hahb <dig> plants, while h1wct plants decreased their sensitivity to the treatment. together these observations indicate that the ctr of hahb <dig> in h4-h <dig> seriously impairs the physiological response triggered by hahb <dig>  more effectively than the removal of its own ctr . in fact, h1wct could, to some extent, mimic the physiological response of hahb <dig> plants to acc, questioning the degree of participation of the ctr when hahb <dig> is involved in this pathway.

the phenotype of rosette-leaf serration was also tested. the number of serrations per leaf was calculated for high expression lines of each genotype: wt, hahb <dig> b, hahb <dig> b and h4-h <dig> a, b and c plants. the results showed that hahb <dig> b and h4-h <dig> b plants presented a clear increase in serration while the rest of the lines had a serration similar to that of wt plants . the quantifications were subjected to the kruskal-wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks and then the different lines were classified in groups according to pairwise comparisons with a p-value of  <dig>  . the results indicated that hahb <dig> and h4-h <dig> b had a statistically significant increase in serration. together with h1-h <dig> a, these three lines were distinguishable from hahb <dig> plants.

the sum of ranks of the kruskal-wallis test for each line is presented together with the groups resulting from the pair wise comparison. lines with statistically different behaviours do not share the same group.

discussion
transcription factors are modular proteins par excellence  <cit> . among the many types of modules present in different tfs, two are almost indispensable: a dna-binding domain and a protein-protein interaction domain which mediates activation or repression of transcription  <cit> . hd-zip proteins are transcription factors unique to plants and since the isolation of the first member in  <dig>  <cit> , several works have informed that the protein-dna interaction mediated by the hd is highly specific and needs as a prerequisite the dimerization of the tf through the halz  <cit> . other domains outside the hd and halz are present in members from hd-zip subfamilies iii and iv . hd-zip ii tfs have a redox motif in their ctrs  <cit>  and a ziebel motif in their ntrs  <cit> . in the case of hd-zip i proteins, no additional domains or motifs have been described for the whole group. some reports suggested the presence of a nuclear localization sequence in their amino terminus  <cit> ; however, no definite experimental evidence in this sense has been presented thus far. a few reports have provided evidence indicating a function for the ctr of these proteins. in this sense, activation activity was demonstrated as dependent on the ctr of athb <dig> in yeast  <cit> . additional support to the importance of the ctr was provided by sakuma et al.  <cit> ; they identified that the recessive allele vrs <dig>  which causes the six-rowed phenotype in barley, encodes an hd-zip i tf  <dig> residues shorter in the ctr than its paralogous gene hvhox <dig> , which was caused by a 300-bp insertion that introduced a stop codon. these authors identified a conserved motif within these  <dig> amino acids and suggested that this motif could interact with certain classes of co-activators in order to exert its biological function  <cit> .

recently, a pea deletion mutant in one hd-zip protein, in which tendrils were converted into leaflets , was shown to exhibit the same phenotype as a mutant in which the  <dig> amino acids of its ctr were not translated  <cit> .

the starting point of our analysis was a  <dig> hd-zip i protein dataset retrieved from cdart ncbi's database and that generated by mukherjee et al.  <cit> . the first step involved the construction of three phylogenetic trees: the hzt with the hd and halz domains, the hzt + og in which three hd-zip ii proteins were added as outgroup, and the cst with the complete sequences. the hd-zip ii tfs formed a clade which relative position was used to root the  <dig> threes. the hzt was considered the reference tree as its construction only used the sites homologous to all proteins. with the objective of identifying relevant functional regions outside the hd and halz domains, the sequence alignments of the ntrs and ctrs were inspected and the clades formed in the hzt and cst were compared. based on these observations, six groups were identified . the evident similarity in their ctrs, shared by most members of each group , strongly suggests the common ancestry of these proteins. this observation was statistically weakly supported for groups ic, ii, iii and iv in the hzt; but was significantly supported by bootstrap values in the cst . this suggests that the sequence of the hd and halz may not be sufficiently informative to clearly resolve some clades, thus the construction of a tree with the complete sequences proved to be a valuable strategy to identify and provide additional support to the hypothesis of relationship among the proteins in the different groups. nonetheless, as the cst was constructed considering sites which are homologous only to subgroups of proteins, the phylogenetic reconstruction lays over a partially unfulfilled hypothesis of homology and the tree was not taken as the reference reconstruction. none of the six groups identified included proteins from species of non-flowering plants; they included only proteins from monocots and dicots . this suggests that a common ancestor of the genes encoding these proteins existed prior to the split of monocots and dicots, but no clear homologues could be found in the analyzed proteins from more basal species.

the  <dig> proteins from physcomitrella patens formed a separate clade. this is potentially due to the low diversification of subfamily i hd-zip tfs in this non-vascular plant. rooting positioned this group as a non-basal group within clades of mostly flowering plant proteins. if the hypothesis of multiple gene losses in this species is considered unlikely, this presents incongruence with the known species phylogeny. this observation together with the relatively poor statistical support in the basal part of the tree  suggests that the precise relationship among groups could not be fully resolved. more sequences or a more complex approach might be needed to achieve it.

in the phylogeny of arabidopsis hd-zip i proteins obtained by henriksson et al.  <cit>  a classification in six classes was made. proteins from class α  were included in group v, three proteins from class β  were included in group ii while athb <dig> fell in group iii, proteins from class γ  were contained by group ic, and proteins from class δ  were included in group vi. none of the six groups included proteins from classes ε  and φ , moreover, the monophyly of class φ in relation to other arabidopsis proteins is not preserved in the hzt . although the reconstruction of henriksson et al.  <cit>  is supported by additional information, , it should be noted that classes ε and φ are the only for which no support from duplication history was found by the authors. it should also be mentioned that athb <dig> is a very atypical hd-zip i protein with an extremely long ctr  in which a rna recognition motif can be identified.

as mentioned before, hd-zip i proteins tested in vitro bind specifically and with high affinity the same pseudopalindromic sequence caatattg  <cit> . the alignment of the hd and halz of the proteins in the studied dataset showed a high degree of conservation for the residues responsible for sequence binding specificity  <cit> . consequently, the putative ability of targeting and regulating different groups of genes may be significantly determined by other protein features outside the hd.

numerous studies demonstrated that the expression of hd-zip i proteins under the control of the camv 35s promoter  <cit>  results in plants with diverse phenotypes. but considering that their dna-binding specificity could be a minor source of functional variability, conclusion supported by our in silico analysis of the  <dig> protein dataset; the importance of the role of the poorly characterized ntrs and ctrs in the function of hd-zip i tfs could have been overlooked. the sequence conservation found in these domains and the identification of different groups of tfs are in agreement with this notion.

in order to gain insight into the function of the conserved regions, a motif discovery strategy was carried out. as a result of running the program meme on the ntrs and ctrs,  <dig> and  <dig> motifs were obtained, respectively. many motifs were group specific/characteristic  but a few were more widely distributed. in general, the ctrs displayed more correlation between groups and motifs, although in this analysis no specific motifs were found in the ctr for group vi and the only motif present in subgroup ib  was also in subgroup ic . the motifs in the ntrs were only specific for groups ii , vi , v and pp. groups iii and iv shared motifs in the ntr and subgroups ia, ib and ic had no characteristic motifs in this region.

based on motif distribution within each ctr, the domain was divided in two regions: proximal and distal. in the distal region, motifs had up to three trp occupying positions with high frequency , particularly those corresponding to the last residues of the protein. in some motifs the same occurred with phe  and pro . another characteristic of the motifs in the distal region was the high abundance of acidic amino acids. these characteristics strongly resemble those of aha activator motifs  of the type found in hsfs proteins  <cit>  and other transcriptional activators  <cit> . mutational analysis in aha motifs from hsfs has proven that importance of aromatic and large hydrophobic residues in the core positions of this motif, which for these proteins were generally trp and phe. the role of aha motifs in the interaction with proteins from the basal transcription machinery  has also been demonstrated  <cit> . the presence of these motifs in most hd-zip i proteins constitutes an important finding for different reasons. firstly, it provides solid evidence that most tfs from this subfamily act as transcriptional activators, as has been demonstrated experimentally for some proteins previously  <cit> . secondly, it allows the location of the specific region within the ctr, the distal region, which is acting as an activation domain. good examples of the importance of this regions are vrs <dig>  <cit> , which lacks a motif in the ctr in relation to hvhox <dig>  and the protein without the last  <dig> residues of the ctr that mimics the tl mutation  <cit> ; in both cases the deletions correspond to aha-like sequences. finally, the different versions of aha motifs found, shared by the members of each group, may be responsible for the interaction with different co-activators or members of the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> , and thus provide a source of functional divergence among hd-zip i proteins together with differential expression patterns in some cases.

in the proximal region of the ctr, many motifs were characterized by the presence of ser and acidic amino acids occupying most of the high-frequency positions. many of the ser in these motifs  were predicted as putative phosphorylation sites. particularly interesting was the case of the widespread motif  <dig> in proteins from groups iii, iv, v and pp, always in the proximal region. this may be important as it has been previously demonstrated in vitro  <cit>  that the phosphorylation of athb <dig> with the pka kinase inhibits its dna-binding activity.

putative sumoylation sites were also investigated in the ctr. the peptide to which sumo is conjugated, Ψkxe/d, was mainly present in motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which were identified in groups ic, ii, v and pp. a more exhaustive exploration revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> ctrs had this motif, which appeared  <dig> times. the acidic amino acid was in most cases glu  and the hidrophobic residue, val .

the ntr presented  <dig> motifs and the correlation with putative phosphorylation sites was also analyzed. some potential residues for this post-translational modification were found in motifs  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  in relation to the motif  <dig> specific to group vi, six of its  <dig> members were predicted to have a nls within this motif characterized by a patch of basic residues. this result may be extended to the other members of the group as they share the same motif. sumoylation was also analyzed in the ntr but only eight sites were found, too few to consider it a significant general modification in hd-zip i ntrs.

proteins in the pp group shared motifs in the ntr and ctr which supports the hypothesis that there has been little diversification of hd-zip i tfs in this species. this is probably related to the simpler tissue organisation of mosses. there may be also a high tendency to heterodimerize and high functional redundancy among members. further analysis would be necessary to address these observations.

the functionality of the ctr was also tested experimentally. athb <dig> was selected as a characteristic member of group iii showing a typical aha motif. it was previously demonstrated that this tf presents transactivation activity in plant protoplasts  <cit> . a yeast one-hybrid experiment was performed with the whole protein, the ctr alone, and a truncated version in which the ctr was removed. as predicted, the removal of the ctr containing the aha motif generated a mutant protein which lost the ability to transactivate in this system, while the ctr alone was capable of transactivating when fused to gal4-bd .

in our laboratory, two sunflower hd-zip i tfs have been extensively studied, hahb <dig> and hahb <dig> . both bind in vitro the pseudopalindromic sequence caatattg, and both have been expressed in arabidopsis under the control of the 35s camv promoter. the resulting plants exhibited clearly different phenotypes. phylogenetically, hahb <dig> is a member of group v whereas hahb <dig> is in group i, but not included in any subgroup. hahb <dig> ntr and ctr have most of the motifs present in other members of its group, but no particular motifs were detected in hahb <dig> ntr or ctr, nevertheless, it has two trp at the c-terminus, but with an abnormal basic residue close to them. in addition to the constructs of hahb <dig> and hahb <dig> complete coding sequences, three constructs were prepared and arabidopsis transgenic plants transformed: a version of hahb <dig> without the ctr , an analogous protein where the ctr of hahb <dig> was deleted , and a chimerical protein bearing the ntr, hd and halz of hahb <dig> fused to the ctr of hahb <dig> . the promoter was also the 35s camv. the phenotypic differences between the plants were assessed in a triple response experiment in which hook formation in plants grown in acc was measured as an indicator of ethylene sensitivity. the results confirmed previous observations: hahb <dig> plants were highly insensitive and hahb <dig> plants had a normal response. among the mutant proteins, h4wct displayed the higher insensitivity while h1wct and h4-h <dig> showed an intermediate response. the deletion of hahb <dig> ctr in h1wct was enough to confer an intermediate insensibility to the transgenic plants, in contrast with the responsiveness displayed by hahb <dig> plants. in the case of h4wct, the insensitivity is not completely reverted by the deletion of the ctr. h4-h <dig> plants showed some impairment in ethylene response, which puts in evidence that the exchange in ctrs has an impact on the phenotype, at least for hahb <dig> ctr which has no motifs in common. despite these observations, the fact that both mutant proteins lacking the ctr  exhibit an altered sensitivity to ethylene may suggest that hahb <dig> ctr could be non-essential for its activity in this pathway. moreover, the sole removal of the ctr of hahb <dig> produces a protein that does not develop the same response as hahb <dig> in transgenic plants, stressing the importance of the ctr in this protein.

when leaf serration was evaluated it was shown that the fusion of hahb <dig> ctr with hahb <dig> hd-zip was capable of generating the increase serration phenotype in one of the transgenic lines, as was observed for hahb <dig> plants. the results obtained with the construction h4-h <dig> were not conclusive; a possibility is that both domains, the ntr and the ctr, may be important to generate a protein functionally similar to hahb <dig> 

wenkel et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that small leucine zipper-containing proteins were responsible for the inhibition of hd-zip iii proteins by heterodimerization. it is tempting to hypothesise that the capability of h1wct of mimicking hahb <dig> and h4wct insensitivity to ethylene is the product of an inhibitory mechanism important in this pathway, especially considering that hahb <dig> has an atypical aha motif with a basic amino acid. in this scenario, the native hahb <dig> protein would be more efficient than the mutant proteins h4wct and h1wct in exerting this inhibitory activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the analyses of a set of  <dig> hd-zip i proteins allowed the identification of six groups, in most cases with high sequence conservation outside the hd and halz. an exhaustive exploration of these regions revealed an aha motif in the ctr of most proteins that could be performing the activation role at a molecular level, like in hsfs tfs; and possibly giving some specificity to the interactions with the basal transcription machinery. putative phosphorylation sites were found in the ntrs and ctrs, potential sumoylation motifs were discovered in the ctr, and nlss found in the ntr for the members of one group. altogether, this data allows us to postulate an enriched model of hd-zip i functional domains or regions .

the presence of shared motifs in nearly all hd-zip i proteins of the moss physcomitrella patens, a much simple organism than higher plants, points to an ancestral low functional diversification of these proteins, beyond the numerous genes present in its genome. in more complex plants, like monocots and dicots, a discrete and probably incomplete number of groups has been identified. at a functional and evolutionary level, the potential significance of this division in groups represents an interesting topic for further research.
