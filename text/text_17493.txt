BACKGROUND
a mitochondrion has double-stranded circular dna, which encodes  <dig> genes essential for normal cell functions such as cellular energy metabolism, free radical generation, and apoptosis . due to its high mutation rate and only rudimentary dna repair capabilities  <cit> , mtdna sequences vary among individuals, organs, and tissues  <cit> . furthermore, de-novo mtdna mutations can accumulate over the lifetime of the individual and result in progressive deterioration of mitochondrial function . given that there are 2– <dig> copies of mtdna per mitochondrion and up to  <dig> mitochondria per cell  <cit> , mutations in mtdna are generally heteroplasmic, with copies of both wild-type and mutant mtdna in each cell  <cit> . low-level heteroplasmy, mitochondrial dna mutations with minor allele frequency ≤ 1%, is associated with aging  <cit> , cancer  <cit> , and neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer’s  <cit>  and parkinson’s disease  <cit> .

most of the techniques traditionally used to detect heteroplasmy such as sanger capillary sequencing  <cit> , high-performance liquid chromatography  <cit> , snapshot  <cit> , high-resolution melt profiling  <cit> , temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis  <cit> , invader assay  <cit> , and surveyor nuclease digestion  <cit>  require the candidate positions to be pre-defined and do not allow determination of de-novo heteroplasmic locations. high throughput sequencing  technology allows detection of heteroplasmy across multiple locations in the mitochondrial genome simultaneously, making it the technology of choice in recent studies .

however, the ability of this technology to detect heteroplasmy, especially low-abundance mutations, has its limitations. while some studies suggest that false positive rare variants can be artifacts of the sequencing technology  <cit>  and mapping algorithms  , many publications have also focused on the interference of nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin  on the detection of rare variants . these studies generally consider variants with abundance below 2% potentially false positive and exclude them. the landmark work by li et al.  <cit>  for example, used a large number of already identified numts to estimate the accuracy of low-level heteroplasmy calls and distinguish them from sequencing errors. this approach, however, relies on the reference database of numts used in the analysis.

it is important to emphasize that while using only numts to identify possible locations in the mitochondrial genome where ndna can cause false positive heteroplasmy makes the computational task relatively easy, the search for numts in human nuclear genomes is not yet over. long and highly similar sequences shared between nuclear and mitochondrial dna, also called high fidelity numts are well described  <cit> . the search for new numts focused on shorter and less similar subsequences continues  <cit> . the results  however, vary depending on the sequence similarity threshold, alignment length, and types of search algorithms used in the analysis  <cit> .

to date, the use of paired end sequencing reads is believed to be the best way to avoid ndna interference by making sure that both reads are mapped to the mitochondrial genome with appropriate distance between them. this assumption, however, does not take into consideration that at least  <dig> known numts are longer that  <dig> bases   <cit> . these numts are able to produce reads pairs that may mistakenly be attributed as originating from mtdna.

an alternative approach to minimize the effects of unknown  numts is including a “nuclear dna exclusion” step into the heteroplasmy detection workflow. the basic idea of this method is to map all sequencing reads to the ndna and completely exclude them from the analysis  <cit> . this approach is computationally expensive: sequencing reads from each experiment have to be mapped to approximately three gigabases long human nuclear genome. additionally, the outcome of this approach will be significantly affected by the presence of short  and very similar regions shared between mtdna and ndna sequences including, but not limited to known numts. the longest shared  subsequence between ndna and mtdna is  <dig> bases  and at position  <dig>  in chromosome 1). allowing just one mismatch, the same region of chromosome  <dig> extends to  <dig> bases . the main disadvantage of the “nuclear dna exclusion” approach is its exclusion of sequencing reads originating from such regions from consideration. this step artificially reduces coverage of the corresponding mtdna regions and may result in false negative  outcomes.

to eliminate challenges of both approaches  we propose to pre-compute the locations of all subsequences in the mitochondrial genome shared perfectly  and approximately  between ndna and mtdna. this information allows to  avoid the nuclear dna exclusion step so the reads only need to be mapped to the much smaller mitochondrial genome;  exclude ambiguous  reads; and  eliminate discrepancies due to the incompleteness and subjectivity in the choice of numts data used in the analysis.

RESULTS
interference maps
exhaustive comparisons of all dna subsequences present in the human nuclear and reference mitochondrial genomes resulted in the creation of two nuclear interference maps for the mitochondrial genome: the exact match map and the approximate match map . the exact match map assigns to each position in the mitochondrial genome the length of the longest common subsequence : the longest subsequence, which includes given position in the mitochondrial genome and present simultaneously  in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. the approximate match map assigns to each position in the mitochondrial genome the length of the longest similar subsequence : the longest subsequence, which includes given position in the mitochondrial genome and present simultaneously  in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.fig.  <dig> the nucleotide-by-nucleotide perfect and approximate match ndna interference maps for the mitochondrial genome. 8f, 8r, 10f, and 10r are locations of long-range pcr primers used in li et al. study  <cit> . “maximum”  represents the length of the longest identified lcs  or lss  that covers an individual nucleotide position in mtdna. “average”  represents the average length of the identified lcs or lss that covers an individual nucleotide position in mtdna




as expected, due to the presence of numts and other regions containing subsequences similar to the mitochondrial genome, some common/similar subsequences between mitochondrial and nuclear dna appear to be quite long: longest lcs and lss among all locations in the mitochondrial genome are  <dig> and  <dig> bases in length, respectively. performed calculations  revealed the presence of long lcs and lss in highly studied genes such as nd <dig> , cox <dig> , mt-cox <dig> , atp <dig> , as well as atp <dig> . this observation suggested that in order to avoid ndna interference in every location in these genes, single end reads used in sequencing experiment have to be longer that  <dig> bases: the maximal length of lss. in contrast, longest and average lcs and lss in cytb , nd <dig> , and nd4l  genes appeared much shorter, all ndna interference in these genes can be avoided by using single end reads as short as  <dig> bases. in fact, the frequency distribution of the lss across the mitochondrial genome suggests that for approximately  <dig> % using only  <dig> bases long single end reads will be enough to avoid the ndna interference . this opens the opportunity to extend analysis of low-abundance variation in mitochondrial population to large data collections such as ncbi sequence read archive  <cit> , european nucleotide archive  <cit> , the cancer genome atlas  <cit> , and international cancer genome consortium  <cit>  which were by no means designed to explore the low-level heteroplasmy in mitochondrial genome.table  <dig> longest common and longest similar subsequences in mitochondrial genes

surprisingly, we observed more than a 25-fold difference in the length of both lcs and lss across different locations in the mitochondrial genome. the shortest lcs was only  <dig> bases long and appeared in two locations in the nd <dig> gene. the shortest lss was  <dig> bases long and appeared in two locations of the hypervariable d-loop region. as one can see in fig.  <dig>  the locations of the lcs and lss do not appear to be random and express a bias to particular regions of the mitochondrial genome. for example, the region located between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  in the mitochondrial genome contains the vast majority of long lcs and lss while the region between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  contains a high concentration of short lcs and lss. one possible explanation of these results can be that the introduction of mitochondrial sequences into the nuclear genome has a bias against certain locations in mtdna . another possibility is that some mtdna sequences have been introduced into nuclear dna over earlier periods of evolution and have accumulated more mutations than other sequences that have been more recently transferred from mtdna to ndna. the length distributions of lcs and lss that almost perfectly fit into a mixture of two and three poisson distributions  also suggested the involvement of several different mechanisms behind the origin/evolution of shared mtdna and ndna subsequences. these observations are also in agreement with recent work by tsuji et al.  <cit>  reporting the underrepresentation of d-loop sequences in ndna. performed analysis, however, pointed to several additional locations in the mitochondrial genome  exhibiting properties similar to d-loop sequences  suggesting that these regions could be mutated and/or underrepresented in ndna .fig.  <dig> poisson distributions. approximation of average length of lcs and lss covering each position in the mitochondrial genome by two  and three  mixed poisson distributions. the red dashed line represents the joint approximation of the mixed distributions




long range pcr primers
the noticeable presence of short subsequences unique to mtdna contradicts the common opinion that due to the numts, primers designed for mtdna amplification will always amplify  some amount of ndna. although this is true for the primers originally designed by meyer et al. for use in long-range amplification  <cit>  and employed in the li et al. studies  <cit>  , performed analysis suggests that each of these aforementioned primers is not unique to mtdna and has many similar sequences in ndna . furthermore, the analysis of the frequency distribution of the length of lcs and lss revealed that  <dig> and 72% of locations, respectively, in the mitochondrial genome are more specific than the locations chosen for these primers. in-silico pcr, using mfeprimer- <dig>   <cit>  against the human genome, shows that these primers can produce  <dig> amplicons from the human nuclear genome .table  <dig> characteristics of four long-range mtdna pcr primers used by li et al  <cit>  and four proposed high fidelity long-range primers

the best locations for highly specific pcr primers would be positions where the lengths of the lss are at their minima. several such locations, which are highly specific for mtdna, are shown in fig.  <dig>  as an example, we tested four of such location and designed new long-range pcr primers  to amplify this region. in-silico pcr using these primers and a human genome target shows no viable ndna amplicons . an in-vivo validation using illumina miseq at 151 cycles followed by mapping to the mitochondrial genome  and the human genome  shows that the proposed primers allowed a 10% reduction in the proportion of reads mapped to the nuclear genome at 95% alignment identity . it is important to emphasize, however, that proposed primers are only an example of how the fidelity of long-range pcr can be improved. figure  <dig> shows several  possible locations for long-range pcr primers. testing all the mitochondria-specific locations could lead to further improvement of the mtdna enrichment protocol but it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

it is important to emphasize the limitations of the presented interference maps. the latest human genome build  used in the analysis is missing some sequences from highly repetitious regions, especially centromeres. additionally, personal genomic variations  and possible variations in numts between individuals were not included in our computations. more robust interference maps can be built using a higher number of mismatches. for these reasons, the presented interference maps only allow the identification of the minimum required sequencing read length in mitochondrial regions of interest and establishes a confidence level in the analysis results.

CONCLUSIONS
due to high throughput and rapidly decreasing cost, hts offers new opportunities to identify mitochondrial heteroplasmy including low-level heteroplasmy. the presence of a significant amount of ndna, however, can introduce bias and cause false positive low-level heteroplasmy calls. this is especially important for in-solution capturing techniques, which have become more popular for mitochondrial heteroplasmy analysis over the last few years .

to avoid interference from ndna at each given location, the length of the lss at that location must be longer than the length of the sequencing reads. proposed maps allow to predict the level of possible ndna interference for each location in the mitochondrial genome, improve the fidelity of rare variant identification, and guide the choice of the sequencing read length. performed analysis suggests that heteroplasmy  can be identified using short  single end read for the significant part of the mitochondrial genome, which opens an opportunity to employ the data from a variety of existing collections such as the sequence read archive and the cancer genome atlas into the analysis.

identified locations of short lcs and lss in the mitochondrial genome can also be used to improve the quality of long-range pcr primers and probes for in-solution mtdna capture by eliminating binding to the nuclear genome. the locations and length distributions of lcs and lss support the hypothesis of non-random mtdna introduction into human nuclear dna and suggest that several regions of the mitochondrial genome  may be underrepresented or mutated after being introduced into ndna.
