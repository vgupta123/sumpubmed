BACKGROUND
images of colonial corals illuminated by sunlight are dominant in the literature, in part because the majority of hermatypic coral species are found in the top  <dig> m of the photic zone  <cit> . this distribution reflects their reliance on sunlight to support their photosynthetic symbiotic dinoflagellates, partners that reside within the gastrodermal cells of all hermatypic corals. these dinoflagellates  enhance calcification  <cit>  and translocate fixed carbon to the host where it is respired, and provides the majority of the metabolic needs of the host  <cit> . this intimate symbiosis between corals and dinoflagellates underpins the ecological success of corals in the nutrient poor environments of tropical and subtropical marine ecosystems  <cit> .

despite the general public perception that zooxanthellate scleractinian corals are confined to shallow well-lit waters, they exist throughout the entire euphotic zone, from full sunlight to virtual darkness  <cit> . zooxanthellate corals have been recorded as deep as  <dig> m in the pacific . in hawaii, the hermatypic coral genus leptoseris  is present at shallower depths, but deep water surveys found leptoseris dominates the mesophotic zone  <cit> , where it is apparently able to photosynthesize at light levels as low as 1% of the surface light intensity  <cit> . previous deep water surveys reported three dominant leptoseris species from hawaii, l. hawaiiensis, l. yabei , and an undescribed congeneric species, and highlighted the need for more research on these mesophotic corals, particularly their systematics  <cit> .

what underlies this extraordinary physiological range and depth distribution of leptoseris corals is unknown, but it is likely that attributes and adaptations in both the endosymbiotic community and coral host are involved  <cit> . examining this symbiotic association at the limits of the photic zone may help us understand the interactions by which reef corals cope with and adjust to extremes in the environment. to begin to unravel the traits that allow leptoseris spp. to exploit deep habitats, this study uses molecular genetic techniques to examine the interaction between endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus symbiodinium and mesophotic corals in the genus leptoseris. because of the difficulties inherent in collecting samples below traditional scuba depths, this study represents one of the first to examine the genetics of coral-algal associations at depths below  <dig> m in hawaii.

under different light regimes, coral hosts and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates maintain high rates of photosynthetic carbon translocation by photoacclimation. this is achieved in some corals and their endosymbionts by changes in the cellular concentrations of photosynthetic pigment  <cit> . however, some symbiotic organisms  show minimal changes in the photosynthetic pigments of their endosymbionts with changes in light. these differences in physiological flexibility may reflect taxonomic differences in the composition or identity of the endosymbiotic dinoflagellate communities in the different coral species  <cit> . although it was initially believed that all corals hosted a single species of dinoflagellate , molecular genetics have demonstrated that the genus symbiodinium is extremely diverse and a single coral can host multiple, co-occurring endosymbiotic strains  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of the genus symbiodinium, based primarily on nuclear ribosomal genes, have led to the current recognition of eight major lineages or clades   <cit>  that are each partitioned further into sub-cladal types, most frequently using the quickly evolving internal transcribed spacer regions of the ribosomal dna operon  <cit> .

to date, several patterns have been detected in the distribution of symbiodinium taxa with depth , suggesting that light tolerance in symbiodinium may drive the distributions of host coral colonies  <cit> . irradiance could therefore be an important determinant in the distribution of symbiodinium, with different symbiodinium genotypes dominating the light environments for which their photosynthetic characteristics are best adapted  <cit> .

characterizing the symbiodinium communities found in mesophotic corals such as leptoseris spp. is an obvious first step in exploring how these corals are able to survive and thrive at such depths. given the unique environmental characteristics and extremely low light levels in the mesophotic zone, we hypothesized that leptoseris spp. from the deep mesophotic  would host highly specialized and unique symbiodinium types found only at these depths.

RESULTS
six symbiodinium genotypes were recovered and analyzed from  <dig> deep  leptoseris spp. samples. all were phylogenetically identified as belonging to clade c. four of the sequences have been previously published  and two were novel and differed from known sequences by one or two base pairs . these sequences were named c1_v1a and c1_v1b, because they differed from type c <dig> by one and two bp, respectively. c <dig> includes a seven bp indel, one bp indel, and three polymorphic sites .

the  <dig> leptoseris samples grouped as six mitochondrial nad <dig> haplotypes, identified by seven polymorphic sites and named n1-n <dig> .

the association between symbiodinium type and host mitochondrial haplotype was not random . leptoseris corals with haplotypes n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig>  and n <dig>  hosted endosymbiont communities dominated by symbiodinium types c <dig> and c1c . leptoseris corals with haplotype n <dig>  had more diverse symbiodinium communities, harboring c <dig>  c1c, c1_v1a and c1_v1b. n <dig> was the only coral haplotype to associate with symbiodinium types c1_v1a and c1_v1b, which always co-occurred in a sample. leptoseris haplotype n <dig>  was the only sampled coral that hosted symbiodinium type c <dig> . it is important to note here that symbiodinium type c <dig> always co-occurred with either one or a combination of the types c1c, c1b, c1_v1a and c1_v1b. because intragenomic variation at the its- <dig> locus is high in symbiodinium  <cit> , one explanation would be that these co-occurring types represent intragenomic variants within the same symbiont genome rather than distinct genomes.

discussion
leptoseris corals are some of the deepest-dwelling zooxanthellate corals in the world  <cit>  and the biological attributes that underpin the ability of this genus to thrive across such a large depth range  are central to our understanding of limits of the coral-endosymbiont interaction. intracellular photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts of the genus symbiodinium are pivotal to the success of corals as a group and are known to be taxonomically and physiologically diverse  <cit> . we thus hypothesized that the symbiodinium communities hosted by leptoseris spp. in the mesophotic zone might be highly specialized to this environment and that this would be apparent as a pattern in the distribution of symbiodinium types hosted by leptoseris spp. over a depth gradient. surprisingly, our data do not support this hypothesis; leptoseris spp. sampled at  <dig> m and deeper, host symbiodinium types commonly found in shallow-water corals across the pacific  <cit> . although endosymbiont diversity will vary by host species, this finding contradicts studies examining endosymbiont diversity in corals sampled across shallower depth gradients  that observed partitioning of symbiodinium communities at the level of clade  <cit>  and its <dig> types  <cit>  by depth, and therefore, evidence for depth-based ecological function in symbionts. we found symbiodinium its <dig> types c <dig> and c1c in mesophotic zooxanthellate corals. its <dig> type c <dig> has also been found in two leptoseris incrustans colonies sampled in hawaii between 10- <dig> m depth  <cit> . the generalist c <dig> symbiodinium types are widely distributed both geographically and environmentally  <cit> .

solar radiation is a major determinant of photosynthesis, and therefore influences the amount of carbon translocated to the host, and the phototrophic contribution to the animal  <cit> . when light declines with depth, without photoacclimation, carbon fixation rates and the amount of translocated carbon declines  <cit> . leptoseris fragilis in the red sea exhibit large changes in photosynthetic pigment concentrations with changes in depth  <cit> . our results from leptoseris spp. in hawaii suggest that this may be a capacity of generalist symbiodinium types such as c <dig> and c1c. however, confirming whether these abundant, generalist types have the ability to photoacclimate across the depth range under consideration here will require pigment studies and endosymbiont density counts and will be an important component of future research on the deep water corals in hawaii.

despite the focus on symbiodinium and its ability to photoacclimate, the coral host can also influence photoacclimation. research on leptoseris fragilis in the red sea has shown possible photoadaptations in host light-harvesting systems that may enhance photosynthetic performance  <cit> . these include fluorescent pigments that may convert light at depth to wavelengths useable for photosynthesis  <cit> , plate-like growth forms, and morphological adaptations like conical knobs that may serve as coral "light traps"  <cit> . leptoseris in hawaii also possess these three adaptations, but their influence on photosynthetic performance in leptoseris spp. in hawaii has yet to be directly demonstrated.

furthermore, leptoseris could differ from shallow corals in its reliance on phototrophic carbon because this coral could obtain more nutrients from feeding  <cit> , or have reduced needs for nutrients with slower growth rates and lower metabolism  <cit> . for example, l. fragilis has trophic adaptations that may be responsible for minimizing their dependence on photosynthetically fixed carbon  <cit> . l. fragilis has a perforated gastrovascular cavity, resulting in a flow-through system where microscopic particulate organic material such as detritus, bacteria, and plankton can accumulate  <cit> . as light decreases with depth, greater reliance on feeding heterotrophically  may enable these corals to survive. however, to date, no studies have examined the relative contribution of photosynthetically fixed carbon to the daily energy budget of corals at these depths in hawaii; such studies are critical to a more comprehensive understanding of leptoseris's spp. broad depth distribution.

given the known slow rate of evolution in coral mitochondrial dna  <cit> , the six distinct coral haplotypes we found likely represent multiple species and highlight unrecognized diversity in this coral genus. in a previous study using the nad <dig> marker, concepcion et al.  <cit>  found no variation between species within the genus acropora and pocillopora, but for the genus porites, p. asteroides and p. compressa differed by two indels, and p. porites and p. compressa by four single bp changes.

interestingly, we found different symbiodinium communities associated with different mitochondrial nad <dig> haplotypes. four of the coral mitochondrial types  were dominated by c <dig> and c1c endosymbionts, however, n <dig>  and n <dig>  showed different patterns of symbiont association .

CONCLUSIONS
this study was a natural first step to exploring the biological traits that allow leptoseris spp. to persist and dominate at mesophotic depths . we found common shallow-water symbiodinium types at depths not previously recorded for these endosymbionts. we also found genetic variability at mitochondrial nad <dig>  which suggests undescribed taxonomic diversity in leptoseris. mesophotic coral communities are found beyond the limits of traditional scuba diving and as a result, their ecology is poorly understood  <cit> . an understanding of the mechanism by which reef corals adjust to extremes in the environment and the limits inherent to these mechanisms provides insights into the future responses of deep and shallow reef communities to environmental change. our study indicates that a specialist symbiont is not a prerequisite for existence at environmental extremes.
