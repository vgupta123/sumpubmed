BACKGROUND
sesame , belonging to the pedaliaceae genus, is an ancient oilseed crop, considered important for its high quality seed oil  <cit> . sesame is cultivated mainly in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia and africa, with a total area of  <dig>  million hectares worldwide and an annual production of  <dig>  million tons . in china, one of the main long-term hindrances in sesame production is the lack of varieties with high disease resistance and water-logging tolerance. genetic diversity among cultivars is relatively low since all varieties are derived from the one cultivated sesame species, sesamum indicum l. the low level of polymorphism in sesame has been demonstrated using universal markers such as random amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> , inter-simple sequence repeats   <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  and sequence-related amplified polymorphisms   <cit> , and species-specific markers such as simple sequence repeats   <cit>  and expressed sequence tags-ssr   <cit> . inadequate information on sesame resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and sesame growth and developmental processes has created a breeding bottleneck which is unlikely to be solved in the near future.

since massive-scale cloning and sequencing of dna or est libraries has been relatively high-cost, low throughput and time-consuming, the development of ssr markers has been slow, making it more difficult to construct a detailed genetic linkage map that can be used in sesame genetics breeding programs. at present, including a recently published set of  <dig> sesame ssr markers derived from a transcriptome study  <cit> , less than  <dig> polymorphic ssr and est-ssr markers are available. at present, only eight est-ssr markers are anchored in the first and only sesame genetic map  <cit> .

recent advances in large-scale rna-seq provide a fast, cost-effective, and reliable approach for the generation of large expression datasets in non-model species  <cit> , and also offer an opportunity to identify and develop ssrs using data mining with bioinformatic tools. compared with genomic ssr markers, these new genic-ssr markers may help to identify candidate functional genes and increase the efficiency of marker-assisted selection  <cit> . we therefore performed sesame rna-seq to further our understanding of the sesame transcriptome and to develop large numbers of novel and efficient genic-ssr molecular markers. here, we analyze the frequency and distribution of genic-ssrs in the sesame rna-seq transcriptome, and validate  <dig> of our  <dig>  ssr markers in  <dig> cultivated accessions, one wild species and one f <dig> mapping population. our set of ssr markers will provide a useful tool for sesame genetic research and comparative genome analysis.

RESULTS
uni-transcript sequences obtained with illumina sequencing
we obtained more than  <dig> million 75 bp or 100 bp paired-end filtered reads from  <dig> sesame samples using high-throughput paired-end rna-seq. the total length of the reads was over  <dig>  gbp. reads were subsequently de novo assembled into  <dig>  contigs with a length of over 100 bp, and then further assembled into  <dig>  uni-scaffolds with a mean size of  <dig>  bp using paired-end joining and tgi clustering tools .

mining of genic-ssrs
the  <dig>  uni-transcript sequences covered  <dig>  kbp of the sesame genome, and a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   ssrs, present in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the uni-transcripts respectively, were identified in the data.

types and frequencies of genic-ssrs
we divided the ssrs into three groups according to the repeat motif classification criteria proposed by weber  <cit> , i.e., perfect, imperfect and compound types . most repeats  were perfect repeats. of these, di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant motif type.

in the imperfect and compound ssr categories, only mono-, di- and tri-nucleotide ssr units were present. all repeat motifs in mono-nucleotide ssr units were of the a/t type. ag/ct, ca/tg and at/at repeat motif types were present in di-nucleotide ssr units, while only gaa/ttc repeat motifs were found in tri-nucleotide ssr units. of the six types of ssr units, mono-mono, di-di-, tri-tri-, mono-di-, mono-tri- and di-tri-nucleotide types were found in both perfect and imperfect compound ssr categories. the di-di-nucleotide type was the most abundant, representing more than 80% of all ssrs.

distribution of repeat motif types
we noted that the proportion of six different ssr unit sizes was not evenly distributed among perfect ssr groups. different repeat units occurred at frequencies of:  <dig> % and  <dig> %   <dig> % and  <dig> % ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % , and  <dig> % and  <dig> % , for ssrs ≥15 bp and ≥18 bp, respectively .

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> types of repeat motifs were identified among the  <dig>   and  <dig>   perfect ssrs . the n mono-nucleotide repeat motif was the most abundant in both datasets. the five other main unit types were the n di-nucleotide, n tri-nucleotide, n tetra-nucleotide, n penta-nucleotide and n hexa-nucleotide repeat motifs, and occurred at frequencies of  <dig> % and 100%,  <dig> % and  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and  <dig> %, in ssrs ≥15 bp and ssrs ≥18 bp, respectively. furthermore, it was observed that the g/c repeat motif type was only present in mono-nucleotide ssr units in ssrs ≥15 bp; and the gc/gc repeat motif type was not observed in di-nucleotide ssr units in either ssrs ≥15 bp or ssrs ≥18 bp.

of the perfect motif types, the n di-nucleotides were the most abundant ; ssrs ≥18 bp,  <dig>  ), followed by n di-nucleotides  and  <dig> ), n di-nucleotides  and  <dig> ), and n tri-nucleotides  and  <dig> ).

further analysis indicated that the copy number of different repeat motifs in perfect ssrs sequences was distributed unevenly . the copy number of different repeat motifs varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with the n di-nucleotide repeats having the highest copy number. the four most frequent copy numbers for ssrs ≥15 bp were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , while  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were the most frequent copy numbers for ssrs ≥18 bp. the longest ssr length in each unit type  was 25 bp , 52 bp , 51 bp , 32 bp , 55 bp  and 48 bp .

data for ssrs ≥18 bp is given in brackets.

pcr amplification and polymorphism of genic-ssrs
using primer <dig>   <dig>  ssr primer pairs were detected in the  <dig>  ssr-containing sequences  and  <dig> ssr primer pairs were randomly selected and synthesized to validate their level of polymorphism . of these primer pairs,  <dig>  amplified non-specific products, and  <dig>  gave no products in any of the sesame accessions.  <dig>  primer pairs yielded amplification products in the  <dig> cultivars, of which  <dig>  exhibited polymorphisms. a total of  <dig> alleles were detected with these  <dig> primer pairs and the number of alleles ranged from 2– <dig> per genic-ssr marker, with a mean of  <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the hs <dig> ssr marker detected the maximum number of alleles .  <dig>  of the ssr primer pairs yielded pcr amplicons in the wild accession,  <dig>  of which were polymorphic between the wild accession and cultivated accessions.

phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> cultivated sesame accessions
in order to evaluate their ability to assess molecular diversity and their potential for use in fingerprinting analysis, we calculated the pic values of the above genic-ssr markers, based on the allelic variation exhibited by  <dig> polymorphic primer pairs in  <dig> cultivated accessions. pic values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and had an average value of  <dig>  , with primer hs <dig> giving the maximum pic value of  <dig> . phylogenetic relationships between the cultivars were assessed by constructing a upgma dendrogram using similarity coefficients . at a similarity coefficient ≥  <dig> , the largest subgroup consisted of  <dig> accessions, comprising  <dig> chinese-released cultivars,  <dig> chinese local sesame accessions and  <dig> exotic sesame accessions. the m <dig> accession  had the lowest similarity value of  <dig>  and was clustered into a distant subgroup. the next most distant cultivars were m <dig> and m <dig>  splitting into subgroups at similarity values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. our results indicate that geographic sources of the accessions in this study do not correspond well with the genetic distances between accessions and as a result the genetic relationships among exotic, local germplasm and cultivars are not clear.

genetic mapping
the analysis above indicated that  <dig> markers  were polymorphic between the parents of our mapping population . after screening the 96 f <dig> mapping population,  <dig> genic-ssr markers were distributed among  <dig> linkage groups .

discussion
in order to identify useful ssr markers and obtain transcriptomic information on disease resistance and developmental processes, we sequenced the transcriptomes of  <dig> sesame samples and identified  <dig>  genic-ssr primer pairs .

genic-ssr markers are considered to have strong potential for genetic analysis and linkage map construction in crop species due to their specificity and high degree of conservation  <cit> . although  <dig> est-ssrs have previously been developed from  <dig>  est sequences and utilized in sesame genetic diversity analysis and mapping  <cit> , polymorphic markers are few, and marker-assisted gene mapping for important sesame traits or biological processes such as disease resistance, sesame growth and development, and seed formation has thus not been widely implemented.

genic-ssr distribution
here, to accurately analyze the frequency of ssrs in the transcribed regions of the sesame genome, we compared the numbers and types of ssr motif sequences of ssrs ≥15 bp and ≥18 bp. a total of  <dig>    and  <dig>  ssrs   were identified in  <dig>  uni-transcript sequences, with an average of one ssr per  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. by the parameter of sequence length  per ssr marker, the distribution frequency of genic ssrs is both lower than that of previous est-ssrs developed from est sequences in sesame , one est-ssr per  <dig>  kb)  <cit> . this frequency of occurrence of sesame genic-ssrs  is relatively higher than in other crops, including wheat , rice , maize  and soybean   <cit> . furthermore, it has been emphasized that the frequency of ssrs is correlated with many factors, such as ssr detection criteria, dataset size, database-mining tools, different species and different materials  <cit> .

distribution of repeat motif types
of the perfect repeat motifs types, tri-nucleotide repeats have generally been observed to have the highest frequency in many crops, including cotton, barley, wheat, maize, sorghum, rice and peanut  <cit> . however, here, as in previous studies on sesame and some rosaceae species, the most abundant repeat motif type was the di-nucleotide  <cit> . hexa-nucleotide repeats were the second most abundant , followed by tri-nucleotides  in ssrs ≥18 bp. moreover, of the hundreds of types of repeat motifs, the n di-nucleotide motifs showed the highest frequency, in agreement with recent results in sesame and other species  <cit> . as in other dicot plants, such as arabidopsis <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and peanut  <cit> , but different from some cereal species  <cit> , the n motif was the most abundant of the tri-nucleotide repeat motifs. similar to wheat, sorghum and peanut  <cit> , the gc/gc repeat was not found in any of the perfect and imperfect ssr categories in sesame.

polymorphic nature of the genic-ssr markers
to determine the level of polymorphism among our set of new genic-ssr markers, we validated  <dig> primer pairs using  <dig> sesame accessions.  <dig>  successfully yielded pcr amplicons, in line with previously reported ratios of 60– <dig> % amplification  <cit> .  <dig>  of the genic-ssrs that yielded amplifiable products in cultivated sesame also produced pcr amplicons in a wild sesame species. the ratio of polymorphic ssr was similar to that for est-ssrs in other crops with a range of 40–89%  <cit> .

some reports indicated that the low polymorphism of ssr markers in sesame is likely due to its narrow genetic basis  <cit> . dixit et al.  found that only ten out of  <dig> ssr markers developed from a sesame dna library were polymorphic in  <dig> sesame accessions  <cit> . wei et al.  developed  <dig> est-ssr markers from the  <dig>  sesame ests published in ncbi, and found that only  <dig>  were polymorphic in the  <dig> sesame accessions tested   <cit> . in this study, a similar level of polymorphism was observed; only  <dig>  genic-ssr markers were polymorphic in  <dig> cultivars,  <dig>  were polymorphic in one mapping population, and  <dig>  were polymorphic between the  <dig> acessions and a wild sesame accession. furthermore, the level of polymorphism in sesame was also similar to other crops  <cit> . in wheat, no more than  <dig> % of primers exhibit polymorphisms between the parents of any individual mapping population, although  <dig> % of detected est-ssrs have been reported to exhibit polymorphisms in  <dig> alien species  <cit> . in peanut,  <dig>  est-ssrs exhibited polymorphisms between  <dig> cultivated peanut accessions and  <dig>  were polymorphic between  <dig> wild peanut species  <cit> .

our results indicate that large numbers of polymorphic ssr markers can be obtained when large volumes of transcript sequences or datasets are used, even though genetic diversity is restricted in sesame cultivars. compared with other ssr detection methods, the de novo rna sequencing approach used here is well-suited for mining and developing large numbers of genic-ssrs in sesame, and can rapidly enrich the numbers of functional markers available to use in marker-assisted gene selection and qtl analysis.

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> cultivated sesame accessions
our dendrogram, based on genetic similarity results, did not divide our sesame accessions into clear groupings. the distribution of these sesame accessions was not based on their geographical sources, in agreement with some previous reports  <cit> . the average pic value of genic-ssrs obtained here was  <dig> , similar to that obtained in our previous study  <cit> . most of the varieties released in china were clustered in the same subgroup in the dendrogram, suggesting the limited genetic diversity and narrow basis of chinese sesame cultivars. to enlarge the genetic basis, more exotic accessions should be used in future sesame breeding programs. one possibility would be to introduce gonder- <dig> , the outlying accession in our dendrogram, as a parent for sesame breeding or other genetic research.

utilization of genic-ssr markers in genetic mapping
we anchored  <dig> of our newly developed genic-ssr markers in the sesame genetic map , nearly twice the number of those anchored in recent sesame genetic map study  <cit> . using these newly designed genic-ssrs, the density of ssr markers in the sesame genetic map will greatly increase in the near future. in addition, putative functions of  <dig> of the  <dig> anchored genic-ssrs were identified with blastx. these genic-ssrs will be very valuable in studies of gene mapping, comparative genome analysis and marker-assisted selection.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig>  genic-ssr markers were identified from  <dig>  uni-scaffolds in a comprehensive transcriptome study.  <dig> of the  <dig> primer pairs chosen for validation successfully yielded pcr amplicons in  <dig> cultivated sesame accessions. this set of genic-ssr markers will be valuable for genetic research in sesame on aspects such as growth and development processes or biotic stress traits, since our transcriptome data was derived from different organs, developmental stages, and stress treatments.
