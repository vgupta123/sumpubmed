BACKGROUND
the increased understanding of molecular mechanisms driving tumorigenesis in a wide array of neoplasms has led to the development of novel targeted therapies. while tyrosine kinase inhibitors  are routinely employed in human oncology with success, their use in veterinary medicine is limited. two small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, toceranib  phosphate  and masitinib  have been approved by the fda for use in veterinary medicine for the treatment of recurrent, non-resectable intermediate and high grade canine cutaneous mast cell tumors   <cit> . the success of targeted therapies in both human and veterinary oncology, however, is largely tempered by the inevitable development of drug resistance.

cutaneous mcts are the most common skin tumors in dogs, accounting for up to 21% of all canine cutaneous tumors, and exhibit variable biologic behavior  <cit> . cutaneous mcts commonly present as a solitary mass in older dogs with a mean age of onset of 9 years old. there is no sex predilection. while all breeds can be affected, boxers, boston terriers, labrador retrievers, weimaraners, bulldogs, beagles, and schnauzers are over-represented  <cit> .

activating mutations in the juxtamembrane, kinase and ligand binding domains of the c-kit proto-oncogene have been associated with the tumorigenesis of canine mcts, resulting in growth factor-independent and constitutive phosphorylation of the kit receptor tyrosine kinase . approximately one-third of canine mcts carry a c-kit mutation and the majority of mcts with c-kit mutations are histologically intermediate or high grade  <cit> . while the majority of gain-of-function mutations of c-kit have been identified in exon  <dig> of canine mcts, exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and less commonly exon  <dig>  also acquire activating mutations  <cit> . our laboratory and others have shown that c-kit mutations, particularly internal tandem duplications  in the juxtamembrane domain, are significantly associated with an increased incidence of recurrent disease, metastasis, and death  <cit> . as such, small molecule inhibitors of kit are an attractive therapeutic strategy for mcts in dogs.

toceranib phosphate is one such receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of kit, approved for the treatment of recurrent, non-resectable grades  <dig> and  <dig> canine mcts  <cit> . while toc has demonstrated significant biological activity, its usefulness is significantly limited by the eventual acquisition of drug resistance. in a multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study of oral toc, approximately 40% of dogs experienced an objective response while the remaining 60% demonstrated no response, likely due to de novo resistance. two-thirds of the responders were positive for an activating mutation in c-kit. the average time to tumor progression in all responders was 18 weeks; therefore, virtually all dogs with mcts have either intrinsic toc resistance or eventually develop resistance  <cit> . therefore, there exists a need to identify distinctive clinical and molecular features of resistance in this population.

the aim of the current study was to develop a model of acquired toc resistance in canine mct. acquired resistance was modeled in vitro using the toc-sensitive c <dig> canine mct cell line to subsequently allow us to investigate mechanisms of acquired resistance in order to ultimately develop second-line inhibitors as well as rational drug combination therapies for the treatment of toc-resistant mcts in dogs.

RESULTS
toceranib-resistant c <dig> cells emerged during chronic, stepwise toc treatment
to explore mechanisms of acquired toc resistance in canine mct, we generated three resistant sublines from the toc-sensitive exon  <dig> itd c-kit mutant c <dig> cell line designated tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig>  growth of the parental c <dig> cells was inhibited by toc in a dose-dependent manner with an ic <dig> of < <dig> nm. in contrast, tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> sublines were resistant to inhibition by toc  . sensitivity to three other kit rtk inhibitors was similar to the observed resistance to toc. the parental line as well as all three sublines retained sensitivity to the cytotoxic agents vinblastine  and ccnu . following 72 hr culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of toc, treatment naïve, parental c <dig> cells detached from the culture flask and became rounded, shrunken, and clumped with increased exposure to toc. in contrast, toc-induced morphologic differences were not identified in the resistant sublines.

toceranib induces apoptosis in parental c <dig> cells, but not the toc-resistant sublines
tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to promote growth inhibition in c <dig> cells by induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest  <cit> . to explore this, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  assays and morphological evaluations were performed on all four cell lines to determine the effects of toc and the cytotoxic agents, vbl and ccnu, on apoptosis. following 72 hr of increasing exposure to toc, a qualitative increase in the number of cells displaying increased tunel reactivity and morphologic evidence of apoptosis  was observed in the parental line. in contrast, no increase in either positive tunel staining or morphologic evidence of apoptosis was observed in the three toc-resistant sublines . the parental line and all three resistant sublines demonstrated an equivalent increase in both tunel staining and apoptotic morphology after 72 hr of vbl  or ccnu exposure .

kit phosphorylation in resistant cells does not decrease after toceranib treatment
to determine whether the lack of growth inhibition observed in the resistant sublines in figure 1a was due to a lack of inhibition of autophosphorylation by toc, the cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of toc for 24 hours and western analysis for phosphorylated and total kit was performed. toc inhibited kit phosphorylation in the parental c <dig> line in a dose-dependent manner while phosphorylation of the kit receptor was maintained in the presence of toc in all three resistant sublines .

chronic toc exposure resulted in significant overexpression of c-kit mrna and kit protein in the toc-resistant sublines
to investigate whether overexpression of the target kinase contributes to the observed toc resistance, c-kit mrna and kit protein expression was measured by real-time quantitative pcr and flow cytometry, respectively. indeed, toc-resistant sublines demonstrated up to a four-fold increase in kit receptor expression compared to the parental, treatment naïve c <dig> cells . additionally, densitometric analysis of chemiluminescent signals of total kit from figure  <dig> was performed using image j software , which demonstrated significant overexpression of kit in all three resistant sublines compared to the parental line .
c-kit 
and kit expression in c <dig>  tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> cells by rt-qpcr  and flow cytometry , respectively.

c <dig>  tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> sublines demonstrate minimal p-gp activity and no functional p-gp
to determine if toc resistance is caused by overexpression and increased functional activity of the drug transporter p-glycoprotein , western analysis and rhodamine uptake/efflux assays were performed, respectively, in all four sublines. while mdr1-overexpressing mdck cells showed significant overexpression of p-gp, all four sublines demonstrated little to no p-gp expression, even when blots were overexposed . furthermore, densitometric analysis of chemiluminescent signals of p-gp showed no significant differences in p-gp expression in the resistant sublines versus the parental line . the activity of p-gp in the same cells was determined by rhodamine uptake/efflux. as expected, mdr1-mdck cells demonstrated a lower fluorescence signal compared to c <dig>  tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> cells. administration of the p-gp inhibitor, verapamil, increased the fluorescence signal in the mdr1-mdck cells, however, no shift in the fluorescence signal was detected in the c <dig>  tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig> cells .

secondary c-kit mutations are present in the juxtamembrane and kinase domains of c-kit in resistant sublines
to assess whether the development of secondary mutations in the c-kit gene conferred the observed resistance to toc, full-length canine c-kit from the toc-sensitive and -resistant sublines was cloned and sequenced. cdna sequence analyses of full length c-kit from each clone after assembly and comparison of 7- <dig> clones from each subline was performed. a total of six point mutations were identified in the juxtamembrane and kinase domains of 30-50% of the resistant clones. these included q574r in exon  <dig> and m835t in exon  <dig> of tr1; k724r in exon  <dig> of tr2; and k58r in exon  <dig>  r584g in exon  <dig>  and a620s in exon  <dig> of tr <dig> . these novel mutations were not identified in any of the parental c <dig> clones. additionally, alternative splice sites between exons  <dig> and  <dig> and exons  <dig> and  <dig> were identified in all sublines. these transcripts utilize alternate splice donors  3′ to exons  <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, retention of the original 48-bp internal tandem duplication in exon  <dig> of the parental line was observed in all three resistant sublines.

discussion
the identification of protein kinases as instrumental regulators in the tumorigenesis of many forms of neoplasia has led to the development of numerous small molecule kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. the understanding of the molecular pathway driving the development of at least some canine cutaneous mct, its addiction to a dominant oncogene, coupled with the identification of a “druggable” target has resulted in significant progress toward its treatment. activating mutations in the c-kit proto-oncogene confer growth-factor independent activation of the kit receptor tyrosine kinase, subsequent downstream signaling, and enhanced proliferation and survival of malignant mast cells  <cit> . ligand-independent activation of the kit pathway most commonly occurs due to a mutation in the juxtamembrane domain in exon  <dig>  <cit> . this domain has a negative regulatory function by maintaining the kit receptor in its inactive conformation in the absence of ligand binding. mutations in this domain result in an active conformation due to disruption of the inhibitory motif resulting in autophosphorylation of the kit receptor and downstream signaling  <cit> . upon binding the atp-binding pocket within the tk domain, the small molecule kit receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogate kit signaling and induce growth inhibition and apoptosis  <cit> . dogs with mcts harboring an activating mutation in the c-kit proto-oncogene have demonstrated significantly increased response rates to toc  <cit> . despite these benefits, the responses are often transitory as tumors commonly develop resistance to toc.

to begin to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to toc, we have successfully developed a model of acquired resistance using a canine mct cell line by continuously exposing cells to increasing concentrations of toc, resulting in three independent sublines that are resistant to toc. the c <dig> mct cell line harbors the kit-activating itd mutation in exon  <dig>  which represents the most common mutation in canine mct  <cit> . in one study, 64% of kit mutations identified in canine mct were itds in exon  <dig>  <cit> . as such, the c <dig> cell line is a clinically-relevant canine mct line for these investigations. while the parental c <dig> line demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition following treatment with toc, the three sublines, tr <dig>  tr <dig>  and tr <dig>  remained resistant to toc exposure. similarly, toc exposure caused an induction of apoptosis in the parental line while no evidence of apoptosis was observed in the three sublines following similar toc exposure. importantly, the toc-resistant sublines retained sensitivity to the cytotoxic agents vinblastine and ccnu, and demonstrated variable sensitivity to other kit kinase inhibitors. this lack of apparent cross-resistance to the conventional cytotoxic agents vbl and ccnu suggests that these drugs may remain active in patients with toc-refractory disease. in dogs, the range of achievable concentrations for toc in vivo has been reported between  <dig> nm  and  <dig> nm   <cit> . in the current study, growth inhibition assays were carried out to  <dig> um, nearly 5-fold the reported cmax for toc. however, there may be a small therapeutic window in which higher concentrations of masitinib may override toc-resistance in mct as the tested concentrations were lower than the cmax reported in dogs  but, this is beyond the scope of the current investigations  <cit> .

there are several reported pathway-dependent mechanisms of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. one of the most common mechanisms is acquisition of secondary mutations within the target oncogene leading to either reactivation of the target protein or induction of a conformational change in the drug binding pocket resulting in reduced binding affinity  <cit> . as kit tyrosine kinase inhibitors bind to the atp-binding pocket of a kinase in a competitive fashion, mutations located in the in the drug/atp-binding pocket of the receptor are associated with acquired drug resistance. heinrich and co-workers showed that secondary point mutations located in the atp-binding pocket of the kit receptor  are associated with resistance to imatinib, a kit receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors   <cit> . in the current study, the observed variable resistance to the three other kit inhibitors, both between the three inhibitors  and among the three resistant sublines, suggests that there may be differences in drug binding kinetics among the four compounds and perhaps differences in mechanisms of acquired resistance between the three sublines, respectively.

engagement of alternative or bypass signaling pathways is another common mechanism of acquired resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors  <cit> . this can occur independent of the target oncogene to which a tumor is addicted. indeed, the activation of a bypass pathway has been shown to overcome kit inhibition in human gists. gist cells resistant to imatinib demonstrated increased activation of the akt pathway leading to continued cell growth and survival  <cit> . nazarian and co-workers showed that melanomas harboring a braf  mutation eventually become resistant to the raf-selective inhibitor, plx <dig>  by activation of an alternative survival pathway mediated by pdgfrβ  <cit> .

in addition to secondary mutations in the target oncogene and activation of bypass signaling pathways, resistance to targeted therapies can also occur through activation of effector proteins upstream and/or downstream of the intended target. nazarian and co-workers also demonstrated reactivation of nras signaling in plx4032-refractory melanomas leading to mapk pathway reactivation and disease progression  <cit> . similarly, wagle and co-workers demonstrated activating mutations in mek <dig> and subsequent reactivation of the mapk pathway following treatment of melanoma with plx <dig>  <cit> .

to begin to explore these possibilities in our toc-resistant canine mct model, we examined kit activation status in the parental and toc-resistant c <dig> sublines by western blot analysis using an antibody against kit phosphorylated at tyr <dig>  while phosphorylated kit was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the parental line, kit activation was maintained in the presence of increasing concentrations of toc in all three resistant sublines. these data led to the hypothesis that acquisition of a secondary mutation in the c-kit proto-oncogene would be, in part, responsible for the observed toc resistance. to that end, full-length canine c-kit was cloned and sequenced. the original itd mutation in exon  <dig> was maintained in all three resistant sublines. indeed, we detected several different point mutations in the resistant sublines leading to amino acid substitutions. interestingly, all of these mutations were located in the functional domains of the kit receptor. computational modeling of these mutations is in process to ascertain whether they impede contact between the kit inhibitors, including toc, and their binding sites or alter spatial conformation of the target protein. the frequency with which these mutations were identified in the resistant clones was between 30-50%. this likely represents the heterogeneity associated with resistance mechanisms. it has been shown that multiple drug-resistant mutations and disparate mechanisms of resistance can frequently occur in a single population of tumor cells  <cit> . these include from multiple secondary mutations in the target kinase as well as independent mechanisms such as activation of a bypass pathway. other single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified in single clones. these are likely a result of polymerase error when observed in a single clone, but when duplicated represent transcript heterogeneity resulting from genomic instability perhaps as a result of deficiencies in the dna repair machinery. alternative signaling pathways that bypass inhibition of the target protein, kit, were not pursued in the current study. constitutive activation of kit in the presence of toc in the resistant sublines strongly suggests that the mechanism of resistance occurs at the level of the kit receptor.

a final pathway-dependent mechanism of acquired resistance is through genomic amplification of the target gene. amplification of the target gene and subsequent overexpression of the target kinase, can alter the drug-target stoichiometry such that inhibition is diminished and cell survival and proliferation persists  <cit> . genomic amplification of c-kit has been reported in imatinib-resistant gists as a mechanism of acquired resistance  <cit> . ercan and co-workers demonstrated that although non-small lung cancers harboring a egfr t790m mutation transiently respond to egfr inhibitors, clones over-expressing egfr t790m eventually emerge leading to clinical resistance  <cit> . increased expression of the target protein bcr/abl, resulting from genomic oncogene amplification, was observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia  cell lines that became refractory to the selective abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib  <cit> . in the current study, analysis of c-kit mrna expression by real-time quantitative pcr demonstrated a significant increase in c-kit expression in the toc-resistant c <dig> sublines compared to the treatment-naïve parental c <dig> cells. to determine if this increase in c-kit transcript led to a subsequent increase in kit receptor expression, flow cytometry was performed. indeed, a significant increase in kit receptor expression was demonstrated in the three toc-resistant c <dig> sublines compared to the toc-sensitive parental c <dig> cells. this could confer the observed resistance as binding of toc to the overexpressed target could deplete the amount of intracellular drug available. as such, increasing the dose of toc would be a reasonable therapeutic approach to overcome kit-overpexpressing toc-resistant canine mast cell tumors. however, in the current model, growth inhibition assays were carried out to doses of toc 100-fold the ic <dig> of the treatment naïve parental c <dig> cells and an ic <dig> was not reached in all three resistant lines. therefore, these data suggest that a four-fold increase in expression of the target protein by itself is likely not adequate to confer the observed resistance. amplification of the target oncogene, and subsequent overexpression of the encoded target protein, may have been driven in response to continued pressure by the kit inhibitor. alternatively, because the toc-resistant sublines initially responded to toc and maintained the original itd activating c-kit mutation in exon  <dig>  it is possible that the resistant sublines were derived from a distinct c-kit-amplified subpopulation of c-kit-mutant cells that were subsequently selected for during toc administration.

while the current study focuses on pathway-dependent mechanisms of kit rtk resistance, there are several reported pathway-independent mechanisms of resistance that were investigated. these include pharmacological factors that ultimately diminish drug exposure. drug-efflux pumps, such as p-glycoprotein  encoded by mdr <dig>  have been shown to be overexpressed in several tki-resistant tumors and cell lines. mahone and co-workers reported a significant overexpression of p-gp in imatinib-resistant leukemia cell lines  <cit> . furthermore, sensitivity was restored following administration of several p-gp inhibitors. nakaichi and co-workers reported the expression of p-gp and mdr- <dig> by western blot analysis and rt-pcr, respectively, in several canine mct cell lines, excluding c <dig>  <cit> . sunitinib, a structural analog of toceranib, has been shown to be a substrate of p-gp. as such, we investigated the role of drug efflux in toc-resistant canine c <dig> cells as a mechanism of resistance by measuring p-gp expression and function  <cit> . the expression of p-gp was determined in all four c <dig> sublines and mdr1-overexpressing mdck cells by western analysis. while the presence of p-gp was confirmed in all four sublines, there were no significant differences in expression between the toc-sensitive cells and toc-resistant cells. furthermore, all four c <dig> sublines showed minimal functional p-gp as measured by rhodamine efflux with or without administration of the p-gp inhibitor, verapamil.

CONCLUSIONS
sustained kit signaling appears required for c-kit mutant mct survival. regardless of the specific mechanism of acquired toc resistance outlined above, all may lead to reactivation of the kit signaling pathway and ultimately tumor progression. our results demonstrate that continuous, chronic exposure of c <dig> cells to toc causes eventual drug resistance. we demonstrate that overexpression of the kit receptor is, in part, responsible for the observed toc resistance, and have identified several candidate mutations that may play a role in resistance acquisition. the identification of these and other potential mechanisms of toc resistance is necessary for the identification of second line kit inhibitors or alternate therapeutic strategies for the treatment of high grade, non-resectable canine mct that are refractory to toc. furthermore, we have created in vitro tools that can be utilized for future study of re-sensitization strategies for toc-resistant canine mct.
