BACKGROUND
manganese peroxidase   belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specifically those actions on peroxide as acceptor , is an extracellular hemeprotein which catalyze the h2o2-dependent oxidation of lignin-derivatives based polymers  <cit> . mnp is a specific enzyme that can oxidize mn2+ to mn3+, which diffuses from the enzyme surface and in turn oxidizes the phenolic substrate, including lignin model compounds and some organic pollutants  <cit> . in nature, mnp catalyzes plant lignin de-polymerization as component of ligninolytic enzymes complex. so it is one of the most common lignin degradation enzymes and has great application potential in the field of agriculture for degradation of some cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, etc. to protect the environment, it was widely used in many industrial fields for degradation some recalcitrant organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorophenols, industrial dyes and nitroaromatic compounds, which are very harmful to human health  <cit> . recently, more and more attention has been paid to the value of bioremediation of this enzyme.

mnp was first discovered in phanerochaete chrysosporium  <cit>  and seems to be the most ubiquitous ligninolytic enzyme among white-rot fungi. at present, it has been purified and characterized from various white rot fungi . properties and application on mnps isolated from different sources had been investigated widely. much previous research has suggested that some azo dyes could be efficiently degraded by the purified mnps, which were isolated from p. chrysosporium, lentinula edodes, trametes versicolor, dichomitus squalens, stereum ostrea, irpex lacteus and etc. . however, many factors influenced the application of mnp, which include slow fungal growth rate, accumulation of extracellular polysaccharides, similar chromatographic properties of mnp and laccase, and etc.  <cit> . therefore, searching for new mnp from widely distributed worldwide and fast fungal growth rate is essential for the application of mnp in industrial and agricultural productions, and environmental protection.


ganoderma, a white rot basidiomycete widely distributed worldwide, can be cultivated on various substrates by different cultivation model, and could secrete lignin-modifying enzymes , including laccase , lignin peroxidases  and mnp. because of the rapid growth rate and extensive decolorization on solid media, ganoderma is suitable for a wide range of applications in the field of environment and biotechnology; previous publications had reported that several species of ganoderma can produce high amounts of mnp enzymes in solid or liquid cultures  <cit> . however, as we know, few studies focused their attention on the evaluation of the capability of purified and heterologous expression mnp tolerating different for dyes or other industrial pollutants. in the previous publications, most of them mainly focused on inducing secretion of mnp from different ganoderma, and their potential uses in decolorization of textile effluents  <cit>  and degrades β-carotene from g. applanatum under alkaline conditions  <cit> .

in the present study, the possible difference of various g. lucidum strain for production of the mnps was investigated using a qualitative plate assay method by using o-methoxyphenol as a color indicator. the fungal colony showing the largest zone of decolorization was selected for cloning the mnp <dig> cdna sequence, and then an expression vector, pao815:: glumnp <dig>  was constructed and transferred into p. pastoris smd1168h by electroporation-mediated transformation. the expression products were demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and western blotting. we also carried out a preliminary exploration on the ability of rglumnp <dig> to biodegrade four dyes and phenol, and infer a probable degradation route of phenolic compounds, which should be taken into account in producing and designing a related industrial wastewater treatment process. this study provides a production strategy for mnp and will aid our understanding of the role of fungal mnp oxidation in biodegradation and bioremediation.

RESULTS
selection of the strain from various g. species
the ability of producing lignin-degrading enzymes of five species of g. lucidum strains was measured by comparing the diameter of the colony and reddish brown circles. the results showed that the ratio of diameter of reddish brown circles and the diameter of fungal colony was the largest when g. lucidum  <dig> was cultured for 7 days . in order to better understand the lignin-degrading enzyme from g. lucidum, we tested the action of manganese peroxidase. at initial concentrations of  <dig>  mm nh4
2+ and 3 μm mn2+, extracellular production of mnp and lac began by day  <dig>  with maximum levels of  <dig> u/l lac on day  <dig> and  <dig> u/l mnp on day  <dig>  at a higher initial mn2+ concentration of 200 μm, mnp and lac production also began at day  <dig> with more mnp produced. the maximum level of lac was less. no lip was detected. the results showed that initial concentrations of  <dig>  mm nh4
2+ and 200 μm mn2+, extracellular production of mnp of g. lucidum  <dig> with maximum levels, reached  <dig>  . despite significant differences in enzyme production, cultures at both mn2+ concentrations rapidly colorful reaction in the pda-o-methoxyphenol plate, with no difference in the ratio of diameter of reddish brown circles . as a result, the fungal colony of g. lucidum  <dig> for highest decolorization zone was chosen for the further study.fig.  <dig> decolorization of o-methoxyphenol with five g. lucidum strains. g. lucidm  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was cultured on pda medium for  <dig> d, and then was taken photographs. a displayed on the front of the petri dish, and  displayed the reverse side of the petri dish

decolorization of four dyes by the culture supernatants of g. lucidum strains
the results showed that g. lucidum  <dig> could efficiently decolorize these four dyes. drimaren blue cl-br, drimaren yellow x-8gn, drimaren red k-4bl in the aqueous solutions  were respectively decolorized up to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % by g. lucidum  <dig> within 72 h. disperse navy blue hgl in the aqueous solution  could be decolorized up to  <dig> % by g. lucidum  <dig> within 12 h. mnp, lac, and lip activities were assayed in the supernatant medium before and after decolorization. extracellular mnp activities were significantly induced by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively after decolorization of four dyes by g. lucidum  <dig>  less lac and nor lip was detected during the decolorization process. induction in mnp activity during the decolorization process suggested that mnp was involved in the decolorization of these four dyes.

isolation and sequence characterization of the mnp gene
based on total rna isolated from the mycelia of g. lucidum, degenerate primers mnpf <dig> and mnpr <dig>  were used to specifically amplify a 461 bp core fragment using a method of the one-step real-time reverse transcriptase-pcr  . a blast search showed that the pcr core fragment was homologous to mnp genes from other white rot fungi species . the 5′ and 3′-ends fragments  were amplified by 5′ race  and 3′ race , based on the 461 bp core fragments. the core fragment, and the 3′- and 5′-ends fragments were assembled using vector nti suite  <dig> and the deduced full-length glumnp <dig> cdna sequence obtained was confirmed by sequencing. the full-length cdna of glumnp <dig> was  <dig>  bp , comprising a 70 bp 5′-untranslated region, an orf of 1095 bp and a 176 bp 3′-untranslated region.

sequence analysis confirmed isolation of a full-length cdna of glmnp <dig> encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and isoelectric point  of  <dig> . amino acids of glmnp <dig> involved in aromatic substrate oxidation on the distal side of the heme, ca2+ side binding residues, heme pocket residues and mn2+ binding site. these features suggested that glmnp <dig> encoded a probable manganese peroxidase. a database search with blastx  showed that there was a relatively high similarity between glumnp <dig> and other mnps from strains, such as glumnp, gapmnp, gfomnp, and gaumnp. a number of gaps and insertions were made in the sequences to optimize the alignment. the percentages of identity among glumnp, gaumnp, and gfomnp were  <dig>   <dig> and 87%, respectively, suggesting they were closely related to each other . amino acids of glumnp <dig> involved in aromatic substrate oxidation were first analyzed and compared with various other plants and fungi by bioinformatics analysis . amino acids involved in aromatic substrate oxidation  on the distal side of the heme, ca2+ side binding residues , heme pocket residues  and mn2+ binding site  were conserved in the mnp sequences from g. lucidum as well as in peroxidase sequences from various other plants and fungi. the deduced sequence contained eight cysteines , which probably form four disulfide bonds in the mature protein.

heterologous expression of glumnp <dig> gene in p. pastoris
the presence of glumnp <dig> in the transformants was confirmed by pcr . sds-page analysis after coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> staining indicated that rglumnp <dig> could be efficiently expressed in p. pastoris cells . the theoretical mass of the target rglumnp <dig> protein was  <dig> kda, and the mass of the rglumnp <dig> protein after glycosylation modification was higher than the theoretical value.fig.  <dig> electrophoresis of pcr amplification of glumnp <dig> from pao815::glumnp <dig> lane m: dna marker dl 10000; lane nc: negative control; lane pc: positive control; lane 1–13: selected transformants. the hollow arrow showed the dna bands of aox gene from yeast . the solid arrow showed the dna bands of the glumnp <dig> gene plus a part of vector sequences

the size of expressed protein was analyzed by western blotting of samples from a three-day fermentation of the yeast. the results of western blot analysis showed that the target protein of glumnp <dig> from g. lucidum was heterologously expressed in p. pastoris .

analysis of enzyme yield and activity
the content of total soluble protein was determined approximately 1258 mg/l using the bradford protein assay kit. the density of protein bands was detected using the software bandscan  <dig>   and the rglumnp <dig> protein was estimated to account for about 10% of total soluble protein. therefore, the yield of rglumnp <dig> produced by the yeast transformants reached roughly 126 mg/l.

methanol was used to induce expression in the p. pastoris transformants in bmmy medium. after fragmenting of p. pastoris and centrifugation, the highest rglumnp <dig> activity in the culture supernatant of total protein extracted from p. pastoris transformants reached about  <dig>  u/l after 48 h of incubation.

decolorization of four dyes using the rglumnp1
the decolorization experiments were performed with crude protein extracts in 50 mm sodium malonate  and 500 mg/l of dyes in a final volume of 1 ml at 25 °c. the results showed that the maximum decolorization rates of the four dyes all reached 70% , indicating that rglumnp <dig> had a higher decolorizing ability. reaction containing mnso <dig> and h2o <dig> could only decolorize four dyes by about 49% in 15 min. however, rglumnp <dig> could decolorize drimaren red k-4bl by more than 62% after 15 min. the decolorization rates of the four dyes increased quickly at the start of the reaction, but increased more slowly after 30 min.fig.  <dig> time course and visual effect of decolorization of four dyes by the crude enzymatic solution. a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and d <dig> show the in vitro decolorization rate of four dyes over time by consumption of crude rglumnp <dig>  which included drimaren blue cl-br , drimaren yellow x-8gn , drimaren red k-4bl  and disperse navy blue hgl . the black line in each image shows the decolorization rate after treatment by rglumnp1; the red line shows the results for the negative control. a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and d <dig> showed the visual decolorization effect of four dyes by control  and crude rglumnp <dig> solutions .  and  show the visual decolorization effects before/after treated by the untransformed yeast,  and  show the visual decolorization effects before/after treated by the yeast transformants. yeasts were broken to prepare the crude enzyme solutions. the reactions were carried out in a 2 ml ep tube




hplc-based analysis of the degradation rate of phenol and the principal degradation products
based on the establishment of the standard curves of phenol and the principal degradation products , the regression equations of calibration curves and their coefficients were calculated as follows: for phenol, y =  <dig> x +  <dig> ; for hydroquinone, y = 11297x −  <dig>  ; for pyrocatechol, y = 13955x −  <dig> . the high performance liquid chromatography  analysis results showed that rglumnp <dig> solutions can degrade phenol in aqueous solution effectively and the degradation products contained hydroquinone and pyrocatechol at least . furtherly, the contents of phenol in the samples dealt with by the crude enzymes solutions at the concentration of  <dig>   <dig> and 15% were about  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. the degradation rates of phenol in aqueous solution treated by  <dig>   <dig> and 15% crude enzymes solutions were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively. the results suggested that optimum concentration of crude enzymes solutions was about 10% under the present conditions.fig.  <dig> hplc chromatography of phenol and the main degradation products. hplc analysis of the phenol  and its main degradation products of hydroquinone , pyrocatechol . the aqueous solutions of phenol were treated by 5% , 10%  and 15%  rglmnp <dig> enzyme solutions, respectively




the hplc analysis results of the likely oxidation products of phenol showed that among the four possible degradation products including hydroquinone, pyrocatechol, resorcinol and benzoquinone, only two chemical compounds, hydroquinone and pyrocatechol were determined in the treated sample, the others were not determined by hplc . the contents of hydroquinone and pyrocatechol in the sample treated by crude enzymes solutions at the concentration of  <dig>   <dig> and 15% were found to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively.

discussion
for screening process on the ability of producing lmes from different g. lucidum strains by comparing the diameter of the colony and reddish brown circles, based on previous theory, the smaller the ratio is, the stronger the strains’ ability of producing lignin-degrading enzymes is  <cit> . as a result, g. lucidum  <dig> selected for the further study should be correct. previous studies had demonstrated that mn peroxidase production was controlled by the concentration of mn2+  <cit> . at higher mn2+ concentrations, production of mnp increased and that of laccase decreased, but the rate or number of decolozations was unaffected  <cit> . in addition, the nitrogen source and its concentration were found to influence mnp production  <cit> . in order to obtain more information about the mnp from g. lucidum, mn and nitrogen concentration were routine used to test the effects of mnp production and activity in the present study.

white rot fungi have been widely studied over the last 30 years because they could release lmes and had a high capacity for biodegradation of environmental pollutants  <cit> . most white-rot basidiomycetes are capable of degrading or oxidizing a range of aromatic organic compounds with the aid of certain enzymes, such as lip, mnp and other versatile peroxidases  <cit> . to date, more than thirty enzymes have been isolated and investigated from at least a dozen ganoderma species. mnp, as one of major fungal oxidative enzymes, plays a key role in enzymatic degradation of phenolic compounds in vitro. there are many reports concerning the decolorization of wastewater from dyeing factories  <cit> . however, high-level expression of mnp must be taken into account before it can be used commercially. mnp expression level in some isolates is too low for industrial application. heterologous expression in p. pastoris could meet these requirements, because it enhanced the expression levels by 10-, 100-, or even 1000-fold compared with the natural host  <cit> .


g. lucidum contained  <dig> peroxidases genes in its genome, was the third largest number of peroxidases, which may suggest its strong ligninolytic ability  <cit> . in order to better use ganoderma mnp for the degradation of different phenolic compounds, the mnp gene of and its full-length cdna were successfully cloned and characterized from g. lucidum  <dig>  in the process of yeast expression, the complexity of the yeast intracellular proteins meant that the target protein would migrate with other proteins, possibly resulting in no significant band being observed on sds-page; however, as the recombinant expressed protein is expressed at a higher level than similar sized endogenous proteins, an individual protein band was observed that was not present in the negative control, indicating expression of the target protein . for the yield or enzymatic activity of protein expression, compared with the native host, recombinant fungi and yeast strains could produce from  <dig> to 100 mg/l rmnp  <cit> . comparing with the results of previous studies  <cit> , in the present study, the highest rglumnp <dig> activity in the culture supernatant of total protein extracted from p. pastoris transformants reached about  <dig>  u/l at 25 °c and ph  <dig> .

peroxidases are hemoproteins that catalyze reactions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. mnps have a reaction mechanism that starts with enzyme oxidation by h2o <dig> to an oxidized state during the catalytic cycle  <cit> . the degradation mechanism of lmes has been studied extensively using different white rot fungi  <cit> . zhang et al.  demonstrated that mnp plays an important role in the decolorization of cotton bleaching effluent by an unidentified white-rot fungus, while there was no obvious role for lip in this decolorization  <cit> . in other words, the relationship between these fungal oxidative enzymes in the decolorization process is not clear. however, it is likely that the main enzymes that decolorize different dyes are not the same  <cit> . in  <dig>  champagne and ramsay approved that the combination of the mnp and lac had an additive effect, and that mnp was the principal active enzyme in the reaction process  <cit> . although h2o <dig> or −oh may oxidize a dye without an enzyme, the decolorization of dyes mainly relies on mn3+ acting on the organic acid compounds, which were also demonstrated in this study. in addition, based on the opinions of previous literature  <cit> , a crude enzymatic solution was used to decolorize the four dyes in the present study, which could narrow the high costs associated with enzyme purification.

the above analysis had proved that the hydroxyl radical played a major role in phenol degradation. resorcinol and benzoquinone were not found in the probable oxidation products due to the in perfect reaction system or in appropriate reaction conditions. we infer that the results are relevant to the phenol structure. the electronic arc in phenolic hydroxyl oxygen atom can have p-π conjugation with π electronic in the phenyl ring which made phenyl ring had more negative charge on the ortho- and/or para- in phenolic hydroxyl. so it is not difficult to produce hydroquinone and pyrocatechol by hydroxyl radical attack. the carboxylation of the phenyl ring is the first step of phenolic compounds degradation. subsequently, the phenyl ring was open for the formation of carboxyl aromatic ring, and finally was completely mineralized to carbon dioxide and water   <cit> . phenol intermediate products and its degradation route were needed for further investigation and analysis.fig.  <dig> pictorial scheme of the enzymatic degradation route of phenol. ① hydroxylation of benzene formed the dihydroxybenzene and quinones. ② dihydroxybenzene and quinones dehydrogenated and opened loop to form carboxylic acids. ③ carboxylic acids mineralized to carbon dioxide and water. dashed frame represented the compounds that were detected in this experiment




CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we found ganoderma strains with a capacity of the decolorisation of four types of dyes, cloned a mnp gene from g. lucidum  <dig> and expressed this gene in the methylotrophic yeast p. pastoris that produced an intracellular rglumnp <dig> with a stable and active form. the higher oxidation capacity of the recombinant proteins was established by using the enzymes for the decolorization of four dyes and the degradation of phenol, in which phenol and the main degradation products were especially confirmed by hplc. from this result, we inferred that the degradation of phenolic compounds may relate to the phenol structure. in the initial stages of the reaction, this catechol-mediated cycle should be the principal route of enzymatic degradation of phenol and its oxidation products. in summary, the rglumnp <dig> showed a great potential for the enzymatic degradation of industrial dyes and phenolic compounds.
