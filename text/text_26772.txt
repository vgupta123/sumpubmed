BACKGROUND
the channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus, is native to north america and is from the order siluriformes  which is considered more primitive among teleosts  <cit> . commercial production of catfish as dietary protein is the leading industry of north american aquaculture, with more than  <dig> million pounds of catfish produced annually in the united states  <cit> . one of the most significant factors limiting production is loss to disease, and one of our goals is to improve non-specific immunity through selective breeding. the channel catfish immune system is the best characterized for any fish species, and it is the only fish species where clonal functionally distinct lymphocyte lines can be readily established  <cit> . however, there is a need to better understand the physiological and immunological pathways controlling host-pathogen interactions in vivo.

improvement of disease resistance in catfish populations depends on an understanding of the genetic control of immune-related pathways, response to pathogens, and correlations with other production traits. recent developments in genomic technology, particularly high-throughput cdna sequencing and development of expressed sequence microarrays, have made possible the profiling of global gene expression in experimental fish tissues.

microarray experiments have been utilized to determine regulation of gene expression during developmental and adaptive processes in several fish species. using this technology, groups of coordinately expressed genes were identified in zebrafish embryos during development  <cit> . microarrays were used to identify changes in gene expression patterns in zebrafish and goby exposed to differing levels of available oxygen  <cit> , in common carp exposed to cold temperature  <cit> , and in rainbow trout exposed to handling stress  <cit> .

recently, expression microarrays have been used to identify genes involved in host-pathogen relationships. experimental infection of cells in vitro revealed differential gene expression in flounder kidney cells  <cit> , and in rainbow trout monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . transcriptional analysis was performed on kidney cells after experimental in vivo injection of flounder with a dna vector expressing the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus g protein  <cit> , in atlantic salmon macrophages and anterior kidney tissues after injection of fish with p. salmonis  <cit> , on atlantic salmon liver, spleen, and anterior kidney tissues after cohabitation with a. salmonicida-infected fish  <cit> , and from whole zebrafish after infection with m. marinum  <cit> . by measuring changes in gene expression after pathogen challenge, researchers may identify gene expression fingerprints that provide clues to molecular pathways involved in pathogen neutralization and/or removal, identify candidate genes controlling pathogen-specific immunity, and identify heritable differences in gene expression levels that correlate with disease resistance/susceptibility. this data would help in the formulation of a selection index to identify broodstock with superior genetic potential for resistance to disease.

while microarray-based transcriptional analysis is a useful tool for functional genomics in fish, to date there has been no microarray platform available for catfish species. thus, we developed a catfish microarray utilizing existing data from channel catfish expressed sequences obtained in cdna cloning experiments from several tissues . these sequences have been clustered and annotated in the catfish gene index  <cit> . the catfish microarray was used to measure differential gene expression in the spleen of lipopolysaccharide-injected and sham-injected catfish.

RESULTS
a high density oligonucleotide microarray was produced that contained  <dig>  catfish expressed sequences, each represented by ten perfectly matched and ten mismatched 24-mer oligonucleotides . this microarray contained  <dig> sequences that matched an annotated sequence in genbank. discounting  <dig> that matched transposons or sequences that were labelled as unknown, unnamed, or hypothetical, there were  <dig> annotated sequences  on the microarray. this microarray was used to demonstrate differences in global gene expression in the spleen of lps-treated catfish. using significance analysis of microarrays , we identified  <dig> sequences that were differentially expressed after lps treatment .

there were  <dig> genes up-regulated by lps exposure of which only  <dig> were annotated based on sequence similarity . among these were cytokines and chemokines, such as il-1β, ccl <dig>  a small cxc/il 8-like chemokine, and chondromodulin ii. transcriptional factors such as nf-κb p <dig> subunit and nf-κb inhibitor alpha-like proteins a and b, interferon regulatory factor i, and ap- <dig> were also upregulated at least 2-fold. expression of toll-like receptor  <dig> was upregulated at 2– <dig> h post-exposure. within the experimental timeframe, almost all induced genes were induced by  <dig> h post-exposure.

there were  <dig> genes that were significantly down-regulated in response to lps, of which only  <dig> were annotated based on sequence similarity . among these genes were the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains, mhc class ii antigens, invariant chain-like protein  <dig>  an nk lysin-like protein, complement c <dig>  hemoglobin alpha, and a cxc chemokine receptor.

in the present research, we selected nine expressed sequences representing varying levels of expression to verify the microarray results using real-time rt-pcr . linear regression of log transformed expression data demonstrated a strong positive correlation  between the two technologies . the microarray results for tnfα failed to pass our quality control criteria, thus no expression ratios were reported .

discussion
microarray performance
in our first attempt to monitor the global gene expression profile after lps stimulation in channel catfish spleen, we have constructed a high-density oligonucleotide microarray containing almost  <dig>  catfish unique sequences. in the present research, we used real-time rt-pcr to verify the microarray results. the analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the microarray and real-time rt-pcr results. the tnfα gene was selected based on its importance in the lps pathway and also to represent genes that did not make the final "hit" list. the tnfα microarray results failed to pass our quality control criteria, so no ratios were reported. after examination of the oligo sequences for tnfα on the microarray, we found only one of the ten probe sets demonstrated a significant difference in signal intensity between the perfectly matched and mismatched oligos. five of the tnfα probe sets contained higher signal intensities in the mismatched than in the perfectly matched oligo. the automated oligo design software extracted all ten oligo sets from the most 5' end of the  <dig> bp tnfα cdna sequence, so the discrepancy between real-time rt-pcr and microarray results for tnfα was likely due to undesirable oligo design. in fact, the one "good" oligo pair would have identified up-regulation of tnfα by lps. this observation highlights the importance of high quality oligo design software, and that the ability to identify and eventually remove problematic oligo probes is critical to the collection of robust microarray data and minimization of discordant gene expression data from different technologies.

differential expression of catfish genes
the evolutionary divergence between mammalian and fish species is considerable, and we do not know if lps can induce the ikk-nf-κb pathway and mapk pathways  in fish as in mammals. although lps-responsive cis-elements have been identified in the 5'-flanking region of many mammalian genes  <cit> , none have been reported in catfish to date. the present research demonstrated increased expression of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb at  <dig> h post-lps exposure, but a sequence matching nf-κb inhibitor alpha-like proteins a and b were also significantly induced at  <dig> h post-lps exposure. nf-κb inhibitor gene expression was also increased in mycobacterium-infected zebrafish  <cit>  and bacterially infected macrophage cells from atlantic salmon and rainbow trout  <cit> . there are instances in biological systems that a compound can up-regulate both an enzyme and its inhibitor. for example, the short-chained fatty acid butyrate up-regulated both igf <dig> and igf binding proteins igfbp <dig> and igfbp <dig> in bovine kidney epithelial cells . an alternative explanation to the present observation is that the inhibitor encoded a protein with a function different from that which was annotated due to sequence similarity.

toll-like receptor  <dig> demonstrated significant levels of induction at  <dig> h post-lps treatment. in mammals, tlr <dig> is the extracellular lps receptor whereas tlr <dig> recognizes flagellin  <cit> . the up-regulation of tlr <dig> by gram-negative, virulent edwardsiella ictaluri has been independently observed in channel catfish . this gene was also shown to increase in the liver of atlantic salmon exposed to the bacterium a. salmonicida  <cit> , and in zebrafish exposed to the mycobacterium m. marinum  <cit> . toll-like receptor  <dig> was also included on the catfish microarray, but expression was not significantly altered due to lps exposure. the present data add evidence to the hypothesis that, in fish, microbial products may induce other tlrs than those specific for their own recognition  <cit> .

interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  is one of two dna-binding transcription factors mediating type  <dig> interferon gene expression. in rainbow trout gonadal cells, irf- <dig> is expressed constitutively and up-regulated by poly i:c but not by lps  <cit> . however, microarray experiments using japanese flounder have demonstrated stimulation of irf- <dig> expression in cultured kidney cells after exposure to lps  <cit>  and in kidney tissue after exposure of fish to the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus g protein  <cit> .

apolipoprotein e  has been suggested to have a regulatory role in maintaining a critical balance of various proinflammatory cytokines in mice  <cit>  in addition to its key role in lipid metabolism. expression of apoe decreases in caco- <dig> cells  <dig> h after lps exposure  <cit> , and this was consistent with our observations.

the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> gene selected for analysis by quantitative real-time pcr  was first up-regulated by lps at  <dig> h, rapidly down-regulated at  <dig> h, and remained down-regulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h . a cd14-independent model for lps recognition has been proposed that includes a lps activation cluster complex containing cxcr <dig>  heat shock proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  and growth differentiation factor  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, cxcr <dig> is a functional co-receptor for hiv- <dig> infection of human macrophages. lps down-regulates the expression of cxcr <dig> on monocyte-derived macrophages  <cit> , and the present research is consistent with this observation.

while the majority of the catfish sequences could not be annotated due to sequence identify, several catfish genes could be compared with other fish experiments utilizing microarrays to measure gene expression after experimental infection. the interleukin 1β gene demonstrated the greatest increase in lps-induced expression in catfish spleen, and this gene was highly induced in flounder kidney cells exposed to lps  <cit> . expression of the immune responsive protein  <dig> gene increased in catfish spleen, and bacterially infected salmon kidneys and macrophages  <cit> . catfish mhc class ii gene expression decreased after lps exposure, and this was also observed in mycobacterium-infected zebrafish  <cit>  and salmon macrophage cells exposed to lps  <cit> , but lps-treated flounder kidney cells demonstrated no change in mhc class ii gene expression  <cit> . immunoglobulin gene expression decreased in catfish spleen after lps exposure and in bacterially infected atlantic salmon macrophage cells  <cit> , but it increased in zebrafish after mycobacterial infection  <cit>  and in atlantic salmon liver and kidney after bacterial infection  <cit> . likewise, complement c <dig> gene expression was decreased in catfish spleen and salmon macrophages  <cit> , but increased in kidneys from infected salmon  <cit>  and in infected zebrafish  <cit> . while the present experiment demonstrated similarities and differences in species-specific gene expression after bacterial or lps exposure, the lack of fully annotated sequences on the catfish microarray hindered a more comprehensive comparative analysis. evaluation of immune responses across species would also enhanced by a reference set of microarray probes on each species-specific microarray.

overall, there was no correlation between genes that were more abundant in catfish spleen  and genes that demonstrated significant changes in level of expression after lps stimulation in the present research. while a 2-fold difference in expression is an arbitrary value, there are, undoubtedly, significant physiological and immunological consequences to differences in gene expression less than 2-fold. this differential reflects the inability of current microarray technology to significantly resolve smaller differences in levels of gene expression. the present research exposed difficulties inherent in performing microarray analyses from tissues in vivo. differences observed between individuals within each treatment, due to asynchronized sampling and/or genetic variation, led to averaged effects which could have masked significant responses in some individuals. nonetheless, microarrays are powerful tools that permit the simultaneous screening of thousands of genes to provide candidates for further study. while the current catfish microarray is limited by the large number of "unknown" candidate sequences, both functional experimentation and comparative genomic analyses should help improve and identification of the large number of catfish ests currently without annotation.

from the patterns of gene expression in this experiment, we hypothesize the observed gene expression profiles in lps-stimulated catfish spleen result mainly from macrophage activation by lps. however, contributions from other cell types in spleen cannot be discounted. since macrophages play a key role in a variety of inflammatory diseases and in host defense such as pathogen phagocytosis, antigen presentation to immunocytes, and production of numerous inflammatory mediators, our future work should focus on homogeneous cell populations derived either from cultured cell lines or from macrophages isolated directly from the tissues with techniques such as laser-capture microdissection.

CONCLUSIONS
the oligonucleotide microarray produced in the present research contained genes expressed in seventeen juvenile tissues and all neonatal tissues and provided a platform for global analysis of catfish gene expression. levels of expression measured on the microarray were significantly correlated with levels measured by quantitative rt-pcr. only 38% of the catfish sequences could be presently annotated, but de novo synthesis of oligonucleotides on the platform provides flexibility for adding annotated catfish sequences to the microarray as they become available.

the present experiment focused on the identification of differential gene expression in spleen in response to lps injection. the innate immune response to gram-negative bacteria is influenced by the ability of the host to respond to the lps component, the major virulence factor of these bacteria. the present research identified  <dig> differentially expressed sequences that can provide clues as to the response of the catfish immune system to lps from gram-negative bacteria, and contribute to discerning the nf-κb pathway in teleosts. dissecting the lps signal pathway is important in expanding our knowledge of molecular interactions between invading bacteria and host cells. understanding the difference in the lps pathway between fish and mammalian species will also facilitate understanding of the evolution of innate immune systems. knowledge of the catfish immune system will help researchers identify key pathways in pathogen-induced diseases in catfish.
