BACKGROUND
heat shock protein  <dig>  is essential in all eukaryotes because of its role in chaperoning proteins such as kinases, growth factors and other signal transduction proteins  <cit> . as knock out of hsp- <dig> is generally lethal, specific inhibitors have been important for defining the cellular functions of hsp- <dig>  of these, the best characterised is geldanamycin  a naturally occurring ansamycin compound produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus  <cit> . the mode of action of ga is well documented and the crystal structure of yeast hsp- <dig> complexed to ga has been solved  <cit> . most eukaryotic hsp-90s are susceptible to inhibition with ga and will bind the drug in pull-down assays using ga linked to a solid support  <cit> . the exception to this rule is hsp- <dig>  from the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans , which fails to bind to ga in pull-down assays  <cit>  and which shows no apparent ill-effect when maintained on a lawn of s. hygroscopicus. in contrast ga binds to hsp- <dig> from the parasitic nematode brugia pahangi  and is lethal to all life cycle stages  <cit> . the inability of ce-hsp- <dig> to bind ga was proposed to represent an example of adaptive evolution, as both c. elegans and the streptomyces species that synthesizes ga are soil dwelling and so may share the same ecological niche  <cit> . in this study we adopted an integrated approach to investigating the possibility that nematode hsp-90s may have undergone adaptive evolution that influences ga-binding. we surveyed hsp- <dig> from a range of free-living or parasitic nematodes for their ability to bind ga, and combined these data with statistical methods to compare substitution rates using maximum likelihood  models of codon evolution  <cit> , in an attempt to identify if significant evidence for adaptive diversifying evolution  relating to ga-binding exists. specifically we investigated whether hsp- <dig> from ga-binding nematodes has evolved under differing evolutionary constraints compared to non-ga binding nematode species

nematodes are an extensive group of animals that have evolved to colonise most ecological niches. many nematodes are important parasites of humans, domestic animals and plants and are responsible for considerable economic losses worldwide  <cit> . since the sequencing of the c. elegans genome, the genomes of several additional free-living nematodes have been sequenced, including two other species of caenorhabditis  and pristionchus pacificus  <cit> , a species that associates with beetles. draft genome sequences are available for c. brenneri and japonica, and for the parasitic species trichinella spiralis  <cit> , brugia malayi  <cit> , haemonchus contortus  and meloidogyne hapla  <cit>  and incognita  <cit> , plant parasitic nematodes. furthermore, sequencing projects are planned for several other important parasitic species . in addition est projects have provided an abundance of sequence information on the phylum  <cit> . a phylogeny of the nematodes based on the small subunit ribosomal dna sequences has been proposed  <cit>  in which the nematodes are divided into five clades. each of these clades contain parasitic species, suggesting that parasitism has arisen on multiple occasions during the evolution of the phylum. c. elegans is grouped in clade v, along with many important parasites of veterinary significance, while the filarial nematode brugia malayi lies in clade iii, as do some important ascarid parasites of humans and animals.

while free-living nematodes, such as caenorhabditis species, often exhibit relatively simple life histories developing from egg to adult in one environment, parasitic species display a huge diversity in life cycles. some parasitic species are transmitted direct from host to host and many of these have a free-living stage within the environment , while others, such as the filarial nematodes are obligate parasites. these worms have no free-living stages and are transmitted from host to host by the bite of an infected intermediate host, such as a mosquito. likewise, the clade i species trichinella spiralis is permanently parasitic and transmitted by ingestion of infected tissue. in this study, we set out to investigate whether the life history of a species was correlated with the ability of hsp- <dig> to bind ga by analysing an additional twenty-four species of free-living or parasitic nematode, belonging to four of the five clades. these data were combined with an analysis of hsp- <dig> dna sequences from a range of nematode species, in an attempt to determine whether the hsp- <dig> genes of ga-binding nematodes have significantly different ratios of non-synonomous  to synonomous  nucleotide substitutions compared to non-binding species.

RESULTS
ga pull-down assays
the ability of nematode hsp- <dig> to bind to ga was assessed using a standard pull-down procedure in which ga bound to a solid support was used to select hsp- <dig> from worm extract. the presence of hsp- <dig> in the pull-down was assessed by immuno-blotting. prior to use in pull-down experiments, extracts of each worm were probed with an anti-b. pahangi hsp- <dig> antibody or with ac <dig>  a monoclonal antibody to hsp- <dig>  to confirm that hsp- <dig> could be detected on a blot. extracts of three species failed to react with either antibody over a range of antibody concentrations and exposure times: trichinella spiralis, trichuris muris and anguillicolla crassus. in addition, extracts of adult worms of haemonchus contortus did not react with either antibody, despite the inclusion of hsp- <dig> sequences in the haemonchus est database with reasonable overlap to the 3' end of bp-hsp- <dig> that was used to make the antibody  <cit> . extracts of adult haemonchus were prepared in the presence of an additional protease inhibitor  or directly by boiling in sds-page sample cocktail. only when worms were extracted directly into sample cocktail could hsp- <dig> be detected, suggesting that the aqueous extract may be subject to proteolytic degradation. in contrast, a soluble extract of the l <dig> stage reacted well with the brugia antibody and was used in subsequent pull-down assays.

nine clade v nematodes were tested in the ga pull-down assay, five of which were free-living. these included c. elegans n <dig>  c. elegans jt <dig>  a daf- <dig> mutant which carries a point mutation in hsp- <dig> , conferring a temperature-sensitive dauer-constitutive phenotype  <cit> , caenorhabditis briggsae , oscheia tipulae and pristionchus pacificus. in addition four parasitic species were tested: teladorsagia circumcincta, nippostrongylus brasilensis, heligmosomoides polygyrus and h. contortus. hsp- <dig> from all clade v species reacted positively with the anti-brugia hsp- <dig> antibody , but none bound to ga in the pull-down assay, whether from free-living or parasitic species . blots were exposed for extended periods of time but no positive reaction was observed, while the control b. pahangi lysate always yielded a strong positive result. a similar picture was observed with clade iv species, where hsp- <dig> from strongyloides ratti, two species of the plant parasite globodera and the free-living panagrellus redivivus all failed to bind ga . for clade iii nematodes, the situation was more diverse with hsp- <dig> from all five filarial worms tested b. pahangi, acanthocheilonema viteae, dirofilaria immitis, onchocerca ochengi and litomosoides sigmondontis  binding to ga . hsp- <dig> from three ascarid species  also bound to ga, but hsp- <dig> from the related anisakids  did not  while a. crassus failed to react with either antibody . where a positive signal was obtained in the pull-down assay, experiments were repeated in the presence of excess ga to block free binding sites. in all cases free ga blocked binding of hsp- <dig> to the ga beads demonstrating the specificity of the interaction .

two species belonging to clade i were tested, t. muris and t. spiralis but neither reacted with the anti-hsp- <dig> antibodies. for these species and for a. crassus, ga pull-down assays were analysed by coomassie blue staining. for t. spiralis only, the ga pull-down assay revealed a band of approximately  <dig> kda that was not present using control beads. the binding to ga beads of the protein isolated from the t. spiralis extract was competed by pre-incubation of the extract with excess free ga. the band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin and subjected to mass spectrometry at the sir henry wellcome functional genomics unit, university of glasgow. mascot searches revealed multiple peptide hits to hsp- <dig> from a variety of species with a high degree of significance . thus t. spiralis hsp- <dig> binds to ga, while the ga-binding status of a. crassus and t. muris hsp- <dig> remains uncertain. table  <dig> summarises the data from the ga pull-down experiments.

bioinformatic analysis of nematode hsp-90s
hsp- <dig> sequences from a variety of ga-binding and non-binding species of nematode were either retrieved from public databases or were cloned and sequenced as described in methods. an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences is given in supplementary data  and highlights the degree of conservation of hsp- <dig>  particularly over the n-terminal atp-binding domain. table  <dig> shows the pairwise similarity and identity between sequences used in the bioinformatic analyses described below. full genomic and cdna sequences were available for six species, c. elegans, c. briggsae, p. pacificus, h. contortus, b. pahangi, and t. spiralis allowing the comparison of hsp- <dig> gene structure between the different species. exon-intron boundaries were mapped by comparison of genomic and cdna sequences and are shown graphically . three introns are present in c. elegans and c. briggsae and the position of each is conserved. these are also perfectly conserved with those of h. contortus , although here the hc-hsp- <dig> gene contains a total of eight introns. b. pahangi contains the largest numbers of introns , the position of three of which are conserved with h. contortus. a single intron  is conserved in five of the six species analysed, the exception being t. spiralis.

identifying sites and lineages subject to adaptive evolution
for the gene-wide analysis, using either set of nested models of codon evolution  did not identify any evidence of positive selection that was consistent across the phylogenetic tree . however, using the branch-sites methods which allow evolutionary rates to vary across the tree did show some interesting findings. three branches showed significant evidence of adaptive evolution  after bonferroni correction . along each of these branches, sites were detected with posterior probabilities >  <dig>  of belonging to a dn/ds >  <dig> class . along branch a  a single site 659s was identified . on branch b , three sites with dn/ds >  <dig>  297s, 373s and 464s, were detected. on branch c, nine sites were detected 21s, 29s, 165v, 312s, 458s, 472q, 485a, 525s and 584s. importantly ten of these thirteen sites are serine residues which when examined are perfectly or largely conserved across all species in the alignment . the identification of these ten sites as dn/ds >  <dig> results from the serine being encoded by either codons tcn or agy. as the codon model of evolution assumes that mutations within a codon are independent, the change from tcn-agy is parsimoniously interpreted as two separate non-synonymous substitutions : e.g. tcc ->acc ->agc . the biological interpretation of these results suggests that the conservation of serine at these positions is functionally important and that this may be evidence for divergent evolution with rapid convergence back to the functionally stable serine residue. however, this cannot be proven by comparison of the extant species available to us and these sites are not considered further here. the remaining codons 165v, 472q and 485a are inferred to be evolving rapidly along the lineage separating the plant parasitic nematodes from the animal parasitic and free-living species studied . site 472q is located in the middle region of the hsp- <dig> protein and the codon is a conserved cysteine in the four plant parasitic nematodes and glutamine in all other species tested. site 485a is also located in the middle region of the protein and is glutamine in the plant parasitic species and alanine in all other species. only a single site, 165v, is predicted to be evolving under positive selection and is also located in the n terminal ga binding region of hsp- <dig>  site 165v is a valine residue in the ga-binding species  but also in the non-ga binding p. pacificus and h. contortus. the residue is a phenylalanine in c. elegans and tyrosine in other caenorhabditids analysed. to determine if these initial findings are consistent with the theory that ga-binding is associated with rapid diversifying evolution of the hsp- <dig> gene, we used a modified branch-site approach  <cit>  to a priori separate the phylogenetic tree into two groups, ga-binders  vs non-ga-binders. repeating the branch-sites analysis failed to provide significant evidence to suggest that an elevated dn/ds ratio associated with adaptive evolution was present in either of the two groups .

the clade iii nematodes analysed produced an interesting dichotomy in results, containing both ga-binding and non-binding species. hsp- <dig> from the five filarial parasites assayed bound to ga; filarial worms are obligate parasites, transmitted between hosts by the bite of an infected intermediate host, such as mosquitoes or other arthropods. in keeping with this result, hsp- <dig> from another obligate parasite t. spiralis also bound ga. t. spiralis is a clade i species commonly transmitted via ingestion of infected muscle containing the encysted l <dig> stages. thus neither filarial worms nor t. spiralis have free-living stages in the environment.

the clade iii ascarid parasites also provided an intriguing comparison, as those worms which bound ga  all have free-living stages outside the host, but are enclosed within a thick impermeable egg-shell while in the environment. transmission to the new host is by ingestion of the egg containing the infective larva or via a paratenic host . interestingly, in the original report on the isolation of ga  <cit> , the in vivo efficacy of ga against the mouse pinworm syphacia obvelata is recorded, suggesting that this parasite may also express a ga-binding hsp- <dig>  in keeping with this observation, pinworms belong to clade iii  and are transmitted by ingestion of a resistant egg containing the infective larval stage.

two of the three clade iii species associated with the marine environment  failed to bind ga. both parasites have complex life cycles involving one or more intermediate and/or paratenic hosts. the free-living larval stages are ingested by marine crustaceans, which are then eaten by fish, which are subsequently ingested by marine mammals such as seals  or cetaceans . a. crassus belongs to the superfamily dracunuloidea and parasitises the swim bladder of eels, but also has a free-swimming larval stage. as extracts of a. crassus  failed to react with either antibody, the ga-binding status of these species remains unresolved. an additional proviso of our data is that in some cases, larval stages were analysed and it is possible that larval and adult worms may display different ga-binding characteristics.

our data suggest that differences in the ability of nematode hsp- <dig> to bind to ga are correlated with particular life histories. only obligate parasites or those which have free-living stages in the environment enclosed within a protective egg-shell possess a ga-binding hsp- <dig>  while hsp- <dig> from free-living nematodes or from those parasitic species that have free-living larval stages in the environment do not bind ga. the adaptive evolution hypothesis would argue that organisms sharing the same niche as the ga-producing streptomyces should fail to bind ga and the results from the pull-down experiments broadly support this hypothesis. in order to further explore this theory, we analysed hsp- <dig> sequences from fifteen different species of nematode in an attempt to identify codons that have undergone adaptive darwinian evolution within the ga-resistant species. the results of these analyses provided strong evidence for rapid adaptive evolution along three separate lineages and identified a number of residues showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution. however, the model suggests that ten of the thirteen codons identified as sites of adaptive evolution had undergone at least two separate non-synonomous substitutions resulting in the conservation of a serine residue, implying that these sites may be critical for hsp <dig> function. in mammalian hsp-90α and β, both serine and threonine residues are known to be targets of phosphorylation  <cit> , a modification that is essential for some functions of hsp- <dig>  <cit> . of the remaining three residues  showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution , only a single site, 165v, was located in the amino terminal section of the hsp- <dig> protein, known to be the position of ga binding. however, variation at this site does not differentiate between ga-binding and non-ga binding species. the residue is a valine in the ga binding species, but also in the non-ga binding species p. pacificus and h. contortus. comparison of the amino acid sequences of hsp- <dig> from ga-binding species and non-binding species identified only four amino acid positions that are conserved within either the ga-binding or the non-binding species, but that differ between the groups. these are: k <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , v <dig>  . however, none of these substitutions reside in the n terminal region. comparison of each of these positions in brugia and saccharomyces cerevisiae, which binds ga  <cit> , shows that the equivalent amino acids in yeast are conserved with the non-ga-binding nematode species. thus whilst evidence for rapid diversifying selection exists in the evolution of the hsp- <dig> gene  and most likely occurred early in nematode divergence, we have been unable to prove with confidence that the selection seen correlates with a change in the ga-binding function of hsp- <dig>  as hsp- <dig> is a multi-functional protein in eukaryotic cells, the observed rapid evolution of the hsp- <dig> gene likely correlates with some other key function, rather than the ability to bind ga.

in s. cerevisiae, point mutations in hsp- <dig> alter the sensitivity to ga and to radicicol, an alternative inhibitor of hsp- <dig> function  <cit> ; e.g. a587t and t101i are hypersensitive to ga, with t22i, g313s and e381k showing a lesser effect. however, additional factors are also known to influence sensitivity to ga in yeast, including the presence of co-chaperones such as sti1p  and sba1p . yeast deficient in sti1p or sba1p show increased sensitivity to ga  <cit> . c. elegans expresses homologues of both co-chaperones  <cit>  and a recent study identified sti- <dig> as an hsp- <dig> interacting protein in c. elegans  <cit> . however, whether sti- <dig> null animals have an altered response to ga has yet to be explored.

while analysis of daf- <dig> mutants and rnai studies in c. elegans clearly show that hsp- <dig> is essential in the worm, c. elegans is not susceptible to ga and, indeed, in the micro-environment of a petri dish, can grow perfectly well when fed on a culture of s. hygroscopicus  <cit> . however, it remains unclear whether c. elegans would interact with the ga-producing s. hygroscopicus in the environment. although both organisms may be present in the soil, whether they share the same spatial and temporal niches is unknown. indeed, the ecology of c. elegans in the wild is not well understood, despite its extensive use in the laboratory  <cit> . although c. elegans can be found in soil, it appears that the predominant stage observed in the wild is the dauer larvae, typically found in organic-rich environments such as compost, or in association with invertebrates such as snails and isopods  <cit> . dauer stages are resistant and non-feeding and the natural food source of c. elegans in the wild is unknown. c. elegans possesses a sensitive chemosensory system that, at least in the laboratory setting, allows the worm to differentiate between bacterial food sources and potential pathogens  <cit> . thus in the environment, worms could potentially avoid bacteria producing noxious compounds.

many hsp <dig> inhibitors are natural compounds produced by micro-organisms and recent studies have provided an intriguing insight into the mechanisms by which the organisms that produce hsp <dig> inhibitors can themselves survive. for example, in the yeast humicola fuscoatra, which produces radicicol, a single conserved amino acid substitution  in hsp- <dig>  is sufficient to alter the binding of radicicol, without influencing the ability to bind atp or ga  <cit> . here, a leucine to isoleucine substitution alters the size of the hydrophobic drug-binding pocket increasing the binding of h2o molecules and hydration of the drug. such findings serve to emphasise that very subtle alterations in amino acid residues can have major implications on drug binding efficacy and highlight the importance of understanding the structural basis of drug binding, which is not always apparent from analysis of dna sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that c. elegans hsp- <dig> is not unique in its low affinity for ga; despite a relatively high level of sequence conservation, nematode hsp-90s show functional diversity in relation to ga-binding. the ability to bind to ga is associated with the life history of a species; free-living nematodes and those parasitic species which have a free-living larval stage in the environment do not bind ga, while obligate parasites or those parasitic species which have free-living stages enclosed within a resistant egg, do bind ga. as s. hygroscopicus, the micro-organism that synthesizes ga, is found in soil, and as hsp- <dig> is an essential molecule in all eukaryotes, these observations could be consistent with adaptive evolution of hsp- <dig> sequences. analysis of hsp- <dig> sequences from fifteen different nematode species provided evidence of rapid diversifying selection along three separate branches. however, the selection observed did not correlate with the ability to bind ga or not.
