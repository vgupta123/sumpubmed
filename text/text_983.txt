BACKGROUND
assessing gene flow is essential for any study of speciation or local adaptation, as gene flow is a force counteracting those processes. classic models of population genetics consider the source of genetic differentiation between populations  to result either from an equilibrium between migration and drift  or from drift since the time of divergence . thus, population geneticists would estimate migration rates  <cit>  or time of divergence  <cit>  from fst based on their  opinion or other non-genetic evidence that their study system fitted best to one of the two alternative models. the first attempt to distinguish between both scenarios using genetic data was made by wakeley  <cit> , who noted that the variance of pairwise differences was expected to be higher under the migration model and proposed a test statistic based on this prediction. however, a test based on the variance of pairwise differences shows low power  <cit> , is highly influenced by recombination, and has seen only limited implementation. a significant advance was the development of likelihood-based methods under the isolation-with-migration model e.g.  <cit> . in this approach, the model consists of two populations that diverge from an ancestral population and exchange migrants, and the values of these parameters  are inferred. this is currently the most widely used method to study genetic differentiation between a pair of populations or species  and is implemented in ima  <cit> . the model implemented in ima assumes the absence of intragenic recombination and the violation of this assumption can produce substantial bias in the estimates from this analysis  <cit> . a framework to specifically analyse recombining genes is essential as nuclear genes, which are widely used in studies related to divergence and speciation, are subject to recombination. in order to overcome this limitation, likelihood-free methods have also been considered e.g.  <cit> , in which data are summarized by a set of statistics, and the likelihood is approximated by a distance metric between the observed summary statistics and summary statistics simulated from the model. thus, loci with intragenic recombination can be simulated under the isolation-with-migration model to approximate the likelihood of the parameter values. similarly, other recent approaches based on summary statistic or the site frequency spectrum e.g.  <cit> , use coalescent simulations with recombination to account for linkage among markers. recombination generates different linkage disequilibrium patterns depending upon the presence or absence of gene flow ; so genes with recombination potentially provide additional information about genetic exchange. however, because these approximate-likelihood methods reduce the data to a set of summary statistics, information on linkage disequilibrium between polymorphic sites is usually lost , and any additional information provided by intragenic recombination cannot be exploited. among the latest related statistical developments, it is worth noting the pac-likelihood  method  <cit>  and a method based on shared haplotype lengths  <cit> , both of which explicitly exploit the spatial arrangement of polymorphism within sequences to make inferences under the isolation-with-migration model.

in this work we propose summary statistics that contain information about the presence and direction of gene flow as a result of intragenic recombination, and we describe their properties in the form of statistical tests for the detection of gene flow . in order to provide an empirical example, these statistics were calculated in a sample of eleven loci sequenced from populations of the drosophila simulans species complex , which is one of the most documented models used for speciation and evolution  <cit> . the generalist d. simulans, which probably evolved on madagascar  <cit> , has recently extended its distribution globally, is now a semi-domestic species, exhibiting strong genetic differentiation between ancestral and derived populations  <cit> . in contrast, the endemic d. sechellia, confined to the seychelles archipelago, presents all the characteristics of a island-syndrome species, being strictly specialized on the ripe fruit of the otherwise toxic morinda citrifolia <cit> , with low reproductive output  <cit>  and presenting limited genetic diversity  <cit> . despite its fragmented distribution, d. sechellia does not exhibit strong population structure  <cit> , but rather a local pattern of genetic exchange between neighboring islands  <cit> . these features strongly contrast with those of its sister species, the island endemic d. mauritiana, which is geographically and genetically highly structured into two populations: the expanding population of mauritius island and the population of rodrigues island, 600 km to the east of mauritius, which is smaller and at equilibrium  <cit> . interestingly, d. simulans, d. sechellia and d. mauritiana are incompletely reproductively isolated, and can produce fertile female f <dig> hybrids   <cit> . however, the question of interspecific hybridization in nature, and its frequency, is unresolved. the existence of shared polymorphisms between these species may thus result from introgression due to secondary contact, but could also be due to ancestral polymorphism shared among these recently diverged species.

RESULTS
spatial arrangement of polymorphism with recombination and gene flow
the segregating sites from a sample of sequences taken from two populations can be divided into four categories  <cit>  : shared polymorphic sites , which are polymorphic in both populations; fixed polymorphic sites , which are fixed differences between the two populations ; exclusive polymorphic sites of population p <dig> , which are sites polymorphic in population p <dig> and monomorphic in population p2; and exclusive polymorphic sites of population p <dig> .

in order to illustrate the problem at hand, we will consider two extreme models: the isolation  and the migration  models. in the case of the isolation model, the origin of s sites are polymorphisms from the ancestral population that have survived drift in both populations since the time of divergence, a process often referred to as incomplete lineage sorting e.g.  <cit> . in the case of the migration model, shared polymorphism is caused by  exchange of alleles between the populations. it has been argued  <cit>  that s sites had more time to recombine with other sites under the isolation model than under the migration model, and, therefore, stronger linkage disequilibrium  between s sites within each population was expected with the presence of gene flow. however, a preliminary study found that classical measures of ld have little power for the detection of gene flow. while recent gene exchange leaves little time for recombination to act it also leaves little time for  allele frequencies to increase. since ld measures are very sensitive to allele frequencies, detecting a significant association between rare migrant alleles is challenging . in summary, there are two balanced effects: introgressed alleles may lead to greater ld because they are recent, leaving little time for recombination to occur, however they also tend to be rare, which does not favour high ld values. note, however, that ld measures might be used to detect admixture  <cit> , i.e. a population originating from the mixture of individuals from different populations, because the targeted pattern is not expected to be overly influenced by low allele frequencies.

here we argue that gene flow creates some patterns of ld distinct from those created under the isolation model  and which require non-standard measures of ld to reveal them. in the migration model, the fate of a migrant chromosome is to be fragmented by recombination into “introgression blocks”, i.e. segments of dna of migrant ancestry and untouched by recombination since the migration event . some introgression blocks may be lost by drift, while others may persist. figure  <dig> represents a simplified genealogy with migration and recombination  and a resulting introgression block . a set of aligned sequences can be divided into segments delimited by the recombination breakpoints . a segment of the alignment containing an introgression block may contain shared polymorphisms but will rarely contain any fixed difference . conversely, a segment of the alignment that does not contain any introgression blocks may contain f sites  but cannot contain s and f sites together . therefore, f and s sites along the alignment are expected to be segregated into a small number of groups.

an alignment can be summarized as a sequence that represents the order of the different categories of polymorphic sites . we expected the order of elements in this sequence to depart more drastically from randomness in models with migration. the runs test  <cit>  is a statistical test for the randomness in the order of elements of two categories along a sequence. a run is defined as a maximal segment of consecutive elements of the same type . a low number of runs  within a sequence indicates that identical elements appear in clusters along the sequence . ideally, we would like to apply the test to the sequence of f and s sites, but it is unlikely that both types of sites are present in the same dna alignment for a large set of parameter values combinations . therefore, we considered the sequence with the four categories of sites  and pooled categories of sites, reducing them in two categories. two combinations were considered: f sites vs. s, x <dig> and x <dig>  and s sites vs. f, x <dig> and x <dig> . since f and s sites are not often found together, this approach allows testing for either the clustering of f sites  or s sites , whichever are found in the alignment. we predict that values of run statistics  will be lower under models with migration than under models of pure divergence.

pseudo-data generated by coalescent simulations confirmed our prediction for the rf statistic. scenarios with migration resulted in low rf values, indicating segregation between fixed differences and exclusive  polymorphisms along the alignment. however, the behaviour of the rf statistic is highly dependent on the differentiation between the two populations, requiring high differentiation  to observe a difference between models with and without migration . from d >  <dig>  power starts to decrease, which is expected as highly differentiated populations are connected by migration events that are distantly spaced in time, so recombination has time to break up associations between alleles. the proportion of false positives  under the isolation model remains around the nominal value  for any d value . the distinct behaviour of the rf statistic under the isolation model and the models with migration indicates that it can be used to tackle the problem in hand under a large range of conditions. nevertheless, a minimum recombination rate  is required for the segregation between f and x sites, and the signal for this segregation becomes stronger with increasing recombination rate . in theory, it should start to decrease with recombination at some point , but this was not observed in the range of recombination rates that could be assessed in practice. in contrast with the results for rf, the detection of migration using the clustering of shared polymorphisms  was unsuccessful . examining the actual rs values  reveals that highly differentiated populations  connected with migration do present clusters of shared polymorphisms , but divergent populations do not maintain ancestral polymorphisms at such levels of differentiation. however, shared polymorphisms in populations with lower levels of divergence have a stronger clustering of s sites than models with migration. intuitively, we can expect that low divergence times still retain some clustering of s sites in the isolation model. this is because there has not been enough time for recombination to disrupt allele association, while the presence of high gene flow causes a constant introduction of migrant haplotypes affecting the whole region of the alignment . given the different behaviour  of the rs statistic for the different models, it may be still useful to distinguish the models in another inferential context .

spatial arrangement of polymorphism with recombination and unidirectional gene flow
additional categories of segregating sites can be defined if we consider the distribution of the ancestral and derived alleles between the populations  <cit> . in practice, the ancestral or derived status of alleles is inferred by the use of an outgroup . fixed differences  can then be further separated into f <dig> sites, where the derived allele is fixed in p <dig>  and f <dig> sites, where the derived allele is fixed in p <dig>  among the exclusive polymorphisms of p <dig> , we can define the category f2x <dig> for cases where the derived state is fixed in p <dig>  that contains only four types of variable site category: f <dig>  f <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> . after a migration event from p <dig> into p <dig>  an introgression block is introduced into the stretch of alignment considered. thus, all f <dig> sites become f2x <dig> and all f <dig> sites become x <dig>  some x <dig> sites may remain x <dig>  while others may become s sites . those shared polymorphisms will often belong to category s <dig>  because the mutation is older than the migration event and thus, had more time to increase in frequency in p <dig> than in p <dig>  therefore, migration from p <dig> to p <dig> will tend to produce clusters of x <dig>  f2x <dig> and s <dig> , while x <dig> sites will be present along the entire alignment, both within the stretch containing introgression blocks, and outside them. conversely, migration from p <dig> to p <dig> will produce clusters of x <dig>  f1x <dig> and s <dig>  with x <dig> sites distributed along the entire alignment. lastly, migration in both directions will produce both types of clusters.

as proposed above, an alignment can be summarized as a sequence that represents the order of the different categories of polymorphic sites . this time, our objective is to independently detect  clusters of x <dig>  f1x <dig> and s <dig> sites, and  clusters of x <dig>  f2x <dig> and s <dig> sites within the alignment . in order to test such patterns we will focus on the w statistic  <cit>  which can be used to test for a uniform distribution of the division of a continuous interval into sub-intervals, i.e. the random position  of breaks on the continuous interval. the w statistic was modified for the discrete case in ref  <cit> , in order to be able to apply it to molecular sequences. in contrast with the previous r statistic, the modified w statistic is based on the length of the sub-intervals from sites of a given category  delimited by the positions of the sites of the other category : w= <dig> ∑i=1d+1lik-2-1d+ <dig> where k is the total number of variable sites in the summary sequence, d is the number of sites assigned to category  <dig> and li is the length of the ith sub-interval . thus, the category  <dig> is used to define the segment and the w statistic is sensitive to the randomness of the distribution of 1’s. this is an important characteristic of this statistic as it will allow testing for the randomness of one category of site regardless of the other category being distributed randomly or not . the w statistic will take large values when the ‘breaks’ are clustered and low values when the ‘breaks’ are evenly spaced. this statistic can be applied to our problem by coding the alignment in two ways:  x <dig>  f2x <dig> and s <dig> sites as ‘breaks’ , while x <dig>  f1x <dig> and s <dig> define the segment   and  x <dig>  f1x <dig> and s <dig> sites as ‘breaks’ , while x <dig>  f2x <dig> and s <dig> define the segment  . preliminary work on a variant of the w statistic including fixed differences yielded similar results . it will thus not be presented in this work. we predict that the presence of migration from p <dig> to p <dig>  will produce larger values in the statistic wx1s <dig> than scenarios without migration from p <dig> to p <dig> . note that direction of migration is always indicated forward in time throughout the text, including for coalescent simulations.

in the simulations, models with populations connected only by migration  were detected at all differentiation levels, though the power was higher with higher levels of genetic differentiation . unlike the rf statistic, a minimum recombination rate is not necessary and the simulations without recombination show some  power to detect directional migration . this might be due to a pattern produced by an asymmetry in the populations since higher polymorphism in the sink population than in the source population is expected. still, recombination plays an important role for this statistic since its power increases with recombination. it is interesting to note that the presence of s sites for the highest differentiation levels considered was very low or null. therefore, the values of the wx1s <dig> statistic depend only on the distribution of x <dig> and x <dig> sites and the orientation of the mutations is not required.

the false positive rate was near, or below, the expected nominal level  as neither the isolation nor the unidirectional migration from p <dig> to p <dig> produced any significant clustering of x <dig> and s <dig> sites . however, as noted above, the wx1s <dig> statistic seems to be affected by asymmetries of the model other than the gene flow. further simulations with unequal population sizes and gene flow from the small to the large populations show an extremely high false positive rate when the isolation model with equal population sizes is assumed as null model. on the other hand, when gene flow is from the large population to the small one the test is conservative but has virtually no power . the difference in population sizes increases the differences in polymorphism between both populations, resulting in unbalanced number of x <dig> and x <dig> sites that probably affects the w statistics. these problems can be partially solved by using the isolation model with unequal population sizes as null model . by doing so, false positives from simulations without any gene flow remain at the nominal level . however, signal for direction of migration is lost since, as simulations with gene flow from p <dig> to p <dig> show no significant wx1s <dig> values while simulation with gene flow from p <dig> to p <dig> yield significant wx1s <dig> values . these results indicate that it is difficult to disentangle the effect of unidirectional gene flow from those of unequal population sizes with our test-based approach. however, more positively, w statistics can still offer some evidence for migration if not for their direction.

detection of migration within the drosophila simulans species complex
the statistics rf, wx1s <dig> and wx2s <dig> were calculated for a d. simulans complex dataset , with the aim of testing for gene flow, and assessing direction, between these closely related species. in all pairwise comparisons, the two populations of d. mauritiana were considered separately because of their high differentiation  <cit> , and intraspecific comparisons were done for this species. table  <dig> gives estimates of the mutation and recombination parameters for each locus and each species. for all loci, d. simulans showed the highest estimates for both parameters, the estimates were much lower for d. sechellia and intermediate values were found for the two populations of d. mauritiana. compared to the parameters used in the simulations we can see that the estimated rate of recombination is high enough  to provide some power for the detection of gene flow with the statistics proposed in this work . for d. simulans and d. mauritiana, scaled mutation rate estimates are also of the same order of magnitude as for the simulations, but not for d. sechellia which shows a much smaller effective size. the level of genetic differentiation, d, is presented for each locus and each pairwise comparison of species in table  <dig> and populations in table  <dig>

we found some evidence, though not definitive, for migration between d. simulans and its two sister species. the rf statistic was significant for two loci  for the d. simulans/d. mauritiana from mauritius island  pair; for two loci  for the d. simulans/d. mauritiana from rodrigues island  pair; and for one locus  for the d. simulans/d. sechellia pair. additional support came from the w statistic : the two loci had significant wx2s <dig> values for the d. simulans/rod pair. our results, based on the spatial arrangement of polymorphisms, are consistent with a genome-wide comparison of one individual from d. simulans, d. sechellia and d. mauritiana, which shows that both autosomal and x-linked regions present a signal consistent with recent introgressions between d. simulans and the two endemic species  <cit> . other studies based on smaller genomic regions have revealed that introgression was likely to have occured between d. simulans and mau both at the mitochondrial and at the nuclear level  <cit> , but our analyses are the first to suggest that introgression may also have occurred between d. simulans and rod. d. simulans is absent from both mauritius and rodrigues although very common in the neighbouring island of la réunion . thus, recent introgression may have two non-exclusive origins:  d. simulans was present on mauritius and rodrigues and recently disappeared and  in the recent past, d. simulans arrived to both islands through human activities, fruit dispersal or climatic factors. the latter scenario opens the possibility that the d. mauritiana gene pool may have absorbed occasional or regular waves of d. simulans dispersers, without the stable presence of a separate d. simulans population on mauritius. notice that the shared history of the two mauritiana taxa  <cit>  can also explain the presence of simulans-like alleles in rod as a consequence of introgression from d. simulans into mau that occurred before the split of the two d. mauritiana populations about  <dig>  years ago. the situation between d. simulans and d. sechellia is different because the two species coexist on the seychelles archipelago, and a few morphological hybrids of d. simulans-d. sechellia have been observed .

the intraspecific comparison of the two populations of d. mauritiana  cannot benefit from the information provided by rf statistic since the absence of fixed differences prevents its calculation. however, one of eleven wx2s <dig> statistics was significant, and two of eleven wx1s <dig> were significant, which provides some evidence that points towards the presence of gene flow. likelihood-based inferences under the isolation with migration model have previously suggested the presence of limited gene flow from mau to rod  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this works confirms the prediction that the spatial arrangement of polymorphisms along a recombining stretch of a genome is affected by the presence and direction of gene flow. two summary statistics are described that are sensitive to the spatial clustering of polymorphic sites generated by gene flow, and which can be used in a test to reject the isolation model as null hypothesis. a third statistic is described that has a distinct behaviour in the presence of migration, but that was not adequate for the test-based approach described in this work. the interest of these statistics is that they are applicable to datasets with characteristics that prevent their analysis with current available programs such as im  <cit> , because of the presence of intragenic recombination, or mimar  <cit> , because of the absence of fixed differences and shared polymorphisms at the same time. however, these statistics should not be seen as a substitution of those methods but rather as a complement. they allow the extraction of information from data that derives from linkage disequilibrium among alleles from recombining loci. this is information that is usually lost when ima is applied to short sequences  or in likelihood-free methods  that do not use heavy computing ld summary statistics. these statistics can be applied to an entire dataset as a previous step before applying ima to a reduced dataset. they may also be useful as summary statistics in the abc framework; like the variance of pairwise differences that have low power when applied as a test  <cit>  but have proved useful for abc  <cit> .

another advantage of the statistics described in this work is that genotypes do not need to be phased nor individual genotypes identified, because the statistics depend only on the spatial location of sites not on the allelic identity of individuals. unphased sequence data or sequence data from pooled samples of several individuals  should be as informative as phased resequencing data . another advantage is that knowledge of allele frequencies or the ancestral state is not necessary . this could be particularly helpful for the study of next generation sequencing data derived from pooled individuals e.g.  <cit> , where the number of individuals sequenced at each polymorphic site and each allelic state is unknown and methods based on the pac-likelihood or the length of shared haplotypes cannot be applied. as long as the coverage of the sequencing is enough to determine whether the site is polymorphic in each population, r and w statistics may be calculated.

the application of these statistics to the species of the d. simulans complex was illustrative. although the high recombination rates  make it an especially favourable case study for the application of these summary statistics, the results were not as compelling as they could have been. the results suggest genetic exchange between species and also between populations, that is, in the absence of any fixed differences. this conclusion is also supported by several independent studies on this system. the confirmation of the presence of gene flow is an important key for the understanding of the evolution of these species. however, we could not ascertain the presence and direction of migration due to limited power of our statistics in case of unequal population sizes. resolving issue will be a major step toward a better comprehension of the evolutionary history of the simulans complex.
