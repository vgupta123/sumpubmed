BACKGROUND
ischaemia/reoxygenation of the heart induces apoptosis and necrosis  <cit> ; however, the actual contribution of these two forms of cell death to ischaemia/reoxygenation injury and their time-course have not been established in the human myocardium and remains controversial in experimental animal models. kajstura et al  <cit>  have reported that apoptosis begins in rat ischaemic myocardium either after a prolonged period of permanent ischaemia or during a much shorter period of ischaemia followed by reperfusion whereas others  <cit>  have shown that although apoptosis may be initiated during ischaemia, its detection is increased and may well be accelerated during reperfusion. on the other hand, studies in a dog model of coronary artery ligation have shown that necrosis, quantified histologically, develops rapidly after ischaemia and is directly proportional to the ischaemic time  <cit> , although, there is evidence in the literature suggesting that necrosis may also result secondary to reperfusion injury  <cit> . furthermore, it has also been suggested that apoptosis may switch to necrosis below certain critical levels of atp  <cit> .

the mechanisms of ischaemia/reoxygenation injury have been extensively investigated, however its pathophysiology is complex and the involvement and importance of various pathways such as the caspases remains unclear.

the aims of the present studies were:  to investigate the degree and the time-course of apoptosis and necrosis sustained during ischaemia and reoxygenation of the human myocardium and  to examine the role of caspase activation. here we have demonstrated that the type of cell death induced by simulated ischaemia/reoxygenation of the human myocardium depends on the ischaemic insult with apoptosis happening early during reoxygenation and necrosis becoming more important later. in addition, the present studies have shown the apoptosis induced by simulated ischaemia/reoxygenation is mainly mediated by activation of caspace- <dig> but that it does not affect necrosis.

discussion
the present studies have demonstrated that, depending on the ischaemic insult, apoptosis may be the predominant form of cell death in the human myocardium during the first  <dig> hours of reoxygenation, so that apoptosis is more important than necrosis when the ischaemic period is â‰¤  <dig> minutes but the reverse is true after  <dig> minutes of ischaemia; however, by  <dig> hours of reperfusion cell death by apoptosis has subsided and necrosis, that also depends on the degree of ischaemia, becomes the leading cause of cell death. the implications of these findings for the understanding of the pathophysiology of ischaemia/reoxygenation injury are discussed below.

effect of the degree of ischaemic injury and the duration of reoxygenation on the type of cell death
our study is the first to report on the time-course of cell death by apoptosis and necrosis induced by ischaemia and reoxygenation of the human myocardium. the demonstration that apoptosis follows a bell-shaped profile, increasing with the duration of ischaemia up to  <dig> minutes and then decreasing by  <dig> minutes of ischaemia, is novel. previous experimental studies could not show this response because they used limited time-periods of ischaemia  <cit> . the finding that apoptosis increases with the duration of reoxygenation from  <dig> to  <dig> hours is supported by observations in the dog heart subjected to  <dig> minutes of ischaemia and reperfused for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours  <cit> . however, whilst our study showed a decline in apoptosis when the myocardium was reoxygenated for  <dig> hours, the latter study  <cit>  reported a progressive increase in apoptosis over the  <dig> hours of reperfusion. the reason for the differing results of the two studies is unclear but the use of different species  and experimental preparations  may be, at least in part, responsible.

the present studies have also shown that, as expected, the degree of cell death by necrosis is directly proportional to the severity of ischaemia. but, in addition, they have demonstrated that necrosis gradually increases with the duration of reoxygenation, which is consistent with the observation that necrosis is a dynamic process that continues over a period of at least  <dig> hours of reperfusion  <cit> . it should be mentioned, however, that the degree of tissue injury as assessed by the reduction of mtt was not increased with the duration of reoxygenation. this apparent contradiction between the results obtained with the propidium iodide staining and mtt reduction is not clear, but it is possible that while the former reflects the extent of necrosis alone, the latter may represent other forms of cell death. the lack of agreement of these two assays highlights the importance of using more than one index to assess tissue injury.

role of caspase activation on ischaemia/reoxygenation-induced cell death
the similar mean values of total caspase activity seen after all studied ischaemic and reoxygenation periods may suggest that this pathway may not be an important mechanism of cell death in the human myocardium or, more likely, that only specific caspases may take part in this process, the changes of which may not be of sufficient magnitude to significantly alter the whole pool of caspases. our finding that caspase- <dig> activity is increased by the degree of ischaemic insult would support the latter hypo-thesis. the rapid dissipation of caspase- <dig> activity with the extension of the reoxygenation period suggests that this enzyme may be activated for a limited time period and that, therefore, the time points investigated in our studies do not provide a complete time-course of changes in enzyme activity. a participation of caspases in apoptosis has also been observed in experimental animal studies  <cit> , with elevation of caspase- <dig> activity during the early reperfusion period  <cit> . it is of interest to note that in the present studies total caspase activity, but not caspase- <dig> activity, was elevated in fresh tissue, a finding that may be explained by the handling and mechanical injury sustained during the sectioning of the muscle.

the almost complete abolition of apoptosis by the specific caspase- <dig> inhibitor z.devd.fmk seen in our studies demonstrates that the induction of apoptosis by ischaemia/reoxygenation in the human myocardium is caspase- <dig> dependent. this finding in man is supported by in vitro and in vivo animal experimental studies  <cit>  in which caspase- <dig> inhibition attenuated apoptosis and reduced reperfusion injury, all suggesting that caspase- <dig> activation is an obligatory step in the signal transduction pathway of apoptosis induced by ischaemia/reoxygenation. however, necrosis was unaffected by caspase- <dig> inhibition, which agrees with results reported in adult rat ventricular myocytes  <cit> , although it has been observed that in cancer cells caspase inhibitors also retard necrosis in an in vitro model of chemical hypoxia  <cit> .

although these studies did not address the mechanism of caspase- <dig> activation, it has been previously shown that caspases can be activated by oxidative stress  <cit> , an important element of ischaemia/reoxygenation injury. furthermore, the apoptosis elicited by oxidative stress can be reduced by the opening of mitokatp channels  <cit>  and the apoptosis and caspase- <dig> activation induced by ischaemia/reoxygenation can be reduced by overexpression of the heat shock proteins hsp- <dig> and hsp- <dig>  <cit> . it is clear that more investigation is required to elucidate the signalling pathway leading to activation of caspase- <dig> during ischaemia/reoxygenation.

study limitations
in the present studies the human atrial tissue was used and therefore any extrapolation to the ventricular myocardium should be made with caution. thus, for example, katp channels that play a role in ischaemic injury exist in both atrium and ventricle  <cit> , although their distribution differs in the two cardiac chambers  <cit> . another potential limitation of these studies is that ischaemia and reperfusion were simulated by artificial means instead of using arterial occlusion and release, however, the avoidance of the confounding effects of collateral flow with our preparation could be advantageous. the model of simulated ischaemia and reoxygenation used in the present studies was characterised in our laboratory  <cit>  and subsequently has been used for the investigation of the mechanism of ischaemic and pharmacological preconditioning in man  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we have shown that cell death by apoptosis and necrosis in the human myocardium subjected to ischaemia and reoxygenation depends on the degree of the ischaemic insult and have a different time-course with apoptosis happening early during reoxygenation and necrosis becoming more important later. they also have shown that caspase- <dig> activation plays a critical role in apoptosis but that it does not affect necrosis.
