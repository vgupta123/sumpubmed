BACKGROUND
one in ten species on earth are flies . they are the most derived group within arthropods, and have experienced an explosive radiation in the last  <dig> million years  <cit> . over the past decade, dipteran draft genomes including the fruit fly , the house fly , and the malaria mosquito  have been published. within diptera, the family calliphoridae, commonly known as blow flies, comprises ~ <dig> species  <cit> , and contributes 8 % of species diversity in calyptrate flies  <cit> . calliphorids are ubiquitous, distributed world-wide, and are important in the medical , veterinary/agricultural  and forensic fields  <cit> . for example, blow flies are responsible for the transmission of human disease . mihalyi’s danger-index was calculated for seven blow fly species in south america, with consideration for the synanthropic index. six of the seven species posed a greater sanitary risk than the house fly  <cit> , a known disease vector  <cit> . interestingly, other closely related blow fly species have been shown to be medically advantageous as a means of wound debridement, otherwise known as maggot therapy  <cit> . in these cases, maggots physically debride the wound of decaying tissue while simultaneously excreting antimicrobial compounds  effective against antibiotic resistant bacteria such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus   <cit> .

recently, the first calliphorid genome, from the sheep blow fly , was released. the publication of the l. cuprina draft genome brings with it the potential for studying a group of flies that have evolved recently  <cit> , and have adopted many different life histories  <cit> . for example, the sheep blow fly specimen that was sequenced was from a location in which it is predominantly, if not exclusively, an obligate ectoparasite   <cit> , and has presumably adapted under selective pressures from subsisting on carrion to infesting live animals. calliphorid genomes will provide the necessary resources needed to understand the basic biological processes of lineage-specific traits in myiasis-causing flies.

the black blow fly, phormia regina , is a palearctic fly with records throughout north america and northern europe, and is the dominant carrion fly for most of canada and the united states  <cit> . we chose to examine the genome of this species because 1) it plays an important role in ecosystems via carrion decomposition and nutrient recycling  <cit> , 2) its’ abundance in north america, and 3) because it exhibits no specialized parasitic adaptations or unusual sex determination strategies , though the sex determination strategy for phormia regina is largely unknown. like other calliphorid flies, p. regina contains 2n =  <dig> chromosomes, including heteromorphic sex chromosomes  <cit> . these characteristics make it a good candidate for comparisons with species that have more specialized life histories. furthermore, providing an additional reference genome from calliphoridae will allow for a more complete understanding of the clade and adaptive processes that take place within it. we sequenced the male and female genomes , allowing us to characterize sex chromosomes and sex determining pathways, as well as evolutionary relationships of chemoreceptors, antimicrobial peptides, and insecticide resistance pathways in relation to other calliphorids and dipterans.

methods
genome sequencing – short reads
genomic dna was extracted from whole flies using the dneasy blood and tissue dna extraction kit  and pooled from five female and five male phormia regina flies housed in a laboratory colony . the founders originated from indianapolis, in  and were collected during the summer of  <dig>  the extracted dna from each individual was quantified using a qubit fluorometer  and mixed in equal proportions to yield the two pooled extracts, one for each sex. dna libraries were prepared using truseq dna sample preparation  and sequenced  using one half lane of an illumina hiseq <dig> platform at the purdue university genomics core facility . additional  <dig> reads were obtained as described in  <cit> .

genome sequencing – long reads
genomic dna was extracted from a whole single male p. regina specimen that had been in colony for > <dig> generations . dna library preparation and sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and reflects the p6-c <dig> sequencing enzyme and chemistry, respectively, at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai genomics core facility. 14 % of the input library eluted from the agarose cassette and was available for sequencing. for all cases, this yield was sufficient to proceed to primer annealing and dna sequencing on the pacbio rsii instrument . smrtcell libraries were placed onto the rsii machine at a sequencing concentration of  <dig> pm and configured for a 240-min continuous sequencing run. sequencing was conducted to achieve a 7401 bp subread n <dig> across a total of  <dig>  gb of data comprised of  <dig>  reads on  <dig> smrtcells.

due to the high error rate of reads generated from pacbio sequencing  <cit> , error correction was performed using the correct pacbio reads tool of clc’s genome finishing module plug-in v <dig> . <dig>  on a local workstation. additional error correction was also performed using the smrt analysis pacbiotoca correction module, with the assistance of the high quality illumina reads, using default settings.

genome processing and assembly
genome processing and assemblies were accomplished using clc genomics workbench v <dig> . <dig> . however, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the clc genome assembler, preliminary assemblies were generated using de novo genome assemblers: velvet  <cit>  and soapdenovo  <cit> . the clc assemblies were accomplished using a desktop computer with enhanced memory , whereas the velvet and soapdenovo assemblies were performed using a large memory supercomputing cluster . the male and female illumina short reads were initially assembled into two draft genomes with the three assemblers. each assembly was carried out using a range of kmer values until the ‘best’ assembly was captured as determined by contig number and contig n <dig> size . the clc-gwb de novo assembly using only illumina reads resulted in the smallest number of contigs and the longest n <dig> . with this data, we therefore decided to rely solely on clc-gwb for the remainder of our analyses and any additional assemblies produced using additional reads .table  <dig> comparative assembly statistics of preliminary assemblies generated using clc-gwb, velvet and soapdenovo

for each assembly pipeline, different kmers were used to generate the optimal assembly, and the main metric for determining quality of assembly was the combination of the number of contigs and the n50


a% reads = the number of reads that mapped to each assembled genome




the pipeline for assembly using the illumina and  <dig> reads on clc-gwb was as follows: low quality reads  and adaptor sequences were removed, duplicate reads were removed and overlapping pairs were merged . to remove extraneous or contaminating dna, we used a filtering pipeline that included the mapping and subsequent removal of the above processed reads to  <dig> phage  and  <dig> bacterial genomes . further filtering removed mitochondrial reads, which were assembled separately using methods described below. approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of reads were identified as bacteriophage and bacterial contaminants, respectively. following the removal of these contaminants, 5 % of overlapping paired reads were merged, 1 % of duplicates and low quality reads were removed, leaving a total of  <dig> , <dig> male and  <dig> , <dig> female reads for downstream analyses.

preliminary assembly iterations involved further optimization of kmer values  and bubble sizes . assemblies were evaluated based on total number of assembled contigs, estimated genome sizes, contig n <dig> values, and completeness as per cegma v <dig> . <dig> .

once optimal kmer sizes were determined , reads were mapped back to the assemblies using clc-gwb . pacbio  and  <dig> reads were combined with the illumina reads to create a hybrid de novo assembly by using them to scaffold the contigs using clc’s join contigs tool from the genome finishing module plug-in.

mitochondrial genome assembly
the mitochondrial genomes of seven calliphorid flies  were obtained from ncbi  and used as local reference genomes for the pooled male and female reads. reads that mapped to these reference genomes were then extracted and assembled using clc-gwb v <dig> . <dig> to generate a mitochondrial genome assembly. the mitochondrial genome sequence was 99 % similar to a previously published genome from p. regina , 93 % to protophormia terranovae , 92 % to chrysomya megacephala , 91 % to lucilia sericata , and 90 % to cochliomyia hominivorax , among others. for all calliphorid genomes, sequence similarity was 90 % or greater. all mitochondrial amino acid sequences were 100 % identical to other calliphorid mitochondrial protein sequences.

genome assembly assessment
assembly statistics were calculated using clc-gwb and the genome assessment tool quast v <dig>   <cit> . to evaluate the completeness of the genome assemblies, cegma v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to detect the number of complete and partial core eukaryotic genes present in the assembled genomes. this analysis was completed using genewise v <dig> . <dig>  ncbi-blast+ v <dig> . <dig> and geneid v <dig> . <dig> to return dna sequences of each prediction and their associated statistical reports.

gene prediction & gene ontology
augustus  <cit>  was used for ab initio prediction of gene sequences based on reference drosophila melanogaster sequences as it is an extensively studied and annotated genetic model organism. predicted protein sequences were annotated by blastp v <dig> .28+ using a non-redundant protein blast database and an e-value cutoff ≤ 1e- <dig>  comparative analysis of the male and female gene set was performed by using cd-hit-2d v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to compare the two protein datasets  of  <dig>  and length difference cutoff  of 90 %). the unique protein sequences for the male were blast searched  against the complete predicted amino acid sequences of the female to confirm their uniqueness. the same was done for the female protein set against the male protein set. proteins without hits were assumed to be unique to each sex.

functional characterization of the predicted gene sequences was performed using default settings in blast2go v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . gene ontology  terms were assigned to the annotated sequences. go slim functionality in blast2go was used to simplify the annotation into functional categories and the proteins were categorized at level  <dig> into the three main go classifications of biological process, cellular component and molecular function. interproscan  <cit>  statistics and kegg  <cit>  map pathways were also extracted from blast2go v <dig> . <dig> using default values. go terms from biological processes for each of the unique gene sets were summarized after the removal of redundant go terms by the web server revigo  to create a visual representative subset of the terms using a clustering algorithm that uses similarity measures  <cit> . the allowed similarity was set to  <dig>   and the database of go terms selected was from d. melanogaster.


sex chromosome identification
in order to characterize the sex chromosomes, we used the chromosome quotient   <cit>  approach which discovers sex chromosome sequences by using a stringent aligning criterion of the male and female reads onto each other’s genomes. the stringent alignment required a whole read to map onto the reference contigs with a zero mismatch in order to reduce the number of false positives  <cit> . the female to male ratio of the alignments was then used to distinguish contigs from the x or y chromosome. male contigs with a cq of less than the arbitrary  <dig>  were grouped as putative y chromosome contigs and female contigs with a cq ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were grouped as putative x chromosome contigs. the sex chromosome contigs were then blast searched against an arthropod database  to determine any homology with other insects in the database. the contigs were also compared against the well-characterized sex chromosomes of d. melanogaster .

putative gene approaches
all candidate genes were discovered using one or all of three approaches. first, genes of interest  were initially acquired from flybase  using queries for specific genes, or using genes associated with specific go terms. contigs with hits were identified via local blast  with an e-value cutoff of ≤ 1e- <dig>  gene sequences were individually annotated for gene structure using the web server version of the augustus prediction tool  <cit> , aligned using muscle  <cit>  and viewed with mview  <cit> . for comparison purposes with other calliphorid or dipteran species, if the gene sequences were available in genbank, they were acquired and included in our nucleotide  sequence alignments. if blastn approaches of drosophila sequences failed to produce hits, a second approach to discovering candidate genes was to use keyword searches in our annotated gene dataset. a third approach was to use tblastx and homologous sequences from other taxa  on the p. regina genomes.

sex-determining genes
putative sex determining genes were isolated and characterized by querying a set of known genes  – cg <dig>  transformer <dig>  – cg <dig>  sex lethal  – cg <dig>  doublesex  – cg <dig>  fruitless  – cg <dig>  daughterless  – cg <dig>  and maleless  – cg11680) from d. melanogaster against our male and female assemblies. tra and tra <dig> gene sequences did not result in contig hits using blastn, therefore we used the coding sequences from closely related blow fly species  as well as sequences from other calliphorid genomes  for which we have transcriptomic data using discontinuous megablast.

chemoreceptors

d. melanogaster gene sequences of odorant binding proteins , odorant receptors , gustatory receptors  and ionotropic receptors  were used as query sequences for local blast searches against the p. regina genome  using tblastx . protein sequences of the ionotrophic receptor ir25a were acquired from ncbi from the following species: lucilia cuprina-knc <dig>  calliphora stygia-aid <dig>  stomoxys calcitrans-xp <dig>  musca domestica-np <dig>  batrocera oleae-xp <dig>  ceratitis capitata-xp <dig>  and drosophila melanogaster-np <dig> 

antimicrobial peptides
a set of immune-related genes obtained from flybase.org was used to query the phormia regina genome for antimicrobial peptides . a second approach simply queried our blastp results  to identify putative immune-related genes that had homologs to other immune-related genes in insects.

insecticide resistance genes
genes associated with the metabolism of foreign material  are primarily cytochrome p450′s , glutathione s-transferases  and esterases/hydrolases . these genes were identified by manually searching the blastp results from the annotation step of the predicted genes; and kegg pathways for terms that included cytochrome p450s, gsts and esterases.

repetitive elements
repetitive elements in the male and female phormia regina genomes as well as the putatively identified x and y chromosomes were identified using repeatmasker  <cit>  and a library of all known dipteran transposable elements . in addition to known transposable elements, repeatmasker searches were used to identify low-complexity regions including mini and microsatellite sequences. output from repeatmasker was used to quantify overall repeat content and an accumulation profile. for the accumulation profile, which reflects relative rates and periods of tes in a genome, the kimura 2-parameter  <cit>  distance between a transposable element insertion and the assumed ancestral sequence were calculated using the calcdivergencefromalign.pl script packaged with repeatmasker.

RESULTS
genome assembly
raw reads and genome assemblies have been submitted to genbank . mitochondrial reads  were removed from the main genomic dataset and assembled into a mtdna genome .

in order to refine and scaffold our assemblies, we added longer  <dig>  and error-corrected pacbio reads . we repeated the de novo assembly process in clc-gwb using a range of kmer values. our ‘best’ hybrid assembled genomes contained a combination of smaller numbers of contigs and longer n50s . the male  and female  genomes had average coverages of 44x with >97 % of the reads mapping back to the genomes.table  <dig> final draft genome assembly statistics of the male and female genomes following the addition of  <dig> and pacbio reads, including a measure of the robustness of the assembly in the number of core eukaryotic genes assembled 




these values are larger than the experimentally estimated sizes of  <dig> mbp and  <dig> mbp for the female and male p. regina, respectively  <cit> . this is likely due to the presence of repetitive sequences that do not assemble well  <cit> , as well as the presence of allelic variation due to pooled sequencing of five male and five female individuals  <cit> . the robustness of the protein coding portion of the assembly was assessed using cegma  <cit> , where  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of complete core eukaryotic genes were identified in the female and male genomes .

gene prediction and ontology
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> full length genes were predicted by augustus  <cit>   in the male and female genomes, respectively. the genic characteristics of the exonic regions and intronic regions of the predicted genes in both sexes show a total of ~ <dig>  exons and  <dig>  introns . the total number of predicted protein-encoding genes in our assembled genomes was small compared to other recently sequenced dipterans such as lucilia cuprina   <cit>  and musca domestica   <cit> . this may be due to the high stringency we used for gene prediction where only complete genes  were allowed. with a more contiguous version of the genome, and inclusion of transcriptome data in the prediction process, the predicted gene count will probably increase. for comparison, we predicted complete genes in the scaffolded version of the l. cuprina genome  and found  <dig>  genes , these results demonstrate that our pipeline for predicting genes is more conservative.table  <dig> male and female p. regina gene predictions including the total number of complete genes, the genic structure characteristics , the proportion genes that produced an ncbi result, and the proportion with characterized identifiable protein domains 




in order to compare the genic structures of the predicted genes with other flies, the total counts and average lengths of the exons and introns were compared to recently published genomes of the common housefly m. domestica  <cit> , the blow fly l. cuprina  <cit>  and the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster . the average lengths of gene and intron sequences of l. cuprina and m. domestica are approximately double the size of p. regina’s. however, the average lengths of the exons are similar in size among the three species. the cause in the length disparity is likely due to the scaffolded nature of the musca and lucilia genomes, which contain a large number of n’s as placeholders – thus giving rise to seemingly larger introns.table  <dig> an overview comparing the genic structure and statistics in p. regina , l. cuprina  and m. domestica  genome assemblies


astatistics of the genic structure for l. cuprina were obtained from anstead et al in  <cit> , and for m. domestica from scott et al. in




a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the predicted genes in the female and male, respectively, had homology to sequences in genbank with e-values less than 1e- <dig>  therefore, approximately 6 % of the predicted genes  have no apparent homologs in the arthropod database and could be unique to p. regina. additionally, annotation by interproscan classified  <dig>  and  <dig>  % protein domains in the female and male predicted genes, respectively.

the species that were most represented in the blastp results for both sexes came from calyptrate flies, specifically the sheep blow fly , followed distantly by the stable fly  and the common house fly  reflecting the phylogenetic relatedness among these species  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  gene sequences from the female and  <dig>  gene sequences from the male had hits to l. cuprina gene sequences while ~7 % of gene sequences from both sexes had top hits from the stable fly and m. domestica .

the two most abundant biological process go categories for both sexes were cellular processes  and metabolic processes  . the go terms that were associated with molecular function were mainly assigned to binding  and catalytic activity . while the top go terms associated with cellular component were assigned to cell  and organelle  . the overall distribution of genes within go classifications in p. regina was very similar to m. domestica and d. melanogaster  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> go term classification of the  <dig> functional categories  of the predicted genes in the male and female genome assemblies




categorization of information from molecular-level interactions extracted from the annotated go terms was performed by the kegg component in blast2go. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> kegg pathways from the go-slim blast2go analysis were identified for the male and female gene sets, respectively. a visual representation of the pathways with greater than  <dig> sequences is shown in fig.  <dig>  the top pathways for both sexes were purine metabolism, thiamine metabolism and biosynthesis of antibiotics. a full list of the kegg pathways can be found in additional file 11: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> the top  <dig> kegg biological pathways of the male and female gene sets extracted from the blast2go analysis




sex chromosomes
typically, sex determination is carried out through the heteromorphic xx/xy system where y-linked male determining genes or the presences of a y-linked male determining factor are proposed to repress female development causing male sexual differentiation thus promoting the male phenotype  <cit> . this has been observed in the mediterranean fruit fly , the olive fruit fly  and the common house fly   <cit> .

putative sex chromosomes for both the male and female genomes were isolated using the chromosome quotient  approach  <cit>  and  <dig> and  <dig>  contigs were identified to putatively belong to the x and y chromosome, respectively. adding the sizes of each contig, these result in a putative x chromosome size of ~ <dig>  mbp and ~ <dig>  mbp for the putative y chromosome, which approximates measured differences between the male and female flies of ~ <dig> mbp  <cit> . a direct comparison with the drosophila x and y chromosomes yielded  <dig>  female contigs with homology to the x chromosome, and  <dig> male contigs  with homology to the y chromosome. blastn results against the arthropod database  resulted in 47 %  of the x chromosome contigs and 26 %  of the y chromosome contigs identified as having homologous sequences in the database. most putative y chromosome contigs did not yield blast hits. a reasonable explanation for the limited number of blast hits may be the fact that very few model species have characterized and annotated y chromosomes in the database due to repeat-rich heterochromatic sequences  <cit> .

the majority of the hits from the blastn results of the x and y chromosomes corresponded to repetitive sequences. for example, in the blast results from the x chromosome, of the contigs that produced hits, 58 % hit to multiple bac sequences in calliphora vicina achaete-scute complex, as-c . even though these sequences contain the as-c complex genes, these blast hits are likely hitting to the repetitive regions present in 20–25 % of these bacs  <cit> . furthermore, in drosophilidae, the as-c complex is found in the x chromosome, where scute plays an additional role in sex determination acting as an x chromosome signal element  <cit> . the presence of homologous sequences to the as-c complex in both the male and female putative sex contigs is an indicator that this complex may also be involved in sex determination pathway in p. regina.


unique sex genes
a comparative analysis between the male and female predicted genes showed that  <dig> genes were unique to the male and  <dig> predicted genes were unique to the female. these unique sets of genes are a likely combination of sex-biased genes that drive phenotypic differences leading to sex-specific developmental trajectories  <cit> , and/or be present in either male or female assembly because a complete gene was predicted in one sex and not the other. approximately 73 % of the male and female unique genes had homology to sequences in ncbi’s arthropoda nr database. gene ontology analysis of the unique set of genes for each sex in the biological processes category produced a total of  <dig> and  <dig> go terms for the male and female, respectively. comparing the two sets of go terms indicated that  <dig> of the go terms were unique to the male while  <dig> were unique to the female. the long lists of the unique go terms for each sex was summarized by clustering go terms that belong to the same family and removing redundant terms using the web server revigo  <cit> .

an example of a clustered category in the male is the category flocculation  which include the go terms sperm motility, energy taxis and positive chemotaxis. the genes functionalized with these go terms may be specific to the males and involved in sperm chemotaxis where sperm from the male fly is guided by a chemoattractant excreted by the female to fertilize an oocyte  <cit> . one of the categories clustered in the female  is response to xenobiotic stimulus. these are genes expressed during an immune response or during exposure to toxic foreign material  producing enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> and acetyl-coa synthetases. these female specific genes may be involved in the protection of female flies against the diverse array of pathogens it comes across while laying eggs, or from components of male ejaculates after mating  <cit> . similar go categories connected to immune response were detected to be enriched in female d. melanogaster flies as compared to males  <cit> .

sex determining genes
in most dipterans investigated thus far, sex determination is regulated by a cascade of genes which exhibit a hierarchical interaction during development where a product of one gene controls the sex-specific splicing of the gene immediately downstream  <cit> . some of the key players involved in dipteran sex determination pathway include the genes sex lethal , doublesex , transformer , transformer  <dig> , fruitless , daughterless  and maleless  .

the gene tra is one of the main sex determining genes in various insects whose ancestral function is to introduce variation in sex determining mechanisms  <cit> . we queried both the male and female p. regina genomes for homologs using d. melanogaster sex determining genes but found none. we then searched for p. regina tra and tra <dig> using homologs from closely related species - l. cuprina, cochliomyia hominivorax, c. macellaria and l. sericata. this search also failed to produce any homologs to tra or tra <dig> – rather producing homologs to hypothetical l. cuprina proteins . the only homology shared between our putative hits and those in the reference databases are due to the presence of zinc finger domains. for tra – cochliomyia macellaria and c. hominivorax only share  <dig>  % sequence identity. our putative tra gene in phormia regina shares  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % sequence identity with cochliomyia and chrysomya rufifacies, respectively . for tra <dig> – a query of our genomes yielded hundreds of hits with e-values less than 1e- <dig> – suggesting not an assembly error, but rather a common domain is detected. additional approaches are necessary to more fully annotate these genes in p. regina.

the gene doublesex  is another transcription factor that controls the activity of genes involved in sexual differentiation  <cit> . doublesex is differentially spliced, encoding male and female sex specific dsx proteins  <cit> . homologous sequences of dsx were detected in both sexes with an e-value less than 1e- <dig>  the sex determining gene daughterless is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix  family of dna binding domains and is a transcription factor  <cit> . da is essential for neurogenesis, oogenesis and sex determination  <cit> . we annotated da in p. regina for both sexes. the length of the predicted da gene was determined to be 4494 bp and 8479 bp long in the male and female, respectively, in comparison to the d. melanogaster  da gene  . the difference between the two appears to be in the 5’ utr region in which some noncoding gene sequences are predicted in the female, but the male’s 5′ utr was not completely assembled .fig.  <dig> predicted gene structure of the sex determining gene daughterless for the female  and male  p. regina. the red boxes represent the exon, the grey boxes inclusive of the red represent the mrna, and the black line represent the intron. image is not drawn to scale




the coding sequences of da for both sexes were nearly identical  and predicted to be 2112 bp long, which is comparable to that of d. melanogaster of 2133 bp  and l. cuprina 2278 bp . a multiple sequence alignment of the coding sequences demonstrates the high degree of variation with only  <dig>  % similarity to l. cuprina, and  <dig>  % to d. melanogaster . protein sequences of da were also compared between the three species. the length of da was  <dig> amino acid sequences for both sexes in p. regina compared to  <dig> amino acid sequences in l. cuprina  and  <dig> amino acid sequences in d. melanogaster . amino acid sequence alignment shows l. cuprina to be 95 % identical to p. regina, while d. melanogaster is 59 % identical . a conserved region shared among the three species is the helix-loop-helix domain .

the maleless  gene is one of the regulatory genes required for dosage compensation of x-linked genes in the x chromosome of male flies  <cit> . annotation of the gene maleless  resulted in gene sequences of total length 6375 bp and 6374 bp predicted for the male and female sexes, respectively, approximating the size of mle in d. melanogaster . the length of the protein sequence of mle in p. regina for both sexes was  <dig> amino acids, comparable to d. melanogaster  with  <dig>  % similarity to p. regina .


chemoreceptor genes
a fly’s ability to detect and respond to a chemical signal is integral to its survival. in particular, for blow flies, the adults must be able to detect odors associated with decay immediately following death in order to be among the first insects to show up and lay eggs. following detection of carrion, an insect must be able to determine the quality of the resource and decide if it is suitable by using a variety of gustatory receptors , ionotropic receptors , odorant receptors , and odorant binding proteins . these four gene families are the main chemoreceptors that function in the olfactory and gustatory system of insects  <cit> . to determine the presence of chemoreceptors in the p. regina genomes, we queried d. melanogaster’s chemoreceptor genes using tblastx. d. melanogaster has a predicted total of  <dig> grs through alternative splicing,  <dig> ors  <cit> ,  <dig> genes encoding irs  <cit>  and  <dig> genes encoding obps  <cit> . the tblastx results of the predicted chemoreceptors  in d. melanogaster resulted in a total of  <dig> grs,  <dig> obps,  <dig> ors and  <dig> ir’s with homologous sequences in the female assembled genome. these homologous sequences were detected in  <dig> contigs ,  <dig> contigs ,  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> contigs  .

in addition to the reception of chemical stimulus in olfaction, ir’s have recently been found to be involved in thermosensation, and the circadian cycle  <cit> . in comparison to ors, the ir family in insects is relatively conserved suggesting that it is an ancient chemosensory receptor family  <cit> . ir25a is one of the most highly conserved irs in many species  <cit> . it acts as a co-receptor with other different odor-sensing irs. in d. melanogaster, it is expressed in sensory neurons in the antennae and also in the proboscis  <cit> . we compared ir25a protein sequences from the female p. regina to l. cuprina, m. domestica, calliphora stygia, stomoxys calcitrans, d. melanogaster, c. capitata and b. oleae via multiple sequence alignment, and subsequent phyml for tree building, and treedyn for tree drawing . overall there was high similarity, with sequence identity ranging from  <dig> to 97 %. the predicted p. regina ir25a sequence was most similar to l. cuprina with  <dig>  %. the amino acid sequences in regions annotated as putative peptide binding sites were mostly conserved . the remarkable sequence conservation of ir25a implies the presence of a unique and essential evolutionary conserved role of the ir25a receptors in various insect species .

antimicrobial genes
blow flies develop in an environment of decomposing vertebrate tissue that is overrun with bacteria and as such, they not only compete with bacteria for resources but also need protection from infection. insects in general have a diverse innate immunity pathway that provides protection from various microbes that can inhibit their survival  <cit> . as a result, they possess different mechanisms that signal the expression of genes activating an antimicrobial defense system to fight bacterial and fungal infections  <cit> . some blow fly species have proven useful in wound debridement therapy as they also excrete many potent antimicrobial compounds  <cit> .

two approaches were used to discover antimicrobial peptide genes: blastn using known d. melanogaster genes and keyword searching for known antimicrobial peptide sequences against annotation information assigned to the predicted protein sequences . thirty-six drosophila genes were queried and hits were identified for  <dig> using blastn. using the blastp approach,  <dig> predicted protein sequences produced blastp hits with homology to genes present in four major signaling pathways in insects that are involved with protection from bacterial and fungal infections. these include the toll, immune deficiency , janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription , and jnk pathways  <cit> . these pathways recognize different types of microbes and induce the transcription of immune-related genes which degrade pathogens or act as signaling molecules  <cit> . both male and female had near identical blastp results. we therefore selected the female genome for the annotation of the contigs and genes of interest.

the toll signaling pathway is activated by the presence of gram-positive bacteria or fungi while the imd pathway is mainly activated by gram-negative bacteria. both pathways lead to the production of antimicrobial peptides to fight pathogens that cause infection  <cit> . a number of genes involved in the toll signaling pathway were predicted in the p. regina female genome, including spaetzle, tube, toll, cactus, g protein-coupled receptor kinase  <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with the suggestions that the toll signaling pathway may be involved in the antimicrobial defense system in blow flies as it is in other insects  <cit> . furthermore, protein recognition receptors involved in pathogen recognition were identified in p. regina. these include peptidoglycan-recognition proteins – pgrp-le, pgrp-lc, pgrp-sc <dig> and gram negative binding proteins – gnbp <dig> and gnbp <dig>  the nf-kappa β-like gene, relish, which is involved in inducing the humoral immune response in drosophila as well as antibacterial and antifungal factors  <cit>  was also identified. both relish and pgrp-lc are involved in the imd pathway.

similar to m. domestica and d. melanogaster, p. regina harbors the four antimicrobial families, attacins, diptericins, cecropins and defensins. we found homology to genes related to antimicrobial humoral responses , as well as genes responsible for responses to bacteria , all possessing kinase or peptidase activity capable of breaking down bacteria cell walls . these are likely produced and excreted in the salivary glands of the developing larvae as they feed on the decaying tissue. a summary of the top hits from blastn results after querying our female genome for the homologous sequences from d.melanogaster are listed in additional file 21: table s <dig>  the four antimicrobial families were represented by cecropin a <dig> , iconoclast , hephaestus  and relish . these results based on homology to immune-related proteins in other insects, imply that the immune signaling pathway in p. regina is similar to other model insects, and may have evolved to work within the harsh sanitary conditions to which p. regina is normally exposed.

xenobiotic resistance
the enhancement of xenobiotic  metabolism in insects due to the extensive use of insecticides, has led to the evolution of xenobiotic resistance and tolerance in insects creating a challenge in pest management  <cit> . the three major groups of genes involved in producing metabolic enzymes to protect insects against plant defense systems  and insecticides are cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, esterases/hydrolases, and glutathione-s-transferases  <cit> . the presence of these detoxifying enzymes likely helps p. regina to withstand high pathogen loads from decaying carrion. cytochrome p <dig> genes are the family of enzymes primarily associated with metabolism of xenobiotics and resistance to most insecticides  <cit> . they are also involved in the catalysis of a range of chemical reactions important for developmental processes.

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> predicted genes  were annotated via the d. melanogaster database as cytochrome p <dig> genes from the female and male p. regina genes, respectively. this is fewer than in any of the three species we compared; m. domestica has  <dig> p <dig> genes,  <dig> in d. melanogaster, and  <dig> in glossina morsitans  <cit> . however, when we applied our methods to the lucilia cuprina published predicted gene set, we recovered  <dig> p <dig> genes . cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> were the predominant p <dig> families in both male and female draft genomes  where they occupied approximately  <dig> and 30 % of the total p <dig> genes respectively . the predominance of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> p <dig> genes was also observed in the genomes of d. melanogaster  <cit>  and m. domestica where they occupy  <dig> and >60 % of the total cytochrome p <dig> genes in their genomes, respectively. the reduction in the number of p <dig> genes  is likely due to the stringent gene prediction criteria used in our fragmented genomes .

an increase in the expression or activity of the metabolic enzymes that belong to the esterases and hydrolases family has also been linked to insecticide resistance  <cit>  and correlated with resistance to two major insecticide classes: pyrethroids and organophosphates  <cit> . this is mainly due to the presence of ester bonds in most insecticides which are hydrolyzed by the esterase  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes with hydrolase/esterase activities were predicted in the female and male draft genomes, respectively. the common ones in both sexes included phosphodiesterase, thioesterase, carboxylesterase and phosphatase .

glutathione s-transferases  are multifunctional enzymes that are not only involved in detoxification of xenobiotic compounds, but also in other physiological processes in insects including intracellular transport and hormone biosynthesis  <cit> . in the detoxification process, they function by metabolizing insecticides producing water-soluble metabolites that are easily excreted  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> gst genes were predicted in the female and male p. regina genomes, respectively . unfortunately, insecticide resistance is a growing problem  <cit>  in many insects, including mosquitos  and blow flies  has in some cases been attributed to glutathione s-transferase activity .

repetitive elements
repeat identification in the male and female genomes via homology-based searches identified close to  <dig> and  <dig> mbp of repetitive dna accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the male and female assemblies . approximately  <dig>   and  <dig> mbp  of repetitive sequences were transposable elements, and the remaining were low complexity sequences including mini- and microsatellites. several major transposable elements super-families were identified in the p. regina genome, but the vast majority  of elements belonged to  <dig> families or super families: jockeys, loas, gypsys, tc-mariners, and helitrons. dna transposons and retrotransposons were present in roughly equal proportions. low complexity sequences were the dominant type of repetitive sequence making up ~66 % of the male and female genome assemblies.

dipteran species show significant variability in sine content but sine elements appear to be missing from the p. regina genome entirely. for example, sines are absent in drosophila  <cit>  but present in high copy numbers in other dipterans  <cit> . only  <dig> sine insertions were identified in p. regina, most of which are distantly related, or highly mutated version of sine-3_qc and sine-4_qc from culex quinquefasciatus, the southern house mosquito. in c. quinquefasciatus, sine-3_qc and sine-4_qc are present more than ten thousand times  <cit> .

based on the female  and male  accumulation profiles, it appears that transposable elements in p. regina tend to be old, with little accumulation in the recent past. in general, transposable element insertions for each family tend to be more numerous in the female genome assembly. transposable elements present in the female assembly, but absent in the male assembly follow a similar accumulation profile to the genomes as a whole  ruling out temporally biased accumulation in either sex. class ii transposons, lines, and ltrs accumulated at similar times given that the majority of elements in each group are between  <dig> and 45 % diverged from their putative ancestral partner. dna transposons have been accumulating for a slightly longer period than lines and ltrs with most element divergences ranging from  <dig> to 41 %. in all, >97 % of all elements are >10 % divergent from their respective consensus elements. this implies that the minimal transposable elements accumulation has occurred in the recent past, or that newly inserted transposable elements are being actively removed from the genome  <cit> . however, with high divergences between potentially novel transposable elements in p. regina and transposable elements in repbase is possible that lineage-specific sines are present but unidentifiable using homology based searches  <cit>  and a full te curation of the genome is necessary.fig.  <dig> transposable element accumulation in the female  and male  phormia regina genome assemblies. kimura 2-parameter distances were calculated between transposable element insertions in the genome and the homologous element in the dipteran repbase library. larger divergences indicate elements with larger mutation loads, and by extension, were deposited in the genome in the more distant past. less than  <dig> sine elements are present in either the female or male assemblies and are not shown here. transposable elements are slightly more abundant in the female genome assembly. the accumulation of female specific repeats  follows that of the whole genome in general




close to  <dig>  mb of the x chromosome  was derived from repeats, compared to ~ <dig> kb of the y chromosome . for both chromosomes, more than half the repetitive sequences are in the form of simple repeats . the increased amount of repeats on the x chromosome is likely due to its larger size, however, even though the x chromosome is proportionally more repetitive than the y, it is not large enough to be significant.

CONCLUSIONS
although all impacts are impossible to foresee, we anticipate four important fields will benefit from this data:  insecticide resistance and/or sensitivity;  adaptive evolution in a rapidly evolving clade ;  sex chromosome evolution; and  genotype-phenotype correlations of development rate variation.

insecticide resistance
there are four main calliphorids that are serious agricultural pests causing myiasis : chrysomya bezziana , cochliomyia hominivorax , lucilia sericata  and l. cuprina   <cit> , although other species have been implicated in secondary myiasis, including p. regina  was recently sequenced in an effort to determine how insecticide resistance has persisted and to develop novel pest management targets that would not harm beneficial insects. in order to better understand these processes and assess target efficacy, it is important to understand how these genes are structured in other closely related flies. the p. regina reference genome presented here will provide the opportunity to extract candidate genes, determine the structure-function relationship, and produce new ligands with the potential to slow or eradicate these pest species.

adaptive evolution
calliphoridae includes approximately  <dig> different species and accounts for ~8 % of calyptrate species diversity  <cit> . many lineages within calliphoridae have evolved specialized adaptations. as the above example demonstrates, ectoparasitism has evolved at least twice within calliphoridae, perhaps in response to selective pressures of the usually ephemeral carrion resource – if the insect can arrive at a resource before it becomes available to all its competitors, its genes have a greater probability of being maintained. p. regina does not have these features or life-strategies, suggesting the retention of the ancestral life history, and can thus serve as a robust reference genome from which more derived features can be understood.

sex chromosome evolution
many calyptrate flies utilize xy sex determination. in many other species sharing this system, the x chromosome is relatively stable, and the y chromosome has experienced loss of function due to the absence of recombination over time and the presence of repetitive dna. therefore, the structure of the y chromosome represents its approximate evolutionary age. with individual sex genomes, and putative chromosomes sequenced and assembled herein, we can compare sex chromosome structure within the calliphoridae, where some species have vastly different sex chromosome sizes , or within the monogenic fly chrysomya rufifacies with no difference in genome sizes of the male and female flies  <cit> . additionally, this reference genome will be useful in studying sex determining pathways in calliphoridae, which could be useful as a mechanism to target for pest control  <cit> .

development rate variation
as many of these flies are primary colonizers of vertebrate carrion  <cit> , they have forensic uses in cases of decomposition when the time of death cannot be determined using traditional physiological approaches. the collected larvae serve as a clock to the minimum time since the individual died, as they will only colonize a body following death . then, the age of the larvae is estimated for a minimum postmortem interval  <cit> . the age, however, is estimated from a reference data set in which laboratory conditions permit multiple temperatures and conditions . these models of development assume little to no population-level variation even though variation has been clearly demonstrated . thus, it is important to understand the fundamental developmental processes in blow flies if they are to be used for postmortem interval estimates, and to be capable to predicting the possible variation based on genotypes of the individual larvae collected. once again, the availability of a reference genome, differentiating male and female genomes  <cit> , will be invaluable to understanding the molecular basis of development, and its associated variation.

this first draft of the p. regina genome represents a critical step in calliphorid genomics. the accessibility of the p. regina genome will quicken the pace of the exploration and comparisons in the evolutionary relationships and developmental analysis among blow fly species and also with other dipteran species. in time, these findings could have significant agricultural, medical and forensics fields.
