BACKGROUND
cancer is a major and growing clinical problem in modern societies. although usually referred to as a single disease, cancer represents more than  <dig> different pathologies, which are characterized by an uncontrolled cell growth that may derive in the invasion of surrounding tissues and the subsequent generation of metastasis in distant organs of the body  <cit> . tumor development is a complex process in which genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are implicated  <cit> . the importance of genetic factors in cancer is now well established, as mutations in specific genes have been associated with the neoplastic transformation and development of specific cancer types  <cit> . this fact is further supported by the existence of hereditary cancer syndromes, caused by germ-line mutations in specific genes and responsible for about 5% of all diagnosed malignancies  <cit> . over the last two decades, a number of studies have focused on the identification of the different genes that can contribute to cancer. these studies have led to the conclusion that alterations in three types of genes – oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and stability genes – are mainly associated with the genesis of cancer  <cit> . these studies have alsocontributed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which these genes act during tumor development and progression  <cit> . finally, in some cases this knowledge has resulted in the introduction of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment  <cit> .

chimpanzees  represent our most closely related organism. they have a more similar physiology to human than any other model organism, and the study of several human diseases in chimpanzee has led to a better understanding of pathologies such as hepatitis or aids  <cit> . interestingly, a number of works have reported that cancer incidence in non-human primates is very low. this fact is especially evident for epithelial neoplasms such as breast, prostate or lung carcinomas, which are responsible for more than 20% of human deaths but whose incidence in great apes is less than 2%  <cit> . the difference in cancer incidence between human and chimpanzees can mainly derive from three facts: i) exposure to different environmental factors, including diet and habits, ii) differences in life expectancy and iii) genetic differences that might result in humans being more susceptible to cancer development.

the completion of the first draft of the chimpanzee genome sequence has opened the possibility to study whether genetic differences between human and chimpanzee could contribute to the observed differences in cancer susceptibility between both species  <cit> . to address this question, we have used the chimpanzee genome sequence to identify and compare the orthologous genes of a set of  <dig> human genes that have been previously implicated in cancer development  <cit> . this analysis has revealed that all analyzed human cancer genes are present in the chimpanzee and exhibit a high degree of conservation between both species.

however, further detailed analysis of a series of genes of special interest in human cancer such as p <dig> and brca <dig>  has revealed some differences with the corresponding chimpanzee counterparts. in this work, we present the results of this comparative genomic analysis and discuss the putative relevance of the observed genetic changes for explaining some aspects of the differential cancer susceptibility between human and chimpanzee.

RESULTS
analysis of cancer genes in the chimpanzee genome
as an initial attempt to study cancer-associated genes in the chimpanzee, we have compared  <dig> human cancer genes to the chimpanzee genome and identified and analyzed the orthologous genes . the set of human cancer genes was selected from the literature based on mutational analysis and/or roles in processes such as chromosomal stability, promoter methylation or control of mitotic checkpoints  <cit> . as can be seen in figure  <dig>  more than 50% of the genes belong to three main functional categories: transcription factors, phosphorylation , and dna repair. other functional groups include structural proteins, gtpases and gtpase regulators or proteins involved in ubiquitylation. finally, other minor groups include tumor suppressors, the protein and rna components of the telomerase, or proteins implicated in apoptosis among others.

to perform this study, the cdna sequence from all human cancer genes was first compared with the chimpanzee genome in order to determine the presence or absence of the corresponding orthologs, and then to predict their complete cdna sequences. this analysis revealed that all analyzed human cancer genes are present in the chimpanzee genome. the high sequence coverage of this set of cancer genes , has allowed us to perform a detailed comparison – at the nucleotide and amino acid level – of cancer genes between both species .

direct comparison of human and chimpanzee cancer genes indicates that they are highly conserved, showing  <dig> % identities at the protein level, and  <dig> % at the nucleotide level, what is similar to the average amino acid identities between both organisms   <cit> . interestingly, we have identified  <dig> cancer genes  encoding proteins which are 100% identical to their human counterparts . the conservation of cancer genes between human and chimpanzee suggests that they perform essential cellular functions and are in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . this proposal is consistent with the fact that most analyzed cancer genes encode intracellular proteins highly conserved from yeast to human, and implicated in fundamental processes such as cell signalling, cell cycle control and maintenance of genomic stability  <cit> .

analysis of insertions and deletions in protein coding regions from thechimpanzee genome
despite the high conservation between human and chimpanzee cancer genes described above, in the course of the present study we identified  <dig> chimpanzee genes  that encode proteins containing or lacking specific residues due to the insertion or deletion of codons in the corresponding open reading frames . the analysis of these genes can be important in order to identify human-specific changes in protein coding genes. a total of  <dig> chimpanzee genes encode proteins containing extra amino acids in their sequence,  <dig> of them located within trinucleotide repeats resulting in longer expansions in chimpanzee, with up to  <dig> extra glutamine residues in the case of mn <dig>  on the other hand,  <dig> chimpanzee genes encode proteins with less amino acids than their human counterparts. similarly to the expanded proteins in chimpanzee,  <dig> of the  <dig> expansions in human proteins were located in trinucleotide repeats. the higher proportion of longer alleles in humans than in chimpanzee is consistent with known results  <cit> . interestingly, analysis of these expanded regions using information retrieved from est databases, resulted in the finding that six human genes, aspscr <dig>  dek, fancc, mllt <dig>  myst <dig> and znf <dig>  are polymorphic for these loci. as functional trinucleotide tandem repeats that vary in humans have been shown to be also variable in chimpanzee  <cit> , it is likely that all these genes present variability in both species. these results suggest that these regions might be prone to genetic instability, and open the possibility to investigate if all these genes showing human-chimpanzee variability in trinucleotide repeats are polymorphic in humans and influence the risk of tumor development.

during the course of this analysis, we also observed that  <dig> genes  contained putative frameshifts and/or premature stop codons in the coding sequences . this high number of conflictive regions is not likely to reflect bona fide differences between these species, but the result of sequencing problems or artefacts derived from the assembly process. to evaluate these possibilities, we took advantage of the availability of two independent assemblies for the chimpanzee genome, called arachne and pcap  <cit> . the arachne assembly, containing more coverage and fewer order conflicts, is used by most public genome browsers and was employed in the initial steps of this study. the pcap assembly is a de novo assembly that is non-redundant with arachne and provides an additional resource for this kind of sequencing conflicts. to distinguish artefacts of the assembly process from real differences or sequencing errors, we compared the conflictive regions identified in cancer genes to the pcap assembly. this strategy resulted in the resolution of 83% of the conflicts, as they were correct in the pcap assembly, thereby suggesting that they represented errors generated during the assembly process. nevertheless,  <dig> cancer genes  still contained the same frameshift in both assemblies. because these genes might represent real differences between human and chimpanzee cancer genes, we pcr-amplified all these conflictive regions, and the resulting dna fragments were subjected to direct sequencing. this strategy allowed us to confirm that these genes do not contain frameshifts or premature stop codons, and encode functional proteins in all cases. these findings call the attention to the degree of accuracy of the chimpanzee genome despite the existence of two assemblies. ongoing efforts to increase the shotgun coverage from ~ <dig> fold to ~ <dig> fold redundancy will produce a higher quality sequence necessary for a reliable ascertainment of specific interesting discrepancies.

analysis of missense mutations in cancer genes in the chimpanzee genome
mutations in human cancer genes can be originated by different causes, including chromosomal translocations resulting in fusion proteins, disruption of the coding sequence by frameshifts or premature stop codons, and point mutations that modify the structure and function of the corresponding protein. as mentioned above, we did not find evidence in the chimpanzee genome of gene fusions, frameshifts or premature stop codons in the set of analyzed cancer genes. however, it is interesting to study the status in the chimpanzee genome of residues that are variable in human genes and are associated with cancer. for this purpose, we extracted the information of variant alleles in human genes from the human gene mutation database  and the online mendelian inheritance in man  databases  <cit> , and determined the corresponding residue in the chimpanzee protein. we found two genes associated with breast cancer, brca <dig> and erbb <dig>  in which the chimpanzee sequence differed from the human in residues that have been reported to be polymorphic in humans. both alleles, brca <dig>  and erbb <dig> , have been associated with different risk of developing breast cancer  <cit> . interestingly, in both cases the chimpanzee sequence  corresponds to the allele that has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer, and both are being found at high frequencies in humans, around  <dig>  for n <dig>  <cit>  and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for i <dig> 

we also identified at least two cases in genes associated with colon carcinomas, mlh <dig>  and msh <dig> , and one with prostate carcinomas, pon <dig> , in which the susceptibility allele in human appears to be the wild-type allele in chimpanzee. however, due to the limited clinical and functional data on these variants, the biological significance of these findings is still unknown, and further studies will be required to determine the pathogenic activity of these alleles.

analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p <dig> in the chimpanzee genome
a detailed analysis of the gene encoding the tumor suppressor p <dig>  which is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer  <cit> , showed a single amino acid difference between human  and chimpanzee . interestingly, this p <dig> codon is polymorphic in human and the allele encoding pro <dig> is frequent in some populations  <cit> . analysis of chimpanzee dna from four different geographic regions revealed a pro/pro genotype in all cases, what confirmed our findings using the chimpanzee genomic sequence. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that this codon might be polymorphic in chimpanzee and that the arg <dig> allele could be present in some individuals, what would require the analysis of a greater number of samples. in this sense, sequencing of  <dig> chimpanzee samples revealed a pro/pro genotype, suggesting that this allele would be the most common one in chimpanzee, with a poisson distribution maximum estimate of allele frequency of  <dig>  at a 95% confidence interval.

additionally, we have sequenced the same p <dig> region in different primates, including gorilla, orangutan or mandrill, and determined that codon  <dig> codes for pro in all species . the fact that apes and some old world monkeys contain pro at this position, suggests that it is the ancestral allele and the arg <dig> allele is unique to the human lineage. nevertheless, the ancestral pro/pro genotype is still present in humans, representing about  <dig> % of the central-european population and 45% of the african yoruba population   <cit> . this finding raises interesting questions about the different susceptibility to cancer of both organisms, as several studies have shown that both isoforms are functionally different in their ability to induce apoptosis or interact with p <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the brca <dig> locus in the chimpanzee genome
the tumor suppressor brca <dig> has an unusual evolutionary history, in that ratios of replacement to silent nucleotide substitutions  are greater than one when comparing human and chimpanzee lineages, but not in lineages of other primates or other mammals  <cit> . this observation is consistent with positive selection pressure on brca <dig> during recent hominoid evolution. we evaluated the complete human and chimpanzee genomic sequences of brca <dig> in light of this observation. in human and chimpanzee, the brca <dig> locus spans ~ <dig> kb, including the brca <dig> gene itself and a partially duplicated 5'  region. the duplication includes the highly conserved bidirectional promoter regulating brca <dig> and the adjacent gene nbr <dig>  a brca <dig> partial pseudogene, and nbr1/m17s <dig>  the number of nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee sequences at the brca <dig> locus is not remarkable,  <dig> %, and does not vary appreciably between the brca <dig> locus and the duplicated region. however, humans and chimpanzee sequences differ by an  <dig> kb insertion/deletion within the partially duplicated region. the deletion on the chimpanzee sequence prematurely truncates the nbr <dig> gene. the consequences to brca <dig> expression in chimpanzee of the truncation of the adjacent, co-regulated gene are not known. in mouse, the region is not duplicated and the bidirectional promoter co-regulates brca <dig> and nbr <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
the availability of the chimpanzee genome sequence provides an excellent opportunity to explore the genetic basis for some of the biological differences between human and our most closely related organism  <cit> . an striking finding in this regard is the observation that non-human primates show a lower incidence of cancer than humans, specifically for epithelial carcinomas  <cit> . to investigate if this different susceptibility to cancer was due to genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees, we performed a comparative analysis in the chimpanzee genome of a set of  <dig> human genes that have been directly implicated in tumor development  <cit> . this analysis revealed that all human cancer genes contain a clear ortholog in the chimpanzee genome, and show a percentage of identities at the protein level similar to the genome average . nevertheless, the strict conservation of this group of more than  <dig> genes contrasts with the recent analysis of other groups of genes, including a set of  <dig> proteases, which shows that at least  <dig> genes are absent in either human or chimpanzee genomes  <cit> , or the cd33-related siglecs, which also show specific loss of some genes in the human lineage  <cit> . these data suggest that despite cancer genes show a percentage of identities similar to the genome average, they are perfectly conserved between human and chimpanzee, confirming previous studies showing a higher conservation of genes implicated in essential cellular functions  <cit> .

this study has shown that despite the high degree of identity in cancer genes, there are  <dig> amino acid changes whose contribution to the different cancer susceptibility between human and chimpanzee should be further investigated. nevertheless, additional factors contributing to the observed differences could include changes in diet, lifestyle or exposure to mutagenic agents  <cit> ; physiological differences in immune system or in life expectancy and aging rates  <cit> ; variations in gene expression, alternative splicing or in dna methylation patterns  <cit> ; or alterations in other genes not analyzed in this study. in this regard, we must emphasize that we have compiled a group of  <dig> genes that are causally implicated in cancer development as a result of mutational analysis or owing to their participation in processes such as control of mitotic checkpoints, chromosomal stability or promoter methylation. this set of genes includes those annotated in a recent census of human cancer genes  <cit> , but also incorporates novel genes described to be mutated in human carcinomas  <cit> . however, the possibility that other yet unknown cancer-related genes are responsible for the different susceptibility to this disease between human and chimpanzee, cannot be ruled out.

in relation to the existence of functional differences in the immune system of human and non-human primates, it is now clear that the immune and inflammatory responses play important roles in cancer development and progression  <cit> . accordingly, structural and functional variations in genes associated with these processes might be responsible for the species-specific susceptibility to certain tumors. life expectancy is another factor that might contribute to the observed differences in cancer incidence between human and chimpanzee. although age is known to represent a major risk factor for cancer development, the observation that non-human primates have a lower incidence of epithelial carcinomas but not other cancers  <cit> , suggests that life expectancy might contribute only partially to the observed differences in cancer susceptibility. on the other hand, and despite the strong conservation in the coding regions of cancer genes from human and chimpanzee, it is possible that differences in regulatory elements outside these coding regions can result in changes in the expression levels or in the tissue distribution patterns  <cit> . in fact, recent reports have shown considerable differences in the expression levels of orthologous genes from different primate species  <cit> , supporting the idea that regulatory changes might account for some interspecies differences, including cancer susceptibility  <cit> .

despite the high conservation of cancer genes between both species, we identified  <dig> genes containing several codon insertions or deletions in their protein coding regions, although the functional significance of these differences, including their putative association with cancer, will require further studies. it is interesting to note that in 70% of these cases, the insertion/deletion event occurred within trinucleotide repeats, suggesting that these regions could be prone to genetic instability, in both human and chimpanzee genomes. analysis of est databases allowed us to confirm this hypothesis, as six human genes, aspscr <dig>  dek, fancc, mllt <dig>  myst <dig> and znf <dig>  were polymorphic in the number of repeats in these regions. in the case of genes implicated in cancer, it will also be interesting to study if some of the identified haplotypes could confer a higher risk of tumor development.

the fact that most cancer genes show a high degree of conservation between human and chimpanzee, prompted us to analyze in more detail the observed changes in genes previously reported to be of special relevance in human cancer, such as the tumor suppressors p <dig> and brca <dig>  we found that chimpanzee p <dig> shows a single amino acid difference with human p <dig>  resulting in a protein containing pro instead of arg at position  <dig>  interestingly, this codon is polymorphic in human, and the pro <dig> residue is common in all studied human populations  <cit> . sequencing of this region in other non-human primates allowed us to confirm that this pro residue has been conserved during evolution, and suggests that the arg <dig> allele, present in 55–92% of the human population, arose in the human lineage. the presence of pro <dig> in chimpanzee might have physiological consequences, as several reports have found interesting functional differences between both p <dig> isoforms. in fact, p53-arg <dig> protein has an increased ability to induce apoptosis, to translocate from the nucleus to the mitochondria, to be degraded by the e <dig> oncoprotein of human papillomavirus or to inactivate p <dig> when mutated  <cit> . different studies have provided evidence for an increasedrisk of cancer development associated with the arg <dig> genotype, although this topic has been controversial and further studies will be necessary to definitely address this question  <cit> . therefore, and although the presence of pro <dig> in chimpanzee p <dig> might contribute to the reduced cancer susceptibility in non-human primates, further work will be required to confirm this hypothesis.

analysis of the tumor suppressor brca <dig> has shown that it has been subjected to positive selection during recent hominoid evolution, as the overall ka/ks ratios are greater than one when comparing human and chimpanzee lineages, but not on lineages of other primates or mammals, as has been recently shown  <cit> . additionally, the chimpanzee brca <dig> locus contains an  <dig> kb deletion in the partially duplicated 5' region. this deletion prematurely truncates the nbr <dig> gene, which is regulated by a bi-directional promoter that co-regulates nbr <dig> and brca <dig>  the consequences to brca <dig> expression in chimpanzee of the truncation of the adjacent, co-regulated gene are not known. the distinctive evolution of human and chimpanzee brca <dig> suggest that an evolutionary approach may be important to understanding selection at this, and perhaps other cancer associated genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this work we have performed an analysis of a defined set of  <dig> genes to try to elucidate the molecular basis of human-chimpanzee differences in one aspect of significant biomedical relevance: the interspecies variability in cancer susceptibility. the overall picture emerging from this comparative analysis is one that reflects the high degree of conservation in this group of cancer genes, although specific differences in relevant genes such as p <dig> and brca <dig> can illuminate new functional and evolutionary aspects of these tumor-suppressor genes. altogether, the limited genetic variability found in this human-chimpanzee comparative analysis might contribute to the different cancer susceptibility between these closely related species. however, further investigations will be necessary to determine the influence of these genetic changes in cancer, or whether additional factors, such as changes in gene regulation, immune system genes, life expectancy or environmental influences, might also contribute to this process.
