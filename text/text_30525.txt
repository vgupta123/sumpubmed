BACKGROUND
during vertebrate embryogenesis the heart is the first organ to develop and achieve functionality. model organism studies have uncovered a number of genes such as nkx <dig> , which have important functions in early vertebrate myocardial development and differentiation  <cit> . despite an increasing body of data illuminating the roles played by several key genes during cardiac development, there is still much to learn about what other factors may be critical. the general stages of cardiac development are invariable throughout vertebrate model organisms where heart development has been examined, with zebrafish progressing through these stages at a particularly rapid rate  <cit> . during zebrafish cardiogenesis the heart cone is the first structure to form between 19- <dig> hpf, followed by the formation of a short cardiac tube lacking discrete chambers by  <dig> hpf. subsequently the cardiac tube lengthens and distinct ventricle and atrium chambers are discernable by  <dig> hpf with heart tube looping occurring around  <dig> hpf. a functional two chambered zebrafish heart is visible by  <dig> hpf  <cit> .

in a recent transcriptional profiling study, we compared the signatures of mouse embryonic stem cells as they were differentiated towards cardiac cell fates in an effort to uncover novel critical cardiac genes. in this initial study we described the cardiac developmental expression of  <dig> identified candidate genes with previously unknown roles in cardiogenesis. furthermore, nine of these transcripts were expressed in the forming cardiac crescent of the mouse embryo  <cit> , consistent with roles in the earliest stages of heart development. based on the early cardiac expression of these genes we predicted they likely play significant roles in heart development.

in this paper we report functional evaluation of one of these genes, rbm <dig>  through the identification, characterization and knockdown of its zebrafish  orthologs. rbm <dig> is a member of the rna binding protein family, based upon the identification of a rna recognition motif  in amino acid residues 12- <dig>  rrms are the most common and best characterized rna binding modules with many functioning in most post-transcriptional processes  <cit> . the rrm is composed of four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets with two helices packed against it such that the domain has the split αβ  topology  <cit> . often, rrms function in concert to increase binding specificity possibly because the number of nucleotides recognized by a single rrm is generally too small to define a unique binding sequence  <cit> . rrms are found in a variety of rna binding proteins, including several hnrnp proteins, proteins implicated in regulation of alternative splicing, and protein components of snrnps indicating a diverse role of these motifs in cellular development and function.

as we have shown previously, the mouse rbm <dig> transcript is upregulated in the cardiac progenitor population and is expressed from the earliest stages of cardiac specification, in the cardiac crescent, and subsequently within the heart tube and looping heart  <cit> . based upon these observations we hypothesized that rbm <dig> plays a crucial role in cardiogenesis. in this study we investigated the putative role of rbm <dig> in cardiac development. we have identified two rbm <dig> zebrafish orthologs , and demonstrate that their spatial expression is consistent with our observations in mice. we use rbm24a and rbm24b translation blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotides  in the early embryo and demonstrate that each zebrafish rbm <dig> ortholog has a key but unequal role to play in cardiac development. additionally, we demonstrate a role for rbm24a and rbm24b in normal vascular development. vascular development consists of vasculogenesis which is the de novo formation of the first vascular vessels and subsequently angiogenesis which is the formation of additional vasculature as extensions of existing vasculature. zebrafish vasculogenesis results in the formation of the main trunk vessels with the da first to form  followed by the cv and pcv  and several heart vessels generating the first single circulation loop. angiogenesis can be observed in the trunk by  <dig> hpf as intersegmetal vessels  begin to form as paired dorsally extending branches off the da and subsequently off the pcv . as the se reach the dorsal line of the embryo the ends of the vessels form connections resulting in two dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels  running along the anterior-posterior  axis of the embryo at the dorsal line. by  <dig> hpf these trunk vessels are fully formed with circulation  <cit> . our findings show the requirement for rbm24a and rbm24b in cardiac development and vasculogenesis with a more pronounced role for rbm24a, and an additional putative role for rbm24a in angiogenesis.

RESULTS
phylogenetic comparative analysis establishes two rbm <dig> orthologs in zebrafish
we recently reported the identification of rbm <dig> as one of a number of novel transcripts discretely expressed in the earliest stages of cardiac development in the mouse embryo  <cit> . to facilitate determination of the biological requirement for this gene during vertebrate embryonic development, we first set out to identify the orthologous gene/s in zebrafish. in the transition between assembly zv <dig> and zv <dig> of the zebrafish genome, first one and then a second putative rbm <dig> ortholog was identified. the current assembly  identifies a protein coding gene as rbm24a residing on chromosome  <dig> and also a novel annotation of a putative rbm24b protein coding gene residing on chromosome  <dig>  to confirm the validity of these most recent changes to the genome annotation we compared these findings to our own comparative genomic analyses.

the first annotated rbm24a gene encodes a protein that displays strong similarity to the mouse rbm <dig>  amino acids). using the mouse rbm <dig> as a blastp query to search the ncbi refseq database of d. rerio proteins we detected strong similarity ) to a hypothetical protein loc <dig> encoded by a gene  on chromosome  <dig> . this protein is now termed rbm24b in zv <dig>  the identification of these genes as rbm <dig> orthologs is further supported by the identification of a pair of annotated rbm <dig> paralogs in both the medaka  and pufferfish  genomes. zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  where rbm24a resides, shares a common evolutionary origin with o. latipes chromosome  <dig> and t. nigroviridis chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in o. latipes and t. nigroviridis, respectively, map to the rbm24b region of chromosome  <dig> in d. rerio.

rbm24a and rbm24b display cardiovascular expression during embryogenesis
the spatial and temporal expression of both rbm <dig> orthologs was determined using rna in situ hybridization  . both rbm <dig> orthologs show cardiac expression early in development. at  <dig>  hpf we detected rbm24a but not rbm24b expression in myocardial precursor cells . by  <dig> hpf both rbm24a and rbm24b expression was detected in the forming heart . expression of rbm24a was also detected in the lens of the eye. by  <dig> hpf, and continuing through  <dig> hpf, rbm24a and rbm24b exhibit broad expression throughout the heart, although expression of rbm24a was higher in the atrium than the ventricle. by contrast expression of rbm24b appeared uniformly expressed in both heart chambers . these data are consistent with cardiac expression of the mouse rbm <dig> ortholog, and suggest incompletely overlapping requirements for rbm24a and rbm24b during zebrafish cardiac development.

by  <dig> hpf both rbm24a and rbm24b show incompletely overlapping vascular expression in addition to cardiac expression. rbm24a is expressed in the da and intestinal vasculature  while rbm24b is expressed in the pcv as well as the iv . the early expression of both rbm24a and rbm24b in both the heart and vasculature suggests potentially important roles in cardiogenesis and vasculogenesis.

rbm24a and rbm24b are required for normal cardiac development
to determine the functional role of the rbm <dig> orthologs in cardiac and vascular development, translation blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotides  were designed against the 5' utr of each transcript. the effects of gene knockdown was assessed for each ortholog individually post microinjection of either mo into zebrafish embryos at the 1- <dig> cell stage. titration experiments were conducted to determine mo quantities sufficient to induce a consistent phenotype in a majority of embryos injected . injection of  <dig> ng of rbm24a mo or  <dig> ng rbm24b mo resulted in a robust cardiac phenotype for a significant number of injected embryos at  <dig> hpf  , compared to uninjected embryos . during cardiogenesis the heart tubes of all affected morphant embryos failed to correctly loop, remaining linear but with distinct ventricular and atrial chambers . affected embryos also exhibited reduced blood circulation, which led to cardiac edema in all cases by  <dig> hpf and continually worsened as development progressed . a subset of rbm24a mo treated embryos  displayed an even more severe phenotype, lacking a distinct heart tube and exhibiting a beating focus of periodically contracting cells. this poorly organized cardiac structure was located ventral to the embryo between the embryo and the yolk suggesting a defect in the migration and organization of the cardiac fated cells. similarly reduction of rbm24a or rbm24b expression using splice blocking morpholinos, designed against the second intron/exon boundary, also resulted in cardiac looping defects and cardiac edema in a majority of embryos  . knockdown efficiency was evaluated by rt-pcr for embryos displaying cardiac looping defects and cardiac edema after injection with splice blocking morpholino. both rbm24a and rbm24b transcript levels were significantly reduced to  <dig> % +/-  <dig> , p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig> % +/-  <dig> , p <  <dig>  × 10- <dig> of transcript levels in respective uninjected controls . we used translation blocking mo in all subsequent mo-based experiments due to their greater efficacy.

to confirm the phenotype observed in the rbm <dig> morphants was not due to non-specific morpholino toxicity, embryos were co-injected with p <dig> morpholino and rbm24a mo or rbm24b mo . the cardiac phenotypes remained unchanged in the presence of the p <dig> morpholino . we then performed phenotype rescue for both rbm <dig> morphants to determine the sequence specificity of the observed morphant phenotypes. we generated full length capped poly-a rna transcripts for each ortholog and co-injected each along with the respective rbm <dig> mo, directed against the 5'utr not present in the in vitro transcribed rna. rescue for rbm24a mo was achieved with  <dig> pg of rna  while  <dig> pg of rna was sufficient for rbm24b mo rescue . for both orthologs rescue resulted in properly looped hearts, normal systemic circulation and an absence of cardiac edema and by  <dig> hpf and continuing to  <dig> hpf . taken collectively, these data suggest the phenotype seen with each rbm <dig> mo is a specific result of reduction in gene expression and support the inference from ish expression data that both rbm <dig> orthologs are required for normal cardiac development.

depletion of rbm24a and rbm24b compromise cardiac myocardium development
to better evaluate the impact to the heart of reducing rbm24a or rbm24b we assayed the expression of several key myocardial transcripts by ish, including myosin light polypeptide  <dig>  myl <dig> , myosin heavy polypeptide  <dig>  myh <dig>  and ventricular myosin heavy chain, vmhc . expression of each marker was evaluated in control , rbm24a mo and rbm24b mo injected embryos fixed at  <dig> hpf at which point the zebrafish heart is normally, looped, fully developed and functioning, allowing us to comment in greater detail on the structural deficits contributing to the gross morphological morphant phenotypes. when examining the entire heart, both rbm24a and rbm24b morphant embryos exhibit strong myl <dig> expression levels comparable to that of controls albeit within an unlooped heart tube. the hearts of controls by contrast are appropriately looped . additionally in rbm24a morphants defects of the presumptive atrium of the forming heart tube appear more severe than in the ventricular portion . by contrast organization of the developing ventricle and atrium in rbm24b mo embryos appears equally compromised . expression of the atrial marker myh <dig> for both rbm <dig> morphants appears qualitatively similar to levels in uninjected controls. presumptive atria of rbm24a morphant heart tubes appear linear and truncated, while to rbm24b morphants also have linear longer heart tubes, both contrasting with the looped atrium observed in uninjected controls . these data are consistent with the observations that rbm24a expression was higher in the atrium than the ventricle by  <dig> hpf, contrasting with the more uniform expression observed for rbm24b across both heart chambers .

both rbm <dig> morphant conditions exhibited a near abrogation of the levels of the ventricular marker vmhc compared to strong expression in uninjected controls . in rbm24a mo morphants expression of vmhc was faint but with expression clearly bounded to the heart tube with a clear ventricular portion; however, the expression uncharacteristically extended beyond the ventricular portion into the presumptive atrium of the heart tube . for rbm24b morphants vmhc expression was very diffuse and failed to clearly mark a ventricular boundary. these findings for vmhc expression were unexpected; both in the reduction of total expression seen for both rbm <dig> morphants and the apparent stronger severity of the ventricular phenotype compared to the atrial phenotype for both rbm <dig> morphants. taken together the expression of these markers highlight the differential spatial impact of each rbm <dig> ortholog in heart structure development of the myocardium, and is consistent with our previous gross morphological observations. these data indicate an incompletely overlapping role for rbm24a and rbm24b in heart tube formation and subsequent heart looping.

edema in morphant embryos may have multiple origins
the observed cardiac edema may result from reduced circulation as a consequence of defects in heart structure, heart rate, aberrant vasculature or combinations of these factors. given the observed structural defects, we additionally assayed heart rate as a potential contributor to cardiac edema in the rbm24a mo and rbm24b mo injected embryos  <cit> . heart rate counts were determined for uninjected, rbm24a mo and rbm24b mo injected embryos  at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpf. at  <dig> hpf both rbm24a and rbm24b morphants displayed significantly lower heart rate compared to uninjected controls  . heart rates in rbm24a mo injected embryos remain significantly lower than uninjected controls at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. by contrast the heart rate of rbm24b mo injected embryos recovered such that it did not differ significantly from uninjected controls at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf  despite their continued structural anomalies. these data demonstrate cardiac edema is not ameliorated in rbm24b morphants despite heart rates increasing to normal levels, suggesting the role of other factors must be considered as contributing to compromised circulation. although defects in structure and rates of contraction may contribute to compromised circulatory function, we posit that vascular disruption likely also plays a role in the resulting edema.

rbm24a and rbm24b are required for normal vasculogenesis with a potential role in early angiogenesis
to determine the functional role of rbm24a and rbm24b in vascular development we also undertook mo-based analyses of each ortholog in the tg transgenic zebrafish reporter line which fluorescently marks all endothelial cells highlighting the forming cardiovascular structures  <cit> . embryos were examined for vascular expression, after injection of rbm24a mo or rbm24b mo as described above, after heart formation and completion of vasculogenesis at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . as per our earlier experiments, morphant embryos for both genes exhibit endocardial cardiac edema and a lack of heart looping displaying little to no circulation with 30/ <dig> and 45/ <dig> embryos displaying cardiac defects for rbm24a and rbm24b morphants respectively . additionally, all rbm24a and rbm24b morphant embryos display a reduction in total trunk vasculature and vascular organization in 100% of the embryos ; however vasculogenic and angiogenic vessels are disrupted to differing degrees. at  <dig> hpf rbm24a morphants posses a clearly present pcv appearing thicker than normal with no detectable da or cv . angiogenesis is severely disrupted in these embryos with unpaired stunted dysmorphic se also appearing thicker extending only to the midline of the embryo and thus a complete lack of dlavs. by contrast the rbm24b morphant at  <dig> hpf shows little to no disruption of the da, a visible but malformed cv and no detectable pcv . unlike rbm24a morphants, rbm24b morphants have less disruption of angiogenesis. se in rbm24b morphants display pairing at the posterior end of the embryo and extend dorsally the length of the embryo forming one dlav; however, all these vessels are structurally dysmorphic. both rbm24a and rbm24b vascular morphant phenotypes become progressively more severe between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. vessels are less well organized and the number of vessels present is reduced, with no evidence of iv . of the morphant embryos displaying cardiac defects rbm24a and rbm24b morphants segregated into different classes of vascular defects, with 31/ <dig> rbm24a morphants analyzed possessing disorganized trunk vasculature where se do not extend the entire dorsal length of the embryo and the da and cv are undetectable; and 50/ <dig> rbm24b morphants had disorganized trunk vasculature where the se formed dlav and yet the pv was undetectable . these data correlate with respective primary vascular expression locations of rbm24a of da and rbm24b of pcv and both displaying expression in the iv . when expression of rbm24a or rbm24b is compromised formation of the vessels required for the initial circulation loop is similarly compromised, likely contributing significantly to the observed cardiac edema in morphant embryos. these findings indicate the endocardium is also compromised as a result of rbm <dig> knockdown and also suggests that both rbm24a and rbm24b are independently necessary for normal early vascular development and support a putative role for rbm24a in angiogenesis.

rbm24a and rbm24b exhibit incompletely overlapping functions in zebrafish development
to determine whether rbm24a and rbm24b interact genetically in the developing zebrafish embryo, we injected low doses of both rbm24a and rbm24b mos into the same embryo. although each mo dosage amount was too low  to elicit a strong consistent phenotype alone as evidenced by titration experiments , a much more severe phenotype resulted in the morphants receiving both mos in concert . the double morphants displayed greater cardiac edema at  <dig> hpf than either morphant alone . by  <dig> hpf, the double morphants also displayed very little cardiac organization, with most  failing to form any heart tube structure. no double morphants displayed any circulation . this severe and distinctive phenotype exceeds that observed for either mo when assayed independently, even at the higher concentrations that yield consistent cardiac defects . these data support the possibility that roles for rbm <dig> orthologs may overlap during cardiovascular development.

discussion
rbm <dig> is a novel cardiac gene candidate identified through transcript profiling of differentiating mescs  <cit> . it was initially selected for functional analysis due to its early cardiac expression during mouse development, first detected by in situ hybridization in the cardiac crescent of mice, and subsequently in the heart tube and looping heart.

we integrated syntenic and sequence-based comparative genomic analyses to identify two rbm <dig> orthologs in zebrafish, establishing that their expression was concordant with our earlier observations in mice. in the zebrafish embryo, a reduction of either rbm <dig> ortholog expression by injection of morpholinos results in cardiac looping defects and reduced circulation. these embryos later exhibit cardiac edema and distention as early as  <dig> hpf, but this is likely a secondary effect of reduced rbm <dig> expression, due instead to reduced circulation  <cit> . our data suggests that reduced circulation is likely due to a reduction in critical vasculature and not simply reduced heart rate. additionally, reduction of either rbm24a or rbm24b independently yielded vascular defects of both myocardium and endocardium. we exclude general toxicity or off target effects as the cause of the observed morphant phenotype by confirming they remain without amelioration in the presence of p <dig> mo. we also confirmed the morphant phenotypes are sequence-specific by successfully achieving rna-based phenotype rescue.

investigation of molecular markers for myocardial development further illuminated the impact of reducing rbm <dig> expression. both rbm <dig> orthologs are detected in the developing heart by in situ hybridization by  <dig> hpf and sustain expression at least through  <dig> hpf. in all cases a reduction of rbm24a or rbm24b was sufficient to prevent heart looping noted at  <dig> hpf and beyond, where normal heart looping occurs at approximately  <dig> hpf. expression of rbm24a is unequal between the ventricle and atrium with stronger expression in the atrium while rbm24b shows equivalent expression in both chambers. this skewed expression of rbm24a at higher levels in the atrium is illustrated by truncated and abnormal atrium formation of the developing heart in rbm24a mo injected embryos demonstrating its requirement for cardiogenesis, including atrial specification, at this early stage. a reduction in either rbm <dig> ortholog severely disrupts the expression level and localization of ventricular marker vmhc yielding little to no expression visible in either rbm <dig> morphant condition. reduced ventricular myocardial count disproportionate to the atrium has also been reported with deficient nkx and hedgehog signaling  <cit> . although reduction of each rbm <dig> results in incompletely overlapping atrial and ventricular phenotypes, reduction of either is sufficient to compromise the looping of the heart tube. the looping of the heart tube is a result of both genetic and biophysical mechanisms, and perturbation of the mechanical force generated by the contraction of the heart chambers can affect proper heart formation  <cit> . zebrafish wea mutants , display distortions in cardiac looping, but still maintain a functional circulatory system due to the adaptation of the ventricle  <cit> . this suggests that reduction in rbm24a expression impacts both the ventricle and atrium, likely in the organization or structure of the muscle filaments, in addition to cardiomyocyte count, in turn affecting the ability of the heart to circulate blood.

although both rbm24a mo and rbm24b mo injected embryos display an additional phenotype of aberrant vascular morphology, with defects in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis the defect in rbm24a morphants appears more severe. the observed phenotypes, however, are also consistent with the exhibited localization of each rbm <dig> ortholog, wherein rbm24a is expressed in the da and rbm24b is expressed in the pcv by  <dig> hpf. the expression difference likely reflects the acquisition of independent roles since duplication of the ancestral gene  <cit> , resulting in incompletely overlapping functions for these orthologs in vasculogenesis. angiogenesis is impaired when expression of either rbm <dig> ortholog is reduced. the integrity of these first vessesls of angiogenesis  deteriorates over time. in rbm24a morphants se are more severely affected not reaching the dorsal line to form dlavs at  <dig> hpf and continue to deteriorate by  <dig> hpf. this may result form the lack of any discernable da. rbm24b morphants still possessed a visible da but no pcv, se and one dlav were present and only displayed mild morphology alterations at  <dig> hpf with subsequent severe deterioration by  <dig> hpf. in the case of all rbm <dig> morphants there is an inability to maintain the new vessels formed during angiogenesis and a wasting of any vessels resulting from vasculogenesis. it is unclear the molecular basis of this blood vessel deterioration. normal rbm <dig> expression may be playing a direct role in the vascular maintenance or the angiogenesis pathway. also to be considered is that a lack of sufficient concentrations of growth factors and mitogens due to insufficient circulation may be preventing maintenance of initiated vasculature, since it has been shown se sprouting and extension involves several rounds of cell division  <cit>  and vegfa is required for vascular maintenance  <cit> .

the incompletely overlapping role of rbm24a and rbm24b in the developing heart and vasculature is underscored by the extreme phenotype observed in the double morpholino injections. rbm24a and rbm24b appear to act in parallel in cardiac development, converging on a common phenotype for which they are both overtly required. by contrast in vasculogenesis, rbm24a and rbm24b appear to function in parallel but differentially in artery and vein formation, resulting in different vascular phenotypes which are individually sufficient to disrupt formation of the initial embryonic circulation loop. further analyses will be required to determine the mechanistic role played by rbm24a/b and whether their roles involve one or all of the above-discussed mechanisms.

the critical role for rbm <dig> in cardiogenesis raises the question whether mutations at the orthologous human locus may contribute to cardiac disorders. interestingly, wessels et al. recently identified a novel cardiac syndrome with noncompaction cardiomyopathy, bradycardia, pulmonary stenosis, atrial septal defects, and heterotaxy with genetic linkage to human chromosome 6p  <cit> . genome-wide linkage analysis localized the implicated interval to chromosome 6p <dig> - <dig> , a region encompassing the human rbm <dig> ortholog , making it an ideal candidate for variation underlying this phenotype. however, sequencing of all rbm <dig> coding exons, intron/exon boundaries and the upstream promoter region in two affecteds, revealed only known polymorphisms  that were also observed in a heterozygous state in an unaffected family member. while we can exclude a role for rbm <dig> coding mutations, additional sequencing of putative regulatory sequences will be necessary to determine if rbm <dig> may play a role in this syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide significant insight into the role of rbm <dig> in formation of cardiac and vascular systems, however much remains to be learned about the exact mechanism by which it functions and the role rbm <dig> may play in human disease. other rrm containing proteins have also been shown to serve important roles in embryonic development  <cit>  and post-transcriptional regulation is a frequent theme. with this in mind, we hypothesize that the protein plays a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression important for cardiac and vascular development. in the case of rbm24a and rbm24b depletion for instance, we found that expression of the ventricular marker vmhc is nearly abolished in the heart at  <dig> hpf, suggesting they both may contribute to specific regulation of vmhc mrna. we will continue elucidate the role and mechanisms of rbm <dig> function in embryonic development. furthermore, this study demonstrates the power of the screen that uncovered rbm <dig> as a candidate cardiac gene, adding significant value to the original data set for which this work represents just the first of many such analyses awaiting completion.
