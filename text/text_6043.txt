BACKGROUND
fusarium verticillioides  nirenberg  is a fungal pathogen that causes severe stalk rot and ear rot of maize and it is found in plant residues in almost every maize field at harvest  <cit> . in southern europe, f. verticillioides is the prevalent species in maize fields and it is the main causal agent of fusarium ear rot  <cit> . f. verticillioides is associated with maize in most stages of this plant’s growth cycle. the fungus is both a parasite and a saprophyte. under ordinary plant growth condition, the hemibiotrophic f. verticillioides grows within the maize plant as an endophyte. symptoms vary greatly depending upon plant genotype, environment and disease severity  <cit> . interest in f. verticillioides is intense because the fungus can produce fumonisins as secondary metabolites, a family of mycotoxins affecting animal and human health  <cit> . disease control by chemical and agronomic approaches is often ineffective and increases the cost of production  <cit> . for this reason host resistance is the most durable and sustainable method to reduce losses.

several studies reveal that genetic variation for fusarium ear rot resistance and fumonisin contamination exists among hybrids and inbred lines of field maize  <cit> . however, there is no evidence of complete resistance to either trait in maize. fusarium ear rot resistance is under polygenic control and strongly influenced by environmental factors  <cit> . the complexity of this trait has hampered breeding for resistance, therefore most commercial maize hybrids are susceptible  <cit> . however, screening trials performed for both fusarium ear rot and fumonisin contamination using public and private inbred lines identified several lines and hybrids with good levels of resistance to both fusarium ear rot and fumonisin accumulation  <cit> .

linkage-based mapping studies in biparental populations have shown that quantitative trait loci  to fusarium ear rot resistance have relatively small effects and are not consistent between populations . we previously constructed a genetic linkage map by using single nucleotide polymorphism  markers, generated from genotyping by sequencing  technology . markers were developed on the segregating population derived from the cross between co <dig> and co <dig> maize lines, previously classified as resistant and susceptible to fusarium ear rot  <cit> . progress in breeding for resistance will be speeded up by analysis of new and consistent qtls for fusarium ear rot resistance and fumonisin accumulation and by a deeper knowledge of genetic mechanisms underlying maize-f. verticillioides interactions.

large studies on model species have clarified some crucial events in plant resistance. plants have evolved two defense mechanisms to resist pathogen invasion that involve different strategies of detecting pathogens. on the extracellular face of the host cell, pathogen associated molecular patterns  are recognized by pattern recognition receptors  and the subsequent stimulation of pprs leads to pamp-triggered immunity   <cit> . its induction leads to mitogen activated protein kinases  and calcium signaling, transcription of pathogen-responsive genes, production of reactive oxygen species  and deposition of callose to reinforce the cell wall at sites of infection  <cit> . furthermore, plants have evolved a more specialized defense mechanism towards successful pathogens, the effector-triggered immunity , which acts largely inside the cell and involves the recognition of pathogen delivered effectors contributing to pathogen virulence by plant resistance  proteins. eti is an accelerated and amplified pti response, resulting in disease resistance and, usually, a hypersensitive cell death response  at the infection site. following the early signaling events activated by pathogen attack, elicitor signals are often amplified through the generation of secondary signal molecules, such as salicylic acid , ethylene  and jasmonates . however, cross talk and synergistic effects between the defense pathways mediated by sa and ja/et during different pathogenic infections has been proposed  <cit> . furthermore, in several plant-pathogen interactions, the defense response has been associated with the accumulation of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and phytoalexins  <cit> . in maize, upon fungal inoculation, induction of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin flavonoids was observed in silks and kernels of resistant lines, suggesting a role for this compound in resistance to f. verticillioides  <cit> . in addition, elevation of phenylpropanoids in the maize kernel pericarp is a trait associated with lower disease severity and fumonisin accumulation caused by f. verticillioides  <cit> .

microarray analysis was previously applied to characterize f. verticillioides-maize interaction  <cit> . we reported that defense responses involved changes in the expression of a large number of genes in seeds of susceptible  and resistant  maize genotypes. however, in the resistant line, the expression of defense-related genes was observed before inoculation, while in the susceptible genotype defense genes were induced only after pathogen attack. the study was extended to the analysis of enzymes involved in removal of ros, namely ascorbate peroxidase , catalase , peroxidase  and superoxide dismutase   <cit> . in resistant seedlings, before infection, apx and sod enzymatic activities were higher compared to the susceptible ones, while after 5 days, they remained unchanged. on the other hand, in the susceptible seedlings all enzymes assayed were activated only after f. verticillioides inoculation. these findings supported the hypothesis of a basal defense response provided by the resistant genotype in maize both in kernels and seedlings.

rna-seq is increasingly being used for global gene expression profiling in plants  <cit>  as it provides significant advantages over traditional microarray analysis: e.g. accurate absolute quantification of expression data, high sensitivity and reproducibility for both technical and biological replicates, broader capability of detecting differential expression over a large dynamic range as well as the possibility of detecting novel expressed genes  <cit> . recent studies have described the rna-seq technology use in maize  <cit> , nevertheless this approach has never been used to compare defense responses to pathogens in resistant vs. susceptible maize genotypes.

in this work, rna-seq was used to identify the early transcriptional changes in both resistant co <dig> and susceptible co <dig> genotypes responding to f. verticillioides inoculation. it was observed that co <dig> response was characterized not only by a constitutive expression, but also by a prompt and enhanced induction of some key genes associated with resistance mechanisms, antioxidant process, hormone signaling, signal transduction cascades and secondary metabolism. these findings will provide valuable candidate genes that could be used to develop fusarium ear rot-resistant maize genotypes.

RESULTS
f. verticillioidesgrowth on co <dig> and co <dig> maize genotypes
the two maize inbreds co <dig> and co <dig>  previously classified as resistant and susceptible to f. verticillioides according to their field behavior and growth assay by absolute quantification of the fungal β-tubulin <dig>  transcript through real-time rt-pcr analysis, were used in this study  <cit> . infection progression in the area surrounding f. verticillioides inoculated kernels was monitored in the early stages of infection over a time course of 96 hours. the tub <dig> transcript was detected in kernels of susceptible and resistant genotypes at  <dig> through 96 hours post inoculation . the highest transcript copy number was found at  <dig> hpi in both genotypes, although in the resistant line co <dig> gene copy number was about twenty-nine times lower compared to the susceptible line co <dig> . this profile was indicative of stronger resistance mechanisms in co <dig> genotype, still active at  <dig> hpi, and for this reason  <dig> hpi was chosen as the relevant time-point to perform rna-seq analysis.table  <dig>

transcriptome sequencing of uninoculated and f. verticillioidesinoculated co <dig> and co <dig> maize kernels
transcriptome sequencing of libraries obtained from resistant and susceptible maize kernels either uninoculated or inoculated produced  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end 100 bp reads, respectively, corresponding to about  <dig>  gbps and  <dig>  gbps . on average 74% of the total reads mapped to maize inbred b <dig> reference genome sequence , with most of the reads mapping to exons  and only a small proportion mapping to introns  and intergenic regions . gene expression levels were quantified by using the maize b <dig> as reference genome and the abundance of each transcript was expressed as fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads  as implemented by cufflinks  <cit> . we detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  known protein coding genes  expressed at a fpkm level >  <dig>  in the co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes, respectively, out of which ~75% in the filtered gene set  . in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig>  putative novel expressed loci were found in each of these genotypes, representing potentially important new information for genome annotation . raw counts expression data showed a pearson’s correlation among biological replicates > <dig>  for all the samples analyzed, indicating high correlation between sequencing replicates.figure  <dig>

expression profiles of inoculated co <dig> and co <dig> were compared with the respective uninoculated controls, while basal differences were investigated by comparing uninoculated co <dig> and co <dig> samples. genes were defined as differentially expressed genes  with a false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig>  and a log <dig> fold-change  ≥ <dig>  <cit> . transcriptome analysis revealed a total number of  <dig>  degs, grouped into  <dig> clusters based on their expression profiles . to gain insights into the functionality of the genes with constitutive differences and responsive to f. verticillioides inoculation degs were annotated with blast2go software  <cit>  and classified in  <dig> functional categories.

intergenotypes differences in basal gene expression
basal level differences between the resistant and susceptible genotypes were explored by comparing uninoculated co <dig> and co <dig> control samples . differential expression analysis revealed  <dig>  significantly degs , 73% of which were more abundant in the resistant genotype. as the higher resistance of co <dig> inbred line to f. verticillioides might reflect the presence of stronger constitutive physical or chemical barriers  <cit> , we focused on genes belonging to defense-related functional classes, as resistance, response to stress, cell wall and secondary metabolism. in particular we found that 86% of degs belonging to secondary metabolism functional class were up-regulated in co <dig> line and down-regulated in co <dig> line. moreover, out of  <dig>  degs between the genotypes,  <dig> genes expressed at low level in co <dig>  had a much higher expression value in co <dig>  ranging from  <dig> fpkm to ~ <dig> fpkm. on the contrary, only  <dig> genes expressed at low level in co <dig>  were expressed more than  <dig> fpkm in co <dig>  in particular, by applying these criteria, the two functional categories secondary metabolism and transport displayed only co441-specific genes .table  <dig>

the table shows the total number of genes whose basal expression is higher in the resistant co <dig> or susceptible co <dig> genotype within each category, considering the following filters: fpkm > <dig> in co <dig> and 0 ≤ fpkm < <dig>  in co <dig>  and fpkm >  <dig> in co <dig> and 0 ≤ fpkm <  <dig>  in co <dig>  respectively. defense-related genes considered for the comparison are those functionally categorized as ‘cell wall’, ‘resistance’, ‘response to stress’ and ‘secondary metabolism’.



overall, these data show that degs belonging to all functional classes were mainly over-expressed in co <dig> genotype compared to co <dig> at basal level, and in particular for the secondary metabolism category, suggesting that the resistance to f. verticillioides infection in this genotype could be potentially related to the constitutive expression of secondary metabolism-related genes .

transcriptional changes in response to f. verticillioidesinoculation
transcriptional changes induced by f. verticillioides in susceptible and resistant genotypes were determined by comparing inoculated samples at  <dig> hpi with uninoculated control samples and degs are shown in figure  <dig> . a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   genes distributed in the different functional classes were found as differentially regulated after f. verticillioides inoculation in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively . in both lines, the majority of modulated transcripts was up-regulated, although in the susceptible genotype a higher percentage of pathogen-induced genes was detected . the amount of genes for each functional category whose modulation in response to inoculation was common to both genotypes, or restricted to one or the other, is reported in figure  <dig>  although genotype-specific transcriptional changes were found, genes modulated in both genotypes represent an important proportion  in nearly all different functional classes, indicating a certain level of conservation in pathogen response.figure  <dig> 
specificity of transcriptional changes in inoculated co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes within functional categories. proportion of genes modulated in co <dig>  and co <dig>  or in both genotypes  at  <dig> hpi.



common transcriptional changes in response to inoculation
a total of  <dig>  degs were co-modulated in both genotypes. after discarding genes with unassigned function, the largest proportion of common genes was related to metabolic process , followed by genes involved in disease resistance , that included the categories: resistance , response to stress , secondary metabolism , and cell wall  . this class consisted of several modulated genes encoding chitinases, serine-protease inhibitors, glutathione s-transferases  and terpene synthases. although they were differentially regulated in both genotypes, important differences in the level of induction were especially notable for these genes . beside the disease resistance category, the next largest group of common transcripts was related to signal transduction . this group included many genes encoding wrky, nac and myb transcription factors , which were much more strongly induced in co <dig> . in line with this, if we considered the average of inoculated fpkm values for each functional category, expression levels of common degs were found invariably much higher in co <dig> and the three classes with the higher average fpkm values were: resistance, secondary metabolism and response to stress . by visualizing common degs in both genotypes related to biotic stress processes again a response with higher magnitude was detected in co <dig> compared to co <dig> genotype in nearly all considered categories . therefore, even if a certain number of genes was found to be modulated by the f. verticillioides in both genotypes, an enhanced response was observed in the resistant genotype mainly affecting defense-related genes.figure  <dig>

genotype-specific transcriptional changes in response to inoculation
specific transcriptional changes induced by f. verticillioides included  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes found as differentially regulated in co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes, respectively . the most prevalent functional categories among the modulated genes were metabolic process  and signal transduction  for both maize lines . the category of defense-related genes followed with a higher percentage of degs for the resistant genotype . these percentages were lower in comparison to the percentage of defense-related degs found in common transcriptional changes , suggesting that most of plant responses to pathogen were in common to co <dig> and co <dig> lines, although with an enhanced reaction in the resistant genotype . in addition, average fpkm values in inoculated kernels for both genotype-specific degs decreased compared to common transcriptional changes. however higher average fpkm values upon inoculation were observed in co <dig> compared to co <dig>  in particular for defense-related categories, where the inoculated resistant line showed, in average, fpkm expression values of ~ <dig>  against fpkm values of ~ <dig> in the susceptible genotype. the highest difference was observed again in secondary metabolism category . specific genes involved in shikimate biosynthesis , phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  and lignin biosynthesis pathways  appeared to be strongly influenced by inoculation in co <dig> with up to ~12-fold induction. response to stress and resistance categories followed, as for common degs, where average fpkm expression values were 2– <dig> higher in the resistant genotype compared to the susceptible one. by visualizing transcriptional changes related to biotic stress processes, the same trend was observed and higher fpkm values were revealed in inoculated co <dig> sample compared to co <dig> . even though all these genes were well represented in both genotypes, it was observed that on the whole co <dig>  beside presenting higher basal expression level for many of these genes, shows an enhanced gene induction, confirming its strengthening also in the specific response to inoculation .figure  <dig>

validation of rna-seq data by real-time rt-pcr
to validate the rna-seq expression profiles of degs real-time rt-pcr was performed on  <dig> genes randomly selected for high or low fpkm expression levels. the comparison between the two techniques revealed a substantial agreement for all nine genes differentially expressed at basal level between co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes . generally, as predicted, the resistant genotype had higher expression levels before inoculation for all assayed genes, although rna-seq analysis displayed a higher dynamic range, showing larger differences between fpkm values compared to real-time rt-pcr.

real-time rt-pcr on twenty-four degs previously identified comparing inoculated plants with their respective controls and including both genes modulated in both genotypes and genotype-specific degs showed expression profiles consistent with the rna-seq data for twenty genes . the enhancement in expression levels and defense response revealed by rna-seq results in the resistant genotype was confirmed by the real-time rt-pcr, in line with an enhanced fusarium responsiveness at  <dig> hpi in this genotype.

identification of maize novel genes in response to f. verticillioidesinoculation
by mapping rna-seq reads against the maize b <dig> reference genome sequence, only a small portion of reads matched to intergenic regions, from which  <dig>  putative novel expressed loci were obtained in the co <dig> and co <dig> genotypes . to determine whether these genes encoded proteins, the coding potential of each contig was estimated using coding potential calculator   <cit> . cpc indicated that ~ <dig> % and ~ <dig> % of these novel expressed genes had a coding and a highly coding potential, respectively. as for known genes, novel genes with statistically significant differential expression were determined, resulting in  <dig> and  <dig> novel genes specifically regulated in co <dig> and co <dig>  respectively, and only  <dig> novel genes regulated in both genotypes by f. verticillioides inoculation . functional annotations revealed that although more than 80% of differentially expressed novel genes were uncharacterized proteins, 8% and 5% of total novel genes belonged to the categories metabolic process and signal transduction, respectively . interestingly, among differentially expressed novel genes an o-glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> protein  induced by pathogen in the susceptible genotype showed a high coding potential. the alignment of xloc_ <dig> and its corresponding transcript tcons_ <dig> were associated to annotated gene grmz5g <dig> . analyzing the protein sequence deriving from the gene grmz5g <dig>  we found that the annotated gene encoded a glycosyl hydrolase protein of  <dig> amino acids . on the other hand, the novel gene xloc_ <dig> encoded a 649-amino acids protein showing at the c terminus region the presence of catalytic domains × <dig> , possibly involved in cellulose binding, and lacking in the annotated gene grmz5g <dig>   <cit> . semi-quantitative rt-pcr confirmed the rna-seq identified transcript, suggesting that rna-seq method not only identifies novel genes, but also improves the annotation of incomplete or partially annotated known genes .

discussion
in order to extend our knowledge about the molecular changes produced by infection with one of the most important maize pathogens, f. verticillioides, we analysed differential gene expression induced by this pathogen using rna-seq technology in resistant and susceptible maize inbreds. although some of the mechanisms affecting disease resistance in earlier stages were evaluated in previous works by microarrays, this study reports on the first use of rna-seq related to the pathosystem f. verticillioides-maize.

expression of plant resistance genes
plants have evolved and adapted numerous defense mechanisms in response to a wide variety of pathogens. pathogen recognition involves two kinds of receptors: those located in the plasma membrane and those present in the cytoplasm. receptors located in the plasma membrane recognize conserved pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns  and belong to families of receptor-like kinases   <cit> . in our study rlk-leucine-rich repeat  protein kinases showing higher fpkm values in the co <dig> control kernels compared to co <dig> were identified, some of which retained similar fpkm values after f. verticillioides inoculation. additionally, some rlk-lrr kinases were up or down regulated upon inoculation either in both genotypes or specifically in one of them. in any case a stronger pathogen induced modulation was found in co <dig> and also rlk-lrr specifically induced in the susceptible genotype showed higher fpkm values in co <dig> than in co <dig> upon inoculation.

two genes encoding brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <dig>  precursor, a llr-rlk protein known to be associated with the receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive  <dig>  and required to mediate pamp induced immunity  <cit> , were induced by pathogen in both genotypes. interestingly a bak <dig> precursor was found specifically up-regulated in the resistant genotype , but not in the susceptible one . these results suggest that a difference in surveillance system exists between genotypes already at basal level. furthermore, even at  <dig> hpi some resistance-related receptors still retain activation capability especially in co <dig> genotype. this is not surprising if we consider that sampling included kernels surrounding the inoculation point. nucleotide binding site -lrr proteins encoding for r  genes act as the second layer of active plant immunity in the cytosol  <cit> . a number of nbs-lrr encoding transcripts were also found among degs, with similarity mainly to rpm <dig> or rpp <dig>  presenting an analogous induction pattern as rlk-lrr. this indicates therefore the possible involvement of r genes at some stages of this interaction.

downstream signaling networks are triggered by pathogen recognition and mediated by protein kinases , especially calcium-activated pks  and mapk, that control defense responses . consistent with this widely accepted model, we detected an huge array of genes encoding for pk modulated by the inoculation, as well as cipk/cdpk, mapk and snf1-related pk. interestingly, four cdpks family members presented a strong modulation among the two genotypes , and further additional cdpks modulated their expression upon inoculation mainly in co <dig> 

calcium homeostasis regulators  involved in defense  <cit>  also changed their expression mainly in f. verticillioides co <dig> inoculated kernels. in arabidopsis, plants pathogen perception leads to the activation of two independent mapk cascades, the mekk1-mkk4/mkk5-mpk3mpk <dig> cascade and the mekk1-mkk1/mkk2-mpk <dig> cascade  <cit> . in this study, homologs of atmkk <dig> and atmkk <dig> were induced in both genotypes upon inoculation, and interestingly the atmkk <dig>  was found more induced in the co <dig> genotype, supporting its involvement in co441-mediated resistance to f. verticillioides.

finally, some gtp-signaling related genes were differentially regulated according to the rna-seq analysis. in particular, four of them showed a higher expression at basal level in the co <dig> genotype, providing additional support to g-protein association with defense responses in maize in line with previous studies .

beside genes encoding for proteins involved in signaling, a high number of genes representing most of the  <dig> different pathogenesis-related  classes were clearly identified as induced upon infection often shared by both genotypes. finally, among bowman-birk protease inhibitors, which are typically modulated by ja in plant defense to regulate both endogenous as well as pathogen protease activity  <cit> , five serine-protease inhibitors were detected as strongly induced and presenting very high level of expression. two of them were induced by the pathogen only in the resistant genotype, while the remaining were differentially regulated in both genotypes, but with different values . these data confirm the relevant role of proteinase inhibitors by helping to arrest pathogen invasions inhibiting proteolysis and thereby limiting availability of amino acids for growth and multiplication of the pathogen, especially for the resistant genotype.

pamps and mamps recognition is known to induce rapid production of ros, affecting cellular oxidation state. induction of gst is a widely recognized marker for ros accumulation during defense . a suite of twenty-three gst genes were up-regulated at  <dig> hpi in both genotypes, but in a more pronounced way in co <dig>  beside five genes presenting higher fpkm values in the resistant control kernels. similarly, genes belonging to ascorbate peroxidases families, thioredoxins and a glutathione reductase, all bearing antioxidant enzymatic activity, were also found strongly differentially expressed at basal level, suggesting differences in the enzymatic antioxidant system in the two genotypes and their ability to cope with oxidative stress. accordingly, heat shock proteins  were mainly induced in co <dig> . this is in agreement with previous results reported by campos-bermudez and co-workers  <cit> , that also found strong induction in hsps in a susceptible inbred inoculated with f. verticillioides.

differential modulation of multiple tf families
down-stream defense-responsive genes are normally regulated positively or negatively by tfs, direct or indirect targets of various signal transduction pathways. among tfs a pivotal role in biotic responses is played by wrky genes which represent one of the most represented class of tf found among degs in this study. wrky genes were induced in both genotypes in response to pathogen inoculation, but showed a stronger induction in co <dig> genotype, possibly related to an enhanced defense response. increased levels of wrky mrna, protein and dna-binding activity were previously reported following infection with viruses, bacteria or oomycetes, by fungal elicitors, sa and wounding. among these wrky22/ <dig> work downstream of mpk3/mpk <dig> in pti-related signaling induced by flg <dig>  <cit> . in our study a wrky22-like gene  resulted differentially expressed at basal level comparing the two genotypes and strongly induced by pathogen mainly in co <dig>  no induction of wrky <dig>  typically induced during gene-for-gene resistance and related to salicylic acid signaling, was observed. furthermore, wrky proteins are known to regulate subsequently activated secondary-defense response genes  <cit> . among these wrky <dig> controls phytoalexin gene expression  <cit> . as similar trends for wrky <dig> induction were observed, other wrkys more induced in co <dig> may possibly contribute here to the magnitude and promptness of diterpene phytoalexin biosynthetic genes responses.

other strongly represented tf families in degs were myb, nac and ap2/erf tfs. arabidopsis nac tfs may play a dual role in regulating both ja- and abscisic acid -dependent responses and manipulate plant stress responses by activating other genes encoding r2r3-myb tf, amylase, cold responsive protein, dehydration responsive proteins, gst, and late embryogenesis abundant  proteins  <cit> . we observed about a  <dig> -fold induction in average for all nac genes as well as for gst and mybs following f. verticillioides inoculation in co <dig> kernels. arabidopsis r2r3-myb tf directly acts on the promoters of the flavonoid biosynthesis genes and it is placed at the downstream end of the signaling cascade for flavonol-specific gene activation in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  <cit> . accordingly, we observed differential expression, both at basal level or after inoculation, of genes encoding enzymes related to biosynthesis of flavonol and phenylpropanoid, as discussed in the following paragraphs.

changes in hormone signaling-related genes
plant resistance to biotrophic/hemibiotrophic pathogens activated by gene for gene recognition is controlled largely by sa-mediated signaling pathways, while resistance to necrotrophic pathogens is mediated by the ja and et signaling pathways  <cit> . in our study we did not observe a significant induction of sa-related genes in both genotypes, in line with necrotrophic process. at the same time, the activation of typical ja-responsive defense genes such as ja-induced protein, chitinases, lipoxygenases and pr <dig> was observed with an enhanced induction for the co <dig> at  <dig> hpi, especially concerning chitinases.

beside ja, also genes involved in et signaling were strongly represented among degs. most of acc oxidase genes and et responsive proteins resulted up-regulated in both inoculated resistant and susceptible kernels, but mainly  in co <dig>  suggesting et signalling involvement in f. verticillioides-maize pathosystem, especially in the response of resistant genotype. in agreement with these observations an induction in both genotypes, but more pronounced in co <dig>  was also revealed for ap2/erf tfs, which are known to be responsive to hormones and in particular to et during biotic interactions  <cit> . interestingly, a general difference at basal level was also found for genes related to this pathway, such as the et receptor  with fpkm values of ~ <dig> and  <dig>  in co <dig> and co <dig>  respectively. the results described here substantiate the ja and et involvement in the development of resistance to f. verticillioides in maize kernels, with a limited role for specific gene for gene recognition and sa mediated resistance  <cit> .

changes in secondary metabolism-related genes
in the current study  <dig> genes were identified belonging to the secondary metabolism category, differentially regulated both between genotypes and at  <dig> hpi. selected genes encoding for enzymes involved in the most represented pathways are discussed and shown in additional file 13: table s <dig> 

five genes from the shikimate pathway were induced in the resistant genotype. in particular the genes coding 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase , 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase  and prephenate dehydratase  presented a substantially differential expression between the genotypes, while the expression of genes for shikimate kinase  and aspartate aminotransferase  were specifically induced after f. verticillioides inoculation in the resistant genotype. this suggests a strong constitutive difference in shikimate pathway between genotypes possibly contributing to the resistance.

in a previous study the induction of genes involved in the shikimate pathway and the accumulation of phenylalanine, tyrosine and shikimate products were also observed in maize leaves at 8 days post inoculation with u. maydis
 <cit> . more in detail both enzyme activity and transcript level of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , a crucial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic metabolites of the phenylpropanoid class, comprising hydroxycinnamic acid  derivatives, lignans and flavonoids  <cit> , were found as strongly induced in inoculated tissue at the same time-point  <cit> . here we identified five different pal transcripts differentially expressed presenting different expression trends. they were all responsive upon inoculation, but for three genes the induction was more elevated in the resistant genotype and two were highly expressed only in the co <dig> line before induction. phenylpropanoid-related genes, as cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  and 4-coumarate:coa ligase , and genes involved in lignin and lignan synthesis were also consistently modulated upon inoculation and at higher extent in the resistant genotype. furthermore, a significant higher basal expression of the caffeoyl-o-methyltransferase  <dig>  was observed in co <dig>  suggesting that a constitutive reinforcement of cell walls by lignin and/or other phenolic compounds could contribute to the lower susceptibility  <cit> . in agreement with our results, previous findings showed that high level of phenylpropanoids in maize kernel pericarp is a trait associated to less disease severity and fumonisin accumulation caused by f. verticillioides
 <cit> .

rna-seq data also revealed significant changes in genes belonging to the flavonoid pathway upon inoculation, especially in co <dig>  flavonoid biosynthesis starts with the amino acid phenylalanine and the end products include anthocyanins, flavones/isoflavones and condensed tannins. more in detail, a previous study investigated silk and kernel resistance to f. verticillioides and f. graminearum in maize lines differing for the 3-deoxyanthocyanidins and related 3-deoxyflavonoid  content  <cit> . it was observed that upon fungal inoculation the induction of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins took place in resistant lines, suggesting the role of these compounds in resistance to f. verticillioides. notably, our results indicated that there was a general induction of transcripts coding for enzymes of the anthocyanin pathway in co <dig> and co <dig> kernels, with a stronger modulation in the resistant genotype. furthermore anthocyanins accumulation was also reported in maize tissues infected with u. maydis, coinciding with the induction of leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase  gene expression  <cit> .

terpenoids  are another well-characterized family of inducible defense chemicals. maize produces diterpenoid phytoalexins, termed kauralexins, which are relevant components of maize pathogen disease response  <cit> . terpenoids are produced in plant cells via mevalonate pathway  and methylerythritol 4-phosphate  pathways. interestingly, in this study six genes encoding enzymes from the mep pathway were detected as induced by pathogen in both genotypes, although they exhibited an enhanced expression  in co <dig> compared to co <dig> genotype. more in detail, the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase , a regulatory points of the mep and mva pathways previously observed to increase during mechanical wounding and application of defense elicitors   <cit> , presented an enhanced induction in the resistant genotype after inoculation, beside a constitutive over-expression compared to the susceptible co <dig> 

of all the up-regulated genes identified in this study and related to secondary metabolism, the most highly expressed in the co <dig> inoculated kernels was the terpene synthase , also confirmed by real-time rt-pcr analyses, with a fpkm value of ~ <dig>  tps encodes a -beta-macrocarpene synthase, putatively associated with the biosynthesis of zealexin  <cit> . previous microarray analysis revealed that tps6/tps <dig> genes were highly expressed in z. mays following inoculation with several fungal pathogens including f. graminearum, and maize lines silenced in tps6/tps11displayed increased susceptibility to u. maydis infection . furthermore, the induction of ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase  gene, involved in the biosynthesis of kauralexin phytoalexin, was observed in both genotypes after fungal inoculation, but with a higher fpkm value for the co <dig>  the strong induction of genes related to diterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis potentiated in co <dig> genotype, therefore, confirms that f. verticillioides triggers phytoalexin biosynthesis throughout the infection process, and that these metabolites are central to the z. mays defense response.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq approach was employed for the first time in this study to investigate the molecular events involved in the establishment of resistance against f. verticillioides in z. mays. the work demonstrates that the global transcriptional analysis provided an exhaustive view of genes involved in pathogen recognition and signaling network, and controlling synthesis and activities of tfs, enzymes, phytohormones, phytoalexins and other secondary metabolites, which coordinately contribute to host resistance against f. verticillioides. in addition, the advantage of providing absolute quantification of expression is crucial for the interpretation of the defense response and to identify candidates genes for additional functional genomic analysis. useful alleles of maize genes can be now isolated from a wide range of inbred lines. furthermore, the development of allele-specific markers linked to candidate genes will allow to test for association with resistance to f. verticillioides ear rot and fumonisin accumulation. the markers will be added to an existing snp map generated from gbs of a segregating population developed from the cross between the resistant co <dig> and the susceptible co <dig> lines. qtls for resistance to both traits will be detected and they will form the basis for both in-depth understanding of the inheritance mechanism and marker-assisted selection  for f. verticillioides resistance in maize.
