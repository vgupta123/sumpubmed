BACKGROUND
post-translational modification  of proteins regulates many biological phenomena  <cit> . among the several kinds of ptm, phosphorylation affects enzymatic activity, conformations, interactions, degradation, and localization of proteins, among other effects  <cit> ; one of the critical roles of phosphorylation is in the control of protein signaling  <cit> . more than  <dig> protein kinases are thought to regulate protein signaling in humans  <cit> . in protein signaling, various reaction cascades transmit and amplify signals in a highly regulated manner by means of reversible site-specific protein phosphorylation  <cit> . kinases recognize the specific surrounding sequences of phosphosites when they phosphorylate their targets, and the majority of the identified kinases are thought to have their own unique target sequences, which are known as "motif sequences"  <cit> .

liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry , combined with phosphopeptide enrichment technology  <cit> , is a powerful method for identifying large numbers of phosphosites  <cit> . this technology has achieved phosphorylation analysis at the proteome level and has greatly expanded the new field of phosphoproteomics. in recent years, phosphoproteome data has rapidly increased for various organisms, including humans  <cit> , mice  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , flies  <cit> , plants  <cit> , and bacteria  <cit> , as a result of system-wide experiments to investigate the behavior of signal transduction pathways under various stimuli and environmental conditions. for example, at least one-third of all human proteins have been revealed to be phosphorylated  <cit> . the phosphoproteins and their phosphosites identified in these studies have been stored in public databases, such as phospho.elm  <cit> , phosida  <cit> , phosphositeplus  <cit> , and uniprot  <cit> .

"phosphoinformatics" approaches  have derived many useful biological interpretations from the huge and complex body of phosphoproteome data and have aided in the discovery of novel biological principles of protein signaling  <cit> . understanding of the relationship between protein kinases and the specific sequence patterns of their phosphorylation targets has increased rapidly and considerable data has accumulated as a result of recent phosphoproteome data mining studies  <cit>  or the use of predictive software such as scansite  <cit>  and netphos  <cit> . many kinases and their corresponding substrate recognition motifs have been accumulated in databases, such as the human protein reference database   <cit> , phosphositeplus  <cit> , and netphorest  <cit> .

the relationships between enzymes and their substrate motifs are useful for the discovery and reconstruction of signal transduction networks in living systems. several computational approaches, including networkin  <cit> , have been developed to predict signaling pathways based on the unique phosphorylation target motifs of kinases and other -omics datasets . however, the kinase specificity for target motifs appears to be limited, and therefore the accurate prediction of enzyme-substrate pairs based on the documented motifs of the kinase targets remains difficult. although the current lc-ms/ms-based phosphoproteome approach excels at the identification of phosphorylated components of the proteome, the identification of kinase-substrate relationships is fraught with challenges  <cit> .

on the other hand, by taking advantage of protein labeling methods, the high-throughput lc-ms/ms-based proteomics approaches have enabled us to compare different states of intracellular proteomes, and several studies have revealed the time course of phosphoproteome behaviors  <cit> . many phosphoproteins have been shown to have multiple potential phosphosites  <cit> , and the phosphosites in each protein behaved in different ways in response to different external stimuli. the time-course profile of phosphorylation states at individual phosphosites across multiple cellular states can be used to capture intracellular signal transitions, for example, where signals are propagated from a receptor on the cell membrane to downstream pathways  <cit> . recently, several enzyme-substrate prediction approaches have started to use such time-course phosphoproteome data to solve the challenge of accurately predicting signal transduction pathways  <cit> . since the phosphorylation profiles of substrates are affected by their corresponding kinases, most of whose enzymatic activities are enhanced by phosphorylation, it has been generally assumed that in many cases, a kinase and its substrate have similar phosphorylation profiles. this concept of a "projection effect" of signaling proteins seems to work well to predict direct relationships between a kinase and its substrates in signaling pathways based on quantitative phosphoproteome data. for example, j√∏rgensen and colleagues  <cit>  have reported the combination of quantitative phosphoproteome data with computational prediction of the signaling pathway utilizing networkin and netphorest, and locasale and wolf-yadlin  <cit>  have reported a new approach for the prediction of a tyrosine signaling pathway in which they used the principle of maximum entropy to represent similarities in the phosphorylation profile as a network construct and to predict specific pathways.

in this paper, we propose a phosphorylation dynamics-based network approach that roughly clusters the proteins localized within a condition-specific signaling pathway. although the maximum entropy-based approach  <cit>  predicts pair-wise connections of proteins in tyrosine signaling, our proposed approach clusters all types of phosphoproteins  in a network graph and suggests proteins that are localized within a specific pathway activated by a given experimental condition under which the dynamics of the phosphoproteome are measured. in this study, we used the time-course phosphoproteome data for the epidermal growth factor  stimulation of hela cells previously obtained using lc-ms/ms based on the stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture  approach  <cit> . this phosphoproteome dynamics data consists of the phosphorylation activities of digested phosphopeptides at five time points after the egf stimulation. using this data, we constructed a dynamics-based network by connecting pairs of phosphopeptides that exhibited similar patterns of phosphorylation dynamics. according to several analyses based on graph theory and comparisons with known signaling pathways registered in public databases, we demonstrated that the phosphopeptides corresponding to proteins that participated in a signaling pathway were clustered within the dynamics-based network. moreover, we found that the dynamics-based network for egf stimulation was more strongly correlated with the known egf receptor  signaling pathway than with other known pathways. this suggests the biological specificity of the egfr signaling pathway. although the time-course data show that many phosphorylation sites, including those that are not thought to be involved in egfr signaling, seemed to be activated by the egf stimulation, only the known egfr signaling pathway was markedly correlated with the time-course data at the pathway level. the egfr signaling pathway thus seemed to be precisely controlled to avoid activation of unrelated pathways. the phosphorylation dynamics-based network approach will therefore prove to be a useful strategy for providing an overview of and for exploring condition-specific protein signaling; although it cannot replace direct prediction methods, it can help to improve their accuracy.

RESULTS
construction of the phosphorylation dynamics-based network
the projection effect exists in protein signaling: some phosphorylation reactions are known to transfer signals from one molecule to another , and these reactions occur continuously . because most kinases are thought to gain their enzymatic activities as a result of phosphorylation, these signaling proteins and their targeted substrates should have similar time courses for their phosphorylation behaviors. in this context, we proposed using a phosphorylation dynamics-based network approach to cluster proteins localized within a signaling pathway.

in this study, we used the time-course phosphoproteome data previously reported by olsen et al.  <cit> . this data provides the relative phosphorylation activities of digested peptides at each of five time points  after the egf stimulation . we extracted  <dig>  peptides for which the relative phosphorylation activities were available at each of the five time points. using this time-course data, we constructed dynamics-based networks by connecting all pairs of phosphopeptides with similar phosphorylation activity profiles. we calculated the similarity of every possible pair of phosphorylation profiles using pearson's correlation coefficient . the dynamics-based network was then constructed to connect all phosphopeptide pairs with r values greater than a given threshold.

we constructed three dynamics-based networks, using threshold values of r >  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the dynamics-based network reconstructed with a threshold value of r >  <dig>  contained  <dig>  edges and  <dig> nodes . the network with r >  <dig>  consisted of  <dig>  edges and  <dig> nodes , and the network with r >  <dig>  consisted of  <dig>  edges and  <dig>  nodes .

egfr signaling pathways are more abundant in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus
to determine whether the phosphorylation dynamics-based network reflected the biological properties of a cell, we analyzed the network features using graph theory. first, we separated the dynamics-based network with r >  <dig>  into cytoplasmic and nucleic subnetworks . the network densities of the cytoplasmic and nucleic networks were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the higher density in the cytoplasmic subnetwork indicates that in the cytoplasm, more peptides have similar phosphorylation patterns than in the nucleus, which in turn suggests that the egf stimulation triggers more phosphorylation reactions in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus.

consistent with this observation, the overall degrees of the cytoplasmic nodes were higher than those of the nucleic nodes in the dynamics-based network with r >  <dig>  , although fewer phosphopeptides were identified in the cytoplasm than in nucleus, as described previously . we obtained similar results even if we calculated node degrees separately in subnetworks that consisted only of nucleic nodes and only of cytoplasmic nodes . these results may reflect the fact that in the larger cellular space of the cytoplasm, many long and alternative pathways can be activated to amplify and transmit signals into the nucleus, where the mandatory signals are transmitted through shorter, more highly regulated nuclear pathways to precisely control gene expression.

time course of the phosphoproteome reflects the cellular fraction
the network density for the whole dynamics-based network with r >  <dig>   was sparser than the densities of the cytoplasmic and nucleic subnetworks . as illustrated in figure 1a, this suggests that in the dynamics-based network, phosphopeptides from the same cellular fraction  are tightly connected, whereas connections are less likely between the cytoplasmic and nucleic nodes.

we analyzed the patterns of several local network motifs that appeared in the dynamics-based network, where each node was either nucleic or cytoplasmic . the triangular motif  in a biological network is the smallest clump of nodes that reveals the connection patterns of nodes in a locally dense network, and is thought to be a basic motif that reflects biologically relevant phenomena  <cit> . as figure 1e shows, there are four possible triangular motifs  in the dynamics-based network, which consist of various combinations of nucleic and cytoplasmic nodes: all nodes are cytoplasmic , two are cytoplasmic and one is nucleic , one is cytoplasmic and two are nucleic , and all nodes are nucleic . in each of the dynamics-based networks , we calculated the proportion of each of the four triangular motifs and compared it with the expected results generated by random edge rewiring . in the dynamics-based network with r >  <dig> , the proportions of t3: <dig> and t0: <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which were significantly higher than the expected negative control values of  <dig>  ¬±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ¬±  <dig> % in the random networks . conversely, the proportions of t2: <dig> and t1: <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, which were significantly lower than the corresponding control values of  <dig>  ¬±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ¬±  <dig> % . the dynamics-based networks generated with thresholds of r >  <dig>  and  <dig>  showed similar patterns . consequently, the triangular motif analysis supports the hypothesis that phosphopeptides identified in the same cellular fraction were localized  in the dynamics-based network. we also analyzed the number of binary  and square  motifs in the dynamics-based network with r >  <dig> , and observed similar patterns .

the connectivity of phosphopeptides within a given cellular fraction suggests that the phosphorylation dynamics-based network is a valid approach for the reconstruction of the entire protein-based signal pathway, because in most cases, signal transmission occurs between proteins that lie close together. we expected that the validity of our approach would depend partly on the threshold r. to test this hypothesis, we defined a phosphopeptide localization score for the dynamics-based network as the sum of the proportions t3: <dig> and t0: <dig>  and calculated the o/e value for the localization score . the resulting average o/e values with r >  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. therefore, the higher r threshold generates a dynamics-based network that more accurately reflects the actual intracellular signaling network.

the egf stimulation activates many signaling proteins
given the projection effect of protein signaling, proteins whose phosphorylation behaviors are similar to those of many other proteins are thought to be activated by upstream signals and to transmit a signal to downstream proteins. accordingly, in the dynamics-based network for the egf stimulation, phosphopeptides with many interacting partners  would have corresponding proteins that are activated by the egf stimulation. indeed, many biological function annotations  of the phosphopeptide nodes represented as hubs in the dynamics-based network with r >  <dig>  were related to signal transmission  and vice versa . these results suggest that many signaling proteins, including those unrelated to the egfr signaling, gain their enzymatic activities as a result of the egf stimulation .

here, "node degree" indicates the mean degree of phosphopeptides of the corresponding protein in the dynamics-based network with r >  <dig> . the biological process represents the result annotated by means of gene ontology, as described in the methods section.

the phosphorylation dynamics-based network reflects known signaling pathways
to evaluate whether the dynamics-based network reflects actual signaling phenomena at the pathway level, we compared the network with r >  <dig>  with known signal transduction pathways registered in public databases.

for this comparison, we used the shortest path length  to evaluate the closeness of pairs of nodes in the network and the pathways. in the dynamics-based network, each edge between two nodes denotes a similarity in the time course of the phosphorylation profiles, and in the known signaling pathways, each edge that connects an enzymatic protein and its substrate represents a phosphorylation reaction. although the edges in the known signaling pathways are directional, we treated them as nondirectional in this study because we only needed to investigate whether the phosphorylation dynamics patterns of two phosphosites were strongly correlated when their corresponding proteins were located close together in the known pathway, regardless of the reaction direction.

we initially obtained  <dig> kinase-substrate reactions in the egfr signaling pathway from netpath  <cit>  as the egfr  pathway . since the dynamics-based network in this study was constructed on a pilot scale by connecting only proteins with similar phosphorylation profiles, we did not use phosphatase-related reactions that are believed to have inversely correlated time-course profiles between the phosphatase and its substrate. in the egfr  pathway,  <dig> proteins  matched to the dynamics-based network; for these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> protein pairs had corresponding phosphopeptides that were reachable in the dynamics-based network. we compared the spls of these  <dig> protein pairs in the egfr  pathway with the spls of their corresponding phosphopeptide pairs in the dynamics-based network, and found a marked correlation between the two datasets , suggesting that the dynamics-based network for the egf stimulation accurately clustered proteins that are close to each other in the actual egfr signaling pathway.

the data size for the egfr  pathway was limited. to quantitatively measure the correlation between the dynamics-based network and the known pathways with a larger dataset, we prepared two other datasets of known signaling pathways from netpath: all , consisting of a total of  <dig> phosphorylation reactions in the database, and all - egfr , generated by eliminating all the egfr  reactions from the all  pathways. although the spls of the all  group were significantly correlated with those of the dynamics-based network , the all - egfr  had no correlation with the dynamics-based network . the average spls of the phosphopeptides in the dynamics-based networks that corresponded to protein pairs in the known datasets of egfr , all , and all - egfr  were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . moreover, those spls which corresponded to neighboring protein pairs  in the same datasets were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively . thus, two proteins that participated in the egfr signaling pathway were also shown to be close in the dynamics-based network for the egf stimulation, and those localized in the non-egfr signaling pathway were shown to be more distant. the correlation between the dynamics-based network and the all  pathway might have resulted from the indirect effect of the proteins belongs to the egfr signaling pathways in the all  group.

we further compared the dynamics-based network with two known signaling pathway networks generated from phospho.elm  <cit> : all , consisting of a total of  <dig>  kinase-substrate reactions, and kinases , generated by selecting  <dig> protein pairs in which both were annotated as protein kinases from the all  dataset. since phospho.elm covers phosphorylation reactions that were identified by means of large-scale, high-throughput measurements, and might include reactions that are not meaningful in living cells, the kinases  pathway was the more biologically relevant dataset. we confirmed that the dynamics-based network for the egf stimulation was more similar to the kinases  group than to the all  ; for example, the average spls in the dynamics-based network corresponding to neighboring protein pairs with spl =  <dig> in the respective datasets of kinases  and all  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these results suggest that the dynamics-based network constructed according to the time-course data for the egf stimulation reflects the actual intracellular egfr signaling pathways, and that our approach can be used to understand proteins localized in other condition-specific signaling pathways.

the egfr signal is precisely transmitted to its downstream components under the control of whole-proteome pathways
as discussed above, given the projection effect of protein signaling, the fact that many signaling proteins unrelated to egfr signaling appear as hubs in the dynamics-based network  indicates that these unrelated signaling proteins may be activated by the egf stimulation. many signaling proteins seem to be indiscriminately activated, and this would lead to side-effects that transmit and amplify inappropriate signals within the cell. however, we found that the dynamics-based network was correlated specifically with the egfr signaling pathway . in particular, the average spl for the phosphopeptide pairs in the dynamics-based network that corresponded to neighboring protein pairs in the egfr signaling pathway was  <dig> , whereas that in the non-egfr signaling pathway was  <dig>  . the adjacent protein pairs in the non-egfr signaling were therefore farther apart in the dynamics-based network for the egf stimulation. these results suggest that at the pathway level, the egfr signaling system is precisely activated to transmit and amplify signals along the appropriate intracellular pathway and to not transmit signals along inappropriate pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
the dynamics-based network generated using the time-course phosphoproteome data for the egf stimulation was clearly correlated with the known egfr signaling pathways. although recently developed computational methods predict direct signaling relationships between enzyme proteins and their substrates based on substrate-recognition motifs, our network construction approach is useful because it groups pairs of proteins localized within a signaling pathway based on the similarity of their phosphorylation dynamics data. the dynamics-based network, in turn, will complement the results of enzyme-substrate predictions based on the enzyme-specific target sequence motif  and will therefore increase their prediction accuracy. the new approach will also serve as a guide to explore enzyme targets even when the enzyme's motif information is unavailable. furthermore, the dynamics-based network for the egf stimulation allowed us to infer that egfr signaling is independently activated and precisely controlled at the whole-pathway level under conditions where many unrelated enzymatic proteins are activated by the egf stimulation. in the near future, when we obtain more condition-specific time-course phosphoproteome data with higher resolution, the phosphorylation dynamics-based network approach will improve both our general understanding of whole cellular signaling pathway and our understanding of conditionally activated signaling pathways; it will not replace recently developed prediction approaches for direct enzyme-substrate relationships, but will improve their accuracy.
