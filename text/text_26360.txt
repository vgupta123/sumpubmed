BACKGROUND
microsatellites, as one of the major repeat classes, are extremely common in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . they are generally thought to result from the mutation effects of replication slippage  <cit> . different from the origin of microsatellites from repetitive dna in animals  <cit> , plant microsatellites show a significant association with nonrepetitive dna  <cit> . they can be found abundantly within or near genes in plant genomes, and in particular, some types are significantly enriched within the 5' noncoding regions of plant genes  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis thaliana, this feature is mostly attributable to the fact that ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats are more frequently found in 5'-flanks than in other genomic regions, suggesting that they can potentially function as factors in regulating gene expression  <cit> .

for quite a long time, microsatellites were only considered as genetic markers in dna fingerprinting and diversity studies due to the extensive length polymorphisms. however, recent findings show that some of them act as cis-regulatory elements which can be recognized by transcription factors  <cit> . it has been well known for so-called gaga elements, comprising the dinucleotide repeat sequence n to be present in promoters regulating numerous developmental genes in animals  <cit> . similarly, the n sequences in regulatory regions of some plant genes can also be recognized by gaga-binding factors  <cit> , and more generally, the ga-rich element, a more complex  <dig> base pairs  based n repeat, has been shown to have protein-binding affinity  <cit> . another major microsatellite in plants, the trinucleotide repeat sequence n presented within 5'utr of ntp <dig> was found important in the modulation of transcription and translation efficiency  <cit> . furthermore, some unusual phenotypic variations were found to be associated with the length of 5' noncoding microsatellites. a typical example was reported by bao and his colleagues that variation in the number of ct/ga repeats in the 5'utr of the waxy gene was correlated with amylose content in rice  <cit> . although the mechanism is still unclear, the microsatellite length polymorphism is thought to affect the expression of the related genes of amylose synthesis.

regions of dna involved in gene regulation are expected to exhibit sequence conservation between related species over evolutionary time due to functional constraints. it has been recognized that comparative analyses of noncoding dna sequences in multiple species, known as phylogenetic footprinting, can help identify conserved putative regulatory elements  <cit> . successful identification of conserved noncoding sequences in comparisons among different grass genomes and cruciferous species, as well as between closely related genomic sequences from arabidopsis and brassica species has provided some good references for discovery of conserved noncoding microsatellite sequences  by phylogenetic footprinting in plants  <cit> .

if microsatellites are important for regulating gene expression, they should be conserved in the homologous promoters through gene duplication or speciation during plant evolution. to address the question of microsatellites associated with gene regulatory elements, we used inter- and intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting to analyze the dominant microsatellites in the 5' noncoding regions of arabidopsis and brassica oleracea genes for cnmss. about 10% of 5' noncoding ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats are conserved in the arabidopsis genome, and they are preferentially involved in gene regulation in plant-specific pathways.

RESULTS
distribution of microsatellites in different genomic regions
the characteristics of microsatellite occurrences were surveyed among the different genomic regions in the arabidopsis genome. it was obvious that microsatellites were found to be highly abundant in the regulatory regions, and the over-representation of ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats contributed most to the increase of microsatellites in these regions . this preference of ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeat occurrences indicated that they might have the role in regulating genes.

conservation of microsatellites in arabidopsis
regulatory sequence elements within promoter dna are often short, orientation independent and contain frequent gaps of variable size. thus, we determined the conserved noncoding microsatellite sequences as candidate regulatory elements based upon the following criteria: that there were at least 6-bp overlapping regions of the corresponding microsatellites between the aligned sequences. according to the criteria, we identified  <dig> arabidopsis-brassica orthologous cnmss and  <dig> arabidopsis paralogous cnmss , involving  <dig> ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats respectively , which accounted for  <dig> % of these types located in the 500-bp regions upstream of coding sequences in the arabidopsis genome. these cnmss do not randomly occur in different noncoding regions and they tend to be found more frequently near the initiation codon .

in order to validate the above study and to ensure that the observation of cnmss was not simply due to its over-representation in plant genomes, a similar analysis was carried out on three different random datasets, i.e. the  <dig> homologous pairs of 5' noncoding sequences in arabidopsis as dataset  <dig>  the  <dig> randomly shuffled pairs of 5' noncoding sequences as dataset  <dig> and the  <dig> random pairs of genomic dna sequences as dataset  <dig>  as well as the three corresponding datasets of arabidopsis and brassica sequence pairs with the same data size. figure  <dig> showed the frequencies of cnms n and n in dataset  <dig>  dataset  <dig> and dataset  <dig>  respectively. obviously, there was very little probability that cnmss were found in the 500-bp genomic dna sequence pair by chance. in contrast with the random pairs of noncoding sequences, the homologous noncoding sequences showed significant high in the frequency of cnms occurrences. taken together, these tests indicated that some microsatellites in regulatory regions were conserved from common ancestors during plant evolution.

evolution of conserved microsatellites in arabidopsis
to gain insight into the evolutionary relationship of arabidopsis-brassica and arabidopsis-arabidopsis cnmss, the synonymous substitution rate  was calculated for the corresponding gene pairs. for arabidopsis-brassica orthologous cnms gene pairs, the frequency distribution showed a clear peak for ks values of  <dig>  to  <dig>  , suggesting that these cnmss were conserved from a common ancestor over a  <dig> million years  period, which was consistent with the divergence time frame estimated at  <dig>  to  <dig>  myr based on mitochondrial dna data  <cit> . on the other hand, we noticed two peaks in the ks distribution of arabidopsis paralogous cnms gene pairs, and the ks values were  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively . the former group contained most of the paralogous cnmss which were originated from large scale gene duplication over  <dig> myr ago, which was consistent with the recent polyploidization event during evolution of the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the latter group were duplicated from the common ancestor over  <dig> myr ago, which probably occurred at the time of the divergence of brassicaceae family  <cit> .

the results from the evolutionary relationships of arabidopsis-brassica and arabidopsis-arabidopsis cnmss suggested that most paralogous cnmss pre-dated the divergence of the two species; hence, many paralogous cnmss in arabidopsis were likely to find their counterparts in brassica. further comparisons of paralogous and orthologous genes from arabidopsis and brassica were made for common cnmss . with the same criteria, we identified  <dig> cnmss found in arabidopsis paralogous pairs that also were coincident with cnmss from at least one orthologs in brassica . we called these conserved elements, shared among paralogous and orthologous genes, ultra-cnmss. an example of such ultra-cnmss was shown in figure 5c, and the three homologous ct repeats were highly conserved from a common ancestor over  <dig> myr.

conservation of microsatellites in plants
as expected, analysis of regulatory regions of related gene families revealed that many ultra-cnmss were conserved across a number of more distantly homologous genes in brassicaceae species and other plants. figure 6a showed that cnmss n were conserved among orthologous genes from arabidopsis, brassica, medicago and rice, as well as among more distantly paralogous genes in arabidopsis. these genes are representatives of a larger family of transmembrane receptor kinases and related non-transmembrane kinases in plant genomes. many of them arised from a common ancestor of dicots and monocots. another striking cnms was found in the regulatory regions of gata transcription factor genes from brassica, arabidopsis and rice. of  <dig> members in subfamily i in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , five of them have the same cnmss found in their regulatory regions . these cnms associated transcription factor genes that fell into two subgroups indicated they diverged before the dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants  <cit> . it was obvious that these ultra-cnmss had been passed down from a common ancestor of dicots and monocots under extreme purifying selection for more than  <dig> myr  <cit> .

annotation enrichment and depletion of cnms associated genes
we tested whether cnmss in genes were influenced by the function of the proteins they encode. there were  <dig> arabidopsis-brassica and  <dig> arabidopsis-arabidopsis cnms associated genes with known function in the arabidopsis genome. we looked for categories of biological process and molecular function defined in the gene ontology  database that were significantly enriched or depleted in these genes  <cit> . these cnms associated genes showed significant functional enrichment for transcription factor activity  and transcription  , and genes that performed the functions of the two types accounted for about 23% of all known genes. however, they were obviously depleted for dna metabolism . these findings suggested that cnmss might be specifically associated with regulation of transcription at the dna level, but not involved in dna metabolism.

cnmss as regulatory elements in plants
to further investigate the regulatory nature of these cnmss, we employed a computational method to discover cis-elements that were similar to function assigned elements based on the plantcare  <cit>  and place databases  <cit> . the identification of cis-elements showed that some binding sites were clustered in the consevered microsatellite regions, and these regulatory elements were involved in plant-specific functions in response to some environmental stimuli . the cnms n include the tctctct sequences similar to the tccc motif known as part of conserved dna module array atpcd-cma involved in light responsiveness  <cit> . another function of cnms n may be as an enhancer due to the same motif  found in a 60-nt region downstream of the transcription start site of the camv 35s rna, which can enhance gene translation in plant protoplasts  <cit> . as complementary sequences to n, n serve as regulatory element having similar functions, which contain a series of overlapped gag motifs  involved in light regulation  <cit> . in soybean, it is clear that the 18-bp gaga element sequence within the gsal promoter can be recognized by gbp encoded by a light-regulated gene  <cit> . the cnms n contain sequences similar to the tca-element  which is a binding site for salicylic acid-inducible proteins  <cit> . similarly, the cnms n contain agaa sequences having the characteristic of the core recognition sequence  for salicylic acid-responsive genes  <cit> .

although cnmss n/n and n/n are similar to known regulatory elements, most of them have no experimental verification for their functions. therefore, all cnms n/n associated genes were selected to investigate their changes in expression levels after the treatment of salicylic acid. the abundance of gene transcripts evaluated by the mpss showed these cnms n/n associated genes had distinct expression characters with salicylic acid treatment . about 70–80% of cnms n/n associated genes in arabidopsis leaves were regulated by salicylic acid, while others were undetectable with and without salicylic acid treatment. among these salicylic acid-responsive genes, only about 15–23% of them were up-regulated by salicylic acid, and most of them were inhibited after the treatment. seven cnms n/n associated genes were additionally analyzed for expression patterns after salicylic acid treatment. the rt-pcr showed that these investigated genes, excepted at2g <dig> and at5g <dig>  were obviously down-regulated by salicylic acid , which were consistent with the patterns of gene expression from the arabidopsis mpss database. according to the expression patterns by rt-pcr, we found the preliminary correlation between repeat number of ctt/gaa motif and gene in response to salicylic acid. the 4/ <dig> sequences were associated with gene down-regulation with salicylic acid stimulus, but the  <dig> and  <dig> associated genes were not obviously regulated by salicylic acid. these findings implied that regulation of cnms associated gene expression by salicylic acid might be dependent on the number of ctt/gaa repeats.

discussion
microsatellites n/n and n/n are well presented in the arabidopsis genome, and in particular, they are preferentially located within the 5' noncoding regions. in this study, we identified  <dig> conserved ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats for candidate regulatory elements by inter- and intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting. these cnmss tend to occur within these regions near the initiation codon with the preference of ct and ctt motifs, which are consistent with the characteristic of pyrimidine-rich repeat distribution in these regions  <cit> . another striking feature of cnms distribution is that they are rarely found in the peri-centromeric regions; in contrast, their related genes are always clustered in chromosome arms . the reasons for the absence of cnms on peri-centromeric regions are still unclear, but cnms associated genes occurring in clusters on chromosome arms is probably attributable to co-expression.

microsatellites generally evolve rapidly, but there are about 10% of 5' noncoding ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats which show high conservation in occurrences and appear to be ancient. in particular, the ultra-cnmss have been under purifying selection for more than  <dig> myr, and some of them for at least  <dig> myr. this conservation may be explained by function constraint so that many homologous genes have the corresponding microsatellite sequences in their regulatory regions. most microsatellites of ct/ga and ctt/gaa types seem to be originated by recent mutations under positive selection  <cit> , which lead to the significant over-representation of microsatellites in the 5' noncoding regions compared with other genomic fractions. the reasons of positive selection for some repeat occurrences are still unknown. however, at least, they may provide opportunities for rapid adaptive changes in these regulatory regions or play specific roles in gene regulation.

it is well known that intergenomic phylogenetic footprinting is an effective method for the discovery of regulatory elements in a set of orthologous noncoding regions from multiple species  <cit> . in plant genomes, intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting represents another powerful strategy to detect regulatory elements due to the facts that most plant genomes are rich in duplicated genes and large fractions of these gene pairs share transcriptional characteristics  <cit> . although detection of the full complement of cis-elements is not feasible by this approach due to potential acquisition and loss of individual regulatory elements between duplicated promoters, we can readily identify several specific regulatory elements which show high conservation in duplicated genes. using this approach, we have successfully identified  <dig> arabidopsis cnmss as candidate regulatory elements of plant-specific function. most of paralogous cnmss were originated from the recent polyploidization event before the divergence between arabidopsis and brassica  <cit> , implying that they might be conserved with their counterparts in brassica. we compared the data generated by inter- and intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting and found  <dig> cnmss highly conserved in both orthologous and paralogous sequences. the number of the identified ultra-cnmss may be underestimated for the incomplete reference genome sequences of brassica or the false orthologous relationships. these conserved microsatellites occurring among three or more homologous genes provides greater evidence that these cnms are likely to be significant in gene regulation.

functional annotation showed that cnms associated genes were obviously depleted for dna metabolism, such as dna replication, dna recombination and dna repair. it is possible that genes that are essential for survival, lack cnmss within their 5' noncoding regions because these genes do not need some specific regulatory elements. in contrast, these cnms genes are preferentially associated with regulation of transcription in plants. cnmss serve as regulatory elements and their related genes can be responsive to one or more forms of environmental stimuli . the functional biases imply that cnms associated genes  encoding proteins are involved in upstream pathways of defense responses in plants.

although gaga elements are known to be involved in the regulation of numerous developmental genes in animals  <cit> , we believe that cnmss n/n are likely to be associated with transcriptional regulation in light signaling pathways in plants  <cit> . these cnmss are often found in a number of different light-regulated genes  <cit> . although expression of most cnms n/n associated genes was not significantly changed with light/dark transitions, three ultra-cnmss related genes  were obviously induced with longer periods of darkness according to microarray gene expression data of  <dig> unique arabidopsis genes  <cit> . this was consistent with the fact that about 9% of these cnms genes were significantly down-regulated, while only 2% of them were up-regulated for light by a whole-genome expression analysis in seedling of arabidopsis  <cit> . it is possible that the expression level changes of most cnms n/n associated genes are not obvious under light since they are always in upstream of related pathways. however, cnmss n/n, at least parts of them, may be the binding sites for trans-acting regulators involved in light signaling pathways and their associated genes can be induced under darkness.

salicylic acid is well known as an important signaling molecule involved in both locally and systemically induced disease resistance responses  <cit> . many salicylic acid responsive genes have been found in plant defense pathways. the cnms n/n associated genes exhibit distinct expression characters with salicylic acid treatment, implying that they may be associated with a range of different stresses  <cit> . cnmss n/n as regulatory elements regulating gene expression are associated with the repeat number in salicylic acid signaling pathways. they may not act as isolated transcription factor binding sites to regulate gene expression. instead, they are likely to co-operate with other elements to perform complex regulatory functions in transcription. perhaps some of them may perform roles in rna interference by forming rna duplexes with complementary antisense microsatellite sequences, which lead to quite a few cnms genes whose transcripts are undetectable in arabidopsis leaves.

CONCLUSIONS
microsatellites n/n and n/n are preferentially associated the 5' noncoding regions in the arabidopsis genome. parts of them are conserved among the homologous genes and appear to be ancient. the computational prediction and gene expression analysis indicated that cnmss n/n and n/n acted as regulatory elements involved in light and salicylic acid responses. from our analysis, the presence of ct/ga and ctt/gaa repeats in regulatory regions may be particularly useful as a guide for further experiments of plant regulatory networks in response to environmental stimulus.
