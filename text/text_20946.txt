BACKGROUND
all organisms use information from their environment, which can include con- and hetero-specifics, to make decisions. the model nematode system, caenorhabditis elegans, as other nematodes, makes a developmental decision between developing into a developmentally arrested dauer larva or developing into a growing, non-dauer larval stage
 <cit> . dauer larvae are commonly found in nature, showing the importance of this life-cycle stage in surviving periods when food is not available
 <cit> . this developmental decision is environmentally dependent. dauer larvae are typically formed in environments that are not suitable for continued growth, specifically a low concentration of food and a high conspecific population density
 <cit> . conspecific population density is thought to be signalled by a mixture of ascaroside molecules that worms release into the environment
 <cit> . in this scenario for the wild-type strain, the concentration of these molecules are an accurate and honest measure of conspecific population density which can be understood by all members of the species

at least five ascaroside molecules  induce dauer larva formation with ascr# <dig> being most potent, but acting synergistically with ascr#3
 <cit> . the ascaroside ascr# <dig> is also the most highly produced ascaroside, especially under dauer larva-inducing conditions
 <cit> . c. elegans is now known to produce almost  <dig> different ascarosides and related molecules
 <cit> . this large number of molecules that interact in signalling have the potential to convey complex information beyond, for example, a simple honest signal of conspecific population density.

previous work in c. elegans has considered how signalling for dauer arrest may operate among different genotypes of the species
 <cit> . this work, which was conducted before the discovery of the role of ascaroside molecules in c. elegans biology, found that not all genotypes responded similarly to dauer larvae-inducing signals. these observations, with the discovery of the large number of ascaroside molecules, and together with general considerations of animal signalling more widely
 <cit> , raised the possibility that ascaroside signalling may evolve to vary among individuals of a species such that, for example, it is not a simple, honest species-wide signal.

to investigate this we characterised the extensive diversity of dauer larva arrest phenotypes among recently isolated c. elegans genotypes in response to synthetic ascaroside molecules, and to natural mixtures produced by worms, and characterised the relevant ascaroside production profiles of different genotypes. we find a very substantial diversity of ascaroside signalling, with different lines producing different signals, and lines differing in how they respond to the same signal. we also find that the ascaroside molecules can promote dauer larvae formation in some lines and represses it in others, thus showing that they are not universal promoters of dauer larva formation. we also find that ascaroside signals may be dishonest signals because we find situations where some lines induces others, but not themselves, to form dauer larvae. together these findings are consistent with the idea that while ascaroside signalling is publically broadcast, correct interpretation of that signal may be semi-private among ecological co-inhabitants or relatives, or may in some other way depend on some other aspect of the worms’ context.

RESULTS
 c. elegans lines differ in dauer larvae formation in response to synthetic ascarosides and food
we investigated the dauer larvae formation phenotypes of isogenic lines derived from  <dig> recently wild c. elegans isolates  when exposed to chemically synthesised ascr# <dig> or ascr# <dig> separately, or as a mixture, combined with two food concentrations, giving a total of six different environments.

there were significant differences among the c. elegans lines in how these synthetic ascaroside treatments and food concentrations affected the dauer larva formation of the lines  . thus, in the same environmental conditions, the lines’ dauer larva formation responses differed. these among-line differences across these six environments were seen both as different elevations and different slopes . by way of example, ascr# <dig> induced very little dauer larva formation in line px <dig> at either food concentration , but very high dauer formation in ju <dig> at either food concentration , whereas in ju <dig> ascr# <dig> induced high dauer formation at the low food concentration, but very low dauer formation at the high food concentration .
 <dig> 

the hitherto canonical view is that dauer larva formation is induced in low food conditions. however, we find that ascr# <dig> can reverse this effect and so induce dauer larva formation in high food conditions. thus, for the n <dig> wild-type exposed to ascr# <dig> dauer larva formation increases as food concentration increases. this effect is common , though not universal, among the other  <dig> lines too. similarly, the ascaroside mixture ascr#2 + ascr# <dig> can induce comparatively greater dauer larva formation at higher food concentrations, for example in lines my <dig>  ju <dig>  ju <dig> and ju <dig>  however, such effects are not seen with ascr# <dig> 

a heat map comparison of the six environmental conditions shows that the mixtures of ascr#2 + ascr# <dig> generate dauer larva formation phenotypes that are not simple additions of the responses to ascr# <dig> and ascr# <dig> when present individually . such ascaroside interaction effects can therefore generate phenotypic differences among c. elegans lines. if the ascaroside molecules act as a combinatorial system, then the very large number of ascaroside molecules acting in combination is a signalling system of potentially huge complexity and sophistication. for the canonical n <dig> line our results are consistent with previous reports of synergistic effects between these molecules
 <cit> , such that a greater proportion of dauer larvae developed in the ascaroside mixture compared to each ascaroside separately . however, this pattern only existed in four other lines , and thus is not a species-wide phenomenon.

 the natural pheromone mixtures of c. elegans lines differ
to investigate the dauer larva formation phenotypes that different c. elegans lines could induce, we collected the supernatant from  <dig> lines  and then tested their dauer larva induction effects among all lines.

there were significant differences among the c. elegans lines in how these natural pheromone mixtures and food concentrations affected the dauer larva formation of the lines  . among all lines the n2-derived supernatant induced the greatest dauer larva formation at both food concentrations , while the ju1410-derived supernatant had the lowest induction of dauer larvae . the lines’ dauer larva formation response to the synthetic ascarosides ascr# <dig> and ascr# <dig> did not predict their response to these natural pheromone mixtures, confirming the importance of other molecules in determining dauer larva formation responses.
 <dig>  data for line ju <dig> tested with pheromone from ju <dig> are not available.

comparing these c. elegans recently wild lines, the lines were not consistently most sensitive or least sensitive to their own supernatant; n <dig> and ju <dig> were among the most responsive to their own supernatant; lines px <dig>  ju <dig> and my <dig> were moderately responsive to their own supernatant . in another free-living nematode, pristionchus pacificus, culture supernatants have been found to preferentially affect dauer arrest in non-self strains
 <cit> , but this pattern is not seen in c. elegans.

in the presence of these natural pheromone mixtures dauer larva formation can be greatest in a low food environment, , or greatest in a high food environments  . this latter example shows that dauer larva formation in conditions of low food availability is not a canonical response. furthermore, the pheromone mixture produced by a line could induce very different dauer larva responses in other lines. for example, the px174-derived pheromone mixture induced a low-level dauer formation in itself, but almost 100% dauer larva formation in px <dig>  ju <dig> and my <dig>  if these effects also occur in nature, then this could be a strategy by which px <dig> induces other strains to form dauer larva, while it itself does not, therefore leaving any food resource for itself. analogously, the effect of ju1409-derived pheromone on itself, differs substantially from its effect on many other lines . such a signalling strategy is therefore manipulative, and possibly a dishonest signalling strategy. beyond this possibility, ascaroside molecules also have other intraspecific roles, such as in mating. there has also been speculation about inter-specific effects of ascarosides
 <cit> . therefore when observing and interpreting the effects that ascaroside molecules have on dauer larva formation, this does need to be considered with the context that these same molecules may be playing additional roles too.

we measured the concentration of ascr# <dig> and ascr# <dig> in these natural pheromone mixtures. this showed that the concentration of ascr# <dig> produced per worm in these cultures was significantly different among the lines  and that line my <dig> produced a significantly higher concentration than that of n <dig>  . the concentration of ascr# <dig> produced per worm did not differ among the lines . because ascr# <dig> and ascr# <dig> have combinatorial effects we were also interested in the ratio of these ascarosides that the lines produced. overall this ratio did not differ significantly among the lines , though that of n <dig> was significantly greater than that of my <dig>  . recently, c. elegans strains have been found to differ in the ratio of different ascaroside molecules that they produce, for example ascr# <dig>  was found to differ most among four c. elegans strains
 <cit> .

together, these results mean that among these c. elegans lines there is  genetic diversity for the sensation and/or transduction of environmental ascaroside and food signals in inducing dauer larva formation and  variation in the dauer-inducing signals that are produced. the dauer larva formation phenotype of the wild-type n <dig> is, then, just one example of many possible responses among c. elegans lines. this diversity of responses among these lines recently derived from the wild falsifies the idea that ascarosides are general, honest signals of conspecific population density that can be used by all lines. rather, different c. elegans lines appear to have unique responses to their environmental ascaroside and food conditions.

 roles of ascarosides in c. elegans ecology
the combinatorial effect of ascarosides in dauer larvae formation, as well in other life history components, including dauer larva dispersal  and male specific attraction, is well known
 <cit> . together this suggests the idea that ascarosides may be signals that are broadcast into the environment, but which can only be correctly interpreted by relatives or by ecological co-inhabitants in a specific scenario or environmental context
 <cit> .

we tested whether the genetic relatedness among the lines, measured as the average genetic distance across  <dig> randomly selected genes, was related to the lines’ dauer formation phenotypes when exposed to the synthetic ascarosides and food conditions, but found no significant relationships . while there is no such relationship with genome-wide measures of relatedness, lines’ relationships at specific loci, for example within regions previously identified as controlling dauer larvae formation sensitivity
 <cit>  may play an important key role.

in c. elegans a strategy of private signalling would allow a genotype to better exploit a patch of food resource, than if it had to share it with other genotypes. the natural history of c. elegans may promote this because as ephemeral food sources are exploited by a few dauer larvae, this may result in small, local clonal  populations
 <cit> . there is support for this idea from other systems. for example, in the beetle phaedon cochleariae components of its pheromone that is used for mate - mate contact depends on individual beetle’s food source, thus promoting mating within ecological co-inhabitants
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
for c. elegans the ascarosides and food in its environment modulates dauer larva formation, as well as dauer larval dispersal and male specific attraction. we have found a very substantial diversity of ascaroside signalling, with different lines producing different signals, and lines differing in how they respond to the same signal. we also find that ascr# <dig> promotes dauer larvae formation in some lines and represses it in others, thus showing that it is not a universal promoter of dauer larva formation. together these findings are consistent with the idea that while ascaroside signalling is publically broadcast, correct interpretation of that signal may be semi-private among ecological co-inhabitants or relatives, or may in some other way depend on some other aspect of the worms’ context. ascaroside signals may also be dishonest signals that worms produce because we find situations where some lines induces others, but not themselves, to form dauer larvae. ascaroside signalling, both broadcast and receipt, using a combinatorial system of different ascaroside molecules, is therefore a dynamic and rich source of information that affects many aspects of c. elegans ecology.
