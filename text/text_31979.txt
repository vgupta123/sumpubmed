BACKGROUND
interferons  are cytokines with major therapeutic applications based on their antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. type i ifns  are massively produced in most cell types in response to viral and other microbial infections, and play a vital role in innate resistance to a wide variety of viruses  <cit> . the ifnα <dig> locus comprises three variants, ifnα2a, ifnα2b and ifnα2c, ifnα2b being the predominant one detected in human genomic dna  <cit> . some of the many diseases treated with ifnα2b, alone or in combination, include type b  <cit>  and c hepatitis  <cit> , several cancers such as melanoma  <cit> , kaposi's sarcoma  <cit> , chronic myeloid lymphoma  <cit> , and angioblastoma  <cit> . in the particular case of hepatitis c, a disease affecting over  <dig> million individuals worldwide, the combination of ifnα and the viral inhibitor ribavirin has become the standard treatment  <cit> . the rising incidence of certain cancers and viral hepatitis  <cit> , in addition to ongoing investigations of novel therapeutic applications  <cit>  are increasing the needs for human recombinant ifnα2b.

human recombinant ifnα2b used in the clinic is synthesized in bacterial systems. when e. coli are grown in optimal conditions, a few grams  of recombinant human ifnα per litre of culture can be produced  <cit> . bacterially produced recombinant human ifnα2b is misfolded and therefore requires refolding into its native conformation. once purified and refolded, the recoveries are typically lower than 20%  <cit> . this refolding process also often results in loss of specific activity. in addition, bacterially produced recombinant human ifnα2b lacks the post-translational o-glycosylation present on the naturally synthesized protein. this non-glycosylated form of human recombinant ifnα2b has a shorter serum half-life than the glycosylated form  <cit> . the chemical conjugation of polyethylene glycol  molecules to the core peptide  has improved the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of ifnα2b by increasing the serum half-life  <cit> . however, the pegylation of ifnα2b has been reported in some cases to reduce its biological activity  <cit> . it has also been shown that the size of peg molecules and sites of attachment differentially interfere with the interaction and binding of ifnα2b to its receptor  <cit> . nevertheless, the us food and drug administration approved peg-ifnα2b in  <dig> and peg-ifnα2a in  <dig> for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus infection. another common problem associated with the use of refolded and pegylated ifnα  is the formation of neutralizing antibodies. antibody formation against peg-ifnα in hcv-infected patients has been associated with treatment failure  <cit> . in mice, the presence of contaminating partially unfolded ifn species appears to play a key role in the appearance of these antibodies  <cit> 

human and other mammalian cells are expression systems of choice for the production of secreted recombinant proteins such as antibodies, sometimes yielding up to hundreds of milligram to gram quantities of purified product per liter of culture  <cit> . however, the volumetric productivity of human cells for given proteins such as cytokines  is often lower by several orders of magnitude. originally, ifnα for therapeutic use was purified from the human lymphoblastoid namalwa cell line following induction with sendai virus. despite the production of an ifnα with high biological activity, namalwa cells were abandoned due to a limited productivity unable to satisfy an ever-growing demand. other systems have been tested for the production of ifnα2b. for example, avian eggs have been used for the production of human recombinant ifnα2b  <cit> , although the glycosylation pattern significantly differs from ifnα2b produced by human peripheral blood leucocytes. glycosylated ifnα2b can also be produced in insect cells, but glycosylation is of the potentially immunogenic high-mannose type and lacks sialylation  <cit> . these limitations suggest that mammalian cells are preferable hosts for the production of fully glycosylated ifnα2b. chinese hamster ovary  cells have been used for the production of various human recombinant interferons. glycosylated and biologically active mouse ifnα  <cit>  can be produced in cho cells. similarly, rossman et al have reported the production of  <dig> μg/ml of ifnα2b using a glutamine synthase-amplified vector in the mouse myeloma cell line ns <dig>  <cit> . this is the highest level of glycosylated recombinant human ifnα2b produced in a mammalian system reported to date. in vitro, the biological activity of ns0-produced ifnα2b is very similar to that produced by namalwa cells.

here we have successfully engineered a non-amplified ifn-producing clone derived from the hek <dig> mammalian cell line that produces hundreds of milligrams of ifnα2b per liter of serum-free media. the volumetric production of ifnα2b reproducibly exceeds  <dig> mg/l in batch culture and remains stable in the absence of selection for more than four months in culture. the purified ifnα2b is glycosylated and biologically active. together these results demonstrate that cost-effective production and purification of glycosylated ifnα2b from human cells can be achieved.

RESULTS
generation of a stable ifnα2b-expressing hek <dig> cell clone and production in fed-batch cultures
the expression plasmid pyd <dig> encoding the human ifnα2b gene codon-optimized for expression in human cells  is derived from the previously described ptt vector  <cit> . the signal peptide sequence, cysteine residues involved in intramolecular cystine formation, and the threonine of the consensus sequence for o-glycosylation of human ifnα2b are highlighted . the calculated molecular weight of the mature core protein  of ifnα2b is  <dig>  da. in order to generate ifnα2b-producing cells, hek <dig> were transfected with linearized pyd7-ifnα2b and selected in the presence of blasticidin. the d <dig> clone, which stably produces ifnα2b was isolated as described in material and methods. the production of ifnα2b with the d <dig> clone was performed in fed-batch culture. daily samples from the culture media taken over a period of  <dig> days were analysed by coomassie blue-stained gel . the gel shows that cell-derived contaminating proteins begin to accumulate significantly after day  <dig>  a decline in cell viability was also notable after day  <dig> . fed-batch cultivation was terminated and the culture medium harvested. it is noteworthy that early during production, hek293-derived ifnα2b migrates with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda greater than its predicted mass calculated from the amino acid sequence , while at around day  <dig>  a less abundant band of ~ <dig>  kda appears. in order to ascertain that this band is also ifnα2b, n-terminal sequencing was performed on both products. the sequences obtained were identical and read nh2-c-d-l-p-q-t, as expected for n-terminal sequence of human ifnα2b having a correctly processed signal peptide, therefore suggesting that heterogeneous posttranslational modifications may account for differences in electrophoretic mobilities of these two ifnα2b species.

purification of recombinant ifnα2b by cation exchange chromatography and analysis by gel filtration and sds-page
at the end of the production phase, the ifnα2b is purified as described in the methods section. the ifnα2b eluted in a single peak at ph  <dig> – <dig>  from the cation exchange column . the electrophoretic profiles of proteins contained in the harvest, the acid precipitate, the clarified harvest and eluted fractions, are shown on a coomassie blue-stained gel . the acidification step was selective in removing protein contaminants, as the concentration of ifnα2b in the clarified media was greater than 95% of that quantified in the harvest. the absence of ifnα2b in the flow through and in the wash suggests that ifnα2b strongly binds to the so3- column. according to a conservative estimate performed by densitometric analysis of the sds-page resolved purified material, the purity of ifnα2b exceeds 98% after the so3- column and the final desalting step.

following desalting in pbs, purified ifnα2b was loaded on a superdex  <dig> gel filtration column. the protein eluted as a single peak with elution volume identical to that of ovalbumin, a  <dig> kda protein, indicating that purified hek293-ifnα2b is not aggregated and suggesting that it may form dimers at neutral ph . a coomassie blue-stained gel of ifn-containing fractions shows diffuse wide bands as observed with non-purified material . these species with different electrophoretic mobilities reflect glycosylation heterogeneity, which was later confirmed by mass spectroscopy and glycosylation analysis. under reducing conditions, purified ifnα2b migrates as a major band of approximately  <dig> kda and a less abundant band of lower molecular weight. mass spectroscopy analysis indicates variations in the molecular weight between  <dig>  and  <dig>  da . under non-reducing conditions, ifnα2b migrates with an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda, a greater electrophoretic mobility typical of the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges . the absence of dimers  in non-reducing conditions indicates that the probable formation of dimers as suggested by gel filtration analysis is independent of intermolecular disulfide bridges. this non-covalent dimeric form of interferon has already been described and involves coordination of a zinc ion by two adjacent glutamic acid residues  from each of two ifn molecules  <cit> .

the d <dig> clone produces hundreds of milligrams of ifnα2b per liter of culture that are efficiently recovered
ifnα2b in the crude harvests of fed-batch cultures was quantified by elisa. the average concentration from two independent productions is  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/l, and this was increased to  <dig> ±  <dig> mg/l when glucose and glutamine feeds were added during production . ifnα2b recovered from the so3- column measured by elisa correlated well with measures obtained with a bradford assay and by absorbance at  <dig> nm using ifnα2b molar extinction coefficient. the concentrations of ifnα2b measured by elisa in the harvest and in the recovered fraction from the so3- column were used to determine the recovery. the mean concentration of ifnα2b shows that between  <dig> and 80% of the ifnα2b produced could be recovered, for two independent productions for each condition . these results were comparable in terms of volumetric productivity and recovery to some productions of non-glycosylated ifnα2b performed in e. coli and in the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris .

* ifnα2b activity has been determined by inhibition of viral replication. different viruses and hosts were used.

ifnα2b produced in hek <dig> is o-glycosylated, highly sialylated and biologically active
one of the major interests for producing ifnα2b in mammalian cells is to generate a glycosylated active protein. the apparent molecular weight of ifnα2b observed on sds-page suggests that ifnα2b produced in hek <dig> undergoes post-translational modifications. there is also a less abundant product of around  <dig>  kda on sds-page.

we next determined whether ifnα2b produced in hek <dig> is o-glycosylated  <cit>  and sialylated as previously reported for ifnα2b produced by human peripheral blood leucocytes  <cit> . we performed a sequential digestion of purified ifnα2b with neuraminidase and o-glycosidase to respectively remove sialic acid residues and o-linked saccharides. each digestion successively increases the electrophoretic mobility of purified ifnα2b to generate a deglycosylated product that migrates as fast as non-glycosylated recombinant ifnα2b produced e. coli . this suggests that ifnα2b produced in hek <dig> cells is o-glycosylated and sialylated. note here the quasi absence of the lower ~ <dig>  kda product in the lane containing the non-digested ifn. we found that the majority of this product is lost during the purification process, as most of it remains bound to the column . a minor band with lower electrophoretic mobility was still visible after glycosidases treatment, suggesting that this species might be core  <dig> type glycan.

a detailed mass analysis and glycosylation pattern of the purified ifnα2b was next performed by mass spectroscopy. electrospray ionization  mass spectrum exhibiting the glycoform profiles associated with each charge state of purified ifnα2b is shown . the masses of the principal glycoform of this protein correspond to the mature ifnα2b peptide chain plus the glycans indicated . the most intense peak at  <dig>  <dig> da appears to be composed of the mature peptide chain plus a single core type- <dig> disialylated glycan . a ms/ms analysis of the tryptic glycopeptides confirms the composition of this glycan. the sialylated  glycoforms appear to constitute 75% of the total species. this percentage is likely to be underestimated, as some of the other peaks that cannot be assigned easily may be sialylated as well. the disialylated type  <dig> glycoform represents 50% of the total peak area while the monosialylated glycoform is 10% of the total. using electron transfer dissociation, we also show that the glycan is linked to the expected threonine residue at position  <dig> .

finally, we tested the purified glycosylated ifnα2b produced in hek <dig> for in vitro biological activity in comparison to non-glycosylated form produced in e. coli. using a reporter gene assay we show that hek-produced ifnα2b is biologically active as it induces the production of a secreted alkaline phosphatase  reporter enzyme under the control of the human isg <dig> promoter . this assay shows that hek-produced ifnα2b is as active in vitro as bacterially produced ifnα2b. in addition, viral challenges using vesicular stomatitis virus  on madin-darby bovine kidney  cells or using encephalomyocarditis virus  on human a <dig> cells demonstrated very good antiviral activity of purified ifnα2b with titres ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> iu/mg for two independent batches .

ifnα2b activity has been determined by inhibition of viral replication of vesicular stomatitis virus  in madin darby bovine kidney cells  and of encephalomyocarditis virus  in the lung carcinoma cell line a- <dig>  both antiviral assays were carried out by pbl interferonsource. in each assay performed independently, e. coli ifnα2b was used as a positive control.

discussion
we describe here the generation of a hek <dig> cell clone  able to stably produce glycosylated human recombinant ifnα2b for culture periods up to  <dig> months in the absence of selection. the volumetric production per litre of serum-free culture can reach more than  <dig> mg/l, and is the highest volumetric production of ifnα2b reported for a mammalian system. we have further developed a rapid and reliable method for its efficient recovery and show that hek-derived ifnα2b is o-glycosylated, sialylated and biologically active.

gel filtration analysis of purified ifnα2b suggests that it may exist as a dimer in pbs at neutral ph. a zinc-dependent dimeric form of hifnα2b as already been observed  <cit>  and was also reported for the structurally homologous human ifnβ  <cit> . it is believed that interferon is biologically active as a monomer and the biological significance of zinc-mediated dimerization is currently unknown. the fact that our ifn is biologically active suggests that at the low concentration used in the bioactivity assays, it may exist in solution as a monomer.

to date, the production of recombinant ifnα2b and other cytokines in mammalian systems, particularly the development of clones stably expressing a cytokine of interest, has not been well exploited due to limitations in the volumetric productivity. one of the possible causes maybe that many cytokines exhibit strong anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activities on diverse cell lines  <cit> , therefore strongly selecting against clones that show high cytokine expression levels. the d <dig> clone nonetheless grew almost as well as parental cells indicating that hek <dig> cells can adapt to proliferate in the presence of high levels of ifnα2b. this adaptability of hek <dig> cells to a growth inhibitory cytokine suggests that they may be suitable for the large-scale production of other interferons and cytokines.

to our knowledge, no comparable expression system exists in order to contrast the volumetric productivity of our hek <dig> clone. however, this clone performs very well compared to other reported eukaryotic expression systems . nevertheless, a much greater volumetric production can be obtained from e. coli expression systems. although we believe that the production capacity of hek <dig> cells for ifnα2b can be improved, we doubt that such productivity can ever be achieved in mammalian cells, at least for a cytokine. it is obvious however that the difficulty in obtaining high recovery of refolded ifnα2b is still an important challenge with e. coli. in general, purifications of recombinant proteins from prokaryotes usually require extraction from inclusion bodies and complex refolding procedures, which reduce recovery yields  <cit> . protein refolding is a critical step in the processing of biotherapeutics, as incompletely refolded species lower specific activity and may trigger an immune response. antibodies to recombinant prokaryotic ifnα2b have been detected in hcv patients with acquired resistance to ifnα2b treatment  <cit> , although it is not clear whether denatured ifnα2b played a role in this case.

because the vast majority of biotherapeutics including growth factors, cytokines and antibodies are secreted proteins, mammalian systems, unlike prokaryotes, allow for production in perfusion as well as for the development of non-denaturing purification procedures. the first and foremost advantage of producing human recombinant proteins in mammalian systems is to generate proteins with the necessary posttranslational modifications required for full biological activity. n-glycosylation in particular, is often required for proper protein folding  <cit> , protein-protein interactions, stability and optimal pharmacokinetics  <cit> . although o-glycosylation is less critical for structure and function of proteins, it has been shown for example to increase the serum half-life of igfbp <dig> by  <dig>  folds over the non-glycosylated protein  <cit>  and to protect against proteolysis  <cit> . in a recent randomized study, o-glycosylated ifnα2b was shown to have an increased serum half life in comparison to non-glycosylated ifnα2b  <cit> . we show here that human recombinant ifnα2b produced in hek <dig> cells is o-glycosylated and extensively sialylated. despite heterogeneity in the glycan structures, the nature and distribution of glycan moieties are quite similar to ifnα2b naturally produced by human leukocytes  <cit> . approximately 50% of the purified protein is disialylated, while another 10% is monosialylated, in comparison to 50% and 30% respectively for leukocyte-derived ifn. as expected from its biochemical structure, we show that hek293-produced ifnα2b has a biological activity comparable to that of non-glycosylated e. coli-produced ifnα2b by means of an in vitro reporter-gene assay, indicating that ifnα2b is not inactivated by the purification process. this was also confirmed by the high specific activity ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> iu/mg using two different batches of purified ifn and two antiviral assays.

CONCLUSIONS
while additional studies are needed to determine whether hek293-produced ifnα2b can offer advantages over non-glycosylated or pegylated ifn for in vivo applications, this work demonstrates that the hek <dig> cell line is a suitable host for the high volumetric production of glycosylated human recombinant ifnα2b and potentially other cytokines.
