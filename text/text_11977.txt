BACKGROUND
vulnerability of lungs to influenza virus infection
our lungs are constantly in contact with the external environment and exposed to airborne debris, pathogens and chemicals, which can inflict damage acutely or chronically  <cit> . pathogens such as influenza virus can cause acute lung injury  through acute viral pneumonia  <cit> . ali induced by influenza may also lead to complications that severely impair pulmonary functions, and not only affect an individual’s quality of life, but can also be life-threatening if left untreated . furthermore, with the emergence of pandemic h1n1- <dig>  avian h5n <dig> and h7n <dig> influenza strains, and seasonal h1n <dig> and h3n <dig> strains, which cause varying severity of ali, there is a need for novel and timely intervention strategies for post-influenza lung repair to mitigate permanent tissue damage and its sequelae. among available options, promoting pulmonary tissue regeneration represents an effective approach against influenza-induced lung injury  <cit> .

regenerative medicine as a novel influenza management strategy
influenza infection of the lungs constitutes an important source of severe inflammatory damage to the lung architecture via respiratory burst of the innate immune response that cannot be generalized to other types of lung injury  <cit> . the injury can give rise to complications and/or chronic damage if not managed properly, particularly in susceptible groups such as the elderly and allergic individuals with diminished repair functions to cope with these infections  <cit> . being a common respiratory pathogen, influenza has therefore been extensively investigated to elucidate its infection kinetics and pathogenicity by clinical studies and animal models  <cit> . hence, with better understanding of its kinetics, novel strategies can be formulated based on the phases of the influenza infection process. the repair stage of influenza pneumonia is gaining increasing interest given that complications can be prevented if the damaged lung architecture is restored appropriately. studies on the recovery period of pulmonary influenza infection have indicated changes in proliferative and differentiation traits of lung epithelial cells  <cit> , suggesting potential regulation of these changes to facilitate the repair of damaged lungs.

micrornas as potential agents in post-influenza lung repair strategies
micrornas  are short rna nucleotides involved in post-transcriptional regulation, and are of major interest in view of their ease of manipulation and delivery into host cells due to their relatively small sizes . in addition, they regulate various disease processes as well as normal physiologic functions, including embryonic lung development . the recent success of mirna-based drug discovery  <cit>  further fuelled our interest to screen for mirnas that mediate repair of influenza-afflicted lungs. we hypothesized that mirnas play major roles in priming pulmonary tissues for repair and regeneration following influenza pneumonia, similar to how mirnas are intimately involved in embryonic lung development  <cit> .

this study aimed to investigate mirnas that are differentially regulated during the repair phases of influenza using an established murine model of influenza h1n <dig> pneumonia, drawing parallels to seasonal h1n <dig> infection that may culminate in pulmonary complications in susceptible individuals. another objective was to attain complete systems-level analysis to elucidate potential mirnas that are crucial for lung repair in vivo
 <cit> . these findings can improve our understanding of influenza-induced lung repair responses, and also identify mirna candidates for further validation as critical players in pulmonary regeneration.

RESULTS
infected murine lungs exhibit similar degrees of damage, while mirna and mrna microarray expression profiles are largely homogenous at specific time-points
the lungs on 7 days post-infection  were scored using a modified damage scoring system  <cit>  to ascertain that the mice suffered similar extents of damage, while lungs on  <dig> dpi were scored based on the area of recovery. lungs that displayed similar degrees of injury within each individual time-point at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi were subjected to mirna and mrna microarrays . pearson correlation was computed between all samples to compare the homogeneity of mirna and mrna expression within each animal group, which showed that mirna and mrna expression profiles were generally highly correlated. for subsequent analyses, only the probe-set intensity data that were relatively homogenous between replicates of the specific infected groups at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi were included. thus, consistent mirna profiles from  <dig> mice at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> mice at  <dig> dpi, together with consistent mrna profiles from  <dig> mice each at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi were analyzed .table  <dig>

cell types, degree of cell proliferation and repair in the lungs vastly differ between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi
compared to uninfected control, histopathologic analyses of infected lungs  revealed more damaged areas, and a greater number of infiltrating polymorphs at  <dig> dpi, suggesting predominant innate immune responses against the virus in the lungs. this finding is congruent with the viral ns <dig> expression, which was still detected in lungs at  <dig> dpi . most areas of the lungs exhibited widening interstitia and septae, with the presence of fibrin and red blood cells. in contrast, at  <dig> dpi, while some features of broncho-alveolar damage remained , viral expression was absent in the lungs. furthermore, the most striking change was the appearance of new epithelial cells at  <dig> dpi. also, the subjective increase in all types of infiltrating cells on  <dig> dpi is likely to account for the apparent increase in area of lung damage compared with  <dig> dpi.

immunohistochemistry  analyses with proliferating cell nuclear antigen  and surfactant protein-c  staining were also conducted to ascertain the degree of cellular proliferation, dna synthesis and repair in the lungs . minimal pcna-positive cells were present in the control mice at both days, while sp-c-positive at <dig> pneumocytes were evenly distributed across the lungs . lungs of infected mice at  <dig> dpi displayed areas without sp-c-positive cells likely attributed to virus-induced damage. increased pcna-positive cells were observed in the infected lungs. however, there was only a small percentage of pcna and sp-c double-positive cells at  <dig> dpi, which was not significant compared to control uninfected lungs . on  <dig> dpi, multiple areas deprived of sp-c-positive cells were likely attributed to pneumocytes damaged by infection and innate immune responses. relatively more pcna-positive cells as well as pcna and sp-c double-positive cells were observed in the lungs at  <dig> dpi, indicating enhanced cell proliferation, dna synthesis and dna repair of the pneumocytes.figure  <dig> 
histopathologic and ihc analyses of murine lungs.
 the histopathologic images of infected lungs  portray considerably greater extent of epithelial thickening and infiltration into the lungs at  <dig> dpi than  <dig> dpi . at  <dig> dpi, minimal repair processes were observed other than wound healing . in comparison, at  <dig> dpi, new epithelial and connective tissue filled the alveolar spaces .  expression of viral ns <dig> at  <dig> dpi indicated presence of virus, whereas complete viral clearance was evident at  <dig> dpi.  dividing cells  and at <dig> pneumocytes  were stained by ihc to assess lung regeneration at both time-points.  higher percentages of pcna-positive proliferating cells were noted in infected lungs at  <dig> dpi and especially at  <dig> dpi.  pcna and sp-c double-positive dividing cells were significantly higher in infected murine lungs at  <dig> dpi. n =  <dig> per group per time-point. asterisks denote p <  <dig>  compared to uninfected control.



general down-regulation of mirnas and up-regulation of genes at repair phases on both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi
the mirna array data on both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi revealed a global down-regulation of mirnas . on  <dig> dpi,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated out of  <dig> mirnas analyzed. however, on  <dig> dpi,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated out of  <dig> mirnas analyzed . table  <dig> outlines some of the top significant mirnas on both days. this landscape suggests that mirnas, being gene regulatory factors via translational repression, were down-regulated to yield augmented gene expression in response to h1n <dig> infection. indeed, the mrna expression patterns were skewed towards up-regulation in the infected groups, with  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes at  <dig> dpi ; and  <dig>  up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes at  <dig> dpi . in comparison, infected mice revealed ~ <dig> times more differentially expressed  mirnas  and ~ <dig> times more de genes  on  <dig> dpi compared to  <dig> dpi. this indicates more significant alterations in expression at  <dig> dpi, presumably due to complete viral clearance. there was almost no overlap between the de mirnas and genes between the two time-points, implying that the biological processes were largely distinct due to the different conditions of the infected lungs at each time-point .figure  <dig> 
microrna and gene microarray expression on  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.  representative heatmaps of microarrays revealed that relatively fewer mirnas and genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> dpi. however, more alterations in expression occurred at  <dig> dpi, when viral clearance was complete. in infected lung samples at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, the higher numbers of down-regulated mirnas coincided with the increase in up-regulated genes.  scatter plots showed negligible overlap between the differentially expressed mirnas and genes at the two time-points, indicating that highly specific functions were operating during these two phases of influenza pneumonia. n =  <dig> per group per time-point.

real-time rt-pcr data of representative significantly de mirnas and genes indicated good consistency with the microarray expression data . thus, both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were down-regulated at  <dig> dpi; while mir- <dig> was up-regulated, mir-34b and mir- <dig> were down-regulated at  <dig> dpi. for gene expression at  <dig> dpi, genes such as angptl <dig> and plat were up-regulated, while genes such as sox <dig> and cthrc <dig> were down-regulated. at  <dig> dpi, genes such as ereg and gdf <dig> were up-regulated, while genes such as esm <dig> and fgf <dig> were down-regulated. the directional trends of changes in all the de genes were consistent with the array data, thus validating the accuracy of both mirna and gene microarrays.figure  <dig>

overall global gene networks by ingenuity pathway analysis 
table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> ipa networks of the de genes for each time-point. at  <dig> dpi, functions and pathways such as immune cell proliferation, inflammation, and innate viral responses were significantly enriched , while repair functions were relatively sparse. the number of functions and pathways was much lower at  <dig> dpi likely due to viral presence and immediate innate immune responses to combat the virus, thus masking other functions. on the other hand, following viral clearance by  <dig> dpi, innate immune responses were likely to be largely replaced by more influenza-specific adaptive responses that are more tightly controlled and regulated. thus, the pathway enrichment shifted from immune responses to largely cellular responses of repair and proliferation, such as dna damage response, cellular proliferation, dna replication and cell cycle activities .table  <dig>

note: ipa analysis based on gene function enrichment. enrichment score is a modified p-value and indicates the likelihood of the focus genes in a network being found together due to random chance. a score of  <dig> denotes that there is a 1-in- <dig> chance that the focus genes are together in a network due to random chance. therefore, scores of  <dig> or higher have at least 99% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone.



repair pathway selection and gene ontology  analyses
to focus on mirna regulatory activities in the relevant biological functions, we applied the ipa function tree to manually select genes that were annotated in repair, development and regeneration functions. thus,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were selected for further analyses for days  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. in this selection, the de genes were mainly involved in cell death, cell survival, cell cycle, cell proliferation, dna replication, and developmental functions.

the go term analyses applied after the initial manual selection revealed different processes occurring at each time-point . at  <dig> dpi, only a relatively small number of  <dig> go terms were identified to be directly involved in repair, mainly in tissue development, cell cycle, cell death, and wound healing, implying minimal repair and developmental functions during active viral clearance. in contrast,  <dig> go terms were found to be associated directly with repair and development at  <dig> dpi. many of them were predominantly involved mainly in cell cycle, cell death, tissue development and growth factors, which corroborates the repair and replacement of damaged lung tissue occurring at  <dig> dpi.figure  <dig>

targetscan reveals the close relationship between mirnas and selected repair-related genes
to evaluate the extent to which mirnas were involved with gene regulation in repair and regeneration, targetscan analyses of the de mirnas targeting the selected genes related to repair and regeneration were applied after the go analyses. thus, the de genes were further narrowed down to  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes at  <dig> dpi, targeted by the corresponding  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas. at  <dig> dpi, there were  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated repair-related genes targeted by the corresponding  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas. when the de mirna and repair-associated genes were paired by targetscan, we thus observed  <dig> mirnas at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> mirnas at  <dig> dpi highly involved in targeting repair-associated genes that were differentially regulated at both time-points. figure  <dig> shows the major targets of the altered mirnas grouped into their respective go terms. the high frequency of repair go terms targeting genes in cell cycle, differentiation, wound healing, tissue development and angiogenesis, implied that the repair and regeneration of lung tissues following influenza pneumonia were tightly modulated by mirnas.figure  <dig>

selection of candidates having high association with lung repair functions
to screen for the final list of potential candidate mirna regulators of repair and regeneration, we applied other criteria . the rationale of this additional filter is that mirnas changes are usually subtle, and therefore selecting those significantly de mirnas with the highest or lowest raw abundance in the control samples would likely culminate in a larger magnitude of change and effect in response to infection. these additional criteria narrowed the selection down to  <dig> mirnas at  <dig> dpi  which were marked to be crucial in the early repair phase. at  <dig> dpi,  <dig> mirnas  were identified to be important in the late repair phase. most of these mirnas were also found to target genes in lung developmental go terms, rendering them the most likely regulators of the transcriptome in influenza-induced pulmonary repair .figure  <dig> 
targets of the top  <dig> mirna candidates in lung repair.  selection criteria to filter physiologically important mirnas associated with lung repair for further characterization.  most of the go term targets of the top  <dig> mirnas were involved in cell cycle and gene expression. the predominant down-regulation of most of the top  <dig> mirnas likely permits enhanced expression of their respective gene targets during pulmonary repair. mir-99a was not included since it targets only a small number of mrnas.



possible functions of high-scoring mirnas involved in targeting the lung repair pathway
of the  <dig> shortlisted mirnas, their putative functions associated with lung repair were inferred through literature searches.  indicates that the de mirnas on days  <dig> and  <dig> largely differ in their functions. the mirnas at  <dig> dpi were engaged in endothelial and fibroblast proliferation , whereas mirnas at  <dig> dpi were more broadly involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor suppression and dna repair, consistent with the functional annotation. the full list of targets of these shortlisted mirnas is provided in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

discussion
mirnas are believed to play crucial roles during the repair of the lungs following injury. we therefore identified mirnas that are differentially regulated in a time-dependent manner during the early and later recovery phases of the lungs using a murine influenza infection model. the recovery time-points were selected based on previously documented kinetics of lung-repairing cell types initially present on day  <dig>  and that peak on day  <dig>   <cit> . our in vivo investigation unveiled potential candidate mirnas strongly associated with pulmonary repair and regeneration after acute inflammatory lung injury due to influenza pneumonia.

marked expression of repair, proliferation and differentiation genes after viral clearance at  <dig> dpi
at  <dig> dpi, we observed highly specific differential expression of mainly inflammatory and viral innate immune response-related genes in the lungs. this likely reflects the specific commitment of damaged lungs to combat viral infection rather than for repair functions. in addition, the respiratory burst of innate immune responses also causes oxidative stress and dna damage, culminating in greater genetic instability and apoptosis which hamper cellular proliferation for replacing damaged cells . however, day  <dig> corresponds to the later phase of recovery, characterized by viral clearance e.g. by lymphocytes in the lungs to execute more specific adaptive responses. the emergence of new immature epithelial cells as indicated by histologic analyses as well as increased pcna-positive cells also suggest re-epithelialization of lung tissues following viral clearance. this was evident from the patches of pcna-positive cells within areas devoid of sp-c-positive cells, which may reflect epithelial progenitor cells or lung stem cells prior to differentiating into new pneumocytes to replace the damaged ones. regeneration was also illustrated by the significantly increased double-positive cells lining the edges of these sp-c-deprived areas. therefore, more efficient repair processes would be expected at  <dig> dpi, with less oxidative stress when the respiratory burst subsided in the lungs. alveolar epithelial cells could thus be replaced more readily since repair would less likely be compromised by dna damage and mutation  <cit> .

potential regulatory roles of specific mirnas in lung repair and development
the number of de mirnas was directly proportional to the number of de genes involved in repair and development. most de mirnas directly target repair-associated genes, especially at  <dig> dpi when extensive repair occurred. the close association between mirnas and lung development has been documented . the differentially regulated mirnas were unique with almost no overlap between the two time-points, indicating that mirna expression changed transiently according to the temporal gene expression requirements in the lungs. the top  <dig> mirna candidates were identified, together with their roles and targets during the lung repair phases following influenza infection. some of these mirnas are highly involved in development, regeneration, and cancer progression due to their apparent roles in proliferation and tumor suppression. this underscores that tissue repair entails essentially tightly controlled proliferation as opposed to uncontrolled proliferation in cancer which involves similar factors  <cit> .

we therefore postulate that the increase of certain stem cell-associated mirnas  promotes the stemness of cells during influenza-induced lung repair . the let- <dig> mirnas are implicated in developmental functions and cellular proliferation, and also regulate and inhibit proliferation in a cancer context. therefore, their transiently diminished expression during repair may facilitate the proliferation of new tissues . the mir- <dig> family is often enriched in epithelial tissues, and their decreased expression is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell stemness. hence, their reduced expression may suggest enhanced plasticity of epithelial cells in repairing lungs to replace damaged areas  <cit> . lowered mir- <dig> expression may also augment endothelial development to repair the lung vasculature  <cit> . interestingly, li et al  <cit>  found that mir-200a is differentially expressed in influenza virus infection, and that mirna expression profiles vary depending on the virus strains. mir- <dig> targets proliferation-suppressing factors, and its elevated expression during repair coincides with increased proliferation in repairing lungs  <cit> . notably, increased mir- <dig> may cause detrimental effects due to their targets in the tgf-β pathway, suggesting that mir- <dig> knockdown may prevent lung complications such as fibrosis  <cit> . on the other hand, some other mirnas are possibly involved in the regulation and surveillance of repair to prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation. thus, members of the mir- <dig> family were significantly down-regulated so that expression of its main target p <dig> could be suitably elevated to counteract the higher proliferation in recovering lung tissues, which are more prone to dna damage and mutation in the presence of increased dna synthesis  <cit> . hence, mir- <dig> appears to act as a tumor suppressor, with its subdued expression facilitating proliferation, but concurrently activating the negative feedback loop of p <dig>  thus showcasing the intricate roles that mirnas play in pulmonary damage and repair  <cit> .

the functions of the physiologically important mirnas during tissue repair may reflect an intermediate state between organismal development and cancer progression. transient and controlled changes in expression of proliferation activators and inhibitors may lead to a state akin to development in contrast to cancer progression, as highlighted by the vastly different de mirna profiles between days  <dig> and  <dig> 

mirnas and their potential applications in lung tissue damage and repair
this study revealed that the regulation of mirnas was unique during different phases of repair after influenza infection. the regulatory roles of these mirnas in tissue repair can be tested for their veracity in improving lung repair and the overall outcome of influenza pneumonia. for example, due to the nature of mirna targeting, some of these mirnas  may even serve dual roles of limiting damage and accelerating repair as they possess anti-inflammatory properties besides regulating pulmonary repair activities, i.e. they may minimize damage from inflammation secondary to infection  <cit> . therefore, future studies are warranted to further characterize the potential mirna candidates in vitro and in vivo, in order to determine their detailed roles in ali and repair following influenza pneumonia.

CONCLUSIONS
we anticipate that many of the biological processes observed during influenza lung damage and repair may also be relevant to other types of viral infection and lung injury, and will therefore contribute to our basic understanding of tissue repair of damaged lungs. ultimately, this integrative systems biology approach highlights the significant roles of the mirnas in acute inflammatory lung injury and regeneration, and revealed certain mirnas that may be instrumental in the repair and reconstruction of the lung architecture post-infection.
