BACKGROUND
obligate parasites, such as plant–parasitic nematodes , are infamously known for their ability to suppress host defense mechanisms and cripple yield of many agricultural crops. such devastation is tightly orchestrated by nematode effector proteins that commandeer host–plant metabolic machinery. one of the most destructive ppns to soybean yield is the soybean cyst nematode . worldwide, approximately  <dig>  billion dollars in soybean yield is lost annually due to scn infestations  <cit> . in scn susceptible soybeans, this devastation begins when the female juvenile–stage  <dig>  nematode penetrates the host root. j <dig> effector proteins are injected into the root, dissolving plant cell walls and driving formation of a metabolically–active, multinucleated feeding site known as a syncytium  <cit> . newly–molted j <dig> males and females feed from this nutrient–rich syncytium, subsequently molt into j <dig> larvae and copulate  <cit> . after approximately  <dig> days post–copulation, a hardened sac of scn eggs known as a cyst becomes visible to the naked–eye. in the resistant reaction however, cysts are not visible since j <dig> nematodes can neither form a nutrient–rich syncytium nor copulate. thus, j <dig> nematodes starve to death.

with next–generation sequencing  now becoming a central assay in transcriptomics, entire transcriptomes can now be sequenced at unprecedented resolution. fueled by the economic impact of scn infestations, numerous studies have utilized ngs assays to sequence and quantify the soybean transcriptome  <cit> .

in this study, we extend such works by conducting transcriptomic and regulatory analyses on soybean roots  inoculated with scn. we sequence the soybean root transcriptome and contrast resistant and susceptible scn reactions at  <dig> and  <dig> days after inoculation . our findings reveal likely defense–response gene candidates and a potential regulatory “signature” that captures tfbs over–representation throughout both resistant and susceptible reactions.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and read alignment
cdna libraries from soybean roots were generated after independently inoculating roots for both  <dig> and  <dig> dai in two scn populations, nh1-rhg  and tn <dig> . a baseline control cdna library was also created from roots uninoculated with scn. rna was prepared using the illumina truseq sample preparation kit. single–end rna–sequencing  was performed on the illumina gaiix, producing a total of  <dig> million reads  <dig> bp in length. across all sequenced libraries, quality assessment subtracted between 10%—19% of reads for being either a contaminent sequence or of low quality . using the bwa aligner  <cit> , quality reads were mapped against the soybean transcriptome build version  <dig>   <cit> . reads aligning to multiple transcripts were identified and assigned to the transcript with the highest quality score. in total, 59% to 69% of quality–assessed reads mapped to the soybean transcriptome.soybean–scn pathogenesis rna–seq summary

soybean transcript abundance and profiling during scn pathogenesis
differential expression tests were performed using the r package deseq  <cit> . soybean transcripts were functionally annotated using both gene ontology   <cit>  and pfam  <cit> . both fold change and log <dig> fold change of expression profiles  were computed between experimental and uninoculated samples. to render a soybean transcript differentially expressed , the transcript had to have a log <dig> fold change greater than or equal to ± <dig>  and have atleast  <dig> mapped reads across all replicates. a total of  <dig>  soybean transcripts were identified to be de in at least one of the samples . to disseminate the plant–pathogen defense–response landscape, a subset of  <dig> de transcripts were mined and classified given their go and pfam functional annotations . interestingly, virtually all of these annotation classifications exhibited induced expression profiles exclusive to the resistant reaction. for instance, all  <dig> transcripts of β– <dig> –glucanase  were generally induced throughout the resistant but suppressed in the susceptible reaction. numerous studies reveal how a pathogenic nematode can commandeer not only β– <dig> –glucanase but other cellulases to drive formation of a nematode feeding site  <cit> . both tucker et al.  <cit>  and ibrahim et al.  <cit>  quantified this destructive commandeering capability by quantifying the soybean transcriptome using high–throughout microarrays. this latter study, though examining soybean–root knot nematode interplay, reveals cell–wall modeling, defense response, and metabolism, to be the most impacted host pathways following pathogenic nematode infection. critical genes encoding isoflavonoid and flavonoid biosynthesis such as chalcone synthase , chalcone reductase , and chalcone isomerase  also exhibited similar induced expression profiles. glutathione s-transferase  genes were also induced in the resistant reaction. gst is a class of enzymes involved in reactions leading to xenobiotic degradation  <cit> , and has been shown to be induced during an scn resistant reaction  <cit> .various genes perceived during defense response are expressed during scn inoculation

numerous genes are involved in defense–response. de transcripts were binned based on go or pfam annotated function, yielding bins of differing size, n.



transcripts of genes encoding two lipoxygenase  gene family members, arachidonate 8-lipoxygenase  and linoleate 13s-lipoxygenase ; ec:  <dig> . <dig> ) were also induced throughout both  <dig> dai and  <dig> dai resistant reactions. the role a– <dig> lox plays during a nematode reaction has yet to be elucidated, however lipoxygenases in–general are consistently induced throughout a resistant scn reaction  <cit> . this raises speculation that a– <dig> lox may be perceived during scn pathogenesis.

ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase  and protein disulfide-isomerase  were induced in the resistant reaction. both rndr and pdi are thioredoxins, a family of reductases known to play defense–response roles upon perception of a pathogen  <cit> . little is known about the role rndr plays in scn pathogenesis, however an earlier microarray study examined abaxial and adaxial soybean embryo expression profiles upon exposure to auxin  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . microarray results revealed differentially expressed levels of rndr  <dig> days after auxin inoculation  <cit> . pdi on the other hand, is a well–studied thioreductase expressed during plant defense  <cit> , especially in soybean roots undergoing a resistant scn reaction  <cit> .

pathogenesis–related  transcripts, namely pr <dig> and pr <dig>  were induced in the resistant reaction. pr genes were expressed not just during scn nematode pathogenesis  <cit>  but also throughout abiotic stress  <cit> , phytohormone signaling  <cit>  and drought  <cit> .

glyoxalase i  was also induced throughout the resistant reaction. gly i has been shown to exhibit an induced expression profile in pumpkin seeds exposed to numerous abiotic stresses  <cit> . lastly, little is known about the role phytochelatin synthetase  plays throughout scn pathogenesis, however pcs has been shown in a prior study to be induced during aphid herbivory  <cit> .

following quantification of the scn–inoculated soybean root transcriptome, our analyses support earlier works by klink et al. , kandoth et al. , and li et al. . we build–on such studies by identifying a small subset of potentially novel defense–response candidate genes as well as a biologically–sound proximal regulatory landscape that captures host–scn pathogenesis interplay.

gene ontology enrichment in resistant and susceptible reactions
to identify statistically significant gene ontology  annotations, the top  <dig> induced and  <dig> suppressed genes across for all scn samples each independently underwent go process enrichment using the agrigo server  <cit> . numerous go processes were statistically significant across resistant and susceptible reactions . go process p–values were adjusted using bonferroni false discovery rate  and all go processes with adjusted p–values less than  <dig>  were selected.abundance of enriched gene ontology annotations

enriched go annotations throughout each inoculation. per inoculation, the top– <dig> induced and top– <dig> suppressed de transcripts were identified and enriched go annotations were identified. only enrichments with a bonferroni–corrected p–value less than  <dig>  were selected. counts represent both go process and go function.



the top  <dig> most statistically significant go processes within induced genes were identified . processes such as “defense response”, “syncytium formation”, “response to other organism”, “response to oxidative stress”, and “response to stress”, were revealed to be statistically significant mainly in the resistant reaction when compared to the susceptible. processes associated with organelle modification and intracellular organization also exhibited similar reaction–specific significance. this race–exclusivity exposes the crucial role basal operations play during pathogen perception.go process enrichment of induced soybean genes

similarly, the top  <dig> most statistically significant go processes within suppressed genes were also identified . contrasting go processes in suppressed genes to that of induced genes reveals an entirely different catalog of annotations. for instance,  <dig> of the  <dig> go processes in suppressed genes are statistically significant across both resistant and susceptible reactions. this indicates that nematode effectors are generally operable in a race–independent manner and capable of effortlessly suppressing a majority of crucial basal processes.go process enrichment of suppressed soybean genes

go process enrichment from the top  <dig> suppressed transcripts. almost all go processes were suppressed in a race–independent manner. the suppressive cocktail of scn effectors are revealed in the down–regulation of processes associated with photosynthesis, metabolism and biosynthesis.



the most suppressed go processes were “photosynthesis”, “photosynthesis, light harvesting”, “photosynthesis, light reaction”, and “generation of precursor metabolites and energy”. interestingly, it has been shown in prior studies that ppns can suppress photosynthesis in tomato plants by disrupting cytokinin and gibberellin signaling  <cit> . aside from photosynthetic processes, those associated with metabolism and biosynthesis were highly suppressed across both reactions. this suggests that both resistant and susceptible scn populations share a common goal of crippling basal metabolic machinery and suppressing the host machinery responsible for photosynthesis.

derivation of over–represented tfbss
the  <dig>  most induced and  <dig>  most suppressed genes were identified for each sample and the promoter sequence  <dig> kb upstream from each genes transcription start site was retrieved and appended to a fasta file . to quantify abundance of cis–regulatory tfbss within promoter sequences, we used a collection of  <dig> plant position weight matrices  from athamap  <cit>  and jaspar  <cit> . pwms are multi–dimensional matrices frequently used to model regulatory elements, namely tfbss. each cell in a pwm represents a weight as to the likelihood a particular base at a specific index is a regulatory element. thus, mapping pwms onto promoter sequences and statistically quantifying its abundance reveals insight into the magnitude of tfbs over–representation. to efficiently execute such mapping, we had developed a multivariate statistical software named marina  <cit> . marina maps tfbs models such as pwms onto promoter sequences and infers magnitude of tfbs over–representation using  <dig> knowledge–discovery metrics. the iterative proportional fitting  algorithm  <cit>  normalizes output produced from each of the  <dig> metrics, enabling unanimous agreement across the metrics as to the magnitude of tfbs over–representation. ipf scores range from  <dig> to n whereby n is the total number of over–represented tfbss. scores in the range of  <dig> represent over–represented tfbss while scores in the range of n represent highly under–represented tfbss.

for all scn samples, marina mapped all  <dig> plant pwms onto promoter sequences of both induced and suppressed genes. in total,  <dig> tfbss were over–represented in atleast one of the four samples . to reveal which tfbss exhibited variations in their ipf scores, we computed the percent change of ipf scores across both race  <dig> and race  <dig> timepoints. the difference in race  <dig> and race  <dig> percent change was derived and partitioned into  <dig> bins: tfbss with a race  <dig> and race  <dig> ipf score percent difference of at least 50% , and tfbss with a race  <dig> and race  <dig> ipf score percent difference under 50% . thus, such computation allows for identification of which tfbss vary greatly not with respect to  <dig> dai or  <dig> dai, but with respect to race  <dig> and race  <dig> inoculations.a heatmap of marina ipf scores. across the four scn samples, over–represented tfbss were identified given promoter sequences from the  <dig>  most induced and  <dig>  most suppressed genes. in total,  <dig> tfbss were over–represented in one of the inoculations and  <dig> tfbss were over–represented across all inoculations. ipf scores range from  <dig> to n whereby  <dig> represents over–represented tfbss and n represents under–represented tfbss.  enriched tfbss within race  <dig> and race  <dig> reactions with ipf scores having percent difference of at least 50%.  enriched tfbss within race  <dig> and race  <dig> reactions with ipf scores having percent difference less than 50%.



there were  <dig> tfbss over–represented across all four samples . if a tfbs was not over–represented in a specific sample, that tfbs was assigned an score of n+ <dig> so as to serve as a proxy for being highly under–represented.

many tfbss are over/under–represented in both resistant and susceptible reactions
contrasting tfbs ipf scores across samples reveals that  <dig> of the  <dig> tfbss either increase or decrease in ipf score regardless of the reaction . for instance, the tfbs for stf <dig> exhibits a relatively modest increase in its ipf score across both reactions. interestingly, stf <dig> ipf score increases from 11th to 1st from  <dig> dai to  <dig> dai respectively in the resistant reaction. besides the role stf <dig> plays in plant development  <cit> , little is known of the role this transcription factor plays in plant defense.

ipf score for the hahb <dig> tfbs greatly increased in the resistant reaction and susceptible reaction. a prior study found hahb <dig> to contribute to jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling crosstalk  <cit> . similarly, tfbss for dof <dig> and dof <dig> exhibited relatively weak increases in ipf scores across resistant and susceptible samples. dof transcripts have not been explicitly quantified as–far as their gene expression during scn pathogenesis, however such proteins have been detected during auxin signaling  <cit> . in contrast to dof <dig> and dof <dig>  the tfbs for teil had a near–50% jump in ipf scores across both reactions. being the tobacco homolog of ethylene insensitive , teil gene products have been shown to bind directly to the promoter sequence of pr1a, a central contributor in plant defense dynamics  <cit> . interestingly, across both resistant and susceptible reactions, teil scores appear to be relatively equal to one another.

the a. thaliana myb <dig> homolog, atmyb <dig>  exhibits a mild change in ipf score across both resistant and susceptible reactions. across both reactions, atmyb <dig> ipf scores were generally under–represented at  <dig> dai but become slightly over–represented at  <dig> dai. an earlier study revealed interaction between myb <dig> and auxin response factor  <dig>   <cit> , further accentuating the role atmyb <dig> could play in host–pathogen interplay  <cit> . the oscbt tfbs exhibited pronounced ipf scores across all four treatments. in both the resistant and susceptible reaction, oscbt was highly over–represented only at  <dig> dai. it was shown that oscbt mutants conferred increased pathogen resistance upon inoculation with magnaporthe grisea, revealing that oscbt suppresses defense response  <cit> .

several tfbss are over–represented in a race–dependent manner
the remaining  <dig> tfbss were over–represented in one reaction compared to the other. such tfbss can expose novel insight into tfbss over–representation patterns respective to a specific reaction.

zap <dig>  a wrky <dig> tfbs  <cit> , appears to be highly over–represented during the resistant reaction but slightly under–represented in the susceptible reaction. being a wrky tfbs, it comes as no surprise that enrichment of this tfbs in the resistant reaction captures the need to host a significant, systematic plant defense response. similarly, pif3– <dig> and pif3– <dig> were both under–represented during the susceptible reaction however slightly over–represented in the resistant reaction. it has been shown that pif plays roles in phytochrome signaling  <cit> . due to its photomorphogenic regulatory capabilities, since photosynthetic processes are heavily suppressed within resistant and susceptible reactions , such suppression explains why pif3– <dig> and pif3– <dig> have such severely under–represented ipf scores. indeed scn pathogenesis does not only disrupt the photosynthetic machinery but also the plants ability to execute sound phytochrome signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
we used rna–seq to sequence soybean whole–root  at both  <dig> and  <dig> dai upon inoculation with a resistant  and susceptible  population. contrasting tfbss over–represented in promoter sequences of de soybean genes across  <dig> and  <dig> dai time points exposed underlying transcriptomic and cis–regulatory dynamics within the soybean root during pathogenesis. in–total, over  <dig> million reads from soybean whole–root was sequenced and differential expression analysis revealed  <dig> transcripts to be statistically and biologically significant during defense–response. several viable defense–response gene candidates joined these ranks, including glyoxalase i, arachidonate– <dig> lipoxygenase, phytochelatin synthetase, and ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase.

 <dig> tfbss were rendered over/under–represented across all resistant and susceptible samples. interestingly,  <dig> of these tfbss were either over or under–represented across both reactions. thus, our results reveal presence of a biologically–sound regulatory “signature” that identifies reaction–specific soybean regulatory patterns during both resistant and susceptible scn reactions.
