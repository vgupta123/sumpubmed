BACKGROUND
micrornas are small non-coding rnas  <cit>  that act mostly as translational repressors through binding to partially complementary sequences of target messenger rnas. recent studies indicate that in some cases micrornas might act also as positive regulators of translation and transcription  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> human micrornas are annotated in the wellcome trust sanger institute microrna database  <cit> . micrornas play a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression, consequently affecting key biological events such as embryogenesis, stem cell proliferation/differentiation and organ development  <cit> . the method of conditional knockout of the microrna-processing enzyme dicer has been used to study the action of micrornas in specific tissues and organs. this approach has confirmed that the expression of micrornas is essential for morphogenesis of several systems, including the lungs, limbs, muscle, skin and neuronal development and differentiation  <cit>  including the genesis of pancreatic islet cells  <cit> . dicer-null animals displayed gross defects in all pancreatic lineages; the most dramatic reduction was seen in the endocrine cells, especially the insulin-producing beta cells. another approach utilized to assess the role of micrornas in organs/tissues is the loss of function, i.e., silencing or knock out of a single or cluster micrornas. for instance, genetic deletion of the mir-1/mir- <dig> cluster, showed its crucial role in cardiac skeletal muscle development  <cit> . several micrornas have been described in the context of pancreatic development, pancreatic exocrine/endocrine microrna expression or islet biology/physiology. for example, knockdown of mir- <dig>  an islet microrna that negatively controls insulin secretion  <cit> , has a deleterious effect on the developing pancreas of zebra fish  <cit> . mice lacking mir- <dig>  are hyperglycemic and exhibit an increase in total pancreatic alpha-cell numbers, whereas the pancreatic beta-cell mass is decreased  <cit> . recent studies indicate that during human pancreatic development mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are specific islet micrornas expressed at high levels  <cit> . mir-124a is known to target foxa <dig> the transcription factor crucial for early pancreatic formation  <cit>  by affecting genes such as pdx <dig>  kcnj <dig>  and sur <dig>  essential for the normal development of the pancreas, glucose metabolism and insulin secretion  <cit> , while mir-15a, -15b, - <dig> and - <dig> have important roles in regulating translation of ngn <dig>  a transcription factor affecting the adoption of an endocrine fate during embryogenesis  <cit> .

research conducted over the last decade has outlined rather comprehensive "roadmap" of the major molecular events that shape mouse islet development  <cit> . development of the human endocrine pancreas has not been studied as well as that of the mouse. the previous work has described expression of endocrine hormones as well as transcription factors, and presented morphological examination of islet formation during human fetal pancreatic development  <cit> .

in this study we investigated the global expression profile of micrornas in the human fetal pancreas from age  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of gestational age  and found  <dig> micrornas expressed throughout this entire period. understanding the complex processes behind pancreatic development will require the identification of rna targets that are controlled by the extensive microrna network expressed throughout the process. to identify potential microrna gene targets, we calculated the correlations between the expression profile of these  <dig> micrornas and their corresponding mrna targets, predicted by bioinformatic tools, that were found in the genome-wide rna microarray study by sarkar et al.  <cit> . these studies will advance our understanding of pancreatic development, potentially unveiling prospective therapeutic targets to treat diabetes.

RESULTS
microrna expression profile during pancreatic development
using taqman low density arrays  from applied biosystems we have performed microrna arrays with  <dig> samples acquired at different stages of human fetal pancreatic development. specifically;  <dig> wga ,  <dig> wga ,  <dig> wga,  <dig> wga ,  <dig> wga ,  <dig> wga ,  <dig> wga . the tlda platform has been selected because it requires smaller amounts of rna ~ <dig> ng per experiment, which is about ~ <dig> times less than what is required for other microarray hybridization platforms, furthermore it delivers quantitative output. we identified  <dig> micrornas expressed throughout all studied gestational ages. interestingly several micrornas reported previously in studies of mouse pancreatic development/regeneration and islet function were also found expressed during human pancreatic development .

these micrornas have been previously described as expressed in adult or developing pancreatic tissue and/or having a functional role in islets/insulinoma cells.

for the correlation analysis we arranged the samples in  <dig> gestational periods: 10-11wga ; 13- <dig> wga  and 21- <dig> wga  and classified the micrornas in three groups according to their expression profile . groups i and ii contain  <dig> and  <dig> micrornas respectively. their statistically significant  expression change was either up-regulated  or down-regulated  at least from one gestational stage to the other. group iii comprises of  <dig> micrornas with expression relatively unchanged  . table  <dig> was prepared using relative quantification  values normalized by nucleolar rna  as endogenous control . rq is a measure of the abundance of microrna transcripts at each developmental stage. the micrornas in table  <dig> are arranged according to their descending rq starting at the stage  <dig> wga. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  are micrornas previously reported as related to pancreatic islets  <cit> . we found that only statistically significant increase of expression was for mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> showed an increasing trend, however slightly below the threshold value , which might be the result of a low sample number. additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> shows the average rqs for micrornas in group i and ii in each gestational period.

micrornas from group i and ii increase and decrease their expressions respectively throughout the entire studied period. group iii includes micrornas with relatively constant expression throughout the period studied.

a hierarchical cluster representation of micrornas clearly shows the pattern of expression of these three groups .

inverse correlation between microrna and mrna during human pancreatic development
although mechanistically, micrornas inhibit mrna translation, the expression of a given microrna has also been associated with the downregulation of its target mrna levels  <cit> . therefore, to identify potential microrna targets, we performed a statistical analysis looking for inverse correlations between the micrornas in groups i and ii  and the algorithm-predicted target genes that were found in a human pancreatic development genome-wide mrna microarray gene expression study  <cit> . predictive algorithms are a powerful tool to identify potential rna targets  <cit> . the target rnas were selected by two of the most commonly used computational microrna predictive target programs, mirbase  <cit>  and targetscan  <cit> . there is a limitation to this kind of analysis because it utilizes only the sequence correlation of 3'utr mrna domain with microrna seed sequences. this excludes naturally occurring microrna targets with recognition motifs within the gene coding sequence. this kind of microrna/mrna interaction has been recently reported as well  <cit> . computational predictions often generate long lists of target genes and these are not always concordant  <cit> . therefore, the correlations were calculated with target genes predicted by each program individually, and also by the intersection of both algorithms, as this might increase the odds of identifying the bona fide rna targets  <cit> .

high confidence correlation  analysis between micrornas and gene targets identified  <dig> and  <dig> correlations using mirbase and targetscan respectively . a total of  <dig> genes were identified as potential targets by both predictive algorithms ; micrornas from group i correlated with decreased expression of  <dig> potential targets while micornas from group ii, correlated with the increasing expression of  <dig> potential targets . for all microrna groups the number of targets predicted by targetscan was higher than by mirbase, which is in agreement with previous observations  <cit> .

data for this table was obtained setting inverse correlations with r <dig> > =  <dig>  as a cut off high confidence level.

genes involved in pancreatic development correlated with micrornas
we searched for micrornas that negatively correlated with genes from signaling pathways and transcription factors that are known to be involved in murine pancreatic development and/or regulate beta-cell development  <cit>  . out of the  <dig> candidate genes,  <dig> were identified as potential targets for micrornas. most of the correlations corresponded to micrornas from group ii. ten genes up-regulated throughout the development correlated with  <dig> decreasing micrornas from group ii. decreasing gene sox <dig>  was identified as a potential target for mir- <dig> from group i. the identification of  <dig> micrornas with decreasing expression along the pancreatic development, thus contributing to the upregulation of their potential targets, suggests a collaborative network of micrornas and mrnas during this period . most micrornas target more than one gene and conversely a given mrna could be the target of several micrornas. for example, neurod <dig>  a key transcription factor involved in the conversion of pancreatic progenitor cells into endocrine cells  <cit>  was identified as a potential target of five micrornas: mir-17-5p, mir-18a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  the decrease in the expression of these five micrornas would lead to the up-regulation of neurod <dig>  it is apparent that micrornas can target genes/transcription factors that have a role at different stages of embryogenesis, for example mir- <dig> targets genes such as gata- <dig>  involved in the formation of definitive endoderm  <cit>  and transcription factors foxa <dig> and mafb both involved in beta-cell differentiation and maturation  <cit> .

data for this table was obtained setting inverse correlations with r <dig> > =  <dig>  as a cut off high confidence level. numbers in parenthesis indicates the microrna group.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we determined the microrna expression signature during human pancreatic development, identifying a total of  <dig> micrornas expressed at least once in one of the four stages evaluated . to further our understanding of gene expression regulation in the human developing pancreas, we compared this microrna signature with the global expression of genes during the similar period of the developing pancreas. there are potential limitations to this kind of study that should be considered: 1) the study was designed under the assumption that micrornas are associated with downregulation of their targets. however, some micrornas were reported as positive regulators of transcription or translation  <cit> , 2) the correlation between micrornas and gene expression was performed with mrnas only, but there are some micrornas that regulate only protein translation; 3) all potential targets were identified by algorithms analyzing the 3'utr of the mrna, while some micrornas can also interact with targets containing the recognition sequence in the coding region; 4) the expression of micrornas and mrnas was evaluated on different set of sample tissues, using different platforms by different laboratories; 5) in this study we have analyzed the pancreas as a whole, instead of looking at the cellular subsets. therefore, it is not possible to determine if the observed changes corresponded to a specific cell population .

despite of these caveats, the correlation between the expression of hundreds of micrornas with the analysis of thousands of genes expressed during human pancreatic development suggests the intertwined collaborative network of micrornas and mrnas. it also provides broad and useful information to explore potential two-way level of gene expression control regulation in which micrornas target multiple mrnas, and, target mrnas are regulated in parallel by multiple micrornas. ultimately, the speculation regarding the roles of all these presumptive targets will be justified only if they are experimentally validated.
