BACKGROUND
varying more than ten-fold, messenger rna degradation is essential for the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . differential mrna decay rates were determined by specific cis-acting sequences within mrna. for example, the mrna sequences of yeast, many mammalians, and other eukaryotes contain au-rich elements or ares at their 3' untranslated regions   <cit> . for example, in yeast, ares stimulated the shortening of poly adenine , and two kinds of degradation pathways followed. one is 5'-to-3' exonuclease access by removal of the 5' cap structure. the other is 3'-to-5' digestion by a complex of exonucleases called exosome  <cit> . genes required for these steps have been identified in yeast and were found to be conserved among eukaryotes. although the mechanisms of ares enhanced mrna degradation are unknown, several groups provided evidence that 3'-to-5' degradation by the exosome may be the major pathway of decay for at least some mammalian mrnas, including are-containing mrna sequences  <cit> . the length of ares also affected the half-life of mrna. the nonamer uuauuuauu is a typical are, and the simple repeats, na motif, is the well-known pattern of ares. it has been shown that the number of are motifs correlated with the turnover of are-mrnas such as gm-csf  <cit> . because of this, ares are usually classified according to the number of the repeats  <cit> .

it is known that the stabilization factor, such as hud, is able to bind to ares  <cit>  and most ares seem to function as destablizing factors. the overall importance of ares in biology is that they can make certain critical gene products unstable. they include proto-oncogenes such as c-fos  <cit> , c-myb  <cit> , c-myc  <cit> , and pim- <dig>  <cit> . another class of are-associated genes are immune response genes such as interferon  <cit>  and interleukin  <cit> . growth factors, such as gro-α  <cit>  and the vascular endothelial factor  <cit>  in humans, are also known to be associated with ares.

ares consist of a great number of thymine  and a few adenines. alu repeats can be a source of poly-t regions in mrna. therefore, there is a possible link between are and alu repeats.

alu repeats are sequences of approximately  <dig> nucleotides  transcribed by rna polymerase iii. the alu region is then reverse-transcribed and inserted into a new location in the genome  <cit> . it can reach a copy number in excess of  <dig>  in the human genome  <cit> . alu repeats were thought to be inserted very early in primate evolution, approximately  <dig> million years ago . alu amplification appears to have reached a maximum rate between  <dig> and  <dig> mya, and is currently amplifying at only 1% of the maximum rate  <cit> . statistical analyses have identified key diagnostic nucleotide positions in alu sequences that define  <dig> subfamilies. j class is the oldest one, s class is intermediate, and y class is the newest. the majority of alu retrotranspositions were completed at least  <dig> mya when the alu-sx subfamily, which accounts for half of all human alu sequences, and the alu-sp and alu-sq subfamilies became unable to replicate  <cit> . alu repeats account for 6–13% of the human genome  <cit>  and were identified in 5% of  <dig>  human full-length cdna. of the 5%, 82% were found in the 3' utr, while 14% were located in the 5' utr, and very rarely in the coding region  <cit> . the common role of alu at 3' utr has not been reported, although there is one specific case that the chemical, pma, can bind to alu at 3' utr and increased mrna half-life  <cit> .

we investigated the link between alu sequence and the potential ares , and suggest that the complementary poly-adenine regions of alu is one of the sources of ares at the 3' utr of mrna. figure 1a shows that the poly-adenine regions of alu contained in the anti-sense strand on dna complemented the poly-thymine regions in the sense strand; therefore, the poly-thymine regions on dna transcribed the poly-uracil regions on mrna . we propose a mechanism on how alu has been converted to ares gradually. when adenine was inserted at a regular interval in the poly-t regions, it eventually led to the generation of potential ares. it is not clear why such a regular insertion occurs, but the phenomenon has also been found in other are-like sequences. figure 1c shows transcribed are on mrna  <cit> .

RESULTS
the results from the method are shown in figure  <dig>  in the are class i, marked as 5a pattern in table  <dig>   <dig> ares were found in all  <dig>  mrna 3' utr.  <dig> % of  <dig> ares included in the class i, were detected in alu sequences at 3' utr. when we did a simulation test for the  <dig> ares and  <dig>  alu sequences by  <dig>  times, with a 95% confidence interval  threshold, it was statistically significant . in other words,  <dig> % occurrences were out of the likelihood for random overlaps of alu and are patterns in the human genome. in the are class ii 4a pattern),  <dig> were found in all 3' utr, and  <dig> were detected in alu sequences among them . the simulation results showed the  <dig> % was less than the maximum random range of  <dig> %. therefore, class ii data also showed a significance between are patterns and alu. in class iii ,  <dig> ares were discovered from all 3' utr.  <dig> out of  <dig> ares were located in alu sequences . 16% was also statistically significant with the given sample size. in classes iv and v, 5% and  <dig> % of are were found in alu, respectively. these results were still out of the random chance distribution, although they were relatively less significant than the previous classes. in class vi, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  ares were detected in alu , and it is an insignificant hypothesis that the class vi pattern is associated with alu sequences.

discussion
the possible mechanism of how ares originated from alu is as follows: alu is a special sequence that contains a poly-adenine  region at its end. the poly-a region plays an important role in the retroposition mechanism of alu  <cit> . it is known that the products of line  transposon bind the poly-a of alu. this enables alu to retroposition  <cit> . when alu with poly-a are inserted as above, it is in the double helix form with the complementary poly-t. therefore, the poly-t regions produce poly-uracil  regions in mrna when transcribed . we hypothesized that the poly-u regions generated from the alu are the source of ares after either random or directed mutation.

with this hypothesis, we suggest a new role for alu was involved in the 3' utr. it is well known that alu affected gene expression at the 5' of genes and alternative splicing at the intron region  <cit> . however, no alu role at the 3' utr has been suggested yet. we could have applied the same test to alu at 5' utr region, but there were too few data sources  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
ares are mediating sequences that affect the stabilization or degradation of biologically important genes' mrna. however, their origin in evolution has not been clear. this report presents a hypothesis and statistical evidence that alu was one of the sources of are generation or origin. a possible mechanism of are generation from alu via retroposition and regular pattern mutation is suggested.
