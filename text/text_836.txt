BACKGROUND
the p <dig> tumour suppressor plays a major role in cancer, as evidenced by frequent tp <dig> gene mutations in human tumours  <cit>  and by the high incidence of cancer in li-fraumeni individuals carrying germline mutations in the tp <dig> gene  <cit> . there is a growing consensus that p <dig> plays an important role in ageing and limitations to lifespan   <cit>  and in papazoglu and mills   <cit> ) but this assertion has been recently challenged on evolutionary grounds  <cit> . the tp <dig> gene encodes a transcription factor with target genes that are involved in dna repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. it has been described as the 'guardian of the genome'  <cit> , blocking cell cycle progression to allow the repair of damaged dna. it has also been described as a 'gatekeeper'  <cit>  that dictates the fate of cells that have suffered stress by directing them into irreversible pathways of senescence or apoptosis  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows part of the p <dig> signalling pathway which is a simplification of the kegg pathway  <cit> . under normal homeostatic conditions the cellular levels of p <dig> protein are kept at a low level. there is basal transcription of the p <dig> gene even in unstressed cells but the protein product does not accumulate as it has a short half-life   <cit>  and is usually bound to mdm <dig>  an ubiquitin e <dig> ligase, which targets p <dig> to the proteasome for degradation  <cit> . mdm2-binding prevents the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  <cit> , a phenomenon that is dependent on the catalytic activity of mdm <dig>  <cit> . mdm <dig> also has a short half-life and is a substrate of its own e <dig> ligase activity in vitro  <cit> . the degradation of a knocked-in ring finger mutant of mdm <dig> indicates the presence of an as-yet unidentified cellular e <dig> ligase that ubiquitinates mdm <dig> in vivo  <cit> . the transcription of mdm <dig> is regulated by p <dig>  <cit>  and so under normal conditions, levels of both p <dig> and mdm <dig> are kept at low levels.

it is well known that stress induces an increase in levels of p <dig> which in turn leads to an increase in the transcription of mdm <dig>  <cit> . one pathway for stabilization of p <dig> is via the kinase atm, which is activated by dna damage and phosphorylates p <dig> close to its mdm <dig> binding site, so blocking its interaction with mdm <dig>  <cit> . in addition, atm phosphorylates mdm <dig> which not only interferes with its ability to bind to p <dig> but also enhances the degradation of mdm <dig>  <cit>  providing an additional route for p <dig> stabilization. another mechanism for the increase in p <dig> levels is the activation of arf , a nucleolar protein that senses dna damage  <cit> . it has been shown that dna damage disrupts the interaction of arf with the nucleolar protein b <dig>  releasing arf into the nucleoplasm so that it can bind to mdm <dig>  <cit> . arf binding enhances the degradation of mdm <dig>  resulting in p <dig> stabilisation  <cit> . arf also responds to aberrant growth signals which are triggered by oncogenes such as ras or myc, although the induction of genes from the ink4a/arf locus displays species-specific variations  <cit> . since an increase in p <dig> leads to an increase in mdm <dig> transcription, and mdm <dig> targets p <dig> for degradation, p <dig> levels are again inhibited, providing a negative feedback loop. negative feedback loops have been found in several systems of interacting proteins  and have attracted the attention of mathematical modellers. in particular, models have been produced to analyse the oscillations of p <dig> and mdm <dig> in previously published single-cell fluorescent reporter assays  <cit> . the single cell assays have been very informative, revealing that increasing dna damage results in an increased number of oscillations, but not an increased magnitude in the response  <cit> . the data also show that there is large intercellular variation with a fraction of cells showing no response or a slowly fluctuating signal. in the cells in which oscillations were detected, there was a wide fluctuation in the amplitude  and smaller variations in the period of the peaks   <cit> . the oscillations in these data showed a period of about  <dig>  hours with a delay of about  <dig> hours between p <dig> and mdm <dig> peaks .

all previous models to date have used a deterministic approach to analyse the oscillatory behaviour. these models have used differential equations and mathematical functions requiring a fairly large number of parameters with the generation of oscillations being very dependent on the range of parameter values chosen. geva-zatorsky et al.  <cit>  constructed six different models and found that the simplest model, which contained one intermediary and one negative feedback loop with a delay, was unable to produce multiple oscillations and that it was necessary to either introduce a positive feedback loop or a time delay term . however, these additions were not sufficient for robustness over a wide range of parameter values. the addition of a non-linear negative feedback loop, a linear positive feedback loop or a second negative feedback loop produced models that were able to demonstrate sustained oscillations over a wide range of parameters. as the models are deterministic, the outcome only depends on the initial conditions and so they cannot be used to investigate cell-cell variability. geva-zatorsky et al.  <cit>  incorporated some random noise in protein production in their models and found that the introduction of low-frequency noise resulted in variability in the amplitude of the oscillations as observed experimentally. ma et al.  <cit>  also incorporated a stochastic component for the dna damage component of their model which resulted in variability in the number of oscillations. however, for a dose of  <dig>  gy, they found that the majority of cells had only one peak and that a step input of dna damage was required to obtain sustained oscillations.

the deterministic models have been useful in showing that sustained oscillations can be produced in a system where there is at least one negative feedback loop with a delay, and a sustained signal. the signal represents damaged dna which triggers the cellular response as long as the dna damage persists  <cit> . it has also been shown that stochasticity in protein production rates and dna damage events can explain some of the variability in the data. however, in cellular systems, there will be random effects on all processes. most of the previous models ignored the fact that p <dig> has to bind to mdm <dig> for its mdm2-dependent degradation and that it is transcriptionally inactive when bound. instead, the models assumed that p <dig> degradation depended on total mdm <dig> levels regardless of whether mdm <dig> was bound to p <dig> or not. since the regulation of p <dig> is dependent on its interaction with mdm <dig>  we would expect that the oscillatory behaviour of the system would be strongly affected by the binding affinity of mdm <dig> to p <dig>  therefore any mechanistic model of the system should include the mdm2-p <dig> complex.

other disadvantages of the current models are that they cannot be easily modified or linked to other models and they are not very accessible to non-mathematicians. most importantly, the majority of previous models have not clearly demonstrated how the biological mechanisms of the system contribute to the oscillatory behaviour. the deterministic models of ma et al.  <dig>  <cit> , ramalingam et. al  <dig>  <cit>  and ciliberto et al  <dig>  <cit>  are based on molecular mechanisms but none of these are really suitable for a stochastic approach, since the gillespie algorithm assumes mass action kinetics and these models contain hill or michaelis-menten functions in their rate laws. we chose to build the simplest possible stochastic model using a mechanistic approach that would be particularly relevant to biologists .

the aims of building a stochastic mechanistic model are three-fold. first, we wanted to see if a simple model with stochastic effects would produce sustained oscillations without the need to introduce additional feedback loops or non-linear functions. second, we wanted the model to be based on the mechanisms that have been proposed by biologists and could be easily understood by the non-mathematically inclined. third, we wanted to build a model that can be easily incorporated into a larger model such as our earlier model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . in order to achieve these objectives we used the systems biology markup language   <cit> . sbml is a well-known modelling standard, allowing models to be shared in a form that other researchers can use even in a different software environment. since both atm and arf activation have been proposed as mechanisms for stabilising p <dig> after dna damage, we developed two independent models to see whether oscillations would result from either of these mechanisms. the arf model is simpler, and so we introduce this model first and show how it can be modified to produce the atm model.

there are many tools available for creating and running sbml models . we chose to use the biology of ageing e-science integration and simulation system   <cit>  to store the models, run simulations and store results. the advantage of this system is that it is user friendly, it can be freely accessed by a web browser, and allows easy sharing of models.

RESULTS
 arf model
small oscillations are not distinguishable from white noise under normal conditions
the full list of species and reactions for the arf model are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. figure  <dig> shows a diagram of the system . even under normal conditions, there is synthesis and degradation of both p <dig> and mdm <dig> so that we might expect low level oscillations of both proteins. however, since we have used a stochastic simulator, there is also a large component of white noise due to protein synthesis and degradation being modelled as random processes and this would mask any oscillatory effects . the autocorrelation function  for p <dig> was computed and plotted using the r statistical package. a periodic acf is consistent with oscillations whereas a non-periodic acf is consistent with noise. the acf confirms that most of the oscillatory behaviour in the model is due to white noise but there are some regular oscillations in the second simulation . the autocorrelation function for mdm <dig> showed similar behaviour and so the plots are not shown.

one intermediary in a negative feedback loop and sustained damage is sufficient to produce oscillatory behaviour
we started by building the model without any intermediary species so that mdm <dig> synthesis only depended on the level of unbound p <dig>  this model did not predict sustained oscillations after induction of dna damage . the addition of one intermediary, mdm2_mrna, in the negative feedback loop was sufficient for the appearance of sustained oscillations, in both p <dig> and mdm <dig>  confirming that a delay is required . mdm2_mrna represents the messenger rna molecule which is transcribed from the mdm <dig> gene and carries the coding information to the site of protein synthesis. the autocorrelation function shows that these oscillations are distinct from those generated by white noise . the model output shows that there is intercellular variability as seen in the data. in particular, although most simulations resulted in  <dig> or  <dig> peaks in a  <dig> hour period, there were occasional simulated "cells" with  <dig> or less peaks. there is also intracellular variability in the oscillation amplitude but much less variation in the oscillation period which was about  <dig>  hours. the model predictions regarding the oscillation period agrees with the experimental data  <cit>  as expected, since the parameters which affect the period are well known . the agreement of the model predictions with the data, regarding intracellular and intercellular variability, confirms that a stochastic approach is appropriate for this system.

↔ no change, ↓ decrease in period or amplitude, ↑ increase in period or amplitude

predictions when the efficiency of protein degradation is reduced
since it is known that proteasomal activity declines with age  <cit> , and in tissues such as the rodent cerebral cortex, the age-related loss of chymotryptic proteasomal activity is significant , we decided to test the effect of reduced degradation by scaling all the parameters for protein degradation by the same factor . the model predicted that decreasing protein degradation efficiency by up to 30% had little effect, but larger decreases resulted in lengthening the oscillation period. if protein degradation efficiency was less than 50%, then the levels of both mdm <dig> and p <dig> increased rapidly after dna damage and the values oscillated about a mean value of about  <dig> for p <dig> and  <dig> for mdm <dig> , although the amplitude of the peaks was similar .

effect of changing the amount of damage
to simulate the effect of varying the dose of gamma irradiation, we changed the level that the species ir was increased after the irradiation event in the model. the default value of  <dig> dgy corresponds to a dose of  <dig>  gy. we used units of dgy, rather than gy, in our model, as it is necessary to use integer numbers for stochastic simulation. the effect of increasing this to  <dig> dgy  had no effect on the oscillation period and little effect on the amplitude, however there were no cells with less than  <dig> peaks, as was the case in the default model. conversely, decreasing the value of ir after irradiation led to fewer cells with oscillations. therefore our model agrees with the experimental observation that increasing irradiation dose produces more peaks but does not affect the oscillation period. however, our model predicts a slight decrease in the amplitude of the peaks at low irradiation doses .

effect of a gradual increase in dna damage from oxidative stress
during ageing there is a gradual increase in damaged dna due to either an increase in oxidative stress and/or a decrease in anti-oxidant capacity. we used our model to see if oscillations would occur in this scenario. to simulate the effect of a gradual increase in dna damage we introduced a species called ros  into the model and changed the reaction for dna damage so that it depended on the level of ros instead of ir. we set the rate law for dna damage reaction so that it gradually increased over time. we also added an event at time  <dig> hours to increase the repair capacity to see if the oscillations would die down after dna damage is repaired. the model predicts that oscillations appear when dna damage starts to accumulate and then remain even after dna damage is repaired, although the amplitude decreases over time . the persistence of the oscillations is due to the slow turnover of arf. if we increase the degradation rate of arf, then the oscillations die out more quickly . our simulations suggest that it is not necessary to have a sudden increase in damage in order to trigger spontaneous oscillations.

effect of varying model parameters
we varied each of the model parameters to test the robustness of the model and to see which parameters affected the oscillatory behaviour. the results are summarised in table  <dig>  the model is robust to small changes in the parameter values  and even ten-fold changes in some of the parameters did not result in loss of oscillatory behaviour. the changes which did result in loss of oscillations were in the parameters that affected dna damage, either because there was not enough damage to produce oscillations, or it was removed too quickly to sustain the damage signal. an increase in the turnover rate of p <dig>  mdm <dig> or mdm2_mrna  resulted in a reduction in the oscillation period. conversely, a decrease in these parameters resulted in an increase in the oscillation period. no other parameters had any significant effect on the period. we conclude that the oscillation period is very dependent on the turnover rates of p <dig> and mdm <dig>  an increase in the turnover of p <dig> resulted in an increase in the oscillation amplitude, whereas an increase in the turnover of mdm <dig> or mdm2_mrna, or in the binding affinity of mdm <dig> to p <dig> resulted in a decrease in the amplitude. the increase in amplitude due to increased p <dig> turnover is expected, since an increase in protein synthesis enables p <dig> , to reach higher levels before the feedback kicks in to limit its abundance. an increase in the binding affinity of mdm <dig> to p <dig>  results in more p <dig> being targeted for degradation, which explains the predicted decrease in amplitude. the predicted decrease in amplitude due to an increase in the turnover of mdm2_mrna is less intuitive but can be explained as follows. an increase in the turnover of mdm2_mrna increases the responsiveness of the system, resulting in a more rapid increase in mdm2_mrna and hence mdm <dig> protein synthesis following dna damage. this increase in mdm <dig> leads to some restoration of p53/mdm <dig> binding and so p <dig> levels decrease and the oscillation amplitude is thereby lowered.

 atm model
variable oscillations after dna damage
addition of p53_mrna
the reaction for p <dig> synthesis was modified by adding in a step for transcription so that p <dig> synthesis depended on the level of p53_mrna. the addition of this step resulted in an increase in noise in p <dig> synthesis. the model now predicts sustained oscillations with considerable intercellular variability as seen in the experimental data .

effect of varying model parameters
as for the arf model we varied the parameters to see if the oscillatory behaviour was sensitive to the changes in their values. the model was fairly robust to parameter changes for a decrease or increase by one order of magnitude. similar to the arf model, a ten-fold decrease in p <dig> turnover resulted in loss of oscillations. in the same way that the rate of arf activation had little effect on the model outcome, varying the rate of atm activation had no effect on the period or amplitude of oscillations. varying the parameter for p <dig> phosphorylation, resulted in a longer period and higher levels of p <dig> and mdm <dig> when the rate was increased ten-fold, but a ten-fold decrease had little effect. the parameter for mdm <dig> phosphorylation was much more sensitive with a ten-fold increase leading to loss of oscillations and a ten-fold decrease resulting in a much lower amplitude.

discussion
we have developed two simple stochastic models of the p53/mdm <dig> circuit that reflects biological reality with the minimum of detail. we considered two different mechanisms for the dna damage response: arf activation, followed by sequestering of mdm <dig>  and atm activation followed by phosphorylation of mdm <dig> and p <dig>  the reason that we chose to model both mechanisms is to encompass scenarios in which cells do or do not express arf. for some experiments h <dig> human lung cancer cells  may be utilized, but the current experimental data comes from cells which do not express arf  <cit> .

we have started from the biology and built network models that incorporate biological mechanisms and then by using sbml have converted these into discrete stochastic models that can be simulated. both models contain one negative feedback loop and all the reactions contain rates that are based on mass action kinetics. the first model was based on the p14arf mechanism of sequestering mdm <dig> after dna damage which has the effect of stabilising p <dig> and increasing its transcriptional activity. if there is sustained dna damage, this model produces oscillations which closely match experimental data in terms of the period, amplitude, intracellular variability between peaks and intercellular variability. a common criticism of mathematical models is that they are very dependent on the choice of parameter values particularly where values are not available from experimental data but have to be estimated by model fitting. however, in this model the behaviour was robust to changes in the parameter values and it predicted that oscillations were only lost when there was insufficient or unsustained dna damage, a ten-fold decrease in p <dig> turnover or a ten-fold increase in mdm <dig> turnover. only a few of the parameters affect the period or amplitude of the oscillations, and these are mainly the parameters involved with p <dig> and mdm <dig> turnover. these are the parameters for which we have the most certain information since the half-life of both p <dig> and mdm <dig> is known to be approximately 20– <dig> minutes  <cit> .

our model suggests that oscillations appear after dna damage due to the action of p14arf binding to mdm <dig>  this interferes with p53-mdm <dig> binding and prevents p <dig> degradation, so that p <dig> levels are able to rise. this is followed by a rise in mdm <dig> and when pools of mdm <dig> are high, there is sufficient mdm <dig> to allow p <dig> binding to resume. this results in p <dig> levels decreasing, and with less p <dig>  levels of mdm <dig> also start to decline. if pools of arf are still active when levels of mdm <dig> are lowered, p <dig> is prevented from binding to mdm <dig> and the cycle begins again. the oscillations continue as long as there is sufficient p14arf to compete with p <dig> for mdm <dig> binding. therefore oscillations are only observed when there is a dna damage signal. if p <dig> turnover is too slow, then p <dig> is unable to rise to sufficient levels to allow oscillations. on the other hand if mdm <dig> turnover is too rapid, then there is always enough mdm <dig> present to bind to p14arf and p <dig>  therefore our model predicts that the appearance of oscillations is dependent on the relative amounts of p <dig>  mdm <dig> and p14arf present in the cell, and it might be instructive to look at flow cytometric measurements of these proteins. the predictions of our model are amenable to experimental confirmation through genetic manipulation of p <dig>  mdm <dig>  and p14arf levels within cells exposed to dna damage.

p <dig> is important for eliminating cells with irreparable dna damage to preclude the growth of tumours, but this mechanism would not apply to postmitotic neurons; nevertheless p <dig> oscillations may still result in neuronal loss. there is evidence to suggest that loss of p <dig> improves the outcome in models of the expanded polyglutamine disorders huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  <cit> . the accumulation of abnormal protein may induce p <dig> oscillations through generation of ros  <cit> . our simulations indicate that an age-related accumulation of ros may trigger p53/mdm <dig> oscillations at a time in life when proteasome efficiency is declining. with regard to the brain  it would therefore seem particularly important to understand how oscillations are affected by alterations in the ubiquitin/proteasome system.

the mechanism of p14arf binding to mdm <dig> has some similarities with the atm mechanism. atm phosphorylates mdm <dig> and p <dig> which disrupts their ability to form a complex. atm also enhances the degradation of mdm <dig>  wagner et al used a deterministic model to show that atm induces oscillations by increasing feedback strength and effective dampening  <cit> .

the variability in the oscillations is due the stochastic nature of the processes in the model, especially the amount of dna damage and the rate of its repair. we propose that this would account for the intercellular variability in the number of peaks. since the protein synthesis and degradation is also inherently stochastic, the relative amounts of p <dig>  mdm <dig>  and p14arf also vary with time and we hypothesise that this accounts for the intracellular variability in the oscillation amplitude.

our models show that oscillations are very robust to parameter changes when we assume that the mechanism for p <dig> stabilization is via arf. this shows that the close agreement between model predictions and experimental data is not a result of our choice of parameter values. in fact most of the parameters are based on known values and the parameters for which we were least confident had the smallest effect on the model behaviour.

we also modified the model so that the mechanism for p <dig> stabilization is phosphorylation by activated atm. we have found that a model based on this mechanism requires an additional step for p <dig> synthesis and produces very variable oscillations. the experimental data  <cit>  also shows large variations in the oscillatory behaviour and since the mcf <dig> cells which were used did not express arf, our model agrees with the data. it would be interesting to repeat the experiments carried out in uri alon's laboratory on a cell line which expresses arf to see if more regular sustained oscillations are obtained. our models may help to explain why oscillations are only observed in certain cell types.

we used stochastic simulation as this is the most natural way to introduce the cellular variability which is seen experimentally. also some of the species, such as the amount of dna damage, have low values which necessitate a stochastic approach.

in order to show that the variability in the oscillations is qualitatively different from those seen in deterministic simulations, we also performed deterministic simulations on the models . in the arf model, oscillations are still produced but interestingly, the deterministic version of the atm model predicts only one peak followed by fairly constant levels of total p <dig> and mdm <dig> but at a level higher than the initial values. the lack of oscillations may be either due to the averaging effect since there is variability in the period in this model, or due to the approximation used to derive the reaction rate equations in the deterministic simulation. we carried out  <dig> repeat simulations of the stochastic atm model and compared the mean with the deterministic simulation. we found that the plot of the mean was very similar to the deterministic output, confirming that the lack of oscillations was due to the averaging effect . therefore the stochastic model shows stochastic oscillations consistent with the data for single cell measurements, whereas the deterministic model loses the oscillations due to averaging out effects. the averaging effect is due to the inter-cell variability in the oscillatory period and although the cells are synchronised for the first peak, they are unsynchronised for all the following peaks. therefore the oscillations in the different cells cancel out. this is also observed experimentally if measurements are taken for a population of cells rather than individual cells  <cit> .

we are currently collaborating with members of newcastle school of mathematics and statistics to fit the model to experimental data using new bayesian calibration techniques. this work will also shed more light on whether the arf or atm mechanism is most likely to account for the variability in the oscillatory behaviour.

sbml is a well known modelling standard that allows models to be shared and easily modified as new data emerges. the sbml code is available . it can also be downloaded from the basis system or the biomodels database  <cit> . an additional advantage of using sbml is that the model can be easily embedded into a larger model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and linked to models of dna damage and telomere-dependent checkpoint pathways that are being developed within the centre for integrated systems biology of ageing and nutrition at newcastle university. this work is currently in progress.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed models of the p53-mdm <dig> circuit to examine the cellular mechanisms that might contribute to the variability in the pattern of sustained oscillations after dna damage. we considered that stabilisation of p <dig> can occur either through activation of p14arf or via activation of atm. the models predict more regular oscillations if arf is present and suggest the need for further experiments in arf positive cells to test these predictions. the models were encoded in sbml to ensure that they can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. our work illustrates the importance of systems biology approaches to understanding the complex role of p <dig> in both ageing and cancer.
