BACKGROUND
the diamondback moth , plutella xylostella , is a major insect pest of cruciferous vegetables and is considered an especially troublesome pest because of its ability to rapidly develop high resistance to insecticides used for its control  <cit> . to date, p. xylostella has developed resistance to several types of insecticides and has become one of the most resistant pests in the world  <cit> .

chlorantraniliprole is a new type of anthranilic diamide insecticide with a novel mode of action that activates the muscle ryanodine receptor , which controls internal calcium release in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. activation of ryr causes rapid cessation of feeding, lethargy, muscle paralysis and, finally, insect death  <cit> . because of this novel mode of action, chlorantraniliprole is very effective in controlling several orders of insects, especially lepidopteran pests. however, in recent years, p. xylostella has developed high levels of resistance to chlorantraniliprole in many countries, including china .

previous studies indicate that enhanced activity of detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase , carboxylesterase  and glutathione s-transferases   <cit>  and point mutation of the target   may be associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance in p. xylostella.

by using high-throughput rna sequencing  technology, lin et al. identified  <dig>  genes that may be involved in chlorantraniliprole resistance in three field-resistant p. xylostella strains, of which several genes were associated with calcium signaling, vascular smooth muscle contraction and cardiac muscle contraction pathways, as well as in the metabolism of xenochemicals such as insecticides  <cit> .

several studies have investigated mechanisms of chlorantraniliprole resistance in the past few years and many protein-coding genes have been proven to be involved in chlorantraniliprole resistance. however, research on regulatory mechanisms of these protein-coding genes remains very limited.

most recently, micrornas  have been associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance in p. xylostella  <cit> . mirna is a kind of endogenous small non-coding rna , which regulates the expression of target genes at the transcriptional level; it has gained significant interest and popularity over the last decade  <cit> . currently, another type of ncrna, long non-coding rna , has gained significant attention from researchers. previous studies indicate that lncrnas could show quick response to diverse stimuli or stress factors and might be involved in responses to insecticides  <cit> , so we hypothesized lncrnas may also be associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance in p. xylostella.

lncrnas are non-protein coding transcripts longer than  <dig> nucleotides. they were once considered inconsequential transcriptional noise. however, recent studies have shown that lncrnas play important regulatory roles in many biological processes, including transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional control and epigenetic processes  <cit> . according to the position and direction of transcription in relation to protein-coding genes, lncrnas can be further classified into several categories, such as sense, antisense, intronic and intergenic  <cit> . like mrnas, many identified lncrnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii, hence they are presumably capped, polyadenylated and spliced. in addition, there are also a few non-polyadenylated lncrnas transcribed by rna polymerase iii  <cit> . most lncrnas are located only in the nucleus, but some are cytoplasmic or are in both the nucleus and cytoplasm  <cit> .

currently, rna-sequencing  is a very powerful approach to identify lncrnas. in the present study, a laboratory susceptible p. xylostella strain and two chlorantraniliprole-resistant strains were used, and nine strand-specific rna-seq libraries that combine rrna removal were constructed. four types of lncrnas were obtained, and the relative expression of some were found to be significantly altered in chlorantraniliprole-resistant populations. these results lay a solid foundation for further study of the roles of lncrnas in regulation of insecticide resistance in p. xylostella.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of lncrnas in p. xylostella
high-throughput strand-specific rna-seq was performed in the three dbm strains , each with three biological replicates. a total of  <dig> , <dig>  raw reads were obtained from the nine libraries, with an average of  <dig> million reads per sample. after the low-quality reads were removed,  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads with high quality were retained . clean reads that could be mapped to the p. xylostella genome  were then used for transcript assembly and annotation. a total of  <dig>  transcripts corresponding to  <dig>  loci were initially generated. then, we filtered protein-coding transcripts according to the annotated dbm reference genome  and transcripts with a single-exon and those that were shorter than  <dig> nucleotides were removed. the remaining  <dig>  transcripts  were subsequently used for protein-coding capacity prediction by using the coding potential calculator   <cit> , coding-non-coding index   <cit> , pfam-scan   <cit>  and plek  <cit>  . finally,  <dig>  reliably expressed lncrnas corresponding to  <dig>  loci were obtained and were classified into four categories including ‘u’ , ‘i’ , ‘x’  and ‘o’  according to their genomic location and referring to the neighboring genes. specifically, the ‘u’ category contained transcripts falling in the intergenic regions between two protein-coding loci. the ‘i’ category contained transcripts falling entirely within an intron of a known protein coding gene. the ‘x’ category contained transcripts that have generic exonic overlap with a known protein coding gene on the opposite strand. the ‘o’ category contained the transcripts partial overlapping with a coding gene on the same genomic strand .fig.  <dig> the computational pipeline for identifying lncrnas in p. xylostella from rna-seq data and their classification. a the lncrna identification pipeline flowchart; b coding potential analysis using the four methods; c the classification of identified lncrnas, red rectangles or lines represent the exon or intron of protein-coding gene, respectively; blue, green, purple and light blue rectangles or lines represent the exon or intron of lncrna, respectively

previous studies in mammals have shown that the expression of lncrnas is significantly lower than those of protein-encoding genes  <cit> . to determine whether p. xylostella lncrnas have similar features, we measured the expression level  of the identified lncrnas; they generally showed a lower level of expression compared to protein-coding mrnas .fig.  <dig> characterization of p. xylostella lncrnas. a comparison of expression value  in p. xylostella lncrnas and protein coding genes; for the box-plot: midline, median; box limits, 25th percentile  and 75th percentile ; upper whisker, min ), third quartile +  <dig> × interquartile range ; lower whisker, max), first quartile −  <dig> × iqr; b size distribution of p. xylostella lncrnas; c the distribution of exon number of lncrnas




the length and exon number of the identified lncrnas were also analyzed. the size distribution of these lncrnas ranged from  <dig> nucleotides to  <dig>  nucleotides, with approximately 78% of lncrnas shorter than  <dig> nucleotides . characterization of the genomic location revealed that the exon number of these lncrnas ranged from  <dig> to 13;  <dig>   p. xylostella lncrnas had two exons,  <dig>  had three exons, and  <dig>  lncrnas had more than five exons .

analysis of differentially expressed lncrnas
to systematically identify chlorantraniliprole resistance-associated lncrnas, a differential expression analysis was performed among the three strains. in total,  <dig> lncrnas  were identified as differentially expressed between chr and chs  > 1), of which  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in the chr strain . interestingly, among these differentially expressed lncrnas, we found  <dig> lncrnas that were specifically expressed in chs and  <dig> lncrnas that were specifically expressed in chr .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas identified among chs, chr and zz. a hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and chr; b hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and zz; c detailed statistics of differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and chr; d detailed statistics of differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and zz; e category of differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and chr; f category of differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and zz




in addition,  <dig> lncrnas  were differentially expressed between zz and chs  > 1), of which  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in zz . among these differentially expressed lncrnas,  <dig> lncrnas were found to be specifically expressed in zz and one lncrna was specifically expressed in chs .

compared to chs,  <dig> lncrnas  were found to be differentially expressed in both chr and zz, of which  <dig> were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated in both resistant strains . among these lncrnas,  <dig> lncrnas were specifically expressed in both resistant strains .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas overlapped in both chr and zz. a overlapped differentially expressed lncrnas; b detailed statistics of overlapped differentially expressed lncrnas; c category of overlapped differentially expressed lncrnas




to validate the rna-seq data, three lncrnas that were differentially expressed in both chr and zz compared to chs , three lncrnas that were differentially expressed only between chs and chr , and three lncrnas that were differentially expressed only between chs and zz  were randomly selected and their relative expression levels were quantified by qrt-pcr. the expression patterns of almost all selected lncrnas showed a similar trend between the results of sequencing and qrt-pcr except for tcons_ <dig>  which was significantly up-regulated in both the chr and zz strains by qrt-pcr . however, according to the sequencing results, this lncrna was significantly up-regulated only in the chr strain. pearson correlation coefficient between rna-seq data and qrt-pcr data was  <dig> , which indicates that the rna-seq data was highly correlated with that of the qrt-pcr .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of significantly differentially expressed lncrnas among chs, chr and zz. different lowercase letters represent significant differences by t-test . a: differentially expressed lncrnas in both chr and zz compared to those in chs; b: differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and chr; c: differentially expressed lncrnas between chs and zz

functional analysis of resistance-associated lncrnas
previous studies showed that lncrnas may play a cis-regulatory role in mediating the expression of neighboring genes  <cit> . we searched for protein-coding genes  <dig> kb upstream or downstream of the differently expressed lncrnas.  <dig> protein-coding genes  were found close to  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas between chr and chs, and  <dig> protein-coding genes  were found close to  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas between zz and chs . among these neighboring protein-coding genes, only the atp-binding cassette sub-family g member  <dig>  gene overlapped with tcons_ <dig>  was previously associated with insecticide resistance  <cit>  . when gene ontology  analysis of the neighboring genes was performed, we found that most of the differently expressed lncrnas between chs and chr or between chs and zz may play a role in binding-associated functions in cis mode, because most of the neighboring genes were annotated as binding-related go terms, such as metal ion binding, atp binding, dna binding. meanwhile, neighboring genes were also enriched in transcription in the biological process category  and the nucleus, integral component of membrane, cytoplasm in cellular component  categories .

many studies have also shown that lncrnas can function as trans-regulatory elements. thus, potential targets of the differently expressed lncrnas in trans-regulatory relationships were predicted using a co-expression analysis. pearson’s correlation test  was used in this study. for differently expressed lncrnas and protein-coding genes between chs and chr, a total of  <dig> interaction relationships  were detected . similarly, for differently expressed lncrnas and protein-coding genes between chs and zz, a total of  <dig> interaction relationships  were obtained , which was approximately 3-fold of that between chs and chr. this huge difference may be caused by the obvious differences between chr and zz. the former was a laboratory resistant strain selected from chs with only chlorantraniliprole, while the later came from the field with quite different genetic background and was exposed to many different insecticides over a long time period.

interestingly,  <dig> lncrnas, tcons_ <dig> and tcons_ <dig>  were found to be co-expressed with the ryanodine receptor , cytochrome p <dig>  esterase, glutathione s-transferase , atp-binding cassette transporter , heat shock protein  and cuticle protein . go enrichment analysis based on the correlated target protein-coding genes was also performed. all correlated protein-coding genes of the differently expressed lncrnas in the two comparison groups were enriched in similar go terms, such as metal ion binding, atp binding, dna binding, zinc ion binding, serine-type endopeptidase activity and rna binding in molecular function ; transcription, regulation of transcription, dna integration, innate immune response and oxidation-reduction process in biological process ; and nucleus, cytoplasm, integral component of membrane in cellular component  .

discussion
in recent years, the vast majority of studies on lncrna have been conducted in mammals, especially in humans. studies of insect lncrnas are still in preliminary stages. with the rapid development of high-throughput techniques, a batch of lncrnas has been identified in several insect species, such as drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , apis mellifera  <cit> , apis cerana  <cit> , anopheles gambiae  <cit> , aedes aegypti  <cit> , nilaparvata lugens  <cit> , bombyx mori  <cit>  and p. xylostella  <cit> , of which only n. lugens and p. xylostella are agricultural pests.

the publication of the p. xylostella genome in  <dig>  <cit>  benefits the identification of lncrnas considerably. in a recent annotation of the dbm genome in ncbi,  <dig> transcripts were annotated as ncrnas. in addition, etebari et al.  <cit>  also identified  <dig> dbm long intergenic non-coding rnas  from rna deep-sequencing data downloaded from the ncbi sequences read archive.

in the current study, a total of  <dig>  lncrnas belonging to four types were identified from  <dig> strand-specific rna-seq libraries, of which  <dig> could be blast-searched in the ncbi database. these were annotated as dbm ncrnas and shared a similar locus, including  <dig> lincrnas,  <dig> intronic lncrnas,  <dig> sense-overlapping lncrna and  <dig> antisense lncrnas . in addition,  <dig> lncrnas partially overlapped  with the lincrnas identified by etebari et al.  <cit>  according to the transcript location supplied in their research, but because of differences in the library building method and the rna-seq data used in our research, some of the overlapped lncrnas were re-classified to other lncrna types rather than lincrna. specifically,  <dig> of these overlapped lncrnas were re-classified as antisense lncrnas, including tcons_ <dig> , tcons_ <dig> , tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig> ;  <dig> were re-classified as intronic lncrnas, such as tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig> ; and  <dig> were re-classified as sense-overlapping lncrnas, such as tcons_ <dig>  and tcons_ <dig>  . moreover, there were  <dig> overlapping lncrnas between the  <dig> lincrnas identified by etebari et al.  <cit>  and the  <dig> lncrnas annotated in the ncbi . therefore,  <dig>  novel lncrnas were identified in this research. the number of putative lncrnas detected in this study was less than that reported by etebari et al.  <cit> , mainly because all the transcripts that contained only one exon were retained in their research, but only multiple exon transcripts were used for lncrna identification in the present study.

in addition, to our knowledge, this is the first application of rrna removal and strand-specific rna sequencing to study the dbm transcriptome. this method allows non-polya transcripts to be obtained, which is an obvious advantage compared to polya enrichment sequencing  <cit> . strand information was also included in our sequencing data, which made it easy to distinguish sense transcripts from antisense transcripts. as a result, anti-sense lncrnas were identified in p. xylostella for the first time. different types of lncrnas may play their roles in different way, so a detailed classification of lncrnas would help us to further understand their various functions  <cit> .

differently expressed lncrnas among chs, chr and zz were analyzed in the present study, most associated with chlorantraniliprole or other insecticide resistance. the chr strain was established from chs by successive selection with chlorantraniliprole and has been reared under the same laboratory conditions as chs; all  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas between them are likely to be associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance. the zz strain was collected from the field and had developed middle to high levels of resistance to several commonly used insecticides besides chlorantraniliprole, such as beta-cypermethrin, abamectin, spinosad and indoxacarb . each of these insecticides has a distinctive mode of action. therefore, the  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas in the zz strain likely result from the comprehensive effects of these different insecticides as well as from other environmental factors.

when the differentially expressed lncrnas in chr and zz strains were put together,  <dig> of them overlapped. these common differentially expressed lncrnas are very likely involved in chlorantraniliprole resistance because they were differentially expressed in both laboratory-selected and field-collected resistant strains, and both of these strains were resistant to chlorantraniliprole. however, due to the complexity of insecticide resistance mechanisms in the zz strain, these  <dig> lncrnas may also reveal resistance mechanisms common to other insecticides besides chlorantraniliprole. interestingly, four of these  <dig> lncrnas were specifically expressed in the two resistant strains. we speculated that their transcription might be induced by long-term exposure to chlorantraniliprole, and these four lncrnas may play key roles in chlorantraniliprole resistance in p. xylostella. the other  <dig> lncrnas differentially expressed in the chr strain may also be involved in chlorantraniliprole resistance. though this hypothesis was not supported by data from the field resistant strain, these lncrnas should not be ignored in the further study of the mechanisms of chlorantraniliprole resistance in p. xylostella. we suspected that most of these unique differentially expressed lncrnas may play specific roles in resistance only to chlorantraniliprole. meanwhile, the lncrnas that were differentially expressed only in the zz strain are more likely to be involved in resistance to other insecticides besides chlorantraniliprole.

notably, several of their overlapping lincrnas for the differently expressed lncrnas identified in the present study have been found to be involved in insecticide resistance in p. xylostella by etebari et al.  <cit> . for example, lincrna_ <dig> overlapped with tcons_ <dig> is involved in chlorpyrifos, fipronil and bt resistance; lincrna_ <dig> overlapped with tcons_ <dig> in bt and fipronil resistance; lincrna_ <dig> overlapped with tcons_ <dig> in bt resistance; and lincrna_ <dig> overlapped with tcons_ <dig> in chlorpyrifos resistance, respectively  <cit> . our finding of the involvement of these lncrnas in chlorantraniliprole resistance increases the possibility that these lncrnas play some important roles in insecticide resistance regulation.

to further study the roles of lncrnas possibly associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance, we predicted the potential function of the differently expressed lncrnas using cis and trans methods. in the cis prediction, numerous protein-coding genes were found within  <dig> kb upstream or downstream from the concerned lncrnas, most of which may play a role in binding-associated activity. in the trans prediction, potential targets of the differently expressed lncrnas were predicted using co-expression analysis and many target protein-coding genes involved in insecticide resistance were identified, indicating that lncrnas may regulate insecticide resistance by directly affecting these target genes. for example, xm_ <dig>  annotated as cytochrome p <dig> 6b <dig>  was co-expressed with  <dig> lncrnas . previous studies showed that one lncrna could regulate multiple protein-coding genes and vice versa  <cit> . here, these  <dig> lncrnas may collectively regulate the expression of cytochrome p <dig> 6b <dig>  thus enhancing the metabolism of insecticides in p. xylostella. in fact, peng et al.  <cit>  have identified a set of lncrnas highly correlated with the expression of p <dig> in mouse liver during maturation. interestingly, the ryanodine receptor, the main target of chlorantraniliprole, was also found to be co-expressed with two lncrnas , and these lncrnas may directly control the expression of the ryanodine receptor to mediate chlorantraniliprole resistance. in addition to this, several binding terms were identified as enriched go terms for the target mrnas in both comparison groups. lncrnas play important roles in regulating biological functions through various mechanisms that are not fully understood; these proposed mechanisms include regulation based on rna-protein interactions as well as rna-rna interactions and rna-dna interactions  <cit> . here, binding terms were identified as enriched go terms for the correlated mrnas in both comparison groups, and it is very likely that lncrnas may act primarily through these interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study,  <dig>  lncrnas were identified from  <dig> rna-seq libraries of plutella xylostella, including  <dig> intergenic lncrnas,  <dig> intronic lncrnas,  <dig> anti-sense lncrnas and  <dig> sense-overlapping lncrnas. in addition, several lncrnas showed significant expression changes in the two chlorantraniliprole-resistant strains; some were identified as co-expressed with several genes involved in insecticide resistance, especially the ryanodine receptor, the target of chlorantraniliprole. these results provide solid bases for further investigation of the roles of lncrnas in regulation of chlorantraniliprole and other insecticide resistance and in other biological processes in p. xylostella.
