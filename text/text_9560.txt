BACKGROUND
in a recent update, hanahan and weinberg added reprogramming of energy metabolism to the list of hallmarks of cancer  <cit> . historically, cancer was regarded as metabolic disease long before being decoded as disease of genes and mutations. more than 80 years ago, otto warburg reported an increased anaerobic glycolysis in cancer cells compared to normal cells  <cit> . additional to the warburg effect  <cit> , cancer cells exhibit increased protein and nucleotide synthesis  <cit> , increased fatty acid synthesis and changes in fatty acid metabolism  <cit> . integrating data of different sources, models of the altered metabolism in cancer were developed, see for example  <cit> . in recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the altered metabolism of cancer cells coupled with progress in development of new metabolic drugs  <cit> . in order to obtain a comprehensive view on the metabolic changes between invasive carcinomas and normal breast tissues, herein a metabolomics study of breast cancer was carried out with a focus on the low molecular weight molecules of central metabolism. in a separate project, a breast cancer cohort was investigated by lipidomics with a focus on altered membrane lipid metabolism  <cit> .

analytical chemistry methods allow the investigation of the metabolic changes that occur in cancer tissues. using gas chromatography , liquid chromatography  or capillary electrophoresis  coupled with mass spectrometry  hundreds of molecules in a tissue sample can be analyzed simultaneously. in two preceding studies using gas chromatography followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry  we successfully profiled ovarian and colon cancer  <cit> . this approach, allowed the monitoring of hundreds of small molecules with masses of up to 500 da. using spectral libraries like binbase  <cit>  many of these metabolite peaks can be mapped to metabolites with known chemical structures and functions.

breast cancer is a public health issue of global relevance with more than one million new cases diagnosed annually and more than  <dig>  death cases worldwide  <cit> . after surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is offered to most breast cancer patients to reduce the risk of relapse. however, about 40% of the early breast cancer patients have a low risk of developing distant metastases and of dying because of the disease  <cit> . on the other hand, aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer have a poor prognosis and are difficult to treat  <cit> . new targeted therapies including small molecule inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies are currently under development and being tested in clinical trials  <cit> , however many of the new approaches achieved only limited response rates. therefore, as a step to personalized medicine, a better understanding of the functional pathway alterations in breast cancer is needed to avoid over-treatment and select patients for individualized and targeted therapies.

gc-tofms based metabolomics provides a wide coverage of the central part of the cellular metabolism including glycolysis, citrate cycle, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. these pathways are altered in cancer cells and can be targeted by metabolic drugs. herein, we report on the comparison of  <dig> invasive breast cancer samples with  <dig> normal tissue samples using gc-tofms. the purpose of this study is two-fold:  to analyze the metabolic changes in the central pathways between invasive carcinoma and normal breast tissues on a global scale and  to identify key metabolic markers that separate cancer from normal tissues with high sensitivity and specificity.

RESULTS
metabolomics analysis of breast cancer
the entire cohort of breast cancer and normal tissues was divided into a training set  and a validation set . analysis of the gc-tofms spectra of the ts samples led to the detection of  <dig> most abundant metabolite peaks that were present in breast cancer tissues. subsequently, these metabolites were measured in the vs.  <dig> of the detected metabolite peaks could confidently be mapped to known chemical structures and metabolite names.

using unsupervised analysis methods we investigated the contribution of the malignancy of the tissues to the total variance of the dataset. the results of a principal components analysis  of ts and vs are shown in figure  <dig>  in the ts, the first two pcs captured  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variance of the metabolomics data. in the ts, the 1st pc was significantly decreased in cancer compared to normal tissues . in the vs, the first two pcs captured  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variance. further, the 1st pc could be validated as being decreased in cancer compared to normal tissues . in summary, in ts and vs, the 1st pc captured more than one-third of the total variance of the metabolomics data and correlated strongly with the malignancy of the studied tissue samples.

metabolic changes between breast cancer and normal tissue
metabolite-by-metabolite analysis of the training set  led to detection of  <dig> significantly changed metabolites between cancer  and normal tissues . out of these,  <dig>  remained significant after bonferroni correction and  <dig>  could also be validated by analysis of the validation set . among the validated metabolites,  <dig> were decreased and  <dig> increased in tumors, corresponding to 53% and 26% of the entire set of metabolites detected by gc-tofms.

for functional analysis, profile clustering  <cit>  was used to order the metabolites according to their mutual proximity in the metabolic network. figure  <dig> shows the fold changes of  <dig> metabolites that are present in the kegg data base. by proceeding through the cluster map form left to right, the metabolic changes include up-regulation of many amino acids, changes in tca cycle, changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism, down-regulation of the benzoic acid family, up-regulation of most of the nucleotides and their phosphates, down-regulation of the sugar cluster including sucrose, fructose and glucose, and down-regulation of most of the free fatty acids.

a metabolic network was constructed using cytoscape with metscape plug-in . two metabolites were connected by an edge, if they can be converted into each other by an enzymatic reaction. in breast cancer tissues, glucose and other sugars were decreased while intermediates of the glycolysis pathway such as glucose-6-phosphate and 3-phospho-glycerate were increased. the equilibrium between pyruvate and lactate was shifted towards lactate. many compounds of the tca cycle were increased, with the exception of alpha-keto-glutarate that was decreased in cancer tissues.

strong deregulation occurred in glutamate metabolism with a shift of equilibrium from alpha-ketoglutarate  towards glutamate . nineteen proteinogenic amino acids  could be detected by the gc-tofms approach. out of these  <dig> were strongly increased in the cancer tissues . only one of the detected proteinogenic amino acids, asparagine, was decreased between cancer a normal tissues , while glutamine and arginine remained unchanged.

amphiphilic phospholipids are the building blocks of the cell membrane and are synthesized from choline and ethanolamine via the kennedy pathway. within this pathway, we have detected a shift of the equilibrium from ethanolamine  to phosphoethanolamine . nucleotides, nucleosides and their phosphates were generally increased in the cancer tissues with the strongest regulations belonging to cmp  and amp .

metabolite based separation of cancer and normal tissues
in order to develop a metabolite-based molecular approach for the detection of breast cancer, we analyzed each metabolite for its classifying power.  <dig> metabolites, of which  <dig> have a known chemical structure, separated tumor  from normal breast tissues  as well as tumor from normal adipose-rich tissues  with sensitivity and specificity >80%. the fold changes of these marker metabolites are shown in figure  <dig>  we found  <dig> tumor markers  and  <dig> normal tissue markers .

in order to enhance the separation, each of the tumors markers was divided by each of the normal tissues markers yielding 13 × 7 =  <dig> metabolite ratios that served as classifiers. for each classifier, we defined a cut-off value for the classification in cancer and normal tissues by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. then, we applied a voting system counting each of the classifiers above the cut-off + <dig>  and each of the classifier below the cut-off - <dig>  the votes for  <dig> classifiers were summed and the results are shown in figure  <dig>  a strong correlation was observed between the votes for different classifiers: for  <dig> tissue samples  there was unisonous agreement among all classifiers, for  <dig> tissue samples  more than 90% of the classifiers agreed on malignancy status.

next, we compared the classification result obtained by the majority of the classifiers with the histopathological classification that is the gold standard for cancer detection. only  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors and  <dig> out of  <dig> normal tissues were classified incorrectly, leading to a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> % of the molecular test. further, restricting the analysis to the  <dig> tissues where more than 90% of the classifiers agreed, only one tumor and four normal tissues were classified incorrectly, leading to a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %.

among all classifiers the ratio of cytidine-5-monophosphate / pentadecanoic acid had the highest significance for changing between cancer and normal tissues  and at the same time had the highest significance for changing between malignant and normal breast tissues . maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity lead to a cut-off value =  <dig> . using this cut-off point, only  <dig> out of  <dig> tumors and  <dig> out of  <dig> normal tissues were incorrectly classified leading to  <dig> % sensitivity and  <dig> % specificity. histogram and roc curve of the classifier are shown in figure  <dig> 

nearest centroid classification
we investigated the performance of classifiers including  <dig>   <dig>  …,  <dig> metabolites with known structure for the separation of cancer from normal tissues. to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the classifiers, we combined nearest centroid classification with a multiple random validation strategy, as in  <cit> . it turned out that on average a sensitivity of about 96% and a specificity of about 94% was obtained independent of the number of metabolites. the classification results did not improve when a larger number of metabolites was used for classification .

cmp : cytidine-5-monophosphate.the metabolite ratio method was developed in the current work. nearest centroid classification was executed using the r package cancerclass  <cit> . for the latter method, classification rates including 95% confidence intervals were estimated using multiple random validation.

discussion
our results show that tissues collected during breast surgery have reproducible metabolite profiles that can be analyzed by using gc-tofms. using this approach,  <dig> metabolite peaks could be detected and quantified; 79% of these were changed between cancer and normal tissues. thus, there is a difference in the concentrations of many metabolites between cancer and normal tissues including changes as high as tenfold and more for some metabolites. the high rate of validated metabolites in a predefined training-validation analysis, even after the conservative bonferroni correction, shows that the gc-tofms is a robust approach to detect the metabolite changes associated with malignant progression. data acquisition at different time points is considered as a main source of variance in many gc-ms studies. however, the high degree of reproducibility  between training and test data set underscores the robustness gc-tofms platform and of the detected metabolic changes in the current study.

a metabolic map of breast cancer was constructed by visualizing the metabolite changes in the metabolic network including pathways like glycolysis, tca cycle, nucleotide metabolism and catabolism of amino acids. the metabolic map can serve as a tool for hypothesis building about the metabolic processes in breast cancer and help to develop strategies for the therapeutic targeting of metabolism in cancer cells. several metabolic drugs, some of them targeting the central energy metabolism, are currently under development and investigated in clinical studies  <cit> .

cancer is commonly considered as a genetic disease that is driven by mutations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. however, one of the major underlying purposes of those genetic and gene expression changes is to create a metabolic phenotype for cancer cells that is essential for tumor cell growth and survival  <cit> . the metabolic phenotype of cancer includes alterations in glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism that were confirmed in the current study.

glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in blood plasma, can be metabolized to pyruvate and lactate through glutamate, alpha-keto-glutarate and via the citric acid cycle. this process, termed glutaminolysis is an important source of energy, carbon and nitrogen in cancer cells  <cit> . in the present study, we have observed strong regulation of this pathway including a strong up-regulation of glutamate  while glutamine was unchanged. this suggests that glutamine metabolism and in particular glutaminase, the enzyme that converts glutamine to glutamate, should be a potential target for intervention. in the 1980s three glutamine analogs raised great expectations as possible antineoplastic agents. but the promising results obtained in model systems could not be confirmed in clinical trials due to dose limiting side effects and ineffectiveness of treatment  <cit> . however, recently a small molecule inhibitor was shown to target gls  and to have antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cells while being unharmful to normal cells  <cit> . furthermore, a connection between myc , a master transcription factor and oncogene that is deregulated in many cancers and glutamine metabolism has been described  <cit> . myc is known to be amplified in about 5% of breast cancers and associated with a more aggressive subtype and shortened survival  <cit> .

in the gc-tofms metabolomics based approach we observed a two- to four-fold down-regulation of almost all detected free fatty acids . the down-regulation of fatty acids seems to contradict the up-regulation of fatty acid synthase  and increased de novo fatty acid synthesis that is found in many cancers  <cit> . interestingly, a lipidomics study of breast cancer showed an up-regulation of many membrane lipids in cancer compared to normal tissues  <cit> . thus, the metabolomics described in this paper together with the previously reported lipidomics data support the hypothesis that de novo fatty acid synthesis is potentially increased in breast cancer, but free fatty acids are rapidly metabolized to synthesize membrane phospholipids.

the gc-tofms data also showed a shift of the equilibrium from ethanolamine that was decreased to phospho-ethanolamine that was highly increased in the cancer tissues possibly indicating a stimulation of the kennedy pathway. to correlate these changes with the content of membrane lipids, we have extracted the total content of different kinds of membrane lipids from the uplc-ms data published before  <cit> . however, there were neither pronounced correlations between phospho-ethanolamine and the total content of phosphatidylethanolamine  nor between phospho-ethanolamine and the total content of phosphatidylcholine , see figure 7a. the mechanism behind might be that, in tumors tissues, the kennedy pathway is regulated in such a way, that a sufficient concentration of phospho-ethanolamine is always available. in fact, the same choline kinases that catalyse the reaction of choline to phospho-choline also catalyse the reaction of ethanolamine to phospho-ethanolamine. choline kinases were detected to be up-regulated in tumors and represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention  <cit> .

in order to develop a classifier that separates between cancer and normal tissues, we identified  <dig> increased metabolites and  <dig> decreased metabolites that separated cancer from normal tissues with sensitivity and specificity >80%. we did not detect any perfect biomarker in the sense that a single metabolite was abundant and specific to cancer tissue, but absent in normal tissues or vice versa. therefore, we built ratios of metabolites in order to construct scale-invariant tissue classifiers that are independent of the amount of tissue under investigation and do not depend on data normalization. these two-metabolite classifiers separated cancer from normal tissues with high sensitivity and specificity and had a high agreement among each other. in an extensive additional analysis we investigated the performance of classifiers that include a larger number of metabolites using a multiple random validation strategy. it turned out that classifiers including more metabolites did not outperform classifiers including only two metabolites . this result underscores the relevance of the two-metabolite ratio classifiers as a promising strategy for diagnostic classification.

the metabolite ratio cytidine-5-monophosphate/pentadecanoic acid showed the strongest discrimination between cancer and normal tissues and permitted detection of cancer with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and a specificity of  <dig> %. pentadecanoic acid  is a known fatty acid present in milk and it has been found to be a good marker of milk fat intake when found in serum. however, a heatmap of the free fatty acids shows a high correlation of the free fatty acids c14: <dig>  c15: <dig>  c16: <dig>  c17: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c20: <dig> in the metacancer cohort . thus, in the classifier, it is possible to replace pentadecanoic acid by some other saturated fatty acids. indeed, classifiers including ligoneric acid  or heptadecanoic acid  instead of pentadecanoic acid to a large extend coincide with the classifiers that include pentadecanoic acid.

for the detection of metabolite changes, we worked with a predefined training set  and validation set . all of the  <dig> most discriminatory metabolites are among the validated changed metabolites between cancer  and normal tissues . it should be noted, though, that normal breast tissue might consist of normal epithelium as well as various amounts of adipose tissue. therefore, it was important to distinguish different kinds of normal tissues  and to develop a classifier that is independent of the fat content of the tissue. thus, only metabolites that separated cancer from both, normal breast  and normal adipose-rich tissues  were included in the final classifier. this part of the analysis could only be performed in the pooled ts and vs due to a low number of normal breast samples. another limitation of the current study is its retrospective character and the use of preselected samples that were enriched for cancer or normal cells. the cancer classifiers developed here need to be further validated using random samples from biopsying or surgery. in doing so, concordance with histopathology  and reproducibility in repeated analyses of the same tissue  of the classifiers should be further evaluated.

a critical factor determining whether a method is applicable for routine cancer diagnostics, for example during surgery, is the time needed for sample analysis. in order to cope with the inherent heterogeneity nature of the tissues, it is necessary to probe various areas of the tissue and still keep the total analysis time in the range of minutes. there is recent progress in automation and miniaturization of ms devices and such tools are expected to become cheaper and easier to handle during the next few years  <cit> . first hand-portable, automated gc-ms devices is commercially available today  <cit> . additionally, an automated lc/ce-ms device in the size of a personal computer is being developed in the european arrows fp <dig> project  <cit> . automation of sample acquisition, preparation and data generation will be important to translate ms based tissue investigations approaches into clinical applications.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, a metabolic map of breast cancer was constructed by gc-tof analysis of a large cohort of breast cancer and normal tissues. in future, ms based devices could contribute to the analysis of biopsies and surgical samples. while metabolite analyses will not replace microscopic evaluation, metabolomics could be used complementary to histopathology, e.g. for an initial quality control of biopsies directly after sampling or as additional assessment method for biopsies or surgical samples.
