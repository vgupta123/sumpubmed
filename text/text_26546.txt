BACKGROUND
camelina sativa is a dicotyledonous plant in the family brassicaceae. it is commonly known as camelina, “gold-of-pleasure” or false flax. it has a growth cycle similar to that of arabidopsis <cit> . camelina has been cultivated as a source of vegetable oil in europe, central asia and north america. the life cycle of c. sativa is relatively short, spanning approximately 100–120 days; thus, the species is very suitable for renewable-resource generation and as a spring or fall rotation crop  <cit> . c. sativa has  <dig>  years of cultivation history. although it is an ancient crop, camelina cultivation has decreased gradually in modern times in relation to rapeseed  <cit> . the majority  of fatty acids in camelina oil are unsaturated; these are an important source of omega- <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . in camelina seeds, polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute more than 50% of the total, and linolenic acid  makes up about 35-40% of total fatty acids  <cit> . camelina is recommended as a dietary supplement because of these benefits. in addition to its dietary use, camelina oil has non-food applications, such as soaps, varnishes and biodiesel  <cit> . production of this oil may solve the problem of limited feedstock availability for bio-diesel production. camelina sativa would be useful as an alternative crop for biodiesel due to its low cost of production and high energy content. because of the relatively high ester yield, alkyl esters from camelina oil have been used as biodiesel  <cit> . camelina oil has also been used directly as a fuel for diesel transport engines  <cit> . a further advantage of camelina seed oil is that it produces less co <dig> than traditional mineral oil products  <cit> . moreover, camelina is more drought-resistant and frost-tolerant than rapeseed and can thus be grown on land with little fertilizer or on land that is fallow. in comparison with other oilseed plants, camelina is particularly competitive on highly saline soils  <cit> . the species is also well-known for its elevated resistance to insect pests and pathogens  <cit> .

a number of plant transcriptomes have been deeply sequenced and subjected to further analysis over the last decade, particularly in model species of monocotyledons  and dicotyledons . these analyses provide valuable databases for non-model plant species  <cit> . however, there is no est or genomic sequence currently available for camelina sativa in the genbank database. transcriptomic sequence data for this low-cost oilseed plant will provide a valuable source of genomic information for practitioners of plant sciences. in the present study, we adopted illumina paired-end sequencing to analyze the leaf transcriptome of camelina sativa. in total,  <dig>  gigabase pairs were obtained by deep sequencing; unigenes involved in most metabolic pathways were detected by our procedures. this is the first report of a transcriptome database for this oilseed plant. we provide a public dataset for genetic analysis and biological study of camelina sativa.

RESULTS
sequencing and transcriptome assembly by soapdenovo
total rna was extracted from young and mature leaves of camelina sativa. poly a+ mrna was obtained by passing total rna through a column of beads conjugated with oligo ; the product was then fragmented into short sequences . the shortened mrna was transcribed to cdna by reverse transcriptase before sequencing. clean “reads” were filtered from raw reads by removal of adaptors, ambiguous reads and low-quality reads. approximate  <dig> million clean reads  with a mean length of 90 bp were obtained . two assembly methods were adopted and compared . we used soapdenovo to assemble all high-quality clean reads into contigs , which were assembled into scaffolds  that were in turn assembled de novo into unigenes . we generated  <dig>  contigs  with a mean length of 182 bp and an n <dig> of 194 bp . the majority of contigs  were in the range  <dig> – 400 bp, which accounted for  <dig> % of total contigs  . in order to assemble scaffolds, the contigs were connected with n to represent unknown sequences between two contiguous contigs. details of scaffold total number, mean length and the n <dig> value are given in table  <dig>  most of the scaffolds  reads had gap length ratios of <  <dig>   and the most frequent lengths  were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt . after assembling the scaffolds de novo with soapdenovo software, we filled scaffold gaps with the lowest number of ns so that each scaffold could not be extended from either side. resulting sequences were defined as unigenes. in total,  <dig>  unigenes were generated with a mean unigene length of 319 bp and an n <dig> of 346 bp  . there were  <dig>  unigenes with ≥ 500 bp, and  <dig>  unigenes with ≥ 1000 bp; the majority of unigenes  had  <dig> to 500 bp . the frequency distributions of unigene lengths and ratios of gap length to size of assembled unigene are depicted in figures s1d and figure s1e, respectively. among all unigenes,  <dig> %  had gap lengths that were < 5% of total length . the random distribution of reads in assembled unigenes is presented in figure s1f to display sequencing bias.

de novo transcriptome assembly by trinity
to verify soapdenovo assembly results, we also made use of the trinity assembly method, which assembles full-length transcripts without reference genomes  <cit> . in total  <dig>  transcripts with a total length of  <dig> ,591 bp were generated , significantly exceeding the output from soapdenovo . the mean length and n <dig> obtained by trinity assembly were also longer than those obtained by soapdenovo .

to further verify the assembly results from both methods, we mapped both unigenes  and transcripts  to arabidopsis thaliana  cds sequences using blat . parameters of blat were set as default . of  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  were successfully mapped to cds in tair;  <dig>  of  <dig>  transcripts were also successfully mapped. of the total cds number in tair,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were mapped with sequences assembled by soapdenovo and trinity, respectively. among the mapped cds in tair,  <dig> %  were generated by both methods. thus, similar mapping results were obtained from the two assembly methods when the arabidopsis thaliana genome was taken as a reference genome. we adopted soapdenovo output for further analyses.

annotation of predicted proteins in nr and swiss-prot databases
in total,  <dig>  unigenes were annotated with  <dig>  unique protein ids. most protein ids  were annotated by the nr database. to annotate gene names and protein coding sequences among unigenes, we searched all six-frame translations of unigenes against the nr plant protein database in ncbi by running blastx with an e-value cut-off  <dig> e- <dig>  in total,  <dig>  blastx hits  were obtained, covering  <dig> % of all unigenes . of these,  <dig>  and  <dig>  blastx hits were matched to arabidopsis thaliana  and a. lyrata proteins, respectively. only  <dig> blastx hits were aligned to nr protein of brassica spp. . thus, camelina sativa was genetically more closely related to arabidopsis than brassica. the e-value frequency distribution of significant hits  showed that 26% of the sequences shared strong homologies; the majority of matched sequences  had e-values in the range  <dig> e-50– <dig> e- <dig> . the translated amino acid sequences of unigenes were also closely similar to sequences from the nr database; nearly 90% of the blastx hits were in a similarity range between 40% and 100%. only  <dig> % of hits had similarity values less than 40% . homologies between different species are depicted in figure 1e. among hits,  <dig> % matched to arabidopsis thaliana, followed in sequence by a. lyrata  and brassica  .

we also matched protein coding sequences of unigenes with the protein database at swiss-prot using blastx;  <dig>  of  <dig>  unigenes  returned hits at an e-value threshold of ≤  <dig> e- <dig> . most of the matched sequences  had e-values between  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig>  and the remaining  <dig> % had strong homologies with e-values of ≤ <dig> e- <dig> . the similarity frequency distribution against swiss-prot was different from that obtained against the nr database;  <dig> % of query sequences against swiss-prot had similarities between 20% and 80%; only  <dig> % of sequences had strong homologies with >80% identity .

conserved domain annotation and cog classification
cog is a database built on phylogenetic relationships of protein sequences from  <dig> genomes, including bacteria, plants and animals. individual proteins or paralogs from at least three lineages are categorized in each cog to represent an ancient conserved domain. within the camelina sativa unigene set,  <dig>  were categorized  in  <dig> functional cog clusters . thus, only a small proportion of the unigenes  carried protein domains with annotation for cog categories. the five largest categories were: 1) general function predictions only , 2) post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones , 3) transcription , 4) translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis , and 5) replication, recombination and repair .

gene ontology  classification
to functionally categorize camelina sativa unigenes, we assigned go terms to each assembled unigene  <cit> . the camelina unigenes were categorized in three main go categories: biological process , cellular component  and molecular function . these go terms were further subdivided into  <dig> sub-categories . in total,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to at least one of the go categories of biological process, cellular component and molecular function . the transcriptome of camelina sativa was closely related to arabidopsis thaliana sequences . only  <dig> % of unigenes  had higher homology with genes from brassica spp. a substantial number  of these  <dig> unigenes were annotated as disease resistance proteins. they accounted for  <dig> % of total unigenes annotated to brassica sequences . after overlapping unigenes were filtered,  <dig> individual nr ids matched brassica sequences; among these,  <dig> nr ids matched brassica disease resistance proteins .

kegg pathway mapping
unigenes of camelina sativa were mapped to kegg pathways by using the translated amino acids to run blastx against the kegg database. all returned hits with an e-value ≤  <dig> e- <dig> were annotated with enzyme commission  numbers  <cit> . using arabidopsis thaliana as a reference for pathways analysis, we annotated and mapped  <dig>  of  <dig>  unigenes  to ec numbers in  <dig> kegg pathways . metabolic pathways had the largest number of unigenes , followed in sequence by secondary metabolite biosynthesis , plant-pathogen interaction , spliceosome , protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum , and starch and sucrose metabolism  .

overall,  <dig>  unique sequence-based annotations had blastx scores with e-values ≤  <dig> e- <dig> in the nr, swiss-prot and kegg databases . among this number,  <dig>  unigenes had hits in all four public databases , with relatively well defined functional annotations . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, structures, functions, and pathways that will guide research on camelina sativa.

protein coding sequence  prediction
unigenes were firstly aligned by blastx  to protein databases in the priority order nr, swiss-prot, kegg, cog. unigenes aligned to a high priority database were not aligned to databases of lower priority. the process ended when all alignments had been performed. the correct reading frame of the nucleotide sequences of unigenes  was defined by the highest rank in the blast results, and the corresponding protein sequences were obtained from the standard codon table. unigenes that could not be aligned to any database were scanned with estscan  <cit>  to produce the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the predicted region. in total, cds of  <dig>  unigenes were generated by blastx protein database searches described above. to evaluate the quality of the databases, we analyzed the ratio of gap lengths to the sizes of unigene cds. almost all of the unigenes had gap lengths that were < 5% of total length, accounting for  <dig> % of total unigenes with cds sequences  . the majority of the unigene cds  had < 500 bp. of  <dig>  unigenes with cds sequences,  <dig>  had ≥ 500 bp and  <dig>  had ≥ 1000 bp. the size frequency distributions of these unigene cds and proteins are depicted in figure s4b and s4c, respectively . we scanned  <dig>  cds of unigenes that could not be aligned to any database by estscan. of these, only two had gaps . the majority of the unigene cds assigned by estscan  were shorter than 500 bp ; this was also the case for protein sequences obtained from estscan .

fatty acid pathways in camelina sativa and arabidopsis thaliana
fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long hydrocarbon chains that are saturated or unsaturated. the carbon atoms per molecule vary from  <dig> to  <dig>  in camelina seeds, most of the fatty acids are unsaturated and the oil has high omega- <dig> fatty acid content . eggs from hens and milk from cows fed camelina meal contain elevated contents of unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . in our annotated camelina sativa transcriptome unigene dataset, we identified key genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis . camelina sativa shares pathways similar to those of arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . however, not all gene members in the arabidopsis genome were identified in the transcriptome dataset. for example, there are  <dig> homologous stearoyl-acp desaturase genes  in the genome of arabidopsis <cit> , but only four of these can find highly homologous unigenes  in the transcriptome dataset . the other three members may not be expressed in leaves, or may be absent from the genome of c. sativa.

discussion
high-throughput sequencing is a superior technology for transcriptome analysis. compared with traditional large-scale est sequencing, it is less costly and more efficient. it is more suitable for use in non-model organisms whose genomic sequences are unknown. prior to our work, there was no sequencing information on camelina sativa in public databases. we used rna-seq technology for transcriptome profiling to sequence rna extracted from leaves. this de novo transcriptome sequencing technology has been used for many plants, including rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , sesame  <cit> , bamboo  <cit> , poplar  <cit> . however, illumina transcriptome analysis has been restricted previously to the sequencing of organisms for which reference genomes were available  <cit> . the illumina sequence technology has improved recently, most notably through an expanded capability for de novo sequencing of relatively short reads and their assembly into unigenes by paired-end sequencing technology  <cit> . paired-end sequencing not only increases the depth of sequencing, but also improves de novo assembly efficiency. through this procedure, we obtained  <dig>  g bp reads with  <dig>  million clean reads. all of these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes by soapdenovo and  <dig>  transcripts by trinity. while the output was consistent with a previous study on the camellia sinensis transcriptome  <cit> , the hexaploid genome of camelina sativa add complexity to the analysis  <cit> . when the assembled  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  transcript were mapped to arabidopsis cds ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique arabidopsis cds could be mapped, respectively . multiple unigenes could be mapped to the same cds as they cover different regions of the cds; and  <dig> or  <dig> unigenes could be mapped to the same cds due to the polyploidy of camelina. six camelina genes expressed in developing seeds were shown to have  <dig> haplotypes in ecotype cs <dig>  <cit> . to confirm that camelina ecotype mt- <dig> is also a hexaploid, these  <dig> sequences were mapped to the clean reads and the unigenes/transcripts produced by soapdenovo and trinity by blastn with perfect match and e-value ≤  <dig> e- <dig>  three out of the six genes could find  <dig> haplotypes from our clean reads database, confirming that ecotype mt- <dig> is also a hexaploid . some unigenes/transcripts are actually different haplotypes of the same gene. for example, three unigenes  were found to be the three haplotypes of the homologous gene of at2g <dig>  this reflects the complexity of assembling polyploidy transcriptome. currently no existing assembler can handle polyploidy well.

transcriptome analysis indicates that camelina sativa is closely related to arabidopsis thaliana . a particular example of this relatedness is the presence of atpap2-like  and atpap9-like  sequences in the transcriptome of camelina sativa . cspap <dig> shares 91% amino acid sequence identity with atpap2; cspap <dig> shares 89% amino acid sequence identity with atpap <dig>  in arabidopsis and camelina, two paps carry a c-terminal hydrophobic motif, but only one pap-like sequence is known to carry this hydrophobic motif at the c-terminus in other plant genomes. for example, of  <dig> pap-like genes in the soybean genome, only one pap sequence  carries this c-terminal motif  <cit> . overexpression of atpap <dig> in a. thaliana produces fast-growth and high seed-yield phenotypes  <cit> . overexpression of atpap <dig> in camelina sativa also produces fast-growth and high seed-yield phenotypes  <cit> . it would be worthwhile investigating whether this effect is specific only to a. thaliana and c. sativa. of particular interest would be identification of the physiological mechanism underlying this difference among plant species. is this merely the result of a random gene duplication event during the evolution of a. thaliana and c. sativa, and what is the physiological function of the single pap sequence with the specific c-terminal hydrophobic motif in other plant species?

due to their close genetic relationship, camelina sativa and arabidopsis thaliana share similar kegg pathways. we generated  <dig> kegg pathways from the c. sativa transcriptome and compared them with pathways in a. thaliana. some pathways in the two species were identical, including pathways involved in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, biotin metabolism, citrate cycle , fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, glycosaminoglycan degradation, proteasome and protein export. moreover, except in a few cases, most of the genes involved in these pathways were highly similar between the two species .

while most of the unigenes had high sequence identity to arabidopsis sequences , a small proportion  of defense-related unigenes were closely similar to brassica sequences . we identified a non-trivial proportion of these as disease resistance genes. plants have developed defense systems for protection against pathogen invasion. in plant genomes, the nucleotide-binding site -encoding resistance genes belong to one of the largest gene families and account for approximately 2% of all genes. nbs-encoding genes of some monocotyledons and dicotyledons, including oryza sativa <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , brassica rapa <cit> , and populus trichocarpa <cit> , have been studied using model species as reference organisms. in b. rapa,  <dig> non-redundant nbs-encoding genes have been identified  <cit> . of  <dig> camelina unigenes that matched brassica sequences,  <dig> were disease resistance genes  . the conservation of these disease-resistance genes in camelina over evolutionary time scales implies that camelina and b. rapa have been exposed to the threats from closely-related pathogens.

glucosinolates are secondary metabolites of the brassicales that play important roles in plant defense. most genes that encode glucosinolates biosynthesis in arabidopsis have been clearly identified and may be used as reference loci for research on camelina glucosinolate genes  <cit> . we screened all unigenes of c. sativa by matching them to the query sequence of arabidopsis thaliana genes using blastx tools. except for aop <dig>  cyp79f <dig>  myb <dig> and fmogs-ox2~ <dig>  all homologs of glucosinolate synthesis genes in a. thaliana are found in brassica rapa <cit> . however, we found homologs of aop <dig>  cyp79f <dig>  myb <dig> and fmogs-ox2~ <dig> in the transcriptome of c. sativa , again confirming the close relationship between this species and a. thaliana.

CONCLUSIONS
using the illumina platform, we derived by paired-end and de novo technology a dataset comprising  <dig>  unigenes from the camelina sativa transcriptome. of these,  <dig>  were annotated with gene descriptions from nr, swiss-prot, cog and kegg databases. after removal of redundancies,  <dig>  non-redundant sequences were obtained. we discovered differences between kegg pathways of a. thaliana and c. sativa . though both of these species belong to the brassicaceae and share a close genetic relationship, there was inter-specific variation in genes involved in some metabolic pathways. this is a first report of camelina sativa transcriptome analysis; it provides a valuable database for further research on this species.
