BACKGROUND
aldehyde dehydrogenase  is a family of enzymes involved in metabolism of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids  <cit> . it plays an important role in metabolism of vitamin a as well as in mechanisms of resistance to alchylating agents, e.g. cyclophosphamide  <cit> . for these reasons, aldh is considered a protecting or detoxifying enzyme, able to preserve stem cells from cytotoxic effects  <cit> . one of the accepted technologies to identify human hematopoietic stem cells  is based upon flow cytometry  detection of aldh enzymatic activity  <cit> . in particular, storms et al  <cit>  designed a substrate for aldh, termed bodipy aminoacetaldehyde , which consists of an aminoacetaldehyde moiety bonded to the bodipy fluorochrome. once baaa diffuses freely into cells and it is converted by aldh into bodipy aminoacetate , it remains trapped intracellularly, so emitting green fluorescence  <cit> .

recently, the functional role of aldh has been elucidated in a study, in which the specific inhibitor of aldh, diethylaminobenzaldehyde , was able to alter the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control self-renewal capacity of human hsc  <cit> .

the evidence of aldh involvement in the physiology of hsc was further highlighted by a series of studies devoted to purification/analysis of highly immature progenitor cells, particularly in human cord blood  as well as in murine bone marrow   <cit> . the importance of aldh in human hematopoiesis was also testified by a recent study in which the authors tried to purify hscs by combining fcm cell sorting and hoechst- <dig> efflux ability   <cit> . at variance with previous findings obtained in mouse, human bm hematopoietic cells able to exclude hoechst- <dig> did not correspond to highly immature hscs. on the other hand, the authors proposed that aldh activity had to be considered as the reference method for the detection of immature hscs in human bm, at the same time emphasizing the need of studies about expression pattern of aldh in comparison with other hematopoietic cell markers in this tissue  <cit> .

thanks to the relevant advances deriving from studies performed by gentry and coworkers  <cit> , it was definitely understood that aldhbright cell population in banked cord blood is highly enriched in hematopoietic colony forming cells , compared to aldhdim cell populations  <cit> . moreover, cell sorting of aldhbright cells in human bm enables a marked enrichment of cfc-h as well as of endothelial and fibroblast colonies  <cit> .

starting from these literature data, we carried out a comprehensive fcm characterization of human normal bm by detecting aldh in combination with other hematopoietic cell markers. to this aim, we used a multidimensional polychromatic approach, according to international guidelines  <cit> .

the goal of our work was to better define the expression of surface antigens classically associated with early steps of hematopoiesis such as cd <dig>  cd45ra, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> in three bm cellular compartments identified on the basis of aldh and cd <dig> expression. we were also interested to derive information about the possible erythroid lineage commitment of these identified subpopulations of cells.

methods
normal bm samples were obtained, following informed consent, from  <dig> patients with non-hodgkin lymphoma  who underwent bm aspiration in the context of routine clinical practice. all samples showed complete absence of neoplastic cells when analyzed by smear morphology, bm biopsy and fcm. peripheral blood counts were in normal ranges. thus, all bm aspirates included in the study were operationally considered as normal. written informed consent was obtained from all patients before the study.

three patients with pure red cell aplasia  were also included in the study. also in this case, bm samples were obtained following informed consent.

in the first phase of the study, we analyzed bm cells by four-color fcm, detecting aldh activity along with the expression of a series of hematopoietic antigens. directly conjugated fluorescent antibodies were used reacting with the following antigens: cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd45ra, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd235a. in particular, pe conjugated monoclonal antibodies  against cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd45ra and cd <dig> were obtained from miltenyi biotec , caltag , beckman-coulter  and r&d systems , respectively. pe-conjugated anti-cd <dig>  anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd235a, along with apc-conjugated anti-cd <dig>  pe-cy <dig> conjugated anti cd <dig> and percp-conjugated anti-cd <dig> were purchased from becton dickinson .

for all antibody staining experiments,  <dig> μl of whole bm sample were incubated at 4°c for  <dig> min in the presence of appropriate amount of moabs in pbs. successively, the mixtures were diluted 1: <dig> in ammonium chloride  lysing solution, then incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes and finally washed with staining media prior to flow cytometry analysis. in experiments where bm samples were stained with baaa and additional antibodies, the antibody reagents were incubated with the cells at a concentration of  <dig> cells/ml for  <dig> minutes prior to baaa staining. cells with low side scatter and high levels of baaa staining were defined as "side scatter low aldh bright"  cells. aldh activity was assessed by the bodipy-based aldefluor assay , according to the manufacturer method. as negative control, we used deab, a potent inhibitor of aldh activity. antibody and baaa stained cells were analyzed on a facscalibur flow cytometer  equipped with a 488-nm argon laser and a 635-nm red diode laser. bodipy fluorescence was excited at  <dig> nm and fluorescence emission was detected using a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate  530/ <dig> bandpass filter. levels of cd antigen expression were displayed as mean fluorescence intensity . the software used for cytometric analysis was paint-a-gate .

cell sorting experiments were performed by the cell sorter facsaria  equipped with blue, red, and violet lasers. dead cells were excluded by analyzing forward scatter  vs side scatter  dot plots. doublets were excluded by fsc-h vs fsc-a dot plots. three populations of cells were sorted: aldh-cd34+, aldh+cd34+ and aldh+cd34-. in all experiments, purity was higher than 95% of desired cells.

immunophenotyping of patients with prca was performed by the flow cytometer facscanto , by using a 5-colour strategy .

induction of differentiation studies were performed according to malik et al . in brief, aldh+cd34+ and aldh+cd34- cells were purified from three different normal bone marrow samples and were cultured at a density of  <dig> cells/ml in iscove's modified dulbecco's medium , 1% deionized bovine serum albumin , 10- <dig> mol/l 2-mercaptoethanol, 10- <dig> mol/l hydrocortisone,  <dig> u/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and  <dig> mmol/l l-glutamine with the following recombinant cytokines:  <dig> u/ml of recombinant human  epo ,  <dig>  ng/ml rh granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor , and  <dig>  u/ml rh interleukin- <dig>  and incubated in 5% co <dig> at 37°c. we strictly followed the indications of the reported method  <cit> , culturing aldh+cd34+ cells and aldh+cd34- cells in the aforementioned culture conditions for  <dig> days in order to demonstrate our hypothesis that aldh+cd34- cells were committed erythroid precursors.

descriptive statistics included medians, lowest and highest values, and 95% ci for the medians. statistical significance was assessed by paired wilcoxon test.

RESULTS
intracellular fluorescence staining of aldh was combined with ssc with the aim of facilitating the identification of aldh+ stem cells and progenitor cells. in facts, it is well known that hscs and progenitors typically have low ssc on facs analysis  <cit> . a population of cells with low ssc and high levels of baaa staining  was evident in bm aspirates of all the  <dig> subjects studied . in contrast, when bm aspirate was stained simultaneously with baaa and deab, a potent inhibitor of aldh, no sscloaldhbr cells were noted . the absence of aldh staining in the presence of aldh inhibitor confirms that the presence of sscloaldhbr population is specifically due to high-level aldh activity in these cells.

in order to better define the bm cellular compartments in terms of aldh and cd <dig> expression, we performed a multimensional fcm analysis using the paint-a-gate software . we identified three distinct populations of cells in all  <dig> samples analyzed: aldh+/cd34-, aldh-/cd34+ and aldh+/cd34+. in particular, in figure  <dig>  we first imposed a green gate on aldh+ cells, then a red gate on cd34+ cells  and finally the events falling at the same time in the green as well as red gates were automatically depicted in yellow by the software. the median percentages of aldh+/cd34- , aldh-/cd34+  and aldh+/cd34+  cells were  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. the denominator of these percentages was composed by the entire population of nucleated bone marrow cells following to nh4cl lysis of mature erythrocytes. note that the green population  was simultaneously negative for cd <dig> and cd <dig> .

starting from this point, the work was carried out with the aim of identifying the immunophenotype of the three aforementioned cell populations.

firstly, we focused on differential expression of cd <dig>  cd45ra, cd <dig> and cd <dig> in cd34+aldh+ and cd34+aldh- cells . as compared to cd34+aldh- cells, cd34+aldh+ cells were characterized by lower expression of activation-differentiation antigens cd <dig>  and cd45ra  and by higher expression of stem cell antigen cd <dig>  and cd <dig> .

* values are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity . negative controls on cd34+ gated cells showed in any cases mfi lower than  <dig> units.

taken together, aldh, cd <dig> and cd <dig> compose an immunophenotypic mosaic related to an undifferentiated status, while cd <dig> and cd45ra expression indicates a higher degree of cell maturation. to confirm this view, figure  <dig> shows the inverse correlation between cd <dig> and aldh. interestingly, in all cases studied the highest expression of aldh strictly corresponded to the lowest expression of cd <dig> 

our attention was focused on aldh+/cd34- cell population. as shown in figure  <dig>  aldh+/cd34- cells  were characterized by cd <dig> bright expression  accompanied by cd <dig> high expression level . moreover, cd <dig> and cd <dig> antigens were tightly co-expressed  and overall population defined by aldh, cd <dig> and cd <dig> positivity was also characterized by high volume, as detected by forward scatter measurement .

discussion
in spite of the existence of a series of studies describing aldh expression in human cb  <cit> , peripheral blood stem cells  <cit>  and even acute myeloid leukemia  bm cells  <cit>  data aiming to characterize normal bm aldh+ cells are still limited to a few recent reports  <cit> .

the use of nh4cl lysed, unseparated bone marrow for immunophenotypic studies is strongly recommended by clinico-hematological guidelines  <cit> . in this work we decided to follow these recommendations, so that bm samples were not processed by density gradient separation to the aim of avoiding unwanted selection of cell subsets, and, at the same time, of not interfering with assay interpretation  <cit> .

our interest in aldh detection relies on the consideration that fcm based aldh activity assessment is exploited in order to evidence a conserved stem cell function, rather than to merely identify a stem cell antigen  <cit> .

the first result of this study, based upon the simultaneous identification of aldh activity and a detailed immunophenotype profile, is that the contemporary expression of cd <dig> and high levels of aldh is able to identify primitive bm hematopoietic progenitors, clearly expressing high amounts of cd <dig> and cd <dig> as well as low amounts of cd <dig> and cd45ra. these data are in keeping with findings reported by hess, pearce and gentry groups on cb cells  <cit> . they found that aldhbright cells were able to give multilineage hematopoietic repopulation and, when compared to their aldhlo counterparts, they expressed higher amounts of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and lower amounts of cd <dig>  <cit> .

our study shares some arguments with the work by gentry et al on human bone marrow  <cit> . similarly to our work, these authors characterized aldhbright cells with a series of moabs directed to surface antigens, e.g. cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  hla-dr and cd <dig>  nevertheless, there is one difference between our study and gentry's work. while gentry and coworkers  <cit>  used a 3-color plus 7-aad  scheme, thus comparing the expression of aldh with  <dig> surface antigens, we combined aldh analysis with  <dig> surface antigens. such a multidimensional strategy allowed us to obtain the core finding of our work, i.e. the detection of a consistent population of cells characterized by the simultaneous presence of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and aldh, in the absence of cd <dig>  in this regard, if aldh+/cd34- cell subset may also contain a very rare, primitive stem cell remains to be demonstrated and it is conceivable that a specific marker for the selection of human cd34-negative stem cells needs to be identified before definite conclusions are made, as suggested by other research groups  <cit> . however, in our study the majority of cells we identified by aldh+/cd34-/cd45- immunophenotype appeared to be committed, lineage antigen positive, non-stem cells. in particular, we demonstrated that these cells display precise erythroid features, i.e. cd <dig> and cd71bright expression in all  <dig> normal bm samples analyzed. the expression of these two antigens along with cd <dig> negativity is consistent with erythroid precursors  <cit> . this finding is intriguing because little direct information is available about the phenotypic features of erythroid precursors, as these cells are both sparse and difficult to isolate in sufficient numbers to be studied  <cit> .

in order to further characterize aldh+cd34- cells we performed cell sorting isolation of aldh+cd34+ and aldh+cd34- cell subsets, followed by short term cell culture experiments in which we were able to induce the expression of gpa only on aldh+cd34- cells. these experiments, which strictly followed indications by malik et al  <cit>  who recapitulated the entire erythropoietic process in vitro, were the proof of eythroid commitment of aldh+cd34- cells in normal bone marrow.

we also decided to further confirm erythroid commitment of aldh+cd34- cells in a disease model. interestingly, we demonstrated that three prca patients were completely devoid of this cellular subset, thus allowing us to hypothesize the use of this cytometric approach as a diagnostic tool in this kind of disease.

taken together, our data indicate aldh as a suitable tool to identify early steps of erythropoiesis as well as to isolate erythroid precursors by cell sorting. moreover, given the lack of sufficient numbers of reliable erythroid markers in diagnostic panels  <cit>  aldh could also have possible application in the field of prca and myelodysplasia fcm diagnosis.

finally, a possible application of aldh detection by fcm to the field of acute leukemia may derive from the study of cheung et al  <cit> , in which the authors described aldh expression in aml. they noted that in aml patients in complete remission, a relevant population of cells characterized by high aldh activity remained  <cit> . in this regard, our data concerning multidimensional expression profile of aldh combined with other hematopoietic antigens in normal bm precursors could represent the basis to distinguish by fcm leukemic from normal aldh+ cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we demonstrated that aldh+cd34- cells are mainly committed towards erythropoiesis. this finding is new and could be relevant for human physiology studies about erythropoietic differentiation as well as for proposing the utilization of aldh as a red cell marker in multidimensional flow cytometry characterization of bone marrow from patients with aplastic anemia  and myelodysplasia.
