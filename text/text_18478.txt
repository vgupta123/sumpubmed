BACKGROUND
in cows, disorders of mammary gland function are most often caused by inflammation from a bacterial infection as the main mastitis pathogens  <cit> . however, inflammation depends on both environmental factors as well as immune system efficiency  <cit> . mechanisms of the immune response depend on different populations of cells and their secreted mediators . expression profile analysis of immune system genes in the mammary gland tissues of both healthy animals and those infected by different pathogens may help explain the specific immune response mechanisms. furthermore, these analyses could indicate the tissue-specific physiological processes and biochemical pathways involved in different types of infections. moreover, this knowledge could be essential for the therapy and eradication of mastitis  <cit> . microarray technology enables the user to measure vast amounts of gene expression data under different physiological circumstances simultaneously, and, therefore, it allows for the identification of the genes involved in the defense of the host against microbial infection  <cit> . it also aids in understanding the processes that occur during mastitis  <cit> .

studies on gene expression profiles in mammary gland tissues and bovine milk leukocytes have been previously performed. swanson et al.   <cit>  reported differences in the expression level of several hundred genes in response to an infection by streptococcus uberis, including a large number of genes associated with the immune system. mitterhuemer et al.  <cit>  studied the influence of escherichia coli on the local  and systemic  transcriptome in the mammary glands of dairy cattle. they revealed that local inflammation influenced the expression of genes engaged in the immune response and inflammation, while the systemic response covered the expression of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, cytokines, protein degradation, and apoptosis. lützow et al.   <cit>  identified two main groups of genes  differentially expressed in the mammary gland of cows in response to infection by staphylococcus aureus. the up-regulated genes encoded proteins involved in intracellular signaling, primarily cytokines and chemokines. the genes with lower expression were encoded for extracellular matrix proteins, cellular cytoskeleton proteins, receptors, and intracellular signaling proteins. moreover, gilbert et al.  <cit>  found that crude e. coli lipopolysaccharide , the endotoxin of the gram-negative bacteria, stimulated expression of many more genes than the s. aureus infection did. they also stated that lps induced different mechanisms of leukocyte enrollment.

however, most of these studies were carried out either in vitro on cultured cells derived from mammary gland tissues  <cit> , on experimentally infected animals , or on milk somatic cells derived from mastitic cows  <cit> . moreover, it should be noted that krappmann et al.  <cit>  proved that mammary gland epithelial cells, obtained from milk somatic cells using magnetic beads, probably did not reflect the metabolic processes proceeding in secretory cells of the mammary gland itself; therefore, they could not substitute the study on the mammary gland biopsies. other researchers comparing results obtained in vitro and in vivo in different tissues draw similar conclusion in that the in vitro study does not fully reflect the conditions occurring in the living organism . thus, the present study was performed in vivo in animals with recurrent and incurable mammary gland inflammation. the aim of the study was transcriptional profiling and bioinformatics analysis of genes expressed in secretory tissue  derived from dairy cow mammary glands naturally infected with coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci in comparison with those of healthy mammary glands.

RESULTS
the microbiological status of the collected mammary gland samples, as well as information on the average lactose content and milk somatic cell count, was presented in detail previously  <cit> . briefly, the microbial status showed that 30% of studied samples were free from bacterial pathogens. in the remaining samples, only bacteria from staphylococcus genus were found. the lowest level of somatic cells was found in milk of healthy cows being in 1st or 2nd lactations and the highest in the milk of cows in 3rd or 4th lactations infected with coagulase-positive staphylococci.

comparison of gene expression profiles in coagulase-positive staphylococci-infected and healthy mammary gland parenchyma
comparing transcript levels in the secretory epithelial tissue of cows infected with coagulase-positive staphylococci in the 1st or 2nd lactation  and in healthy cows  identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes , meeting the criteria of log fc >  <dig>  and p <  <dig> . among these genes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in bacteria-infected cows. for these genes,  <dig> biological processes,  <dig> molecular functions, and  <dig> cellular component categories were ascribed . in the bacteria-infected udders, degs were associated with the immune defense response, immune system processes, response to wounding, amino acid transport, transportation of metabolic oxoacids, and ketone metabolic processes. when genes were classified according to their molecular functions, the degs were responsible for the activities of chemokines, cytokines and their receptors, protein binding, transmembrane transporter activity, and nucleotide binding. the cellular component genes included those encoding proteins of major histocompatibility complex  classes i and ii. ten categories of the most differentially expressed genes representing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the charts show the categories hierarchized according to increasing p values.

a comparison of the transcriptomes of cows from the cops-1/ <dig> and h groups identified the network of genes responsible for the migration of immune cells. in this network, the “nodes” represent key genes up-regulated in the cops-1/ <dig> group: mmp <dig> , plau , anxa <dig> , col1a <dig> , and timp <dig> . in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the “cellular movement, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking” network is presented with differentially expressed genes and key genes included in this network.

in cows undergoing the 3rd or 4th lactations ,  <dig> degs were identified, meeting the criteria of logfc >  <dig>  and p <  <dig> . there were  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in cops-3/ <dig> as compared to h . the degs were involved in  <dig> biological processes,  <dig> molecular functions, and  <dig> cellular component categories. the biological processes influenced by degs included inflammatory responses stimulus responses, lipid biosynthesis, and neutral lipid metabolic processes. the identified molecular functions primarily represented cytokine and chemokine activity as well as their receptors, peptidase activity, magnesium ion binding and oxidoreductase activity. in the cellular component category, genes encoding mhc  protein systems were identified. ten categories of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of the most differentially expressed genes are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  comparison of mammary parenchyma transcriptomes of cows from the cops-3/ <dig> and h groups revealed four networks of genes which differ in expression level:  network of cell metabolism,  network of the organization and function of the cells,  network of the inflammatory response, and  network of the response to infection and development of cells and tissues. networks a, b, and c contain, respectively, the node  genes up-regulated in the cops-3/ <dig> group: fos , ilβ , and tnf . additional file 3: figure s <dig> shows the identified networks with differentially expressed genes.

comparison of gene expression profiles in healthy and coagulase-negative staphylococci-infected mammary gland parenchyma
comparing transcript levels of the mammary gland parenchyma of the cons-1/ <dig> group  with the h group identified  <dig> degs, meeting the criteria of logfc >  <dig>  and p <  <dig> . of these genes,  <dig> showed increased  and  <dig> had decreased  expression in animals infected by bacteria. for these genes,  <dig> biological processes, five molecular functions, and nine cell component categories were identified . biological processes where degs were represented included defense response, stress response, antigen presentation, and inflammatory response. in the case of molecular function categories, odorant binding, receptor binding, and rna binding were highly associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci infection of the mammary secretory tissues. for cellular component categories, degs belonged to a group of genes encoding mhc and extracellular matrix proteins. ten categories of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of the most differentially expressed genes are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> according to increasing p value. in the cons-1/ <dig> group, a network of genes responsible for intercellular signaling, including egr <dig>  and tgfb <dig>  as key genes , that represented intragenic network were identified .

gene expression analysis profiles of udder parenchyma of cows in their 3rd or 4th lactations, infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci , identified  <dig> degs, meeting the criteria of logfc >  <dig>  and p <  <dig> . among these,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in the group infected with bacteria. these genes were involved in  <dig> biological processes,  <dig> molecular functions, and  <dig> cellular component categories . in the case of biological processes, genes with differed expression were those engaged in the defense response, immune response, signal transduction, lipid biosynthesis, and organic acid metabolism. as to the molecular function, these genes were responsible for protein binding, chemokine activity, calcium ion binding, protein homodimerization, and lipid binding. among the cellular component categories, genes encoding cell surface proteins and mhc i proteins were identified. ten categories of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of the most differentially expressed genes, categorized by increasing p value, are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

genes involved in the response to cons infection form five gene networks:  cell morphology,  organization of the cells,  cell proliferation,  reaction to tissue injury, and  humoral response . in these networks, several “node” genes were distinguished: ubc  for network a, fos for network b, tnf for network c, sod <dig>  for network d, and il2r  and ptgs <dig>  for network e.

kegg biochemical pathway analysis
to determine over-represented biochemical pathways, including genes up-regulated during staphylococci infections, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database was searched . in cows from the cons-1/ <dig> group several pathways associated with the body’s response to the presence of bacteria were identified. for all pathways, the differences between infected and non-infected udders were significant at p <  <dig> . importantly, all identified pathways were associated with immunological processes. a comparison of groups cops-1/ <dig> vs. h identified  <dig> pathways, including genes involved in the immune response. analysis of cops-3/ <dig> vs. h groups identified  <dig> pathways and cons-3/ <dig> vs. h revealed  <dig> pathways. for all three comparisons, changes in pathways of complement and coagulation cascades, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, antigen processing and presentation, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, nucleotide oligomerization domain -like and toll-like receptors, chemokine signaling and cell adhesion molecules  were identified.table  <dig> pathways and number of genes up- or down-regulated in cops-1/ <dig>  cops-3/ <dig>  and cons-3/ <dig> bovine groups




in pathways associated with the response of the mammary gland secretory tissues to the bacteria, approximately  <dig> to  <dig> degs were found, making the detected paths highly significant . figure  <dig> shows an example diagram of the signaling pathway of a toll-like receptor together with the selected degs comparing the cops-3/ <dig> vs. h groups. the figure shows the dependence of the complement cascade and cytokine pathways on the toll-like receptor pathway. degs in the cops-3/ <dig> vs. h comparison were involved in metabolic reactions leading to complement and cytokine pathways.fig.  <dig> gene map of the signaling pathways of the toll-like receptor, activation of complement and interaction of cytokines  derived from the kegg database. genes showing significantly different expression in the cops-3/ <dig> vs. h groups are marked with red asterisks. the figure shows the dependence of complement activation and cytokine pathways on the toll-like receptor pathway . differentially expressed genes are located on the paths leading to the complement and cytokine pathways




in the cops-1/ <dig> group, intestinal immune network for iga  production, gap junction, and hematopoietic cell lineage pathways were involved in the immune response to infection. in the cops-3/ <dig> group, genes associated with the lysosome, t cell receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, and cytosolic dna-sensing pathways were differentially expressed as compared to the h group.

identification of functional gene clusters
bioinformatics analysis of microarray results showed that the identified degs were involved in multiple biological processes. clustering analysis using the david functional clustering module allowed for a more accurate classification and interpretation of results. several clusters were identified in each of the transcriptomes. functional clustering showed that identified clusters were primarily associated with immunological processes . analysis of samples collected from cows assigned to the groups cops-1/ <dig>  cops-3/ <dig>  cons-1/ <dig>  and cons-3/ <dig> showed six, eight, four, and five clusters, respectively. these clusters contained groups of genes associated with the immune response, antigen presentation, mhc proteins, chemotaxis of leukocytes, leukocyte adhesion, activity of chemokines and cytokines, complement activation, humoral response, b-cell activity, and activity of immunoglobulins. furthermore, in samples taken from the cops-3/ <dig> group, a cluster no.  <dig>  consisting of genes associated with metabolism and biosynthesis of lipids and fatty acid was identified. in samples derived from the cons-1/ <dig> animals, three additional clusters were identified and were associated with the serine-threonine kinase receptor signaling pathway, transforming growth factor beta , and a cluster of genes related to the organization of cytoskeletal actin.

validation of selected genes by real-time quantitative pcr 
validation of microarray results was performed to confirm the accuracy of the transcriptomic analysis for each of the four comparisons using individual, unpooled mrna samples. the relative transcript levels of validated genes were compared between infected and non-infected samples within age groups separately . in concordance with the microarray results, the levels of saa <dig> , cfb , and cp  were higher in both cops and both cons group samples. moreover, comparisons between cops-1/ <dig> and h-1/ <dig> groups and cops-3/ <dig> and h-3/ <dig> groups revealed that, in both cops groups, hp  and il <dig>  gene transcripts were higher than in h groups, while the levels of ca <dig>  and ca <dig>  were higher in h-1/ <dig> and h-3/ <dig> groups, respectively. in the cons-3/ <dig> group, hp gene expression was higher than in h-3/ <dig> group, similar to both cops groups. patterns of gene expression in cow mammary parenchyma, as measured with real-time pcr  between particular groups  according to lactation status, are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> validation of microarray analysis using real-time pcr. the relative levels of mrna expressed are shown as the mean  of six animals. groups differ from each other significantly at *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , and ***p <  <dig> 




discussion
in the present study, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed in the parenchyma derived from infected cows’ mammary glands as compared to healthy ones. the highest number of degs,  <dig> genes, was identified in cops-3/ <dig> group. the infection caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci  influenced a smaller number of genes in this age group –  <dig>  cows in lactations 1/ <dig> were also characterized by different gene expression profiles; the numbers of degs were  <dig> and  <dig> in the cops and cons groups, respectively. these results reflected the complex nature of the mammary tissue response to infection with staphylococcus bacteria. the intricacy and complexity of gene expression patterns associated with s. aureus infections, both in blood leukocytes and milk somatic cells , were emphasized by other researchers  <cit> . moreover, the inflammation of mammary glands of other species, such as goat or pig exposed either to mycoplasma agalactiae  or to e. coli and s. aureus , also resulted in many differentially expressed genes in the early response  to infection  <cit> .

functional classification of genes
classifying degs according to their ontology, and so grouping them into similar categories in terms of gene function, identified a number of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components primarily involved in the immune response. in young cows infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci , increased expression levels of cfb, cfh, and c4bp were found, encoding complement system factors b and h as well as c4b-binding protein, respectively. in humans, these factors are an important part of the complement system acting against microbial infections  <cit>  similar results to ours were obtained by rinaldi et al.  <cit>  and whelehan et al.  <cit> . these authors reported increased expression of acute phase proteins in mammary tissues infected with e. coli compared to bacteria free-tissues. furthermore, the results of whelehan et al.  <cit>  showed elevated levels of saa <dig> gene transcripts  in the udder parenchyma of cows infected with s. aureus. in the present study, in cops-3/ <dig> and cons-3/ <dig> groups, as well as in cops-1/ <dig> group, higher expression levels of genes encoding proteins of the canonical pathway of complement activation complex  and the alternative route of the complement system  were observed. this is an interesting observation as the complement system is an example of cooperation between specific and non-specific immune mechanisms  <cit> . activation of the complement pathway is important for a rapid response against pathogens, before an organism is able to develop specific mechanisms that operate slowly but more effectively. numerous studies have reported activation by s. aureus of both alternative and classical complement pathways  <cit> , which is consistent with our results showing the activation of genes encoding proteins belonging to both pathways of complement action. most of these genes, however, belong to the classical complement pathway, which could be due to the recurrent udder inflammation in the examined cows, resulting in production of specific antibodies activating the classical complement pathway. two pathways of complement activation do not operate completely independently. the c3b component, generated by the classical pathway, can be deposited on the cell surface and thus may further initiate the formation of the alternative pathway. in the cons-1/ <dig> group, the immune response to the pathogen relies on the activation of the alternative complement pathway. this may indicate that the organism of a young animal is able to combat infection without the activation of specific immune mechanisms, or that it meets with this certain type of bacteria for the first time.

in cops-1/ <dig>  cops-3/ <dig>  and cons-3/ <dig> groups, four degs were identified with increased expression associated with antigen processing and presentation - bola-dqb, bola-drb <dig>  bola-dqa <dig>  and bola-dqa <dig>  these genes and the encoded proteins are critical for the immune system to clear infections  <cit> . most studies confirm the paramount importance of class i and class ii mhc molecules, which are key in resistance to infection not only in human  <cit>  but also in goat and bovine, including resistance to mastitis . fitzpatrick et al.  <cit>  showed mhc-ii up-regulation in the connective tissue derived from s. uberis bacteria-infected cow udders. swanson et al.  <cit>  also reported a higher hla-dra  gene expression in the mammary tissues of cows after intramammary infection with s. uberis but not in healthy tissues. moreover, brand et al.,  <cit>  listed several genes belonging to the major histocompatibility complex  as a part of a “dendritic cell maturation” canonical pathway, which was affected by mastitic bacteria. according to bonnefont et al.  <cit> , the subunits of mhc class ii, namely dqa <dig>  dqa <dig>  and drb <dig>  were also affected by s. aureus.

biochemical pathways
two biochemical pathways were involved in the bovine immune response to infection with staphylococcus bacteria: the toll-like receptors pathway and the cytokine receptor interaction pathway. tlrs are membrane receptors that play a key role in the innate immune system, recognizing structurally conserved molecules derived from different microorganisms. cells of the immune system which recognize the molecular patterns of a pathogen with tlrs, include macrophages and dendritic cells that respond to membrane components of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . stimulation of these cells by a pathogen through tlrs induces rapid activation of the innate immune mechanisms, manifested by increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of dendritic cells  <cit> . toll-like receptors are located on the surface of macrophages, whose activation leads to the synthesis of tnf and il- <dig>  <cit> . in our study, in the signaling pathway of toll-like receptors, genes such as tnf, il- <dig>  cxcl <dig> ), and cd <dig>  have been identified. this observation confirmed the results of other authors who have shown increased expression of tnf, il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cd <dig> antigen genes in tissues of cow udders experimentally infected with e. coli and s. aureus  <cit> . moreover, bonnefont et al.  <cit>  stressed that the components of the chemokine signaling pathway are affected by s. aureus infection. the proteins encoded by tnf, il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cd <dig> genes  are closely related to inflammation and are essential for the activation of neutrophils and their migration to sites of inflammation in the infected mammary gland. on the basis of our study, it can be concluded that bacterial infections by coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci evoke similar reactions in the innate immune system. this was also evidenced by the fact that the toll-like receptors pathway leads to the activation of the next two pathways, which are also shared by both bacterial infections . one is the complement activation pathway, which involves the genes discussed above in relation to the process of acute inflammation. another biochemical pathway involved in mammary gland response to bacterial pathogens is the cytokine receptor interaction pathway. in our study, in all groups of cows infected with staphylococci bacteria, a higher level of expression was found for genes encoding chemokine receptors cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  and cx3cr <dig>  as compared to the healthy groups of cows. günther at el.  <cit> , in a study on the secretory epithelial cells of bovine mammary glands infected with e. coli, showed an important role of the fractalkine receptor and other cxc receptors in the recruitment and migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation. additionally, results of studies on goat and porcine mammary gland epithelial cells also indicated on the influence of the infection on cytokine and chemokine expression levels  <cit> .

functional gene networks
comparing cops-1/ <dig> cows with controls, we identified a network of differentially expressed genes responsible for the migration of immune cells. in this network, cd <dig>  plau, and mmp <dig> genes can be distinguished, and they are strongly linked to other genes of the determined network. the cd <dig> gene encodes a glycoprotein, the hyaluronain receptor, which is an important component of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . the interaction of cd <dig> with the glycoprotein hyaluronate  has an important role in the adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium, as well as their migration to the sites of inflammation  <cit> . the results of more recent studies showed elevated cd <dig> expression in inflammation of the cow mammary gland, particularly in the early stages of the inflammatory response  <cit> . the increased expression of cd <dig> found in our study in a group of younger individuals  may be indicative of the acute inflammation and tissue damage.

the plau gene encodes the urokinase plasminogen activator, which is a part of the fibrinolytic system. plau is a protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin by specific cleavage of the plasminogen protein  <cit> . the results of studies conducted by lincoln and leigh  <cit>  and moyes et al.  <cit>  on a group of dairy cows infected with s. uberis also showed induction of the plau gene. the authors interpreted this result as an indicator of s. uberis virulence, causing inflammation of the mammary gland of cows. plasmin catalyzes the degradation of fibrin and laminin to soluble peptides. its activity is connected with elevated permeability of the epithelial barrier in the mammary gland during inflammation. the other function of plasmin is activation of mmp precursors  <cit> . disintegration of these proteins is carried out either by direct action of plasmin, or indirectly through its activating effect on the mmp precursor cascade  <cit> . this corresponds to the results of our study, which also demonstrated the activation of the mmp <dig> metalloproteinase gene, undergoing higher expression in the cows from the cops-1/ <dig> group than in controls. increased expression of the mmp <dig> gene may result in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation.

in cons-3/ <dig> and cops-3/ <dig> groups, four and five significant intergenic networks were identified, respectively, which could be ascribed to two common key gene nodes: tnf and fos. furthermore, when comparing cops-1/ <dig> cows with healthy ones, the il1-β node  gene was identified. it exhibited, inseparably with tnf, activity in inflammation  <cit> . the tnf, il1-β, and fos genes belong to the toll-like receptor and cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways, and they were also identified in the cops-3/ <dig> experimental group. the fos gene encodes a transcription factor that is a component of the jun/ap- <dig> trans-activating complex. in the basic state of a cell, fos has a very low level of expression, but its transcript level increases within several minutes after stimulation by s. uberis; therefore, this gene is called “the early response gene”  <cit> . it is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation  <cit> . lützow et al.  <cit> , after challenging bovine mammary tissues with s. aureus, showed increased expression of the fos gene, which is involved in the tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig> signaling pathway. in the studies of s. uberis infection, the fos gene was shown to be a component of il- <dig> and il- <dig> signaling pathways  <cit> .

ap <dig> has been reported play a crucial role in signaling pathways related to bacterial infections  <cit> . functional ap <dig> sites have been identified in promoters of cytokine  encoding genes  and other genes participating in the immune response. the c-jun nh-terminal kinase  regulates ap <dig> transcription factor activity and stimulates expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tnf  <cit> . the increased expression of the fos gene found in our study indicated a strong stress caused by infection with coagulase-negative and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

the il1b gene encodes a protein that is a member of the cytokine – interleukin-1β family. this protein is produced by monocytes/macrophages and epithelial cells  <cit> , whereas the tnf-α and tnf-β genes encode multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokines that belong to the family of tumor necrosis factors   <cit> . tnf-α plays an important role in the lactating cow’s mammary gland by mediating immune inflammatory responses in mastitis  <cit> . tnf mediates most pro-inflamatory effects that occur upon bacterial infection by promoting nfkb and mapk activation  <cit> . our identification of the proinflammatory cytokine genes as nodal  genes indicates their important role in the immune response induced by the two groups of bacteria studied . these results confirm those found in the literature, as the tnf-β and il- <dig> cytokines were previously identified as the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in inflammation. they are also critical in inflammation of the mammary gland of cows caused by s. aureus and e. coli  <cit> . as shown by xiu et al.  <cit>  other cytokines , including chemokines  were upregulated after infection caused by s. aureus.

CONCLUSIONS
infection of cow mammary gland parenchyma with coagulase-negative or -positive staphylococci affected genes, which encode proteins showing the same and/or similar molecular functions. our results provided evidence that coagulase-positive staphylococci caused a much stronger host response than coagulase-negative, resulting in increased number of degs as compared with uninfected tissues. moreover, the response of the udder parenchyma to a staphyllococci infection was stronger in older cows  than was observed in younger ones . gene network analysis predicted degs associated with inflammation, cell migration, and the immune response to the infection site, as well as a humoral response in infections caused by both coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative groups of staphylococci.

in both types of infections, caused either by coagulase-positive or coagulase-negative staphylococci, a marked increase was observed in the expression levels of fos and tnf genes, and genes encoding the major histocompatibility system proteins -bola-dqb, bola-drb <dig>  or bola-dqa <dig>  therefore, we suggest that these particular genes play a key role in immune response synchronization of the cow’s udder secretory tissues to mastitis-causing bacteria.

based on the results of microarray study, the following genes belonging to several physiological pathways  were selected for further studies: chemokine signaling pathway , cell adhesion molecules  pathway , antigen processing and presentation pathway , and nod-like receptor signaling pathway . the listed genes are considered “main genes” involved in mammary gland defense, and these gene polymorphism study has already started to find the associations with resistance to mastitis aiming to include results to mas in the future. moreover, epigenetic studies have been conducted in parallel.
