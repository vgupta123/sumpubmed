BACKGROUND
microglia are the prime immune effector cells of the central nervous system . the origin, morphology and role of microglia in health and disease were first elaborately described in  <dig>  <cit> . the amoeboid microglial cells , which are abundant in the periventricular white matter, namely the corpus callosum  of the brain function as macrophages in the developing brain. studies have demonstrated that amc gradually transform into ramified microglial cells  with advancing age  <cit> .

the time course of development of microglia differs in different regions of the brain  <cit> . in the cc, amc preponderate a week before birth in mice and rats  <cit>  and actively phagocytose the cellular debris and refine axonal connectivity during the first postnatal week  <cit> . this is followed by the gradual transition into rmc, which survey the brain parenchyma with their fine and non-overlapping ramifications, thereby monitoring chronic and acute insults  <cit> . upon activation by trauma, infection or any other neurodegenerative stimuli, microglia retract their ramifications, transform into amoeboid or spherical shape, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and display phagocytosis  <cit> . these microglia are known to be activated or reactive.

studies in chronic, aging associated neuropathologies such as alzheimer’s disease   <cit> , and parkinson’s disease   <cit>  indicate persistent microglial activation as the major causative factor in disease exacerbation. aging brains are often characterized by the presence of primed microglia, which present an altered cytokine profile in comparison to their counterparts in younger brains  <cit> . these microglia produce an exaggerated inflammatory response when activated  <cit>  leading to prolonged cycles of proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which eventually render them neurotoxic. further, chronic microglial activation has been shown to cause the impairment of adult neurogenesis in hippocampus  <cit>  and damage to the periventricular white matter  in the early postnatal brain  <cit> . hence activated microglia in both postnatal and adult stages can have neurotoxic effects on the cns by causing excessive inflammation. identification of ways to attenuate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, therefore, has been the primary consideration in therapeutic strategy. there is accumulated information on the factors that contribute to the activation, migration, proliferation and immune response of microglia over the years  <cit> , but the gene expression and signaling networks that function within these cells are yet to be fully clarified.

gene expression profiles of microglia from primary cultures are available, but their expression profiles have been found to be altered once isolated from their natural milieu  <cit> . it is striking that investigation on the expression profiles of functioning genes of amc and rmc in vivo in their quiescent state have remained elusive. in this connection, we carried out a global gene expression profiling of amc and rmc in situ by isolating them from the cc of rat brain using laser-capture microdissection  tool. overlapping the transcriptome onto several online and commercial databases, our current study aimed to identify molecular candidates that are associated with the morphological transformation and physiological functioning of microglia in the developing brain. further, we have identified the genes that render ‘stemness’ and ‘monocytic’ functions to amc and rmc. the transcriptome profiling has also led to the identification of several genes that may be vital in regulating microglial proliferation, differentiation, migration, and ramification.

methods
ethics statement
in the handling and care of animals, the international guiding principles for animals research, as adopted by the institutional animal care and use committee , national university of singapore, were followed. all efforts were made to minimize pain and the number of rats used.

laser-capture microdissection 
whole fresh brains were removed from 5-day postnatal wistar rat pups  and 4-week old wistar rats  and placed in liquid nitrogen immediately for a short time and then frozen in a cryostat . the forebrain was sectioned coronally through the cc at 5 μm thickness and mounted on precleaned slides. the sections were fixed in 75% ethanol for 1 min and incubated with peroxidase conjugated isolectin  for 15 min. the sections were then dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol and cleaned in xylene. the slide was placed on the microscope stage of mmi cellcut . the  <dig> x,  <dig> x to  <dig> x objective lenses were used to achieve the proper placement of the cap  above the cc. lectin stained microglia cells  were selected and cut by laser and collected into the cap of tube . extra care was taken to minimize the contamination of materials from other cell types while laser dissecting microglia from the cc.

microarray analysis
total rna was extracted from  <dig> isolated microglia cells per group using rneasy micro kit , quantified by nanodrop  <dig>  and hybridized to each microarray chip. rna  was reverse transcripted into the first-strand cdna using a t7-oligo  primer . after second-strand cdna synthesis, the double-stranded cdna was purified and served as a template in the first cycle of in vitro transcription  reaction. the unlabeled crna was then reverse transcripted into the first-strand cdna of the second cycle using random primers. subsequently, the t7-oligo promoter primer was used in the second-strand cdna synthesis to generate double-stranded cdna template containing t <dig> promoter sequences. then the double-stranded cdna was amplified and labeled using a biotinylated nucleotide analog/ribonucleotide mix in the second ivt reaction. the labeled crna was then cleaned up, fragmented, and hybridized to rat genome  <dig>  <dig>  array . a total of six arrays  were carried out in the present study. the arrays were stained according to the manufacturer’s protocols and then scanned with the genechip scanner . initial analysis of the scanned images was performed by genechip operating software . for absolute analysis, each chip was normalized to a target intensity of  <dig>  and probe sets were assigned a signal intensity and detection call of present, marginal or absent.

data analysis and generation of gene lists
the absolute data  were exported into genespring gx  <dig>  software . all the six chips were globally normalized and the genes of over 2-fold differential expression were filtered out and used for functional analysis.

data normalization and generation of gene lists using matlab
raw cel files of the six chips were rma  normalized using the affymetrix expression console version  <dig>  . the normalized data was then used to identify differentially expressed genes between amc and rmc in matlab r2009a . for the statistical analysis, we used the ‘exploring gene expression data’ demo scripts in the bioinformatics toolbox™. the data was filtered for removing genes with low expression values and low variance across chips. further, t-test was performed to retain genes with p-values less than  <dig>  and a volcano plot was generated to identify the two-fold differentially expressed genes. the microarray data discussed in this publication is miame compliant and has been deposited in ncbis gene expression omnibus . it is accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> 

gene expression profile clustering and pathway analysis
agglomerative average-linkage hierarchical clustering of the different experimental groups was obtained for selected groups of genes with genespring gx  <dig>  software  with standard correlation used as the similarity matrix. the gene lists obtained was fed into pathway studio  <dig> software  to generate pathways for identifying interactions between the genes for validation purposes.

analysis of gene lists
the gene list generated from matlab was used to identify functional groups enriched in the amc and rmc using david bioinformatics database  <cit> . to identify the ‘stemness’ of amc and rmc, we compared our gene lists to gene lists enriched in embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . since the data were accumulated from a different microarray platform, we found orthologs to their genes pertaining to our platform using the online netaffyx application . for comparison of our gene expression data to that of peripheral blood monocytes  <cit> , the raw cel files of monocyte expression data were downloaded from ncbi geo  and the orthologs pertaining to our platform were identified using the online netaffyx application. these files were rma normalized in affymetrix expression console version  <dig>   and subsequently the average expression values of the monocyte genes were compared to our microglia gene lists.

double immunofluorescence staining on postnatal rat brain sections
5-day and 4-week old wistar rat pups were purchased from the laboratory animal centre, national university of singapore. the animals were perfused and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for further procedure. for double immunofluorescence staining, forebrain sections at 30μm were cut through the corpus callosum using cryostat . the sections were incubated with purified mouse anti-ox- <dig> ig  along with rabbit anti-eto  or with rabbit anti-dcx  or with rabbit anti-sox <dig>  or with rabbit anti-sox <dig>  or with rabbit anti-sept <dig>  with rabbit anti-sept <dig>  overnight at 4°c. on the following day, the sections were further incubated with either fitc-conjugated goat-anti-mouse igg  or cy3-conjugated sheep-anti-rabbit igg secondary antibody . the sections were counterstained with dapi  and mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium . photo-images were captured using a confocal microscope .

cell culture
bv- <dig> cells  were maintained at 75 cm <dig> culture flasks in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  and cultured in 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig> and 95% air incubator. cells were seeded on 6-well plates at about a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> per well for rna isolation.

rna isolation and real-time rt-pcr for validation of microarray data
total rna from laser-captured amc and rmc was extracted using mirneasy mini kit  and rna from bv- <dig> cells was extracted with rneasy mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quantified spectrophotometrically. 2 μg of rna from each sample was added to a total volume of 25 μl reaction mixture containing  <dig>  μm of oligo  primer , and 200u of molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase . the reaction was initiated by incubating the reaction mixture for 1 h at 42°c for reverse transcription, and stopped by heating for 10 min at 70°c. aliquot  of the each reverse transcription product was added to the 10 μl reaction mixture containing quantitectrsybrr green i,  <dig>  μm of each primer corresponding to runx1t <dig>  sept <dig>  sept <dig>  mbp , gapdh, dcx, mbp , or β-actin and 4 mm mgcl <dig> to amplify the genes in abi 7900ht fast pcr system . the primer sequences of runx1t <dig> are forward: 5′-acgaacagctgcttctggat-3′and reverse: 5′-tgcttggatgttctgagtgc-3′, sept  <dig> are forward: 5′-aaccatgtccctcgaacttg-3′ and reverse: 5′-aagagagaggggacacgaca-3′, sept  <dig> are forward: 5′-ctcatccgggagaaagatga-3′ and everse: 5′-gagctgatgcagggaag-3′, mbp are forward: 5′-tacttggccacagcaagtacc-3′ and reverse: 5′-gggtgtacgaggtgtcacaat-3′, gapdh are forward: 5′-acatgccgcctggagaaacctgcca-3′ and reverse: 5′-tgccagccccagcatcaaaggtgga-3′. the primer sequences used for the data reported in the supplementary figure are listed in additional file 1: sheet s <dig>  after pre-incubation at 95°c for 15 min, the polymerase chain reaction  was performed as follows:  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 15 s, annealing at 57°c for 25 s, and elongation at 72°c for 15 s.

RESULTS
laser-capture microdissection of microglial cells from the corpus callosum of 5-day and 4-week old rat brain.

to compare the gene expression profiles of amc and rmc, we stained both microglial cell types with peroxidase-conjugated lectin and isolated them from the cc of 5-day and 4-week old rat brain respectively. lcm of amc and rmc from the cc of 5-day old rat brain has been shown in figure1a-f. lectin staining has been widely used to selectively stain microglia for study of microglial development in the cns  <cit> . the cells isolated by lcm were further confirmed to be microglia since the mrna expression of oligodendrocyte , astrocyte  and endothelial cell-specific genes  was undetectable .

cdna microarray and generation of gene lists specific to amc and rmc
to identify the genes that are differentially expressed between amc and rmc, we extracted total rna from amc and rmc and carried out cdna microarray using rat genome  <dig>  <dig>  array . each sample contained rna from six hundred laser-captured microglial cells. to ensure gene expression consistency between samples within the groups, we determined the pearson’s rank correlation coefficient after normalizing the raw expression data . the gene expression profile from the samples of same group showed a very high correlation of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  while, a relatively lower correlation value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  was observed between samples of different groups. a high correlation coefficient of above  <dig>  between the amc and rmc may be due to the fact that the comparison is between the gene expression profiles of the same cell type., i.e. microglia regardless of the differences in age  and morphology .

agglomerative average-linked hierarchical clustering was performed and genes showing over two-fold differential expression between amc and rmc were identified using genespring  <dig>  . about  <dig> genes were found to be differentially regulated in the two sample groups -  <dig> with upregulation and  <dig> with downregulation in amc. a high number of differentially expressed genes identified were either novel or did not have any functional annotation. in view of this, a list of genes with known functional annotations was generated using the statistical functions in the bioinformatics toolbox in matlab r2009a  <cit> . this list was generated using a less stringent filtering  and contained close to  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes in amc compared to rmc .

functional categorization of amc and rmc
the genes with highest fold change values in amc and rmc  clearly delineate their functions and residing environment. for example, the amc express genes that are shown to be involved in nervous system development   <cit> , immune system development   <cit> , cell migration during neurodevelopment   <cit>  and the immune response as well in migration of microglia   <cit> . the finding of expression of some genes that are known to be neuron-specific , is interesting and has been further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis which revealed the expression of dcx by the amc in the cc of 5 day old rat brain . in addition, mrna expression of dcx was detected in the bv- <dig> microglia  by rtpcr .

interestingly, the rmc express genes involved in myelination . mbp-like proteins, also known as golli proteins have previously been shown to be localized in human microglia at 22 weeks postnatally  <cit> . mbp mrna was found to be expressed by laser captured-rmc  and bv- <dig> microglia . other myelin-related genes like plp <dig>  <cit>  and lgi <dig>  <cit>  have also been found with high expression values in the rmc. plp <dig> and lgi <dig> were found to be expressed by non-myelinating cells such as the bergmann glia in cerebellum of the developing mouse brain  <cit> .

on sorting the genes based on p values , we found several genes that are specific to amc such as, genes involved in transcriptional repression   <cit> , vesicular trafficking   <cit> , and microtubule depolymerization   <cit> . rmc express genes involved in immune functions such as rt1-a <dig>  which is the mhc of rat and c1ql <dig>  a protein of the complement system  <cit> , calcium ion signaling pathway protein, camk <dig>  <cit>  and sodium dependent glucose transporter gene slc5a <dig>  known to interact with immune-related genes  <cit> .

functional clusters of genes specific to amc and rmc were derived using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig> . the functional groups in amc involved cell cycle, mrna processing, ribosome activity, cytoskeleton, and migration  and those in rmc were cellular homeostasis, cell projection, glial cell development, axon ensheathment, and regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity .

it has been observed that in amc, genes which are involved in cell proliferation, death, and differentiation are highly expressed, whereas in rmc, genes that are mainly involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell differentiation are highly expressed .

expression of monocyte-specific genes by amc and rmc
microglia have been proposed to originate from two distinct sources: the mesenchymal progenitor cells at the yolk sac  <cit>  and bone-marrow derived circulating monocytes  <cit> . the availability of gene expression profiles for circulating monocytes prompted us to compare and study the functional similarities of amc and rmc to that of circulating monocytes  <cit>  . monocytic genes highly expressed by amc  are known to be involved in several disease pathways such as parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease and hiv infection, phagocytosis and chemokine signaling pathways. further, the monocytic genes  expressed by rmc are involved in antigen presentation and lysosome-related functions. the peripheral monocytic genes expressed by the amc and rmc may be further investigated if they reflect the microglia property in pathological brain. these genes may also provide deeper insights into the similarities between peripheral monocytes and microglia and the re-appearance of these genes during infection or neurodegeneration in the activated microglia may be critical for immune response.

expression of neural, embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell specific genes by amc and rmc
both amc and rmc express a number of stem cell specific genes  <cit>  . however, the rmc express a lesser number of neural stem cell  and embryonic stem cell  specific genes, compared with the amc. in spite of this, higher percentage of hematopoietic stem cell specific genes  was found to be expressed in rmc . our finding that microglia retain hsc specific properties even in the adult brain is suggestive of their hematopoietic lineage.

pathway analysis and validation of differentially expressed genes in amc and rmc
the pathway analysis  revealed novel molecular networks involving several signaling molecules and pathways within microglia. in order to validate the results obtained from pathway analysis, we randomly selected three transcription factors which are highly expressed in the amc. they are: sox <dig> and sox <dig> which are sry-related hmg-box family of transcription factors  <cit>  and runt-related transcription factor 1; translocated to,  <dig>  , a member of the eto gene family of transcriptional co-repressors  <cit> .

runx1t <dig>  by forming a fusion protein with runx <dig>  another member of runx family, leads to self-renewal of human monocytic cells thereby impairing differentiation of these cells  <cit> . certain genes known to be downregulated by the runx1-runx1t <dig> transcription factor complex such as socs <dig>  csf <dig>  and runx <dig> are highly expressed by rmc  <cit>  . further, a transcriptional dysregulation caused by this fusion protein was found to cause the over-expression of sox <dig> in human progenitor cells  <cit> . in an earlier study, sox <dig> deficient mice exhibited proliferation-defective pro-b cells  <cit> . similar networks might function in the amc and therefore warrants further investigation. our immunohistochemical analysis revealed that sox <dig>  is highly expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of amc. similarly, sox <dig>  and runx1t <dig>  are expressed in the amc, but hardly detectable in the rmc thus validating our microarray results. further, quantitative real time rtpcr for runx1t <dig> using rna extracted from lcm-captured amc and rmc showed a very high expression of runx1t <dig> in amc when compared to rmc .

differential expression of septin genes in amc and rmc
septins are a family of multifunctional proteins involved in cytoskeletal organisation and cell division  <cit> . they have also been implicated in tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration  <cit> . in the present study, septin genes were found to be differentially expressed in amc and rmc. sept <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed in amc whereas sept <dig> and  <dig> expressed in rmc. the expression of some of these genes was further confirmed by immunohistochemical and quantitative real time rtpcr analysis which showed sept <dig> immunoexpression and mrna expression in the amc  and sept <dig> expression in the rmc . since the role of septins in microglial functioning has not yet been investigated, studies on the septin family may further our knowledge on the cytoskeletal dynamics involved in proliferation, migration and activation of amc and rmc.

microglia in response to trauma or neurodegenerative stimuli exhibit upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . in the present study, both amc and rmc exhibited relatively low expression intensities for most of the cytokines such as tnf-α and interleukins and chemokines such as cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> .

discussion
microglia in the healthy brain express low levels of cytokines and chemokines
this study is a novel attempt to examine the global gene expression profile of microglia in situ and to functionally distinguish the two distinct microglial phenotypes, namely, amc and rmc. a noteworthy feature of this transcriptome profile was that the expression of cytokines and chemokines in both amc and rmc was hardly detectable which is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . it has been widely shown that the untreated microglia in culture produce some amount of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, indicating that culture media stimulate the microglial cells. significantly, the low expression of cytokines and chemokines in both types of microglia in the present study appears to mimic the transcriptome status of normal microglia in healthy brain in vivo.

amc express genes involved in cell cycle process and migration whereas rmc express genes involved in synaptic integrity and neuronal maturation
amc from the first week of postnatal rat brains have a high proliferative capacity  <cit> . during development, about two-thirds of amc undergo apoptosis and the rest transform into rmc  <cit> . in accordance with this, microarray analysis in the present study revealed a high expression of cell proliferation/cell cycle-related genes such as myc and cyclina <dig>  cyclinb <dig> and cyclind <dig>   <cit>  and genes involved in cell death  namely, casp <dig> casp <dig>  <cit>  and apaf <dig> in the amc  <cit> . it is striking that the amc express dcx, a protein known to be a marker for migrating neurons  <cit> . it may be worth investigating the role of dcx in migration of amc in the early postnatal brain.

on the other hand, the rmc, apart from cell homeostasis and glial development, appear to contribute to synaptic transmission as they express genes such as grin2c, s100b and camk2a   <cit> . this is interesting and supports the recent experimental studies showing the role of microglia in the maintenance and modifications of synaptic integrity in the healthy brain  <cit> . further, grin2c, a subunit of nmda receptor complex is expressed by the microglial cells in the cc and has been shown to be functionally important in microglia-mediated neuroinflammation  <cit> . s100b, a calcium ion binding protein, is also expressed by microglia and relocates around phagosomes during microglial activation and phagocytosis  <cit> .

rmc express myelin basic protein  which encodes two families of proteins i.e., classic mbps and golli-mbps. classic mbps serve as the major protein constituent of myelin in the central and peripheral nervous system whereas, the golli proteins are known to be broadly distributed in the brain, particularly in the microglia during normal development and inflammation  <cit>  and involved in the interaction between microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells during multiple sclerosis  <cit> . taken together, these results reveal that microglia are not only involved in immune response and phagocytosis but also play diverse roles in healthy brain.

both amc and rmc express cytoskeleton-related genes
regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics is important to both microglial migration and ramification  <cit> . apart from cytoskeletal structural proteins such as tubulins and actin, we found that the amc express cytoskeleton-associated crmp family proteins  <cit>  such as crmp- <dig>  dpysl <dig> and dpysl <dig> and septin family proteins such as sept <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . septins are implicated in cytoskeletal processes such as vesicular trafficking  <cit> . these cytoskeleton-associated proteins may therefore explain the migration and phagocytosis of amc during normal development and pathology. in the present study, amc express sept <dig> but not sept <dig> whereas, rmc express sept <dig>  but not sept <dig>  indicating differential roles of septin family genes in amc and rmc. sept <dig> has been recently shown to be involved in cortical neuron migration  <cit> . absence of sept <dig> immunoexpression in the amc and its high expression in the rmc is suggestive of an important role for this protein in microglial transformation during development.

expression of monocyte- and stem cell-specific genes by amc and rmc indicates their stemness and origin
recent studies have proven that microglia originate from the mesenchymal progenitor cells at the yolk sac  <cit> . however, microarray studies of various hematopoetic and non-hematopoetic cell types revealed a close relationship between the gene expression profiles of microglia and bone-marrow derived macrophages  <cit>  which are known to differentiate from circulating monocytes. therefore, we sought to identify the monocyte-specific genes expressed by amc and rmc. amc express several monocyte-specific genes including mcl <dig> and id <dig>  mcl <dig> is associated with cell viability and differentiation of myeloid cells which include monocytes and macrophages  <cit>  and id <dig>  a negative regulator of basic helix loop helix transcription factors, is involved in the differentiation of myeloid cells  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that id <dig> is required for bone morphogenic protein -mediated differentiation of microglia into map2+ neurons and gfap+ astrocytes  <cit>  suggesting that this gene may promote microglial trans-differentiation. both mcl <dig> and id <dig> have been shown to be involved in cell differentiation and their high expression in amc explains the role of these genes in promoting the maturation of amc and its transformation into rmc

on the other hand, rmc exhibited increased expression of lsp <dig>  which binds to the cytoskeleton and is known to be a marker for leucocytes  <cit> . overexpression of lsp <dig> in neutrophils was associated to defective actin polymerization which render these cells immotile  <cit> . further, overexpression of lsp <dig> in a highly motile melanoma cell line led to formation of hair-like projections. thus, upregulation of lsp <dig> in the rmc, compared to the amc may explain the role of this gene in motility and ramification of rmc  <cit>  which are the resident population in the adult brain parenchyma.

both amc and rmc express stem cell-specific  genes, indicating their stemness and suggesting that microglia may undergo trans-differentiation. the rmc expressed a high percentage of hsc specific genes in comparison to esc and nsc specific genes, and this, reinforces the monocytic nature of microglia. for example mll <dig>  a highly expressed hsc specific gene in the rmc, is a histone methyl transferase whose functional disruption is implicated in human leukemia  <cit> . understanding the functions of these hsc specific genes may be important in comprehending the immune system related-roles of amc and rmc.

amc express proliferation- and differentiation-related genes, sox <dig>  sox <dig> and runx1t1
in order to validate the microarray data, we have analyzed the expression patterns of sox genes  which are known to be involved in differentiation and runx1t <dig>  which is involved in the proliferation of hematopoietic lineage cells. these genes were highly expressed by the amc and their expression and role have not been studied in microglia, so far. initially, nuclear expression of the transcription factor sox <dig> was shown to be associated with embryonic neurogenesis and lymphopoiesis  <cit> . however, there are no data on the role of sox genes in microglia in which sox <dig> is expressed in the cytoplasm as reported in plasma myeloma cells and other b-cell lymphomas  <cit> . according to previous studies, the overexpression of the fusion protein, runx1-runx1t <dig> causes the downregulation of csf- <dig>   <cit>  and runx <dig>   <cit> . our expression profile showed the increased expression of runx1t <dig> in the amc and downregulation of csf- <dig> and runx <dig> in amc compared to rmc. functional analysis of these transcription factors may help in understanding microglial proliferation and differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the transcriptome profiling has identified several genes, which help in elucidating morphological transformation and functions of amc and rmc. these genes not only represent the physiological role of microglia in the developing brain but may also be useful therapeutic targets in neuropathologies in which microglia are implicated.
