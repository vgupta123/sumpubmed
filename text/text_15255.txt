BACKGROUND
grass carp  is one of the most important freshwater fish, with fast growth, low cost of breeding, and delicious meat. it is widely distributed in china's major river systems. grass carp is a farmed species that is easily affected by diseases induced by viruses and bacteria; this can cause tremendous economic losses. to date, no excellent breeding varieties have been obtained by the oriented cultivation technique. because of the long breeding cycle , a hybrid breeding strategy is not feasible. further, because of the lack of understanding of the genetic background of grass carp, no molecular breeding technology has been applied. the discovery of economically important trait-related genes and their functional study may help to establish a molecular breeding technology system in the fish.

ests  are partial cdna sequences obtained after sequencing the ends of random cdna clones. ests were first used in  <dig> as an effective new method to discover human genes. using est sequences, unknown genomes could be explored at a relatively low cost  <cit> . with the development of dna sequencing technology, the cost of sequencing is becoming lower, and the application of large-scale est sequencing combined with bioinformatics tools for analyzing data is being widely used in different species to find novel genes, for genome annotation, for the identification of gene structure and expression, and in the development of type i molecular markers  <cit> . in fish, large scale est sequencing was used in channel catfish   <cit> , common carp   <cit> , and zebrafish   <cit> .

in recent years, high-throughput data analysis methods have gradually improved and the genomes of many kinds of fishes have been studied. the fishes that have been studied include zebrafish  <cit>  and fugu  <cit> , as model organisms, and the commercial fishes such as atlantic salmon  <cit> , sea bass  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , atlantic halibut  <cit> , bluefin tuna  <cit> , turbot  <cit> , and senegal sole fish  <cit> . in contrast, the molecular biology of grass carp is relatively unknown; currently, there are only  <dig>  grass carp ests in ncbi’s dbest database. most functional genomic research on economically important fish is focused mainly on the development of molecular markers, genetic map construction and gene interval mapping, and other basic data accumulation. research into gene function and its application to breeding is still in the initial stages.

head kidney is an important immune organ in teleost fish; its role is equivalent to mammalian bone marrow  <cit> . head kidney contains a large number of t and b lymphocytes, macrophages and granulocytes that are the basis upon which specific and non-specific immunity is acquired.

in this study, we constructed a non-normalized cdna library for the head kidney of grass carp and obtained  <dig>  unigenes including  <dig> genes of unknown function. we compared the head kidney expression profiles of grass carp infected with grass carp reovirus  with normal controls and obtained  <dig>  differential expressed tags. based on a comparison of the differential expressed tags and potential genes with unknown function in the cdna library, and by identifying gene expression response to gcrv and predicting protein structure, we discovered a novel immune-related gene. this study provides a method for the discovery of novel genes, and reveals the function and the network regulation mechanism of immune-related genes. the results provide a theoretical foundation for molecular design breeding in grass carp.

methods
rna extraction and construction of the cdna library
total rna was extracted from the head kidney of healthy adult grass carp using trizol reagent . the mrna was isolated using the oligotex mrna kit . full length cdna was synthesized by the creatortm smarttm cdna library construction kit  following the method described previously  <cit> . cdna segments longer than 1 kb were isolated by electrophoresis, then ligated into pdnr-lib vector  and used to transform competent e. coli dh5α cells. after growing the colony for  <dig> hours on an lb plate containing chloramphenicol, the cdna library was constructed by selecting mono-clones from the 96-well plate. ethical approval for the work was obtained from expert committee of biomedical ethics, institute of hydrobiology of the chinese academy of sciences. the reference number obtained was y12202-1- <dig> 

dna sequencing and processing of the est sequences
 <dig>  clones were randomly selected from  <dig> 96-well plates. after extracting the recombinant plasmids, 5’ terminal sequencing was performed using the t <dig> universal primer .

an optimal peak chart was obtained by processing the raw sequence data with basecalling. next, fasta format sequences  were obtained by processing the optimal peak chart using the phrap program  <cit>  with the q <dig> standard. we used crossmatch  to remove the pdnr-lib vector sequences and after excluding est sequences that were less than 100 bp long, we obtained a cleaned est data set. clustering of the cleaned ests was performed using uicluster  <cit> . the uicluster sequences were assembled using the phrap program to build a unigene data set for the ests from the head kidney of grass carp.

blast searches, go functional classification and kegg pathway analysis
we used the ncbi blast server  <cit>  to identify sequences that were similar to the sequences in the ncbi nucleotide sequence database , the protein sequence database   <cit>  and the swissprot database  <cit>  using blastn, and blastx  <cit> . using the est sequence with the highest homology as a guide, we set the threshold e-value to e < 1e- <dig> 

we used the blastx search results from the swissprot database and the blast2go tool  <cit>  to assign go functional classification to the unigene sequences. blast2go parameters were set as follows: e-value-hit-filter < 1e-6; annotation cutoff = 55; other parameters remained at the default values.

kaas  <cit>  was used to assign the unigene ests to pathways based on kegg orthology   <cit> . unigenes were mapped to the corresponding kegg pathways using the comparison method of bi-directional best hit.

gcrv infection of grass carp and preparation of rna sample
the gcrv- <dig> strain was provided by the gaobo biotechnology company . one-year-old grass carp with an average weight of 180–210 g were intraperitoneally injected with 150– <dig> μl gcrv, a dosage of approximately  <dig> tcid <dig> kg- <dig> body weight. the injected grass carp were raised in clean tanks at 28°c. three infected grass carp with typical hemorrhage symptoms  and three uninfected grass carp  were selected at 5d after infection for further study. total rna was extracted from the head kidney of both groups using trizol reagent. cdna was obtained after reverse transcription and used for solexa sequencing.

three-month-old grass carp with an average weight of 30–60 g were intraperitoneally injected with 50– <dig> μl gcrv, a dosage of approximately  <dig> tcid <dig> kg- <dig> body weight; fish in the control group were injected with same amount of saline. the grass carp were raised in clean tanks at 28°c. at 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d after infection ten gcrv-infected carp were selected for further study . ten uninfected fish were selected from the control group at 0d . the whole fish was immediately used for rna isolation. cdna was obtained after reverse transcription and used for the detection of gene expression.

solexa sequencing and expression profile analysis
the nlaiii and mmei digestion method  <cit>  was used to build a 21-bp cdna tag library of the two groups , the control group and the gcrv-infected group. the tags in the two libraries end with different illumina adapter sequences. the raw sequencing read length was 35 bp. the solexa sequencing was performed by the beijing genomics institute .

the raw sequence data was processed through basecalling, the adapter and low quality sequences were removed, and cleaned 21-bp tags were obtained. we converted the cleaned tag number into the standard  number of transcripts per million , and calculated the logarithm of tpm for each of the cleaned tags from the control and gcrv-infected groups. we used a dual limit of p < <dig>  and fpr  < <dig> , to find cleaned tags with log2ratio ≥  <dig> or log2ratio ≤ − <dig>  <cit> . the selected tags have differential expression levels of more than 2-fold in both groups. we then compared the differential expressed tags with the unigenes from the cdna library using seqmap  <cit> ; mismatch was set to  <dig>  and sense and antisense strands were considered in the mapping.

semi-quantitative rt-pcr and race cloning
total rna was used to synthesize the first strand cdna. upstream and downstream primers  were designed based on the unigene sequences. β-actin  was used as the internal reference. pcr and electrophoresis was used to detect the change of expression level.

3' and 5' race was performed using the bd smart race cdna amplification kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. upstream and downstream primers used in the 3' and 5' race were designed based on the est sequences . full length cdna sequences of each gene were assembled using the 3' and 5' terminal sequences.

RESULTS
head kidney cdna library of grass carp
the storage capacity of the original library was 6 ×  <dig>  in the form of the e. coli dh5α cells that were stored on the  <dig> 96-well plates in a total of  <dig>  clones. one hundred randomly selected clones were used for further study. the pcr test results showed that the size of inserts was between 1– <dig> kilobases, the library reorganization was  <dig> % and the no-load rate was  <dig> %.

est sequence analysis
 <dig>  est clones were sequenced, and  <dig>  fasta sequences  with an average read length of 470 bp were obtained. after removing the vector and sequences less than 100 bp long,  <dig>  cleaned ests  were obtained. after clustering and assembly, we obtained  <dig>  unigene est sequences,  <dig>  of which were contigs and  <dig>   of which were singletons; the library redundancy was  <dig> %. most genes in the library exhibited low-level expression, only a small number of genes exhibited high-abundance expression. the number of low expression unigenes, the singletons, was  <dig>  ; the number of medium expression unigenes, those containing 2– <dig> ests was  <dig> ; and the number of high expression unigenes, those that contained six or more ests, was  <dig> . only  <dig> unigenes contained more than  <dig> ests. the average length of the unigenes was 431 bp and  <dig> % of the unigenes were 300–500 bp long .

blast searches and go functional classification
the  <dig>  unigenes were used as queries in blast searches of the ncbi nucleotide and protein sequence databases and the swissprot database.  <dig>  unigenes  matched sequences in the nucleotide sequence database,  <dig>  unigenes  matched sequences in protein sequence database and  <dig>  unigenes  matched sequences in the swissprot database. in all,  <dig>  unigenes  matched sequences in at least one of the three databases; the remaining  <dig> unigenes  were not found  in any of the three databases and may be novel gene sequences.

using the gene ontology  classification, we successfully assigned functional annotations to  <dig>  of the unigene sequences. in the go biological process ontology, three terms accounted for the largest proportion of unigenes, they were cellular process, metabolic process and biological regulation; in the go molecular function ontology, the three most commonly occurring terms were binding, catalytic activity and structural molecule activity; and in the go cellular component ontology, cell, cell part and organelle were the terms that occurred most frequently . of the  <dig>  go-annotated unigenes,  <dig> were immune system process-related genes ,  <dig> were response to virus, and  <dig> were response to bacterium process-related genes . some unigenes were assigned multiple functions. not all of the unigenes could be mapped to the lower level go terms.

kegg pathway analysis
a total of  <dig> of the  <dig>  were assigned a kegg ontology  annotation; they were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways. three most frequently occurring kegg pathways were ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and proteasome.  <dig> unigenes mapped to immune-related pathways including leukocyte transendothelial migration, antigen processing and presentation, chemokine signalling pathway, and t cell receptor signalling pathway . we found that  <dig> unigenes from head kidney in grass carp have been reported to be involved in the following pathways, toll-like receptor signalling pathway, rig-i-like receptor signalling pathway and the nod-like receptor signalling pathway .

expression profiling analysis
by solexa sequencing, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw tags from the transcriptomes of head kidney tissue from grass carp before and after gcrv infection, respectively. after removing low quality sequences, adapter sequences and single copy sequence the cleaned tag numbers were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  respectively. the final numbers of non-redundant distinct tags were  <dig>  and  <dig>  before and after gcrv infection, respectively. all tags were submitted to sra at ncbi under the accession no. sra <dig> . of the distinct tags,  <dig>  were differentially expressed by more than 2-fold between the gcrv-infected and uninfected groups.

these  <dig>  differentially expressed tags mapped to  <dig>  unigenes using seqmap  <cit> . of the differentially expressed tags,  <dig>  mapped to  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes ;  <dig> of the unigenes were up-regulated genes,  <dig> were down-regulated genes. the remaining  <dig> unigenes mapped to tags that exhibited both up and down regulation, and so these unigenes were not included in the statistics. the up- and down-regulated genes were mainly annotated with the go terms, genetic information processing, metabolism, and cellular processes and  <dig> unigenes were annotated with the go term immune-related . we found  <dig> tags that mapped onto  <dig> of the  <dig> unknown unigenes. these are potentially infection related novel genes;  <dig> of them were up-regulated between the gcrv-infected and uninfected groups, and  <dig> were down-regulated genes .

cloning and expression regulation analysis of the novel genes
using semi-quantitative rt-pcr, we examined the gene expression changes of the  <dig> potentially novel unigenes that were detected in the head kidney after viral infection. by comparing the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 5 day post-infection samples and the samples from the control group, we found four unigenes that showed a significant response to the viral infection: cichka_cluster <dig> and cichka_cluster <dig> were up-regulated in days  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection after which their expressions returned to the starting level; cichka_cluster <dig> and cichka_cluster <dig> were up-regulated in days  <dig> and  <dig> post-infection, and the increased expression levels were maintained till day  <dig> .

the full-length cdna sequences of these four unigenes were  <dig>  bp ,  <dig>  bp ,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  encoding polypeptides of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. blast searches revealed that cichka_cluster <dig> can encode a protein that is similar to the vertebrate endonuclease domain containing protein, cichka_cluster <dig> can encode a protein that is similar to the vertebrate ankyrin repeat domain  <dig> protein, cichka_cluster <dig> can encode a protein that is similar to the cst complex subunit ten1; for the cichka_cluster <dig> encoded protein, no similar sequences were found in the databases that we searched, suggesting that cichka_cluster <dig> may represent a novel gene in grass carp. we used the smart server  <cit>  to predict the domain structure of the  <dig> novel unigenes and found that  <dig> % of them contained the endonuclease domain  <dig> that is found in proteins that are involved in the apoptosis pathway, and  <dig> % contained the ankyrin repeat domain that is present in proteins that are involved in pathways that include the b cell receptor signalling pathway, the t cell receptor signalling pathway, and the apoptosis pathway. the cichka_cluster <dig> unigene contained no obvious structural domains; the cichka_cluster <dig> encoded protein contained two transmembrane domains and may be a transmembrane protein.

discussion
currently, there are about  <dig>  sequences of grass carp in the public databases. this situation does not reflect the extremely important breeding position of grass carp. in this study, we built a head kidney non-normalized cdna library of healthy grass carp and obtained  <dig>  unigene est sequences. this library greatly enriches the available genomic data for grass carp and lays an important foundation for the discovery of novel genes and for their functional investigation.

go analysis revealed that the annotated unigenes were mainly related to genes involved in basic biological processes such as cellular process , metabolic process  and biological regulation . this functional distribution is similar to the est distributions reported earlier in the head kidney of zebrafish  <cit>  and sea bass  <cit> .

of the unigenes that were similar to immune-related genes,  <dig> unigenes were annotated as associated with the immune process;  <dig> were related to the immune system process,  <dig> were annotated as response to virus, and  <dig> were related to response to bacteria. among the  <dig> unigenes that were assigned ko annotations,  <dig> were mapped to immune-related pathways that included leukocyte transendothelial migration, antigen processing and presentation, chemokine signalling pathway and t cell receptor signalling pathway. by examining the literature, we found that  <dig> of the unigenes in grass carp head kidney were related to fish genes that were reported to be involved in the toll-like receptor signalling pathway, the rig-i-like receptor signalling pathway and the nod-like receptor signalling pathway. clearly, head kidney tissue plays an important role in immune processes in fish. est databases of head kidney tissue are likely to become important resources in which immune-related genes can be identified.

in the  <dig>  unigene library of head kidney in grass carp,  <dig> %  failed to match any of the sequences in the three public databases that were searched. of the  <dig> unigenes that were the most highly expressed in grass carp head kidney,  <dig> were unknown sequences . this could be partly because sequence data for fish is still very scarce, and partly because fish head kidney tissue may contain tissue-specific or species-specific genes. est databases can be important resources for identifying unknown genes in fish  <cit> . in recent years, the fish transcriptome has been used to study the regulation of gene expression. pardo et al  conducted a comparative study of turbot expression profiles in the main immune tissue before and after pathogen infection to find genes that were related to immune response and disease resistance  <cit> . chini et al  carried out a comparative study of reproductive development-related tissues in bluefin tuna using transcriptome research methods to explore the molecular mechanism of gonadal development and maturity split  <cit> . indeed, comparative transcriptome analysis can be used, not only to investigate the mechanisms of expression and regulation of known genes, but also as an effective means to find important and novel function-related genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we carried out a comparative analysis to find differences in the solexa expression profiles of head kidney in grass carp before and after infection, and identified  <dig> unigenes of unknown function that showed differential expression in response to the pathogen. after rt-pcr validation of the cdna and gene structure analysis, we found a potentially novel immune-related gene. based on its response to viral infection and the prediction that it might encode a membrane protein, we speculate that this novel gene may encode a virus receptor or a protein that mediates the immune signalling pathway at the cell surface. we intend to further investigate the function of this gene in a future study. our findings confirm that fish tissue-specific est databases combined with comparative transcriptome analysis are effective tools that can direct the discovery of novel functional genes.
