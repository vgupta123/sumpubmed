BACKGROUND
flavonoids with a variegated structure are extensively scattered across most plants in nature and play pivotal roles in plant acclimatization to varying environments. for example, they provide a strong defense against insect infestation  <cit>  herbivores  <cit> , and pathogenic microorganisms  <cit>  and also conduct signal molecules to the environment to promote interaction with symbiotic bacteria  <cit>  and viruses  <cit> . pigmentosusflavonoids act as visual and olfactory hits to attract pollinators and herbivores and protect against light intensity, temperature, and biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . moreover, they provide abundant resources for agents that promote and maintain health  <cit> .

because of their significance in genetic investigations and biomedicine, flavonoid biosynthesis has attracted considerable scientific attention over the years  <cit> . the pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis has been basically clarified through enzymologic studies in the plant model arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . however, the secondary metabolic pathways in plants are extremely complex. although the metabolic pathways in the model plant are understood, these pathways have different regulation mechanisms in another species or in a specific variety, especially when the flavonoids differ from those in the model plant. therefore, it is essential to identify species-specific genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.

safflower  is not only cultivated as an oilseed crop but also widely used as a traditional medicine in china. modern pharmacologic experiments have shown that safflower, along with its active compounds, has wide-reaching biological activities, including dilating the coronary artery, improving myocardial ischemia, and modulating immune responses  <cit> . many researches on phytochemistry have shown that safflower synthesizes a striking variety of flavonoids, such as quinochalcones  and flavonols , among others  <cit> . simultaneously, investigations on the genome and transcriptome of safflower have also been carried out, annotating the unigenes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and fatty acids  <cit> . thus far, the genes encoding isochorismate synthase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, oleoylphosphatidylcholinedesaturase , phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase in safflower have been cloned and characterized . nonetheless, studies on genes encoding enzymes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and the identification of their functions are still lacking.

flavanone 3-hydroxylase  is one of the nuclear enzymes acting at the bifurcation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, initiating catalysis of the 3-hydroxylation of -flavanones, such as naringenin to dihydroflavonols  <cit> . the majority of f3h genes in the flavonoid metabolic pathway have been obtained from many different plants, including ginkgo biloba  <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , reaumuria soongorica  <cit> , reaumur trigyna  <cit> , triticum aestivum l.  <cit> , and camellia sinensis  <cit> , and subsequently characterized. however, no investigations on bioinformation analysis and functional identification of f3h gene in safflower have been reported. meanwhile, no investigation on the cellular level of f3h enzyme has been done. to understand the flavonoids biosynthesis in safflower, two different safflower lines, a quinochalcone-type line with orange-yellow flowers and a flavonol-type line with white flowers were selected and conducted to research the f3h function and characterization in safflower . the full length of ctf3h was cloned, and its open reading frame was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pmal-c5x for protein expression and in vitro enzyme activity identification. also, the recombination of ctf3h and pcambia-1380-camv35s-mcs-egfp-nos  was constructed to study its subcellular localization. simultaneously, we investigated its transcriptome expression patterns and the accumulation of selected flavonoids in the corolla of the two chemotyped safflower lines  under meja induction.fig.  <dig> the two safflower lines: a zhh <dig> line. b xhh <dig> line



RESULTS
characterization of ctf3h
the cdna of ctf3h contained an 1086bp open reading frame encoding 361aa. the molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric points were  <dig>  kda and  <dig> , respectively. the alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences indicated that the ctf3h protein contained 2-odd  superfamily conserved domains as other f3h proteins: the 2-oxoglutarate binding domain rxs  and the ferrous iron binding site hxdxnh  . the conservation observed in these amino acids revealed that ctf3h protein has a potential biological function. a phylogenic tree analysis indicated that ctf3h is more closely related to f3hs dahlia pinnate, gynura bicolor and pilosella officinarum .fig.  <dig> alignment of ctf3h with f3h proteins from other species. genbank accession numbers for the proteins in the alignment are as follow: acf3h , ccf3h , agf3h , dcf3h, atf3h , gmf3h , ghf3h , caf3h , ctf3h , dpf3h , gbf3h , ccf3h , pof3h , cmf3h  and ntf3h . the sequences were aligned using dnaman software. the fe2+-binding sites and oxoglutarate-binding sites are indicated by empty  or filled  triangles, and the conserved 2-oxoglutarate-fe oxygenase domain is shown in the black box



subcellular localization of ctf3h
the probable subcellular localization of ctf3h was computationally analyzed by using the wolf psort program, and the results indicated that ctf3h may be localized in the cytoplasm or nucleus. to identify the exact localization of ctf3h, the fusion construct of ctf3h and gfp , controlled by the camv 35s promoter, and the gfp vector alone were introduced into onion epidermal cells through mediation of the agrobacterium strain gv <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  the onion epidermal cells infected with agrobacterium harboring the ctf3h-gfp protein emitted gfp signals predominately in the nucleus, cytosol and cytomembrane. however, onion cells transformed with gfp vector alone exhibited gfp signals in the cytomembrane. the results implied that ctf3h was a nuclear and cytosol localized protein, giving some clues for its function in the biological processes of plant.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of the gfp-ctf3h fusion protein in onion epidermal cells. the fluorescence emission signals were determined by a confocal laser scanning microscope



purification and in vitro activity of ctf3h
to show the enzyme activity of ctf3h in vitro, crude recombinant protein expressed in e. coli was purified by using an amylase resin column. as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  lane  <dig>  the ctf3h protein without mbp  tag presented a molecular weight of about 40kda, consistent with the size of the predicted ctf3h protein. the in vitro activity of ctf3h was also examined, with naringenin, kaempferol, dihydrokaempferol, quercetin and dihydroquercetin as the substrates. however, only naringenin could be catalyzed by ctf3h protein and generated other product. other four compounds could not been catalyzed by ctf3h protein to yield other product. our data suggested that one product  was recognized apart from the naringenin and solvent peaks , which shared the same retention time as dihydrokaempferol . the lc-ms/ms analysis indicated that the product had a molecular ion - at a mass-to-charge ratio  of  <dig>  along with daughter ions with m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ; this is consistent with the product from the authentic standard of dihydrokaempferol . the result was also coincident with that f3h could convert naringenin to dihydrokaempferol from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> .fig.  <dig> in vitro activity of recombinant ctf3h protein without mbp-tag using naringenin as substrate. a-d uhplc-ms-esi profiles of naringenin, the reaction products catalyzed by ctf3h protein using naringenin as substrate, dihydrokaempferol and solvents peak without ctf3h protein and naringenin. e-f the mass spectrometry profile of reaction product  and dihydrokaempferol standard



the kinetic parameters of ctf3h were tested by using a range of naringenin concentrations. the initial velocity v <dig> plotted against the naringenin concentration generated a rectangular hyperbola with vmax =  μm/min and km =  mm . our data suggested that ctf3h was effective in catalyzing naringenin into dihydrokaempferol, demonstrating its role in the pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis.

expression level analysis of ctf3h in the flower tissue of two safflower lines
to emphasize the role of the ctf3h gene in the pathway of flavonols in safflower and abiotic stress, ctf3h was first selected to analyze its meja-stimulated responses in two chemotyped safflower lines  by carrying out quantitative real-time pcr. as shown in fig. 5a, the ctf3h gene expression level in flowers of the zhh <dig> line gradually increased over time. its expression level at  <dig> h after treatment was also distinctly higher than that at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after treatment, indicating statistically significant difference . this result suggested that ctf3h may play a role in the defense response of safflower. however, no significant effect of elicitor addition was observed at  <dig> h and  <dig> h compared with that at  <dig> h . contrary to its expression level in flowers of the zhh <dig> line, the ctf3h gene transcript abundance in the xhh <dig> line was continuously suppressed by meja treatment over  <dig> h, indicating a statistically significant differences at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h compared with that at  <dig> h . this result implied that the ctf3h expression level in flowers of the zhh <dig> line was positively regulated by meja treatment, which in xhh <dig> line could be perturbated.fig.  <dig> quantitative real-time pcr analysis of ctf3h relative expression of flower tissue in zhh <dig> line  and xhh <dig> line  at different time points post-treatment with meja. each plant was individually assayed in triplicate . relative expression of ctf3h gene is normalized to ct60s as control and compared with the relative expression without meja treatment at different time points using 2-△△ct method. asterisks indicate a significant difference from  <dig> h 



accumulation profiling of flavonoids in flower tissue under meja stimulation
the extracted fragment mass ions of the authentic standards were as follows: hydroxysafflor yellow a: m/z  <dig>  , rutin: m/z  <dig>  , quercetin3-β-d-glucoside: m/z  <dig>  , scutellarin: m/z  <dig>  , kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside: m/z  <dig>  , kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside: m/z  <dig>  , dihydrokaempferol: m/z  <dig>  , luteolin: m/z  <dig>  , apigenin: m/z  <dig> , carthamin: m/z  <dig>  , and kaempferol: m/z  <dig>  . profiles of the eic  are presented in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  processed by using the masshunter qualitative analysis software  for peak fitting,  <dig> targeted compounds were detected in flowers of the zhh <dig> line: hydroxysafflor yellow a, rutin, quercetin3-β-d-glucoside, kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside, luteolin, carthamin, and kaempferol . further comparative analysis revealed that the contents of these  <dig> targeted compounds in flowers of the zhh <dig> line showed different accumulation pattern under meja induction compared with that at  <dig> h . hydroxysafflor yellow a was a characteristic and dominant content in the zhh <dig> line, and its accumulation at 3h, 6h, and 12h consistently increased in response to meja stimulation, showing a statistically significant difference when compared with that at  <dig> h . carthamin, another quinochalcone-type compound in the zhh <dig> line, was positively regulated by meja stimulation. on the other hand, the flavonol-type content in the zhh <dig> line responsed to meja treatment also displayed dissimilar increased tendency. the accumulation of kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and rutin were enhanced significantly both at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after meja treatment . nonetheless, accumulation of kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside, kaempferol, luteolin and quercetin-3-β-d-glucoside displayed no statistically significant alteration responsed to meja stimulation. regarding the accumulation in flowers of the xhh <dig> line,  <dig> identified compounds showed different accumulation tendency . accumulation of apigenin and dihydrokaempferol were apparently depressed after  <dig> hour of meja stimulation, indicating statistical difference when compared with those at  <dig> h . however, their accumulation at  <dig> h and  <dig> h were increased to the level that was no statistically difference with those at  <dig> h. marked reduction were also observed on accumulation of kaempferol and d-phenylalanine. on contrast, accumulation of kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and rutin were shown persistently up regulated pattern. in addition, accumulation of quercetin3-β-d-glucoside and scutellarin were discovered no statistically significant change, although quercetin3-β-d-glucoside at 3h after meja treatment represented decreased accumulation . kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside, kaempferol, rutin, quercetin3-β-d-glucoside and d-phenylalanine were recognized in both zhh <dig> and xhh <dig> lines. except enhanced accumulation of kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and rutin in both two safflower lines, kaempferol, quercetin3-β-d-glucoside and d-phenylalanine diaplayed converse or dissimilar accumulated pattern. on the whole, the relative content of kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside, rutin and quercetin3-β-d-glucoside were lower than those in xhh <dig> line, which showed a converse result for the accumulation of kaempferol. these results suggested the accumulation patterns of flavonoids in two safflower lines respond to meja treatment were different, further indicating the potential formation mechanism of two phenotyped and chemotyped safflower lines.fig.  <dig> the total eci profiles of zhh <dig> line  and xhh <dig> line . detected compounds are labeled with letters. a, d-phenylalanine; b, hydroxysafflor yellow a; c, rutin; d, quercetin3-β-d-glucoside; e, scutellarin; f, kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside; g, kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside; h, dihydrokaempferol; i, luteolin; j, apigenin; k, carthamin; l, kaempferol

discussion
flavonoids, which accumulate abundantly in safflower, have been shown to have distinct biological properties. various flavonoids have been separated and identified from safflower; however, their metabolic pathways still remain largely inexplicit. in the present study, we carried out a sequence analysis of ctf3h and investigated its activity in vitro, as well as its transcript abundance and metabolic accumulation in two safflower lines treated with meja.

f3h is classified under feii and 2-odd  <cit> . all the f3hs were featured with two conserved motifs: hxdxnh  for binding feii and rxs  for binding 2-og   <cit> . these conserved residues were also disclosed in ctf3h. our research results also suggested that ctf3h has a highly homologous relationship with f3h from other plants. these bioinformation analysis were suggested the potential function of ctf3h in flavonoid biosynthesis pathway of safflower.

at the cellular level, flavonoids are deposited in various cellular compartments, such as the vacuole, cell wall, vesicles, cytosol, chloroplast, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum, and then integrated into proteins and nucleic acids to participate in crucial biological processes  <cit> . flavonoid enzymes located in plant nuclei are believed to act as dna protectors against uv and oxidative damage or to directly or indirectly regulate the transcription of genes that are requisite to growth and development  <cit> . in the present study, the results of subcellular localization implied that ctf3h protein was localized to the nucleus and cytosol, which not only enriched but further supported the previous viewpoint  <cit> , who pointed out that chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase which are involved in flavonoid metabolism in arabidopsis, are present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of some cells.

the analysis of its in vitro enzyme activity indicated that ctf3h was effective in catalyzing the formation of dihydrokaempferol when naringenin was the substrate, which is compatible with the involvement of f3h in the flavonol biosynthesis pathway. the km and vmax at  <dig> °c were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min, respectively. however, the km of ctf3h  was higher than that of atf3h. these differences may reflect, to some extent, the unalloyed distinction of f3h genes between safflower and arabidopsis thaliana, which may be attributed to their far evolution relationship from each other or to different reaction conditions, such as the temperature and reaction systems.

in nature, flowering is a crucial developmental process toward ensuring the survival and reproductive success of plants  <cit> . this process is affected by environmental and internal factors. meja, as a plant endogenous signaling molecule, has been shown to regulate vernalization, seed germination, root growth, flowering, fruit ripening, and senescence . also, meja has been identified as a predominant inducer of global genes involved in secondary metabolite pathways the accumulation of such genes in various plants, such as sweet basil  <cit>  and medicago truncatula  <cit> . as a flowering plant, the effect of meja on the transcript level of ctf3h and the flavonoid production in flowers of two chemotyped safflower lines were uncovered. plant phenotype is the ultimate result of gene expression difference regulated by strict spatial and temporal conditions  <cit> . f3h gene mutations could affect color pigmentation, as previously noted in petunia, soybean, japanese morning glory, carnation, and torenia . in the present study, the transcript level of ctf3h in a safflower line with orange-yellow flowers was gradually upregulated within  <dig> hours under meja application. in contrast, a gradual down regulation in a white-flowered safflower line was observed, suggesting a likely cause of colorless flower phenotypes. the converse expression pattern of ctf3h in response to meja in two safflower lines may, to some extent, reflect the molecular mechanism underlying the different chemotypes of safflower. moreover, many phenotypic characters of a plant depend largely on the accumulation of various metabolites in particular organs and tissues or at particular times in the plant life cycle following specific  signals. a further analysis of the metabolite accumulation in the orange-yellow–flowered safflower line showed increasing contents of hydroxysafflor yellow a, carthamin, kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and rutin. kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and rutin in white-flowered safflower line were also displayed increasing accumulation under meja induction. except enhanced accumulation of kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and rutin in both two safflower lines, other compounds in two safflower lines were shown converse or dissimilar accumulated pattern. additionally, not all the selected compounds were recognized in both orange-yellow–flowered safflower line and white-flowered safflower line. these differential accumulation patterns of flavonoids may further indicate the formation mechanism in two phenotypes and chemotypes of safflower.

CONCLUSIONS
to studies on genes encoding enzymes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and the identification of their functions in safflower, this study first cloned the f3h gene from safflower and then elucidated its function by in vitro enzymatic experimentation and analysis of its expression, as well as of flavonoid accumulation in response to meja treatment. the analysis of its in vitro enzyme activity indicated that ctf3h was effective in catalyzing the formation of dihydrokaempferol when naringenin was the substrate, which is compatible with the involvement of f3h in the flavonol biosynthesis pathway. the results of subcellular localization implied that ctf3h protein was localized to the nucleus and cytosol. the results of its expression and flavonoid accumulation in response to meja treatment showed that ctf3h had converse expression patterns in two safflower lines under meja induction. its high expression in orange-yellow–flowered safflower was related with the accumulation of both quinochalcones and flavonols, whereas its low expression did not affect the accumulation of flavonol in the white-flowered safflower, which partly revealed the function of ctf3h in different phenotypes and chemotypes of safflower lines. these findings also implied that other f3h genes from safflower or transposable elements may positively regulate the accumulation of flavonols in white-flowered safflower. our study thus provides a hypothetical and practical groundwork for increasing the flavonoid accumulation in safflower. further investigations are needed to verify the function and roles of other ctf3hs in other safflower lines.
