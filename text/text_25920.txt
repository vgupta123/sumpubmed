BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects a wide range of hosts, including an estimated one-third of the world’s human population
 <cit> . the resulting disease toxoplasmosis can be serious in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals, and as an opportunistic infection associated with aids and cancer patients
 <cit> . t. gondii and its evolutionary relatives, the coccidia, form a clade of parasitic protozoa involved in many human and veterinary diseases such as toxoplasmosis and coccidiosis. coccidians are a lineage within the protozoan phylum apicomplexa, which also includes the deadly malaria pathogen plasmodium falciparum. thus, t. gondii also serves as an experimentally tractable model organism for studying the shared and contrasting biological properties of the apicomplexa and other intracellular parasites
 <cit> .

apicomplexans contain a unique system of apical organelles called the apical complex, consisting of rhoptries, micronemes and dense granules
 <cit> . at the initiation of host cell invasion, the contents of the rhoptries are injected into the host cell and the forming parasitophorous vacuole which protects the intracellular parasite
 <cit> . once there, the parasite proteins can disrupt host cell signaling and defense mechanisms and assist in recruiting host organelles
 <cit> .

proteomic profiling of t. gondii rhoptries
 <cit>  and analyis of apicomplexan genomic sequences
 <cit>  revealed that many of the proteins secreted by coccidians are protein kinases, a class of enzymes that regulate cell signal transduction through phosphorylation. this expanded, rapidly evolving family of kinases and pseudokinases has been termed the rhoptry kinase  family
 <cit> , or rop <dig> family, in reference to a representative member of the family
 <cit> . while rhoptry kinases appear to be unique to the coccidia, the involvement of lineage-specific protein kinase families in host-parasite interactions is observed across the apicomplexa
 <cit> . several rhoptry kinases have been shown to be involved in virulence and alteration of host cell transcription
 <cit> . these include rop <dig>  a key modulator of parasite growth and virulence which is localized to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane 
 <cit> , and rop <dig>  another pvm-associated protein which assists rop <dig> in blocking the host immune response
 <cit> . rop <dig> localizes to the host cell nucleus and interacts with the stat <dig> and stat <dig> immune-response signaling pathways
 <cit> , and rop <dig> has been implicated in the modulation of host mapk signaling
 <cit> .

protein kinases are a diverse family of enzymes which have been successfully targeted for inhibition in human cancers, and show promise for treating infections by protozoan pathogens as well
 <cit> . atp-competitive small-molecule inhibitors have been developed to specifically target catalytically active protein kinases in parasitic protozoa
 <cit> . since many of the ropks appear to also be catalytically active, there may be an opportunity to target these kinases for infectious diseases. however, the “catalytic triad” of residues considered essential for kinase enzymatic activity
 <cit>  is altered in about half of the identified ropks
 <cit> . pseudokinases have been observed to perform important functions in other systems, typically through inducing allosteric changes in other interacting partners . the overall expansion of pseudokinases in the ropk family underscores observations that some catalytically inactive ropks nonetheless play important, functional roles through interaction with other proteins
 <cit> . structural studies showed that the pseudokinase virulence factors rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> do indeed form a protein kinase fold; rop <dig> and rop <dig> were indicated to be unable to bind atp
 <cit> , while rop <dig> was shown to bind atp in an atypical, noncatalytic conformation
 <cit> . an interplay between rop <dig>  the active kinase rop <dig> and a host immunity-related gtpase has been identified
 <cit> , demonstrating the potential for complex interplay between rhoptry kinases and the host cell signaling pathways. however, the full extent of the diversity in ropk family, in terms of function, potential interacting partners, protein structure and structural mechanisms, is poorly understood. with the availability of molecular sequence and structural data from multiple strains of t. gondii and related apicomplexans, we can use comparative methods to examine the molecular evolution of ropks and identify functional shifts that may point to distinct regulatory roles and mechanisms.

we catalogued the rhoptry kinases in several fully sequenced coccidian genomes, including toxoplasma gondii, neospora caninum, sarcocystis neurona and eimeria tenella, and compared them to the broader eukaryotic protein kinase  superfamily and to each other to study the patterns of diversification and neofunctionalization in the ropk family and its subfamilies. we propose previously unidentified rhoptry kinases in each of these genomes, including several putative new ropk subfamilies. we studied the variation in these subfamilies in light of the solved structures of rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> proteins, and relative to “typical” eukaryotic protein kinases. both pseudokinases and catalytically active kinases appear to be prevalent throughout the ropk family. we found a striking co-evolution of structural inserts within the canonical protein kinase domain and the residues that interact with them. most noteworthy among these is a pattern of residues surrounding the ropk-specific αc’ helix in the kinase “hinge” region. we also recovered another pattern of co-conserved cysteines that form a disulfide bond in the substrate-binding c-lobe. we then discuss some possible functional consequences of these distinguishing features of the ropk family.

RESULTS
to examine the molecular evolution and functional shifts in ropks, we used the genomic, mrna and proteomic sequences of multiple t. gondii strains, neospora caninum, sarcocystis neurona and eimeria tenella to develop profiles for  <dig> subfamilies of ropk, reflecting orthology as well as chromosomal patterns of tandem repeats .

we used these sequence profiles to perform an analysis of evolutionary constraints, applying statistical tests of contrasting conservation between gene clades to identify potential sites of subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization in the ropk family and each ropk subfamily. we then mapped the sites and regions of interest onto solved structures of rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> to examine the structural and possible functional roles these features may play within the parasite proteins.

global trends in the ropk family
we used a set of hmm profiles derived from our subfamily sequence alignments to scan the translated gene model sequences available for t. gondii strains gt <dig>  me <dig> and veg, n. caninum and e. tenella and classify putative ropk genes into the identified subfamilies. we found  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ropk genes in t. gondii strains gt <dig>  me <dig> and veg, respectively,  <dig> in n. caninum and  <dig> in e. tenella . the elevated ropk counts in t. gondii me <dig> relative to the other strains is probably due to differences in sequencing depth and the quality of assembly and gene model annotation; we also found genomic evidence of unannotated orthologs in the other strains. as suggested by reese and boyle
 <cit> , ropk genes are often present in expanded loci  and are probably undercounted in annotated genomes.

by incorporating sequences from multiple coccidian species into hmm profiles, we were able to identify several putative ropks that were not identified in previous computational surveys
 <cit> . these include the proposed subfamilies rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  present in t. gondii and n. caninum, and the e. tenella-specific subfamilies ropk-eten <dig>  ropk-eten2a, ropk-eten2b, ropk-eten <dig>  ropk-eten <dig>  ropk-eten <dig> and ropk-eten <dig>  we suggest these to be likely rhoptry kinases on the basis of sequence homology, phylogenetic placement, signal peptide presence, and existing experimental evidence. protein or mrna expression has been previously observed for at least one member of each of these proposed subfamilies, indicating that they are not pseudogenes. rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> are predicted to contain a signal peptide. the gene coding for rop <dig> has only been annotated in t. gondii strain me <dig> , but we identified genomic regions with 95% sequence identity to this protein sequence on chromosome x of strains veg and gt <dig> as well. recently, a proteomics study observed two e. tenella proteins expressed during the sporozoite stage and localized in the rhoptries: eth_ <dig>  which we assigned to the ropk-eten <dig> subfamily, and eth_ <dig>  which we assigned to the ropk-unique category
 <cit> . a search of the available s. neurona ests and genomic scaffolds indicates that ropks are prevalent in this species as well, though we cannot assign a specific number until the assembly is complete. the subfamilies that have clear representatives in all four of the surveyed species are rop21/ <dig> and rop <dig> 

in s. neurona, rhoptries are present in the sporozoite
 <cit>  and bradyzoite
 <cit>  stages but absent from schizonts and merozoites
 <cit> . surprisingly, we found s. neurona genomic regions and expressed sequence tags  from the schizont and merozoite stages that appear to code for rhoptry kinases. of the ests currently available in the ncbi genbank est database, we identified seven putative rhoptry kinases , all obtained from the s. neurona merozoite stage, evidence that these genes are indeed expressed despite the absence of rhoptry organelles during this life stage. we also examined genomic open reading frames  for signal peptides using the program signalp
 <cit>  and identified likely signal peptide regions and cleavage sites in several of the orfs that we predicted to encode rhoptry kinases, suggesting that at least some of these are likely to be exported.

both pseudokinases and catalytically active kinases appear to be prevalent throughout the ropk family, in roughly equal numbers of subfamilies. the pseudokinase subfamilies are distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree, rather than forming any distinct clade, suggesting that the evolutionary pressures that lead to the degeneration of paralogs into pseudokinases have applied throughout the ropk family.

phylogenetic clustering reveals distinct sub-clades
we inferred a phylogenetic tree from the consensus sequences of each of the ropk subfamilies to illustrate evolutionary patterns within the ropk family . several distinct clades emerged, which we examined more specifically: rhoptry kinases with homology to the n-terminal extension  observed in rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> structures ; an expanded clade of seven subfamilies specific to e. tenella; and a basal clade of divergent, ropk-like protein kinases, including rop <dig> and bpk <dig>  which we refer to as ropkl here.

within the e. tenella-specific clade, the putative ropk proteins eth_ <dig>  eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig>  which we placed in the subfamilies eten2b, eten <dig> and eten <dig>  respectively, were recently observed to be expressed solely in merozoites
 <cit> . the emergence of this gene clade reflects the significant phylogenetic and phenotypic divergence of the oocyst-forming e. tenella from the other tissue-cyst-forming coccidian species we have examined here
 <cit> . e. tenella also contains several putative ropks outside this clade, more closely related to the ropks found in t. gondii and n. caninum, which we placed in the ropk-unique category .

the previously identified proteins in the ropkl clade are rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  the clade also contains the brazyzoite-expressed pseudokinase bpk1
 <cit> . the gene models of the ropkl proteins in t. gondii me <dig>  the best-annotated strain, all contain at least one intron, in contrast to most other ropk genes, which are typically encoded by a single exon.

known or likely catalytic kinases
in our analysis, we consider the catalytically essential residues to be the aspartate in the catalytic loop  and the aspartate in the mg-binding loop at the start of the activation segment ; we categorize the ropk subfamilies missing either of these residues as pseudokinases. additionally important residues involved in atp positioning or conformational changes necessary for catalytic activity include a glycine in subdomain i , lysine in subdomain ii , glutamate in subdomain iii  and asparagine in the catalytic loop 
 <cit> , as well as the f-helix aspartate which positions the catalytic loop 
 <cit> . while catalysis has been observed in kinases that lack one or more of these residues, their absence usually indicates a noncanonical mechanism or impairment of activity
 <cit> .

the subfamilies rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop19/29/ <dig>  rop <dig>  rop21/ <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> were previously suggested to be active kinases based on the conserved catalytic triad
 <cit> . phosphoryl transfer has been demonstrated experimentally for rop18
 <cit>  and rop16
 <cit> , and molecular modelling simulations have shown that atp could dock in a typical conformation to rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop18
 <cit> . our analysis additionally found the catalytically essential residues conserved in rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  suggesting these may also be active kinases. of the e. tenella-specific subfamilies we identified, ropk-eten <dig> also retains all of the key residues needed for catalysis .

known or likely pseudokinases
kinases that lack one or more of the residues necessary for catalysis are likely to be non-catalytic pseudokinases. the apparent pseudokinase ropk subfamilies are rop2/ <dig>  rop4/ <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop42/43/ <dig>  as identified previously
 <cit> . we include bpk <dig>  previously noted as a t. gondii brazyzoite-expressed pseudokinase
 <cit> , in the ropk family based on sequence similarity. additionally, our proposed subfamilies rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  and the e. tenella-specific ropk-eten <dig>  ropk-eten <dig> and ropk-eten <dig>  are also missing key aspartates involved in the kinase catalytic mechanism and are likely to be pseudokinases . rop <dig> does have an aspartate at the hrd+ <dig> position , so in absence of a structure we cannot rule out that this nearby residue may play a compensatory role in catalysis.

several of these pseudokinase subfamilies share the unusual characteristic of replacing the catalytic aspartate  with a basic residue: rop4/ <dig> , rop <dig> , rop <dig> , rop <dig> , rop <dig>  and rop42–43- <dig> , as previously noted
 <cit> .

noncanonical kinases
the subfamilies rop <dig>  rop <dig> and the proposed rop <dig>  ropk-eten2a and ropk-eten2b have most of the residues necessary for catalysis, but with some differences in other typically conserved residues that suggest the mechanisms may be noncanonical .

in most active epks, an asparagine in the catalytic loop  coordinates a magnesium ion to position atp in the active site
 <cit> . this residue varies among some ropks: in rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  the asparagine is replaced by a basic residue . the closely related e. tenella-specific subfamilies ropk-eten2a and ropk-eten2b have the catalytic loop motifs hndlkldg and hndlklss, respectively, each replacing the epk-conserved asparagine with a different residue type. such replacements are rare in catalytically active kinases; in an alignment of epk sequences , we observed only two cases in which the “hrd” motif is conserved without the accomanying asparagine, both of which have been shown to have noncanonical catalytic mechanisms: cask
 <cit> , which replaces the asparagine with a cysteine, and type ii pak
 <cit> , which has a serine.

the epk-conserved lysine in subdomain ii  is replaced with arginine in rop <dig>  ropk-eten2a and ropk-eten2b, though the conserved c-helix glutamate is retained, suggesting the necessary salt bridge could still form in the active state of these kinase as in other epks. in rop <dig>  however, the lysine is retained but the corresponding c-helix glutamate is instead alanine, precluding a salt bridge. the dfg motif is replaced with the sequence gft, though a potentially compensatory acidic residue appears at the dfg+ <dig> position. these observations suggest that the activation mechanism
 <cit>  in rop <dig> could be different from that of other epks. rop <dig> retains the β <dig> lysine, αc glutamate and dfg motif; however, the substrate-binding lobe is quite divergent, with a dramatically shortened activation loop and f-helix, and the f-helix dxw motif is replaced with ess, which suggests that the positioning of the catalytic loop occurs differently from other epks.

the e. tenella-specific subfamily ropk-eten <dig>  in contrast to all the other identified ropk subfamilies, appears to comprise both active and inactive kinases. the locus appears as a tandem repeat of  <dig> similar genes, with pairwise identity ranging from 32% to 52% , only one of which  retains the key residues indicating catalytic function .

ropk-conserved inserts within the protein kinase domain
ropk- and subfamily-specific inserts within the kinase domain are widespread, suggesting unique functional adaptations
 <cit> . we found six conserved inserts in the ropk domain relative to the pk domain . they are: 

 an extension of the β3- αc loop, residues 289– <dig> rop <dig>  of varying length across ropk subfamilies; it is fairly short  in the nte-bearing clade, missing altogether in ropkl, but extends up to  <dig> amino acids other ropks including the e. tenella-specific clade.

 c-terminal to the αc helix, residues 309– <dig> rop <dig>  present in all subfamilies except the ropkl clade in roughly equal size. in the rop2/ <dig> structures  it was observed to form an additional helix, termed αc’
 <cit> , in the kinase inter-lobe hinge area , while in the rop <dig> structures  it is disordered.

 in β4– β <dig> loop, residues 335– <dig> rop <dig>  present in most subfamilies, including rop <dig> but not the other ropkls, in similar size. in a rop <dig> structure  this appears as two β strands, termed β’ and β”, that extend the loop to form a β-hairpin in the kinase n-lobe
 <cit> , spatially near the α” helix of the nte. in the other structure of rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  this region is mostly disordered, though the protein sequences indicate the insert is present in this subfamily as well.

 between the kinase ape motif  and the αf helix, residues 453– <dig> rop <dig>  present in varying lengths across the ropk subfamilies including each of the major clades . this is near the substrate-binding site in typical protein kinases. the insert appears as a short 4aa loop in rop <dig> , but in rop <dig>  and rop <dig>  it forms an additional single-turn helix in crystal structures 
 <cit> , though this feature may have been stabilized in the crystals because of crystal packing.

 an extension of the αf– αg loop, absent from rop2/ <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> and the ropkl clade, but present in rop <dig> and the other ropk subfamilies in the region of residues 467– <dig> rop <dig>  in the rop <dig> structures , b-factors indicate this elongation of the αf– αg loop is relatively flexible compared to the adjacent regions; the g-helix itself appears unfolded. sequences of other ropks, including rop <dig>  suggest it is even longer in those subfamilies.

 in the αg– αh loop, near the c-terminus of the αg helix, a 5aa insert absent from rop2/ <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> and the ropkls but present in the other ropk subfamilies including the e. tenella-specific clade. the ropkls appear to have large deletions in this region, and may be missing the αg helix structure altogether. we note that the αg– αh loop is extended in many other protein kinases, most notably cmgc kinases
 <cit> .

distinguishing ropk-specific conserved sites in the protein kinase domain, and corresponding structural features
we evaluated shifts in site-specific residue conservation between the ropk family and overall pk superfamily by performing a goodness-of-fit test of residue frequences in the two sequence sets at each aligned column of the pk domain . the same comparisons were also performed with each subfamily versus the other ropks .

hinge region
the most statistically significant sites distinguishing ropks from pks overall are in the kinase hinge region. numbered according to rop <dig> , these are: sites  <dig>  l <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and p <dig> in the αc’– β <dig> loop; p <dig> in the β5– αd loop, and  <dig> in the β <dig> strand . two residues in the αe helix,  <dig> and  <dig>  are oriented toward the hinge region and under the αc’ helix.

the residue p <dig> rop <dig> is typically a glutamate in most eukaryotic protein kinases , where it contributes to the opening/closing motion of the kinase during activation by forming a lobe-bridging salt bridge interaction
 <cit> . in fibroblast growth factor receptor kinase , for example, the equivalent residue e <dig> hydrogen-bonds with k <dig> in the β <dig> strand conditionally upon phosphorylation of the fgfr activation loop
 <cit>  . in rop <dig>  the residues equivalent to e <dig> and k <dig> are p <dig> and f <dig>  respectively . since proline and phenylalanine are not charged residues, the rop <dig> structure is incapable of forming the same interaction. the residue p <dig> rop <dig> is conserved as a proline throughout most of the ropk family, with the exception of subfamilies rop <dig> , rop21/ <dig> , rop <dig> , rop <dig> , rop <dig> , and the e. tenella-specific subfamilies  .

the residues at sites p <dig> rop <dig> and p <dig> rop <dig> appear to have instead taken on another structural role. in ropks, the residue immediately n-terminal to p <dig> rop <dig>  a site known as the kinase “gatekeeper” residue, is a large, usually hydrophobic residue oriented toward the αc’- β <dig> strand and, in the rop <dig> structure, packing against the ropk-conserved p326; the hydrophobic residue immediately n-terminal to p <dig>  is likewise oriented toward the linker in the rop <dig> structure, packing against p <dig> . these four residues thus form a stable packing “box” bridging the αc’- β <dig> and β5- αd loops.

f-helix “wc” motif and disulfide bridge
a distinctive “wc” motif appears at the end of the αf helix  in most ropks. the cysteine , together with another ropk-conserved cysteine 
 <cit>  in the αg– αh insert described above, forms a disulfide bond which has been proposed to stabilize the two helices
 <cit> . the tryptophan  appears to pack against the extended αd and αe helices, pushing the αe helix futher outward. thus the “wc” motif couples two ropk-specific inserts to the substrate-binding lobe of the kinase core. there are no other known protein kinase families or subfamilies in which cysteines at the end of the f-helix and in the αg– αh loop co-occur in positions that could potentially interact. additionally, both the wc motif and the αg– αh cysteine are absent from the e. tenella and ropkl clades.

another site in the αf helix  is conserved as a glutamate in most epks , but unconserved in ropks, suggesting that a selective constraint that conserves glutamate at this site in most epks has been lost in the ropk family. in at least some other epks, it appears that this glutamate can interact with a basic residue on the polar/charged surface of the amphipathic αd helix , as well as a conserved tyrosine in the p+ <dig> pocket  at the end of the activation segment . notably, the mutation of e <dig> to glutamine in pka not only disrupted substrate recognition and phosphoryl transfer, but also resulted in higher temperature factors in the αd helix, particularly in r133
 <cit> . however, in ropks the interaction between the f and d helices occurs somewhat differently: in rop <dig>  r <dig> interacts with e <dig> and y <dig>  and in rop <dig>  w <dig> packs with h <dig>  while the p+1-pocket tyr replaced by f <dig>  a side chain not capable of hydrogen bonding .

n-terminal extension to the protein kinase domain
structural studies of rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> revealed another feature common to each of these proteins, an n-terminal extension  to the canonical protein kinase domain consisting of at least two additional helices and a beta sheet, with the region between the two helices varying between rop2/ <dig> and rop5
 <cit> . the nte has also been suggested to be present in rop <dig>  rop4/ <dig> and rop <dig> based on sequence homology, though its presence does not appear to be universal among rhoptry kinases
 <cit> . we investigated the distinguishing features of nte-containing rhoptry kinases to determine whether other ropks may also contain the nte, and to look for additional conserved features that characterize this gene clade .

in addition to rop2/ <dig> and rop <dig>  we found significant matches in rop4/ <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  as expected, and also a number of additional subfamilies which appear to form a clade : rop <dig>  rop <dig> , rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop42/43/ <dig>  and the proposed rop <dig>  four proteins in the ropk-unique  category also showed evidence for nte homology: tgme49_ <dig> , also known as rop2l <dig> and previously identified as a pseudogene
 <cit> ; its orthologs tgveg_ <dig> and tggt1_054010; and the e. tenella protein eth_ <dig>  a small number of sites in the nte sequence region show strong conservation .

having identified the nte-bearing clade, we then compared this clade to all other identifid ropks to identify clade-specific residue conservation patterns. in the solved structures of rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  several of these distinctive sites in the nte clade are spatially located around the nte itself, primarily near the conserved β <dig> and α’ secondary structure elements. in rop <dig>  v <dig> and p <dig> in the β <dig> sheet β4- β4’ loop are positioned on either side of the β <dig> sheet of the nte, close to the conserved s244; in rop <dig>  the equivalent residues are v <dig> and q <dig>  in each of the solved crystal structures of rop <dig> , rop <dig>  and rop <dig> , the β <dig> sheet passes directly between these two side chains, suggesting a structural selective constraint in nte-bearing ropks.

three significantly contrasting sites in the e-helix may also have some bearing on the nte conformation or placement: h <dig> near the αe n-terminus, oriented toward the nte in the rop <dig> structure ; v <dig>  a small, nonpolar residue oriented toward the extended αd; and q <dig> in the middle of the αe helix, where in the rop <dig> structure it interacts with the backbone of the conserved g <dig> at the n-terminus of the nte α’ — though in the rop <dig> structure the equivalent residue is i <dig> which despite having the same orientation cannot form an identical interaction.

also in the αe helix, a hydrophobic residue , in place of a usually basic residue outside the nte clade, is oriented toward a helix which extends beyond the kinase c-terminus in the rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig> structures, previously described as the αh’ helix
 <cit> . though this short, weakly conserved region is difficult to detect by sequence analysis, the conservation of the hydrophobic residue in the αe helix and the presence of this helix in the available structures does suggest a correlation between the presence of the nte and c-terminal αh’ helix.

discussion
we classified the ropks into likely active kinases, likely pseudokinases, and predicted kinases that may be active, but with a noncanonical catalytic mechanism, based on differences in epk-conserved residues surrounding the atp binding pocket. our alignment shows that conserved residues in or near the key epk-conserved motifs, including the histidine of the canonical “hrd” motifs, are well aligned for each of these categories, so it is unlikely that the absence of the key aspartates in predicted pseudokinases is due to misalignment. structural investigation of the unusual motifs in noncanonical subfamilies rop <dig> and rop <dig> in t. gondii could reveal novel kinase mechanisms of activation, atp positioning and catalysis. relatedly, analysis of the equivalent motifs in the ropk pseudokinases could improve our understanding of pseudokinases in general.

our phylogenetic tree of ropk subfamilies revealed three specific clades of interest: the nte-bearing ropks, the only clade for which crystal structures have been solved or even homology models reliably constructed; an e. tenella-specific expansion of ropks; and the divergent, intron-bearing ropkls. notably, each of these clades contains both predicted active kinases and pseudokinases, indicating a pattern of evolution in which, in a parsimonious interpretation, pseudokinases repeatedly emerge from an ancestral state shared with active kinases, rather than a single or small number of expansions of pseudokinases.

we were unable to find conclusive published evidence that the ropkl proteins are indeed localized to the rhoptry during the tachyzoite stage of coccidians and expelled during invasion at the same time and through the same mechanism as other ropks. rop <dig> protein expression has been detected during the t. gondii tachyzoite stage
 <cit>  and the e. tenella merozoite stage 
 <cit> . signal peptides were predicted for rop <dig>  rop <dig> and bpk <dig>  but not rop <dig>  while the gene models of rop <dig> and rop <dig> contain a short or nonexistent n-tail to the kinase domain which could indicate a trunctated gene model. however, transcription levels across the cell cycle do not match the distinctive two-peaked pattern of t. gondii rhoptry proteins in any of the t. gondii ropkls
 <cit> ; the secretory organelle of bpk <dig> was not identified in the study that described the protein
 <cit> . our hmm profile search and gene trees indicated that the ropkl proteins show stronger sequence similarity to typical ropks than to any other characterized protein kinase family, leaving open the question of how deep their functional similarity goes.

a common theme we observe in structural features unique to the ropk family is the interaction between ropk-specific inserts or structural motifs, including the n-terminal extension , and conserved sites within the kinase domain that show contrasting selection in ropks. two regions in particular, the kinase hinge region surrounding the αc’ helix and and the dusulphide bridge at the end of the αf helix, suggest several possible functional or mechanistic consequences.

our observations in the ropk hinge region raise several hypotheses. the αc’ insert in the αc– β <dig> loop has possible structural analogues in other kinases. the vaccinia-related kinase  family has a similar insert which packs hydrophobically against the αe helix and was proposed to promote a closed conformation of the kinase domain in the pseudokinase vrk3
 <cit> ; the authors of that study suggested that related active kinases that retain the same feature would be constitutively active. comparison of the structure of vrk <dig>  to that of rop <dig>  indicates that the ropk-conserved site l396rop <dig>  may perform a similar role to the vrk3-conserved f296vrk <dig> in hydrophobically coupling the two lobes of the kinase domain. interestingly, the atp-bound and apo structures of the pseudokinase rop <dig> show very little overall conformational change
 <cit> . as another example, crystal structures of the yeast srpk protein sky <dig> conserve a short αc’ helix insert, and the flexibility of this region is indicated to be critical for interlobe closure
 <cit> . together with the ropk-specific conservation of prolines in the αc– β <dig> loop and linker, this could indicate the possibility that these differences modulate interlobe closure  in ropks.

another hypothesis regarding the function of the αc’ helix, not necessarily conflicting with the above hypothesis, is that it could serve as a binding interface or protein-protein interaction site. we observed that the αc’ helix does not pack hydrophobically against the n-lobe of the kinase domain in the available rop <dig> structures; instead, there appear to be water molecules in between 
 <cit> . the b-factors are somewhat higher than in the immediately surrounding areas, and the symmetry of the rop <dig> structure suggests that the insert may have been stabilized in this structure by crystal packing. given that the same region is disordered in the available rop <dig> structures, it appears possible that αc’ may be relatively flexible, capable of unfolding from the helical secondary structure into a mobile loop. for comparison, in vrk <dig>  a surface patch centered on the αc– αc’ region has been proposed as a binding site
 <cit> .

in the kinase c-lobe, a pair of ropk-conserved cysteines form a disulfide bridge between the end of the αf helix and the αg– αh loop, which is extended in most ropks. a conserved tryptophan adjacent to the αf cysteine packs hydrophobically against the αd and αe helices, which are also extended in ropks; thus the “wc” motif appears to couple both ropk inserts to the kinase c-lobe. notably, this stabilization occurs in the surface region of the protein that was identified as polymorphic between rop <dig> alleles in t. gondii <cit> , and was recently shown to be the interface of an interaction with the host  immunity-related gtpase  protein
 <cit> . reese et al. proposed an allosteric network involving the nte and αf helix to link the polymorphic surfaces in the c-lobe and kinase active site in rop5
 <cit> . the variability of this site in ropks may therefore be justified by its involvement in that network, which itself appears to be variable in ropks. we can hypothesize that, at least in rop <dig>  the increased structural stability provided by the wc motif in this region permits these subfamily-specific mutations to proliferate at this surface without compromising the folding or stability of the kinase c-lobe
 <cit> . this hypothesis assumes that the disulfide bridge is indeed maintained throughout the lifespan of the protein; while it appears as such in the available solved structures, we note that once the protein is inside the host cell, the cytosolic environment is not conducive to disulfide bond formation. the two cysteines involved are co-conserved in not only the pvm-associated rop <dig>  rop <dig>  rop <dig> and rop <dig>  but also rop <dig>  which has been shown to be localized to the host nucleus
 <cit> , among other ropks.

we also searched for sites that showed conservation specific to the nte-bearing ropk clade, rather than ropks as a whole. interestingly, only a small number of strongly contrasting sites emerged as specific to this clade. this could indicate that the mechanistic roles of the nte vary across even the nte-bearing clade of ropks.

more structural information will be essential to further understand the ropk family. currently, only ropks from the rop2/ <dig> and rop <dig> subfamilies within the nte clade have been solved
 <cit> . while these structures have been invaluable in understanding ropk mechanisms and possible functions, the low sequence identity and presence of indels across subfamilies makes it difficult to produce reliable homology models for ropk subfamilies outside this clade. we can suggest several important ropks outside the nte clade which appear to be active kinases, are highly expressed
 <cit> , and from which we could gain important insights from the solved crystal structure. rop <dig> was indirectly implicated in virulence differences between t. gondii strains in mice
 <cit> , and also shown to to modulate the host stat <dig> and stat <dig> pathway response
 <cit> , but the precise mechanisms of this action remain to be discovered. peixoto et al. <cit>  found evidence that rop <dig> is involved in modulating the mapk cascade; the rop19/29/ <dig> subfamily was also found to be independently duplicated in t. gondii and n. caninum, thus the other subfamily members could easily be modeled if a rop <dig> structure were available. finally, rop <dig> is a representative member of the divergent, poorly understood ropkl clade; the presence of several indels relative to other ropks at structurally important locations in the sequence suggest that a crystal structure would almost certainly reveal surprising variations on the epk fold and catalytic mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed novel bioinformatic methods to study patterns of diversification and neofunctionalization in the rhoptry kinase family, and integrated the results of a systematic, multi-species analysis with the structural context provided by the solved structures. our phylogenetic analysis revealed a subfamily-level structure shared across species, as well as lineage-specific expansions within the ropk family and three distinct sub-clades of ropk. we applied general knowledge of protein kinase mechanisms to categorize each rhoptry kinase as a likely active, likely pseudokinase, or potentially active but with an atypical catalytic mechanism. we determined the sequence and structural features that distinguish these subfamilies from each other, as well as those that distinguish the ropk family as a whole from typical epks. where possible, ropk-specific motifs were placed into structural context to develop functional hypotheses.

this work sheds light on several important but previously unrecognized features shared among rhoptry kinases, as well as the essential differences between active and degenerate protein kinases or pseudokinases. our studies provide specific hypothesis for further characterizing ropk structure and function and also inform ongoing efforts to design protein kinase inhibitors for global diseases caused by coccidian parasites.
