BACKGROUND
tactile adaptation temporally desensitizes the tactile sensory system after an exposure to sustained or repetitive tactile stimuli  <cit> . it has been reported that perceived intensity during tactile adaptation exponentially decreases over time at the psychophysical level  <cit> . in addition, the responses of mechanoreceptive afferents also exponentially decrease during tactile adaptation at the afferent level  <cit> . in line with these previous studies, the human brain activation would also exponentially decrease during tactile adaptation at the cortical level.

tactile adaptation on the cortex has been explored in a number of neurophysiologic studies. an optical intrinsic imaging study in non-human primate has demonstrated changes in cortical activation with a decrease in the spatial extent of the responses of the primary somatosensory cortex  during sustained vibrotactile stimulation   <cit> . recent human magnetoencephalography    <cit>  and functional magnetic resonance imaging    <cit>  studies have reported that activities of the somatosensory and parietal cortical regions decreased over time during repetitive vibrotactile stimuli. however, to our knowledge, no human study has explored tactile adaptation at the cortical level to sustained pressure stimulation, which would be manifested in exponential decreases in cortical activation. sa-i afferents deliver information of such low-frequency mechanical stimuli  to the somatosensory cortical regions  <cit>  for encoding sustained indentation  <cit> , tangential  <cit>  and grip forces  <cit> , sizes  <cit> , curvatures , position  <cit> , and torque direction  <cit>  during object manipulation. therefore, we hypothesize that the human brain would exhibit tactile adaptation at the cortical level along with the response profile of sa-i afferents to sustained pressure stimulation shown in the previous neurophysiologic studies  <cit> .

in the present study, we specifically focused on two aspects of cortical activities: temporal changes in cortical responses and inter-regional connectivity. first, we examined which regions  exhibited distinct changes in cortical activation during tactile adaptation. second, we used the functional connectivity analysis with blood oxygenation level-dependent  signals from multiple cortical regions. the functional connectivity analysis method used in this study has been widely used to examine inter-regional interactions in task- or resting-states  <cit>  as well as to characterize cortical networks in static mechanical stimulation  <cit> . although there is no existing study addressing how functional connectivity on the cortex changes during tactile adaptation, we ventured a hypothesis that functional connectivity over certain cortical regions associated with tactile perception would also adapt to sustained pressure stimulation.

methods
participants
we recruited  <dig> healthy volunteers  with no history of neurological disorders or deficits in tactile sensation. all participants gave written informed consent for this study approved by the korea university institutional review board .

pressure stimulation
we used a band-type mr compatible stimulation device developed by our group  <cit>  that was able to apply pressure of up to  <dig>  kpa . a neonatal cuff  was directly connected to a rolling pump in a blood pressure monitor  through an elastic air-tube with a length of 5 m and a diameter of 4 mm. the cuff wrapped an entire fingertip and was controlled by a pressure sensor for achieving uniform pressure. e-prime  <dig>  software  controlled the sensor to configure the length of stimulation. the cuff pressed the whole ventral surface of the fingertip by expanding through an air insertion when the pump was turned on. detailed information about this stimulation device can be found in kim et al.  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pressure stimulation device. a right index fingertip was placed on a neonatal cuff  and was wrapped by the cuff  before mr scanning. the cuff was expanded by air insertion at the turn-on of the pump in a blood pressure monitor  during mr scanning. in this way, a pressure stimulus of up to  <dig>  kpa was applied to the whole ventral surface of the right index fingertip for  <dig>   <dig>  or 15 s stimulation periods



during each scanning session, the participants were instructed to lie on the mri table comfortably and to close their eyes in order to prevent visual stimulation. during the entire scanning, the participants were requested to grab an emergency squeeze-ball weakly with their left hands. the squeeze-ball was not used for other purposes. the cuff wrapped the participants’ right index fingertip before scanning. it was confirmed that the cuff contacted the skin with no pressure so that participants verbally confirmed no perceived pressure before scanning and clearly perceived pressure during stimulation after each session. each participant performed a series of three experiments, where each experiment corresponded to pressure stimulation with each of three different stimulation durations:  <dig>   <dig>  or 15 s. an experiment consisted of four block-designed sessions where each session included four trials. a single trial was composed of a 21 s resting period followed by a  <dig>   <dig>  or 15 s stimulation period. during each stimulation period, a single static indentation was applied continuously to the participant’s right index fingertip.

data acquisition
we performed mr scanning using a 3t mri system  with a standard 32-channel head coil. t1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using a 3d magnetization-prepared gradient echo  sequence with the imaging parameters of repetition time  = 1900 ms, echo time  =  <dig>  ms, flip angle = 9°, field of view  = 200 mm, and voxel size =  <dig>  ×  <dig>  × 1 mm <dig>  t2*-weighted functional images were acquired using a gradient echo-planar imaging  sequence with the imaging parameters of tr = 3000 ms, te = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, fov = 240 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm, and voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm <dig> 

statistical analysis on fmri data
preprocessing of the functional images was conducted using spm <dig> . preprocessing included the ordered sequence of data processing: slice-timing correction, realignment with the rigid-body transformation matrices, normalization to the montreal neurological institute  template, and smoothing with an isotropic gaussian kernel of 8 mm full-width-half-maximum . the general linear model  in spm <dig> was used to perform a statistical analysis of the bold signals with a canonical hemodynamic response function as well as its time and dispersion derivatives. a 128 s high-pass filter removed physiological artifacts in the bold signals. to observe time-varying cortical activation, stimulus durations of  <dig> or 15 s were divided into three  or five stimulus segments  with a time interval of 3 s for the glm analysis. a random effects model was used to perform a group analysis for the inference of statistically significant cortical activations. cluster-level f statistics  produced group-level statistical parametric maps  representing significant voxel clusters. we obtained one, three, or five spms corresponding to individual stimulus segments in  <dig>   <dig>  or 15 s pressure stimulation, respectively. the automated anatomical labeling toolbox  <cit>  determined the anatomical cluster labels of activated regions in the spms.

we implemented independent one, three, and five design matrices for each condition of  <dig>   <dig> and 15 s simulation, respectively. in particular, we split the 15 s stimulus duration into five and the 9 s stimulus duration into three intervals in the glm specification to perform statistical evaluation of cortical activation. for the 15 s stimulation, we constructed five separated box-car stimulus functions with five different onsets at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 12 s for each stimulus interval. similarly, for the 9 s stimulation, we constructed three separated box–car stimulus functions with three different onsets at  <dig>   <dig>  and 6 s for each stimulus interval. each stimulus function was convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function with time and dispersion derivatives to perform statistical inferences . hence, cortical activation patterns from the first  to the last  stimulus intervals were analyzed using design matrices independently obtained by the separated stimulus functions.

the regressors of each stimulus interval  may be highly correlated with each other if they belong to the same design matrix due to slow dynamics of the hemodynamic response function. however, in our study, we constructed design matrices for individual stimulus intervals independently with the separated box-car stimulus functions . each design matrix contained only one type of regressor . our glm analysis for each stimulation event was then performed using each of these separated design matrices. consequently, we could avoid correlations between regressors in the glm.

regions of interests 
we used the anatomy toolbox   <cit>  to generate anatomical masks in nine rois relevant to tactile information processing. they included the contralateral brodmann area   <dig>  cba <dig>  and cba <dig> at si  <cit> ; cba40) and iba <dig> at sii  <cit> ; cba <dig> and iba <dig> at ppc neighboring on si  <cit>  known as the somatosensory association cortex  <cit> ; and cba <dig> and iba <dig> at the insula neighboring on sii  <cit> . the number of suprathreshold voxels in these rois  <  <dig> , k > 5) was used in the following generalized linear model analysis.

generalized linear model analysis
we built a generalized linear model  <cit>  to depict how the number of suprathreshold voxels in the rois decreased with time . to model a relationship between the number of suprathreshold voxels  and the stimulus duration , we used a log-linear function given as:  <dig> y=ce-=ce   <dig> ln=α0+α1t where c and α <dig> are constants. we implemented a log-linear model instead of a linear model because we assumed that cortical adaptation would represent exponential characteristics likewise psychophysical  <cit>  and afferent adaptation  <cit> . the inverse and negative of the coefficient α <dig> was equivalent to a time constant , representing a cortical adaptation rate. the statistical significance of the generalized linear model for each roi was evaluated using the f-test . additionally, we compared the goodness of fit of the results from the log-linear  and simple linear  functions.

functional connectivity
we used the conn toolbox   <cit>  to investigate functional connectivity during the pressure stimulation. realignment parameters selected as the first-level covariates were regressed out from the preprocessed functional images. confounds were removed based on the acompcor strategy  <cit> , including effects in white matter, cerebrospinal fluid , realignment parameters and their first temporal derivatives, and main session effects and their first temporal derivatives. bold time series were band-pass filtered  for removal of low-frequency drifts  <cit> . in the first-level analysis, we assessed functional connectivity among the nine rois defined above. roi–roi functional connectivity was measured by calculating an inter-regional bivariate correlation coefficient  between two bold signals and averaged over all the voxels in source and target rois. the averaged correlation coefficient value was then adjusted to a fisher-transformed correlation coefficient, i.e., atanh, with a false-discovery rate  corrected threshold of p <  <dig>  . after finding the correlation coefficients for all roi–roi pairs , we performed a linear regression analysis between the correlation coefficients  and the stimulus duration  in each pair as follows:  <dig> z=β0+β1t 

the statistical significance of the linear model for each roi–roi pair was evaluated using the f-test .

RESULTS
cortical activation

discussion
tactile adaptation on the cortex
we made two observations in the cortical activation patterns during tactile adaptation:  that the number of activated regions reduced from the diverse somatosensory regions to the contralateral postcentral gyrus  and  that the number of suprathreshold voxels of the contralateral si decreased.

the first result may indicate that cortical regions are refined during adaptation for efficient sensory processing by gradually excluding cortical activities of the regions that are more involved in initial comprehensive perception of tactile stimuli but leaving only the primary somatosensory region active to sustain a basic function for tactile detection. the second result may be explained by the following two possibilities. first, activation of the contralateral si becomes sharply tuned for stimulus detection by narrowing its spatial extent during adaptation, as illustrated in the sharpening model  <cit> . a previous optical intrinsic imaging study in monkeys reported that responses of forelimb regions in si became spatially sharper but stronger by suppressing their surroundings during sustained vibrotactile stimulation for 5 s  <cit> . although surrounding suppression was unobserved in our results, we conjecture its plausibility from a previous fmri study showing deactivation of the ipsilateral si and bilateral primary motor cortex during vibrotactile stimulation to the finger  <cit> . however, the sharpening model does not fully elucidate our results as we did not observe any temporal increase in activation levels  in the contralateral si. second, exponential decreases in the number of suprathreshold voxels of the contralateral si may be associated with rapid information transfer from si to other regions during adaptation  <cit> . consequently, responses of the contralateral si would be shortened, leading to a less number of activated voxels. this can also be supported by an increase in functional connectivity between the contralateral si and ppc observed in the present study.

our results showed exponential decreases in the number of suprathreshold voxels of the contralateral si  and sii  during 15 s pressure stimulation. these exponential decays in the contralateral si and sii are similar to those in sa-i afferent adaptation  <cit>  during sustained pressure stimulation. the response rate of the contralateral sii was much lower  than that of the contralateral si. in terms of a hierarchical somatosensory network for tactile information processing from si  to sii   <cit> , it is likely that these adaptive changes in the degrees of activation occurs in the contralateral si earlier than in the contralateral sii. other regions beyond the contralateral sii including the ipsilateral sii, bilateral ppc and insula showed no significant adaptive change in the degree of activation. it implies that cortical regions for earlier tactile processing  <cit>  are apt to be foci during tactile adaptation.

functional connectivity during tactile adaptation
the functional connectivity analysis revealed three findings:  that inter-hemispheric  and ipsilateral  functional connectivity linearly decreased,  that contralateral  functional connectivity linearly increased, and  that contralateral  functional connectivity within si linearly decreased.

the first finding is supported by previous fmri studies in humans about a task-specific hemispheric dominance in tactile perception. it has been reported that the left hemisphere was dominantly involved in grating orientation  <cit> , shape encoding  <cit> , and the discrimination of vibrotactile frequency  <cit>  while the right hemisphere was dominantly involved in grating location  <cit> , shape matching  <cit> , tactile pattern  <cit> , and kinesthetic processing  <cit> . as a simple static pressure was consistently applied to the same location for 15 s in our study, high-level tactile perceptual processes such as identifying tactile locations might become less active by adaptation-induced learning  <cit> . hence, transmission of tactile information for stimulus location to/from the right  somatosensory cortex might decay over time. this is consistent with our observation of decreases in functional connectivity primarily with the ipsilateral sii: between the ipsilateral sii and contralateral si, between the ipsilateral sii and bilateral insula, and between the ipsilateral sii and ipsilateral ppc  <cit> .

the second finding is associated with the roles of ppc in high-level tactile information processing  <cit>  and the anatomical evidence showing dense sensory projections from si to ba <dig>  <cit> . note that the ppc alone did not exhibit any significant activation during tactile stimulation, but its connectivity to si appeared to be enhanced during adaptation. from this, we speculate that increased connectivity between si and ppc might rather reflect increased efficiency in somatosensory information transmission during adaptation than increases in high-level information processing of ppc. it may also indicate that information processing becomes more efficient during tactile adaptation, passing the information from cba <dig>  directly to cba <dig> without much intermediate processes. this speculation is also supported by the third finding showing decreased connectivity between cba <dig> and cba <dig> within si so that more efficient information transmission from cba <dig> to cba <dig> is made possible. taken together, we postulate that the human somatosensory cortex adaptively adjusts both low- and high-level tactile perception processes during sustained pressure stimulation by changing the strength of inter-regional functional connectivity.

adaptation of cortical activity in this study may be considered as an extension of the response profile at the afferent level in the peripheral nervous system, sharing a similar property such as exponentially decaying responses. however, we suspect that it may not be a mere reflection of afferent adaptation because of two distinct spatiotemporal properties: time constants  of adaptation and changes in inter-regional interaction. first, we found that τ values at the contralateral si were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  s at ba <dig>  ba <dig>  and ba <dig>  respectively. while the average τ value over these si sub-regions  was similar to the afferent time constant , individual sub-regions showed their own time constants which were apparently different from the afferent time constant. second, changes in the firing activity of the peripheral afferents may not fully explain the adaptive changes in inter-regional functional connectivity at the cortical level. region-specific variations  in functional connectivity during sustained pressure stimulation can be considered as distinct adaptive behavior of somatosensory cortical activity. these spatiotemporal properties imply that adaptation of cortical activity may represent specific neural mechanisms dealing with inputs from adaptive sensory afferents. however, further studies are warranted to unveil precise relationships between afferent and cortical activity patterns during tactile adaptation.

limitations and future work
in line with previous non-fmri neuroimaging and neurophysiologic studies on the cortical responses during tactile adaptation , we studied how cortical activity adaptively changed during pressure stimulation by investigating the degrees of cortical activation and inter-regional functional connectivity using fmri. the following research topics, however, should be pursued in future work to fully corroborate our findings, which includes long-term adaptation, complexity of tactile stimulation , and correlations between cortical activation patterns and individual perceptual sensitivity during tactile adaptation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we investigated changes in human cortical activity to sustained pressure stimuli using fmri. during pressure stimulation lasting for 15 s, we found  that the number of suprathreshold voxels of the contralateral si and sii exponentially decreased with time and  that inter- and intra-hemispheric inter-regional functional connectivity over the regions associated with tactile perception linearly decreased or increased with time. in particular, functional connectivity between the ipsilateral sii and other several regions decreased whereas functional connectivity between the contralateral ba  <dig> and  <dig> increased. in addition, functional connectivity between the contralateral ba  <dig> and  <dig> decreased. these findings suggest that cortical activation and inter-regional interactions adaptively changed during tactile adaptation for efficient tactile information processing.
