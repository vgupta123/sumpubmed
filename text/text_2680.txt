BACKGROUND
as molecular genetics technology advances, marker-assisted selection and quantitative trait locus  analysis are being routinely performed in crop genetics research. consequently, results such as the isolation of key genes and molecular breeding have been achieved in several species, including rice  <cit> . although the use of dna markers has become a powerful tool for crop breeding, the approach has problems that must be resolved, such as the extremely low levels of dna polymorphism that are often found among closely related rice cultivars, which has made it difficult to use dna markers in genetic analysis. for example, several types of dna markers with high levels of polymorphism between indica and japonica cultivars have been reported, but the level of polymorphism within japonica is low  <cit> . however, despite this low level of dna polymorphism, wide phenotypic diversity is believed to exist  <cit> . this diversity is the major source of variation that has been targeted in breeding programs for rice improvement. therefore, more robust methods to detect sequence polymorphisms among japonica accessions must be developed to help breeders and researchers understand the source of the phenotypic variations.

single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most frequent polymorphisms in the genomes of most organisms. since the rice genome was recently sequenced with high accuracy using a japonica cultivar, nipponbare  <cit> , comprehensive detection of snps using the nipponbare sequence as a reference has become an effective tool. thus far, whole-genome detection of snps has been carried out by comparisons between nipponbare and an indica line, 93- <dig>  <cit> . however, the degree of polymorphism in snp markers is still low within temperate japonica cultivars  <cit> . this has been caused by a shortage of an absolute quantity of sequences to be compared. recently, high-throughput sequencers such as the gs flx system , the solexa genome analyzer , and the solid system  have enabled researchers to produce sequences of more than  <dig> mb and as high as several gb per run  <cit> , and have thus been used for resequencing, transcriptome, and epigenetic analysis, among other analyses . in fact, the detection of genome-wide snps in eukaryotes using high-throughput resequencing has been reported for the human, nematode, arabidopsis, and rice genomes  <cit> .

the process of crossing and selection during plant breeding has resulted in the recombination and shuffling of ancestral chromosome blocks  to create new variation. the identification of such haplotypes in developed cultivars provides valuable information to support further improvement of rice and other crops. researchers have attempted to define such haplotypes in rice using several types of dna markers  <cit> , but owing to technical limitations, fine-scale definition of pedigree haplotypes based on a large number of dna markers has not yet been performed. in this context, snps identified by means of high-throughput genotyping based on array technology could be a useful tool  <cit> . such large-scale, genome-wide snp typing in barley has revealed the genetic constitution of old landraces and modern cultivars  <cit> . two independent technological innovations, the high-throughput sequencer and hybridization arrays, have provided a new opportunity to determine the historical flow of pedigree haplotypes during the breeding of rice cultivars.

in this study, we attempted to identify genome-wide snps in closely related rice cultivars. to do so, we first completed a whole-genome sequence of a temperate japonica rice cultivar, koshihikari, which is both the most popular cultivar in japan and closely related to nipponbare. after in silico mapping of numerous consensus reads against the pseudomolecules for nipponbare, we carried out comprehensive detection of genome-wide snps between the two cultivars. in addition, we applied an array-based snp detection system to  <dig> representative japanese japonica rice cultivars, and were able to define haplotype blocks and trace their inheritance during rice breeding in japan, even though these cultivars were closely related. these results revealed the changes in genetic diversity in particular chromosomal regions during the long history of rice breeding in japan. this information and the tools developed will provide new opportunities to establish selection criteria for the breeding of rice and other crop species.

RESULTS
in silico mapping of the solexa reads to the reference rice genome
we mapped a large number of short reads of the koshihikari genome onto the nipponbare genome and assembled them into a consensus sequence . a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> uniquely mapped koshihikari reads corresponded to  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> bp  of the genome . the sequence depth of the koshihikari reads varied from  <dig> × the genome on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> × on chromosome  <dig>  and averaged  <dig> × across the genome. the mapped reads were almost equally distributed , and covered  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> bp  of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> bp of the nipponbare genome  <cit> . the koshihikari consensus genome was composed of  <dig>  <dig> contigs, with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> bp, and averaging  <dig> bp. contigs shorter than  <dig> bp accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the total . about  <dig>  mb of the nipponbare genome was not covered by the short koshihikari reads. these sequences could be classified into three main categories:  <dig>  mb  comprised retrotransposons or short duplicated repeats,  <dig>  mb  were regions in which undefined bases  dominated in the nipponbare reference genome, and  <dig> kb  were regions showing homology with the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. in addition,  <dig> kb  were sequences for which koshihikari short reads could not be mapped, probably due to multiple snps and insertion-deletions .

detection and distribution of snps between koshihikari and nipponbare
we detected a total of  <dig>  <dig> snps between koshihikari and nipponbare . although the average snp density was  <dig> per  <dig>  kb, the density varied among the chromosomes , from 1/ <dig>  kb  on chromosome  <dig> to 1/ <dig>  kb  on chromosome  <dig>  moreover, the distributions of the snps were uneven within a chromosome ; for example, there were  <dig> high-density regions with > <dig>  snps/kb, including  <dig> snps in  <dig> - <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> snps in 27- <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  we randomly selected  <dig> snps from all chromosomes for validation. of these, we confirmed  <dig> snps using the traditional sanger method using a capillary sequencer, indicating a high level of reliability in snp detection.

to determine the optimal sampling effort by means of high-throughput sequencing to obtain as many genome-wide snps as possible, we simulated the relationships among sequencing depth, genome coverage, and number of snps detected . as the sequence depth increased to 10× the genome, both the genome coverage and the number of snps detected increased. however, although the number of snps increased as the sequencing depth increased to 15×, genome coverage did not improve. this suggests that a 10× sequencing depth should be sufficient to detect snps distributed throughout the genome for alignment based on short reads.

a snp in the coding sequence for a gene occasionally causes non-synonymous amino acid substitution, leading to a decrease or loss of functional activity of the transcripts. we aligned the detected snps with the annotated rap <dig> nipponbare full-length cdna database  <cit>  to investigate whether these snps might affect the function of the gene products. of  <dig> snps that occurred in  <dig> genes,  <dig> snps  in  <dig> genes  were non-synonymous, whereas  <dig> snps  in  <dig> genes  were synonymous, and  <dig> genes  included both synonymous and non-synonymous changes. it also appears that  <dig> and  <dig> snps, respectively, resulted in internal termination codons in the koshihikari and nipponbare alleles. this data is available at http://koshigenome.dna.affrc.go.jp/.

definition of genome-wide pedigree haplotypes of the japanese rice cultivars by means of snp array analysis
we selected  <dig> representative rice cultivars that have been grown during the past  <dig> years from japanese landrace and cultivar collections . since these cultivars are breeding lines and are therefore not appropriate for biological classification such as by population structure analysis , we roughly classified them into three groups based on the year in which they were developed. group  <dig> consists of  <dig> landraces and two cultivars that were grown from the late 1800s to about  <dig>  group  <dig> includes  <dig> cultivars that were developed from  <dig> to  <dig>  when high yield was the major objective of breeding programs. the last  <dig> cultivars  are recent cultivars that were developed from  <dig> to  <dig>  when the breeding objective changed from high yield to good eating quality. by processing the genotype data for  <dig> snps , we defined the genome compositions of all the cultivars based on whether the alleles were similar to those of koshihikari , nipponbare , or neither . the frequencies of the koshihikari type tended to increase in most of the recent cultivars  compared with older cultivars. all the cultivars could be distinguished from the others except for the pair of fujiminori  and reimei , the latter of which was developed by means of gamma-irradiation mutagenesis of the former.

hitomebore , akitakomachi , and hinohikari  are the second, third, and fourth most-grown cultivars in japan, and were developed by crossing with koshihikari , as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure 3b shows the genomic segments inherited from koshihikari in these three cultivars. the proportions of the koshihikari genome present in these three varieties were estimated to be  <dig> % in hitomebore,  <dig> % in akitakomachi, and  <dig> % in hinohikari. in total,  <dig> regions of conserved haplotype blocks, accounting for about  <dig> % of the total genome, were also observed among the four cultivars . in particular,  <dig> consensus haplotype blocks longer than  <dig> mb from six landraces were predicted .

changes in genome diversity during modern rice breeding
we used the number of haplotypes per unit of genomic region estimated by the sliding-window approach as an index of genome diversity. the window size is ideally considered to be the same as the length of the haplotype block estimated by linkage disequilibrium . we calculated that the ld decay was  <dig> mb , which was higher than previously reported values in rice  <cit> . we suggest two reasons:  the breeding population has been highly structured by strong selection pressure.  japanese cultivars with extremely high genetic similarity share segments inherited from the same ancestor. so we simulated the number of haplotypes by changing the window size around 10-snps, which was equivalent to  <dig> mb . the changes in the number of haplotypes showed distinct differences among the three groups of cultivars, suggesting that a 10-snp window is appropriate. however, since a small number of snps led to a long 10-snp window  on chromosome  <dig> , we excluded this chromosome from further analysis. the mean physical length of the 10-snp window ranged from  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> 

the total number of haplotypes on chromosome  <dig>  was significantly higher than on the other chromosomes . the highest densities were observed in regions of  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> . on the other hand, small regions with relatively low haplotype number  were also observed, including regions of  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> 

groups  <dig> and  <dig> tended to have fewer haplotypes than group  <dig> at either the entire chromosome level  or the chromosome-region level. most of the regions showed a decreased number of haplotypes in group  <dig>  but several regions showed decreases in both group  <dig> and group  <dig>  such as in regions of  <dig> - <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  however, we also observed regions where haplotype numbers increased from group  <dig> to group  <dig>  of these, the number of haplotypes in three chromosomal regions  might not be reliable because of the low snp density. however, those in three regions  are reliable because they were based on a high snp density.

discussion
whole-genome resequencing for comprehensive snp detection
ossowski et al.  <cit>  reported that 87% of the total arabidopsis reference genome was covered by solexa reads. however, no similar study of rice had been reported. we found that  <dig> % of the rice reference genome  was covered by solexa reads derived from a closely related cultivar, koshihikari . our preliminary in silico mapping indicated that  <dig> % of the 35-bp split-genome sequence of nipponbare chromosome  <dig> was uniquely mapped to the corresponding region of the nipponbare genome , showing good agreement with the genome coverage. despite the high level of genome coverage,  <dig>  <dig> contigs  were less than  <dig> bp long ; this is unavoidable because of the short reads generated by the high-throughput sequencer. the lack of coverage of some regions was caused by large changes in chromosomal structure and therefore loss of contiguousness, but most omissions were due to unmapped reads with multiple snps, conserved domains, repeat sequences, or small indels, which must be filled in after future advances in sequencing technology.

though we mapped the solexa reads at an average sequencing depth of  <dig> ×, the depth varied among genomic regions. small chromosomal regions that were not covered well by the koshihikari reads were found on all chromosomes . a region with lower depth that measured  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> was consistent with a cluster of retrotransposons . however, we could not fully explain the lower depth of the small chromosomal regions. some cases might be explained by heterochromatic and repetitive regions  <cit>  or by chromosome segment duplication  <cit> . the relationship between sequencing depth and efficacy in the comprehensive detection of snps is a key concern from the perspective of cost-effectiveness. although the optimal sequencing depth depends on the study objectives, our data suggest that a sequencing depth of at least 10× would be necessary to discover genome-wide snps for use in haplotype analysis . smith et al.  <cit>  reported that the redundancy resulting from increasing the sequencing depth from 10× to 15× permits accurate and cost-effective detection of polymorphisms using the solexa analyzer. our results clearly support their conclusion.

distributions of the detected snps between closely related rice cultivars
we detected  <dig>  <dig> snps between koshihikari and nipponbare , with an average density of  <dig>  kb/snp. in previous comparisons between indica and japonica, the densities were  <dig>  kb/snp in a  <dig> -mb region on chromosome  <dig> between gla <dig> and nipponbare  <cit> , and  <dig>  kb/snp across the whole genome between 93- <dig> and nipponbare  <cit> . the density of snps between the japanese cultivars in the present study was 1/6th to 1/21st those in the previous reports, which may reflect sequence divergence among the varietal combinations used in the analysis. recently, a genome-wide resequencing analysis of  <dig> diverse indica and japonica cultivars  <cit>  demonstrated that the average snp density between two temperate japonica cultivars, nipponbare and m <dig>  was  <dig>  kb/snp . monna et al.  <cit>  reported a diversity analysis among nine rice accessions, including koshihikari and nipponbare, by means of sanger sequencing of  <dig> intergenic regions. of these,  <dig> sites showed polymorphism between the two cultivars, and were distributed unevenly throughout the genome. we detected a large number of snps in regions that did not show any polymorphism, indicating the potential power of the present approach for snp discovery even among closely related rice cultivars. however, we still identified extremely low numbers of snps in several chromosomal regions, such as in  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  in  <dig> to  <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig>  and in  <dig>  to  <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> . it is very likely that these chromosomal regions are conserved between koshihikari and nipponbare, because they share a common ancestral cultivar , and thus probably share a common chromosomal segment. this would make these regions unsuitable sources of snps for use as dna markers. to overcome the uneven distribution of snps, we are collecting additional snp sets to fill the gaps by whole-genome sequencing of japanese cultivars distantly related to koshihikari and nipponbare. on the other hand, wang et al.  <cit>  defined numerous genomic regions with low frequency of snps among rice cultivars as "snp deserts", and suggested that they might be a result of rice domestication. some of the regions with low frequencies of snps, such as on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  at 10- <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> and at 10- <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> , overlap with these deserts, and may be legacies of domestication.

definition of the pedigree haplotype
genome-wide snp typing has been a powerful method for revealing the genomic constitutions of closely related lines or cultivars  <cit> . huang et al.  <cit>  proposed a new method of high-throughput genotyping and estimation of recombination points based on whole-genome resequencing of recombinant inbred lines. even though the coverage of sequence reads throughout the genome was not enough , their method provided useful results. however, this method can only be applied with cultivars whose genome sequences have been decoded, and that makes it difficult to apply their approach with a large set of independent lines or cultivars. to overcome this limitation, we performed a two-step analysis, with genome-wide snp detection followed by array-based genome-wide snp typing. based on the relatively high sequencing depth, we detected a large number of snps between two cultivars  that are representative of the population being analyzed. we then developed a typing array consisting of  <dig> snp sites, and applied it to  <dig> representative cultivars from japanese rice breeding history over the past  <dig> years . even though the snp density was insufficient in some regions of the chromosomes, we successfully defined distinct haplotypes.

definition of the pedigree haplotypes enabled us to discriminate between almost all of the  <dig> cultivars, and to thereby gain insights into the changes in genome composition that have occurred during the history of modern rice breeding. our analysis revealed that these breeding practices have clearly simplified the genome composition. furthermore, we clearly demonstrated that the koshihikari genome is dominant in certain regions of the chromosomes in the most recently bred cultivars. this dominance by the koshihikari genome is not surprising, because koshihikari has frequently been used as a parental line during cultivar development . this information will be useful to guide future cross-breeding using recent japanese cultivars, since it will allow breeders to avoid redundant haplotypes in crossing designs and will facilitate the selection of genotypes in the progeny of each cross combination.

we successfully identified  <dig> consensus haplotype blocks longer than  <dig> mb in koshihikari, hitomebore, akitakomachi, and hinohikari , which together account for about 65% of the total area of rice cultivation in japan  <cit> . furthermore, these haplotype blocks could be assigned to genomic regions of the ancestral landraces. these highly conserved regions are the consequence of selection during modern rice breeding, and may be an essential identifying characteristic of recent japanese rice cultivars. currently, we have not yet developed any annotations for these haplotype blocks. from a biological point of view, it will be necessary to clarify the relationship between haplotype conservation and recombination frequency or physical structure of chromosomes. from a rice breeding point of view, it will be necessary to clarify the association between particular haplotypes and phenotypic differences. we have recently developed reciprocal chromosomal-segment-substitution lines between nipponbare and koshihikari  <cit> . these plant materials will be invaluable for the genetic analysis of phenotypic traits that are of economic interest.

changes in haplotype diversity during modern rice breeding
it has been reported that genetic diversity, based on the estimated genetic distances among several rice ecotypes, is decreasing in modern rice cultivars  <cit> . we clearly demonstrated that the haplotype number has been decreased by breeding practices , supporting this idea. in barley, rostoks et al.  <cit>  analyzed chromosomal haplotype diversity using  <dig> snps based on genome-wide expressed sequence tag information. they suggested that chromosome 6h is highly diverse throughout the cultivar group. in rice, chromosome  <dig> showed a higher level of diversity than the other chromosomes . interestingly, rice chromosome  <dig> has a syntenic relationship with barley chromosome 6h. there is limited information on the association between genes located in those genomic regions and phenotypic variation in traits of agronomic or economic interest. thus, it is difficult to speculate about the source of this high level of diversity. this observation may nonetheless provide a new opportunity to investigate whether the same form of selective sweep during breeding has occurred in two or more related crop species such as rice and barley.

genetic diversity was relatively low  in several chromosomal regions in all three groups, such as in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> . this suggests that there may have been genetic bottlenecks during differentiation of the japanese landraces. it will be interesting to learn whether this low level of genetic diversity is present in those genomic regions in other japonica rice accessions. it would also be interesting to perform new introgression in these regions from the genomes of distantly related cultivars during breeding. in contrast, relatively highly variable regions  were identified in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and in  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  because of their high variability, these regions are not likely to have been adversely affected by selection pressure during breeding. we therefore hypothesize that there are no genes of economic value in these chromosomal regions. alternatively, intense recombination might have occurred in these chromosomal regions during breeding.

the number of haplotypes may have decreased from group  <dig>  to group  <dig>  in chromosomal regions such as those measuring  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  this may be an example of decreasing genetic diversity in a particular chromosomal region as a result of breeding. this decrease might be due to the change in breeding strategy from a focus on high yield to a focus on grain and cooking quality. in fact, the short arm of chromosome  <dig> contains major qtls related to flowering time  <cit>  and the waxy gene, which may contribute to grain quality  <cit> , and several qtls that control grain quality are located in the middle of chromosome  <dig> .

we detected regions in which the number of haplotypes increased from group  <dig> to group  <dig>  such as in  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  in  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and in  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  suggesting that a new haplotype block might have been created by selection during breeding. one possible explanation is that this occurred by strong selection of two loci that become tightly linked during the repulsion phase. for example, major qtls for eating quality  have been mapped in a region of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a major qtl related to germination ability at low temperature  was identified in this region  <cit> . it therefore seems reasonable to hypothesize that the new haplotype was created as a result of selection for a combination of eating quality and germination ability. further analysis will be required to prove that this type of strong selection pressure occurred during rice breeding.

toward next-generation breeding based on haplotype selection
the haplotypes of modern rice cultivars are the results of combinations of haplotypes inherited from ancestral landraces. therefore, some of the haplotype blocks that remain in group  <dig> might have been selected by breeders, either consciously or unconsciously. once we reveal the relationships between the haplotype blocks and phenotypic changes in future research, it should become possible to develop ideal combinations of haplotype blocks . based on the densely mapped snp information from the present study, it will be possible to design disruption and reconstruction of existing consensus haplotype blocks  <cit>  to generate novel haplotype blocks with new variations . on the other hand, excessive inbreeding has generally resulted in homogenization of the genome, thereby decreasing genetic diversity and creating a more uniform genome pattern in autogamous crop plants such as rice and wheat. to enhance the potential utility of the haplotype information revealed in this study, genome or haplotype shuffling should be carefully considered in future rice breeding.

to facilitate this process, the introduction of new approaches in breeding, such as recurrent selection to generate dynamic whole-genome recombination  <cit>  and genomic selection  <cit>  will be needed. in these new approaches, genome-wide snp discovery and whole-genome snp typing will be indispensable tools. our results in the present study will therefore open the door for next-generation breeding in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
detection of genome-wide snps by both high-throughput sequencer and typing array made it possible to evaluate genomic composition of genetically related rice varieties. with the aid of their pedigree information, we clarified the dynamics of chromosome recombination during the historical rice breeding process. we also found several genomic regions of decreasing diversity which might be caused by a recent human selection in rice breeding. the definition of pedigree haplotypes by means of genome-wide snps analysis will facilitate next-generation breeding of rice and other crops.
