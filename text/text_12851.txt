BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding sequences of rna, approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides long, which play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to complementary regions of messenger transcripts to repress their translation or regulate degradation  <cit> . this regulation appears to be involved in many fundamental cellular processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, stress response, fat metabolism and insulin secretion  <cit> . although the total number of different mirna sequences in humans might approach  <dig> based on the estimation of computer simulations  <cit> , only  <dig> to  <dig> of them have been studied on fresh or snap-frozen samples to date. to discover the full regulatory impact of mirna species and to understand individual biological functions within disease settings, larger scale analysis needs to be performed in a robust and reliable manner.

formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded  tissue samples are the most readily available archival material. they generally may be retrieved with documented clinico-pathological histories. thus they represent an invaluable source for the study of human disease. however, these tissues have not been widely used in molecular biology due to the poor quality of rna extracted from ffpe blocks  <cit>  which is degraded to fewer than  <dig> bases in length  <cit>  and also chemically modified by methylol groups during formalin fixation  <cit> . thus, the value of ffpe materials in molecular setting has been shadowed by the technical difficulties limiting extensive analysis of gene expression. interestingly, mirnas are a class of small rnas whose survivability and expression level in ffpe blocks compared with fresh tissues are largely unknown.

in this study we examined the reliability of mirna detection in formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks by interrogation of  <dig> mirna assays in paired rna extracts from fresh and ffpe samples using a cell line model.

RESULTS
rna extraction
to achieve  <dig> ng of total rna for each rt reaction,  <dig>  ng of total rna  was extracted from approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> of ffpe cells and from approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> snap frozen cells. analysis using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyser showed that the rna integrity number  was  <dig>  for the snap frozen cell preparations and  <dig>  for the corresponding ffpe preparation.

mirna expression
there was a good correlation of mirna expression pattern in between ffpe and snap frozen cells, with r <dig> >  <dig>  . the mean of Δcts was - <dig> . the median of Δcts was - <dig> ,  with p <  <dig> . the sign test of median showed that mirna exhibited approximately two fold higher expression with the total rna extracted from the ffpe cells than that extracted from the snap frozen cells.

 <dig> % of ΔΔcts , were between + <dig> and - <dig>  furthermore the abundance of some individual mirnas changed in ffpe cells with a total of  <dig> mirnas displaying increased expression and  <dig> mirnas decreased expression .

discussion
since their discovery, mirna analysis has generally been performed on snap-frozen or fresh samples, using variable techniques including microarray, northern blot analysis and pcr  <cit> . ffpe tissues, as a readily available source, could be invaluable in performing mirna expression analysis if their expression were maintained following processing. in this study we compared mirna profiling performed on fresh samples and ffpe using stem-loop rt-pcr quantification techniques in a cell line model. we found that mirna profiling could be performed on routinely fixed ffpe blocks.

mirna abundance in ffpe
some laboratories have examined mrna gene expression profiles using real-time rt-pcr in paired snap-frozen and ffpe tissue samples  <cit> . the general consensus is that mrna detection from archival material is limited due to the labile nature of mrna and the deleterious effects of enzymatic fragmentation during long periods of storage and rna modification induced by formalin fixation. subsequently, it has been suggested that small amplicons  <cit>   could have utility as robust markers in gene expression studies using ffpe tissues. indeed, our own experiments  confirmed this phenomenon using mrna targets over a range of amplicon sizes in this cell line model. for example, ffpe extracts produced cts  <dig> to  <dig> cycles higher than their snap frozen counterparts depending on the amplicon sizes used . cts between ffpe and snap frozen were closer for small amplicons than that for large amplicons. for example analysis of gapdh using a target amplicon of  <dig> bp displayed a mean difference of  <dig>  cycles, whereas an assay designed for the same gene  using a target amplicon size of  <dig> bp displayed a mean difference of  <dig>  cts between ffpe and snap frozen material.

mirnas have the advantage of small size, being only approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides long. in addition, they are protein protected by the risc complex. consequently they may not be as susceptible to rna degradation as mrna in ffpe tissues. our results showed that the amount of mirna in total rna extracted from ffpe was greater than that extracted from snap frozen cells when the input amounts of total rna were identical. the average quantity of mirnas derived from total rna extracted from ffpe was double  that in snap frozen cells which is most likely a consequence of methylol cross-links between rna and protein introduced during processing.

we extracted identical quantities of total rna  for analysis. in practical terms this required input of almost ten times the number of ffpe cells  compared to snap frozen . this difference in extracted yields was consistent with previous reports. this suggests the amount of rna that can be extracted from ffpe tissue represents only a fraction of that which is obtainable from fresh-frozen tissue  <cit> . the residual cross-links in every rna molecule that have not been removed by proteinase k digestion prevent this rna being extracted . the longer an rna molecule is, the greater the likelihood that a cross-link still exists after the proteinase k digestion procedure. therefore, small rna molecules are more amenable to extraction than larger mrna molecules resulting to a higher expression of mirna in ffpe compared to that in snap frozen.

reliability of mirna in ffpe
it is plausible to anticipate that mirna species are less susceptible to rna degradation associated with tissue processing than occurs with mrna, and this formed the hypothesis to be tested in this study. we found a good correlation of mirna expression levels between ffpe and snap frozen cells with r <dig> >  <dig> . our data demonstrated that, for majority of mirnas, the expression in ffpe is comparable with snap frozen cells.  <dig> % of mirnas displayed ΔΔcts in a range between +/- <dig> indicating that these normalized profiles were essentially identical between the two samples.

however, there was some outlying data where there was poor correlation between expression profiles for the paired snap-frozen and ffpe samples. the most significant of these was mir- <dig> with decreased expression and mir-302b* with increased expression. these changes could possibly occur during formalin fixation procedure or could also be caused by post fixation handling. mir- <dig> overexpression has been found in ptc tissues  <cit>  and was also suggested to be involved in cellular stress  <cit>  and innate immune responses  <cit> . interestingly, we found it was decreased in ffpe extracted nthy-ori cells. for those overexpressed mirnas, it is possible that precursors of mirna might have been cleaved by rnase to produce positive signals because ffpe blocks are often stored at room temperature in the absence of an rnase free environment. alternatively, increased cellular stress following harvesting and during the fixation process may have contributed to the altered expression patterns in specific mirnas. in these cases, the ffpe material could still be used to compare relative mirna expression patterns if a series of known blocks were fixed and handled simultaneously or in the same manner.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed  <dig> mirnas expression levels in freshly fixed ffpe by comparing to snap frozen in a cell line model. although the rna extracted from ffpe blocks is often compromised, we demonstrated the robustness of mirna profiles in ffpe material which could provide a source of study material for large scale or retrospective studies. this study has confirmed the proof of principle that mirna species may be successfully extracted and analysed from archival sources. further work may be required to determine precise effects of ffpe on mirna expression profiles across different tissue samples.
