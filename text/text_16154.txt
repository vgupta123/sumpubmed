BACKGROUND
stimulated by the human genome project and the need to further understand species genome architecture, more divergent mammals are being sequenced  <cit> , providing more complete and detailed comparative genomic information, and contributing to our understanding of mammalian genome evolution.

marsupials are a particularly interesting lineage of mammals, being only distantly related to eutherian  mammals such as human and mouse. they have many major features common to all mammals, such as bearing fur and suckling young, but they show many unique characteristics in reproduction, lactation, sex determination and immunology  <cit> . marsupials last shared a common ancestor with eutherians about  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , an evolutionary distance sufficient to exclude the conservation of most non-functional sequence, but not too wide to lose the conservation of most functional sequence  <cit> .

two marsupial genomes have been sequenced to date, representing lineages of marsupials living in south america and australia that diverged about  <dig> mya  <cit> . the brazilian opossum  was sequenced with more than 7× coverage in  <dig>  <cit> . the australian model kangaroo, the tammar wallaby , has recently been sequenced at about 2× coverage  <cit> . the first version  of the tammar wallaby assembly, released in december  <dig>  comprised relatively small contigs  and scaffolds , consistent with the relatively low coverage. in july  <dig>  ensembl released its annotation of these segments  <cit> , but there remains insufficient genome structure information to enable any of these sequence segments to be assembled onto m. eugenii chromosomes.

the situation is comparable to that of genomes of other species sequenced at low coverage. sequence  of the domestic cat   <cit>  was assembled first by reconstituting cat contigs on the basis of their alignment with the dog assembly, then aligning these revised contigs with a cat radiation hybrid  map. although this approach was productive, it largely neglected other cat mapping resources such as the cat linkage map. the sheep genome, too, has been sequenced to approximately 2× coverage   <cit> . in this species, great use was made of sheep bac-end sequences , which were assembled in a consensus manner based on their alignments to cattle, human and dog sequence assemblies. a virtual sheep genome was then created by transferring relevant human assembly segments onto the consensus alignment of sheep bes  <cit> .

in a non-model, non-domestic species such as the tammar wallaby, there are insufficient bes available for the creation of a consensus alignment, and no closely related species with which to align. however, there are considerable gene mapping data available from long-running efforts to produce a linkage map and a fish-based physical map of this species  <cit> , although there is no rh map. we therefore used all the available tammar wallaby mapping data to create an integrated map, using the location database  tool.

ldb is a bioinformatics tool first created to integrate all available human maps into a single map before the human sequence assembly was available  <cit> . inputs can include linkage maps , rh maps  and fluorescent in situ hybridisation  data . the output is a single map comprising the loci from all of the input data. each locus is allocated a cm, cr and cytological band location, even if it has actually been mapped using only one of these methods. most importantly, the position of each locus on a chromosome in the genome of that species is estimated in kb, just as in an actual sequence assembly. this map-integration strategy has been shown to be very powerful and accurate, and has been applied to livestock species not then sequenced  <cit> .

for the tammar wallaby, there are cytogenetic and linkage-mapping resources that can be integrated to provide a framework for the genome assembly. a linkage map has been under construction for many years: the first-generation map was published in  <dig>  incorporating  <dig> loci on all autosomes and the x chromosome  <cit> . since then, many loci have been added, creating a second-generation linkage map comprising  <dig> loci, with a total size of  <dig>  cm, and an average inter-locus distance of  <dig>  cm . the chromosomes of the tammar wallaby have been thoroughly characterized  <cit> , and have been mapped by fish using bacs containing functional loci with human orthologues. the strategy of screening for tammar orthologues of genes that flank regions with a conserved gene content in both humans and opossum   <cit>  has delivered the locations of  <dig> genes in the tammar wallaby, including nearly all the new loci in the second-generation linkage map  <cit>  . the initial focus in the present paper is therefore to integrate all available tammar wallaby mapping information to provide the "backbone" for a tammar map that is based only on tammar wallaby information.

the integration of these hard-won tammar wallaby resources produces a map that is valuable, but not sufficiently complete or high-resolution to be adequate for genome assembly, e.g. some of the fish locations on small chromosome arms cannot be specified to a greater precision than a whole arm. comparative mapping information can be utilised to refine the relatively crude fish locations of some tammar wallaby genes. thus, without compromising the "backbone" of the integrated map that is based on tammar wallaby linkage and cytogenetic maps, comparative information from the most closely related sequenced genome is used to fine-tune the location of genes in the integrated map for which only crude tammar locations are available. finally, a tammar wallaby virtual genome map is created by assuming conservation of synteny in the intervals between genes in the integrated map, again using primarily information from the tammar wallaby's nearest sequenced evolutionary neighbour, opossum, and  from human. although this latter step provides only a null hypothesis of the actual order and relative location of genes not yet mapped in the tammar wallaby, in the absence of any more direct information, this strategy has produced a virtual map that can be used as the framework for the initial assembly of the tammar wallaby genome sequence.

the aims of this paper, therefore, are  to identify blocks of conserved synteny and hence evolutionary breakpoints in the tammar wallaby genome;  to create a first-generation integrated tammar wallaby map by combining all available tammar mapping information for genes that have been mapped in tammar wallaby, making use of orthologous marker locations in opossum and human to fine tune loci fish-mapped in tammar wallaby with low resolution; and  to create a first-generation tammar wallaby virtual genome map by utilising comparative opossum and human mapping information, for genes that have not been mapped in tammar wallaby.

RESULTS
the integrated and virtual maps of the tammar wallaby genome were created from the second-generation linkage map, comprising  <dig> loci  <cit> , together with fish-mapping data for  <dig> loci , using the strategy described by liao et al  <cit> . firstly, we estimated the physical size and linkage size of each tammar wallaby chromosome, and the total genome size. we then identified blocks of conserved synteny between tammar wallaby and opossum , and identified breakpoints between them. next we estimated the size of each chromosome arm, and estimated band locations in kb by linear interpolation. we then created files of fish locations, linkage-map locations and breakpoints for each chromosome, and also an orthologue-location file for fish-mapped markers, all of which were used to create the integrated map. finally, orthologue-location files were created for all the conserved syntenic blocks, and these were used to create the virtual genome map. chromosome nomenclature follows the usual practice: hsa , meu  and mdo .

step 1: estimation of mb and cm size of each chromosome
the tammar wallaby genome consists of seven pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, x and y. the physical size  of each tammar wallaby chromosome was determined by direct comparison with the well established sizes of human chromosomes. the direct comparison was performed by bivariate flow karyotyping and the results are presented in table  <dig>  tammar wallaby chromosomes 1- <dig> are all larger than human chromosomes. for instance, meu <dig> is about twice the size of hsa <dig>  notable is the size of meux of  <dig> mb, which is a value between hsa <dig> and hsax. despite meux having a much smaller gene content than hsax and being regarded as the ancestral therian x  <cit> , its dna content is comparable with hsax, due to the addition of repetitive sequences of this nor-bearing chromosome. the estimated total linkage length for each chromosome, also shown in table  <dig>  was estimated as its cm length in the second-generation linkage map, divided by the estimated proportion of chromosome covered by that linkage map .

a  <dig>  cm is the estimated cm length of xq only because there is a large nor in xp which precludes a reasonable estimate of the total cm length of the x chromosome.

step 2: estimation of genome size
the tammar wallaby genome size is estimated to be  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  cm determined by adding up the chromosome sizes given in table  <dig>  this physical size is smaller than the human genome size of  <dig>  gb  <cit> .

step 3: identification of blocks of conserved synteny and evolutionary breakpoints between tammar wallaby, opossum and human
for every gene fish-mapped in the tammar wallaby, the location of its orthologue in the opossum and human genomes was determined. blocks with conserved gene content were identified, as were genes that marked the end of each block and hence evolutionary breakpoints. estimates were obtained of the size  of each block of conserved synteny, and sizes of the blocks were summed over chromosomes and scaled to the estimated total size of the relevant tammar wallaby chromosome, creating a location  in tammar wallaby for each breakpoint. these blocks were defined to reflect the fish-mapping results for all markers. orientation of each block on the tammar wallaby chromosome was deduced from their fish-mapping data wherever possible. amongst the total of  <dig> conserved syntenic blocks, there were  <dig> with only one orthologous gene,  <dig> of which are on meu <dig>  when fish data did not suggest a clear orientation of the block and for the one-probe blocks, the gene orders were retained the same as in the reference genome . with the one-probe blocks comprising only  <dig> mb, compared with  <dig> mb coverage of multi-gene blocks, this assumption concerning gene order was not critically important. a summary of the estimated breakpoints for all autosomes is presented in table  <dig>  the x chromosome was excluded from this table because, even though all the loci fish-mapped to meux are located on mdox, there were no obvious regions of conserved synteny, so it was not possible to estimate the breakpoints. figure  <dig> illustrates the blocks of conserved synteny, and the breakpoints, for a typical tammar wallaby chromosome, meu <dig>  similar illustrations for each of the other tammar wallaby chromosomes are presented in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  and additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> 

as an example of the approach, meu <dig> comprises nine blocks of conserved synteny, indicated as blocks a-i in figure  <dig>  with their boundaries defined by eight breakpoints. loci on the right-hand side of meu <dig> are end markers for each conserved syntenic block, which were fish-mapped in tammar wallaby. the last three blocks  have no clear opossum counterparts, but show marked conserved synteny with regions of hsa  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, their fish-mapping locations in tammar wallaby are too close to resolve, so we could not determine the orientation of these blocks in tammar wallaby. different tammar wallaby chromosomes showed different degrees of evolutionary rearrangement, the number of blocks of conserved synteny ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> 

the only difficulty encountered in identifying blocks of conserved synteny in autosomes concerned the p arm of meu <dig> , for which only approximately  <dig> mb  could be identified as being orthologous to human or opossum chromosomal segments . therefore, breakpoint analyses were not carried out on meu2p.

step 4: estimation of centromere position and arm lengths
in all tammar wallaby chromosomes except meu <dig>  the fish-mapping data from tammar wallaby indicated that the centromere was located between two blocks of conserved synteny. thus it was placed at the breakpoint between those two blocks. for meu <dig>  the fish-mapping data suggested the centromere is located within a conserved block, between markers egfl <dig> and ctps <dig>  the location of this centromere was first estimated as the mid-point  between these two markers. the distances between each of these markers and the two breakpoints defining this conserved block in opossum were then rescaled onto the tammar wallaby version of this conserved block, to provide an estimate of the location of this centromere in the tammar wallaby.

the size of each arm of each autosome was then estimated in mb from the chromosome sizes from step  <dig> and the relative conserved syntenic block sizes on each side of a centromere. the arm sizes in cm were firstly calculated using the same p and q arm ratio as in mb. where necessary, they were then minimally adjusted to ensure that the centromere was located between two flanking markers, one of which had been fish-mapped to the p arm and the other to the q arm. table  <dig> shows the estimated size of each autosome arm. no orthologous regions were identified in the short arm of meu <dig>  so arm sizes in mb and cm for meu <dig> p and q were estimated from the arm ratio of 12: <dig> in the published tammar wallaby karyotype  <cit> . an arm file with the p and q arm mb and cm lengths was then created for each chromosome.

step 5: estimation of the kb location of the beginning and end of each band in the idiogram
the proportional location of each border of each band was estimated from the standard idiogram  <cit>  and translated into kb locations by linear interpolation within the total kb size of the relevant chromosome arm, as determined in step  <dig>  a band file was created for each chromosome and, after an iterative curation process as described in the methods section, the final band definitions was determined, as presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

step 6: creation of an input file from each source of mapping data
linkage map and fish-map input files were created for each chromosome, as described in the methods section. a fish-orthologue file was created for each block of conserved synteny with either opossum  or human, to enable the fine-tuning of the location of fish-mapped markers that would otherwise be located via the ldb process in the centre of their band. a breakpoints file was also created for each chromosome.

step 7: creation of an integrated map
for each chromosome, the integration process was run using the ldb software  <cit> , with the integration order being fish-map file, linkage-map file, breakpoints file and fish-orthologue file, followed by manual curation of the band definitions by checking the discrepancies between the ldb predicted and the fish-mapped band locations, as described in the methods section, and running the integration process again until no further discrepancies existed. this produced an integrated map for each chromosome, combining all available fish-mapping and linkage-mapping data. for markers whose only tammar wallaby data comprised fish locations, their predicted locations in the integrated map were fine-tuned by the comparative information contained in the fish-orthologue files.

as an example, portions of the integrated map of meu <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  the map extends from the 5p telomere  at  <dig> kb to the 5q telomere  at  <dig> kb. the 5qtr location corresponds to the size of chromosome  <dig> . similarly, the predicted locations in the linkage map of meu <dig> range from  <dig> cm to  <dig>  cm, the latter location corresponding to the estimated cm length of meu <dig> . included in table  <dig> are each of the eight breakpoints in this chromosome, together with loci flanking these breakpoints and the loci adjacent to the telomeres. complete integrated maps for all meu autosomes are presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  and are also available through the comparative location database  <cit> . in total, there are  <dig> markers in the first-generation integrated map across all autosomes.

markers in bold are also shown in the virtual genome map 

* "..." rows indicate where there are markers not listed in the table.

step 8: creation of a virtual genome map
opossum and human orthologue files, containing opossum  or human orthologous locations for all mapped and unmapped genes in each conserved syntenic block, were constructed for each block of conserved synteny, as described in the methods section. a virtual genome map for each chromosome was then constructed by incorporating the relevant orthologue files into the integrated map for that chromosome, using the same ldb software.

the virtual genome map for a tammar wallaby chromosome therefore comprises all genes whose location on that chromosome is supported by available tammar wallaby and orthologous information, including the many genes that have not yet been mapped in this species. in this virtual genome map, three confidence levels are defined. the highest  is assigned to loci that have been mapped  in the tammar wallaby. the middle level  is applied to those loci not mapped in the tammar wallaby but which occur in a block of conserved synteny whose orientation in tammar wallaby can be deduced from fish-mapping data. the lowest level  is given to those loci, which are neither mapped in tammar wallaby, nor have any evidence from tammar wallaby supporting their order within their conserved syntenic blocks.

to illustrate this outcome, portions of the virtual genome map for meu <dig> are presented in table  <dig>  the total length of the chromosome is the same as in the integrated map, namely  <dig> kb and  <dig>  cm. it can be seen in table  <dig> that two opossum markers  have been interpolated between cxadr and samsn <dig>  similarly,  <dig> opossum markers have been interpolated between the centromere and ctps <dig>  these two sets of interpolated opossum markers have a confidence level of  <dig>  indicating that although they have not been mapped in tammar wallaby, in each case their orientation could be deduced from the known orientation of the two flanking markers that are also in that group in the opossum assembly . next, seventeen human markers  have been interpolated between breakpoint  <dig> and, dffb and four human markers between leng <dig> and qtr. these two sets of markers have a confidence level of  <dig>  indicating that although they are predicted  to be located between the relevant markers shown in bold, their orientation and order are not known with any certainty.

across all autosomes, the virtual genome map comprises  <dig> loci and has a size of  <dig> mb. because of its size, the entire tammar wallaby virtual genome map could not be included in the additional files. it is available through the comparative location database  <cit> .

discussion
given the large quantity of data incorporated, the first-generation integrated and virtual genome maps reported here will enhance significantly genome research in the tammar wallaby , and facilitate the assembly of the genome sequence of this species.

whenever comparative data were required, we have been conservative in using wherever possible the genome of the most closely related sequenced marsupial. the tammar wallaby and the opossum diverged around  <dig> mya  <cit> , comparable with the divergence within eutheria, amongst which much use has been made of comparative information, e.g. dog and human  <cit> ; sheep and human  <cit> . the next-best choices are eutherians, which are more than twice as distant   <cit> . these realities provide a strong justification for the present strategy of drawing comparative information from opossum in preference to eutherians.

in addition, the remarkable conservation of chromosome arrangement in marsupials makes this approach particularly appropriate for the tammar wallaby. whereas the eutherian genome has been grossly rearranged in many lineages, there is very strong conservation of synteny between tammar wallaby and opossum  <cit> , even to the extent of whole chromosome arms being conserved  <cit> . when the integrated map was used to create the virtual genome map, the preferred strategy was, once again, to rely as much as possible on the tammar wallaby's nearest sequenced evolutionary neighbour, and then to turn to one of the most mature genome assemblies, namely human, only in the minority of cases where the opossum information was not sufficient.

of course there will be errors in the order and relative location of loci, especially in the virtual genome map: the integration of data from conserved blocks of synteny means that the location of most tammar wallaby genes in the virtual genome map is predicted on the basis of their order in other species. however, as argued above, in using whenever possible comparative mapping data from opossum, we are, in effect, relying on better comparative information then has been the basis of the utilisation of comparative mapping information within eutherians.

estimation of conserved-synteny blocks is not a simple process, and errors are certain to have been made, given the relative paucity of information available in the tammar wallaby. for the markers with the lowest confidence level, it is important to note that close-range locus order presented is just one of several equally likely possibilities.

as more sequence-level comparative data become available, these blocks will be better defined.

in principle, the overall aim of creating an integrated map is to combine together in a rational manner all available mapping information in the species of interest, without recourse to any information from other species. in the creation of the integrated map of sheep, for example  <cit> , comparative data were used only in the local repositioning of loci that had all been fish-mapped to the same chromosomal band. as discussed by liao et al.  <cit> , this did not compromise the essential integrity of the integrated map in reflecting all available sheep data: it simply provided a first estimate of the order of a set of loci that are known to be located within a particular band. in the case of the tammar wallaby, there was a lack of orthologues mapped with sufficient resolution in this species, which precluded the local ordering of loci that had been fish-mapped to a particular band. the best solution, given the lack of resources to create a denser physical map, was to estimate evolutionary breakpoints in the tammar wallaby with respect to the opossum  and human assemblies. whilst this provides an additional compromise to the integrity of the integrated map, this does not alter any mapping data gleaned from the wallaby alone. therefore, in practice, it does not provide any additional compromise to the integrity of the wallaby-mapping data.

how does this first-generation virtual genome map compare with the resources used in genome assemblies in other species? the bovine genome sequence  <cit>  was assembled onto a single rh map  <cit> . the opossum genome assembly  <cit>  was assigned to chromosomes based primarily on fish-mapping of bacs from scaffolds  <cit> , with support from the second of two linkage maps whose terminal markers had also been fish-mapped  <cit> . our tammar wallaby first-generation virtual genome map is more comprehensive than either of these strategies, since it is based on all available mapping information from the species itself, combined in a rational manner, supplemented by comparative mapping data. this integrated map is better and more useful than either of its components considered alone. obviously it would be desirable to obtain more mapping information  for the tammar wallaby. as such data become available in the future, they will be used in the construction of second-generation integrated and virtual genome maps. in the meantime, the maps described in this paper are the best available at this time; they utilize all available information to create the most complete maps of the tammar wallaby chromosomes that can be produced at this time.

as pointed out by lewin et al.  <cit> , "every genome sequence needs a good map". genome sequence itself is not sufficient to enable a chromosome assembly or construction of good comparative maps to reveal hidden evolutionary stories. good genome maps  are a necessary complement to genome sequence. however, they are of limited use in isolation. what is needed is a means of integrating all available mapping data for a species into a single map. the first-generation integrated map reported in this paper achieves this aim for the tammar wallaby, and has enabled the creation of a first-generation virtual genome map for this species, combining the integrated map with comparative mapping data from species with more mature chromosome assemblies.

by combining the first-generation virtual genome map presented in this paper with the ensembl annotation  <cit>  of the initial  tammar wallaby assembly, it is now possible to construct the first draft chromosome assembly for the tammar wallaby. in their annotation process, ensembl were able to create  <dig> "gene-scaffolds" comprising two or more meug_ <dig>  scaffolds. of these,  <dig> have one gene in common with the virtual genome map, and an additional  <dig> have more than one gene in common with the virtual map, giving a total of  <dig> gene-scaffolds that can be incorporated into a chromosome assembly, based on the virtual genome map. thus 78% of the ensembl gene-scaffolds can be incorporated into a tammar wallaby chromosome assembly, and 9% of the gene-scaffolds can be orientated in this chromosome assembly.

in addition to the ensembl gene-scaffolds, there are another  <dig> meug_ <dig>  scaffolds that have at least one gene in common with the virtual genome map, and  <dig> meug_ <dig>  scaffolds that have multiple genes in common with the virtual genome map. the total size of gene-scaffolds and scaffolds that can be incorporated into a chromosome assembly is  <dig> , <dig> bp, which is 22% of the estimated tammar wallaby genome size . this chromosome assembly includes  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes identified in the ensembl annotation. in other words, the virtual genome map enables the creation of a chromosome-based tammar wallaby genome assembly that includes a high proportion  of protein-coding genes identified in the sequence data. this compares with the few gene-scaffolds whose location can be determined solely from the integrated map built almost exclusively from tammar wallaby mapping information: only  <dig> gene-scaffolds have one gene in common with the integrated map and three gene-scaffolds have more than one gene in common with the integrated map. also the virtual genome map has been tested in the recent tammar wallaby genome sequence assembly attempt and has significantly enhanced the n <dig> of the assembly  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
construction of a tammar wallaby first-generation integrated map has allowed prediction of the genomic content and organization of the wallaby genome via a first-generation virtual genome map, which will be useful as a resource for assembly of the wallaby genome sequence. since marsupial chromosomes are highly conserved  <cit> , the results from this study, when combined with the opossum assembly, will inform studies on the genome of other marsupial species. in particular, the detailed breakpoints between opossum/human and tammar wallaby revealed in this study will be useful for studies of genome evolution in marsupials, construction of an ancestral marsupial karyotype, and comparisons with the genomes of eutherians, and with non-mammal vertebrates.
