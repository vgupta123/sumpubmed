BACKGROUND
gene duplication is an important factor in evolution. these duplications can arise during the expansion of low copy repeats , or segmental duplications, which make up a significant proportion of the human genome sequence  <cit> . the high sequence identity  shared between these dna segments indicates that they have arisen over the past  <dig> million years  of primate evolution and in some instances are human specific. detailed analyses of lcrs in humans have shown that these repeats are often interspersed, rather than tandemly duplicated  <cit> . lcrs are observed both interchromosomally, with enrichment in pericentromeric and subtelomeric chromosomal regions  <cit> , and intrachromosomally, with enrichment in euchromatic sequences.

lcrs have important consequences in vertebrate gene evolution. traditionally, the major force in genome evolution was thought to be nucleotide substitutions. however, gene duplications have been shown to significantly contribute to evolution by acting as molecular substrates for divergence  <cit> . in fact, the estimated rate of duplicate gene fixation   <cit>  is similar to or greater than the estimated nucleotide substitution rate at silent sites   <cit> . duplicate genes arise by several different mechanisms: unequal crossing over and retroposition, which give rise to small duplications, and chromosomal duplication and whole genome polyploidization, which involve much larger amounts of dna  <cit> . considering that the last whole genome polyploidization event in the land vertebrate lineage is estimated to have occurred more than  <dig> my ago  <cit> , duplications of this nature are not expected to play a role in primate speciation. instead, smaller duplications, such as those creating lcrs, which maintain gene structure and organization, are predicted to have significantly affected recent primate evolution. this theory is supported by the finding that segmental duplications make up a significant proportion of primate genomes, with estimates of around 5% in the human genome  <cit> . although the lcr composition of mammalian genomes has been recently examined, an in-depth investigation of the gene content in lcrs and their role in gene evolution has not been undertaken.

studies have shown an unexpectedly large complement of functional gene duplicates in most genomes  <cit> , which can be accounted for by two of the fates for duplicated genes. one of these fates, subfunctionalization, occurs when both copies of a gene degenerate in a complementary fashion, such that both copies are required to perform the ancestral functions  <cit> . the other fate is neofunctionalization, in which positive selection for beneficial mutations occurs, allowing one of the gene copies to diverge rapidly and adopt a new function  <cit> . subfunctionalization is predicted to develop more frequently than neofunctionalization because it exploits common degenerative mutations rather than relying on rare beneficial mutations.

the third and most common fate for copies of a gene following duplication and fixation is for one of the copies to become nonfunctional through the accumulation of deleterious mutations. these mutations are tolerated when duplicate genes are functionally redundant, relaxing the selection on at least one of the two copies. in humans, it is estimated that duplicate genes have an average half life of  <dig>  my  <cit> . after a copy is silenced, a nonfunctional remnant will exist until it is deleted or mutated beyond recognition. these remnants are known as pseudogenes. pseudogenes can also be created by partial duplications that exclude key sequences or regulatory regions of genes. several recent studies have evaluated the pseudogene content in the human genome  <cit>  and have found that their number may equal or even surpass the number of functional genes.

although pseudogenization restores the proteome to its pre-duplication state, it may passively affect adaptive evolution. since selection is often relaxed on both copies of the gene after duplication, either the ancestral or the progeny copy can be inactivated. pseudogenization of the ancestral copy constitutes gene relocation. much like larger rearrangements, relocation of unique genes to different chromosomes can contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation  <cit> .

here we describe the relocation of the gene dpy19l <dig> within a set of lcrs . although this type of genome modification has been hypothesized  <cit> , very few examples of this type of relocation have been documented  <cit> . we demonstrate the relocation of a functional gene through its duplication and subsequent pseudogenization within a lcr. additionally, we characterize another functional gene, dpy19l <dig>  and six pseudogenes within these lcrs. both of these functional genes belong to a novel transmembrane gene family, dpy19l, containing four human genes, which has undergone both ancient and recent duplications. this paper investigates the evolution of these novel transcripts and describes the lcrs that are associated with the recent gene duplications and relocation.

RESULTS
physical organization of the low copy repeats
a large duplication of sequence between 7p <dig>  and 7p <dig>  was identified during the annotation of human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . blastn  <cit>  searches against the nr database using these two regions as query sequences identified six additional loci containing large stretches of duplicated dna. in total, eight regions were identified with >90% identity over > <dig> kb and were designated lcr7a through lcr7h based on their sizes. seven of these regions are located on chromosome  <dig>  five on the p arm and two on the q arm, while one region is located on the q arm of chromosome  <dig> .

to define the duplication boundaries and determine their structures, two programs, blast  <dig> sequences  <cit>  and mvista  <cit>  were utilized. for these analyses, the sequences of the lcrs on chromosome  <dig> were obtained from the chromosome  <dig> annotation project sequence  while the sequence on chromosome  <dig> was acquired from ncbi's public build  <dig> . using the two programs we were able to determine the size and sequence content of the lcrs . we were also able to resolve the complex modular structure of the duplications, tracing much of the duplicated dna back to lcr7a by a best match analysis . overall, the eight lcrs comprise more than  <dig> mb of duplicated dna with sequence identities ranging from 94â€“98% .

identification of transcripts in low copy repeats
we inspected the eight regions for known transcripts that had been duplicated during the expansion of the lcrs. we initially examined lcr7a, since it was the largest of the examined lcrs, and found two known transcripts . we confirmed their transcription and identified upstream exons by rt-pcr and 5' race on human testis rna. all transcripts identified below were analyzed in a similar manner.

the first transcript from lcr7a  has  <dig> exons and a complete open reading frame  coding for  <dig> amino acids. we defined an orf as complete when it codes for > <dig> amino acids and is uninterrupted between a start codon in the first exon and an inframe stop codon in the last exon. this is a conservative definition of a complete orf and may exclude transcripts with functions that do not require the complete cds, such as those undergoing neo- or subfunctionalization. transcripts with complete orfs were classified as genes. although the function of ab <dig> is unknown, in silico analysis indicated that it encodes a protein with homology to the c. elegans protein dpy- <dig> . therefore, we called this gene dpy19l <dig> . ten exons from this gene  appear to be duplicated in a known transcript within lcr7b . along with these ten exons, ak <dig> has an additional two upstream and five downstream exons that fall outside the duplicated sequence, giving it a total of  <dig> exons. however, unlike dpy19l <dig>  this transcript does not appear to encode a complete orf because it has stop codons in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  this transcript, which we named dpy19l1p <dig> , was classified as a pseudogene. we defined a pseudogene as a duplicated transcript that has lost its original function due to incomplete duplication or at least one interruption of the orf.

the second transcript from lcr7a  also has  <dig> exons. this transcript does not have a complete orf because it has stop codons in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  duplications of all  <dig> exons of this transcript were seen in two other regions: lcr7c and lcr7d. the transcript in lcr7c  is a gene because it has a complete orf coding for  <dig> amino acids. in silico analysis of this orf again showed homology to the c. elegans gene dpy- <dig>  although with a lower percent identity  . therefore, we named this gene dpy19l <dig> . like the second transcript on lcr7a, the transcript on lcr7d  has inframe stop codons, caused by insertions of ltr repeats in exon  <dig>  these inactivated transcripts on lcr7a and lcr7d are classified as pseudogenes, and we named them dpy19l2p <dig> and dpy19l2p <dig> respectively .

the two genes and three pseudogenes make up a set of duplicated known transcripts within the eight lcrs. to identify novel transcripts that belong within this set, we used the two coding genes as queries for ucsc blat searches  <cit>  against the human genome build  <dig> sequence. using sequence identity to uncharacterized mrna and est transcripts, we were able to identify three additional pseudogenes that arose from partial duplications. one transcript in lcr7b, dpy19l1p <dig>  shows high identity with dpy19l <dig>  while two other transcripts, dpy19l2p <dig> in lcr7e and dpy19l2p <dig> in lcr7f, share high identity with dpy19l <dig> . the relationships between these transcripts are illustrated by an analysis of their phylogeny .

genomic relocation of dpy19l2
although both dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig> share homology to the c. elegans gene dpy- <dig> and are within a set of related lcrs, these two genes are not recent duplicates of each other. we reached this conclusion because the region of lcr7a that contains dpy19l <dig> does not show high sequence identity with the region of lcr7c that contains dpy19l <dig> . instead, we attribute their similarity to an ancient duplication that occurred prior to mammalian divergence. this is supported by two observations: the percent nucleotide identity between the two transcripts is ~76%  and both genes are also present in mouse. the two mouse genes, dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig>  share ~72% nucleotide sequence identity with each other and are ~ <dig>  kb apart on mouse chromosome  <dig> in a region syntenic to lcr7a on human chromosome 7p <dig>  . importantly, blastn analysis indicates that these two genes, and their genomic regions, are unique in the mouse genome and do not appear to have been recently duplicated within lcrs. notably, the functional dpy19l <dig> is syntenic to the human pseudogene dpy19l2p <dig>  not to the functional dpy19l <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  this indicates that the ancestral copy of dpy19l <dig> was present on chromosome  <dig> . this is confirmed by our analysis of the genes in dog and rat. segmental duplication of this region onto chromosome 12q <dig>  established two copies of the functional gene. initial functional redundancy relaxed the selection on one or both of the copies of this gene, allowing the fixation of an inactivating pseudogenization event. in this case, the ancestral copy on 7p <dig>  was pseudogenized while the copy on 12q <dig>  remained functional. thus, dpy19l <dig> has undergone gene relocation within a recent lcr .

neutral evolution of recently duplicated transcripts
we analyzed the three known pseudogenes within the lcrs, each of which contains a substantial duplication of the original orf. we hypothesized that if these transcripts are no longer functional, their sequences would not be under selectional constraint. hence, they would be evolving neutrally. we looked for evidence of selection by two methods, codon position bias of nucleotide changes and ka/ks; each assumes nucleotide changes accumulate evenly in the three codon positions during neutral evolution. as it is possible that truncation following duplication can result in a new gene, with purifying selection 5' and neutral evolution 3' of the new stop codon, we selected the largest orf in each of the pseudogenes for this analysis. in each case, the largest orf observed corresponded to a truncation of the original orf, rather than a frameshift.

our first analysis looks at the distributions of nucleotide changes between the functional genes and the inactive transcripts and then compares them to the distributions of changes between the functional genes in human and mouse. in this analysis, the nucleotide changes in the largest orf of the inactive transcripts are more equally distributed than the changes between the human and mouse functional genes . as expected, the changes between the two functional genes are in a 3rd>1st>2nd codon position distribution, which is indicative of purifying selection.

distributions of nucleotide changes affect the synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates. in purifying selection, we expect the synonymous rate to be much higher than the non-synonymous rates , whereas in neutral selection the rates are expected to be very similar. much like the first analysis, we see that the substitution rate between the functional human and mouse genes suggests purifying selection, while the ka/ks values within the inactive genes' orfs are much higher . most likely, this increase in ka/ks indicates relaxed or neutral selection of the pseudogenes.

dpy19-like gene family
along with dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig>  homology searches identified two other human genes that have amino acid identity to the c. elegans gene dpy- <dig> . these two genes, dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig>  are located on chromosomes 19q <dig>  and 8q <dig> , respectively, and do not reside in any segmental duplications. both of these transcripts are known genes spanning  <dig> exons and are covered by full-length mrna transcripts . similar to dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig>  the functions of these genes are uncharacterized.

rt-pcr analysis of these homologous genes shows similar ubiquitous expression in all tissues examined . however, although the pattern of expression is highly similar between dpy19l <dig>  dpy19l <dig>  and dpy19l <dig>  there appears to be some slight variations in the expression of dpy19l <dig>  the majority of these differences can be attributed to the concomitant amplification of two pseudogenes, dpy19l2p <dig> and dpy19l2p <dig>  these two pseudogenes share such high identity with the functional gene that we were unable to specifically amplify dpy19l <dig>  by sequencing the bands from the rt-pcr experiment, we were able to determine the expression of dpy19l <dig> and the two pseudogenes by analyzing transcript specific paralogous sequence variants. dpy19l <dig> appears to be expressed to some degree in all tissues, while dpy19l2p <dig> is expressed in the brain, heart, placenta and testis and dpy19l2p <dig> is expressed in the fibroblast, lung, lymphoblast, spleen and testis. superfluous pseudogene amplification can account for the increase in expression seen in certain tissues. however, other tissues, such as liver, skeletal muscle, spleen and small intestine, are shown to have significantly lower expression in dpy19l <dig> . this might indicate some differences in dpy19l <dig> gene regulation.

we used ncbi's blast  <cit>  and ucsc's blat  <cit>  tools to identify proteins homologous to dpy- <dig> in other animals . these protein sequences were then aligned using clustalw  <cit> . with the multiple alignment file, a neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega <dig>  <cit>  . as a test of inferred phylogeny, bootstrap values were calculated using  <dig> replications. from this analysis we can see that invertebrate animals such as nematodes  and deuterostomes  have a single dpy- <dig> gene, while all vertebrates examined have at least three homologous copies. this suggests that multiple duplications have occurred during vertebrate evolution. the first duplications appear to have occurred prior to the divergence of the fish lineage, giving rise to two additional copies, dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig>  which are present in all vertebrates. an additional duplication, generating dpy19l <dig>  appears to have arisen prior to mammalian divergence. this gene appears in all mammals examined, including the metatherian opossum . however, it is unclear whether this duplication occurred before or after the divergence of chicken. although chicken is lacking dpy19l <dig>  one of its proteins is placed in the dpy19l <dig> clade  rather than grouping with the dpy- <dig> proteins. this could indicate that the duplication leading to dpy19l <dig> has occurred before chicken divergence with subsequent gene loss in chicken . alternatively, the duplication could have occurred after chicken divergence, with the chicken protein maintaining more similarity to dpy19l <dig> due to an accelerated evolution of dpy19l <dig> relative to dpy19l <dig> . through these observations, we estimate that the duplication that generated dpy19l <dig> arose between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya . additional trees were built using different phylogenetic methods  to confirm the observed phylogeny. overall, these trees had a highly similar topology to the tree presented in fig. 4b .

structure and conservation of dpy- <dig> homologs
dpy- <dig> is a novel transmembrane protein that is required for the proper polarization and migration of neuroblasts in c. elegans. it has been shown to express weakly in the ql and qr neuroblasts, their neighbouring epidermal cells, and in dorsal and ventral body muscle cells  <cit> . to ensure that the four human homologues have similar structures to this gene, we compared their domain architectures using smart  <cit>  and pfam  <cit> . dpy- <dig> does not have any predicted smart or pfam domains, but does have  <dig> predicted transmembrane domains, consistent with its characterization as a transmembrane protein. similarly, the four human homologues have  <dig> to  <dig> predicted transmembrane domains, which suggest that they share a similar protein structure with dpy- <dig> 

using the multiple species amino acid alignment, we were able to identify putative motifs with high conservation using the program meme  <cit> . three putative motifs, each at least  <dig> amino acids in width and present in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins, were identified by this program. all three putative domains are significantly more conserved at the amino acid level than the rest of the proteins . however, two of these motifs contained one or more transmembrane domains in a subset of the proteins. therefore, the conservation in these two regions is most likely due to the presence of a transmembrane domain. the third motif, which was the largest and most significant motif identified by meme, does not match any known domains. this motif is present near the c-termini of the proteins and may represent a novel functionally relevant sequence .

discussion
low copy repeats in extant genomes represent the most recent duplications of large stretches of dna. in humans, sequence and cytogenetic data indicate that the commonly used thresholds are detecting lcrs that have arisen within the past  <dig> my of primate evolution  <cit> . these active, and not uncommon, restructurings within genomes have important implications in molecular evolution. genes duplicated within lcrs can diverge through substitutions or exon shuffling  <cit> , allowing, in rare circumstances, novel functions to develop. also, because of their high nucleotide sequence identity, copies of lcrs can act as substrates for large rearrangements, such as deletions, inversions and duplications . such large rearrangements are often found to cause genomic disorders, while less severe changes are theorized to be significant factors in genome evolution and speciation.

in this paper, we demonstrate that lcrs can also have a more subtle effect on genome evolution. we first characterize a set of lcrs on human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these lcrs have a complex modular structure with sequence identities ranging from 94â€“98% . the exact order of the lcr expansion is difficult to ascertain due to this complexity, as well as the similarity in sequence identity between the regions. even the branching order of the transcripts contained within the lcrs is not easily resolved due to their high sequence similarity . after the characterization of these regions and their transcripts, we then describe a novel example of functional gene relocation through duplication and subsequent pseudogenization within a lcr . this is a type of small chromosomal rearrangement that has been implicated in evolution, and has been suggested to be involved in speciation events through population isolation followed by divergent resolution of duplicate genes  <cit> . gene silencing has also been shown to relocate functional genes following whole genome duplication  <cit>  or subtelomeric duplication  <cit>  events. the example we report is the first characterization of functional gene relocation within a euchromatic lcr. we propose that, like rearrangements of dna segments and gene structures, rearrangements in gene order during lcr creation and expansion are a noteworthy mechanism for genome evolution and divergence.

unlike whole genome duplication, gene relocation following duplication within a lcr can modify a gene's genomic context. specifically, cis-acting elements neighbouring the ancestral locus may be different from the cis-acting elements neighbouring the descendent locus, causing the positional effects on the gene to be altered. thus, changes in expression and function are considered to be another consequence of gene relocation. interestingly, the slight variation in dpy19l <dig> expression  could indicate a change in regulation. one interpretation of this finding is that the change in expression is caused by a difference in cis-acting elements between the functional gene's ancestral and descendant locations.

our data is consistent with the concept that there are two major fates of gene duplication: retention of both copies or pseudogenization of one of the transcripts. within the set of lcrs, we were able to identify two homologous functional genes, apparently created by a duplication event of a common ancestor homologous to the c. elegans dpy- <dig> gene. these genes illustrate how both copies of a gene duplicate can be retained. preservation of both copies may be due to some selective advantage, either through increased dosage, neofunctionalization, or complementary degeneration leading to subfunctionalization.

these functional genes have been duplicated within lcrs, creating new transcripts. however, for both genes only a single transcript has remained active. the others, although transcribed, are all pseudogenes due to loss of coding potential through partial duplication or accumulation of deleterious mutations . this supports the notion that pseudogenization is the most common fate of gene duplication  <cit> . in addition, we tested for selection acting on the three duplicated pseudogenes containing a substantial orf. in two of the three transcripts, selection was relaxed such that they appeared to be undergoing neutral selection. in the third transcript, the selection was relaxed relative to the functional gene, but some purifying selection, indicated by ka/ks < <dig>  was still apparent . it is important to note that an increased ratio may also represent a mixture of positive and negative selection. however, in combination these analyses show that the inactive transcripts appear to be undergoing neutral evolution, indicating that they have indeed lost their coding potential and are not being selectively maintained. this fits with the perception that most pseudogenes, like non-coding regions, are free of selection  <cit> . evidence of selection in one transcript could indicate that it has some actively maintained function. however, the significantly relaxed selection in this case may suggest a recent inactivation that has yet to accumulate enough mutations for neutral selection to be distinguished. in any case, we expect the non-functional remnants of gene duplication to continue to diverge from the original copy, along with the other non-coding regions of the lcr, until eventually all evidence of duplication is erased.

the two functional genes, along with two additional homologues outside of the lcrs, constitute a novel gene family that we designate as the dpy19l family. although the function of this family is unknown, each member has a large complement of predicted transmembrane domains, indicating that they are functional within one of the cellular membranes. along with these domains, this family contains a novel putative motif of high conservation . the high sequence conservation in this putative motif suggests that its sequence may represent a novel functionally important domain that has been maintained throughout the evolution of this gene family. interestingly, dpy19l family members have undergone multiple duplications throughout their evolution. ancient duplications before the divergence of fish led to the creation of two paralogues , while an additional duplication after the divergence of amphibia, yet before the divergence of mammals, created another gene  . analyses of the human genome sequence indicate that the duplication of these genes is an ongoing process. in fact, all four human paralogues show evidence for relatively recent gene duplication. dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig> are both contained in recent low copy repeats, while dpy19l <dig> and dpy19l <dig> appear to have processed pseudogenes with duplications of at least  <dig> exons. duplications of genes are known to play important roles in gene evolution. the recent duplications of all four human genes suggest that the dpy19l gene family is still evolving and may be an important family in the divergence of species.

CONCLUSIONS
the catalogue of lcrs provides an excellent resource for the study of genomic evolution. by characterizing the relationship between sets of lcrs and the genes they contain, we can attempt to understand the mechanisms behind these rearrangements and how they affect evolution. lcrs appear to influence genome composition by affecting genomic sequence structure, gene content and gene order. the last of these influences has not been vigorously investigated. although this is one of the first observations showing a change in gene location with a set of lcrs, we expect that many other examples are present within lcr-rich genomes, and their identification could lead to a better understanding of genome divergence and speciation.
