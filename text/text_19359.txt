BACKGROUND
feeding a high-concentrate diet for a longer period of time can cause subacute ruminal acidosis . it is a digestive disorder with a ph less than  <dig>  lasted for more than 3 h per day  <cit> . general clinical signs of sara comprise of reduced dry matter intake , decreased ruminal ph and diarrhea  <cit> . another crucial outcome of sara is the decline of milk quantity and quality  <cit> , and earlier studies also revealed that sara decreased milk protein yield  <cit> . the persistent consumption of a hc diet by dairy animals enhances the production of organic acids and significantly results in a decline in ph values of the rumen and intestine . this decrease in ph due to excessive high concentrate diet  <cit>  may affect the alterations of the type of fermentation  <cit>  and the structure of the microbes in the rumen  <cit> . moreover, the decline in ph also perturbs the balance of microbial population in the rumen causing substantial release of free endotoxin  from gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . due to possible alterations in permeability and disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier, lps can be translocated into the blood stream  <cit> . there are also other reports revealed that elevated circulating lps cause a systemic inflammatory response  <cit> . possibly, being an element of an immune response to lps, sara has been reported to increase the concentration of acute phase proteins in the peripheral blood, such as serum amyloid a  and haptogloblin   <cit> . the saa has many functions but mainly alters innate immune responses, particularly in the migration of neutrophils and monocytes, while hp has anti-inflammatory effects; lps-binding protein  is activated by microbial infections and facilitates in the neutralization of lps and in the triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α, il- <dig> and il-1β . the innate immune system is the first line of defence against invading pathogens; it involves various types of transmembrane and secreted molecules, recognized as pattern recognition receptors . toll like receptors, such as tlr <dig>  that join the lps-lbp complex, are located on the outer surfaces of a variety of cells and contribute to the sensing of microbial pathogens in the intracellular endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . tlr <dig> recognizes lps with the help of the lbp and cluster of differentiation antigen <dig>   <cit> . lps activates myeloid differentiating factor  <dig>  after joining with tlr <dig> on the host cell surface  <cit> . myd <dig> activates tnf receptor-associated factor  <dig> , which stimulates the iκb kinase  complex, and phosphorylated nf-κb is consequently translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  <cit> . the nf-κb-dependent cascade pathway regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin -1β, tnf-α, il- <dig>  chemokines  and other inflammatory mediators  <cit> . the principal objectives of this study were to evaluate the inflammatory response in cow uterus and to explore the molecular mechanism triggered by high concentrate-induced sara in mid-lactating dairy cows.

methods
animals, diets and experimental design
twelve healthy multiparous holstein cows, which were purchased from the experimental farm of nanjing agricultural university, with an average body weight of 455 kg were selected for the current study. the experimental cows were randomly divided into two groups, each group containing six cows: the high-concentrate  group and the low-concentrate  group. the hc group was provided a high-concentrate diet containing 6: <dig> :  ratio, while lc group was fed low concentrate diet containing 4: <dig>  for the 18-week experimental period. the details of the nutritional ingredients and their compositions are shown in table  <dig>  the cows were surgically fixed with a ruminal fistula two weeks prior to the experiment. the cows were kept in individual tie stalls and feed was offered three times per day at  <dig>   <dig> and 2000 h. dmi was ~ <dig>  kg/d/head, and fresh drinking water was available to them during the entire experimental period. the experiment was started after the animals made a full recovery from the ruminal fistula fixation, and no cows showed any clinical signs of infection during the experiment.table  <dig> ingredient and nutrient composition of diets

collection of samples and analysis
the rumen fluid was collected at one-hour intervals for 12 h daily for  <dig> continuous days during the 18th week. blood samples were collected 4 h after feeding on the sampling days  of the 18th week. 10 ml of rumen fluid was immediately centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 45 min, filtered through a disposable  <dig> -μm filter and stored in pyrogen free glass at −20 °c for lps analysis. the blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into 5-ml vacuum tubes containing sodium heparin as an anticoagulant. the plasma was separated from the blood samples through centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °c for 15 min and stored at −20 °c to determine the concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-1β, il- <dig>  and tnfα in the peripheral blood. at the end of the experiment, the cows were slaughtered after overnight fasting. the slaughtering was performed according to the law of jiangsu provincial people’s government, china and the study was approved by the animal ethics committee  of nanjing agricultural university, china as described in the end of the manuscript. after slaughtering, the uterine tissues were removed from all the cows aseptically, as close to the cervix as possible for the analysis. all collected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °c within 30 min of slaughtering  <cit> .

determination of ruminal ph
rumen fluids were taken through a rumen fistula at one-hour intervals up to 12 h on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the 18th week of the trial. the ph of rumen was measured each hour immediately following the sample collection by ph-meter .

determination of lps
the concentration of lps in the rumen fluid and plasma of the jugular vein was determined by chromogenic endpoint limulus amebocyte lysate assay kits, ce <dig> and ce <dig> . briefly, the pre-treated rumen fluid and plasma samples were diluted until their lps concentrations were in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> endotoxin units /ml relative to the reference endotoxin and assayed as described by gozho et al.  <cit> .

radioimmunoassay
radioimmunoassay was used to calculate the concentrations of il- <dig>  il-1β, and tnf-α in peripheral blood using radioimmunoassay  kits .

rna extraction and real time pcr 
total rna was prepared from 100 mg uterus tissue using trizol  via homogenization on ice as described by the manufacturer’s instructions. the quality of mrna was assessed by both agarose gel  electrophoresis and spectrometry  using the eppendorf bio photometer plus . only samples with a ratio between  <dig>  and  <dig>  were used in subsequent experiments. the first-strand cdna was synthesized using 250 ng/μl of the total rna template using prime script rt master mix perfect real time  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

quantitative real-time pcr  amplification was performed to evaluate the expression of the selected genes. the primers for genes il-1β, tlr <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  <cit> , and lbp  <cit>  were used according to previously published work, while myd <dig>  tnf-α, traf <dig>  and nf-κb were designed using the premier primer  <dig>  software. the primers were assessed for their amplification efficiencies. the reaction conditions included 2 μl of cdna and  <dig>  μm primers in a total volume of 20 μl of super mix. thermal cycling parameters consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °c for 15 s, followed by 40 cycles of annealing at 95 °c for 5 s and primer extension at 60 °c for 31 s. all the reactions were run in triplicate. each cdna sample was amplified using sybr green  in the abi  <dig> fast real-time pcr system .

the data were normalized to the mean of housekeeping gene β-actin to control the unpredictability in expression levels and were analysed using r = 2-ΔΔct method  treatment -  control), as previously depicted  <cit> . the primer sequences used in this study are presented in table  <dig> table  <dig> the list of primer sequences used for amplification of qrt-pcr




western blotting analysis
the protein was extracted from 100 mg uterus tissue with radio immunoprecipitation assay  buffer using a dounce homogenizer . after 30 min of incubation on ice, cell extracts were subjected to centrifugation  at 4 °c for 15 min to obtain cell protein. the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid  protein assay kit  and was adjusted to 4 μg/μl. equal amounts of proteins were isolated using 10% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and shifted to nitrocellulose membrane   at 4 °c. then, 10% non-fat dry milk was used to block the nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was incubated at 4 °c overnight with monoclonal goat antibodies against nf-κb and gapdh , , respectively. after incubation, the membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using an ecl reagent  and subsequently autoradiographed. the results were quantified using bio-rad gel doc 2000™ systems  and analysed with bio-rad tds quantity one software . the relative quantities of proteins were evaluated by a densitometer and expressed as absorbance units .

statistical analyses
the mixed procedure of sas was used to analyze ph with a repeated measures design performed with sas software . the effects of cows were considered random and the effects of diet and time were considered as fixed factors. the time within treatments and cows were considered as repeated measurements and the residuals for each variable were used to assess the normality. the days were averaged within a cow before the analysis for all the data including the ph, radioimmunoassay, ruminal lps, plasma lps and the gene expression data were assessed by independent t-test and expressed as mean ± sem. differences were concluded to be significant at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS

discussion
the present study assessed the uterine inflammation at the molecular level in dairy cows. the inflammatory response in the uterus due to circulating lps derived from rumen triggered the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through tlr <dig> signaling. to evaluate the inflammatory response in cow uterus and to explore the molecular mechanism triggered by high concentrate diet, sara was confirmed by measuring the ph of the rumen. xu et al.  <cit>  also confirmed the presence of sara by measuring the ruminal ph at different time intervals. in our study, the low rumen ph  lasted for 223 min and high concentrations of lps were observed in the rumen fluid and peripheral blood. the recent reports also indicated the successful induction of sara, if theduration of low rumen ph was more than 180 min/day  <cit> . however, there is little literature revealing that sara not only depends on ph, but also on the alteration in the microbial population that develops secondarily to the feed type  <cit> . as a matter of fact, low ruminal ph values led to the lysis of gram-negative bacteria which released lps into the blood circulation  <cit> . consistent with previous studies in dairy cows and feedlot, our results presented higher concentrations of lps in the peripheral plasma  and ruminal fluid  of cows fed a high concentrate die trelative to the peripheral plasma of the lc group  <cit> . moreover, we also found that high concentrate diet feeding increased the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines . similar results have been reported by other researchers  <cit> . the increment in pro-inflammatory cytokines concentration in the plasma may provide confirmation for lps translocation into the blood circulation and eliciting of inflammatory responses. this implies that inflammation in the hc group was due to the high level of lps in the bloodstream, which in turn triggers the pro-inflammatory gene to cope with stress conditions  <cit> .

the rt-qpcr-based findings revealed the presence of inflammation-associated markers in the uterus of sara-induced cows and confirmed that the dairy cows suffered from uterine inflammation at the molecular level. according to our results, the increased expression of tlr <dig> indicated that tlr <dig> recognized the lps and triggered the inflammatory pathway  <cit> . identification of inflammatory-stimuli by the innate immune system is organized by ppr that identify external stimuli for example pathogen associated molecular patterns   <cit> . furthermore, our research demonstrated the increased expression of lbp, myd <dig>  and traf <dig> in the uterus; which provides more clues that the tlr <dig> signaling pathway was stimulated by lps  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that as a main transcription factor, nf-κb may bind to the promoter regions of the many inflammatory genes to regulate their transcription activities  <cit> . similarly, in the current study, nf-κb expression was increased in the hc group, which also confirmed the activation of tlr <dig> signalling pathway. our results of increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and chemokine  in the hc group due to sara-induced lps were consistent with the previous studies .

the western blot results further confirmed that the expression levels of nf-κb  and phosphorylated p <dig> proteins were distinctly increased in the hc group compared to the lc group. taken together, the results suggested that lps triggered the activation of tlr <dig> signalling, which resulted in an inflammatory response in the uterus of cows suffering from sara. conclusively, lps activates tlr4-nf-κb signalling. together with the existing study and the previous reports  <cit> , the protein expressions of nf-κb  and p-p <dig> were magnified in the hc group.

CONCLUSIONS
according to our results, long-term feeding of high concentrate diet causes uterine inflammation in mid-lactating dairy cows. the inflammatory response in the uterus induced by increased level of circulating lps triggers the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the uterus through the tlr4-nf-κb signalling pathway.
