BACKGROUND
paratuberculosis  is caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis . it is a ubiquitous chronic enteric wasting disease of ruminants, though in sweden the disease is rare or absent, thanks to successful control measures in the past. it is regarded as an exotic disease and falls under the swedish epizootic act, which means that in an event of an outbreak, measures must be taken promptly to combat the disease and to trace the origin of the outbreak  <cit> . when a positive case is identified, consequences for the farmer are grave and it is usually deemed necessary to slaughter the whole herd.

in the swedish paratuberculosis control program and in most of the swedish surveillances undertaken to monitor freedom from paratuberculosis, detection is based on culture. during the culture procedure, suspected colonies are picked and identified as map by pcr. other characteristics of the colony isolate act to confirm the identification made with pcr, namely acid-fast staining , growth characteristics  and dependence on mycobactin. the pcr methods generally used to identify and detect map are based on is <dig>  an insertion sequence considered specific for map  <cit> . is <dig> is a  <dig>  bp segment that lacks inverted terminal repeats and does not generate direct repeats in target dna  <cit> . it belongs to the same family of insertion sequences as is <dig>  is <dig>  and is <dig>  described in m. avium subsp. avium, m. avium subsp. silvaticum, and m. avium subsp. avium, respectively  <cit> .

pcr based on is <dig> has been used for direct detection of map, without primary culture, from milk, faecal specimens, semen, and human intestinal tissue  <cit> . apart from being the method of choice when speed is a priority, direct pcr is also preferred when map is difficult or impossible to cultivate  <cit> .

however, as is900-like genes have been found in other unrelated mycobacterium species, it is evident that the pcr systems used for is <dig> are not completely specific for map  <cit> . in a recent investigation, a nested pcr on is <dig> was shown to elicit false positive reactions from several mycobacterial strains  <cit> . it is therefore desirable to use alternative pcr systems to confirm a positive is <dig> pcr for map. this is useful when pcr identification cannot be confirmed by conventional culture-based methods, as is the case with direct pcr and pcr identification of growth in liquid cultures  <cit> .

in the present paper, two new real-time pcr systems that target other parts of is <dig> than does our standard  pcr  <cit> , and one real-time pcr targeting the f <dig> gene, specific for map  <cit> , were developed and evaluated as confirming tests on strains and clinical samples, previously found positive with our standard is <dig> pcr.

RESULTS
specificity
all map strains and isolates  proved positive with the primary pcr system and were confirmed by all three confirmatory systems. listed in table  <dig> are a variety of other mycobacteria, as well as a few other bacterial strains, that were tested with all four real-time pcr systems. with the primary pcr system, strain  <dig> proved positive, as previously reported  <cit> . an isolate of mycobacterium avium subsp. avium from a swedish horse and a mycobacterium kubicae-related isolate from cat gave weak positive reactions  with the is <dig> systems dh <dig> and dh <dig>  respectively. all the other strains tested negative. the f <dig> system dh <dig> gave no false positive reactions.

direct pcr on faecal samples
the procedure of first detecting map  with the primary system, then confirming positives with the three other new systems, worked well with direct pcr on clinical samples. when inhibitors were still present, which only was the case with samples from the external quality assessment , a dilution of the dna or a new preparation of the original sample would usually solve the problem and inhibition only remained in three of the samples. our method could detect map in  <dig> of the  <dig> valid positive samples in the  <dig> samples from the external quality assessment. when a sample produced a positive signal with the primary system, the same result was obtained with the confirmatory systems. however, as shown in table  <dig>  for  <dig> of  <dig> positive samples, re-runs with additional replicates had to be performed on f <dig> in order to pick up the dispersed dna, and for one culture-negative clinical sample with weak is <dig> pcr signals, dh <dig> failed to confirm the presence of map.

map could be detected in the spiked faeces using the primary system at a spiking level of  <dig> organisms/g and readily confirmed at the same concentration by all three confirmatory systems without the need for re-runs.

sensitivity on pure dna
the is <dig> systems mp, dh <dig>  dh <dig> and the f <dig> system dh <dig> yielded positive signals from dna suspensions with the concentrations  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> map genomes/μl respectively.

discussion
real-time pcr is a sensitive method for detection that eliminates the need to open the tubes when analysing the product, a stage in other pcr techniques that often constitutes a risk of cross-contamination. in particular, the sensitive method nested pcr involves a great risk of contaminating other samples when the product from its first reaction is being transferred to the second. real-time pcr minimises the risk of false positive results due to amplicon contamination.

another advantage of real-time pcr is that the use of probes enhances the specificity of the reaction, as an additional match with the target dna will be required for a positive signal. there is, however, still a risk for false positive results due to cross-reactions and positive results need to be confirmed.

to confirm pcr positives for map, one of the most extensively used methods is sequencing of a part of is <dig>  <cit> . however, with current generally available technology, sequencing may not be the most practical method. to obtain a successful sequencing reaction, a relatively large amount of pure amplicon is needed, which weakly infected samples might not yield. furthermore, sequencing is a laborious and expensive method  <cit> , not suitable for confirmation of numerous positive samples. the sensitivity of real-time pcr makes it easy to use the original template dna in reactions targeting other sites on is <dig> or on other genes. only when the template contains minute traces of map dna or is slightly pcr inhibiting, can problems arise, as discussed below.

the two systems dh <dig> and dh <dig> were selected on the basis of minimal sequential similarity to related is elements in other mycobacteria, such as the is <dig> equivalent in strain  <dig>  <cit> , and minimal self-complementarity. it appears that the sequential similarity to strain  <dig> predominates among the first  <dig> base pairs of is <dig>  which is also the area in which most of the systems suggested by the primer <dig> software are found. most previously described probe-based real-time pcr systems on the is <dig> gene are also located there and thus, they have little or no possibility to discriminate against  <dig>  <cit> . many potential systems could therefore be excluded, after which dh <dig> and dh <dig> were selected from the remaining oligos. in contrast to is <dig>  f <dig> has no known similarities to genes on other related organisms, which made the task of selecting suitable oligos for f <dig> less complicated.

it may appear simpler to change the primary system to one of the new systems, as they seem to be more specific than the mp system, but it should be noted that it is not certain that each of the other systems alone is entirely specific either. when using only one of the other systems, there is instead a risk of cross-reactions with other, unknown organisms with similarities in other parts of the map genome. for example, only a limited number of mycobacteria that do not grow at 37°c have been tested with f <dig> systems. the four systems eliminate many potential false positives by complementing each other, covering different parts of the is <dig> – or, as for the dh <dig>  a part of the f <dig> gene. however, the dh <dig> together with the primary system would probably be sufficiently specific for the routine application, where dh <dig> and dh <dig> only need to be used if dh <dig> fails, as discussed below.

previously published works on systems targeting f <dig>  <cit>  have reported specificity for map and application of their systems on altogether  <dig> strains of map and  <dig> other strains. our system dh <dig>  targeting f <dig>  did not produce any false positives when applied to  <dig> strains of map and  <dig> other strains. it is however less sensitive than the systems on is <dig>  as there are  <dig> to  <dig> copies of is <dig> in the map genome  <cit>  – and specifically  <dig> copies in strain k- <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with the results of our sensitivity tests. a suspension of  <dig>  map genomes/μl contains about  <dig>  is <dig> elements/μl. since real-time pcr has been reported capable of detecting a single copy of the target gene  <cit> , the successful detection of map in  <dig> to  <dig>  μl of this suspension was expected. as there is only one single copy of f <dig> in the map genome, the template volume had to contain at least  <dig> genome for successful detection. in fact, at such low concentrations, the probability of detection drops well below 100% if an insufficient volume is tested. use of poisson distribution shows a 63% theoretical probability of at least  <dig> genome observed in  <dig> μl at a concentration of  <dig> genome/μl. in  <dig>  μl of template, the probability of the same is 92% and when duplicates are run, it increases to  <dig> %. similarly, one can show that the probability of finding at least one is <dig> in duplicates of  <dig> μl of the above-mentioned suspension  is  <dig> %. in reality however, any detection system is less than optimal and an occasional target copy may be lost in the process, which is why one must expect lower probability of detection at these low concentrations. dna extracted from clinical samples may be highly complex and impure and have a slightly inhibitory effect on the pcr reaction in weak samples, even when a positive internal control indicates that inhibition should not be a problem.

in theory, the confirmatory systems could be combined and optimized to work as one single multiplex confirmatory pcr. nevertheless, the systems were kept separate, as competition of reagents can occur in a multiplex system, thus lowering its sensitivity  <cit> .

if a clinical sample proves positive with the primary system, yet any of the three confirmatory systems shows negative, an investigation into the cause of this divergence must be undertaken. if the primary system elicited a strong signal and all laboratory errors can be excluded, the likelihood is that the result was false positive, produced by some other mycobacterial strain. in that case, it would probably be of interest to further investigate this strain! the other possibility is of course that the negative system is not sensitive to all map strains, in spite of our extensive testing.

however, when the positive signal is very weak, there may be several reasons why some of the confirmatory systems show negative. because the genomes are sparse and attenuated in weak samples, a positive signal may be the outcome of low probability, thus impairing reproducibility. the confirmatory systems must then be employed again, this time using more replicates. in particular, the dh <dig> system on f <dig> will have a very low probability of detection at such concentrations. in rare cases, when even repeated analyses with additional replicates yield negative results, one will have to do without confirmation with f <dig> and instead take other aspects into account when judging the sample as true or false positive. in fact, it was notable that the f <dig> system could confirm the weakest detected level of spiked faeces  at the first attempt. this was probably because the weaker concentration  was very close to the detection level of the primary system. a few weak signals were yielded by the standard pcr, but with unacceptable high ct values. another considered explanation for occasional failure of any of the systems dh1- <dig> to confirm the primary system was that they might be more sensitive to inhibition than was the primary system, which contains the internal control plasmid, especially as the confirmatory systems were developed with the use of a template volume of  <dig>  μl instead of  <dig> μl. however, no such difference in robustness has yet been shown by the authors, and it is therefore assumed that they are equally sensitive to inhibition. ultimately, when trying to confirm a positive test, one must be certain that a weak signal in one single system is not due to laboratory contamination.

the false reactions given by the mycobacterium avium strain originating from horse and the mycobacterium kubicae-related isolate from cat are most likely not a problem, as they were much weaker than would be expected when using template from a resuspended colony. a high ct value  by confirmation of a normal-sized colony should alert the investigator that a cross-reaction or a contamination might have occurred. one could even argue that the cut-off ct value for pcr on colonies should be lower than for direct pcr on clinical samples, which would have made the above false positives negative. it was, however, not lowered, since that would also increase the risk of occasional dismissal of colonies that are very small or partly blended with contamination flora. in contrast, when higher ct values are expected, as when direct pcr is performed on clinical samples, the above strains are unlikely to yield positive signals. but if they still do, the remaining systems will show them to be false.

CONCLUSIONS
after validation on several mycobacterial strains and on faecal samples, our new confirmatory systems were found to be both sensitive and reliable. we recommend using the dh <dig> pcr on the f <dig> gene as the primary confirmatory test for pcr positives, but if it fails due to its lower sensitivity, then the dh <dig> and dh <dig> pcr systems can be used.
