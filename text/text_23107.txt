BACKGROUND
as a natural inhabitant of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and female vaginal tract in humans, enterococcus faecalis is normally considered a nonpathogenic microorganism. however, it is a common opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients, causing nosocomial infections. while our current understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the lifestyle shift from commensalism to virulence in enterococci remains an emerging area of research, the pathogenesis of e. faecalis is clearly nonetheless a complex multifactorial process that currently remains poorly understood. in this regard, we have previously identified the enterococcal leucine-rich protein a , a protein that possesses a leucine-rich repeat  domain and a carboxy-terminal wxl domain, which promotes non-covalent association to the bacterial surface  <cit> . elra is encoded by the elr operon , which encodes two other wxl surface proteins, a small lpxtg-motif protein and a putative transmembrane protein proposed to form cell surface complexes . expression of the elr operon is under the control of the positive regulator elrr  <cit> . the elra gene is poorly expressed in vitro, but it can be induced by complex biological milieu such as serum or urine, which suggests the tightly regulated control of elra expression in response to in vivo signals  <cit> . previously, we showed that inactivation of the elra gene resulted in significantly reduced virulence in a mouse model of peritonitis  <cit> . we also observed reduced secretion of interleukin- <dig>  upon in vivo infection with the Δelra mutant strain and we hypothesized that elra may be involved in this modulation, by stimulating host immune cells to counteract e. faecalis infection  <cit> .

macrophages are potent antigen presenting cells that play a key role in initiating an immune response against invading bacteria. in turn, some pathogens have evolved strategies in order to circumvent macrophage functions  <cit> . previous studies have shown that e. faecalis can survive in peritoneal macrophages better than other non-pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . in addition, it possesses mechanisms permitting escape from murine or human macrophages  <cit> . e. faecalis cell wall glycopolymers play a key role in the resistance to phagocytosis. in particular, capsular polysaccharide serotypes c and d contribute to complement evasion  <cit>  and rhamnopolysaccharide epa protects from phagocytic killing  <cit> , most likely by preventing uptake by macrophages as we recently showed in zebrafish model  <cit> .

in the present study, we sought to evaluate whether the expression of elra alone or that of the entire elr operon most influences the capability of e. faecalis to be phagocytized by the raw  <dig>  mouse macrophages in vitro. to circumvent the aforementioned low level of elra expression in vitro, a genetically modified e. faecalis strain harboring a constitutive promoter upstream of the elr operon  was constructed. the ability of this elr-overexpressing strain to be internalized was compared with a wild-type strain of e. faecalis, and with different isogenic-elr mutant strains, obtained by genetic manipulation of the e. faecalis p+-elra-e strain.

RESULTS
production of elra requires other gene of the elr operon
as previously discussed, e. faecalis elra protein is poorly expressed in vitro, but induced in vivo and is particularly important for e. faecalis virulence  <cit> . moreover, this protein could not be detected by western blot experiments in total protein extracts prepared from e. faecalis wild-type strain og1rf   <cit> . located immediately downstream of elra in the five-gene elr operon , there is a gene encoding a small protein with an lpxtg anchor motif , followed by two further proteins each possessing a carboxy-terminal wxl anchor motif , and finally a putative transmembrane protein , a member of the duf <dig> protein family  <cit> . a blast  analysis performed on the sequence of elrabcde using the ncbi non-redundant protein sequence  database revealed novel orthologs for the five proteins . the corresponding best matches for elra were observed with the hypothetical protein wp_ <dig>  of weissella halotolerans  and the hypothetical protein uc3_ <dig> of enterococcus phoeniculicola , followed by inla of l. monocytogenes as initially reported  <cit> . orthologs of proteins elrb to elre were detected in various species with the respective best matches for enterococcus pallens , enterococcus phoeniculicola , lactococcus garvieae and enterococcus avium , carnobacterium divergens and carnobacterium maltaromaticum . proteins possessing wxl domains, cognate putative transmembrane and lpxtg proteins have been proposed to form multicomponent complexes on the bacterial surface  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the recent work of galloway-pena et al. who showed interaction between e. faecium locus a-encoded wxl proteins and the cognate transmembrane protein in vitro  <cit> . in this context, the organization of the elr operon suggests that the four proteins  have a function related to elra. to address the role of elra in vitro while maintaining elr protein stoichiometry, we engineered an e. faecalis strain overexpressing the whole elr operon. this strain, e. faecalis p+-elra-e, was generated by replacement of the elr operon promoter region by the e. faecalis papha <dig> constitutive promoter   <cit>  . subsequently, to explore the role of elrb-elre in elra function, the p+-elra-e strain was used to generate: i) a strain expressing the elr operon but without elra: e. faecalis p+-Δelra, ii) a strain overexpressing only elra: e. faecalis p+-elra-Δelrb-e strain, and iii) a strain where the entire elr operon was inactivated: e. faecalis p+-Δelra-e . growth of the three strains was comparable , indicating that neither expression of elr operon nor parts of it impacted bacterial growth under the conditions tested.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the elra operon in strains used. in e. faecalis wt elra is followed by four genes encoding proteins of unknown function . the gene products are all predicted secreted proteins with an amino-terminal signal peptide. elra, elrc and elrd display a c-terminal wxl domain. elrb possess a carboxy-terminal lpxtg anchor. elre belongs to the duf <dig> family protein and has a predicted c-terminal transmembrane anchor. in p+-elra-e the natural elra promoter was replaced by the constitutive promoter of the kanamycin resistance gene . the p+-elra-e strain was used as recipient for all mutant constructions



we first tested elra production in each of the different strains by western blot analysis. as expected, elra was not detected in protein extracts prepared from wt, p+-Δelra, or p+-Δelra-e culture. strikingly, protein extracts prepared from p+-elra-e strain revealed a band of the expected size for elra , confirming that the endogenous pelra promoter is inactive in vitro, and that its replacement by a constitutive promoter allows expression of elra in vitro. no elra was detected in protein extracts prepared from the p+-elra-Δelrb-e strain , suggesting an important role for at least one of the four other proteins present in the elr operon in either the production or stability of elra. to corroborate this hypothesis and study elra transcription in the p+-elra-Δelrb-e strain, elra transcripts were analyzed by northern blotting hybridization using total rna prepared from the wt, p+-elra-e and p+-elra-Δelrb-e strains. as expected, elra transcript was not detected in the wt strain by northern blotting under laboratory growth conditions, confirming our previous results  <cit> . similar analyses in respect of the p+-elra-e and p+-elra-Δelrb-e overexpression strains resulted in strong hybridization signals corresponding to transcripts, of sizes of ~ <dig> and  <dig>  kb, corresponding to the predicted full-length, and the elrbcde-deleted elr operon transcripts, respectively . detection of elra transcripts in p+-elra-Δelrb-e strain strongly indicates a post-transcriptional control of elra expression, confirming the important role of at least one of the four other elr operon genes for either elra production or stabilization.fig.  <dig> detection of elra protein and elr transcript. a) western blot analysis of total protein extracts from wt and mutant strains of e. faecalis, that was performed using a  <dig> % sds-page and polyclonal rat anti-elra antibodies, is shown. band at ~80kd corresponds to the predicted size of elra, whereas the additional band represents a degradation product. b) northern blot analysis of elr operon performed with ~40 μg of total rna which was extracted from exponentially growing cells. names of strains analyzed are indicated at the top of each lane. probes used were elra-specific oligonucleotide probes. the estimated length of transcripts that agrees with their predicted sizes is shown on the right. below, ribosomal rnas were used as loading controls



overexpression of elr operon impairs phagocytosis
we then explored the effect of elr operon overexpression on the e. faecalis interaction with macrophages by monitoring phagocytosis of gfp-labeled e. faecalis strains by raw cells using flow cytometry analysis. firstly, we evaluated the phagocytosis dynamics of the e. faecalis wt strain at different multiplicities of infection  and decided to use a moi of 1: <dig> in which approximately 58 % ± <dig>  of macrophages were gfp positive after 30 min of interaction. this value was used as reference  in order to estimate the phagocytosis index  of the different e. faecalis mutant strains . operon inactivation  did not affect bacterial uptake when compared to the wt strain . in contrast, a significant reduction of phagocytosis was observed with p+-elra-e strain . although constitutive expression of the four other operon proteins  appeared to reduce phagocytosis , this reduction was not statistically significant . as expected, given that the p+-elra-Δelrb-e strain does not appear to produce elra , no difference in phagocytosis was observed when this strain was compared to the wt strain  . lower levels of uptake by phagocytosis of the strain p+-elra-e compared to the wt was confirmed by double-labeling fluorescence microscopy analysis . these results support a link between the expression of elr operon and the uptake of e. faecalis.fig.  <dig> phagocytosis of isogenic strains overexpressing full-length or partially deleted elr operon by raw macrophages. a) for all e. faecalis strains tested, the phagocytosis index  was calculated as average ± sem from three independent experiments. statistical significance was measured by anova and dunnett's multiple comparison test, ***p<  <dig> . b) adhesion index  of e. faecalis strains after treatment with cytochalasin d. ai was calculated as follows: ai = % of gfp-labeled macrophages after infection with the mutant strain x 100/% of gfp-labeled macrophages after infection with the wt strain. shown is the mean ± sem from two independent experiments performed in duplicate. c) scanning electronic microscopy  showing e. faecalis adhesion. micrographs of macrophages infected for  <dig> min with e. faecalis strains observed by electron scanning microscopy. the micrographs are representative of two independent experiments



overexpression of elr operon modifies bacterial adhesion
phagocytosis is initiated with the recognition of ligands on bacterial cell surfaces by receptors including scavenger receptors, glucan receptors, and integrins present on the membrane of macrophages, which leads to bacteria engulfment via an actin-dependent mechanism. to test whether the impairment of phagocytosis seen for the p+-elra-e strain correlated with reduced adhesion of the bacterium to macrophage cells, we used cytochalasin d , which inhibits phagocytosis, but does not prevent the initial step of bacterial adhesion  <cit> . macrophages were therefore infected  with either wt or p+-elra-e strains in the presence or absence of cytd, and the percentages of gfp+ macrophages were measured by flow cytometry analysis . comparison of forward scatter  and side scatter  values from uninfected cells  confirmed that macrophages were not altered by cytd . as shown in fig. 3b, p+-elra-e strain was 60 % less adherent to macrophages than the wt strain. these results are in agreement with scanning microscopy observations of infected macrophages, that showed a sharp contrast between adhesion of wt and p+-elra-e strains .

because proteins encoded by the elr operon demonstrate characteristics of surface proteins  and could form a surface complex, we hypothesized that overexpression of elr operon could result in the formation of surface structures, which in turn resulted in the inhibition of phagocytosis as observed in vitro. analyses of bacterial strains using transmission electron microscopy  and scanning electron microscopy revealed no differences at the surface structure level between the wt and the elr operon-overexpressing strain . this indicated that no major structural modification was detected under the tested conditions. since high expression levels of surface proteins can modify physicochemical properties of bacterial cell surface such as charge or hydrophobicity  <cit> , we compared the affinity of bacterial cells of wt and p+-elra-e strains to the solvents using a mats test as described by bellon-fontaine et al.  <cit> . both strains exhibited similar affinity for the apolar solvents decane  and hexadecane  and for the acidic solvent chloroform , indicating no major changes of the surface hydrophobicity upon elr overexpression. in turn, the affinity of the strain p+-elra-e for the basic solvent ethyl acetate  increased significantly compared to the wt , indicating that expression of elr operon enhances the negative charge of the bacterial cells. thus we hypothesize that poor adhesion of strain p+-elra-e may result from repulsive forces between the negatively charged macrophage membrane and bacterial surface, which is loaded with elr proteins.

overexpression of elr operon increases e. faecalis virulence
inactivation of elra reduces virulence in a mouse model of peritonitis  <cit>  and we show that overexpression of elr operon impairs phagocytosis in vitro. we hypothesized that overexpression of elr may enhance dissemination, and thus e. faecalis virulence. to test this hypothesis, we assessed the survival of mice following peritoneal infection with wt, p+-elra-e, or Δelra strains. mice were injected with three different doses of wt or mutant strains, and the mortality rates were compared. no differences in mortality levels were found when mice were infected with 109 cfu of wt or mutant strains . interestingly, mortality was significantly increased for mice infected with  <dig> x  <dig> and  <dig> x 108 cfu of p+-elra-e strain compared to wt and Δelra strains at 72 h post-infection . eighty five percent of the mice infected with  <dig> x 108 cfu of p+-elra-e strain died, whereas 45 % and 10 % mice died when infected with the wt and Δelra strains, respectively  . similarly,  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 % of the mice infected with  <dig> x 108 cfu of p+-elra-e, wt, and Δelra strains died, respectively  . these results show that overexpression of elr operon increases e. faecalis virulence. we also compared the dissemination of the wt, p+-elra-e, or Δelra strains in organs of mice at 24 h postinfection by determining bacterial loads . a  <dig> - and  <dig> -log <dig> increase in the bacterial counts in the liver and spleen, respectively, were observed for the p+-elra-e compared to the wt and Δelra strains, respectively, when mice were challenged with inocula of 1x <dig> cfu. similar trends were observed with inocula of 3x <dig> cfu , although to a somewhat lesser extent . these results indicate that the virulence phenotype correlates with higher dissemination of the strain p+-elra-e. the correlation between increased virulence and avoidance of phagocytosis observed in vitro corroborates our hypothesis that elr operon may be involved in the evasion of the immune response by e. faecalis. we previously linked the attenuated virulence of an elra deficient strain with the decreased organ burden and survival in peritoneal macrophages using an in vivo–in vitro infection model  <cit> . these new data suggest that expression of elra and/or elr operon contributes to the escape of e. faecalis from phagocytosis in vivo, promoting dissemination and enhancing virulence of the pathogen.fig.  <dig> effect of overexpression of elr operon on e. faecalis virulence. kaplan-meier survival analysis in a mouse peritonitis model with the e. faecalis wt strain , the Δelra strain , and the p+-elra-e strain . a total of  <dig> mice were infected intraperitoneally with ~ <dig> x  <dig>  or ~ <dig> x  <dig>  cfu of each strain. for pairwise comparisons of p+-elra-e / wt and p+-elra-e / wt, p values were <  <dig>  for each inoculum

discussion
previous studies have shown that e. faecalis survives into peritoneal macrophages better than non-pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . since then, e. faecalis virulence factors able to interfere with uptake and survival in macrophages have been described  <cit> . we previously linked the attenuated virulence of an e. faecalis strain deleted for elra with decreased organ burden and survival in peritoneal macrophages  <cit> . in this study, we show that overexpression of elr operon by e. faecalis confers resistance to phagocytosis by interfering with bacterial adhesion to macrophages. we also correlated e. faecalis avoidance of phagocytosis observed in vitro with increased virulence and dissemination in a mouse peritonitis model. these data contrast with our previous report that wt and Δelra strains were evenly phagocytosed  <cit> . nevertheless, these studies are difficult to compare since macrophage infections were performed differently . moreover, the expression level of elr proteins in vivo is unknown. the tight control of expression of the elr operon suggests that the operon may be required in specific conditions that remain to be identified  <cit> . the 162-fold increased level of erla transcript in e. faecalis strain mmh <dig> grown in urine  <cit> , supports that expression of elr proteins may vary in response to host-derived cues. we assume that elr operon may enhance e. faecalis virulence by promoting initial dissemination in the host after escape of bacteria from phagocytosis, but also by contributing to e. faecalis survival within infected macrophages depending on the tissues or cell types encountered by e. faecalis. from this study we propose that high-level expression of elr operon may, in some circumstances, occur in vivo and promotes escape of e. faecalis from phagocytosis.

the present study also revealed that elra requires at least one other elr gene to be expressed at a detectable level and confirmed that elra gene is cotranscribed with the other elr genes  <cit> . the elr operon is a typical gene cluster of wxl surface proteins that associate non-covalently to the peptidoglycan of low-gc gram-positive bacteria. the operonic organization of the elr operon and the need of at least one other protein encoded by elr operon for elra production in vitro further support the hypothesis that cell-surface proteins, encoded by the elr operon, may participate in the formation of a multicomponent complex at the surface as it has been previously proposed  <cit> . based on recent work by galloway-pena et al. who showed that wxl and duf <dig> proteins interact in vitro  <cit> , we believe that elra may be protected from degradation by interacting with at least another elr-encoded protein. if neither surface appendages nor modification could be observed upon overexpression of elr operon, other experiments are needed to establish if elr operon drives the formation of a surface complex in e. faecalis. nevertheless, overexpression of elr proteins seems to increase the negative charge of the bacterial surface, suggesting that e. faecalis evasion of phagocytosis by immune cells is driven by electrostatic repulsion. even if elr overexpression emphasizes the steric or charge hindrance by elr proteins in vitro, one cannot exclude that similar physicochemical changes occur in vivo in response to environmental cues  <cit> , and confers to the e. faecalis cells anti-adhesion properties that promote escape from phagocytosis. these in vitro findings are reminiscent of the acidic lrr protein slr from streptococcus pyogenes that is involved in phagocytosis evasion  <cit> , probably by enhancing the anti-adhesive properties of streptococcal cells. another possibility would be that high level of elr proteins sterically hinders e. faecalis-associated molecular patterns important for recognition by scavenger receptors. altogether, this work shows that expression of elr operon contributes to the escape of e. faecalis from phagocytosis, promoting dissemination and enhancing virulence of the pathogen. further investigations will focus on characterizing the precise role of each of the elr proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this work shows that high-level expression of elr operon by e. faecalis increases virulence and confers resistance to phagocytosis, probably through charge repulsion. consistently, the strain expressing elr operon displays stabilization of elra, further supporting that elr proteins form an extracellular protein complex as part of the virulence process. structural and functional characterization of the elr proteins will help to understand e. faecalis pathogenesis and provide clues on wxl- and associated proteins of low-gc gram-positive bacteria.
