BACKGROUND
highly pathogenic h5n <dig> avian influenza  viruses cause rare but severe disease in humans, with a case fatality rate approaching 60% among laboratory-confirmed cases. although direct human-to-human transmission of these viruses does not occur, recent evidence suggests that only a few molecular changes in the viral surface hemagglutinin  protein are sufficient to convert a non-transmissible hpai virus into one capable of droplet transmission in the ferret model  <cit> . these findings raise concern over the possibility of a hpai virus pandemic, and underscore the critical need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that control hpai virus pathogenicity. furthermore, the molecular dynamics of the host response and the complex interplay between virus-encoded determinants, host regulatory factors, h5n <dig> pathogenesis and severe lung disease is not well understood. such information is essential for the development of more effective intervention strategies aimed at ameliorating human disease and loss of human life resulting from hpai virus infections.

to unravel this interplay, we performed a systematic characterization of the global host response at the transcript and protein levels in lungs of mice infected by a panel of viruses that vary in pathogenicity, using a range of inoculation dosages. we also report a systematic collection of several corresponding phenotypic variables, including mouse body weights, lung virus titers, viral messenger rna, and viral genomic rna for each infected animal. our panel of viruses included the a/vietnam/1203/ <dig>  wild-type virus , the lower pathogenicity a/california/04/ <dig>  wild-type virus , two previously described vn <dig> mutant viruses – vn1203-haavir  <cit>  and vn1203-pb2-627e  <cit>  – and two newly generated vn <dig> mutant viruses – vn1203-ns1trunc and h5n <dig> vn1203-pb1f2del.

the h5n <dig> vn1203-wt virus is extremely virulent in mice  <cit> , and elicits a host response that contributes in part to its pathogenicity  <cit> . the h5n <dig> vn1203-haavir mutant virus harbors an altered multi-basic cleavage site – a virulence factor important for expanded tissue range  <cit>  – and exhibits restricted systemic viral spread due to limited ha susceptibility to furin protease activity. the h5n <dig> vn1203-pb2627e mutant possesses an amino acid substitution  at position  <dig> in the pb <dig> polymerase subunit. this mutation is known to confer increased polymerase activity in mammalian cells  <cit> , and also modulates anti-viral activity, apoptosis, and viral clearance  <cit> . our newly generated h5n <dig> vn1203-ns1trunc mutant virus produces a  <dig> amino acid c-terminal truncation in the effector domain of the ns <dig> host response antagonist protein. the ns <dig> protein inhibits rig-i activation  <cit>  and cellular mrna processing  <cit> , and also promotes pi3k activation  <cit> . the truncation results in the loss of the ns <dig> nuclear localization signal, a pi3k-binding motif, and binding domains that support interactions with the cellular nuclear proteins cpsf and poly -binding protein ii  – two factors that function in the 3’-end-processing of cellular pre-mrnas  <cit> . the newly generated h5n <dig> vn1203-pb1f2del mutant lacks expression of the pb1-f <dig> protein, potentially impacting an array of functions. pb1-f <dig> is a viral pathogenicity factor in mammals and birds  <cit> , and has been shown to modulate viral polymerase activity  <cit> , enhance lung inflammation  <cit> , modulate innate immune responses  <cit> , and demonstrate pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> . finally, the ca04-wt virus, which is an h1n <dig> isolate from the  <dig> pandemic season, induces lower pathogenicity in mice relative to vn <dig>  <cit> .

the extensive systematic analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic pulmonary responses to wild-type and mutant viruses we report here provides an unprecedented opportunity to assess the effect of specific virus attenuating mutations on global host responses in vivo, as well as the opportunity to directly examine the effects of dosage on the elicited host response. here, we sought to specifically address how the kinetics of the host responses to the different viral infections differs, and how this kinetics is related to the outcome of infection. to address this, we used a systems biology approach to analyze this dataset, and we developed a new geometrical representation method and two criteria – the magnitude and velocity coefficients – to visualize and quantify the kinetics of the host response to the different viral infections. using this approach, we have established that it is the magnitude and velocity of the early host response, rather than engagement of specific biological pathways per se, which mainly contributes to the observed pathogenicity of influenza viruses. importantly, we show that the molecular kinetic of the host response was associated with clinical disease severity and virus replication.

RESULTS
assembly of phenotypic variables and lung transcriptomic and proteomic profiles from mice infected with low and high pathogenicity influenza viruses
we collected  <dig> transcriptomic and  <dig> proteomic profiles from the lungs of 20–week old c57bl/ <dig> mice infected with ca04-wt, vn1203-wt, vn1203-haavir, vn1203-pb2627e, vn1203-ns1trunc, or vn1203-pb1f2del. mice were infected with a range of inoculation dosages  and lungs were harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection  to measure gene expression using oligonucleotide arrays and obtain proteomic profiles by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry . time-matched lung samples from mock-infected mice were collected and a total number of  <dig> transcriptomic profiles and  <dig> proteomic profiles are represented in our dataset.

throughout this article, we use the following definitions to describe the different conditions:  biological condition refers to all samples infected by the same virus, at the same inoculation dose, and from the same dpi;  dosage condition refers to samples infected by the same virus and at the same inoculation dose;  strain condition refers to all samples infected by the same virus. based on these criteria, the dataset is divided into  <dig> transcriptomic biological conditions and  <dig> proteomic biological conditions, representing  <dig> transcriptomic and  <dig> proteomic dosage conditions, and  <dig> strain conditions. additional file 1: figure s <dig> provides a schematic representation of the collected infected ‘omics profiles across the time course.

the different viruses can be ranked based on their pathogenicity as determined by median lethal dose  values in 6-week-old balb/c mice . the vn1203-wt  and the vn1203-pb1f2del  viruses were associated with the highest level of pathogenicity. the ca04-wt  and the vn1203-haavir  viruses were associated with the lowest level of pathogenicity. the vn1203-ns1trunc  and the vn1203-pb2627e  viruses showed an intermediate level of pathogenicity.

morbidity associated with infection, determined by mouse body weight loss , viral replication quantified by viral titration , viral messenger rna , and viral genomic rna  measured by quantitative rt-pcr were used to characterize the viruses in our study. these data were collected in the same experiment in which mouse lung tissues were collected for global transcriptome and proteome profiling. over the 7-day time course, vn1203-wt and all of the mutant viruses – with the exception of vn1203-pb2627e – exhibited similar, rapid weight loss culminating in a 20-30% reduction from initial body weights by 5– <dig> days post-infection . in contrast, both vn1203-pb2627e and ca04-wt displayed a more reduced rate of weight loss, which peaked at ~17% on day  <dig> post-infection. none of the mice survived to day  <dig> for the vn1203-wt infection at  <dig> pfu. virus titers were roughly distributed from low to high according to virus pathogenicity, with ca04-wt exhibiting the lowest mean titer in all four time-points and vn1203-wt exhibiting the highest . the one exception was titers observed in vn1203-haavir infections, which rivaled that of vn1203-wt in all time-points. both viral messenger rna and genomic rna production levels exhibited early  segregation into two groups, with vn1203-pb2627e and wt-ca <dig> displaying a 1– <dig>  log10–fold reduction in expression compared to all the other viruses . viral rna expression levels remained partially segregated on day  <dig>  and by day  <dig>  expression levels were more similar for all viruses in the panel.

in brief, influenza viruses used in this study exhibited a range of lethality, morbidity, and replication in mice. consistent with our expectations, the vn1203-wt virus was the most virulent, with a very low mld, the most rapid weight loss, and the highest virus replication at early dpi .

gene magnitude changes significantly distinguish the strain and biological conditions
deletion of pb1-f <dig>  k627e substitution in pb <dig>  elimination of the ha multi-basic cleavage site, and truncation of ns <dig> all decreased vn <dig> virulence in mice, and ca04-wt shows the lowest virulence in mice. we first aimed to determine whether the attenuated phenotype for each virus was the result of a different host response.

for each biological condition, differentially expressed transcripts  and proteins  compared to the mock-infected samples were identified and the overlap between the lists of det or dep of each virus were compared. figure 2a and b provide visual representations of the intersections between the lists of det and dep for the strain conditions using proportional euler-diagrams  <cit> . there were large degrees of overlap  between the strain conditions, between  <dig> % -  <dig> % and  <dig> % -  <dig> %, det and dep, respectively. the vn1203-pb1f2del strain condition had the smallest degree of overlap at the transcriptomic  level, and a relatively small degree at the proteomic  levels. notably, at  <dig> dpi, only one transcriptomic profile was available for the vn1203-pb1f2del strain condition inoculated at the  <dig> pfu concentration. hence, with only one sample available, the statistical identification of det lead to the identification of a fraction of false-positive, explaining this lowest degree of overlap observed for this strain condition at the transcriptomic level. the vn1203-wt strain condition also showed a relatively small degree of overlap at the transcriptomic  level; and the vn1203-ns1trunc strain condition showed the smallest degree of overlap at the proteomic  level compared to the other strain conditions. it should be noted that the strain conditions with the lowest degrees of overlap corresponded to the same strain conditions that triggered the largest amount of det and dep. similar large amounts of overlap have been identified between the dosage conditions, with degrees of overlap ranging from 68% to  <dig> % for the transcriptome and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the proteome. despite differences in clinical manifestation of the disease, these results suggest that the specific mutations in vn <dig> examined herein resulted in the induction of similar groups of transcripts and proteins compared to vn1203-wt, implying that magnitude and/or the kinetics of dysregulation of these overlapping genes might differentiate the viruses. figure 2c is a heatmap of the transcript expression values, ratioed to the mock-infected samples, of each infected sample of our dataset. this heatmap has been restricted to the lists of transcripts specific to each strain condition . we cannot distinguish any particular patterns or sets of transcript specific to any viral strain based on these transcript expression values. the transcript or protein subsets specific to each viral strain are the consequences of small variations in the host response, detected by the statistical procedures, that have no specific biological meaning.

functional enrichment analysis of the biological conditions also indicated a large degree of overlap in the host response – at least qualitatively – irrespective of the virus used to infect the mice. for instance, acute phase response signaling, antigen presentation pathway, lxr/rxr activation, and protein ubiquitination were pathways universally enriched . differences between the biological conditions were mainly explained by different degrees of enrichment scores, smaller for the early time-points post-infection and larger for the late time-points post-infection. similarly, within each viral strain, the enrichment scores were smaller for the lower infection concentrations and larger for the higher infection concentrations. overall, the qualitative similarity in the host transcriptomic and proteomic response to various influenza viruses suggested that the different viruses stimulate activation of common host response signaling mechanisms with different degrees of magnitude.

altogether, these results demonstrate that it is mainly the magnitude of expression changes within the same transcripts or proteins, rather than the induction of different gene sets, that differentiate the host response to ca04-wt, vn1203-wt, and h5n <dig> vn <dig> mutants. thus, isogenic viruses and different inoculation dosages likely trigger the same differentially regulated genes, but with different degrees of magnitude at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. this analysis was performed on the transcriptomic and proteomic levels independently, and in parallel. though we noted this magnitude effect was stronger in the proteomic dataset compared to the transcriptomic dataset, we found the same conclusions in each separate analysis.

the kinetics of the host response to vn1203-wt is captured by  <dig> main eigentranscripts and  <dig> main eigenproteins
to better characterize the host responses, and to be able to quantify their kinetics, we used a singular value decomposition analysis to capture and cluster transcripts and proteins associated with the system’s dynamics, as described in  <cit> . transcripts and proteins previously identified as differentially expressed in at least one biological condition that correlated with the eigentranscripts or eigenproteins  were identified using the pearson’s coefficient, with eigentranscripts or eigenproteins representing significant patterns of expression profiles, associated with the kinetics of the system. transcripts and proteins that did not correlate with any eigentranscript or eigenprotein, respectively, were not considered as significantly associated in the dynamics of the host response . this approach was used to examine the host response to vn1203-wt, independently of the inoculation dosage, that was then subsequently used as a reference to compare the vn <dig> mutants and ca04-wt. mock infected biological conditions were not used in the inference of eigentranscripts and eigenproteins, and biological conditions at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi were not used in the inference of the eigenproteins because of the relatively low levels of proteins detected as differentially expressed at these time-points.

we found a total of  <dig>  transcripts that correlated with  <dig> main eigentranscripts . there were a total of  <dig> proteins that correlated with  <dig> main eigenproteins . additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> provide the lists of transcripts and proteins associated with each eigentranscript and eigenprotein, respectively. the patterns of the eigentranscripts and eigenproteins identified in the vn1203-wt host response are represented in figure 3a and b. eigentranscript # <dig> was increasing over time, whereas eigentranscript # <dig> was decreasing over time. eigentranscript # <dig> showed a distinct pattern with a transient decrease at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, followed by an increase at  <dig> dpi. eigenprotein # <dig> was increased in abundance over time. in brief, the dynamics of the transcriptomic and proteomic host response were captured by  <dig> sets of co-expressed transcripts and  <dig> sets of co-expressed proteins with different patterns of variations.

for each set of transcripts and proteins, we identified over-represented biological functions, canonical pathways, and upstream regulators . eigentranscript # <dig> profile was enriched for transcripts associated with death receptor signaling, role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses, and apoptosis signaling, as well as the protein ubiquitination pathway, which has previously been observed in mouse lung responses following pandemic  <dig> influenza virus infection  <cit> . there was representation of transcripts encoding immuno proteasome components , ubiquitin-protein conjugates , and heat shock proteins  accompanying the protein ubiquitination pathway. eigentranscript # <dig> profile was comprised of transcripts predominantly associated with metabolic cellular processes including glutathione-mediated detoxification  and xenobiotic metabolism signaling . respiratory system development and function was an enriched biological function for eigentranscript # <dig> that included rarg and rarb transcripts, two ligand-dependent nuclear receptors that modulate an array of cellular responses related to cellular growth. eigentranscript # <dig> profile was enriched for transcripts associated with t cell responses, cd3g, zap <dig>  and icos, related to t cell receptor signaling, icos-icosl signaling in t helper cells, and regulation of il- <dig> expression in activated and anergic t lymphocytes. activated cd <dig> t cells in the lungs of mice infected with h5n <dig> virus are impaired in their ability to control viral replication linked to high pathogenicity  <cit> .

for each eigentranscript identified in the kinetics of the host response to h5n <dig> vn <dig> wild-type, the number of correlating transcripts is indicated. for each set of transcript the top  <dig> associated over-represented biological functions, canonical pathways, and upstream regulators are indicated. ingenuity pathway analysis was used to determine the top  <dig> bio function categories, canonical pathways, and upstream regulators. the functions annotation p-value range represents the range of p-values for the functions annotations associated with each bio function category. the p-value of overlap associated for each upstream regulator indicates the significance of the overlap between the genes targeted by the upstream regulator in the ipkb database and the experimental dataset. *upstream regulators with an apteryx signify a chemical reagent or chemical drug.

eigenprotein # <dig> profile had strong representation of proteins associated with acute phase response signaling , lxr/rxr activation , complement system  and coagulation system , cellular responses that are critical to host antiviral defenses. examination of proteins associated with eigenprotein # <dig> profile showed enrichment of proteins related to modification of reactive oxygen species. for example, there was enrichment of prdx <dig>  ptplad <dig>  and erp <dig>  suggesting heightened oxidative stress responses in the lungs of vn1203-infected mice. h5n <dig> infection causes acute lung injury and mice inoculated with inactivated h5n <dig> virus have compromised lung function, including altered lung elastance and increased ros and oxidized phospholipid production in the lung  <cit> . represented within eigenprotein # <dig> profile, were apoh and plg proteins involved in opsonization of cells, as well as the nadh dehydrogenase components ndufa <dig> and ndufa <dig> 

in conclusion, the three sets of co-expressed transcripts identified in response to vn1203-wt were associated with immune and apoptosis signaling pathways that increased over time, metabolic cellular processes that were largely decreasing, and t cell signaling pathways that exhibited a biphasic pattern. the three sets of proteins capturing the host response dynamics were related to host antiviral defenses, reactive oxygen species observed to increase as infection progressed, and opsonization. notably, upstream regulators highly enriched in each of the transcript or protein sets were identified , which confirmed that this method captures groups of co-regulated transcripts/proteins. importantly, there was an overlap of  <dig> signaling pathways that were found in both transcript and protein sets, including role of nfat in regulation of the immune response, apoptosis signaling and coagulation system, suggesting complementary sensitivity between the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles.

different doses of vn <dig> wt impact the magnitude and velocity of the pulmonary response to infection
to determine the effects of increasing dosage on the kinetics of the host response to vn1203-wt, we used multidimensional scaling   <cit>  as a visualization method and introduced two new criteria quantifying magnitude and velocity changes in the signature . each dot in the mds representations is the transcriptomic or proteomic profile of a biological sample, and pairwise distances between dots are proportional to the transcriptomic or proteomic distances  between the samples. the mds representation, calculated using the sets of transcripts and proteins associated with the vn1203-wt kinetics, highlighted interesting differences between the dosage conditions. while all samples from different dosages were close to the mocks at  <dig> dpi, the late time-points followed a similar curved trajectory. different magnitudes, defined as the distance of one biological condition to the mock-infected condition, and velocities, defined as the speed of the host response moving from one time point to the next time point, were observed for the three dosage conditions for both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. for example, infection with the highest dose of vn1203-wt virus  induced a similar change in host response at  <dig> dpi as vn1203-wt infection with the lowest dose  observed  <dig> days later at  <dig> dpi . compared to the transcriptomic profiles, the mds representation of the proteomic profiles showed more noise in the data . for instance, we observed that the variations within the groups were as high as the variations between groups. the proteomic samples collected at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection samples were closely clustered with the mocks. although we were unable to differentiate these samples, we observed a similar effect of dose on the trajectories at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, with the highest dose reaching the end of the trajectory more quickly compared to the lower doses. as such, the biological interpretations derived from the proteomic analysis have to be taken into careful considerations.

in order to quantify these magnitude and velocity effects in the kinetics of the host response, we defined two criteria, the magnitude coefficient  and the velocity coefficient . the mc quantifies the magnitude effect as the transcriptomic distance from one biological condition to the matched mock-infected condition. the vc quantifies the velocity effect as the speed of the transcriptomic host response moving from one time point to the next in the succession of infection. both the mc and vc were calculated based on the centroids  of the biological conditions and the transcriptomic distances  based on the signatures of transcripts associated with the kinetics of the host response to vn1203-wt . mc and vc were calculated only for the transcriptomic data, as we were unable to discriminate proteomic samples at early time-points , resulting in a lack of sensitivity for the analysis. we first observed that increasing the inoculation dose was related to an increase in magnitude of the host response. indeed, at each dpi, infection with  <dig> pfu triggered a lower mc compared to  <dig> pfu, while  <dig> pfu triggered the strongest mc. moreover, different inoculation dosages also resulted in different velocities of the host response changes. with regards to time, the greatest transcriptomic vc difference was found at  <dig> dpi, followed by the difference quantified between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. with regards to dosage, the lowest transcriptomic vc coefficient difference was found for  <dig> pfu and the greatest transcriptomic vc coefficient difference was found for  <dig> pfu.

these results show that a similar kinetic signature of  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig> proteins is dysregulated after infection with vn1203-wt at different doses, and that increasing dosages lead to higher magnitude changes of these transcripts/proteins and an increased velocity, especially between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.

mutations in vn <dig> impact the magnitude and velocity of the host response
having characterized vn1203-wt dynamics, we were now able to determine how each specific vn <dig> mutant altered the kinetics of the host responses. in particular, our aim was to better quantify the magnitude differences between wt and mutants that were introduced with figure  <dig>  we next developed a new geometrical representation method in order to compare the kinetics of the host response to the various vn <dig> mutants relative to the host response to vn1203-wt at the transcriptomic level. using the mds representation presented in figure 3c as a reference, we projected the transcriptomic profiles of samples infected by the four vn <dig> mutant viruses individually at  <dig> pfu  and, in the case of vn1203-ns1trunc and vn1203-pb1f2del, at  <dig> and  <dig> pfu dosages . while traditional mds methods project a set of high dimensional objects into a lower dimensional space for visualization purposes, the mds method that we developed allows for projection of additional objects over a predefined mds representation . thus, the resulting representation allows us to visualize the similarities and differences between the wt and mutant samples, and mc and vc allow us to quantify the kinetic changes in the host response related to magnitude and velocity, as previously described for vn1203-wt. the reference representation is named a mds reference map and the resulting projections are named mds projections. quantification of magnitude and velocity revealed different information about each mutant.

for vn1203-pb2627e, both the mds projection  and the mc and vc profiles  for the  <dig> dosage were similar to that observed for vn1203-wt at the  <dig> dosage. therefore, the main effect of the pb2-627e mutation on the host-response was to decrease it to a level similar to that induced by  <dig> times less vn1203-wt. this is consistent with the reduced replication we observed for vn1203-pb2627e in the current study  and with a previous study showing that the main effect of the pb2-627e mutation in the vn <dig> background was to reduce virus replication in the lung  <cit> .

the main effect of vn1203-haavir was also found to be an attenuated host response, with the vn1203-haavir  <dig> dosage exhibiting an mds projection and vc/mc profiles similar to that observed for vn <dig> wt at the  <dig> dosage . the only difference was that vc and mc at  <dig> dpi were slightly lower than the vn1203-wt, while no difference in weight loss or viral replication was observed between the two viruses at that dpi.

strikingly, whereas vn1203-pb1f2del vc and mc profiles at  <dig> pfu were intermediate between vn1203-wt  <dig> and  <dig>  at the highest dose , both the peak of vc at  <dig> dpi and the peak of mc at  <dig> dpi were higher than vn1203-wt at the same dose . it should be noted that both body weight loss and virus replication were similar at this dose between the vn1203-wt and this mutant . moreover, during the course of infection, four out of the five mice died between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, indicating a high virulence of this mutant at  <dig> pfu.

finally, the mc and vc profiles associated with vn1203-ns1trunc mutation largely changed at early dpi . at  <dig> dpi, these  <dig> coefficients were higher in the mutant than in the matched dose of the wt, but lower at  <dig> dpi . this was related to the enhanced, early expression  of transcripts directly involved in the innate immune response and inflammation , which was also reported previously  <cit> . it was interesting to find that this behavior was very similar to the ca <dig> at the highest dose . ca04-wt was used as a much lower pathogenicity comparator which confirmed that the main effect of increasing infection dose was to increase the magnitude of the host-response .

to summarize, each mutant of vn <dig> dysregulated the kinetic signature of  <dig>  transcripts with a specific dynamic in terms of both magnitude of changes , and speed at which they occurred . while vn1203-pb2e <dig> and haavir induced changes similar to those induced by  <dig> or  <dig> times lower doses of vn1203-wt respectively, vn1203-pb1f2del had a bimodal response with attenuation at  <dig> pfu, but an increase in both magnitude and velocity at  <dig> pfu. finally, vn1203-ns1trunc induced changes in the  <dig>  transcripts with a kinetics and magnitude more similar to ca04-wt  <dig> pfu than vn1203-wt.

magnitude and velocity of the host responses are associated with weight loss and viral titer
to determine whether the vc and mc were related to disease outcome and viral pathogenicity, we performed a correlation analysis between these coefficients and the phenotypic variables. all biological conditions were considered together in these analyses to assess the correlations with a large significance. for each biological condition, we determined the mean body weight of the animals, viral titer, viral messenger rna and viral genomic rna measurements in the lung, and calculated the difference between the means of any two consecutive time-points for viral titer , viral rna , and viral genomic rna . for each transcriptomic biological condition the associated mc, vc, mean body weight, Δ mean viral titer, Δ mean viral mrna, and Δ mean viral grna values are shown in additional file 5: table s <dig>  a significant association was found between mc and mean body weight , suggesting that the magnitude of host response is significantly associated with morbidity . the vc was not significantly associated with any criteria when considering phenotypic variables within a given time-point; however, the vc was significantly associated with Δ mean viral titer , Δ mean viral mrna , and Δ mean viral grna  at the previous time-point. this suggests that the velocity of the host response can be predicted by changes in viral replication at the preceding time-point.

in conclusion, the magnitude of changes in the host response of the  <dig>  transcripts was correlated with morbidity at similar time-points, while the velocity of these changes between two time-points was associated with extent of changes in viral replication at previous time-points.

discussion
highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n <dig> virus is known to induce aberrant host responses leading to severe immunopathology in the lung. in particular, the potent pro-inflammatory response, commonly referred to as ‘cytokine storm’, is the suspected cause of acute lung injury  <cit> . genomic evidence from animal model systems shows hpai h5n <dig> viruses strongly enhance cytokine and chemokine transcriptional responses compared to seasonal influenza viruses  and  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza viruses  <cit> . here, we utilized a mouse model to study the system dynamics of h5n <dig> infection, comparing and contrasting the effects of increasing dosage and different previously described and newly generated viral mutants with varying degrees of pathogenicity toward the kinetics of pulmonary responses. using a systems approach, we present a temporal analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles measured from mouse lung samples collected during the acute phase of infection in order to better understand both dose-dependent and temporal mechanisms of host responses to influenza infection.

we report that the wild-type and mutant viruses differentially regulate a common set of transcripts and proteins, demonstrating a large degree of overlap in the host response among the different strain and dosage conditions. regardless of the virus genetic change, we show that the host response is mainly impacted by the magnitude of gene expression and the speed at which these changes occur for this core set of transcripts, as opposed to transcriptomic differences explained by each specific mutation. we identified three main eigentranscripts associated with host immune mechanisms, including metabolic cellular processes and t cell signaling pathways, and three main eigenproteins associated with host antiviral defenses. through a new geometric representation method and two criteria , we were able to visualize and quantify the magnitude and velocity kinetic effects of the host response to wild-type and mutant h5n <dig> vn <dig> viruses, which were influenced by both the infection dosage and specific modifications to key h5n <dig> virulence determinants. intriguingly, two newly generated h5n <dig> vn <dig> mutant viruses, vn1203-pb1f2del and vn1203-ns1trunc, had the most distinct profiles, with apparent displacement relative to all other viruses at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi, respectively. the divergent kinetic effects occurred mostly at early time-points , and we observed analogous kinetic effects with different doses of low pathogenicity  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza virus . importantly, we demonstrate that the magnitude and velocity kinetic effects were associated with clinical disease severity and virus replication. specifically, mouse weight loss correlated with the magnitude of the host response, and infectious viral particle production at a given time point correlated with the velocity of the host response at the next time-point.

compared to the differentially expressed transcripts, changes in protein abundance were less apparent, due in part to inherent noise in the data that makes computational analyses of proteomic measurements particularly challenging  <cit> . however, we have been able to identify the same overall kinetic pattern, as observed with the transcriptomic data. due to this variability, we have not used the proteomic data to quantify the magnitude and velocity effects and the biological interpretations we have drawn from the proteomic analysis have been done with careful consideration.

previous work by chang and coworkers, using a compendium of about  <dig> publicly available transcriptomic profiles of mouse lungs, showed differences in pathogenicity among respiratory viruses were explained in part by the changes in magnitude of gene expression  <cit> . however, due to constraints of the meta-analysis, time was not taken into consideration. moreover, the different microarray platforms and mouse genetic backgrounds used in the different datasets introduced noise into the analysis. here, we have expanded upon the findings by chang et al. through a kinetic analysis that incorporates the dimension of time, uses a single mouse genetic background and isogenic respiratory viruses that differ based on mutations to known pathogenicity determinants. transcriptomic and proteomic samples were collected in a systematic manner to generate a comprehensive dataset that provides a powerful resource for modeling pathogen-host interactions. the large sample number allows to infer co-expression and co-regulation networks for identification of unknown associations and dynamic interactions between biological components. moreover, the extensive collection of sampled time-points allows to model causality of the biological system for discovery of novel biological events. in addition, a large panel of machine learning and data mining algorithms can be used, trained and tested based on this assembled dataset. while our study focuses on acute responses to h5n <dig> virus, other transcriptomic datasets, such as the one reported by pommerenke and coworkers, encompass acute and adaptive host responses to influenza virus  <cit> . it will be important to consider changes during adaptive host responses to fully appreciate the impact of magnitude and velocity kinetic effects on the outcome of viral infection.

several genomic studies have examined host responses to h5n <dig> virus in mice for a deeper understanding of molecular events impacting viral pathogenesis and dissemination. cillóniz and coworkers demonstrated robust transcriptional changes of inflammatory response genes, including upregulation of inflammasome genes , in response to h5n <dig> vn <dig> compared to  <dig> pandemic influenza virus at day  <dig> post-infection  <cit> . investigation of the host response to viruses possessing specific mutations has also been investigated. for example, fornek et al. showed that the h5n <dig> influenza a/hong kong/486/ <dig> virus containing amino acid substitution e627k in pb <dig> upregulated tcr complex genes  in the lungs of infected mice at day  <dig> post-infection  <cit> . it must be noted that the pb <dig> mutation is not the only difference between these two viruses. our kinetic analysis further supports the likelihood of impaired t cell responses to h5n <dig> infection. in a separate study, a recombinant virus expressing h5n <dig> pb1-f <dig> n66s compared to the wild-type recombinant virus showed differences in the timing of interferon-stimulated gene expression in mouse lung  <cit> . proteomic analysis of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with h5n <dig> virus have also been investigated and changes in protein abundance of components associated with protein synthesis machinery have been observed as early as  <dig> hour post-infection  <cit> .

importantly, these kinetic properties of the host response may not be fully captured by traditional statistical methods that largely depend on different assumptions and applied criteria. for instance, methods used for the identification of differentially expressed genes and over-represented pathways can be negatively impacted by 1) gene magnitude changes, via the fold-change cutoff, 2) the dynamics of the host responses, as biological condition comparisons are usually performed within a given time-point, and 3) the variability of the biological conditions, via the p-value cutoff. for example, the comparison of the vn <dig> wild-type condition at  <dig> pfu and at  <dig> dpi with the vn1203-pb1f2del condition at  <dig> pfu and at  <dig> dpi will detect a large number of differentially expressed transcripts or proteins . on the other hand, a comparison of the vn <dig> wide-type condition at  <dig> pfu and at  <dig> dpi with the vn1203-pb1f2del condition at  <dig> pfu and at  <dig> dpi will detect a smaller number of differentially expressed transcripts and proteins. however, in both cases, the virus triggered the same host response mechanisms, but with different kinetics.

compare to more traditional analysis methods, the singular value decomposition analysis that we used for the kinetics analysis has several advantages that we exploited here. this analysis is based on an unsupervised method and does not require pulling the samples into distinct groups . this unsupervised aspect was crucial in our analysis because of the shifts on the host response that we described in this study. using this svd analysis strategy, we have been able to successfully capture the kinetics pattern of the host response system to vn <dig> wild-type without having to group the samples into particular bins. moreover, the kinetic patterns of the sub-biological mechanisms identified  can be naturally displayed with this analysis strategy. these representations of eigentranscripts and eigenproteins show in a very concise way the kinetics profiles of all the associated transcripts and proteins. for example, we have been able to clearly observe the transient profile of transcripts associated with t-cell responses. with more traditional methods , this kind of representation is not systematic and could produce large unintelligible representations.

the mds reference maps and projections representations that we developed and used in the context of this study were particularly useful to drive our analysis. by using the vn <dig> wild-type virus -omics profiles as a reference representation, we have been able to observe the behavior of the host response to the other variants. traditional visualization representation methods do not naturally allow fixed positions of a subset of high-dimensional objects. in the context of the development of novel visualization methods  <cit> , we showed the relevance of this approach for the analysis of large datasets.

CONCLUSIONS
the emergent properties of a biological system are dynamic and best comprehended by examining the system through the sum of its individual components  <cit> . through a systems biology approach, we have demonstrated the importance of the kinetics of the host response to h5n <dig> pathogenesis. magnitude and velocity represent emergent properties of the system that are best captured using an expanded time-course, multiple doses and more than one mutant virus. therefore, changes in gene expression induced by wild-type and mutant virus are not necessarily specific to a particular mutation, but rather encompass kinetic changes where increasing viral dosage is found to proportionally increase the magnitude coefficient and impact the timing of peak velocity coefficient during infection. knowledge of the timing of host response changes will have important implications for treatment administration, particularly early in infection.
