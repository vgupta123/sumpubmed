BACKGROUND
leaf senescence is complex in that it involves many highly organized molecular and cellular processes such as the disintegration of chloroplast, down-regulation of photosynthesis, degradation of nucleic acid, protein, and lipid and recycling of nutrients. and as the final stage of leaf development, leaf senescence eventually leads to leaf death, which is controlled by both internal and external factors. the internal factors include age, phytohormone levels and developmental processes, and the external factors mainly comprise environmental/biological stresses such as extreme temperature, shading, drought, wounding, nutrient limitation, pathogen attack and oxidative stress by uv-b irradiation and ozone  <cit> .

nacs  are plant-specific transcription factors and are widely found in plants. it has been reported that many nacs show enhanced expression during dark-induced and natural leaf senescence in arabidopsis  <cit> , and may play a central role in mediating leaf senescence. the senescence-controlling nac gene nam-b <dig> was also reported to be associated with the contents of grain protein, zinc, and iron in wheat  <cit> . anac092/atnac2/ore <dig>  whose expression correlates with senescence, positively regulates aging-induced cell death in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . the oresara <dig>  mutant, which lacks the functional anac092/atnac2/ore <dig> gene, displays a delayed leaf senescence phenotype  <cit> . an aba-responsive nac transcription factor vnd-interacting <dig> , whose expression shows a leaf aging or leaf longevity-dependent expression pattern, may mediate the crosstalk between the salt stress response and the leaf aging process  <cit> . atnap is strongly up-regulated during leaf senescence in arabidopsis, and atnap null mutants show a delayed leaf senescence phenotype, whereas the inducible overexpression of atnap causes precocious leaf senescence  <cit> . recent studies have shown that atnap can bind to the promoter region of senescence-associated gene <dig>  to form a aba-atnap-sag <dig> protein phosphastase 2c regulatory chain for controlling stomatal movement and water loss in senescing arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . many nac transcription factors can be induced by leaf senescence, but their particular roles in leaf senescence still remain largely unknown.

many studies have revealed that ja and its derivatives play important roles in regulating the response to leaf senescence in plants. meja and its precursor ja were first isolated in oat and shown to promote senescence in detached oat leaves, suggesting that jasmonates might serve as powerful promoters to induce plant senescence  <cit> . ja-induced leaf senescence is accompanied by the increased expression of several enzymes involved in ja biosynthesis and the decreased expression of the genes involved in photosynthesis  <cit> . in addition, ja can activate the expression of many senescence-regulated genes such as atwrky <dig> <cit> , osakagal <cit>  and esr/esp <cit> , which play major roles in leaf senescence. leaf senescence and meja can induce the expression of osakagal, which encodes a chloroplast alkaline α-galactosidase involved in the degradation of digalactosyl diacylglycerol during leaf senescence in rice  <cit> . exogenous application of ja to attached and detached leaves promotes leaf senescence in arabidopsis but does not induce leaf senescence in the ja-insensitive mutant coi <dig>  suggesting that the ja-signaling pathway is required for ja to promote leaf senescence  <cit> . furthermore, ja promotes h2o <dig> accumulation in the leaves of ja-sensitive cultivar tn <dig> seedlings to accelerate the process of senescence but not in the leaves of ja-insensitive cultivar tng <dig>  <cit> . many ja and senescence-regulated genes have been identified, yet how the crosstalk between ja signaling and senescence occurs remains to be thoroughly understood.

in this study, we isolated and characterized the ja-induced senescence-associated gene osnap, which encodes a nac transcription factor in rice. we generated the osnap overexpression and rnai lines and analyzed the leaf senescence process of them. we also determined the endogenous ja levels and checked the expression of the genes encoding the enzymes of the ja biosynthetic pathway in the osnap transgenic lines and wild-type plants. studies of these lines indicated that osnap acts as a positive regulator of the ja pathway to mediate the leaf senescence process in rice.

RESULTS
characterization of osnap in rice
there are  <dig> predicted nac proteins  <cit>  and  <dig> putative nac or nac-like proteins  in rice  <cit> . later computational analyses showed that there are at least  <dig> osnac genes in the rice genome  <cit> . and phylogenetic analysis showed that there are  <dig> osnacs which closely cluster with atnap: os03g <dig> , os12g <dig>  os11g <dig> , os03g <dig> , os01g <dig> , os07g <dig> , os11g <dig> , os07g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os07g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os05g <dig> and os01g <dig>  . digital expression profile analysis showed that the expression levels of os07g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os07g <dig> and os01g <dig> are low and even undetectable in leaves. and other  <dig> genes are expressed in leaves, but only the transcripts of osnap, osnac <dig> and osnac6/snac <dig> in leaves are up-regulated during leaf senescence  <cit> . however, several studies have demonstrated that osnac <dig> and osnac6/snac <dig> are involved in stress tolerance in rice  <cit> . we therefore decided to examine the potential role of osnap in the leaf senescence of rice.

the full-length cdna of osnap was isolated for further functional analysis. osnap cdna  encodes a protein with  <dig> amino acids. sequence analysis suggested that osnap is identical to onac <dig>  which belongs to the nac family in rice  <cit> . twelve sequences were obtained from arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa, populus trichocarpa, gossypium hirsutum, glycine max, bambusa emeiensis, brachypodium distachyon, sorghum bicolor, hordeum vulgare, and zea mays by blastp search. the resulting phylogenetic relationships showed that each of them contained a-e subdomains , which is consistent with the results previously reported  <cit> .

subcellular localization of osnap
to determine the subcellular localization of osnap, a construct expressing osnap linked to gfp under the control of the maize  ubiquitin promoter was transiently transfected into onion cells. the fluorescence was observed only in the nuclei, which was confirmed by dapi staining . to further study the localization of osnap, arabidopsis cell protoplasts were co-transformed using 35s::osnap-gfp and 35s::ghd7-cfp. as shown in figure 1b, gfp fluorescence from osnap overlapped with the cfp signals from ghd <dig>  <cit> , which further confirmed that osnap localizes to the nucleus.

biochemical function of osnap in yeast
some nac transcriptional factors bind to the nac recognition site -like sequence in the oserd <dig>  promoter to activate his reporter gene expression  <cit> . to detect whether osnap can bind to this sequence, the orf of osnap was fused to gal4-ad in the pgadt <dig> vector and co-transformed with the phis2-cis reporter vector  <cit>  into the y <dig> yeast strain . the combinations of pgad-rec2-53/p53his and pgad-osnap/p53his <dig> were used as the positive control and negative control, respectively. the result showed that all of the combinations, including pgad-osnap/phis2-cis, the positive and negative control, could grow on the sd/leu-/trp-/his- medium without 3-at. however, when the sd/leu-/trp-/his- medium was supplemented with 30 mm 3-at, the transformed pgad-osnap/phis2-cis and the positive control grew, whereas the negative control did not , indicating that osnap binds to the nacrs-like sequence in yeast.

several nacs not only act on gene promoters but also have transactivation activity  <cit> . to determinate whether osnap has activation capacity, we tested the transactivation activity of osnap in yeast. the full-length and partial fragments of osnap were fused to the gal <dig> dna binding domain in the pgbkt <dig> vector and the resultant vectors were co-transformed with pgadt <dig> into the ah <dig> yeast strain . the combinations of phis53/pgad-rec2- <dig> and pgbdk7/pgadt <dig> were used as the positive control and negative control, respectively. it was observed that all of the co-transformants grew well on the sd/leu-/trp- medium, but only the cells transformed with phis53/pgad-rec2- <dig> and pgbd-osnap-tr/pgadt <dig> could grow on the sd/leu-/trp-/his-/ade- medium , suggesting that the transactivation domain of osnap is located in the c-terminal transcriptional regulatory  domain of the protein.

expression pattern of osnap
to determine the expression profile of osnap, qrt-pcr assays using total rna samples from flag leaves of different developmental periods were performed. the results showed that the transcript of osnap was associated with the senescence of leaves . to better understand the osnap expression pattern, the osnap promoter was fused to the gus reporter gene and introduced into the zhonghua  <dig>  immunohistochemical staining of gus showed that osnap was mainly expressed in callus, leaves, sheaths, nodes, internodes and mature seeds . in leaves, gus activity increased gradually with leaf senescence , which is consistent with the qrt-pcr result .

in addition, qrt-pcr analysis showed that the expression of osnap was continuously increased during meja treatment , indicating that the expression of osnap was induced by meja treatment.

effect of the overexpression of osnap on leaf senescence at the grain-filling stage
because strongly up-regulated expression of osnap was observed during leaf senescence in rice , we decided to investigate the role of osnap in leaf senescence. the osnap gene, which was driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter, was introduced into zhonghua  <dig> by an agrobacterium-mediated transformation approach.  <dig> single-copy insertion lines were obtained based on southern blot analysis . the result of the northern blot analysis showed that the expression levels of osnap were substantially elevated in these lines . all the plants with increased expression levels of osnap exhibited visible yellowing phenotype in leaves during the late stages of seed maturation when compared with the wt plants . three osnap transgenic lines  were selected for further study. the expression levels of osnap in these lines were validated using qrt-pcr . no significant difference was observed between the transgenic lines and wt plants during the vegetative and early reproductive stages. however, at  <dig> dah, the flag leaves of the high-expressing lines  showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype when compared with those of the low-expressing line  and wt plants . the yellowing in the leaves became more apparent at  <dig> dah . and the phenotype was correlated with the increasing expression levels of osnap . the time-course changes in the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of the flag leaves were compared between the osnap-overexpressing lines and wt plants after heading. the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate showed no significant differences at around  <dig> dah . however, the high-expressing lines  exhibited more reduction in chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate compared with the low-expressing line  and wt plants at around  <dig> and  <dig> dah , suggesting an accelerated leaf senescence phenotype. taken together, these findings indicate that the overexpression of osnap leads to accelerated leaf senescence in rice.

effect of knock-down of osnap on leaf senescence in rice
to explore the physiological role of osnap in leaf senescence, we generated an osnap rnai construct and introduced it into zhonghua  <dig>   <dig> single-copy insertion lines were verified by southern blot analysis . northern blot analysis showed that the osnap transcripts in senescing leaves decreased in most of the transgenic plants . the leaves of rnai transgenic lines appeared normal during the vegetative and early reproductive stages, but displayed appreciably higher greenness compared with that of wt plants during the late stages of seed maturation. two transgenic lines  were selected for further analysis. during the grain-filling stage, an obvious yellowing was observed in the leaves of the wt plants but not in those of the transgenic lines rnai- <dig> and rnai- <dig> , suggesting that the senescence process was markedly delayed. we further checked the chlorophyll levels in the flag and second top leaves. the chlorophyll levels in the flag and second top leaves of rnai- <dig> and rnai- <dig> were sharply higher than in those of the wt plants . qrt-pcr analysis validated that rnai- <dig> and rnai- <dig> transgenic lines showed a significant reduction in osnap transcript levels . and the greater the reduction in osnap transcript levels was, the higher the chlorophyll content became in the leaves of rnai transgenic lines compared with in those of the wt plants , which indicated that the delayed leaf senescence phenotype was related to the reduction of the expression level of osnap. osdos acts as a negative regulator of leaf senescence since its expression is down-regulated during leaf senescence  <cit> , which makes osdos an ideal molecular marker for leaf senescence in rice. we further analyzed the transcript of osdos by qrt-pcr analysis. as shown in figure 5e, the expression of osdos was markedly higher in the leaves of rnai- <dig> and rnai- <dig> than in those of the wt plants, which further suggested that leaf senescence was remarkably delayed in osnap rnai transgenic plants.

relation between the senescence phenotype in osnap transgenic plants and endogenous ja content
osnap expression was increased gradually by meja treatment , implying that osnap may be involved in the ja pathway in rice. to assess the function of the osnap gene in the ja pathway, a meja treatment assay was performed on osnap-overexpressing lines and wt plants. there was no significant difference observed in the shoot and root length under normal conditions . the growth of osnap-overexpressing lines and the wt plants was inhibited under meja conditions, but the shoot and root length of high osnap-overexpressing lines  was significantly longer than that of the low-expressing line  and wt plants . however, no difference in shoot and root length was observed between the seedlings of the rnai lines and the wt plants . these findings indicated that the tolerance of osnap-overexpressing lines to meja treatment was enhanced.

to further explore the function of the osnap gene in the ja pathway, we measured the endogenous ja levels in osnap transgenic lines and wt plants. as shown in figure 7a, ja levels were up-regulated in osnap-overexpressing transgenic lines, but sharply down-regulated in rnai lines compared with those in wt plants whether at the seedling or mature stage. we further analyzed the expression levels of the genes involved in the ja biosynthetic pathway by qrt-pcr in osnap transgenic lines and the wt plants. among these genes, lox <dig> and aoc had more significantly increased transcripts in the osnap-overexpressing plants than in wt plants , while the genes that encode enzymes for ja biosynthesis, including aos <dig>  aoc and opr <dig> showed remarkably decreased expression levels in the osnap rnai lines compared with the wt plants . therefore, the phenotypes of the osnap transgenic plants may at least be partially due to the endogenous ja levels.

discussion
important role of osnap in regulating leaf senescence in rice
nac proteins are unique transcription factors involved in different developmental processes including senescence in plants  <cit> . approximately one-fifth of nacs  are present in the senescence ests  in arabidopsis  <cit> . about 46% of the up-regulated genes in anac092/atnac2/ore1-overexpressing transgenic plants are senescence-associated genes  <cit> . these findings suggest that nac proteins may play crucial roles in senescence.

in this study, we identified a member of the nac transcription factors osnap, which plays an important role in regulating leaf senescence in rice. firstly, the transcript of osnap was up-regulated during natural leaf senescence . secondly, osnap-overexpressing lines displayed an accelerated leaf senescence phenotype and showed a reduced net photosynthetic rate coupled with a decline in chlorophyll content during the reproductive growth stage . in addition, osnap rnai lines showed a markedly delayed leaf senescence, which was confirmed by the higher expression of osdos . finally, as the homolog of atnap in rice, osnap can restore the delayed leaf senescence phenotype in atnap mutant to a normal wt phenotype  <cit> . these results suggest that osnap is associated with leaf senescence in rice.

the role of osnap in the crosstalk between senescence and the ja pathway
ja and its derivatives are known as endogenous modulators of many physiological processes in plants including senescence  <cit> . our analysis revealed that the expression level of osnap was up-regulated with meja treatment , suggesting that osnap may be involved in the ja pathway. there are two important processes in the ja pathway: ja biosynthesis and ja signal transduction  <cit> . accelerated or hindered ja biosynthesis can lead to more rapid or delayed senescence in plants. osnap overexpression resulted in accelerated senescence in transgenic rice and it was evident from the decreased chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate , which was correlated with accumulation of endogenous ja content and increased transcript levels of ja biosynthesis genes . qrt-pcr results showed that the expression of the ja biosynthesis gene lox <dig> was increased  <dig> to  <dig> fold in the osnap-overexpressing lines compared with in the wt plants . ja levels were increased during senescence in osnap-overexpression transgenic lines and the wt plants, which is in accordance with previous conclusions  <cit> . on one hand, ja can induce the expression of the key enzymes of chlorophyll breakdown including chlorophyllase  <cit> , promoting the loss of chlorophyll in leaves. on the other hand, ja can also induce the expression of many senescence-associated genes to promote senescence  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the accelerated leaf senescence observed in osnap-overexpressing plants might have resulted from an increase in the endogenous ja levels. in addition, osnap rnai transgenic plants displayed a marked delay of leaf senescence . ja in these lines declined dramatically to non-detectable levels , and the transcripts of the genes encoding enzymes in the ja biosynthesis pathway, including aos <dig>  aoc and opr <dig>  dropped sharply . the delayed yellowing during natural senescence in osnap rnai transgenic plants at the grain-filling stage may be due to the reduced ja production. hence, osnap may act as a positive regulator of leaf senescence by regulating the ja biosynthesis pathway.

besides ja biosynthesis, a block in ja signal transduction can also alter the process of senescence. the mutant coi <dig>  whose ja signaling has been impaired, exhibits delayed senescence phenotype  <cit> . rubisco activase  is a coi1-dependent ja-repressed protein and it has been shown that a loss-of-function mutation of rca leads to typical signs of senescence  <cit> . osdos is a nucleus-localized ccch-type zinc finger protein in rice that acts as a negative regulator of the ja pathway and senescence process  <cit> . the transcripts of osdos were significantly higher in osnap rnai lines than in the wt plants , suggesting that the ja signaling pathway was impaired. in addition, meja inhibition was significantly lower in the osnap high-expressing lines compared with in wt plants, suggesting that the overexpression of osnap enhances the resistance to exogenous meja in rice . these results indicate that ja signaling pathway is involved in the osnap-mediated senescence process.

the nac transcription factors can bind to specific cis-elements of target gene promoters, and can thus regulate gene transcription. for example, the mir319-regulated tcp  transcription factors regulate the ja biosynthesis gene lox <dig>  controlling ja content and affecting leaf senescence  <cit> . and atnap can bind to the promoter region of sag <dig>  which negatively regulates the aba signaling pathway that modulates stomatal movement and water loss in senescing leaves  <cit> . in the present study, aba did not have significant effects on osnap expression levels , while meja gradually induced the expression of osnap . in addition, osnap was able to bind to the nacrs-like sequence , and the c-terminal region had transactivation activity in yeast . it’s worth noting that there were a number of putative nac recognition sequences  and core dna binding sequences  in the 1 kb region upstream of the ja biosynthesis-related genes . for these reasons, it can be concluded that osnap may interact with ja biosynthesis genes directly or indirectly. further experiments, particularly a screen for the interacting proteins, will be necessary to determine the specific roles of osnap in ja signaling and leaf senescence.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, a nac transcription factor osnap was isolated and characterized in rice, and osnap was identified as a key mediator between the ja pathway and leaf senescence. in addition, the expression of osnap was detected in the callus, sheath, mature seed, node and internode besides the leaves , suggesting that osnap plays important roles in diverse biologic processes in rice. nevertheless, further analyses are required to clarify the specific roles of osnap in rice.
