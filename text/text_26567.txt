BACKGROUND
one characteristic feature of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes  is the economical gene organization. vertebrates usually lack mitochondrial intergenic sequences of any appreciable size other than the approximately 1-kb control region  and the 30-bp origin of light  strand replication . the cr harbors the origin of heavy  strand replication  and initiation sites for h-strand and l-strand transcription, as well as the displacement loop , but does not contain any canonical protein coding or rna coding genes  <cit> .

among the  <dig> completely sequenced vertebrate mitogenomes, a great majority shares an identical arrangement of  <dig> genes. however, alternative gene orders due to minor rearrangements and sequence duplications have been noted  <cit> , <cit> . a common feature of most rearrangements is dna duplications that involve trna genes and intergenic sequences. mitogenomes of several snake species contain two cr copies  <cit> , <cit> , and the four gene orders known in birds differ in cr copy number and cr location  <cit> - <cit> . related rearrangements have also been noted in bony fishes, and include both cr, oril and trna gene duplications  <cit> - <cit> .

a mitogenome intergenic spacer between the trnathr and trnapro genes , located close to the cr, has been reported in a few species representing distantly related vertebrate taxa. short t-p spacers have been found in ostrich birds  <cit> , in some toad linages including xenopus <cit> , <cit> , and in the mole lizard  <cit> . larger t-p spacers have been reported in various species of the salamander family ambystomatidae  <cit> , <cit> . these complex spacers vary in size from 240 bp to 680 bp and tandem repeat sequence motifs appear common, but no functional role has yet been assigned. a t-p spacer in a fish species was first discovered in the atlantic cod  mitogenome  <cit> - <cit> , and later noted in the related walleye pollock   <cit>  and six additional gadiform species representing three families   <cit> . these t-p spacers vary in size from 25 bp in fourbeard rockling  to 99 bp in haddock , and contain one or two copies of a conserved 17-bp motif   <cit> . t-p spacers demonstrate interspecific sequence variation and have been applied as genetic markers in population studies of both walleye pollock  <cit>  and atlantic cod  <cit> . more recently t-p spacers were reported in two additional gadid species  <cit> . while greenland cod  contains two size variants of the spacer , highly similar in sequence to that of atlantic cod, the arctic cod  t-p spacer appears more complex and variable in size due to short heteroplasmic tandem repeat motifs  <cit> .

the vertebrate mitochondrial transcriptome  has been investigated in human cells and tissues  <cit> , <cit> . the h and l strand polycistronic precursor transcripts are processed into the  <dig> trnas,  <dig> rrnas, and  <dig> mrnas  <cit> . here, the l-strand specific promoter  generates a transcript that gives rise to the nd <dig> mrna and  <dig> trnas. the h-strand specific transcription, however, is more complex since two promoters  are involved. whereas the hsp1-specific transcript is short and highly abundant, and is the main source of mitochondrial rrnas, the hsp2-specific transcript is processed into  <dig> monocistronic and two bicistronic mrnas  <cit> , <cit> . this organization appears highly conserved among vertebrates since atlantic cod and saithe  mito-transcriptomes are very similar to that of humans  <cit> .

long noncoding rnas , typically longer than 200 nt, are highly abundant in vertebrates where they possess key roles in gene regulation linked to tissue specificity, development and disease  <cit> , <cit> . the human mitogenome also code for lncrnas in addition to their  <dig> canonical genes. the first mitochondrial lncrna to be discovered was the 7s rna, transcribed from lsp within the cr  <cit> , <cit> . additional mitochondrial lncrnas have since then been identified in human cells, and include lncnd <dig>  lncnd <dig>  lnccytb  <cit> , as well as the prognostic lipcar lncrnas antisense to cytb and coii mrnas  <cit> . the lncnd <dig> rna is of particular interest due to its antisense organization to nd <dig> mrna, and the fact that nd <dig> is the only tightly regulated protein gene in vertebrate mitochondria  <cit> , <cit> . mitochondrial lncrnas appear highly conserved among vertebrates, and we recently reported noncoding rna corresponding to lncnd <dig> in the mito-transcriptomes of atlantic cod and saithe  <cit> .

here we report two non-overlapping mitochondrial lncrnas  transcribed from opposite strands within the atlantic cod cr, both terminating at the termination-associated sequence . while the 500 nt lnccr-l rna apparently corresponds to the human 7s rna  <cit> , the 375 nt lnccr-h rna has not been reported previously. the 5’ end of lnccr-h corresponds to the t-p spacer that apparently adds stability to the noncoding rna. the t-p spacer was found to be present in all  <dig> gadiform species investigated , and feature analysis indicates directional evolution of spacers from a simple organization in early branching gadiform families  to complex structures including heteroplasmy in merluciidae and gadidae.

RESULTS
complete mitogenome sequence of the european hake
the  <dig>  bp mitogenome of european hake  was determined and represents the first complete mitogenome sequence in the family merlucciidae . the circular mitogenome contains the same set of two ribosomal rna genes,  <dig> protein coding genes, and  <dig> transfer rna genes as reported in all codfishes to date , and is arranged according to the general vertebrate organization  <cit> . the 871 bp cr was found to be similar in size and related in sequence to that of the southern hake m. australis . we noted an unusual 42 bp insertion in the nd <dig> gene, corresponding to  <dig> amino acids, in european hake compared to that of other gadiforms . the insertion is located in a non-transmembrane region known to contain insertions in mammals  <cit> . finally, a large and complex intergenic t-p spacer  was found between the trnathr and trnapro genes .

the phylogenetic position of european hake among gadiformes was assessed from concatenated mitochondrial protein sequences  derived from complete mitogenome sequences , and a representative neighbor-joining tree is presented in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  eight gadiform families were included in the analysis and european hake  was found to occupy a more basal position compared to gadidae and lotidae, but apparenty more recent than macrouridae, bregmacerotidae and moridae. these observations are in general agreement with previous works on gadiform phylogeny  <cit> - <cit> .

t-p spacer in european hake contains heteroplasmic tandem repeats
the t-p spacer included in the complete european hake mitogenome sequence  was determined to 532 bp. this sequence consists of a 34 bp conserved direct repeat containing the 17-bp box-motif  <cit> , an optional direct repeat of about 60 bp, and  <dig> copies of an 8-bp heteroplasmic tandem repeat  . to investigate individual sequence variations, a t-p spacer region from another specimen  was analyzed by pcr amplification, plasmid cloning, and subsequent dna sequencing. the mm <dig> t-p spacer showed extensive length heteroplasmy, varying in size from 258 bp to 430 bp . size variation was partly caused by the 8-bp htr motif, which varied from  <dig> to  <dig> copies among six sequenced clones. furthermore, four clones contained an additional 76 bp sequence . all plasmid clones investigated gave identical sequences, except the htr copy number and two single nucleotide polymorphic sites .

distribution and variability of t-p spacers among gadiform species
to address the phylogenetic distribution of t-p spacers among gadiform species, we determined the dna sequences for the corresponding region in  <dig> additional species . we also retrieved available sequences from the ncbi database , adding up to a total of  <dig> species representing eight families . several interesting features were noted:  all of the gadiform species investigated harbor mitochondrial t-p spacers.  extensive size variation was observed among species, from 7 bp in anadara  to 532 bp in european hake.  a conserved 17 bp sequence  in  <dig> to  <dig> copies was present in  <dig> of  <dig> gadiform families.  heteroplasmic features were observed in three species, namely arctic cod  <cit> , european hake, and silvery pout , a codfish species belonging to the family gadidae. in a similar approach to that of the european hake, the silvery pout spacer was pcr amplified, cloned and sequenced. four independent clones revealed small length variations of homopolymeric stretches and one heteroplasmic snp site . the t-p spacer was found to be 261–263 bp in size, carrying three copies of the box-motif .

intraspecific variation of the atlantic cod t-p spacer
intraspecific variation of the t-p spacer was investigated in atlantic cod. the t-p spacer of atlantic cod is normally 74 bp in size and contains two copies of the box-motif . a total of  <dig> specimens were included in the analysis, representing all main localities in the north atlantic ocean  <cit> . among these,  <dig> sequences were published previously  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  and  <dig> new sequences were obtained by pcr amplifications and sequencing. we found variable sites at  <dig> of the  <dig> positions, which defined 26 t-p spacer haplotypes . the box-motif ii appeared more conserved than motif i, but no heteroplasmic sites were detected. the dominant haplotype  was represented by  <dig> % , including the whole genome sequenced neac_ <dig> specimen  <cit> . these findings are in general agreement with intraspecific variation previously reported in the t-p spacer of  <dig> individuals of walleye pollock  <cit> . three individuals representing two haplotypes  contained a 29 bp insert that includes the 17-bp box-motif copy . a similar duplication of box-motif i was observed in greenland cod  <cit> .

analysis of mito-transcriptome data from atlantic cod liver tissue
we reported previously the mapping of  <dig> pyrosequencing reads of mitochondrial transcripts from atlantic cod liver tissue  <cit> . here, all mitochondrial mrnas as well as the ribosomal rna transcript were represented by multiple reads each. we also observed a significant and stable l-strand specific lncrna  of about 500 nt covering parts of the cr, and apparently similar to that of the 7s rna in human mitochondria  <cit> . a closer inspection of the mito-transcriptome data identified a number of reads mapping to the opposite part of the cr including the t-p spacer , and corresponding to a h-strand specific lncrna. interestingly, this approximately 375 nt transcript  starts exactly 3 nt upstream of the trnathr gene and includes the t-p spacer, proceeds into the mirror trnapro and further into the htr domain of the cr, and terminates by a non-template polya tail immediately downstream of the tas. based on read map coverage, the relative abundance of lnccr-h was comparable to that of mitochondrial mrnas . lnccr-h varies in size due to different numbers of htrs included in the rna. we observed 1– <dig> htr copies in lnccr-h, with a majority of  <dig> copies . a secondary structure diagram of lnccr-h is presented in figure 3b, indicating structured domains at both the 5’ and 3’ ends. interestingly, the box and tas motifs are proposed to be part of tetraloop hairpin structures.

discussion
we report a complex intergenic spacer between the trnathr and trnapro genes in the european hake mitochondrial genome. the t-p spacer contains htrs, and significant size variation was observed among specimens. furthermore, we found t-p spacers to be present in mitogenomes of all the  <dig> gadiform species investigated, representing  <dig> families and  <dig> genera, and the majority of spacers harbor a conserved 17-bp box-motif. analysis of the atlantic cod liver mito-transcriptome identified a long noncoding rna  that contains the t-p spacer within its 5’ end.

mitogenomes of most bony fishes conform to the general vertebrate gene organization, and lack intergenic nucleotides between the trnathr and trnapro genes. in contrast, we found the presence of intergenic spacers at this location to be a consistent feature among gadiform species. based on key features and the distribution pattern of gadiform t-p spacers , as well as the current understanding of gadiform phylogeny  <cit> - <cit> , we propose the following evolutionary scenario for the gadiform t-p spacer . this scenario implies gain of function for this sequence element during gadiform evolution.  a spacer sequence was introduced at a basal point of gadiform phylogenesis.  once established, the box-motif became a preserved sequence feature of descendant taxa after the split from bathygadus, caelorinchus, coryphaenoides, ventrifossa, physiculus, laemonema, and bregmaceros. the majority of gadiform genera, representing  <dig> families, contain a single copy of the box-motif.  duplication of the box-motif then occurred within the family gadidae, leaving six genera  with two consecutive box-motifs.  the box-motif was also independently duplicated in silvery pout , and  within the family merluciidae, resulting in the complex european hake t-p spacer.  a second duplication occurred recently in gadus. here, a subset of atlantic cod and greenland cod specimens contains three copies of the box-motif due to a duplication of box-motif i. t-p spacer heteroplasmy was only noted in genera with duplicated box-motifs .

higher order phylogenetic relationships within gadiformes are still weakly supported by molecular data  <cit> - <cit> . other branching patterns than those depicted here would imply instances of secondary loss of the box-motif, which can of course not be precluded. however, the box-motif apparently represents a selective feature, of which the exact functional role is still unknown. it is interesting to note that complex t-p spacers in salamanders  <cit> , <cit>  contains strikingly similar box-motifs to those reported in codfishes , suggesting that an evolutionary conserved mitochondrial factor may interact with the motif.

analysis of the atlantic cod liver mito-transcriptome identified a relatively abundant lncrna  of about 375 nt, that contains the t-p spacer sequence within its 5’ end. the first nucleotide of lnccr-h corresponds to 3 nt downstream the trnathr gene, and the 5’ end of the lncrna was probably generated after rnase z processing of the trna precursor  <cit> . the 3’ end of lnccr-h appears heterogenous and polyadenylated, and corresponds to sequences in proximity to the tas box element within the cr. lnccr-h harbours secondary structure elements, including a mirror trnapro and tetraloop helices, probably adding stability to the rna. interestingly, recent rna-seq experiments in breast cell lines identified an expressed human homolog to lnccr-h , and hela cell rna profiles supported the existence of this mitochondrial lncrna . thus, lnccr-h appears conserved at a wide taxonomic range, which implies a functional role in vertebrate mitochondria.

mitochondrial lncrnas corresponding to antisense transcripts of mrnas have been characterized in human cells  <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  as well as in atlantic cod  <cit> . in that study we identified a second mitochondrial lncrna within cr, named lnccr-l. the l-strand specific lnccr-l, which corresponds to the human 7s rna  <cit> , <cit> , is apparently initiated at lsp and terminated at tas. our finding implicates that tas is a transcription termination site both for h-strand and l-strand specific lncrnas. tas in atlantic cod consists of a perfect inverted repeat motif  and thus forms identical tetraloop hairpin structures at the h- and l-strand transcripts. tas-binding proteins have been reported in human, rat and bovine mitochondria  <cit> , <cit> . how lnccr-h and lnccr-l are terminated and regulated in atlantic cod, as well as their biological functions, are currently unknown. however, we speculate that the biological role of the t-p spacer is to add stability to an evolutionary conserved lncrna where the box-motif forms an rna structure signal to be recognized by mitochondrial proteins. lnccr-h may have a role in antisense regulation by premature termination of l-strand transcription at tas, resulting in a coordination of h and l transcript levels. anyway, these possibilities need further investigations in different cell and tissue types, and in different species.

CONCLUSIONS
two long noncoding rna candidates from the mitochondrial control region were described in gadiform fishes. these rnas were transcribed from different dna strands, and found to terminate at the tas region in a tail-to-tail configuration. whereas the l-strand specific lncrna  corresponded to the previously described mitochondrial 7s rna, lnccr-h was found to be unique by containing a 5’ domain of an intergenic spacer. analyses of  <dig> gadiform species revealed that a t-p spacer was present in all investigated species, representing  <dig> families and  <dig> genera. some species contained complex spacer sequences due to conserved motifs, duplications, and heteroplasmy. we propose that the t-p spacer adds stability to lnccr-h by forming stable hairpin structures and additional protein binding sites, but a biological role of lnccr-h is currently unknown.
