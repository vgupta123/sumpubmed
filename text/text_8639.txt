BACKGROUND
the process of animal domestication is a striking example of convergent behavioral evolution. during domestication, populations diverge from their wild progenitors as a result of genetic drift, artificial selection on desirable traits, relaxed selection on previously important characteristics, and adaptation to new environmental and ecological conditions  <cit> . evolution in captivity is associated with a set of phenotypic changes, including enhanced growth rate  <cit> , attenuated responsiveness to stress  <cit> , increased feeding behavior  <cit> , and reduced predator avoidance behavior  <cit> . reductions in predator avoidance behavior are the most consistent responses to domestication and have been observed across a broad range of taxa, including mammals, birds, and fish  <cit> . however, it is not known whether the apparent convergent evolution of predator avoidance behavior during domestication is the result of similar genetic changes or of changes in a myriad of alternative molecular “routes” to the same phenotypic endpoint. in fact, little is known about the genetic polymorphisms associated with domestication in any vertebrate species.

differences in gene regulation are an important source of genetic variation for phenotypic evolution  <cit> . transcriptome analyses have detected substantial variation among populations in numerous species, including yeast  <cit> , drosophila <cit> , fish  <cit> , and humans  <cit> . much of this variation has a heritable component  <cit> . while the majority of variation in gene expression appears to evolve in a neutral fashion, some genes show patterns consistent with evolution under positive selection and may contribute to local adaptation  <cit> , including behavioral adaptations  <cit> . in particular, microarray studies suggest that domestication may also be associated with changes in gene expression  <cit> .

in the present study, we use the zebrafish  as a model for examining the relationship between behavioral domestication and variation in gene expression. the utility of the zebrafish in developmental biology and genomics is widely known, and there has been increased usage of the zebrafish as a model for behavior genetics  <cit> . variation in behavior has been observed among populations of zebrafish, including variation among domesticated  populations  <cit> , among populations recently acquired from the wild  <cit> , and between wild and domesticated populations  <cit> . in each of these studies, the populations were reared under identical conditions suggesting that the differences in behavior have a genetic component  <cit> .

in our study, we used microarrays to perform a transcriptome-wide analysis of variation in brain gene expression among four behaviorally distinct strains of zebrafish with different histories of domestication. first, we quantified behavioral differences between wild and domesticated zebrafish strains using a high throughput behavior assay  <cit> . second, using microarrays, we detected substantial variation in expression profiles among these behaviorally distinct populations, a portion of which was associated with domestication history. finally we compared our results against other microarray studies  <cit>  and identified sixteen homologous genes that were associated with behavioral domestication and variation in fear-related behavior across multiple species.

RESULTS
behavioral variation among zebrafish strains
we used a simple, high-throughput assay to characterize behavioral differences among zebrafish strains  <cit> . the assay was based on initial observations that fish from domesticated strains tended to spend more time near the surface and at the front of the aquarium nearest human technicians while wild fish tended to be found at the back and near the bottom of the aquarium. this assay decomposes this place preference type behavior into a vertical component  and a horizontal component . vertical depth quantifies the mean distance of an individual from the water surface while horizontal position is the proportion of the time an individual spends within one body length of the front of the tank, nearest to a human observer.

although simple in design, the behaviors quantified by this assay can be used as indices of fear-related behavior in fish species, and are likely indicators of trade-offs between foraging and predator avoidance. in the wild, proximity to the surface is believed to increase the risk of predation by aerial predators  <cit>  and observations of zebrafish and other fish species are consistent with this hypothesis  <cit> . however, in captivity, fish are commonly offered food that floats on the surface, providing a contradictory stimulus for approaching the surface. indeed, mean distance from the surface is negatively correlated with feeding behavior in zebrafish , masu salmon   <cit> , and growth hormone transgenic coho salmon   <cit> . also distance from the surface is positively correlated with freezing in response to a simulated predator by masu salmon  <cit> . recent work has also shown that zebrafish spend less time in the upper half of aquaria in response to stressful stimuli and treatment with anxiogenic chemicals , and more time following treatment with anxiolytic compounds   <cit> . therefore we conclude that these behaviors are valid indicators of fearfulness in various fish species.

we used these behavior assays to characterize four strains of zebrafish with different histories of domestication. the scientific hatcheries and transgenic mosaic  <dig>  strains have been reared in the laboratory for at least  <dig> generations and will be referred to as “domesticated.” the gaighata and nadia strains were recently acquired from wild populations in india and, at the time of this study, had been reared in captivity for  <dig> and  <dig> generations, respectively. for the sake of brevity, these strains will be referred to as “wild.” although all of the fish used in this experiment were bred and reared under identical captive conditions , there were significant behavioral differences between wild and domesticated zebrafish strains. the wild strains spent markedly less time within one body length of the front of the aquarium, nearest the observer , and showed a greater preference for the lower portions of the water column  than the domesticated strains .

the differences in behavior between wild and domesticated zebrafish populations were consistent with previous observations of these and other strains of zebrafish  <cit> . in particular, these four strains vary in their latency to feed from the surface of the water such that wild fish take much longer to commence feeding than domesticated fish  <cit> . likewise, similar differences have been observed between wild and domesticated populations of other fish species   <cit> . in general, domesticated fish tend to be bolder, feed more frequently, and have reduced ability to avoid predation  <cit> , characteristics that have been linked with decreased survival in a wild environment  <cit> .

transcriptome variation among zebrafish strains
we next tested if these behaviorally distinct zebrafish strains also differed in gene expression in the brain to identify genes or pathways that may underlie behavioral variation. genechip® zebrafish genome microarrays  were used to quantify the expression of approximately  <dig>  zebrafish transcripts in the brains of fish observed in the behavior study above.

a total of  <dig>  probe sets were detected as expressed in our zebrafish brain samples, based on our filtering criteria for expression . of these,  <dig>  probe sets displayed probe level variation indicative of sequence polymorphisms among individuals and populations, known as single feature polymorphisms   <cit> . the presence of sfps can confound comparisons of gene expression among different genotypes and therefore these features were removed from the analysis.

the remaining  <dig>  probe sets were analyzed using linear models for microarrays   <cit>  to test for differences in transcriptome profiles among strains, between wild and domesticated strains, and between males and females. our initial analysis revealed considerable variation in gene expression among the strains with  <dig>  probe sets differentially expressed among strains,  <dig> with a 2-fold or greater difference in pairwise comparisons of mean expression levels [see additional file  <dig>  this level of brain transcriptome variation among populations is substantially higher that than observed between two populations of rainbow trout  and among eight behaviorally diverse inbred mouse lines ; however these differences may reflect differences in statistical analyses or gene content of the array platforms.

the three probe sets with the highest differences among strains corresponded to quality control probe sets for green fluorescent protein  and cyan fluorescent protein . because the expression of gfp in the tm <dig> strain was the result of transgenic manipulation  <cit> , these genes were removed from the analysis. the next ten most differentially expressed zebrafish genes included cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily a ; major histocompatibility complex class ii dab gene ; g protein-coupled receptor  <dig> ; and seven unannotated sequences.

the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit>  was used to identify functional categories that were overrepresented in the final gene lists  relative to the  <dig>  genes detected as expressed in our analysis. david identified  <dig> functional categories that were significantly overrepresented among genes that varied in expression among strains [see additional file  <dig>  notable functional categories included those involved in dna repair, dna photolyase activity, response to light stimulus, neuron development and axon guidance, cell death, iron-binding, wd <dig> repeat domains, chromatin organization, and homeobox genes. functional interpretation of these findings is complicated because, although these genes differed among zebrafish populations, variation in expression was distributed in different patterns among the four zebrafish populations and did not necessarily involve correlated expression. these categories may represent functional groups of genes that, in the brain, may frequently vary among zebrafish populations. it is not known if this variation in gene expression is under selection or whether it is associated with variation in brain function or behavior.

transcriptome variation between wild and domesticated strains
a total of  <dig> probe sets were initially identified as differentially expressed between wild and domesticated strains. visual inspection of the data suggested that many of these differences were driven by extreme values in one of the strains. to increase the stringency of the analysis, genes associated with domestication were retained if the ranges of expression levels of wild and domesticated samples overlapped by no more than one sample. this additional criterion narrowed the list to  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed between wild and domesticated samples,  <dig> of which had a 2-fold difference or greater .

g protein-coupled receptor  <dig>  showed the largest difference with a  <dig> -fold down-regulation in domesticated zebrafish. gpr <dig>  also known as wntless or evenness interrupted , is necessary for the release of the wnt signaling peptide from wnt-secreting cells  <cit> . the wnt signaling pathway is a major control pathway for many aspects of embryonic development, including patterning of the central nervous system, and is also involved in axon guidance and synapse formation in adult organisms  <cit> . in addition, defects in wnt signaling are associated with neurological disorders in humans, including schizophrenia and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . selenoprotein p  was also among the most differentially expressed genes with a  <dig> -fold up-regulation in domesticated zebrafish, similar to previous observations of these strains  <cit> . the role of sepp in the brain is not completely understood but the protein plays a vital role in selenium homeostasis  <cit> . mouse sepp knockout mutants have reduced ability to store selenium in the brain and other tissues, and show severe neurological impairment  <cit> . in humans, selenium levels are associated with disease states including epilepsy, parkinson’s disease, and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . although it is unknown if sepp plays a role in these disorders, sequence variation in sepp affects the ability to utilize selenium in humans  <cit> .

david identified seven functional categories that were overrepresented among all genes differentially expressed between wild and domesticated zebrafish. after accounting for overlap, the functional groups can be reduced to two categories: vesicle proteins and acyl-coa binding domain containing proteins. each of these groups was represented by at most two or three individual genes. the vesicle proteins included synaptophysin b and synaptoporin which are associated with synaptic vesicles and synaptic plasticity  <cit> , and sec <dig> homolog, a subunit of the coat protein complex ii which enables the formation of transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum. knockout mice lacking synaptophysin are viable but show increased exploratory behavior and reduced learning ability and memory  <cit> , indicating that this gene can be directly involved in behavioral variation. stress is also known to influence both mrna and protein levels of synaptophysin in rats but the relationship is complex and influenced by factors including sex and the severity of the stressor  <cit> . reduced sensitivity to stress has been observed in domesticated fish  <cit>  and may be a factor in our study. the acyl-coa binding domain containing proteins included acbd <dig> and acbd <dig>  acbd <dig> maintains the structure of the golgi apparatus, influences protein transport between the golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, and is an important component of several cellular signaling pathways . the function of acbd <dig> has not been determined.

transcriptome variation between zebrafish sexes
although not a primary focus of this experiment, we also tested for sex differences in gene expression. we detected only eight sexually dimorphic genes in the brain: insulin-like growth factor  <dig> ; deiodinase, iodothyronine, type ii ; inhibin, beta aa ; endothelial pas domain protein  <dig> ; and four unannotated genes . of these only dio <dig> was previously documented as sexually dimorphic in zebrafish brains  <cit> . interestingly, although  <dig> of the  <dig> sexually dimorphic genes identified by santos et al. <cit> were represented on the genechip® zebrafish genome microarray, only eleven were detected as expressed in our study. this lack of concordance with our study is surprising, but could result from differences in experimental procedures, microarray platform and chemistry, and statistical analysis. a higher number of sexually dimorphic genes  were also detected in brain transcriptomes of immature atlantic salmon   <cit> . despite the differences between these studies and ours, all three studies showed substantially fewer sexually dimorphic genes in the brain relative to other tissues, such as liver  and gonads . this result is comparable to observations in mammals  <cit> .

validation using quantitative real-time pcr
we performed a technical validation using quantitative real-time pcr  to verify expression of six differentially expressed genes identified by the microarray analysis. the genes selected for qrt-pcr validation differed significantly among strains , between wild and domesticated strains , or between the sexes  in the microarray analysis. the qrt-pcr results were consistent with the microarray analysis for four of the six genes . qrt-pcr measures of gad <dig> expression did not agree with the microarray results, suggesting that there may be additional factors affecting hybridization to the microarray. expression of sepp1a also differed between microarray and qrt-pcr in that the gaighatta strain had higher levels than expected; however, we previously found agreement between our microarray findings  and qrt-pcr measures of sepp1a in an independent sample of these strains  <cit> . this unexpected disagreement may reflect strain-specific regulation of sepp1a expression by dietary selenium levels  <cit> .

comparison with other studies
examination of these findings in a comparative context can allow us to prioritize genes for future analyses. we therefore compared our results to other analyses in zebrafish and other species. several microarray studies have examined transcriptome variation associated with domestication or fear-related behavioral variation in other vertebrates. these studies include a comparison between wild and domesticated rainbow trout  <cit> , an analysis of the effect of selection for tame behavior in gray fox  <cit> , a comparison between dogs and wolves  <cit> , and an analysis of behavioral variation among inbred mouse lines  <cit> . cross-species comparisons of microarray studies are complicated by differences in microarray platforms and chemistry, hybridization efficiencies, experimental design, and statistical analyses. the studies also differed at the scale at which gene expression was measured in the brain. the canid and mouse studies measured expression separately in multiple regions of the brain  <cit>  while our study and the rainbow trout study  <cit>  examined gene expression in the entire brain. regional analyses of gene expression may be able to detect local changes in gene expression that are not detectable in whole brain analyses  <cit>  but brain regions must be selected with care to ensure that relevant regions are included in the analysis.

despite these complications, we identified sixteen evolutionarily or functionally related groups of genes that were associated with domestication in five vertebrate species, or fear-related behaviors in mice . the association of these genes with independently derived domesticated populations of evolutionarily divergent species suggests that these genes may be components of pathways influenced by convergent evolution during domestication, although they may not represent the causative polymorphisms. these genes are involved in a variety of functions including translation initiation, protein folding , amelioration of oxidative stress , and metabolic function . however, a few are known to affect functions in the brain.

studies included the present study on zebrafish , an analysis of domestication in rainbow trout   <cit> , silver fox  selected for tameness  <cit> , a comparison between dog  and wolf   <cit> , and an analysis of strain variation in laboratory mice   <cit> . positive signs  indicated up-regulation in domesticated populations relative to wild, while negative signs  indicate down-regulation. an asterisk  indicates that the direction of differential expression differed among brain regions.

a negative correlation with open field activity; b positive correlation with distance traveled after ethanol administration; c positive correlation with electroconvulsive threshold; d negative correlation with electroconvulsive threshold; e positive correlation with open field activity.

a few of these genes are associated with synapse function and long-term potentiation. syntaxins are components of the snare complex which mediates the docking of vesicles with extracellular membranes, including the release of neurotransmitters from axon terminals  <cit> , and appears to be regulated by several syntaxin-binding proteins  <cit> . protein levels of syntaxins increase during long-term potentiation in the rat hippocampus  <cit> . in studies related to domestication, mrna expression of syntaxin1b <dig> was higher in foxes selected for tameness  <cit> ; expression of syntaxin-binding proteins was higher in domesticated rainbow trout  <cit>  and correlated with fear-related behaviors in mice  <cit> . in contrast, in our study of zebrafish, expression of three syntaxin genes differed among strains but was not associated with domestication history. likewise, caspases, such as capase- <dig>  are associated with synaptic plasticity and learning, in addition to their involvement in apoptosis  <cit> . caspase-3a and capase- <dig> were up-regulated in domesticated populations of zebrafish  and rainbow trout  <cit> . these observations suggest that synapse development and function may be influenced by domestication.

the association of collagens and hemoglobins with domestication of multiple species was surprising. collagens are rare in the brain and are usually associated with the meninges surrounding the brain  <cit> . this includes several of the collagen genes differentially expressed among zebrafish populations , between wild and domesticated rainbow trout  <cit> , and correlated with behavior in mice  <cit> . it is possible that the meninges may have contaminated the brain samples, although it is not clear why this contamination would differ in level between populations in multiple species. alternatively a few collagen genes are expressed in the brain and appear to be involved in neurological development, including axon guidance and synaptogenesis in the cns  <cit> .

expression of hemoglobin genes was positively associated with domestication in rainbow trout  <cit> , negatively associated with tameness in foxes  <cit> , and positively associated with open field activity in mice  <cit> . hemoglobin genes were also differentially expressed among zebrafish populations. it was recently discovered that hemoglobin genes are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes of rats and humans, and may be involved in oxygen storage and mitochondrial function in the brain  <cit> .

finally, snp variation has been detected among zebrafish populations and may be associated with the variation in behavior and gene expression we observed here. whiteley et al. <cit>  examined snp variation among thirteen wild populations and three laboratory strains of zebrafish and detected  <dig> significantly divergent outlier snp loci that may be signatures of natural selection. eight of these outlier loci occurred in genes that were also differentially expressed in our analysis among populations  and between wild and domesticated populations , suggesting that variation in the expression of these genes may also be under selection. their study populations included the laboratory tm <dig> strain and wild populations in geographic regions from which our wild strains were originally collected.

CONCLUSIONS
using a high throughput behavior assay, we detected significant variation among zebrafish strains in behaviors related to fearfulness and predator avoidance. this variation showed a strong association with domestication history, consistent with patterns observed in other fish species. while there was substantial inter-strain variation in patterns of gene expression in the brain, far fewer genes were associated with domestication history. this suggests two hypotheses regarding the evolution of behavior during domestication. first, convergent behavioral evolution during domestication may result through independent alterations in different pathways that achieve similar phenotypic effects. if this is the case, each of our domesticated zebrafish populations would have different genes associated with behavioral variation, and these genes would be lost among the large number of genes varying among populations and therefore undetectable in our comparison. alternatively, evolution of these behavioral phenotypes may involve only a few genes or pathways to achieve the behavioral variations observed here. in our study, the number of genes associated with domestication in zebrafish is comparable to that associated with within-population behavioral variation in other fish species, such as differences between dominant and subordinate cichlids  and between sneaker and migratory males in atlantic salmon . this suggests that behavioral variation can be associated with alterations in the expression of relatively few genes in the brain. in addition, identification of genes associated with domestication in multiple vertebrate species may indicate convergent evolution of a few key molecular pathways during domestication. full evaluation of these hypotheses is beyond the scope of our study and would require more comprehensive analyses using both multiple populations and multiple species. however transcriptome variation among populations can be substantial and should be given careful consideration when designing genomic analyses of behavior and other traits.
