BACKGROUND
duckweed is an aquatic plant seen on water surfaces in many locations in the world. because it consists mainly of a leaf-like body that performs photosynthesis, it is probably the most efficient multicellular biological solar energy converter that we have. its structure during this stage of the life cycle is referred to as fronds. greater duckweed or spirodela polyrhiza is extremely simple with only one frond  and some roots into a compact structure. fronds grow vegetatively and can increase biomass rapidly, lowering carbon dioxide in the air and reducing nitrogen and phosphor in the water  <cit> . many species of duckweeds can double their biomass every  <dig> or  <dig> days  <cit> . in addition, the tiny and free-floating duckweeds need very little amount of lignin to support their growth  <cit> . on the contrary, they might save the extra energy to synthesize more protein and carbohydrate. spirodela polyrhiza has low amount of lignin  <cit> , which contains  <dig> % of protein  <cit>  and up to 70% carbohydrate in dry weight  <cit> . the relatively easy harvesting process compared to algae is to skim of the floating fronds by net or collect them at the outlet of water by a grid  <cit> .

there are conditions like temperature shifts due to seasons that can cause a morphological change to a different structure, called turions. many species of the subfamily lemnoideae can produce this kind of dormant fronds, which are characterized by more starch, smaller vacuoles and air space  <cit> . this developmental change is also accompanied by a shift in metabolism. the energy harvested during photosynthesis is shifted to starch biosynthesis, resulting in the accumulation of starch in turions. because the volume of intercellular air space shrinks and starch increases the density of the tissue, it can sink to the bottom of waters where the organism can survive even if the top of the water freezes. turions can change back to fronds vegetatively using the starch as an energy source, demonstrating a highly evolved adaptation to the environment. because fronds have little lignin, which would interfer with the digestion of the carbohydrate fraction of biomass, and turions have high starch content, duckweed might also be suitable as an alternative source of bioenergy. whereas cellulose is a crystalline, compact and structural compound resistant to biological attack and enzymatic degradation, starch is readily digested. even though many advances over the past years have been made in the commercialization of cellulosic biomass  <cit> , the cost of producing equal amounts of ethanol from cellulosic biomass is still much higher than production directly from starch  <cit> . therefore, growing attention is being devoted to use duckweeds as a source of carbon compounds and convert duckweed biomass into bio-ethanol  <cit> . fronds growing in swine wastewater contain  <dig> %  of starch. moreover,  <dig> % of the original dry biomass can be enzymatically hydrolyzed into a reducing sugar, which contributes to  <dig> % fermented ethanol of dry biomass  <cit> .

recent studies have focused on the influence of various environmental conditions for turion formation or germination  <cit> , the sensitivity threshold of aba for turion formation  <cit>  and the different structure  of fronds and turions  <cit> . on the other hand, information of starch content, granule size, and derivation of starch granules involvement with turion formation, which is critical to explore the potential biofuel of duckweed, is less well understood.

the pathway of starch synthesis is very complex, but adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  plays a pivotal role in regulating starch levels and in determining patterns of starch deposition in plants. this enzyme comprises two identical large subunits  and two same small subunits  in angiosperms, each of which is encoded by distinct genes. even though the roles of each agpase subunit in the enzyme are not clear, it is generally proposed that apls modify the response to allosteric regulators, whereas apss act as the catalytic part  <cit> . recent studies suggest that agpase are usually in plastidial forms except for a cytosolic one in cereal endosperms  <cit> . here, we compared the distinctive attributes between fronds and turions in s. polyrhiza and investigated starch production during development upon induction with abscisic acid , a plant hormone. to gain further insight into the function of the large subunit of agpase  in starch synthesis as well, we cloned the spirodela genes, analyzed them, and quantified their expression, which will allow in the future targeting expression of transgenes.

RESULTS
turion induction with aba
spirodela polyrhiza was grown under controlled light conditions as described under methods. fronds were harvested and examined under a dissecting microscope. dividing fronds, representing single leaf-like bodies, were connected, thin, and elliptical . the top of fronds was bright green, whereas the bottom extended a few roots that were submerged into water . continued growth in the presence of aba gave rise to turion formation with different morphological features . after  <dig> days of aba application a significant shift to starch accumulation took place in samples collected from both wet and dry tissues. starch accumulation during turion development exhibited a characteristic pattern. there was a progressive increase of starch from  <dig> days to  <dig> days after aba application and after  <dig> days, the starch content became almost stable. the final starch content in turions for wet tissues was  <dig> %, which corresponds to  <dig> % in dry mass . turions were also harvested and examined under a dissecting microscope. they appeared thicker and smaller in nearly round shape . turions were dark green, spotted with many anthocyanin pigments, and retained only rudimentary roots that are not visible by naked eye .

frond samples were then examined by electron microcopy. the frond cell had normal discal chloroplasts with a few small starch grains . most frond cells contained a single larger vacuole and bigger intercellular air space, while turion cells have multiple smaller vacuoles and bigger air space between cells . the turion cell accumulated many starch granules, which almost occupied 1/4-2/ <dig> of cell volume . the kidney-shaped starch granule was surrounded with stacks of thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts . the increased starch granules at the expense of the vacuolar expansion also contributed to the distortion of chloroplasts  and a shift in tissue density that caused turions to sink to the bottom of liquid medium . placed on filter paper, they looked like "green seeds" compared to fronds .

cloning and sequencing of members of the spirodela apl gene family
the level of starch accumulation in turions  and the convenience of collecting them from the flask bottom  are key features for biofuel applications as described above. to examine the metabolic regulation of these features, this study seeks to identify key enzymes, whose manipulation at the molecular level could optimize the timing and level of starch production. common knowledge would then suggest investigating the differential expression of key enzymes in starch biosynthesis. therefore, we decided to clone the large subunit of the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene family  from spirodela polyrhiza. because this gene is very conserved among angiosperms, we used the known arabidopsis protein sequences to design degenerate primers to amplify apl coding sequences as described under methods. cloned dna fragments were then sequenced and overlapping fragments were used to reconstruct the entire three cdna-copies from spirodela. we named them spapl <dig>  spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> with genbank accession numbers of jn <dig>  jn <dig>  jn <dig>  based on the cdna sequences primers were then designed to clone the corresponding gene sequences from total genomic dna as described under methods. the cloned genes of spapl <dig>  spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> were then also sequenced and deposited into genbank with accessions jn <dig>  jn <dig>  jn <dig>  respectively. after aligning cdnas with their corresponding genomic sequences, all introns could be identified. accordingly, all spapls consisted of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . whereas the coding sequences of the spapl <dig>  spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> genes were slightly different in length with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  bp or  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, the corresponding genomic regions differed significantly with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp , reflecting intron expansions.

structure and phylogeny of members of the spirodela apl gene family
the basis for the variation in protein sizes became clear when their primary structures were compared with other known apls. sequence alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of spapl <dig>  spapl <dig>  and spapl <dig> proteins showed high homology except for their n-terminal regions . apls are usually targeted to the plastid through a signal peptide at their amino-terminus. spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> had conserved plastid-targeting signals with cleavage sites at positions  <dig> and  <dig> based on targetp http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/targetp/. the shorter protein of spapl <dig> had a very weak targeting signal and internal deletions similar to the rice apls. although there were differences in the amino-terminal regions, the coding sequences from exon  <dig> to  <dig> were of the same size and very conserved.

the corresponding introns, however, have diverged significantly in length and composition. interestingly, comparison to the tigr plant repeat database  <cit>  indicated that expansion of introns could be largely due to miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements . when the must system was applied that was used to predict mites rather than depending on sequence homology alone, the sequence data suggested then that mites had invaded the introns of spapl <dig>  spapl <dig>  and spapl <dig>  comprising now 36%, 21%, and 7% of total intron sequences, respectively .

using the amino acid sequence alignment of apls from s. polyrhiza, rice, and maize, we constructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny of the apl family. this phylogenetic tree separated the apls into three main clades: spapl <dig> clustered together with the plastidial forms of osapl <dig> and zmapl <dig> in branch apl-i. spapl <dig> shares the branch apl-ii with the plastidial forms of osapl <dig> and zmapl4; spapl <dig> shares a common ancestor with both plastidial  and cytosolic forms  in rice and maize  <cit>  .

a structural model of the apls
to confirm the inference of their function, three-dimensional structures of spapls were built by using the experimental protein structure  from potato as a suitable template. amino acid sequence alignment of the regulatory site of apls from potato and s. polyrhiza showed five key conserved residues   in all three spapls. molecular modeling analysis of apls suggested a critical role of apls for allosteric regulation in this region with binding sites for atp and 3-pga . p <dig> was important for accommodating atp phosphate groups, as it was located between a conserved ggxgxrl loop region and the strongly conserved "pav" region, which involved catalysis and allosteric regulation  <cit> . p <dig> was predicted to be located in flexible loops close to the lysine residues , while p <dig> lied in a helix. site-directed mutagenesis of the p <dig> and p <dig> in potato showed dramatic changes in affecting enzyme regulatory properties, while p <dig> mutants resulted in a nearly catalytically inactive enzyme  <cit> . k <dig> and k <dig> were shown to be involved in the increase of the affinity for the activator 3-pga  <cit> . model structures of apl <dig>  apl <dig> and apl <dig> were identical in these features. therefore, only apl <dig> was shown in figure  <dig> as an example.

expression patterns of apl genes in developing turions
with three different gene copies present in spirodela polyrhiza, the question arises how each enzyme is expressed temporally during turion formation. we therefore isolated total mrna from leaf-like tissue  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after the addition of aba. to measure expression of each apl gene copy, we applied qpcr to mrna samples using specific primer pairs to distinguish between transcripts from each gene. expression of spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> dramatically increased two-and 10-fold, respectively, as turion development was initiated . furthermore, there seemed to be a difference in the expression of spapl <dig> and spapl <dig>  spapl <dig> was critically in the first phase of induction, whereas spapl <dig> seemed to replace spapl <dig> in a second burst of activity. there was no obvious increased expression of spapl <dig> after aba induction. indeed, spapl <dig> appeared to be more active in initial fronds compared to spapl <dig> . when turions went into mature phase , the expression of all spapls was leveling off .

discussion
we began dissecting the process of turion formation in duckweeds. usually turion development occurs in late summer or early autumn because of starvation and lower temperatures  <cit> . spirodela turions can also be induced under controlled laboratory conditions by increasing the concentration of aba in the growth medium  <cit> , decreasing temperature  <cit> , or depriving phosphorus in the medium  <cit> . here, we have taken advantage of aba as an inducer and could reproduce the morphological changes that occur during turion formation. turions are germinated into new fronds in the presence of light and nitrogen in the following spring using starch storage as an energy source  <cit> . therefore, the drastic starch accumulation during turion formation marks a turning point in the switch process from low-starch fronds to high-starch turions.

the reported contents of starch varied from 14% to 43% depending on the species, developmental states   <cit>  and tested methods  <cit> . starch content could even go up to 75% of the dry weight in resting fronds of spirodela oligorrhiza  growing in phosphor-deficient cultures  <cit> , a level that is comparable to cereal seeds of corn, sorghum and wheat  <cit> . even though regular fronds have as low as 16% starch in dry mass, turions of s. polyrhiza can reach up to 62% starch  <cit> . our use of exogenous aba produces the same developmental switch, as the different morphological features are easily distinguishable. the switch is rapid, providing advantages for biochemical and physiological analysis  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> % starch from dry mass after  <dig> weeks of aba induction , which is comparable to the henssen's study. the size of mature starch grains from turions was around  <dig> μm in diameter as estimated by tem , whereas starch grains from wheat, corn and rice reach a size of  <dig> μm,  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm, respectively  <cit> . in a different study, the size of starch granules illuminated by red light for different times have also been measured using sem scans arriving at similar values  <cit> . interestingly, it has been suggested that smaller starch granules are more easily hydrolyzed into sugars than larger ones, regardless of botanical source  <cit> . after  <dig> h of continuous irradiation, the sizes of starch granules in turions are significantly reduced to about  <dig>  μm  <cit> . although duckweeds might have adapted to rapidly switch back to a growth phase faster than seed plants, this property also might provide a more efficient way for producing bio-ethanol than from maize.

amyloplasts in non-photosynthetic tissue, such as seeds, roots, and stems, which lack chlorophyll and internal membranes, are the main organelles responsible for the synthesis and storage of starch granules in most plants. however, turions remain green or dark-green throughout their development . the plastids in turions, where starch synthesis takes place, still retain abundant stacks of thylakoids . it therefore suggests that chloroplasts with a simple structure as in duckweeds can function both as source and sink. the starch-storing plastids of turions are directly derived from chloroplasts, and retain chloroplast-like characteristics throughout their development. this adaptation greatly saves energy by directly depositing sucrose generated from photosynthesis into starch storage without the need for transport through a vascular system and the use of a glucose phosphate transporter  <cit> . a similar system exists also in a non-aquatic plants such as pea embryos, where starch-storing plastids also directly originate from chloroplast  <cit> . moreover, using tem light-induced degradation of starch granules in turions of spirodela polyrhiza also exhibited a transition from amyloplasts to chloroplasts  <cit> . both studies would demonstrate that differentiation from chloroplast to amyloplast could be reversed based on physiological changes. indeed, the cell structure of turions appears to be well organized for its function. its lack of intercellular air space and presence of smaller vacuoles allow them to survive in deep water, where the temperature is more moderate than on the surface. the numerous starch grains provide a bank of energy when turions germinate in the following spring. this life cycle is also consistent with starch content in fronds and turions.

because starch biosynthesis is an important feature for the developmental switch from fronds to turions, it also provides us with the first entry point to dissect the developmental regulation of turion formation. therefore, we reasoned that the first step in this line of investigation consists of the identification and characterization of key regulatory genes known in starch biosynthesis, which are the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylases. we successfully cloned three copies of apls of spirodela polyrhiza. apls are expressed in different organs of grass species, type  <dig> in leaves, type  <dig> and type  <dig> in seeds, and type  <dig> in both seeds and leaves  <cit> . based on phylogeny and spatial expression of spapls , they have their homologs in grass species. spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> are active in turions, while spapl <dig> is expressed at a higher level in fronds. the transcript level of spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> are active at an early phase of turion formation, while all transcript level of spapls decline towards the end phase. it could account for the inhibition of total rna synthesis after  <dig> days in aba, which leads to the shutdown of all primary processes and onset of the dormant state  <cit> . analysis of networks of gene expression during arabidopsis seed filling has also shown that expression of carbohydrates occurred early in seed development  <cit> . noticeably, the transcription of spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> is suppressed right after one day of aba addition, which is quite consistent with previous findings that aba could inhibit dna, protein, and rna synthesis during turion development  <cit> . but this inhibitory effect of aba during turion development is selective for that the synthesis of certain turion specific proteins increases  <cit> . indeed, the pattern of expression was consistent with a rate-limiting role for this protein in starch biosynthesis. furthermore, the regulation of gene copies underwent divergence and probably sub-functionalization to permit metabolic differentiation.

in plants, adp-glucose pyrophosphorylases consist of large and small subunits that share many amino acids due to the proposed origination from a common ancestral gene  <cit> . for example, apls and apss, which make up the heterotetrametic potato enzyme, share significant sequence homology   <cit> . here we selected the large subunit for our analysis because we made the assumption that both are coordinately expressed and that the large subunit should suffice as a marker of the developmental switch between frond and turion stage of the life cycle. furthermore, the current sequencing of the entire genome will provide an opportunity to locate the gene copies of the small subunit as well. the model structure of the large subunit confirms that n-and c-terminal regions of the spapls are essential for the allosteric regulatory properties of the heterotetrameric enzyme agpase   <cit> . even though apls are considered as a catalytic-disabled subunit, the ability of binding effectors  and substrates  is likely to undergo a conformational transition similar to the apss during its catalytic cycle  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis showed that spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> descended from common ancestors of the plastidial form type  <dig> and type  <dig> of the grasses, respectively, while spapl <dig> shares the same branch with the ancestor of cytosolic type  <dig> and plastidial type  <dig> of grasses   <cit> . studies suggest that cytosolic type  <dig> in grass evolved from a duplication of an ancestral gene encoding a type  <dig> plastidial apl by loss-of-function of the transit peptide cleavage site  <cit> . a similar process might have taken place in spirodela, where spapl <dig> does not exhibit a clear transit peptide. interestingly, the opposite seems to be true for spapl <dig>  which clusters with cytosolic type  <dig> apls, but encodes a transit peptide. based on this, we classify it as a plastidial type  <dig> apl of the grasses. the phylogenetic relationship will become clearer when we know whether these copies are clustered or dispersed in the spirodela genome. interestingly, there is differential invasion of mites in the introns of these genes with the most pronounced invasion in the spapl <dig> gene . this is reminiscent of the grasses, where one of the smallest genomes, rice, had a relative high percentage of mites , but low retrotransposon content . spirodela polyrhiza was namely chosen for sequencing because of its small genome size. given the genome size variation among lemnoideae, perhaps a similar relationship of genome size and mites exists among lemnoideae as has been found in grass species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, turions of s. polyrhiza contain high starch content, small size of starch granules, and low lignin proportion, which provides a solid foundation for developing them as an alternative biofuel source. for further investigation of the role of spapl <dig> and spapl <dig> genes in starch synthesis, studies using transgenic plants will be needed.
