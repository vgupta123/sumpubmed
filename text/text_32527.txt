BACKGROUND
understanding immune responses in corals represents a convergence of two very different research agendas. firstly, as early diverging animals, corals and their relatives provide novel perspectives on the evolution of immune systems. secondly, on a more practical level, the hope is that understanding immune responses may provide insights into, and ways of managing, the coral diseases that are devastating many reefs.

coral diseases are contributors to the global decline of reefs, and there is a perception that these often act synergistically with other stressors in bringing about coral mortality . for some coral diseases, bacteria have been implicated as causative agents  <cit> , whilst black band disease is thought to reflect necrosis of the coral tissue underlying a microbial mat  <cit> . surprisingly little is known about immune mechanisms in corals or other cnidarians, but it is clear that anthozoans have homologs of much of the innate immune repertoire of mammals, including toll/tlr and complement pathway components  <cit>  and nods/nlrs  <cit> . one of the most intriguing findings to emerge from comparisons between the coral acropora and the sea anemone nematostella, the two anthozoan cnidarians for which whole genome sequence data are available, is the relative complexity of the predicted immune repertoire of the coral  <cit> . many domains associated with immune functions in higher animals  are over-represented in the coral by comparison with the sea anemone. for example, where nematostella has a single canonical toll-like receptor  <cit> , acropora has at least four  <cit> , and the nacht domain complexity of acropora is at least an order of magnitude greater than those of nematostella or man  <cit>  and includes novel domain combinations  <cit> .

although there is a large literature on coral disease, studies to date have been largely descriptive. symptoms have been described and associated microorganisms sequenced, but in only one case has a bacterium isolated from a coral been unequivocally established as a causative agent by reinfecting a coral and reproducing the symptoms  <cit> . progress has been inhibited by the difficulty of culturing many coral-inhabiting bacteria, but the field is now rapidly moving forward . similarly, reports on the innate immune responses of corals to damage or infection have proliferated in recent years . as the latter have pointed out, the innate immune response involves three steps:  recognition,  transmission of this recognition via signaling pathways to effectors, and  an effector response. there has been progress in studying each of these steps. candidate pattern recognition receptors have been identified by homology searching of genome and transcriptome data for toll-like receptors, integrins and lectins and, in the case of the a. millepora lectin gene millectin, upregulation has been demonstrated in response to immune challenge  <cit> . the identification of complement c <dig> homologs in acropora millepora and porites lobata, has been interpreted as “indicative of lectin-mediated cellular immune functions”  <cit> .

phenoloxidase  activities have been demonstrated in many corals, and roles for these have been proposed in generating bactericidal radicals as well as in melanin synthesis  <cit> . melanin resulting from po-catalysed polymerization of phenolic compounds can encapsulate pathogens and/or wall off damaged cells, and its synthesis in response to injury or infection has been demonstrated in a number of corals  to be identified from a coral. although no other amps produced by corals have been identified to date, there is mounting evidence that some of the microbes normally found in the mucus of healthy corals may produce peptides that hold other, harmful, bacteria in check .

for the staghorn coral acropora millepora, a “near complete” transcriptome assembly is available  <cit> , permitting comprehensive and relatively unbiased analyses of coral immune responses. to better understand how corals respond to immune challenge, we exposed single colonies of a. millepora to muramyl dipeptide  and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid , two defined immunogens provoking distinct but well characterised responses in higher animals, and then determined the acute response at the whole transcriptome level using high throughput sequencing . mdp is a minimal common peptidoglycan constituent of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria, whereas poly i:c is essentially a viral mimic due to its structural similarity to double stranded rna. in mammals, the immune responses to these compounds are fairly well understood, providing a reference against which the molecular responses of coral can be compared. in the mouse, mdp-like compounds released as a result of phagolysosomal processing of bacteria are thought to be ligands of the nacht-domain protein nod <dig>  <cit> , activating nf-kb signaling  <cit>  and leading to expression of amps and cytokines  <cit> . poly i:c is a ligand for the murine tlr <dig> receptor, activating map-kinases and nf-kb by distinct molecular pathways  <cit> . in drosophila, nf-kb dependent expression of amps is triggered by infection by diverse infective agents through the toll receptor , but nod-like proteins are not present. drosophila toll- <dig> has recently been shown to be a pattern recognition receptor for a viral ligand, inducing antiviral autophagy independently of both nf-kb and jak-stat pathways  <cit> .

comparative analyses of mdp and poly i:c challenged corals reveals similarities with the responses both of arthropods and mammals, as well as coral-specific effects. three genes belonging to the gimap/ian family, associated with immunity in mammals, were amongst the genes most highly up-regulated upon mdp challenge. this ancient gene family has a patchy distribution across the animal kingdom that is characterised by many independent losses and lineage-specific expansions. although convergence cannot be ruled out, gimap expression during immune challenge in coral may reflect an ancient function, perhaps in phagolysosomal processing.

RESULTS
the molecular responses to challenge with mdp or poly i:c are largely discrete
for each treatment, relatively few genes were identified as differentially regulated using an adjusted p-value cut-off of 5% . one reason for this is the large variation in responses of individual corals that has previously been observed in a. millepora <cit> . the sets of genes differentially regulated by mdp and poly i:c are largely discrete: only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to both treatments , with few known genes responding to challenge with mdp and poly i:c in the same way. amongst these, cluster <dig>  which encodes the core histone h <dig>  <cit> , was strongly up-regulated relative to controls. cluster <dig>  which encodes an hsp12/orp150-related chaperone, was the most strongly up-regulated gene under both treatments. the hsp12/orp <dig> proteins are a group of atypical members of the hsp <dig> family  <cit>  that are widely distributed across the metazoa , and known to play a protective role in vertebrate hypoxia and immune responses  <cit> .

a general suppression of calcification under immune challenge is implied by the down-regulation of galaxin-like  <dig>  and cluster <dig>  which encodes a voltage gated calcium channel-like vwa protein. likewise, the down-regulation of cluster <dig>  which encodes a multi-domain fatty acid synthase protein, and lipases  suggests a general suppression of metabolism under immune challenge, as is also seen under acute acidification  <cit> .

a gene ontology enrichment analysis of the response to each immunogen indicates that in both treatments a single category  is significantly overrepresented. this is consistent with the differential expression of histones and zinc finger proteins outlined below.

specific responses to challenge with poly i:c
the poly i:c response is predominantly negative, only  <dig> genes being specifically up-regulated compared to  <dig> specifically down-regulated . the up-regulated genes include a number of collagens, nadp-type glutamate synthase , a putative tnf-receptor protein  distinct from that mentioned above , an nfx-type zinc finger protein , and a lipophorin . genes with a wide range of predicted functions are down-regulated, but amongst these are a number encoding rna-binding or processing activities; for example, an argonaute protein  and an rna-helicase .

specific responses to challenge with mdp
by contrast with the effect of poly i:c treatment, the acute transcriptional response to mdp was predominantly positive:  <dig> genes were specifically up-regulated and  <dig> specifically down-regulated in this treatment . the known acropora genes histone h2b  <cit>  and the pa79- <dig> choloylglycine hydrolase  <cit>  were up-regulated specifically by mdp, as was an unambiguous ortholog of the histone  <dig> variant h <dig>  . after mdp challenge, the most highly up-regulated gene  encodes a serine protease similar to kallikrein. a number of proteins containing immune-related domains were amongst those up-regulated; cluster <dig> encodes an o-linked-mannose beta- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, cluster <dig> encodes two igc2-type domains and cluster026172m encodes a cytochrome p- <dig> family member. decreases in the expression levels of other immune-related proteins , including the known tir <dig> protein ;  <cit>  were also observed. note that this tir protein has a predicted extracellular domain but lacks the lrrs that characterise canonical tlr proteins.

coral members of the gimap/ian family are up-regulated by the bacterial pamp mdp but not by poly i:c
three of the ten genes that were most highly up-regulated after mdp challenge are distinct homologs of the gtpases of immunity associated proteins , which are also known as immune-associated nucleotide-binding proteins . each of these three genes was up-regulated >50-fold by mdp, but transcript levels were not significantly affected following poly i:c treatment. up-regulation of gimap-related proteins in coral after challenge with a bacterial cell wall derivative is intriguing, because these proteins have been implicated in the immune responses to bacteria of both vertebrates  and higher plants . the gimap/ians are a distinct group within the p-loop ntpase superfamily , defined by the presence of the aig <dig> gtp-binding domain . for each of the three a. millepora gimap-like predicted proteins, the ntpase domain matches best the aig <dig> model pfam <dig>  =  <dig> e-14; cluster  <dig>  =  <dig> e-19; cluster <dig>  =  <dig> e-13), whereas the significance values for matches to other related domains  were much lower . the coral gimaps  are small proteins and appear to lack the c-terminal extensions that are typical of their vertebrate counterparts, and which often contain coiled-coil and/or hydrophobic domains. although the catalytic residues and other defining features  were present in each of the coral gimaps, we were unable to identify regions with sequence similarity to the conserved box  defined in mammals.

structure and organisation of the coral gimap loci
the three acropora gimap-like genes map to a single scaffold and are tightly linked in the coral genome; figure  <dig> summarises the organisation of the coral gimap loci. in acropora digitifera, clear orthologs  of the three a. millepora gimap loci constitute a 5 kb cluster; only a few hundred bases separate the coding sequences, each of which is intronless. it is highly likely that the organisation of the gimap loci is the same in the case of acropora millepora; all of the a. millepora gimap transcripts map to a region of similar size to the a. digitifera locus, but this region of the genome is not sufficiently well assembled to unequivocally confirm the organisation shown. clearly orthologous genes flank the gimap loci in the two acropora species . the clustered organisation of the gimap loci in coral parallels the situation in mammals and plants. the human and mouse genomes each contain eight clustered gimap loci whereas arabidopsis has  <dig> ian loci. these are organised into nine gene and three gene clusters on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and a single gene on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the clustered organisation of these genes in each organism suggests relatively recent lineage-specific duplications, and phylogenetic analyses are consistent with this hypothesis, sequences clustering primarily with others from the same or closely related species.

in addition to the three genes identified in the immune stimulation experiments, searching the a. millepora transcriptome yielded four other sequences encoding proteins containing both an aig1-like domain and a c-terminal hint domain . the pfam <dig> hint domain is based on an alignment of intein domains of hedgehog proteins, implying that these coral aig <dig> proteins undergo protein splicing.

aig <dig> domains are patchily distributed across the eukaryotes
as outlined above, to date gimap/ian proteins have been described only in vertebrates and higher plants  <cit> . on the basis of the identification of clearly related proteins in the coral, a broad phylogenomic survey of the gene family was undertaken, the results of which are summarised as figures  <dig> and  <dig>  surprisingly, orthologs of the clustered acropora gimap genes could not be identified in either nematostella or hydra, the two other cnidarians for which whole genome sequences are available. two weak matches to the ian- <dig> domain were, however, identified in hydra . the broader distribution of gimap/aig <dig> loci across the eukaryotes is extremely patchy . the aig <dig> domain was not detected in representative fungi, protists or choanoflagellates, or in the early diverging metazoans amphimedon and trichoplax. not only do drosophila and caenorhabditis lack aig <dig> loci, but this holds also for all of the other available ecdysozoan genomes. amongst lophotrochozoans, aig <dig> loci were only detected in lottia gigantica, where  <dig> paralogs were found. ciona and strongylocentrotus - representatives of the deuterostome lineages urochordata and echinodermata, respectively – also lacked aig <dig> loci, although all vertebrates and both the cephalochordate brachiostoma and the hemichordate saccoglossus encoded multiple aig <dig> domains. the aig <dig> complement of danio rerio was particularly complex, the genome containing over  <dig> loci.

to better understand evolutionary relationships of aig <dig> sequences, maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  methods of phylogenetic analysis were applied . representative plant toc <dig> sequences were included in these analyses for comparative purposes. several of the ambiguous aig1-like sequences from animals clustered with the plant toc <dig> sequences in phylogenetic analyses . with the exception of these toc34-like sequences, the majority of aig <dig> sequences grouped primarily by taxonomy – generally by species, although a few individual sequences did not conform to this general trend. the three coral gimaps that are tightly linked form a strongly supported cluster in phylogenetic analyses, but the position of this clade in the broader analysis is not clear. representatives of other types of coral aig <dig> domain were phylogenetically distinct from the three linked genes, suggesting deep divergence. the phylogenomic analyses indicate that, as has been observed for several other gene families  <cit> , aig1/gimap genes have undergone multiple independent losses during evolution – at least seven independent losses within the animal kingdom alone – and several lineage-specific expansions.

discussion
the data presented here suggest that the acute transcriptional response of coral to immune challenge has some elements in common not only with mammals but also, perhaps more unexpectedly, with arthropods, as well as unique components. for example, in arthropods, an early response to challenge is proteolytic activation of pro-polyphenol oxidase  via a serine proteinase cascade ; we hypothesise that the trypsin-like serine protease  that is highly up-regulated after mdp challenge may play an analogous role in the propo activation observed upon damage to a. millepora and a species of porites <cit> . other coral genes up-regulated following mdp challenge have homologs characterised in the context of vertebrate immunity, the standout example being the three acropora gimap/ian genes. the pattern of up-regulation in response to the defined immunogen mdp suggests roles for the coral gimaps in the immune response to bacteria.

it is unclear why the aig <dig> domain that characterises gimap proteins is present in corals but appears to have been lost in other cnidarians. several other domains associated with immunity in higher animals are over-represented in coral compared to nematostella; for example, the coral repertoires of both toll-like receptors and nacht domain proteins are more extensive and complex than those of the sea anemone  <cit> , possibly reflecting the requirements of the symbiotic lifestyle of coral.

understanding the roles of gimaps in coral immunity is complicated not only by the difficulty of coral as an experimental system but also by the fact that little is known about how the corresponding proteins function in vertebrates. a number of the mammalian gimap family proteins function in b- and t-cell development, maturation and selection; several interact with specific bcl <dig> family members, participating in the regulation of apoptosis during lymphocyte development  <cit> . gimap4/ian <dig> interacts with the pro-apoptotic bax protein, whilst gimap3/ian <dig> and gimap5/ian <dig> interact specifically with the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl <dig> and bcl-xl  <cit> . it has been suggested that these interactions occur via the extended c-terminal domains of the mammalian gimap proteins  <cit> , but this remains to be verified. plant homologs of the mammalian gimaps are known  <cit> , and several of these have been implicated in immunity; in arabidopsis, aig <dig>  is induced by both the plant pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae <cit>  and the fungal pathogen phytophthora infestans <cit> , and atian <dig> and atian <dig> are strongly up-regulated on nematode infection  <cit> . however, arabidopsis ians are also induced by abiotic stressors such as heat or cold  <cit> , suggesting general stress-response roles rather than specific functions in immunity. moreover, there are no clear precedents for functional conservation between plant and animal immune systems, and convergence has often been mistaken for conservation. for example, the same combinations of domains function in pattern recognition in both plants and animals; the r-proteins implicated in plant immunity share domains in common with both the toll/tlr and nlr proteins that are the primary pattern recognition molecules in animals. whereas this was once thought to reflect conservation of function, it is now viewed as convergence  <cit> , most likely driven by the limited range of domains that can function in pattern recognition.

although the known roles of the mammalian gimaps - regulation of the survival and proliferation of lymphocyte lineages - undoubtedly reflect vertebrate-specific functions, this does not preclude older and more widely conserved functions for gimap proteins. if conserved roles are assumed, one possibility is that gimaps function at the level of phagolysosomal processing, which is a universal requirement for animal immune responses. the autophagy pathway has essential roles in immune responses  and in mammals, several other gtpases have critical roles in the induction of autophagy, phagosome maturation and the destruction of pathogens contained in vacuoles  <cit> . moreover, the structural properties of the gimap proteins are consistent with potential roles in membrane trafficking at phagolysosomal membranes, or perhaps  in constraining and compartmentalising pathogens within the cell. consistent with an ancient role of this sort for the gimap family, mammalian gimap <dig> has been shown to be associated with lysosomes  <cit> . hence, although neither derived functions nor convergence can be ruled out, the up-regulation observed in corals during immune challenge may reflect an ancestral function of this kind for the gimap gene family in the animal kingdom.

CONCLUSIONS
during the acute response of the coral a. millepora to mdp challenge, three genes encoding p-loop ntpases of the gimap/ian-type were strongly up-regulated, raising the possibility of common roles in coral and mammal  immunity. a phylogenomic survey of the gimap gene family implies ancient origins, multiple independent losses and lineage-specific expansions during animal evolution. whilst functional convergence cannot be ruled out, gimap expression in corals may reflect an ancestral role in immunity, perhaps in phagolysosomal processing.
