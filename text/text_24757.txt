BACKGROUND
sphingolipids regulate cellular processes such as migration, survival and differentiation  <cit> . sphingosine-1-phosphate , the most extensively studied of the bioactive sphingolipids, acts as a high affinity agonist at five known g protein-coupled receptors named s1p1-s1p <dig>  <cit> . the s1p-receptors are important for regulating cell migration  <cit> , proliferation and survival  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that s1p can act intracellularly as a calcium releasing second messenger  <cit>  and as a regulator of histone acetylation and transcription  <cit> . it is likely that some effects attributed to intracellular s1p can also be explained by signaling through internalized g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> .

s1p is synthesized through sphingosine kinase  -catalyzed phosphorylation of sphingosine. type  <dig> sphingosine kinase  is generally associated with cell survival, and several mechanisms for regulating its function have been identified. growth factors  <cit> , cytokines  <cit> , and even s1p itself  <cit>  have been shown to stimulate sphk-activity and s1p-production. erk1/ <dig> mediated phosphorylation on ser <dig> directly activates sphk <dig>  and this is also a prerequisite for the translocation of sphk <dig> to the plasma membrane  <cit> . furthermore, binding to ca2+-calmodulin has been shown to be crucial for translocation of sphk <dig> to the plasma membrane  <cit> . sphk <dig> may also be regulated by lipids such as phosphatidylserine  <cit>  or phosphatidic acid  <cit> .

an increase in sphk1-activity often correlates with enhanced survival and proliferation. several studies have shown that intracellular s1p is exported and acts on g protein coupled s1p-receptors to induce survival signaling  <cit> . sphk <dig> itself may also be exported from cells and retain its catalytic function in the extracellular space  <cit> , thus synthesizing s1p that has access to s1p-receptors in the plasma membrane.

in this study, we have investigated the signaling mechanisms activated by exogenous s1p, and in particular the effects of the subsequent increase in cellular s1p-production. we found that s1p mediated protection from death receptor-induced apoptosis in an nf-κb dependent manner. intriguingly, exogenously added s1p induced several cell types to synthesize and secrete additional s1p. the s1p that is secreted from cells can further enhance nf-κb activation through g protein coupled s1p-receptors. we demonstrate here that a g protein coupled receptor agonist can induce its own production and secretion at physiologically relevant levels.

s1p-production assay
cells  were incubated over night in medium with serum replaced by  <dig> % fatty acid-free bsa. cells were then stimulated with agonist or vehicle together with  sphingosine  with fatty acid free bsa as carrier. lipids were extracted by aspirating the culture medium and adding  <dig> μl of ice-cold methanol to the cells. cells were scraped from the petri dishes and transferred to eppendorf tubes. the tubes were sonicated for  <dig> minutes and then centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes to remove cell debris. the supernatant was then transferred to glass vials. s1p was added to each sample for identification and the supernatant was evaporated. for measurements of secreted s1p, s1p was extracted from the medium as previously described previously  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  ml of chloroform: methanol: hcl  was used to extract s1p from  <dig> μl medium. the organic phase was collected and evaporated. after re-dissolving in methanol the samples were spotted onto hptlc plates and separated with butan-1-ol: acetic acid: water . s1p was stained with ninhydrin and spots were scraped and the formed s1p was counted using liquid scintillation. from a typical experiment the recovered counts of intracellular and secreted s1p at basal conditions were  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm and  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm, respectively in hela cells. under similar conditions  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm was extracted from mel- <dig> cells and  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm from the medium. wm <dig> cells had a basal cellular s1p of  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm and secreted  <dig> ±  <dig> cpm.

construction of a viral vector containing human sphk <dig> and transduction of hela cells
human sphk cdna was cloned and flag -tagged at the 3' end according to pitson et al  <cit> . the sphk-flag fragment was pcr amplified by using primers with 5' mlui and 3' sali sites and cloned into the wpt-gfp lentiviral vector which had been digested with mlui and sali to remove the gfp gene. lentiviral vectors expressing the sphk-flag construct were produced by transient three plasmid cotransfection into hek 293t cells by using calcium phosphate precipitation. the three plasmid mixture consisted of  <dig>  μg wpt-sphkflag,  <dig>  μg pcmvΔr <dig>  and  <dig>  μg md.g . the virus-containing media were harvested  <dig> hours later by filtering the media through  <dig>  μm pore size filter and centrifuging at  <dig>  <dig> g for  <dig>  h at +4°c. the resulting pellets were resuspended in  <dig> μl serum free dmem. for transduction hela cells were plated on 6-well plates  and  <dig> hours later virus together with  <dig> μg/ml polybrene was added at multiplicity of infection  <dig> and incubated for  <dig> hours after which time the medium was replaced with fresh medium.

sirna mediated knock down
the cells were grown to 90% confluency, and transfection was done with n-ter transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol for serum-free transfection with slight modifications. the sirna was added to the cells at a final concentration of  <dig> nm. following a  <dig> hour incubation with the sirna reagent, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing  <dig> % fatty acid free bsa. following another  <dig> h incubation the cells were used for experiments.

nf-κb activation assay
cells grown on  <dig> mm petri dishes were harvested and pelleted in ice cold pbs. the cell pellet was quick-freezed and resuspended in  <dig> μl buffer containing 25% glycerol,  <dig>  m nacl,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm edta,  <dig> mm hepes ,  <dig>  mm dtt, and  <dig>  mm pmsf. the extract was then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes at +4°c. the supernatant was collected and protein concentrations were determined. two methods for assaying nf-κb  dna-binding activity were used. nfκb transactivation capacity was measured from the extracts either by using a trans-am nf-κb  transcription factor assay kit  according to the manufacturers' instructions, or by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . the results from the trans-am nf-κb  transcription factor assay kit are presented as percent activation with the stimulated control set to 100% and the unstimulated control as 0%. this was made to compensate for between-experiment differences in nf-κb activation. for the emsa experiments, the consensus nf-κb binding site  was 32p-labeled. protein-dna complexes were separated on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel. the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography film over night. both methods measure nf-κb activity by detecting it binding to its consensus binding sequence.

RESULTS
s1p stimulates nf-κb dependent cell survival
it has been firmly established that s1p is a cytoprotective agent. however, the downstream mechanisms are pleiotropic and have only been partially identified. to study the s1p-induced survival signaling pathways we first needed to identify a reproducible and quantifiable endpoint. nf-κb is a well-defined survival factor, and there are reports showing that s1p activates nf-κb by signaling through g-protein coupled s1p receptors  <cit> . nf-κb activation was therefore ideal to use as an endpoint for addressing s1p signaling pathways leading to survival. in our initial experiments, we could confirm the importance of nf-κb in s1p mediated survival signaling. s1p protected hela cells from fas ligand-induced apoptosis in an nf-κb dependent manner . s1p also induced an upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-xl which was blocked by the nf-κb inhibitor bay 11- <dig> .

s1p activates nf-κb through g protein coupled receptors
s1p induces most of its functions by activating g protein coupled s1p receptors, but an intracellular mode of action has been proposed to take place in some cases. we therefore addressed the site of action for s1p-induced nf-κb activation in hela cells. the receptors s1p1- <dig> and s1p <dig> were detectable by pcr and western blot in hela cells . s1p induced nf-κb activation with an ec <dig> of  <dig> nm, which is consistent with a g protein coupled receptor -mediated effect . furthermore, the s1p-induced nf-κb activation was attenuated by the gi inhibitor pertussis toxin, by the s1p <dig> antagonist jte <dig>  and in s1p <dig> sirna treated cells . the s1p1/ <dig> antagonist vpc  <dig> did not inhibit the s1p induced nfκb activation indicating that the effect is not dependent on s1p <dig> or s1p <dig> . in addition, dihydro-s1p potently activated nf-κb . dihydro-s1p binds and activates g protein coupled s1p receptors and has often been used as a negative control for intracellular effects of s1p  <cit> . taken together, these results show that the s1p induced activation of nf-κb is mediated through an extracellular mode of action. it is known that extracellular s1p can cause cells to increase their intracellular production of s1p  <cit> . to exclude the possibility that intracellularly produced s1p was responsible for the nf-κb response, we measured the activation of nf-κb in cells treated with sphingosine kinase inhibitors. the cells were stimulated with  <dig> μm s1p to saturate g-protein coupled s1p receptors and to achieve maximal nf-κb activation . under these conditions, the sphingosine kinase inhibitors dms and ski effectively blocked both the basal and agonist-induced s1p-production . however, the nf-κb activation induced by extracellular s1p was not significantly affected . these observations are in line with earlier studies  <cit>  showing that s1p-induced nf-κb -activation is mediated through gpcr's.

nf-κb activation induced by exogenously added s1p is enhanced by s1p produced and secreted by the cells
extracellularly added s1p induced a transient increase in cellular s1p-production , accompanied by an increased secretion of s1p . the s1p-induced s1p-production was inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting dependence on gpcr-signaling . the s1p induced s1p-production displayed a saturable concentration response curve, with a noticeable response following stimulation with  <dig> nm extracellular s1p . there are now several reports showing that intracellularly produced s1p can be exported and act on cells in an autocrine or paracrine fashion  <cit> . since extracellular s1p stimulated the cells' own production and secretion of s1p, we hypothesized that this could constitute a self amplifying signaling mechanism. when cells are stimulated with high concentrations of extracellular s1p, such a mechanism will not be noticeable, since all s1p-receptors will be saturated and not affected by any additional s1p that is secreted from the cells. however, if non-saturating concentrations of s1p are added to the cells, endogenously produced and secreted s1p might have an enhancing effect. to test this hypothesis we did concentration-response measurements for s1p-induced nf-κb activation with or without sphingosine kinase inhibition. a higher concentration of extracellular s1p was needed to achieve half-maximal nf-κb-activation in sphk <dig> sirna treated cells compared to control cells . in additional experiments we found that there was a shift in the ec <dig> value from  <dig> nm in control cells  to  <dig> nm in cells treated with  <dig> μm dms. this shift is large enough to be significant for g-protein signaling, i.e. at the ec <dig> concentration, approximately half of the activating s1p is of cellular origin. taken together, these results are in support of a model where s1p signaling is amplified through an autocrine feed-forward loop.

effect of prolonged overexpression of sphk on nf-κb activation and s1p synthesis
next, we performed studies on cells overexpressing sphk <dig>  a lentivirus based system was utilized for overexpressing human sphk <dig> in hela cells. extracellular s1p efficiently activated nf-κb in mock-transduced cells. this activation was blocked by gi protein inhibition, confirming the dependence on gpcr-signaling. interestingly, in cells overexpressing sphk <dig>  exogenous s1p only weakly activated nf-κb . the cellular level of the receptor s1p <dig> was not affected by sphk <dig> overexpression , suggesting that this observation is likely explained by homologous desensitization of s1p <dig> receptors without subsequent receptor degradation as shown by jolly et al  <cit> . since the nf-κb activation was mediated through g protein coupled s1p-receptors and independent of an intracellular action of s1p, these results seem to confirm that autocrine s1p modulates nf-κb signaling. cells overexpressing sphk had an elevated basal s1p production of  <dig> ± 130% compared to control cells . treating the sphk overexpressing cells with pertussis toxin for  <dig> h lead to a significant decrease in the amount of secreted s1p , which is in line with an autocrine feed-forward loop upholding the production and secretion of s1p.

signaling cascades regulating s1p-induced s1p-production and s1p-induced activation of nf-κb
pkc, phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase , mitogen activated protein kinase  and ca2+ are effectors known to act downstream of s1p-receptors. we therefore compared the roles of these signaling components in s1p-induced activation of nf-κb and in s1p-induced s1p-production. the intracellular ca2+ chelator bapta-am, the pkc inhibitor gf109203× and the pi3k inhibitor wortmannin attenuated the s1p-induced nf-κb-activation, whereas the mapk-kinase  inhibitor pd <dig> was without an effect . the s1p-induced increase in cellular s1p-production was completely blocked by pd <dig>  slightly reduced by ca2+ chelation, and not significantly affected by neither gf109203× nor wortmannin, . these results are in accordance with previous findings that erk1/ <dig> and ca2+ are important factors for activating and translocating sphk to the plasma membrane respectively  <cit> . these results illustrate that s1p utilizes different signaling pathways to induce activation of nf-κb and to stimulate s1p-production.

s1p-induced secretion of s1p in the malignant tumor cell lines mel- <dig> and wm35
we used the two malignant melanoma cell lines mel- <dig> and wm <dig> to test whether our proposed self-amplifying autocrine loop is also present in other than hela cells. in both cell lines, the secretion of s1p was enhanced by the addition of exogenous s1p . this suggests that the described self-amplifying autocrine signaling is common also in other types of tumor cells. since the mel- <dig> cells displayed a higher basal secretion of s1p , we tested whether sphingosine kinase was involved in survival signaling in this cell line. we found that inhibition of sphingosine kinase per se did not render the tumor cells apoptotic, but sensitized them to apoptosis induced by trail , a selective inducer of death in many transformed cells but not in most normal cells. to address whether this effect was due to secreted s1p, we repeated the experiment in cells treated with jte <dig> and vpc <dig> to block signaling via s1p1- <dig> . similar to what was observed in cells treated with ski, the receptor antagonists alone did not affect apoptosis, but increased the potency of trail to induce cell death. this indicates that the observed effect is due to s1p secretion rather than an intracellular mode of action. down-regulation of the self-amplifying s1p signaling in combination with trail treatment is therefore potentially useful in cancer therapy.

discussion
our knowledge regarding how sphingolipids regulate cell survival or death has been rapidly increasing since the concept of a sphingolipid "rheostat" was first introduced. s1p has emerged as a central bio-active lipid with both intracellular and extracellular actions. there is some controversy surrounding sphingolipids and their sites of action in survival signaling. since one type of sphingolipid may be rapidly converted into another sphingolipid with opposite effects on survival, it has proven difficult to determine to which extent each lipid-type is responsible for the outcome of the signaling. in the present report we show that s1p antagonizes death receptor-induced apoptosis in hela cells by acting through g protein-coupled s1p receptors and activating the transcription factor nf-κb. s1p <dig> was at least in part responsible for activating nf-κb, but it seems likely that s1p promotes survival through simultaneous activation of several signaling cascades. it has previously been shown that s1p may activate nf-κb through s1p <dig> and s1p <dig> in a plc/pkc-dependent manner  <cit> . we could confirm that the activation was dependent on pkc and on s1p <dig> in hela cells. the pi3k inhibitor wortmannin also attenuated the s1p-induced activation of nf-κb, in accordance with what has been shown in vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> .

it was first shown by meyer zu heringdorf et al  <cit> , and later by us  <cit>  that s1p may stimulate its own intracellular synthesis, but whether this also leads to an increase in s1p-secretion has not been previously investigated. we show here that s1p not only stimulates the production of intracellular s1p, but also its secretion. based on concentration response curves for the s1p-induced nf-κb activation in figure  <dig>  we conclude that the secreted s1p is an important contributing factor in s1p signaling. the s1p-induced s1p-synthesis was sensitive to mek-inhibition, but not to inhibition of pkc or pi3k. the opposite was true for s1p-induced nf-κb-activation, which suggests that these two mechanisms can be regulated independently of each other. this was further illustrated by the fact that the s1p <dig> antagonist jte <dig>  and s1p <dig> knockdown attenuated the s1p-induced activation of nf-κb, while the s1p-induced s1p-production was unaffected. in conclusion, the results we present here lend support to a novel feed-forward mechanism, with s1p stimulating its own synthesis and secretion. the secreted s1p may then protect the tumor cells from death receptor-induced apoptosis by contributing to nf-κb activation. an important consequence of the autocrine feed-forward signaling is that an initially small increase in the cells' s1p-production can be considerably amplified. the secreted s1p provides protection for the tumor cell itself, and may also activate a similar feed-forward mechanism in surrounding cells. in addition to stimulating cell survival, s1p also induces cell proliferation  <cit>  and angiogenesis  <cit> . these factors are crucial for tumor development and metastasis.

CONCLUSIONS
s1p protects hela cells from fasl-evoked apoptosis in an nf-kb-dependent manner. we propose that this effect is mediated by a cytoprotective mechanism involving an amplification loop where s1p stimulates its own production and secretion by activating g protein coupled s1p-receptors. it is likely that the mechanism presented here is important for tumor progression.
