BACKGROUND
the binding of transcription factors  to the promoters of their target genes is one of the most important mechanisms for transcriptional regulation of gene expression. therefore, knowing the binding targets of tfs is helpful for understanding how cells respond to stimuli by regulating the gene expression repertoire. in  <dig>  harbison et al.  <cit>  performed chip-chip experiments to determine the binding targets of  <dig> yeast tfs in the rich media condition. since then, many computational methods have used this tf binding dataset to reconstruct yeast transcriptional regulatory networks  <cit> . these methods are all based on one assumption: most, if not all, binding targets of a tf are regulated by this tf. this assumption is supported by three computational studies which estimate about 60% of the binding targets of a tf are indeed the regulatory targets of this tf  <cit> .

however, this assumption was challenged by an experimental study conducted by hu et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . they performed microarray experiments to identify the differentially expressed genes in each of  <dig> tf knockout strains in the rich media condition. then they compared the set of genes bound by a tf  with the set of genes differentially expressed when this tf is knocked out . surprisingly, they found that only 3% of the binding targets of a tf are affected by the knockout of this tf. that is, only 3% of the binding targets of a tf are indeed regulated by this tf.

biologists are puzzled by this extremely low percentage and researchers have tried to explain this counterintuitive phenomenon. several computational studies showed that by cleaning the noises in the tf binding dataset and applying advanced statistical analysis tools for the identification of differentially expressed genes in the tf knockout effect dataset, the percentage can only be improved to 6%, indicating that data analysis issue is not the main reason that causes this extremely low percentage  <cit> . therefore, researchers started to find biological explanations for the low percentage. two computational studies have shown that co-expression, protein sequence homology and shared protein-protein interactions may lead to one tf compensating for another, thus masking the tf knockout effect on the binding targets of the knocked-out tf  <cit> . in this study, our goal is to find out other plausible biological explanations for the surprisingly low percentage. our analyses suggest that one tf property  may lead to one tf compensating for another, thus masking the tf knockout effect on the binding targets of the knocked-out tf. in addition, we show that seven gene properties , low transcriptional plasticity, a low number of bound tfs, a low number of tfbss, and a short average distance of tfbss to the tss) are associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs.

methods
tf binding dataset and tf knockout effect dataset
the tf binding dataset was downloaded from harbison et al.'s study  <cit> . they performed chip-chip experiments to determine the significantly  bound genes of  <dig> yeast tfs in the rich media condition. the tf knockout effect dataset was downloaded from hu et al.'s study  <cit> . they performed microarray experiments to identify the significantly  differentially expressed genes in each of  <dig> tf knockout strains grown in the rich media condition, the same growth condition used in the chip-chip experiments conducted by harbison et al.  <cit> . a previous study showed that using the p-value threshold of  <dig>  yields the highest overlap between the tf binding dataset and tf knockout effect dataset  <cit> , so we adopted  <dig>  as the p-value threshold in this study. of the  <dig> tfs in the tf binding dataset,  <dig> were also in the tf knockout effect dataset. therefore, the binding and knockout effect data of these  <dig> tfs were used in this study, which contained  <dig> tf-gene binding relationships and  <dig> tf-gene knockout effects among  <dig> tfs and  <dig> genes. then we compared the set of genes bound by a tf with the set of genes differentially expressed when this tf is knocked out. similar to previous studies  <cit> , on average only 4%  of the tf-gene binding relationships had the tf-gene knockout effects. that is, only 4% of the tf binding dataset was overlapped with the tf knockout effect dataset.

calculation of the functional redundancy of each tf
the procedure of calculating the functional redundancy of tf t is as follows. first, calculate the functional similarity  between tf t and tf q using the jaccard similarity coefficient

 fs=|at∩aq||at∪aq|, 

where at is the set of functional annotation terms assigned to tf t  according gene ontology database  <cit>  and mips functional catalogue database  <cit>  and |at ∩ aq| is the number of common functional annotation terms of tf t and tf q. note that  <dig> ≤ fs ≤  <dig>  fs =  <dig> when tf t and tf q have completely the same set of functional annotation terms and fs =  <dig> when tf t and tf q have completely different sets of functional annotation terms. then the functional redundancy  of tf t is defined as

  fr=maxqfs. 

note that  <dig> ≤ fr ≤  <dig>  tf t would have high functional redundancy if there exists another tf q whose functions are highly similar to the functions of tf t.

overlap percentage  calculation
following gitter et al.'s approach  <cit> , the percentage of the tf binding dataset that is overlapped with the tf knockout effect dataset for m  is calculated as

  op=∑t∈m|gb∩gk|∑t∈m|gb| 

where gb is the set of genes significantly bound by tf t, gk is the set of genes significantly affected by the knockout of tf t, and |gb| is the number of genes significantly bound by tf t.

similarly, the percentage of the tf binding dataset that is overlapped with the tf knockout effect dataset for n  is calculated as

  op=∑g∈n|tb∩tk|∑g∈n|tb| 

where tb is the set of tfs which significantly bind to gene g and tk the set of tfs which significantly affect the expression of gene g when they are knocked out.

RESULTS
the overlap percentage varies among different tfs and different genes
although on average only 4% of the tf binding dataset is overlapped with the tf knockout effect dataset, the percentage actually varies among different tfs and different genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  the percentage for different tfs varies between 0% and 36% and the percentage for different genes varies between 0% and 100% . identifying biological features that are associated with the overlap percentage may lead to biological explanations of the surprisingly low percentage of the binding targets of a tf affected when this tf is knocked out.

functional redundancy of tfs explains why most binding targets of a transcription factor are not affected when the transcription factor is knocked out
in order to test whether functional redundancy may lead to one tf compensating for another, thus masking the tf knockout effect on the binding targets of the knocked-out tf, let us define two sets of tfs. the first is the set of tfs with high functional redundancy, which is defined as those tfs whose functional redundancy calculated using equation  are among the top x%  of the  <dig> tfs under study. the other is the set of tfs with low functional redundancy, which is defined as those tfs whose functional redundancy are among the bottom x% of the  <dig> tfs under study. as shown in figure  <dig>  tfs with high functional redundancy show significantly lower overlap percentage ) than do tfs with low functional redundancy, suggesting that functional redundancy may explain why most binding targets of a tf are not affected when the tf is knocked out. note that our result is robust against different choices  of x and different sources  of functional annotation terms being used.

lowly expressed genes have lower overlap percentage
since both chip-chip and tf knockout experiments were performed on the yeast cells grown in the rich media condition, we speculate that lowly expressed genes in the rich media condition have lower percentage of the tf binding dataset overlapped with the tf knockout effect dataset than do highly expressed genes. to test our speculation, let us define two sets of genes. the first is the set of lowly expressed genes, which is defined as those genes whose expression levels are among the bottom x%  of the  <dig> genes under study. the other is the set of highly expressed genes, which is defined as those genes whose expression levels are among the top x% of the  <dig> genes under study . the gene expression data in the rich media condition was downloaded from holstege et al.'s study  <cit>  and nagalakshmi et al.'s study  <cit> . as shown in figures 3a and 3b, lowly expressed genes show significantly lower overlap percentage ) compared with highly expressed genes, suggesting that low expression level is associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs. note that our result is robust against different choices  of x and different sources  of gene expression data being used.

ribosomal genes are known to be highly transcribed in the rich media condition. if our finding is biologically meaningful, we expect that ribosomal genes have higher overlap percentage compared with the rest of the  <dig> genes under study. to test this assertion, we downloaded two lists of ribosomal genes from kegg ribosome pathway: sce <dig>  <cit>  and mips functional category:  <dig> . <dig> ribosomal proteins  <cit> . as expected, ribosomal genes show significantly higher overlap percentage ) compared with the rest of the  <dig> genes under study , thus further strengthen our finding. note that our result is robust against different sources  of the list of ribosomal genes being used.

tata box-less genes have lower overlap percentage
it is known that tata box-less and tata box-containing genes are distinctly regulated  <cit> . tata box-less genes tend to be housekeeping genes, have a sharply peaked tf binding site  distribution and are constitutively expressed, while tata box-containing genes are usually associated with environmental stress responses, dispersed tfbs distribution and variably expressed under different conditions  <cit> . it is interesting to know whether these two classes of genes differ in their overlap percentage. the lists of tata box-less genes and tata box-containing genes were downloaded from basehoar et al.'s study  <cit> . depending on how stringent the criterion for defining a tata box is, three possible lists of tata box-containing genes were defined by basehoar et al.  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  tata box-less genes show significantly lower overlap percentage ) compared with tata box-containing genes, suggesting that lacking a tata box is associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs. note that our result is robust against different criteria of defining tata box-containing genes.

genes containing a nucleosome-free region  have lower overlap percentage
in yeast, the capacity to modulate gene expression upon changing conditions  correlates with the organization of their promoter nucleosomes  <cit> . genes containing an nfr immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site  are characterized by low transcriptional plasticity, while genes lacking an nfr immediately upstream of the tss are characterized by high transcriptional plasticity. it is interesting to know whether these two classes of genes differ in their overlap percentage. the lists of genes containing and lacking an nfr were both downloaded from tirosh and baikai's study  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, genes containing an nfr show significantly lower overlap percentage ) compared with genes lacking an nfr, suggesting that containing an nfr immediately upstream of the tss is associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs.

it is known that genes lacking an nfr are subjected to greater regulation by specific chromatin remodelling factors than are genes containing an nfr  <cit> . if our finding is biologically meaningful, we expect that tfs involved in chromatin remodelling have higher overlap percentage compared with the rest of the  <dig> tfs under study. to test this assertion, we downloaded the list of tfs involved in chromatin remodelling from ozonov and van nimwegen's study  <cit> . as expected, tfs involved in chromatin remodelling show significantly higher overlap percentage ) compared with the rest of the  <dig> tfs under study , thus further strengthen our finding.

genes with low transcriptional plasticity have lower overlap percentage
we have shown that two classes of genes  have lower overlap percentage. since both classes of genes are known to have low transcriptional plasticity  <cit> , this prompts us to speculate that genes with low transcriptional plasticity have lower percentage of the tf binding dataset overlapped with the tf knockout effect dataset than do genes with high transcriptional plasticity. to test our speculation, let us define two sets of genes. the first is the set of genes with low transcriptional plasticity, which is defined as those genes whose transcriptional plasticity are among the bottom x% of the  <dig> genes under study. the other is the set of genes with high transcriptional plasticity, which is defined as those genes whose transcriptional plasticity are among the top x% of the  <dig> genes under study . the transcriptional plasticity each gene in the yeast genome was downloaded from lin et al.'s study  <cit> . as shown in figure 5c, genes with low transcriptional plasticity show significantly lower overlap percentage ) than do genes with high transcriptional plasticity, suggesting that low transcriptional plasticity is associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs. note that our result is robust against different choices  of x being used.

several gene properties are not associated with the overlap percentage
in the previous sections, we show that four gene properties  are associated with the overlap percentage. actually, five other gene properties are also tested but do not have statistically significant association with the overlap percentage. these five gene properties include the 5'utr length, 3'utr length, gene essentiality, number of physical interaction partners and number of genetic interaction partners.

more analyses motivated by cusanovich et al's study
in cusanovich et al.'s paper  <cit> , they reported that functional tf binding is enriched in the regulatory regions with a larger number of bound tfs and more binding sites. moreover, functional tf binding tends to occur further from the tss . motivated by their findings, we perform extra analyses and have the following three observations:  a low number of bound tfs in a gene,  a low number of tfbss in a gene, and  a short average distance of tfbss to the tss in a gene are all associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs .

CONCLUSIONS
this study gives a plausible biological explanation of a counterintuitive phenomenon: most binding targets of a yeast transcription factor are not affected when the transcription factor is knocked out. our analyses find that tfs with high functional redundancy show significantly lower percentage than do tfs with low functional redundancy. this suggests that functional redundancy may lead to one tf compensating for another, thus masking the tf knockout effect on the binding targets of the knocked-out tf. in addition, identifying biological features that are associated with the overlap percentage may provide clues for finding other biological explanations. we show that seven gene properties  are associated with a gene being insensitive to the knockout of its promoter-binding tfs.
