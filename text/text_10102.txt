BACKGROUND
cpg islands  are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc-rich regions. they are often associated with the 5' end of genes and considered gene markers  <cit> . methylation of promoter-associated cgis plays an important role in gene regulation and carcinogenesis. because of the functional importance, multiple algorithms have been available for identifying cgis in a sequence. traditional algorithms are based on three sequence parameters ) that were originally proposed by gardiner-garden and frommer in  <dig>  <cit>  and later revised by takai and jones  <cit>  and others. these algorithms have been widely used in the identification of cgis in numerous studies. among these algorithms, takai and jones'  <cit>  stringent algorithm seems to outperform the others because it can effectively exclude short interspersed elements such as alu and it can identify cgis that are more likely associated with the 5' regions of genes  <cit> .

recently, hackenberg et al.  <cit>  developed a new algorithm, namely cpgcluster. cpgcluster does not employ the three parameters typically used in traditional algorithms, rather, it detects clusters of cpgs  by statistical significance based on the physical distance between neighboring cpgs on a chromosome  <cit> . to save the space and to compare the cgis by takai and jones' algorithm, we abbreviate cpg clusters as "cgcs" hereafter. both cgis and cgcs represent the islands of cpgs in a genome. their evaluation claimed a better performance of cpgcluster due to its better benchmark, minimal overlap with alu, and higher degree of overlap with promoter and phylogenetic conserved elements. here we performed an extensive evaluation of the two algorithms  in two model organisms  and demonstrated that takai and jones' algorithm has an overall better performance in the identification of cgis in vertebrate genomes.

cgis versus cgcs: evaluation on gene markers
the main interest in finding islands of cpgs is that they may serve as gene markers  <cit> . mammalian genomes have similar sizes  and similar numbers of annotated genes   <cit> . surprisingly, the number of cgcs in the human genome is ~ <dig> times that of human genes and the number of mouse cgcs is ~ <dig> times that of mouse genes. in contrast to the cgcs, the total number of human cgis  is moderately larger than the number of human genes and the total number of mouse cgis  is even in the low range of the estimated number of mouse genes. it is worth noting that the mouse genome has undergone faster cgi loss than the human during genome evolution  <cit> , thus, we observed a smaller number in the mouse genome by both algorithms.

we then examined the distribution of cgis or cgcs in different genomic regions including promoter, genic and intergenic regions . among the  <dig>  human cgis,  <dig> % were mapped to the promoter regions. however, only  <dig> % of the  <dig>  human cgcs were mapped to the promoter regions . similarly, we found  <dig> % of mouse cgis but only  <dig> % of mouse cgcs mapped to the promoter regions. we had a similar observation when we examined the coverage of islands of cpgs with the transcriptional start sites . for example, we observed  <dig> % of the human cgis but only  <dig> % of human cgcs covering tsss . most human cgcs  are located outside of the promoter regions and about half are in the intergenic regions.

it is interesting to examine the short cgcs identified by cpgcluster. the shortest cgcs were found to be  <dig> bp in both the human and mouse genomes. for the 8-bp cgcs, we counted a total of  <dig> times in humans and  <dig> times in mice. hackenberg et al. suggested that the very short islands might be functional because they likely overlap with the promoter regions. however, even this is true, we found only few short cgcs  are located in the promoter regions. in fact, the majority of them are in the intergenic regions . furthermore, we found all these 8-bp cgcs are octamer cgcgcgcg. our preliminary search in the transfac and jaspar databases indicates that this octamer is rarely part of the regulatory motifs. similar distribution was observed for cgcs whose length is ≤  <dig> bp . these results indicate that short cgcs may not serve as markers for genes.

cgis versus cgcs: length distribution
the main difference between the two algorithms is that takai and jones' algorithm requires a minimal length but cpgcluster does not. the shortest cgcs have only  <dig> bp compared to the minimum length of  <dig> bp by takai and jones' algorithm. here we compared the length distribution of cgcs and cgis in the human and mouse genomes. as expected, the length distribution of the two algorithms is remarkably different. in humans, most cgcs are in a range of  <dig> –  <dig> bp long , while only  <dig> % of cgcs are longer than  <dig> bp. for those long cgcs , their number distribution is not strongly different from that of cgis .

ioshikhes and zhang  <cit>  found that the cgis overlapping with tss are much longer than those outside the gene environment. a similar pattern was observed for cgcs  <cit> . here we examined and compared the length distribution for promoter-associated cgcs and intergenic cgcs. when cgcs are shorter than  <dig> bp in the human genome and  <dig> bp in the mouse genome, the proportion of promoter-associated cgcs is smaller than that of intergenic cgcs, indicating that those short cgcs are more likely in the intergenic regions rather than in the promoter regions . conversely, when the length is >  <dig> bp, the proportion of promoter-associated cgcs is noticeably larger than that of intergenic cgcs in both the genomes. the result indicates that the length is an important factor in identifying islands of cpgs that are associated with the promoter regions and, thus, effectively reducing the false positives.

multiple cgcs or cgis in a promoter region
because the number of cgcs is remarkably larger than that of genes in both the human and mouse genomes, it is necessary to examine whether multiple cgcs or cgis are located in a genic or promoter region. among the  <dig>  human genes extracted from the ncbi refseq database, we found that  <dig>   have more than  <dig> cgc but only  <dig>  have more than  <dig> cgi. this strong difference was similarly found in the mouse genome .

our further examination revealed that many promoter-associated cgcs are short and "clustered" with short gaps at a locus. in some extreme cases, we found 5– <dig> cgcs in a promoter region. figure  <dig> shows two examples: cap <dig> and adam <dig>  cap <dig>  a 32-kb long gene, has five cgcs that lie within its promoter region, but has only one cgi  identified by takai and jones' algorithm. these five cgcs are embedded in that cgi, separated by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively . for adam <dig>  a 14-kb long gene, we identified five cgcs that lie within or overlap with its promoter region where only one cgi  was identified . three of these cgcs  are nearly embedded in the cgi. the other two cgcs  locate in the upstream of the cgi. interestingly, both cgc <dig> and cgc <dig> are overall within an alu element , which supports that takai and jones' algorithm could effectively exclude the repeats. this reflects that cpgcluster tends to identify small parts of cpg islands and, therefore, results in a substantially inflated number of short cgcs.

we next examined the distance  between two neighboring cgcs in the promoter regions. among promoter-associated cgcs,  <dig> % of them have distance < <dig> bp in the human genome; this proportion is  <dig> % in the mouse . moreover,  <dig> % of human cgcs and  <dig> % of mouse cgcs are separated more than  <dig> bp. of note, takai and jones' algorithm requires cgis to be separated at least  <dig> bp, otherwise they would be merged  <cit> . when the distance is > <dig> bp, the proportions are similar in these two genomes . furthermore, we found similar distribution of distance between two neighboring cgcs in the promoter regions of human-mouse homologous genes . this again suggests that the length is an important factor.

cgis versus cgcs: evaluation on methylation status in the promoter regions
functional gc-rich regions are often unmethylated, which is an important feature in the regulation of gene expression. ideally, a computationally identified cgi or cgc is associated with a promoter region that is unmethylated or hypomethylated. to evaluate the performance of these two algorithms on predicting islands of cpgs that are unmethylated or hypomethylated, we obtained  <dig>  genes with methylation status in their promoter regions from weber et al.  <cit> . we calculated sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and correlation coefficient . although cpgcluster has a slightly better sensitivity  and accuracy , its specificity  is noticeably lower than that  of takai and jones' algorithm. when all factors combined, we found a larger correlation coefficient by takai and jones' algorithm  than cpgcluster .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we systematically compared two representative algorithms: takai and jones' algorithm and the distance-based algorithm aiming for identifying functional cpg clusters. our comparison of the number of islands versus the number of genes in a genome, the distribution of islands in different genomic regions, the length distribution, the distance between two neighboring islands in the promoter regions, and methylation status suggests that takai and jones' algorithm is overall more appropriate for identifying promoter-associated islands of cpgs. although cpgcluster can uniquely identify some short cpg clusters that are functional, its high false positive rate strongly limits its utility in genome-wide or chromosome-wide searching promoter-associated cpg clusters in vertebrate genomes. since cpg islands represent an important gene feature and are expected to be used extensively in gene prediction, gene feature analysis, and epigenetic and epigenomic projects, the information in our study is fundamental.
