BACKGROUND
nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for plant growth and development. plants can utilize different forms of nitrogen including nitrate, ammonium, and amino acids. most plants use inorganic nitrogen nitrate as the primary nitrogen source. nitrate taken up from the soil will be reduced to ammonium by nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. ammonium derived from nitrate or remobilized from the other nitrogen-containing compounds can be assimilated into glutamine and glutamate via the glutamine synthetase /glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase  cycle. glutamine and glutamate are the major amino donors for the synthesis of the other amino acids and nitrogen-containing compounds in plants  <cit> . in addition to their roles in protein synthesis and metabolism, glutamine and glutamate may also serve as signaling molecules in plants  <cit> .

the synthesis of glutamine and glutamate also depends on the availability of α-ketoglutarate. in bacteria, the carbon skeleton of ammonia assimilation, α-ketoglutarate, signals nitrogen deficiency, whereas glutamine, the fully aminated product, often signals nitrogen sufficiency  <cit> . in e. coli, the expression of glutamine synthetase gene and its enzyme activity are regulated by the availability of glutamine and α-ketoglutarate  <cit> . in response to low glutamine/α-ketoglutarate, the e. coli pii protein  is uridylylated by glnd, an uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme  <cit> . the uridylylated pii interacts with an adenylyltransferase to deadenylylate and activate the gs enzyme   <cit> . in addition, the ntrb/ntrc two-component system will activate the expression of glna under nitrogen-limiting conditions  <cit> . by contrast, in response to high glutamine/α-ketoglutarate, the uridylylated pii is deuridylylated by glnd. the unmodified pii protein interacts with adenylyltransferase thereby causing the adenylylation and inactivation of the gs enzyme  <cit> . the unmodified pii protein also interacts with the ntrb/ntrc two-component system to inactivate the expression of glna  <cit> . thus bacterial pii proteins are sensors of α-ketoglutarate and adenylate energy charge, whereas glnd is the sensor of glutamine  <cit> .

little is known about amino acid sensing and signaling in plants. pii-like proteins have been identified in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . however, bacterial glnd homologs have yet to be identified in plants. the e. coli sensor protein glnd is composed of a nucleotide transferase domain, a nucleotide hydrolase domain, and two c-terminal act domains. it has been shown that the c-terminal act domains of glnd may regulate its activity through the binding of glutamine  <cit> .

the act domain, named after bacterial aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase and tyra , is a regulatory domain that serves as an amino acid-binding site in feedback-regulated amino acid metabolic enzymes  <cit> . for instance, the e. coli 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase , a key enzyme in serine biosynthesis, is feedback regulated by serine. the c-terminal act domain of e. coli pgdh is the binding site for its allosteric effector serine  <cit> . the other amino acid metabolic enzymes such as acetohydroxyacid synthase  <cit> , threonine deaminase  <cit> , and phenylalanine hydroxylase  <cit>  also contain the regulatory act domain. in addition, the act domain is also found in several transcription factors  <cit> .

we previously identified a novel type of act domain-containing protein family in arabidopsis, whose members contain four act domain repeats   <cit> . other than the act domain, the amino acid sequences of the acr proteins do not have homology to any known enzymes or motifs in the database . although proteins homologous to the acr family have been identified in rice  <cit> , the functions of these acr proteins are largely unknown.

in this report, we have identified four additional act domain-containing proteins in arabidopsis. these proteins are composed of three or two copies of the act domain. the amino acid sequences of these proteins do not have any recognizable motifs except the act domain. these novel act domain-containing proteins are classified as new members of the acr family. we showed that the newly identified acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins are localized to the chloroplast. interestingly, the expression of acr <dig> is co-regulated with gln <dig> that encodes a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase . the possible functions of arabidopsis acr <dig> are discussed herein.

RESULTS
identification of four novel acr genes in arabidopsis
we previously used the act domain  and bacterial glnd sequences to identify arabidopsis acr <dig> to acr <dig> proteins, which contain four copies of the act domain  <cit> . in addition to these acr proteins, we have identified four novel act domain-containing proteins encoded by at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at2g <dig> and at5g <dig>  which contain two or three copies of the act domain. since these proteins also contain act domain repeats, we propose to classify these proteins as new members of the acr family. we named the proteins encoded by at2g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at5g <dig> genes acr <dig>  acr <dig>  acr <dig> and acr <dig>  respectively. according to amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, acr <dig> to acr <dig> proteins are divided into three groups . the originally identified acr <dig> to acr <dig> proteins belong to group i. the newly identified acr <dig> to acr <dig> belong to group ii  and group iii , respectively .

acr <dig> and acr <dig> have almost identical gene structures with respect to size and arrangement of their exons and introns . by contrast, acr <dig> and acr <dig> have the same numbers of exon and intron, but some of the introns are different in size . we used the computer program interproscan  to analyze domain compositions of acr <dig> to acr <dig>  the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins contain three copies of the act domain, whereas the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins contain two copies of the act domain . similar to the acr <dig> to acr <dig> proteins, the acr <dig> to acr <dig> proteins do not have other known domains or motifs as revealed by interproscan.

sequence analysis of arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr12
according to the sequences in the genbank, we designed specific primers and used rt-pcr to amplify full-length cdnas of acr <dig> and acr <dig>  the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins have  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues, respectively. amino acid sequence alignment of acr <dig> and acr <dig> shows that the n-terminal regions of these two proteins are not highly conserved. beyond the n-terminal regions, the amino acid sequences in acr <dig>  and acr <dig> , share 63% identity and 82% similarity . several computer programs including psort  and targetp  predicted that the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins are localized to the chloroplast. most nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins contain n-terminal transit peptide sequences that facilitate the transfer of these proteins from the cytoplasm to the chloroplast. the transit peptides will be cleaved after the precursor proteins are imported into chloroplasts. in acr <dig> and acr <dig>  the less conserved n-terminal sequences may function as transit peptides to target these proteins to the chloroplast. indeed, the computer program chlorop  predicts the presence of transit peptides in both proteins, and the locations of potential transit peptide cleavage sites are between the 52arg-53leu of acr <dig>  and the 32pro-33ala of acr <dig>  respectively .

protein blast analyses revealed that acr <dig> and acr <dig> are most similar to the act domains of bacterial pii-uridylyltransferase  in addition to their homologs in photosynthetic organisms . we aligned the act domains from arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr <dig> with the two act domains from e. coli glnd and the act consensus sequence from pfam <dig>  the structure of the act consensus sequence is predicted to form a βαββαβ fold, which is in accordance with the archetypical structure of the act domain of e. coli pgdh  <cit> . in addition, the initial identification and alignment of act domains uncovered a nearly invariant gly residue at the turn between the first β strand and the first α helix that coincided with the binding site for ser in e. coli pgdh  <cit> . the alignment of act domains from acr <dig>  acr <dig> and glnd indicated that these sequences are highly conserved in the β1-α <dig> loop region . moreover, the invariant gly residue is also present in the act domains of arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr <dig> .

the acr11- and acr12-gfp are localized to the chloroplast
we used green fluorescent fusion protein  and protoplast transient expression assay to examine the subcellular localization of acr <dig> and acr <dig>  the full-length acr <dig> and the first  <dig> amino acids of acr <dig> were fused to the n-terminus of a gfp. the resulting acr11- and acr12-gfp fusion constructs driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter were transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts. confocal microscopy was used to observe the fluorescent signals  <dig> h after transformation. the green fluorescent signals of acr11- and acr12-gfp fusion proteins co-localized with the auto-fluorescent signals of chlorophylls in the chloroplasts . by contrast, the protoplast transformed with the empty gfp vector alone has green fluorescent signals in the cytosol and nucleus . these results suggest that the arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins are localized to the chloroplast.

coexpression gene networks of arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr12
the functions of arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr <dig> are completely unknown. it has been suggested that genes involved in related biological pathways are often expressed cooperatively  <cit> . we attempted to identify the functions of acr <dig> and acr <dig> by searching for genes that are coexpressed with acr <dig> and acr <dig>  respectively. we obtained the acr <dig> and acr <dig> coexpression gene networks from the atted-ii database   <cit> . the three genes having the highest mutual rank  with acr <dig> are at5g <dig> , at1g <dig> , and at5g <dig>  . it is intriguing to find that acr <dig> and gln <dig> have the highest mutual rank of coexpression compared with all other genes in the arabidopsis genome. by contrast, the top three genes that are coexpressed with acr <dig> are at3g <dig> , at1g <dig> , and at1g <dig>  . the expression of acr <dig> is not co-ordinately regulated with acr <dig> and gln <dig> in the atted-ii database.

the expression of acr <dig> and gln <dig> is up-regulated by light and sucrose
we used rna gel blot analysis to examine the expression patterns of acr <dig> and gln <dig> in different organs from 6-week-old arabidopsis plants. steady-state levels of acr <dig> and gln <dig> mrnas are low in roots compared to those of leaves, stems, and flowers . it is well known that the expression of arabidopsis gln <dig> is regulated by light and sucrose  <cit> . we used rna gel blot analysis to examine the effects of light and sucrose on the expression of acr <dig> and gln <dig> . two weeks old arabidopsis seedlings grown on a  <dig> h light/ <dig> h dark cycle were transferred to media containing 0% sucrose, 3% sucrose or 3% manitol, and dark-adapted or grown in continuous light for  <dig> h. total rna extracted from these samples was used for rna gel blot analysis. in dark-adapted seedlings, steady-state levels of acr <dig> and gln <dig> mrnas are slightly increased by 3% sucrose treatment. this sucrose effect is not related to an osmotic change, because the addition of 3% mannitol does not increase the accumulation of acr <dig> and gln <dig> transcripts. by contrast, steady-state levels of acr <dig> and gln <dig> mrnas are significantly increased by the light treatment, regardless of the amounts of sucrose or mannitol in the media. the expression patterns of acr <dig> and gln <dig> are almost identical under these treatments. these results confirm that the acr <dig> and gln <dig> genes are expressed cooperatively under various conditions.

acr <dig> promoter-gus activity
to further examine the cell type and tissue specific expression of the acr <dig> gene, we fused the putative promoter of acr <dig> to a β-glucuronidase reporter gene  and generated stable arabidopsis transgenic lines. the acr11p-gus activity was detected in the cotyledons of 3-, 5- and 7-day-old seedlings . interestingly, the acr11p-gus activity was not detected in emerging young leaves and the basal part of maturing leaves, which are mainly composed of dividing and growing young cells . in developing or mature flowers, the acr11p-gus activity was detected in sepals as a gradient from the apical part  to the basal part  . in mature flowers, the acr11p-gus activity was also detected in the style . in mature siliques, the acr11p-gus activity was detected in the tip of the pedicel .

discussion
three distinct groups of acr proteins in arabidopsis
we previously reported the identification and characterization of eight act domain repeat proteins in arabidopsis and named these proteins acr <dig> to acr <dig>  respectively  <cit> . these acr proteins each contain four copies of the act domain. here, we describe four additional act domain-containing proteins in arabidopsis. except in the regions of the act domain, the amino acid sequences of these novel act domain-containing proteins are not similar to the originally identified acr proteins. however, they also contain multiple copies of the act domain. we thus adopted the term "act domain repeats " and named these proteins acr <dig> to acr <dig>  respectively.

amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis clearly divided these acr proteins into three different groups. the originally identified acr <dig> to acr <dig> proteins contain four copies of the act domain and belong to group i. the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins have three copies of the act domain, which are classified as group ii acr proteins. the amino acid sequences of acr <dig> and acr <dig> are very similar throughout the entire polypeptides. moreover, the gene structures of acr <dig> and acr <dig> are almost identical , which suggests that these two genes are recently duplicated in the arabidopsis genome during evolution. by contrast, group iii acr proteins, including acr <dig> and acr <dig>  contain two copies of the act domain. the gene structures of acr <dig> and acr <dig> are similar. however, the encoded amino acid sequences are not conserved in the n-terminal regions. the rest of the amino acid sequences, e.g. residues  <dig> to  <dig> of acr <dig>  and residues  <dig> to  <dig> of acr <dig>  are highly conserved. the non-conserved n-terminal amino acid sequences of acr <dig> and acr <dig> are predicted to be transit peptides, which target these proteins to the chloroplast. thus group iii acr proteins may be localized to the chloroplast.

group iii acr proteins are localized to the chloroplast
most amino acids are synthesized in the chloroplast. it is expected that some regulatory proteins involved in amino acid metabolism or signaling may also exist in the chloroplast. the arabidopsis group iii acr proteins are good candidates in this regard, because they are predicted to target to the chloroplast. we used transient expression assay in arabidopsis protoplasts to verify that the acr11- and acr12-gfp fusion proteins are localized to the chloroplast . after the removal of transit peptide, the mature acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins are only composed of two act domains. it is conceivable that the act domains of the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins may serve as amino acid binding domains. upon binding to specific amino acids, the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins may regulate the activities of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes in the chloroplast. alternatively, the two act domains of the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins may function as specific amino acid sensors in the chloroplast, which are similar to those of bacterial glnd proteins. it will be interesting to further characterize the functions of the arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins and their homologs in the other plants.

acr <dig> and gln <dig> are in the same coexpressed gene network
genes involved in related biological pathways are often coordinately regulated  <cit> . the coexpression analysis obtained from the atted-ii database  may help us to identify the functions of arabidopsis acr <dig> and acr <dig>  in the atted-ii database, the acr <dig> and acr <dig> genes have distinct coexpressed gene networks . it is possible that the proteins encoded by these two homologous genes may also have distinct functions in arabidopsis chloroplasts. it is intriguing that the arabidopsis acr <dig> and gln <dig> are in the same coexpressed gene network. moreover, the mutual rank for coexpression of these two genes is the highest in their respective gene networks . it is well known that the expression of arabidopsis gln <dig> is regulated by light and sugars  <cit> . we used rna gel blot analysis to examine the effects of light and sucrose on the expression of acr <dig>  interestingly, the results are in accordance with the coexpression analysis in the database. steady-state levels of both acr <dig> and gln <dig> mrnas are increased by treatments of sucrose and light . the highly cooperative expression of acr <dig> and gln <dig> observed in our experiments and in the database suggests that these two genes may belong to the same functional module. the gln <dig> encodes a chloroplastic gs <dig>  which is the major enzyme for glutamine synthesis in the chloroplast. however, the functions of the chloroplast-localized acr <dig> protein are completely unknown. the acr <dig> and gln <dig> genes have the highest coexpression relationship in the arabidopsis genome suggests that the acr <dig> protein may have functions related to gs <dig> 

the relationship between arabidopsis acr <dig> and gs <dig> is reminiscent of the pii-glnd system in the regulation of glna gene expression and gs enzyme activity in bacteria  <cit> . in addition to the acr homologs in plants, the amino acid sequence of acr <dig> is most similar to the act domains of the bacterial sensor protein glnd . thus the acr <dig>  was annotated as uridylyltransferase-related protein in the genbank . the bacterial glnd protein may sense the availability of glutamine, possibly via the two act domains in the c-terminal region, to regulate gs enzyme activity and its gene expression  <cit> . it is possible that the arabidopsis acr <dig> protein may also use its act domains to sense the availability of glutamine in the chloroplast, and then regulates gs <dig> activity or glutamine metabolism.

acr <dig> and acr <dig>  putative amino acid sensor proteins in the chloroplast
chloroplast is the site of active primary and secondary nitrogen assimilation inside a plant cell. the assimilation of ammonia into glutamine is the major pathway to convert inorganic nitrogen into organic nitrogen in plants. thus it is expected that plants may have a mechanism to sense the availability of glutamine inside the chloroplast. in e. coli, glutamine may serve as a signaling molecule to affect the expression of nitrogen assimilatory genes and the activities of nitrogen metabolic enzymes  <cit> . the two act domains located in the c-terminal region of the glnd protein are considered as glutamine sensors in bacteria  <cit> . little is known about amino acid sensing and signaling in plants. interestingly, the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins are composed of two act domains, and are localized to the chloroplast. it is conceivable that the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins may function as amino acid sensors in arabidopsis. future studies are needed to determine the functions of these chloroplastic acr proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
although the act domains have high sequence divergence, there is a common regulatory theme among these domains. the arabidopsis acr proteins contain multiple copies of the act domain and their functions are largely unknown. in this study, we identified two new groups of acr proteins in arabidopsis. group ii acr proteins, acr <dig> and acr <dig>  have three copies of the act domain. whereas group iii acr proteins, acr <dig> and acr <dig>  contain two copies of the act domain, and are localized to the chloroplast. the activities of acr <dig> promoter-gus are mainly detected in mature leaves. moreover, the expression of acr <dig> and gln <dig> is highly coordinated. the acr <dig> may function as a regulatory protein involved in glutamine metabolism or sensing in arabidopsis.
