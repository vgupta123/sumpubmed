BACKGROUND
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  is a gram-negative enteric pathogen  <cit> , and an important cause of diarrhoea in human and animals  <cit> . as the most common bacterial enteric pathogen of human in the developing world  <cit> , etec was thought to account for approximately  <dig> million diarrhoea episodes and  <dig>  deaths annually reported by who in  <dig>  therefore, the subject of etec in farm animals has always attracted much interest because it can be related to human diseases in many aspects  <cit> . furthermore, etec-associated diarrhoea results in morbidity and mortality in neonatal and recently weaned piglets and is considered as one of the economically most important diseases in swine husbandry  <cit> .

etec express long, proteinaceous appendages or fimbriae on their surface, which mediate adhesion to the gut epithelium  <cit> . the virulence characteristics of etec are strongly dependent on the production of adhesins  and enterotoxins  <cit> . porcine etec strains isolated from diarrheic pigs express  <dig> different fimbriae, of which f <dig> and f <dig> fimbriae are the most prevalent  <cit> . f <dig> fimbriae are typically associated with diarrhoea in neonatal pigs as well as in postweaning pigs  <cit>  and include f4ab, f4ac, and f4ad fimbrial variants, of which the f4ac variant is the most common type  <cit> . f <dig> fimbriae are typically associated with diarrhoea and edema disease of weaned pigs  <cit> . the f <dig> fimbriae show a characteristic zigzag pattern and occur in two antigenic variants, f18ab and f18ac, of which f18ac is more readily expressed in vitro <cit> .

the porcine ipec-j <dig> cell line, a non-transformed intestinal cell line originally derived from jejunal epithelia  <cit> , provides a biologically relevant in vitro model system for studying etec-porcine intestinal epithelial cell interactions  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that both f <dig> positive etec and purified f <dig> fimbriae could bind to ipec-j <dig> cells  <cit> , whereas ipec-j <dig> cells did not bind strain  <dig>  <cit>  nor internalize strain 107/ <dig> fimbriae  <cit>  of f <dig> 

studies to date on etec- porcine intestinal epithelial cell interactions are mostly focused on searching the fimbriae-specific receptor locus . ipec-j <dig> cells are known to express cytokines and chemokines after bacterial stimulation by quantitative real-time rt-pcr  <cit> . high-throughput microarray technology allows analysis of global changes of the expression patterns in the host cells during pathogenic bacteria infection at a given time point under uniform experimental condition  <cit>  and thus has been employed particularly for screening genes involved in disease processes or responses to pathogenic bacteria infection. healthy individuals served as controls in these previous experiments, and then up- and down-regulated genes are identified in the case samples. to avoid the variation of gene expression at the individual levels influenced by age, sex, and individual variability  <cit> , here we used ipec-j <dig> cells to profile the host transcriptional changes upon infection with three different etec strains . the objectives of our study were two points:  to identify differentially expressed genes in ipec-j <dig> cells between those infected and non-infected with each etec strain, and  to evaluate the differences of gene expressions in the infected cells among the three infection treatments with each etec strain separately.

RESULTS
temporal gene expression profiles of etec infected ipec-j <dig> cells
as etec f4ab, f4ac and etec f18ac are three important etec variants causing severe diarrhoea in newborn and/or weaned pigs  <cit> , we paid special attention to their respective and common influences on ipec-j <dig> cells. the numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes identified using agilent porcine oligo microarray  are shown in table  <dig> 

* cf4ab, ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f4ab etec; cf4ac, ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f4ac etec; cf18ac, ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f18ac etec; control: the non-infected ipec-j <dig> cells. #↑: up-regulated in etec infected cells versus control or more highly expressed in the cells infected with different etec strains; ↓: down-regulated in etec infected cells versus control or more lowly expressed in the cells infected with different etec strains.

identification of differentially expressed genes following each etec strain infection
initially, we compared the gene expression profiles of cf4ab and control. under the criteria of p <  <dig>  and |fc | >  <dig> , the comparison of cf4abvs control showed  <dig>  transcripts, representing  <dig>  unique genes, were significantly differentially expressed with false discovery rate  <  <dig>  . of the  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. furthermore, among the up-regulated transcripts,  <dig>   had a fc >  <dig> and  <dig>  had a fc >  <dig>  among the down-regulated transcripts,  <dig>   had a fc >  <dig> and  <dig>  had a fc >  <dig> 

likewise, the numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes resulted from comparing cf4acvs control and cf18acvs control are also summarized in table  <dig>  the results in table  <dig> illustrated that the most differentially expressed genes were detected in f4ac etec infected cells, while the least were observed in cf18ac.

identification of differentially expressed genes of ipec-j <dig> cells infected with different etec strains
comparison of the gene expression profiles of cf4ab to cf4ac revealed  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, comprising  <dig> unique genes, with criteria of p <  <dig> , |fc| >  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig>  . of the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig>  were more highly expressed in cf4ac and  <dig>  were more highly expressed in cf4ab. of the more highly expressed transcripts in cf4ac,  <dig>  had a fc >  <dig> and two  had a fc >  <dig>  of the more highly expressed transcripts in cf4ab,  <dig>  had a fc >  <dig> and no transcript was with fc >  <dig> 

the results of the comparisons of cf4abvs cf18ac and cf4acvs cf18ac are also listed in table  <dig>  for the differentially expressed genes between ipec-j <dig> cells infected with different etec strains, cf4acvs cf18ac had the most differentially expressed genes, while cf4abvs cf4ac had the least.

the commonly differentially expressed genes in all of the three comparison pairs  as well as in any two pairs are shown in figure  <dig>  there were a total of  <dig> commonly differentially expressed genes in all of the three comparison pairs, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated with consistent expression direction, and four with opposite expression direction. the pairs of cf4abvs control and cf4acvs control shared the most commonly differentially expressed genes, up to  <dig> , suggesting the f4ab and f4ac etec infections caused more similar response in the ipec-j <dig> cells.

functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes
functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes , including the gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis, was performed using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  bioinformatics resources   <cit> . three categories are included in go: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. due to significant relevance of biological processes, we only presented functional clusters belonging to this category as well as the relevant pathways.

characterization of the functional analysis of differentially expressed genes between infected and non-infected cells
for the  <dig> unique genes observed in the comparison of cf4abvs control,  <dig> enriched go terms and six pathways  were obtained from the up-regulated genes, while six enriched go terms and five pathways  were obtained from the down-regulated genes. the enriched go terms of the up-regulated genes could be roughly grouped into two clusters. the first cluster is cell cycle progression  <cit>  . the second cluster centers on catabolism processes, such as cellular amino acid catabolic process and amine catabolic process. among the six pathways, the p <dig> signaling pathway, which can be induced by a number of stress signals such as pathogen infection, oxidative stress, dna damage and activated oncogenes, has the ability to eliminate excess, damaged or infected cells by apoptosis  <cit> . another pathway, the systemic lupus erythematosus pathway, points to that pathogens gain their foothold in host cells through modulating host defense mechanisms  <cit> . these two pathways had the lowest p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. the remaining four pathways are cell cycle, bladder cancer, arachidonic acid metabolism and homologous recombination, and the pathway of cell cycle is related with the p <dig> signaling pathway.

as shown in figure 2b and additional file  <dig>  for the down-regulated genes induced by f4ab etec infection, six enriched go terms were significantly enriched. these included cell projection organization, ribonucleotide metabolic process, ribonucleotide biosynthetic process, and microtubule-based process. the significantly enriched five pathways were ecm-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, mapk signaling pathway, prostate cancer, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis.

for the comparison of cf4acvs control, nineteen enriched go terms and seven pathways  were found in the up-regulated genes. these functional terms could be roughly grouped into five clusters:  cell cycle progression, which is similar to the first go term cluster of cf4abvs control, including m phase of mitotic cell cycle, cell division, chromatin organization, dna metabolic process, dna packaging, mitosis, mitotic cell cycle, nuclear division, organelle fission, protein-dna complex assembly, chromatin assembly or disassembly, nucleosome organization, nucleosome assembly, and chromatin assembly;  immune response and inflammatory response;  response to wounding;  apoptosis and programmed cell death;  proteolysis. the significantly enriched pathways are shown in figure 2a. for the down-regulated genes, the enrichment go terms and pathways are shown in figure 2b .

for the comparison of cf18acvs control, nine enriched go terms and one pathway  were observed from the up-regulated genes only. the enriched go terms could be roughly grouped into two clusters. the first cluster is cell cycle progression too, including m phase of mitotic cell cycle, chromatin organization, mitosis, nuclear division, organelle fission, chromatin assembly or disassembly, chromatin organization and mitotic cell cycle. the second cluster is immune response. the only pathway detected to be expressed was systemic lupus erythematosus.

characterization of the functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes between cells infected with different etecs
since the cf4ab and cf4ac had similar expression patterns, only  <dig> differentially expressed genes between them were observed . six significantly enriched go terms and one pathway were only obtained from the genes more lowly expressed in cf4ab . the six go terms include immune response, chemotaxis, taxis, locomotory behavior, defense response, and behavior. the only pathway detected to be expressed was chemokine signaling pathway containing four genes.

by comparing the cf4ab and cf18ac, for the genes with higher expression in cf4ab, four enriched go terms , and three pathways  were observed . for the genes with higher expression in cf18ac, three enriched go terms  and three pathways  were significantly enriched .

the comparison of cf4acvs cf18ac revealed that sixteen enriched go terms and nine pathways were enriched from the genes with higher expression in cf4ac , while two go terms and three pathways were enriched from lower expression genes in cf18ac .

identification of immune-related genes response to etecs infection
due to the pathogenicity of etecs to the ipec-j <dig> cells, immune-related genes are biologically important for the host response to the antigens  <cit> . based on the results of david  annotation tools, the postulated immune-related genes and gene products identified in this study are as follows.

differentially expressed immune-related genes between the cells infected and non-infected with etecs
the significantly differentially expressed immune/disease related genes between cells with and without etec infection are showed in figure 1d. of the  <dig> differentially expressed unique genes in the comparison of cf4abvs control,  <dig> genes  are immune-related . the highest fold-change  was observed for the inflammatory response protein  <dig>  gene, while the low affinity immunoglobulin gamma fc region receptor ii-b  gene was the most down-regulated gene with a fold-change of  <dig> .

for the comparison of cf4acvs control,  <dig> out of the  <dig> differentially expressed unique genes are immune-related genes , including  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes. the highest fold-change  was observed for the chemokine  ligand  <dig>  gene, while the tenascin c  gene was the most down-regulated gene with a fold-change of  <dig> .

for the comparison of cf18acvs control,  <dig> up-regulated and one down-regulated genes  are immune-related genes . the highest fold-change  was observed for the ak <dig>  gene which belongs to the viral myocarditis pathway, whereas the cd <dig>  was the only down-regulated gene with a fold-change of  <dig> .

differentially expressed immune-related genes between cells infected with different etec strains
due to the differences in virulence of etecs to the ipec-j <dig> cells, it is expected that some immune-related genes would be differently expressed upon three etecs infection.

in the comparison of cf4acvs cf4ab,  <dig> unique genes  were observed, of which six  are immune-related genes. all of the six genes were more highly expressed in cf4ac than in cf4ab and three of them  were up-regulated in both cf4ab and cf4ac compared to control, while the other three  were only up-regulated in cf4ac compared to control.

in the comparison of cf18acvs cf4ac,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> differentially expressed unique genes are immune-related, of which  <dig> and  <dig> were more highly expressed in cf18ac and cf4ac, respectively. of the more highly expressed genes in cf18ac, defensin-beta  <dig> gene  was found to be with the highest fold-change , while interleukin  <dig>  was the most highly expressed gene in cf4ac with a fold-change of  <dig> .

for the comparison of cf18acvs cf4ab,  <dig>  out of the  <dig> differentially expressed unique genes are immune-related genes, which contained  <dig> and  <dig> more highly expressed genes in cf18ac and cf4ab, respectively. of the more highly expressed genes in cf18ac, the highest fold-change  was observed for ak <dig>  which belongs to the systemic lupus erythematosus pathway, while interleukin  <dig>  was the most highly expressed genes in cf4ab with a fold-change of  <dig> .

validation of the microarray results by real-time quantitative rt-pcr
to validate the microarray results by quantitative rt-pcr , we designed primers  for four up-regulated , four down-regulated  and two unchanged   genes from the three comparisons of cf4abvs control, cf4acvs control and cf18acvs control. in addition, muc <dig> was also validated using the primers reported by sargeant et al. <cit> . two commonly used reference genes, i.e.gapdh <cit>  and actb, were used in the validation. the primers were designed to span introns to avoid the influence of dna contamination. as shown in table  <dig>  the expression profiles of these genes detected by qrt-pcr were consistent with those by microarray, which confirmed the reliability of our microarray data.

* cf4ab, ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f4ab etec; cf4ac, ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f4ac etec ; cf18ac, ipec-j <dig> cells infected with f18ac etec ; control: the non-infected ipec-j <dig> cells. # g: gene expression level related to gapdh; a: gene expression level related to actb. the numbers here represent the fold change of gene expression after etec infection. the numbers equal to  <dig>  means the expression level doesn’t change after etec infection. the numbers >  <dig>  means the expression level is increased after etec infection while numbers <  <dig>  indicate that the expression level is reduced after etec infection. the numbers with “*” are statistically significant , and which with“**” are statistically very significant .

discussion
in the present study, genome-wide gene expression profiles of porcine ipec-j <dig> cells infected by three etec strains  separately was studied using agilent porcine oligo microarray . differences of gene expression profiles between cells with and without infection as well as among cells infected with different etec strains separately were presented. to our knowledge, this is the first report about the remarked differential responses of porcine iec cells to the infections of the three etec strains.

after infection with f4ab, f4ac and f18ac etec separately,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in the ipec-j <dig> cells, respectively. gene ontology analysis of these three groups of genes revealed that they shared six biological process terms, of which five are involved in the cell-cycle progression. this indicated that the infections of the three etec strains all affected cell-cycle progression through bacterial toxins  <cit>  or cyclomodulins  <cit> . the genes induced by f4ab etec and f4ac etec shared the most biological process terms and pathways, which was consistent with the similarity of the antigenic structures of f4ab and f4ac fimbrial antigen. both of them have the “a” epitopes formed by the conserved region of the major f <dig> fimbrial subunit faeg   <cit> . however, they also have their own specific go terms. the specific go terms of the f4ab etec induced genes are associated with catabolic processes, whereas those of the f4ac etec induced genes are associated with immune response, inflammatory response and response to wounding, and apoptosis. these results implied why f4ac is the most common antigenic variant of f <dig> fimbriae causing piglet diarrhoea  <cit> .

differentially expressed genes induced by etecs are involved in some important pathways. one of the main canonical pathways clustered by the down-regulated genes induced by f4ab etec is ecm-receptor interaction , which affects cell migration  <cit>  and mediates cell communication with the extracellular environments  <cit> . another important pathway is the kegg mapk pathway, which is located downstream of many growth-factor receptors  <cit>  and is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli  <cit> . mapk pathway mediates cell communication with extracellular environments  <cit>  and regulates a broad array of biological processes, including focal adhesion  <cit>  that also controlling cell communication  <cit> . compared to f4ab etec, the ecm-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways were also obtained from the down-regulated genes induced by f4ac etec, but with four more genes in each of them . the abundance of down-regulated genes within the ecm, mapk and focal adhesion pathways, suggested that the genes enriched in them were disabled after etec infection at the transcriptional level.

the comparisons between the gene expression profiles induced by the three etec infection separately showed that the gene expression profiles induced by f4ab and f4ac etec were quite similar. more importantly, the results clearly disclosed that porcine intestinal epithelial cells infected with f4ac etec exhibited the highest level of differential gene expression, whereas f18ac etec infected cells had a substantially smaller number of genes which were differentially expressed. cells infected with f4ab etec exhibited intermediate effects on gene expression. these results revealed that f <dig> etec infection displayed acute effects on ipec-j <dig> cells, while the infection effects of f18ac etec were milder, which accorded with their different infection effect in vivo <cit> .

intestinal epithelial cells  are pivotal for the activation of innate immunity and subsequently for the induction of adaptive immune responses  <cit> . we found numerous important immune-related genes were differentially expressed upon separate infection with each of the three etec strains . similar to that described in the reports of mitterhuemer et al. and jenner et al. <cit> , we could also integrate our findings into a scheme to describe the transcriptional response of ipec-j <dig> to etecs infections , which clearly interprets the pathogen-host interaction of etecs and ipec-j <dig> cells after  <dig> h co-culture. consistent with earlier findings, we observed f <dig> etecs  could significantly enhance the expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokine  <cit> , while f18ac etec could only enhance the expression of il- <dig>  which confirmed the principal idea that apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells represent a mechanical barrier against pathogens firstly  <cit> .

in addition, upon f4ac etec infection we also observed up-regulation of a range of important pro-inflammatory transcripts including tnf , ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  lif, il1a, csf <dig> , csf <dig> , and il12a, whereas some of them  were not significantly enhanced by f4ab etec infection and only il12a, cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> were significantly up-regulated by f18ac etec .

mammalian toll like receptors  are members of the pattern recognition receptor  family that plays a central role in the initiation of innate cellular immune responses and the subsequent adaptive immune responses to microbial pathogens  <cit> . two tlrs, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  were both observed to be expressed differentially upon separate infection with f4ab and f4ac etec, while no tlrs expressed differentially after f18ac etec infection. tlr <dig>  which acts as the lipopolysaccharide  receptor  <cit> , is implicated in the mediation of inflammatory response to gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . it is worth to note that in our present study both f4ab and f4ac infections down-regulated the tlr <dig> mrna expression. the possible reasons are as follows:  some bioactive molecules like vasoactive intestinal peptide  could depress the active effects of lps and tnf-α on tlr <dig> expression  <cit> . the expression of the receptor of vip, the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor  <dig> , was both up-regulated after f4ab and f4ac etec separate infection, leading to a down-regulated expression of tlr <dig>   to maintain the homeostasis of the ipec-j <dig> cells, some epigenetic mechanisms, like histone deacetylation and dna methylation, down-regulated the expression of tlr <dig> <cit> . on the other hand, tlr <dig>  which recognizes unmethylated cytidine-phosphate-guanosine dna motifs  <cit> , was both over-expressed in the ipec-j <dig> cells separately infected with f4ab and f4ac etec.

greens et al. <cit>  found  <dig> genes differentially expressed between ipec-j <dig> cells cocultured with f <dig> etec  for  <dig> h and ipec-j <dig> cells at  <dig> h using porcine genome array , at a multiplicity of infection of  <dig> bacteria to  <dig> ipec-j <dig> cells. they also demonstrated up-regulation of a range of innate immune response genes including il-8cxcl <dig> il1a, but whose fold changes were far smaller than those here. the most obvious differences between the two studies are the numbers and the magnitude of fold changes of differentially expressed genes induced by etecs infections. in the current study, after infection with f4ab, f4ac and f18ac etec separately,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified in the ipec-j <dig> cells, respectively. it is likely that the main cause for the differences between this study and that of geens et al <cit>  is the moi  used as well as differences in etec strains. niewold et al. <cit>  used cdna arrays to investigate the genomic impact of etec k <dig> on jejunal segments in four piglets, and showed significant differential regulation of on average fifteen transcripts in mucosa, with considerable individual variation. interestingly, niewold et al. found the common expression for a limited number of genes including papmmp- <dig>  and stat <dig> at  <dig> h post-infection. since stat <dig> in epithelial cells mediates mucosa-protective and anti-inflammatory functions  <cit> , and mmp- <dig> is one number of pro-inflammatory mmps   <cit> , it is evident that the final outcome of inflammatory response depends on a balance between anti-inflammatory stat <dig> and pro-inflammatory mmp- <dig>  this indicates one more time point of jejunal segments in piglets infused with etec is warrant.

from the results here and comparable studies, it is clear that etec stimulates a typical inflammatory response in porcine intestinal cells, the extent of which is different according to the different etec strain, moi and infection time.

as mentioned above, more immune-related genes which respond to f4ac etec or f4ab etec infection were detected in ipec-j <dig> cells than those respond to f18ac etec infection . it is probably due to the following reasons:  compared to f18ac etec, the serotypes and virulence genes of f4ab and f4ac etec are more similar .  adhesion ability of the three etecs is different. at the same time point , the f4ac etec was the most adhesive strain, followed by f4ab etec with a little bit lower adhesion value , whereas f18ac etec showed the lowest adhesion pattern compared to f4ac etec  and f4ab etec . it has been reported that, in contrast to f4ac etec , f18ac etec  has a slower colonization to the gut in vivo <cit>  and it does not adhere to ipec-j <dig> cells  <cit>  nor be internalized by ipec-j <dig> cells in vitro <cit> .

many reports have focused on the receptor genes of etec f <dig> and f <dig>  since they cause severe diarrhoea and edema disease in piglets  <cit> . for etec f <dig>  the two variants f18ab and f18ac are considered to recognize the same receptor  <cit>  and fut <dig> is reported as the causative gene for f <dig> susceptibility  <cit> . up to now, a group of investigators have been searching for the etec f4ab/f4ac receptor gene   <cit> . the acknowledged possible candidate genes include: muc <dig> <cit> , muc <dig> <cit>  and muc <dig> <cit> , and the latest inferred interval where the receptor gene is located is between the lmln locus and microsatellite s <dig>  <cit> . in this study, the infection with f4ab etec slightly down-regulated the mrna levels of fut <dig>  and muc <dig>  in the ipec-j <dig> cells, while in the f4ac etec infected ipec-j <dig> cells, the down-regulated genes included: fut <dig> , muc <dig> , muc <dig>  and muc <dig> . although the mechanism about how etecs infections cause down-regulation of the above genes in the ipec-j <dig> cell line is not clear, the highly and constitutively expressed cell-surface mucin muc <dig> were reported to protect against intestinal inflammation in mice  <cit> . we therefore suppose that intense inflammation in intestine/iec may disturb the expression of these mucin genes and further study in different time point with different moi of etec is warrant.

CONCLUSIONS
gene expression profiles of the ipec-j <dig> cells with and without f4ab, f4ac or f18ac etec infection were evaluated and compared. this transcriptome approach allowed us to obtain a global overview of genes and their different functional entities involved in response to separate infection with f4ab, f4ac and f18ac etec specifically and/ or commonly. in summary, strong differential host responses to these three etec infections were observed. f18ac etec infection positively modulated the cell cycle progression and immune response of ipec-j <dig> cells. f4ab etec infection caused a dramatic up-regulation of genes in cell cycle progression and amino acid metabolism and a large number of changes in host immune defences. for the f4ac etec infection, the responses of the host cells were characterized by great up-regulations on immune, wounding and inflammatory response. the findings herein provided a solid proof why etec with f <dig> may be more virulent compared to f <dig> which seems to elicit milder effects, which further characterized and defined the genetic mechanisms of responses to different etec colonization and adhesion in small intestine of piglets.

materials and methods
cell culture
the ipec-j <dig> cell line was grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium /ham’s f- <dig>  medium  supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum  and was maintained in a 95% air-5% co <dig> humidified atmosphere at 37°c  <cit> , which were free of mycoplasma contamination.

bacterial strains
f4ab etec strain  <dig>  and f4ac etec strain  <dig>   were removed from cryo-storage and cultured in ordinary broth agar at 37°c for three generations   <cit> . etec strain  <dig>   was cultured in static tryptone soya agar  medium at 37°c for  <dig> h, and then in static tryptone soya broth  medium at 37°c for two generations  <cit> . for cell infection experiment, the e. coli strains were subcultured in shaking  lb and tsb medium, respectively, at 37°c for  <dig> h, then centrifuged and washed with sterile pbs . finally the bacterial suspension  was prepared in pbs.

infection of the cell lines
monolayers of cells prepared in 24-well tissue culture plates  were washed twice with pbs, then  <dig>  ml of dmem was added. a total of 20ul of bacterial suspension  was used for infection or the same volume of pbs as control. the cells were incubated at 37°c in a 95% air- 5% co <dig> air atmosphere for  <dig> h  <cit> . the adhesion values of the etec strains to ipec-j <dig> cells were checked by real-time pcr with slightly modified procedures described by candela et al. <cit>  . twelve samples were prepared including nine with the three etec strains infection treatments  and three samples as control.

total rna isolation
ipec-j <dig> cells  infected with and without e. coli strains were washed twice with pbs, then lysed with trizol reagent  directly in the culture dishes. isolation of rna was performed using trizol reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions and checked for a rin number to inspect the rna integration by an agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> . qualified total rna was further purified by rneasy micro kit  and rnase-free dnase set .

sample labeling and hybridization
total rna was amplified and labelled by low input quick amp labeling kit, one-color , following the manufacturer’s instructions. the labeled crna was purified by rneasy mini kit , then used for hybridization onto porcine oligo microarray slides  containing  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes at 65°c for  <dig> h. the hybridized microarray slides were washed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were scanned by agilent microarray scanner  at 5-mm resolution. raw data were normalized by quantile algorithm, gene spring software  <dig>  .

microarray data analysis
the normalized data were analyzed using genespring software version  <dig>   to screen differently expressed genes. gene ontology and pathway analysis for the differentially expressed genes were performed through the david v <dig>  software  <cit> .

focus was particularly laid on the variation of the gene expressions profiles related to different e. coli strain infections. initially, microarray spots of interest were divided into three groups: “absent”, “marginal” and “present”, using the flag values given by the scanner, which was similar to that described by junko et al. <cit> . background level was determined from the spots outside the gene probing area. “absent” was assigned to the spots whose signal intensity was not significantly different from the background level. “present” was assigned to the spots with significantly different signal intensity from the background level. the rest were marked as “marginal”, whose situation were intermediated between “absent” and “present’. the threshold of a differently expressed gene was that in one group of three biology repeats at least one was not “absent” in addition to considering fc and p-value.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
the first-strand cdna synthesis was performed using  <dig> μg of total rna by superscripttm ii reverse transcriptase  with oligo  12– <dig> primers . the cdna samples were then analyzed with real time rt-pcr using a lightcycler®  <dig> real-time pcr system . the real time rt-pcr reactions were performed in a final volume of  <dig> μl with the roche sybr green pcr kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the pig genes actb and gapdh were used as the internal standards to correct the input of cdna. triplicate qrt-pcrs were performed on each cdna and the average ct was used for further analysis. the relative quantification values were calculated using the 2-ΔΔct.
