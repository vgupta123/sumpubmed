BACKGROUND
in the last two decades, the advent of molecular markers and their use in linkage mapping experiments has tremendously increased the potential of quantitative genetics. linkage mapping experiments now provide an efficient tool to identify regions of the genome where polymorphism affects the variation of quantitative traits, called quantitative trait loci . although a large number of advanced statistical methods have been developed to improve the localization of qtl, the limited number of recombination events available in routinely used pedigree designs for qtl mapping lead essentially to an approximate mapping of the qtl . this is mainly due to both a few mating generations and a restricted number of sampled individuals . from results of qtl experiments gathered over a wide range of plant species,  <cit>  have shown that confidence intervals around most likely qtl positions are, on average, approximately  <dig> cm, which usually includes several hundreds of genes. more recent advents in the area of molecular biology have allowed researchers to carry out positional cloning of qtl  but this approach still remains extremely expensive both in terms of time and resources. also several authors  <cit>  have pointed out that qtl detection is statistically biased both in the true number of qtl, which is underestimated since only qtl with large effects are detected, and in the qtl effects which are over estimated as only significant effects are reported . even though qtl mapping experiments must be considered with an awareness of these limitations, they have become commonplace and have greatly improved our knowledge about the genetic component of complex traits.

since the first publication of a qtl localization using molecular data  <cit> , more and more species and traits have been studied and many of these results has been made available via public databases. one of the main purposes of these databases was to help researchers to compare results from different qtl studies, to study the congruency of qtl locations in order to address the following question: "do qtl identified for a given trait in a population correspond to those detected in other populations ?". in theory one would expect that the variation of a quantitative trait within a species is explained by a finite number of genes. thus qtl congruency investigation will be a relevant approach to improve knowledge on trait genetics and several publications have pointed out its usefulness  <cit> . nevertheless, the combination of results from linkage studies can be tedious since, even if several studies focus on the same trait within the same species, family structures, sample sizes, marker maps, or qtl detection methods may differ between studies. some methods have been recently developed to tackle the issues raised by between qtl studies heterogeneity. integration of genetic maps and qtl locations by iterative projections on a reference map is now widely used to position both markers and qtl on a single and homogeneous consensus map . however this process yields a consensus marker map for which both the statistical properties and biological "reality" can't be clearly assessed, even if a robust ordered marker map was used as reference.  <cit>  proposed an original approach using graph theory to integrate various types of maps  but it mainly dealt with dissection of marker order inconsistencies between maps. from up to now it seems that there is no efficient methodological framework to build reliable consensus marker maps on which markers and candidate genes from different mapping experiments can be both ordered and positioned .

in order to study qtl congruency,  <cit>  proposed an original approach based on a meta-analysis strategy. meta-analysis, which is mainly used in medical, social, and behavioral sciences, aims to pool results across independent studies in order to combine them in a single result or estimate. the relevance of meta-analysis investigations in genetics and evolution has been discussed and pointed out by several authors in the last decade . more recently  <cit>  developed another meta-analysis based approach to overcome the between-study heterogeneity and to refine both qtl location and the magnitude of the genetic effects. yet both the method of  <cit>  and  <cit>  are limited to a small number of underlying qtl positions  which is a serious limitation for a whole genome study of qtl congruency. even if the average number of qtl per experiment is around four in plants  <cit> , one would expect that more than four genes can be involved in the trait variation on a single chromosome.

to remove these impediments we have developed a new 2-stage meta-analysis procedure in order to integrate multiple independent qtl mapping experiments. our aim was to create a global framework to evaluate the homogeneity of both genetic marker and qtl mapping results from literature and public databases. the first part of our meta-analysis procedure consists in building a consensus genetic marker map that takes into account the statistical properties of genetic distance estimates using a weighted least squares  strategy. secondly, once the consensus marker map has been built, the qtl locations can be projected on to the map. we also propose a new clustering algorithm based on a gaussian mixture model in order to identify the number of underlying qtl which best explain the observed distribution of qtl positions in the mapping experiments. as it has been emphasized by  <cit> , the crucial point at this step is to find an unbiased criterion to select the correct number of qtl. in the context of gaussian mixture, a large variety of model choice criteria have been reported in the literature. we explore, by means of simulations, the properties of some of these criteria for our particular mixture model. these new methods have been implemented into a java package called metaqtl. finally, as an example, we applied our new approach to qtl detection results gathered for flowering time in maize.

now suppose the n experiments are consistent with the following assumptions:

• assumption  <dig> : they come from independent population samples. this implies that cov =  <dig> and cov =  <dig> for any pair of markers mj and mk which have been mapped in population i and i', i ≠ i' and  ∈  <dig> .

• assumption  <dig> : there is no interference, i.e in each mapping experiment the recombination events occur independently in each marker interval. this is surely an idealization, but presently, most of the statistical models used to build genetic marker maps are based on this assumption. thus for a given mapping experiment i, both the ordered marker interval recombination rate and distance estimates are independent, i.e cov, r^

furthermore the n qtl mapping experiments are assumed to be consistent with the following assumptions:

• assumption  <dig> : for a given trait there is a finite number of underlying qtl which cosegregate in the mapping experiments: this means that the populations share the same trait determinism with potentially different allelic configurations at the qtl. in other word there is a finite number of true qtl positions on the linkage groups, i.e {xij| ∈  × } can potentially contain redundancy.

in addition to the two previous assumptions we also assume that the detected qtl locations are independent within experiments. this is not really true when the qtl detection does not properly take into account linked qtl. but with the advent of composite interval mapping strategy  <cit>  multiple-qtl model can now be fitted by adding properly chosen cofactors which limit the impact of linkage between qtl on the position estimates. therefore we assume that x^

pre-processing
the first step is to apply our wls strategy to the n mapping experiments in order to build a consensus linkage group. then the qtl locations are projected on the consensus linkage group using a simple scaling rule between the original qtl flanking marker interval and the corresponding one on the consensus chromosome. for a given qtl location the new confidence interval  on the consensus linkage group is computed by taking into account the average scaling between the original and the consensus chromosome. this is done by computing the sum over the common marker intervals of the ratio of the interval lengths weighted by the probability that the qtl position lies in this interval. there are two possible strategies to approximate this probability. the first one relies on a rough approximation using a gaussian distribution around the most likely position x^

the meta-analysis model
the purpose of the qtl meta-analysis is to evaluate, for a given trait, the degree of congruency of the qtl detected in the n mapping experiments. by assuming that there is a finite number of true qtl locations,  <cit>  proposed a clustering based approach to both classify the observed qtl and estimate the positions of the underlying qtl. their method proceeds by testing all the possible qtl combinations and then choosing the one which maximizes a penalized log-likelihood. although interesting, this method suffers from a categorical repartition of the qtl in the clusters, which is a limit case of gaussian mixture models. we propose to adopt a similar clustering strategy but with a more standard gaussian mixture model which allows qtl to be probabilistically distributed into clusters.

in order to lighten the notation we denote by q the total number of observed qtl locations and we ignore the mapping experiment subscripts so that x^

simulation study
for the sake of concision, in this section we only present simulations for the qtl meta-analysis . we assume that the complexity which shapes the distribution of the observed qtl along the chromosome can be represented by our mixture model. in order to explore mixture configurations which are realistic we have assumed that the qtl effects have a l-shaped distribution . consequently this implies that Σ- <dig>  the inverse of the qtl standard deviations, has also a l-shaped distribution . then for a given value of the number of true qtl, k, we randomly generated configurations as follows:

• eic ≈ aic - k +  <dig>  which was obtained by means of simulations .

where ν = 2k -  <dig> is the number of free parameters of the model and q the number of observed qtl along the chromosome .

in figure  <dig> we summarized the result of simulations for several values of k and q by averaging over the distance constraint configurations . at first sight the  <dig> criteria seem to have the same behavior whatever the configuration, except for aic <dig> which crucially underperforms for small values of q . for reasonable sample size relatively to the true number of components the meta-analysis appears to be more efficient than strategy  <dig>  since the aic criterion has relatively good performance in these simulations we assume that there is no need for a specific theory to deal with this kind of mixture models and that this criterion can be used to carry out model selection in this context. so, in figure  <dig> we focus on the aic criterion for the different distance configurations δmin =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this clearly shows that, for configurations with reasonable separation between the true positions of the qtl, the meta-analysis performs relatively well. it is worth noting that the better the probability to choose the true model, the better the quality of the qtl position estimates. in order to evaluate the ability of the meta-analysis to improve the precision on the "true" qtl locations we computed the quantities |xi - x^

all the criteria select the model with  <dig> qtl . the values are adjusted with respect to the minimal value of the criterion, i.e. the value for k =  <dig> .

implementation
the previous methods have been implemented into a java package called metaqtl. this package includes also additional programs to format, organize or visualize the data. all the programs in metaqtl are command line programs . each program performs a specific task and the programs can be combined by the user as a group to run a complete analysis. thanks to its flexible and modular implementation, metaqtl could also be integrated in more elaborated softwares if needed. first, before running meta-analysis one needs to store the different qtl studies into a database. to do this metaqtl uses a simple multiple plain text files database. each file corresponds to a table and the database is organized as follows:

the positions and the lengths of the ci are given in cm. the 95% ci is derived from the conditional variance estimate of the position obtained by applying the sem strategy. note that qtl  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to vgt <dig> and vgt <dig>  respectively .

• experiment file: stores descriptions on mapping experiments .

• genetic map directory : contains one file per input marker map. each file contains the corresponding genetic marker map.

• qtl map directory : contains one file per qtl mapping experiments. for each qtl mapping experiment the file provides the properties of each detected qtl .

• trait ontology file: describes how the traits are related together using a simple hierarchical relationship scheme. this information can then be used to group the qtl according to the ontology in subsequent analyses.

once the database created, metaqtl first checks the input data files and then summarizes their content into a set of xml files. all the programs of metaqtl use these xml files as inputs. utilities are provided to convert them in various plain text file formats if required .

application
recently,  <cit>  made a bibliographical review of qtl studies relative to  <dig> traits related to flowering time in maize: days to pollen shed , silking date , plant height  and leaf number . from the  <dig> qtl studies they reported, we excluded  <dig> experiments for which qtl detection was based on anova with a low density of markers and  <dig> other for which it was not possible to get exact information on either the genetic linkage map or the qtl locations. in addition to these  <dig> mapping experiments we considered  <dig> other recent experiments . we focus here on chromosome  <dig> and we present results by using for each step of the meta-analysis the corresponding program name of metaqtl.

result of infomap
among the  <dig> distinct markers which have been positioned over the  <dig> mapping experiments on the chromosome  <dig>  only  <dig> markers are observed in at least two different mapping experiments. we restricted the meta-analysis to these  <dig> markers. only one order inconsistency was detected between  <cit>  and  <cit>  concerning markers umc89a and umc12a. as in  <cit> umc12a is very close to umc89a  we have decided to ignore this marker in this mapping experiment. over the  <dig> mapping experiments the mean interval distance was about  <dig>  cm with an average of  <dig>  markers per mapping experiment and it existed at least one common marker path which connected all the mapping experiments together .

the consensus linkage group of chromosome  <dig> is depicted in figure  <dig>  the goodness-of-fit of the consensus chromosome is relatively bad: λ =  <dig>  with λ ~ χ872

result of qtlproj
from the  <dig> qtl studies we projected  <dig> qtl on the consensus chromosome  <dig>  among these  <dig> qtl,  <dig>  are related to sd,  <dig>  to dps and  <dig>  to ht. the distribution of the r-square values clearly shows a l-shape: 75% of the qtl have r-square values lower than 12%. for  <dig> qtl a ci was reported  from which we computed the standard deviations assuming that a 1-lod support corresponds in fact to a 90% ci. for the other qtl we derived the standard deviations from the formula proposed by  <cit> . then models from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig> qtl were considered and their parameters estimated by applying our em-algorithm.

result of qtlclust
in table  <dig> we give the values for the criteria aic, aicc, aic <dig> and bic for the different values of k explored. this clearly shows that the model with  <dig> qtl is the best one. then, for the model with  <dig> qtl, the parameter estimates are listed in table  <dig> and depicted in figure  <dig>  first,  <dig> qtl  have been detected in only 22% of the mapping experiments. at least two observed qtl are assigned to each of these  <dig> qtl without ambiguity.

secondly, two closely linked qtl  contribute to 75% of the reported qtl. this is strongly consistent with the knowledge of this region where a major qtl, vgt <dig>  is tightly linked to another qtl, vgt <dig>  <cit> . it is worth noting that the confidence interval of the qtl corresponding to vgt <dig>  encompasses a marker interval of approximately  <dig> cm  in which this qtl has been finely mapped by  <cit>  using nil lines . this congruency lends further credence to the meta-analysis approach.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
nowadays more and more studies concerning qtl detection are available via public databases and the number of articles dealing with the comparison and/or integration of these results increases  <cit> . we believe that our meta-analysis procedure can contribute to facilitate the elaboration of such syntheses by providing a simple statistical framework to establish consensus models for both linkage maps and qtl locations.

first, the wls strategy we proposed is a step forward to integrate several genetic marker maps. contrary to iterative projection procedures, this approach provides a well-established statistical machinery  to assess the goodness-of-fit of the consensus model. it can also be used to test the homogeneity of the distance estimates among different mapping experiments. this can be usefull to investigate the possible variation of recombination rate among genotypes . as pointed out in the application, this method can suffer from the lack of knowledge about the effective precision on the marker interval distances in each individual mapping experiment due to possible missing data and/or the type of scoring of individual markers . this could be improved by asking researchers to supply the variance estimates of the marker interval distances when they submit their results to a public database. these variance estimates could be used to improve the weight factors in the wls model. also, as sometimes robust framework maps are available in the literature or via public databases, the program consmap in metaqtl offers the possibility to fix a genetic map as a reference . in this case, only the positions of the markers which are not reported on the reference have to be estimated.

secondly, for the qtl meta-analysis itself, the gaussian mixture model used to fit the distribution of the observed qtl locations on the chromosome provides a well-studied statistical inference technique. in this model-based clustering, each "true" qtl is mathematically represented by the gaussian distribution of its detected positions, which leads to a probabilistic classification of the observed qtl. contrary to  <cit>  who developed a specific model choice criterion, our simulation results show that aic gives relatively good performances in our qtl meta-analysis framework. this difference, with regard to the conclusions of  <cit> , may be explained by their discrete formulation of the problem . parameter estimates obtained by this approach were not really the maximum-likelihood estimates of the underlying mixture model. this may have added a bias in the evaluation of the aic criterion, which could explain the bad performances of aic in their simulations.

thus, our mixture-modelling approach makes it possible to go beyond the limits encountered by  <cit> : the akaike like criterion they proposed was limited to models from  <dig> to  <dig> qtl. as a consequence,  <cit>  who used the method of  <cit> , was obliged to break chromosomes on distinct segments to carry out the meta-analysis. this subjective division of the chromosome can now be avoided thanks to our method. simulations have shown that the ratio between the number of observed qtl and the number of "true" qtl is one of the main limiting factor. the number of "true" qtl which can be assessed by the meta-analysis must be reasonable compared to the number of observed qtl . note that this also depends on the distance between true qtl. but since there are more and more qtl locations reported for a given trait and since the real number of distinct qtl locations which can be detected with usual experimental designs is limited , we assume that in many cases the ratio between observed and "true" qtl locations will steadily increase and should generally be reasonable. it is worth noting that, provided that the number of observed qtl is appropriate, the meta-analysis is able to separate "true" qtl locations even if they are closely linked .

the ultimate step toward a more accurate identification of qtl relies on finding the underlying genes. up to now, the majority of qtl isolated in plants have been cloned via positional cloning . however positional cloning of qtl is quite expensive both in terms of time and resources due to the necessity to screen recombinant individuals within large population  and to characterize these individuals with a very dense set of molecular markers. as an alternative and thanks to the advent of structural and functional genomics, qtl can also be resolved through association mapping of candidate genes. candidate genes identification is based on a assumption that the polymorphism of the gene is associated with the variation of the trait of interest. both function and mapping information have to be crossed to establish this assumption. the function of the gene may have been determined in the species of interest, based for instance on mutant analysis. more often, function is hypothesized based on sequence homology with genes the function of which has been established in model species, including possible positional cloning of qtl. gene mapping information may have been obtained in the species of interest, but may have been also inferred from synteny based projections, as illustrated by  <cit>  for rice to maize. relevancy of the colocalization between qtl and candidate genes crucially depends on the confidence interval of the qtl positions. for this purpose the reduction of the confidence interval of the qtl is an important goal  <cit> . the ability of our method to reduce the qtl confidence interval by taking advantage of pooling qtl results could contribute in an increased resolution in selecting candidate genes. it is worth noting that candidate genes are generally mapped on a framework map used as reference for the species of interest , while the qtl detections are carried out using specific populations  of interest).

therefore, the selection of candidate genes which colocalize with qtl depends also on the process used to merge these different maps. up to now, no statistical method had been proposed to combine candidate genes and qtl mapped in independent experiments, so we think that our wls strategy should increase the precision of the integration of candidate gene mapping information.

finally once candidate genes have been selected and their different haplotypes defined, association studies can be carried out. the identification of a statistically significant association between haplotype variation at a candidate gene and the target trait gives further credence on the role of this gene in the trait variation. since the last  <dig> years more and more association studies have been reported in plants  <cit> . it would be interesting to integrate these new results into a global meta-analysis framework. further developments are needed to combine onto a synthetic model the different scale of mapping: from linkage mapping  to fine mapping .
