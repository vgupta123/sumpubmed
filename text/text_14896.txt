BACKGROUND
gene co-expression analyses have provided important insights into the functional organization of the transcriptome in several species, including yeast  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and primates  <cit> . co-expressed genes frequently code for interacting proteins, which in turn leads to new insights into protein function. many co-expression patterns are conserved across species, suggesting the patterns are under selection pressure and therefore functional; a variety of studies have confirmed this premise  <cit> .

the current study focuses on the conservation of brain gene co-expression networks from the perspective of how marked differences in genetic diversity within a species  affect network structure. to examine this issue, we have created a new mouse resource, a heterogeneous stock  formed from the same eight inbred strains that have been used to create the collaborative cross   <cit> ; hereafter this resource is referred to as the hs-cc. the eight inbred strains chosen as the cc founders were the following: c57bl/6j , a/j , 129s1/svimj , nod/ltj , nzo/hiltj , cast/eij , pwk/phj  and wsb/eij . the choice of these strains was a balance between ensuring the greatest possible genetic diversity while at the same time including some strains  familiar to many biomedical scientists. using single nucleotide polymorphisms  as proxy for genetic diversity, these strains capture > 90% of the available genetic diversity within mus musculus . capturing this degree of diversity is possible because of the inclusion of the three wild-derived strains: cast , pwk  and wsb . to contrast with the hs-cc, we have chosen a b6Ã—dba/2j  f <dig> intercross and the hs <dig>  derived from intercrossing the b <dig>  d <dig>  balb/cj and lp/j strains  <cit> . the hs <dig> and hs-cc were outbred using a similar circle breeding strategy, and both are maintained as  <dig> families per generation. from the snp perspective, the hs-cc is ~ <dig> times more diverse than the f <dig> intercross and ~ <dig> times more diverse than the hs4; the actual differences in genetic diversity will be somewhat less because of genetic drift associated with breeding the hs populations for multiple generations.

gene expression data  were obtained in the striatum, a relatively homogenous brain region composed largely of medium-spiny gabaergic neurons. the striatum has a key role in a wide variety of behaviours; the functions of the striatum are well understood; and a number of key striatal genes  are known to have a highly variable expression  <cit> . the unbiased weighted gene covariance network analysis  developed by horvath and colleagues  <cit>  was used to detect gene modules. this approach has been successfully used to analyze gene expression data related to brain cancer  <cit> , the yeast cell cycle  <cit> , mouse tissue  <cit> , primate brain tissue  <cit> , diabetes  <cit> , chronic fatigue syndrome  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> .

the hs-cc data set was further characterized, emphasizing the fine spatial distribution of the gene modules. it has been suggested that groups of genes participating together in common biological functions may show a similar spatial pattern of expression  <cit> . the allen brain atlas   <cit>  provides detailed information about the spatial distribution of thousands of genes throughout the mouse brain. for the purposes of the present study, it was possible to determine whether a particular gene is specific to the striatum and/or its subdivisions and whether its spatial distribution is uniform or clustered. in addition, the aba interface allows quantification of the spatial similarity of two expression patterns using the neuroblast algorithm  <cit> . these resources were used to investigate whether groups of co-expressed genes also show spatial co-localization.

RESULTS
detectable and variable genes are preserved across populations
the initial comparison of gene expression in the three mouse populations  focused on what transcripts had a detectable expression. not all microarray probes exhibit a detectable signal because a) the target gene is not expressed, b) the expression level is below what can be reliably measured, c) the probe performs poorly, producing a false negative or d) snp within the probe sequence impair hybridization  <cit> . the snp effect is especially important when comparing genetically diverse populations. therefore, we removed all probes overlapping with known snps, as outlined in methods. next, the illumina gene expression analysis package "lumi"  <cit>  was used to assess the probability of probe expression above background. a probe was deemed to have a significant expression if the probability of being part of the background  distribution was less than threshold th =  <dig>  in at least a quarter of the samples. this procedure was applied to each of the three experiments after outlier removal and normalization of the data . as shown in figure 1a, there was a significant overlap among the three data sets for the probes meeting the threshold criteria. a total of  <dig> probes did not meet the criteria for above-threshold expression in any of the data sets.

the co-expression networks are constructed on the basis of the correlated variability across individuals. expression variability was computed by determining the coefficient of variability  for the set of  <dig> commonly detected probes ;  <dig> of the probes were in the bottom quartile for all three populations. of the remaining probes,  <dig> were in the top three quartiles in all populations, illustrating the conservation of the variance structure .

construction of gene co-expression networks
gene co-expression networks were constructed for the three data sets following methods described previously  <cit> . briefly, the power-transformed pearson correlation coefficient between gene pairs was used to infer a measure of connection strength or topological overlap  <cit> . subsequently, this measure of gene co-expression was used in an automated hierarchical clustering procedure  <cit> , resulting in the identification of several distinct modules or groups of genes with similar expression patterns. this series of steps was used to independently detect co-expression modules in each data set, identifying  <dig> distinct modules in hs-cc and  <dig> modules each in f <dig> and hs <dig>  genes left unassigned to modules were denoted with the grey color. the exact number of gene modules in any network was not considered essential because the number of modules detected is highly dependent on the clustering procedure settings. the color assignment of the modules in the three different networks was arbitrary, and the same color assignment in different networks did not carry meaning, except for the unassigned genes . the genes associated with each of the modules in all three populations are listed in additional file  <dig> 

comparisons of the hs-cc, f <dig> and hs <dig> networks are illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the data revealed that essentially all f <dig> and hs <dig> modules had a counterpart in the hs-cc and vice versa , although some of the larger hs-cc modules fragmented into two or more f <dig> or hs <dig> modules. an examination of the unassigned "grey" genes across the three networks revealed that their identity was largely preserved.

to further quantify the level of module preservation, a matrix comparison procedure was used. each module was described by a topological overlap matrix  with entries quantifying the level of gene pair co-expression. the matrices were compared by computing the mantel matrix correlation  <cit>  between the hs-cc modules and the same genes in the f <dig> and hs <dig> networks. a high matrix correlation signifies that the pattern of pairwise topological overlap in two different data sets was similar. statistical significance was evaluated by repeatedly  shuffling the columns of one matrix and recomputing the correlation using the randomized matrix  <cit> . for the hs-cc and f <dig> comparison, the matrix correlation values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the hs-cc to hs <dig> comparison yielded correlation values between  <dig>   and  <dig>  . all correlation values were significant at p < 10- <dig> or better, except for salmon module . thus, the module structure was largely preserved. this congruence suggested that each module must have functionally conserved attributes; these attributes were investigated in the hs-cc.

gene ontology  annotation of the hs-cc modules
go annotation  <cit>  was used to determine if the modules had unique functional properties and/or were associated with distinct subcellular compartments . for example, the pink module was enriched for go biological processes that included the following: central nervous system development , regulation of neurotransmitter levels , regulation of timing of neuron differentiation , neuron development  and forebrain development . the red module was significantly enriched in genes corresponding to go category behavioural fear response ; the tan module was enriched with genes associated with ensheathment of neurons , regulation of action potential , myelination , oligodendrocyte cell fate commitment , glial cell fate specification  and myelin assembly . only the most significant go annotations are reported here, after taking into account the nested structure of the go categories  <cit> . bonferroni correction was applied because of comparisons against all  <dig> modules. a full list of significant module go annotations is found in additional file  <dig> csv.

proteome interactions and transcriptome co-expression
the hs-cc co-expression patterns were compared with the compiled protein-protein interactions  in the human protein reference database   <cit> . first, the network genes were cross-referenced with the list of hprd gene products. second, network genes with ppi interactions were selected, and the average topological overlap was computed. comparing the average topological overlap of the ppi genes against an empirical distribution of random gene groups revealed that the ppi group had significantly higher topological overlap . these data confirm that co-expression patterns in the transcriptome are related to interactions in the proteome, in agreement with previous results  <cit> .

modules overlap with specific brain cell types
module membership was compared against lists of genes associated with neuronal cell types  <cit> . several modules  were enriched with neuronal cell markers . the tan module was enriched with oligodendrocite specific genes, which is concordant with its go annotation for oligodendrocyte cell fate commitment. the magenta and yellow modules contained genes associated with astrocytes. using an additional data set that identifies genes highly specific to subcategories of striatal neurons  <cit> , we found that the red module contains several genes associated with striatopallidal neurons.

spatial co-localization and transcriptome co-expression
gene module membership was compared with the spatial distribution of the genes from the aba  <cit> . sets of co-localized genes were constructed beginning with the ten genes closest to the eigengene for each module; the eigengene modelled the representative pattern of module expression  <cit> . each gene in the module was then assigned a measure of module membership "kme", on the basis of its correlation with the eigengene. for each network module, the ten genes with highest kme were selected. for each of these ten "seed" genes, the aba was used to find the  <dig> genes with the most similar striatal spatial distribution. from this group, those present in the hs-cc network were denoted as the "co-localized" group. the fisher exact test was used to assess the overlap between the spatially co-localized group and all members of a respective module, and bonferroni correction was applied to correct for comparing each of the  <dig> modules. for eight of the modules, the overlap was signficant, with bonferroni corrected p-values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> Ã—10- <dig> 

the extent of correspondence between co-expression and co-localization was further explored using the full set of pairwise interactions in the transcriptome with the set of pairwise spatial relationships captured in the aba  <cit> . for a module, the transcriptome relationships were summarized by the topological overlap matrix. a similar size matrix for pairwise similarity in spatial profiles was constructed using the neuroblast algorithm  <cit> . because only the top  <dig> most similar spatial profiles to a given gene are identified by neuroblast, the spatial similarity matrices were sparse. however, the mantel test  <cit>  still detected a moderately strong relationship between the co-expression and co-localization matrices for three of the modules: red , purple  and tan .

brain explorer  <cit>  was used to visually inspect the spatial properties of the co-localized module genes. for the ten co-localized genes closest  to the module eigengene, the expression levels were superimposed and plotted over the extent of the striatum . a few of the co-localized modules displayed distinctly localized patterns of spatial expression. the high expression of the midnight blue module  appeared largely restricted to the nucleus accumbens, while the purple module  displayed a very distinctive dorsal tier pattern of expression within the caudate putamen. a more typical pattern is that of the red module  which appeared highly expressed through most but not all of the area of the striatum. the go categories enriched in the midnight blue, purple and red modules are found in additional file  <dig> 

transcriptional regulatory analysis of gene modules
module-specific genes were examined for overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites . the strategy employed is detailed in methods. using a false discovery rate threshold of  <dig> , we identified  <dig> tfs preferentially affecting  <dig> gene modules . the most highly enriched tf was wilm's tumour suppressor  in the pink module ; this module is modestly enriched in go categories associated with the regulation of transcription and neuronal development  and has also been associated in the literature with distinct neuropathological conditions such as alzheimer's disease  <cit> . the two modules  that show distinct patterns of expression  were not associated with tf enrichment. the blue and red modules were enriched in specificity protein - <dig>  which is known to have a role in the regulation of striatal gene expression .

discussion
previous studies have reported preservation of gene co-expression modules across mouse strains  <cit>  and even across species  <cit> . the level of preservation or divergence is usually quantified by the amount of overlap of gene modules from different networks. while this approach has been proven useful and we also employed it in the present study , it is highly dependent on the clustering procedure. we therefore employed an additional, complementary approach of quantifying the level of preservation: the mantel test of correlation between two matrices  <cit> . this method has been used extensively in quantifying relationships between genetic, geographic and environmental distances  <cit> , and more recently has been adapted to quantification of differentially expressed genes  <cit> . if topological overlap between genes is preserved, this is detected as high correlation between the respective tom matrices. additionally, the mantel test can be used for comparing any similar rank matrices, as we illustrate by quantifying the relationship between topological overlap and spatial co-localization, both of which can be represented as matrices of pairwise interactions. overall, the data illustrate that, despite a > 6-fold difference in genetic diversity , the overall module structure of the striatal networks was preserved. intuitively, this congruence may seem obvious because the striatum performs a similar function in all three populations. however, there was a concern that the marked increase of genetic diversity in the hs-cc, as compared with the f <dig> and hs <dig>  would have such marked effects on gene expression variance that the overlap of the networks and their modules would be difficult to detect. while the topological overlap matrices did suggest that there are some differences and that some modules agree significantly better than others, the overall structure remained intact.

the hs-cc data illustrate that relatively sophisticated module details can be detected with relatively modest sample sizes. confirming the results of others  <cit> , it was possible to detect modules that were enriched in genes associated with neurons , oligodendrocytes  or astrocytes . only the yellow module showed an overlap. these data suggest that there are sufficient numbers of each cell type  to allow the clustering procedures to detect cell-type specific modules. a similar argument could be used to explain our ability  to detect unique spatial localizations for some modules. a majority of genes in our network were categorized in aba as having uniform spatial distribution. however, the striatum is a complex structure with distinct subdivisions, some of which have been associated with specific behavioural states  <cit> . even the most ubiquitous cell type within the striatum, the medium-spiny neuron, displays distinct morphological characteristics based on its spatial position, for instance in the core or shell of the nucleus accumbens  <cit> . microarray samples are an amalgam of cell types from many distinct anatomical substructures. while gene expression studies have been instrumental in mapping behaviour into specific physiological processes, progress is hampered by the lack of more specific information about the cell types and anatomical substructures directly involved in patterns of gene co-expression. our study leverages the vast amount of information available in mouse atlases such as aba. this approach can be further enhanced by information emerging from studies using laser-captured neurons  <cit> .

the detection of transcription factors  specific to distinct module genes provides a candidate mechanism for generating the co-expressed patterns of gene expression. we were unable to align the distinct patterns of expression in the midnight blue and purple modules with specific tfs. the purple module is of particular interest given the overexpression of the module genes in the nucleus accumbens and the role the accumbens has in a variety of behaviours including reward, reinforcement and drug abuse  <cit> . understanding the factors associated with co-expression in this region has the potential to lead to new molecular-based treatments. the red module, which is associated with gene expression throughout the striatum , is enriched in the specificity protein  <dig>  tf; the blue module also showed enrichment in sp <dig>  sp <dig> is known to affect pathways associated with neuronal survival and death  <cit> , and the dysregulation of sp <dig> has been associated with alzheimer's disease  <cit> . the antibiotic mithramycin binds to g-c rich dna sequences to inhibit the binding of sp <dig>  <cit> . previous work  <cit>  has shown that the administration of mithramycin blocks the striatal toxicity associated with chronic methamphetamine administration. it is of interest to speculate that this effect may be mediated through an influence on the genes within the red and blue modules.

CONCLUSIONS
we here present an integrative approach to the analysis of mouse brain transcriptome data. the modular structure of the striatum transcriptome is largely preserved despite large genetic differences among the hs-cc, f <dig> and hs <dig> populations. gene co-expression modules have spatial co-localization in some cases. a small set of tfs has a strong overabundance specific to distinct modules. these tfs have been previously associated with changes in behaviour or neuropathology, indicating that using a network-based comparison holds strong promise for the elucidation of underlying regulatory mechanisms. finally, to our knowledge this is the first report on the application of gene network analyses to hs populations. hs populations have proven useful for the fine mapping of quatitative trait loci  and for the integration of qtl and gene expression data  <cit> .
