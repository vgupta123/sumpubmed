BACKGROUND
many scientific articles report that coevolution between plant and their predators is a matter of arms race. the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in plants produces a vast array of defensive allelochemicals to cope with herbivores and pathogens  <cit> . on their side, many insect herbivores have evolved the ability to metabolize these defence compounds, thus have adapted to overcome much of the toxicity  <cit> .

furanocoumarins are molecules often used to illustrate this coevolution. two kinds of furanocoumarins are described, which differ by the position of a furan group grafted on a coumarin core molecule either at position c6-c <dig> for linear molecules or c7-c <dig> for the angular one . due to their chemical structure, the linear molecules are highly toxic to a broad spectrum of predators. although angular molecules are less toxic, the resistance spectrum is expanded when the plants simultaneously produce both linear and angular structures. these kinds of molecules have been reported to exist predominantly in four plant families: rutaceae, moraceae, fabaceae and apiaceae . the distribution of linear and angular furanocoumarins differs between each of these four plant families, highlighting a difference in their evolutionary path. in particular, only linear furanocoumarins have been reported in rutaceae and moraceae, while both linear and angular furanocoumarins have been described in fabaceae. it is important to note that no plant has so far been identified that produces only angular molecules, which has led some authors to conclude that linear furanocoumarins appeared earlier during evolution and that the rise of the angular molecules was related to a strengthening of the defensive capacity of plants with respect to the attack by phytopathogenic insects  <cit> . apiaceae, the fourth family to produce furanocoumarins, is an interesting case study since they comprise the  <dig> possible evolutionary stages related to the occurrence of furanocoumarins in higher plants:  some species of apiaceae are unable to synthesize these molecules,  others are able to synthesize only linear furanocoumarins,  and others contain both linear and angular molecules. within apiaceae the subfamily apioideae is the largest of the four subfamilies described in apiaceae consisting of more than  <dig> species and more than  <dig> genera  <cit> , even though many of these genera are not well resolved  <cit> . the other subfamilies are azorelloideae, mackinlayoideae, and saniculoideae, and more than  <dig> species in apiaceae have not been classified in sub-families but have been classified in tribes only .fig.  <dig> simplified furanocoumarin biosynthesis pathway. grey dots corresponds to demonstrate or putative cytochrome p <dig> dependent steps



the understanding of the furanocoumarin biosynthesis is not yet fully resolved  <cit> . investigations carried out in the late eighties by hamerski and colleagues on ammi majus cell cultures using radioactive precursors demonstrated that many steps in the biosynthesis of these molecules are catalyzed by enzymes of the cytochrome p <dig> family  <cit> . recently a cytochrome p <dig> subfamily has been described with members existing in parsnip , celery  and ammi majus, which has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of linear and angular furanocoumarins. cyp71aj1- <dig> were identified as psoralen synthases and cyp71aj <dig> has been characterized as an angelicin synthase  <cit>  . both enzymes catalyze the same kind of reaction, cleaving the c-c bond at the c-3’ position forming the furanocoumarin skeleton and acetone in equimolar amounts  <cit> .

despite low sequence similarity, the overall structure of cytochromes p <dig> is generally conserved and six substrate recognition sites  have been identified to be necessary in the active site  <cit> . thus, the srs1- <dig> regions are very important for the binding and the subsequent enzymatic conversion of the substrate  . other characteristic regions of plant and animal cytochrome p450s are the proline rich membrane hinge, the sequence surrounding the cysteine that is the axial ligand to the heme, the i-helix  involved in oxygen binding, and the e-r-r triad using the glu and arg of the k-helix consensus  and the arg in the “perf” consensus. the e-r-r triad is generally thought to be involved in locking the heme pocket into position and to ensure stabilization of the conserved core structure  <cit> .fig.  <dig> srs alignment of  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> belonging to the cyp71aj subfamily. srs means substrate recognition site. the three-amino-acid motif is highlighted with a grey box. residues likely to constitute the active site are indicated with triangles, and those in black are considered more reliable for their position in the homology models than those in grey



for several molecules, including  <dig> -dihydroxy-7-methoxy- <dig> -benzoxazin-3-one , it has been reported that allelic variants of a single cytochrome p <dig> subfamily are involved in each step of the biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . concerning the furanocoumarin pathway, already two enzymes belonging to the same sub-family  catalyze the synthesis of two different molecules. it is therefore conceivable that other enzymes belonging to the same subfamily are able to catalyze some other steps. to confirm or reject this assumption, we explored the evolution of this cytochrome p <dig> subfamily through the study of  <dig> cyp71aj coding sequences. in addition to the already described cyp71aj1- <dig>   <dig> new sequences were identified through experimental approaches or data mining of transcriptomic libraries in various apiaceae. the identification of genes encoding cyp71aj in plants that do not produce furanocoumarins provide evidence that this enzyme family is likely to play a broader role in the metabolism of these plants and probably result from a complex evolution process. this is confirmed by the absence of furanocoumarin  metabolisation of some corresponding proteins and by an in silico analysis of the srs1- <dig> regions which highlights residues important for accepting linear or angular dehydrofuranocoumarins or other substrates.

RESULTS
cyp71ajs isolated from pastinaca sativa
pastinaca sativa is an apiaceous plant able to synthesize both linear and angular furanocoumarins. in order to decipher the biosynthesis pathway of these molecules at the molecular level, we searched for cyp71aj orthologous genes in an rna-seq database generated from mrna extracted from parsnip eight week old plantlets. in addition to cyp71aj <dig> and -aj <dig>  which were respectively assigned to psoralen and angelicin synthases  <cit> , we identified a new gene, cyp71aj <dig> encoding an enzyme sharing 76 % and 75 % identity with cyp71aj <dig> and -aj <dig>  respectively. this new coding sequence was cloned into the pyedp <dig> expression vector and the corresponding protein expressed in yeast in order to functionally characterize the enzyme. to examine that the protein was properly expressed, we added a tag of 6xhis to the c-terminus and performed a western blot prior to any enzymatic functional investigation. a metabolic screening was performed using  <dig> different furanocoumarins  including  <dig> linear molecules and  <dig> angular molecules. since none of them was metabolized, we extended the screening to  <dig> additional coumarins and  <dig> hydroxycinnamic acids  with no more success. these first experimental results suggest that not all the enzymes belonging to this cyp71aj cytochrome p <dig> subfamily share the same substrate specificity. to investigate this point, we compared the peptidic sequence of this enzyme and the sequence of enzymes whose function has already been established ie cyp71aj <dig> and cyp71aj <dig>  although, the overall sequence identity is close to 75 % between cyp71aj <dig> and psoralen synthase/angelicin synthase, it decreases significantly, when the comparison is focused on the substrate recognition sites  conserved in cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . this analysis shows that cyp71aj <dig> is closer to cyp71aj <dig> than cyp71aj <dig>  especially for srs <dig>  srs <dig>  and srs <dig>  which are well conserved between cyp71aj <dig> and cyp71aj <dig>  however,  <dig> triple mutation lead to important modifications in srs <dig>  srs <dig>  and srs <dig> and may change the substrate specificity of these enzymes. in addition, larbat and collaborators assumed that srs <dig> and srs <dig> form an access channel for the substrate to the active site  <cit> . whereas srs <dig> doesn’t display significant changes between the three enzymes, a detailed analysis of srs <dig> highlights differences of almost all the amino acid residues. for example, a modification of leu204/ala <dig> in cyp71aj3/ <dig> , met207/thr <dig> in cyp71aj3/ <dig>  or met <dig> in cyp71aj3- <dig>  will affect the access to the active site of the enzyme. finally, the appearance of a proline  in cyp71aj <dig> instead of a threonine  in cyp71aj3/ <dig> might involve a structural modification in srs <dig> and probably also impact the substrate specificity of this enzyme.table  <dig> sequence comparison of srs identified in cyp71aj <dig>  psoralen synthase  and angelicin synthase . results are presented as percentage identity



the bloom in the cyp71aj subfamily
the lack of metabolisation of a wide range of coumarins or derivatives and the presence of many differences within srs of cyp71aj <dig> in comparison to cyp71aj3/ <dig> suggest a functional diversification within this p <dig> subfamily. as furanocoumarins have appeared lately in certain plants to defend against attacks by predators, we assume that genes involved in the synthesis of these molecules are deriving from older genes displaying other functions. among the apiaceae, it has been reported that some genera could produce furanocoumarins while others could not. therefore we investigated the occurrence of orthologous genes in different apiaceae transcriptomic libraries available in databases by using blast searches. this investigation, in addition to an experimental pcr-based fishing approach using primers targeted toward conserved sequences, led us to identify  <dig> new sequences encoding cyp71aj enzymes in  <dig> different apiaceous plant species. among the  <dig> coding sequences identified this way,  <dig> were considered as full-length and were used in addition to the already described cyp71aj1- <dig> for subsequent in silico investigations . in addition to the plants listed in table  <dig>  mrnas were also extracted from other apiaceae species, namely crithmum maritimum l. , pimpinella cretica , oenanthe divaricate , and eryngium campestre as well as sanicula europaea , but in these species no cyp71aj sequences were identified using the pcr approach with the primers described here .table  <dig> full-length cyp71aj members included in the dn/ds selection tests

phylogenetic analyses of the  <dig> full-length cyp71ajs revealed that these enzymes are grouped in at least  <dig> large clades  including  <dig> subclades . eight enzymes are grouped on a first cluster, which is branched into two parts. the first contains enzymes whose involvement in the synthesis of furanocoumarins was already demonstrated , and the second containing enzymes of unknown functions . this latter group includes a gene  isolated from thapsia garganica which has been reported not to produce furanocoumarins, giving therefore arguments in favour of a functional diversification of cyp71ajs. the presence, in the same subclade, of genes isolated from d. carota and a. graveolens which are able to produce linear furanocoumarins, is consistent with the assumption that this enzyme subfamily has evolved from ancestral enzymes probably displaying different substrate specificity. indeed, in this first clade, a. graveolens harbours two divergent coding sequences: cyp71aj <dig> which was described as a psoralen synthase  and cyp71aj <dig>  for which the function is still unknown.fig.  <dig> phylogeny tree of  <dig> full length cyp71aj. the tree is based on a muscle alignment followed by personal fitting, then a tree building using lg within phyml. all is performed in geneious®  <dig> . <dig>  reconstructed ancestral genes were analysed for notes indicated with dots. alignment can be found in additional file 4




a second clearly different clade could be identified  with two different but sequential similar sub-clades. similarly to the clade i, plants producing cyp71ajs in this second clade have been described as being either producing furanocoumarins or not. the previously tested cyp71aj <dig> which was identified in p. sativa, a plant producing furanocoumarins, belongs to sub-clade ii- <dig>  here we completed our study by carrying out the heterologous expression of two additional proteins, cyp71aj <dig> and cyp71aj <dig>  identified in two thapsia species which are reported not to produce furanocoumarins. a functional screening  performed on these proteins belonging to the group ii- <dig> was unsuccessful thus reinforcing the hypothesis of a function not related to the synthesis of molecules close to coumarins.

evolution in the srs regions of cyp71ajs
substrate recognition sites in cyp71ajs
despite great variation between the enzymes in the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily, six substrate recognition sites  have been identified constituting essential residues in the active site  <cit> . to investigate the potential relation between primary sequence and structure we generated homology models. the different cyp71aj clades have distinct patterns in these six srs regions. the srs <dig> regions of the groups i- <dig> , i- <dig> , ii- <dig> , and ii- <dig>  exhibit a “three-amino-acid” motif specific for each of these sub-clades, whereas group i- <dig> and i- <dig> share this motif  . these motif are likely be important for the substrate acceptance, and in the homology models  the second residue in the motif is predicted to be in close proximity to the substrate after the final substrate orientation. the srs <dig> motifs for groups ii- <dig> and ii- <dig> have larger residues than the residues of proteins functionally assigned to groups i- <dig> and i- <dig>  which encode angelicin synthase and psoralen synthase, respectively. for all the groups, a proline localized beside amino acids harbouring large side chains  could play an important role in shaping the srs <dig> region, particularly since proline residues structurally interrupt alpha helices  <cit> . hydrophobic residues in the srs <dig> region have been found to be conserved in cytochrome p450s described in insect herbivores feeding on furanocoumarin producing plants, e.g. in papilio spp. feeding on apiaceous plants  <cit> . a similar pattern could be present in the apiaceous cytochromes p <dig> involved in coumarin biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> potential active site configurations for five cyp71aj groups. the homology models were constructed in cphmodels- <dig>  and voidoo was used for cavity calculations. srs1: blue; srs2 + 3: green; srs4: yellow; srs5: orange; srs6: red; and heme-group: grey. the three-amino-acid motives in srs <dig> that are likely important for substrate acceptance are indicated with dashed ovals. residue differences between groups ii- <dig> and ii- <dig> are marked with black. other residue likely to be important for the active sites are discussed in the text. a) cyp71aj <dig>  b) cyp71aj <dig>  c) cyp71aj <dig> and cyp71aj <dig>  d) cyp71aj32



srs <dig> and srs <dig> may be of lesser importance for the final structure of the substrate, but, as mentioned previously, could be important for substrate acceptance. the srs <dig>  has many residues important for influencing the orientation of the substrate within the active site and for the transfer of the oxygen during product formation via a negatively charged residue  together with a polar uncharged side-chain  residue. residues very likely to face inwards in the active site are indicated in fig.  <dig> 

the srs <dig> region for group ii- <dig> and ii- <dig> are nearly identical, but the pro-val in these groups would make the active sites less polar than in the case of i- <dig> and i- <dig> where the equivalent residues are thr-ala. in group i- <dig> the srs <dig> region is very similar to that of i- <dig> . the srs <dig> region across the different groups also bears a high degree of similarity and the residues predicted to constitute the active site are not markedly different.

some plant cytochrome p <dig> enzymes may be under co-evolutionary selection pressure with certain codon sites under positive selection, which especially would be interesting for codon sites within the srs regions. thus dn/ds selection analyses were performed with two different methods  to test for codon sites under positive but also negative  selection. the meme method indicated that  <dig> sites are potentially under positive selection and three of the codon sites suggested by the rel method were congruent with these. these congruent amino acids were neither found to be in the srs regions nor close to the interface involved in the interaction with a nadph cytochrome p <dig> reductase . they are thus likely false positives. for the remaining  <dig> codon sites found with the rel method, one was found within srs <dig> , one within srs <dig> , and one in srs <dig> . these may not be residues critical for the substrate uptake and conversion; however, they might be an indication that these codon sites are under less stringent selection and mutations in these codons will have minor or no implication for the tertiary conformation of the cyp71aj enzymes. of the  <dig> codon sites suggested by the rel method to be under negative selection, two were found within srs <dig> , one in srs <dig> , and one in srs <dig> . the tyrosine and tryptophan residues in srs <dig> were not selected by the two methods.

to further investigate sites that might be under selection in the srs regions, but additionally including the physiochemical properties of the residues, we performed two prime  analyses using five conant-stadler  <cit>  properties  and the five atchley et al.  <cit>  properties . both models found the residue coded at codon site  <dig> in srs <dig> to have significant properties. interestingly, this residue is the second residue in the three-amino-acid motif mentioned earlier . the two models selected this residue on different criteria; the conant-stadler model based changing properties on chemical composition and conserved properties on iso-electric point, whereas the significance in the atchley et al. properties model for changing properties was based on volume and conserved properties based on heat capacity  <cit> . the changing properties thus appear related to volume and chemical composition. the conant-stadler method found codon site  <dig> in srs <dig> to be important based on changing properties in hydropathy, i.e. the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the residue. this codon site does not code for one of the six residues suggested to be directly involved in the constitution of the active site, and the corresponding residue for this codon site in all  <dig> sequences are hydrophobic, thus not fully supporting the prediction. the atchley et al. model found four putatively important residues in the srs regions, two in both srs <dig>  and srs <dig> . the codon site  <dig> was an significant residue  based on changing properties in secondary structure, along with codon site  <dig>  based on conserved properties in polarity and iso-electric point. the latter, predicted by the homology models to constitute the active site, appears to differ at this point for group i- <dig>  and group i- <dig>  in that angelicin synthase  has the polar residue thr <dig> corresponding to the hydrophobic residue met <dig> in psoralen synthase . both codon sites selected in srs <dig> were based on conserved properties, and not predicted to constitute the active site .

structural analysis
a full-length cyp71aj  and a fragment  were identified from the chinese species bupleurum chinense using transcriptomic data. fragments were also identified in b. sacilifolium  and b. scorzonerifolium . a phylogenetic analysis restricted to the partial protein sequences suggested that these four sequences group together in group i- <dig> . when comparing i- <dig> to the other cyp71aj groups many residues are conserved in the srs <dig> region emphasizing the possible high structural importance of this site for the conformation of the substrate. the “three-amino-acid” motifs of the bupleurum cyp71ajs are quite distinct from the other cyp71aj members with vfy being present in cyp71aj <dig> as opposed to van for the group i- <dig> and i- <dig>  aid for the group i- <dig>  iws for the group ii- <dig> and iwd for the group ii- <dig>  the active site volume of the cyp71aj <dig> homology model was calculated to be 268 Å <dig> .

homology modelling and subsequent docking has previously been carried out on psoralen synthase  from ammi majus  to predict the binding mode of the -marmesin substrate and the -columbianetin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor  <cit> . the template structure for this model was cyp2c <dig> . it was predicted that the -marmesin substrate in the cyp71aj <dig> homology model had its dehydrofuran-ring proximal to residues ala <dig> and thr <dig> in srs <dig>  thr <dig> in srs <dig>  and thr <dig> in srs <dig>  it was further predicted that met <dig> and val <dig> in srs <dig> and ala <dig>  leu <dig>  val <dig>  and pro <dig> in srs <dig> enclosed the coumarin ring and positioned the c-3’ carbon atom of -marmesin  <dig>  Å from the iron-oxo center of the heme-group. whereas, the distance to the c-3’ of -columbianetin in a similar conformation was  <dig>  Å and thus unlikely to undergo any reaction  <cit> . according to larbat and collaborators  <cit> , site-directed mutagenesis of met <dig> to a val residue in srs <dig> of cyp71aj <dig> didn’t change the enzymatic activity and therefore diminishes the putative importance of this residue. this is confirmed by our homology model of cyp71aj <dig> in which met <dig> faces outwards and seems to play a minor role in forming the active site in this psoralen synthase.

interestingly for srs <dig> residue cys <dig> is only found in the angelicin synthase , whereas other cyp71aj groups have a phe in this position. in the cyp71aj <dig> homology model phe <dig> together with ile <dig> of the aid motif, appear to be the most important residues in srs <dig>  the phe, however, is also present in the other cyp71aj groups. residues met <dig> and leu <dig> in srs <dig> of the psoralen synthase seal the proximal part of the active site cavity from the heme-group, whereas the met <dig> residue corresponds to thr <dig> in the angelicin synthase, as mentioned earlier. this polar thr residue in the angelicin synthase could interact with a hydroxyl-group in -columbianetin. in srs <dig> the residue-pair trp-asp in the n-terminal of the i-helix exists in both psoralen and angelicin synthases and might be involved in locking the coumarin core in place, with the asp residue potentially forming hydrogen bonds. for the psoralen synthase in srs <dig>  the residue-pair gly296-ala <dig> constitute the cavity closest to the iron-oxo-heme group with the corresponding leu303-gly <dig> in the angelicin synthase. residues thr <dig> and thr <dig> in srs <dig> of cyp71aj <dig>  and -aj <dig> , respectively, could also play a role of hydrogen-bond formations to hydroxyl-groups of the dehydrofuranocoumarin substrates.

a conspicuous feature of group i- <dig> encoding the angelicin synthases is the missing pro in the srs <dig>  which is present in all of the other cyp71aj groups. interestingly, this residue was predicted by the rel method to be under negative selection. this difference has the effect of reducing the distance of thr <dig> from the iron-oxo-heme center in angelicin synthase compared to the corresponding thr <dig> in psoralen synthase and possibly pushes leu <dig> in angelicin synthase further into the active site compared to the corresponding val <dig> in psoralen synthase. this is particularly important because changes in the srs <dig> have been found to alter the substrate specificity for other plant p <dig> enzymes  <cit> .

thr <dig> in srs <dig> seems to be important for constituting the active site in cyp71aj <dig> as it did in the cyp71aj <dig> homology model constructed by larbat and collaborators  <cit> . ser <dig> takes the same spatial position in the homology model of cyp71aj <dig> and is likely to play a similar role to that of the thr in psoralen synthase, possibly also interacting with the isopropyloxy-group of the dehydrofuranocoumarin substrate. the whole active volume calculations for both models include a potential channel for the substrate uptake, and are thus estimated higher than the active sites alone. the size differences between cyp71aj <dig> and -aj <dig> are not considered markedly different though. the largest differences between these two functionally characterized cyp71aj members are thus found in the “three-amino-acid” motif in srs <dig>  the central residue in srs <dig>  the second residue pair in srs <dig>  and in the deletion of pro in srs <dig> in angelicin synthase. it could be speculated that these changes alone could shift the functionality from one enzyme to the other.

group i- <dig> members from the scandiceae tribe, i.e. cyp71aj <dig> from daucus carota and cyp71aj <dig> from thapsia garganica, have their “three-amino-acid” motif in common with the psoralen synthases of group i- <dig> . many residues likely to constitute the active site are also in common for the other srs regions between these two groups. it could therefore be conceivable that cyp71aj <dig> and –aj <dig> are putative psoralen synthases. the third member of this group, i.e. cyp71aj <dig> from a. graveolens, clearly has a strong homology with the characterized psoralen synthase  from the same species; however, the “three-amino acid” motif differs on the second residue, which is predicted by prime and the homology models to be significant to the substrate uptake and binding.

the relatively high sequence similarity  between the two groups makes it very likely that they metabolize the same or similar substrates. the active sites in the homology models of these groups were found to be 277 Å <dig> , and appear being smaller than the cavities of the psoralen synthase  and angelicin synthase . this probably results from larger hydrophobic residues such as trp <dig> in srs <dig>  and phe <dig> in srs <dig>  taking up considerable space of the active site cavities . asp <dig> in cyp71aj <dig> corresponds to ser <dig> in cyp71aj <dig> for the three-amino-acid motif in srs <dig>  in the srs <dig> region thr <dig> in cyp71aj <dig> corresponds to ser <dig> in -aj <dig> for the residue-pair involved in the electron transfer, and leu <dig> in cyp71aj <dig> corresponds to val <dig> in cyp71aj <dig> located in srs <dig>  these are all minor differences but could be of importance since the substrates for the two novel groups seems to be different from the psoralen and angelicin synthases. for instance, the val <dig> in srs <dig> of the homology models is predicted to be just next to the thr <dig> in srs <dig>  residues asp <dig> in srs <dig> is very likely to play a crucial role in the site with a carboxyl acid group in close proximity  to the iron-centre of the heme-group potentially being an active part in the product formation.

cyp71aj occurrence within the apiaceae subfamily apioideae
new putative members of both the psoralen and angelicin synthases have been identified . putative psoralen synthase sequences have been identified in seseli montanum , angelica archangelica ssp archangelica , d. carota ssp sativus , ferula communis ssp glaucus , thapsia garganica , and in heracleum lanatum  and new putative angelicin synthases sequences, in addition to the one already functionally characterized from pastinaca sativa , have been identified in heracleum mantegazzianum , a. archangelica ssp archangelica , and h. lanatum . as expected, all these plants have been reported to produce furanocoumarins. in addition to these two sub-clades, we highlighted at least two novel subclades within the cyp71aj subfamily in the apioideae subfamily.

in some of the species investigated, multiple cyp71aj paralogous genes have been identified. these include p. sativa, where in addition to psoralen synthase  and angelicin synthase , two new enzymes have been found; namely cyp71aj <dig>  and cyp71aj <dig> . the full-length sequence of cyp71aj <dig>  however, has not yet been obtained. five cyp71aj members were also identified in the transcriptome of h. lanatum: a group i- <dig> member  putative psoralen synthase , putative angelicin synthase , a group ii- <dig> member , and a unique cyp71aj sequence  that seems to fall into group i- <dig> . genera pastinaca and heracleum  synthesize linear and angular furanocoumarins in high amounts. genus angelica  synthesize linear furanocoumarins and angular dihydrofuranocoumarins predominantly with a few exceptions such as a. angelica ssp archangelica, which is also able to synthesize angular furanocoumarins  <cit> . interestingly, the sequence comparison highlights that the angelicin synthase  found in this angelica species is close to the angelicin synthases of pastinaca  and heracleum . given the phylogenetic distance between these genera, it is likely that the angelicin synthase gene could have occurred from a duplication/mutation of the psoralen synthase gene.

in d. carota ssp sativus , a novel putative psoralen synthase  and a group ii- <dig> member  have been identified. transcriptomic data from different cultivars  <cit>  as well as pcr on d. carota grown in the greenhouse were used for the identification. many of the species in tribe daucinae are able to biosynthesize linear furanocoumarins but in small amounts compared to the species in the apioid superclade  <cit> . apium graveolens has not been described as being able to biosynthesize angular furanocoumarins. therefore, the absence of an angelicin synthase sequence in the transcriptomic data of a. graveolens is not surprising.

apioideae and saniculoideae subfamilies  diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago from the rest of the apiaceae family, with the bupleurum genus considered being one of the earliest split outs  <cit> . finding cyp71aj subfamily members in bupleurum shows that subfamily cyp71aj has been a part of apioideae throughout its evolutionary history.

the ancestral genes calculated for the branching points between groups i- <dig> and i- <dig> and between groups i- <dig> and i-3 + i- <dig> both resemble putative psoralen synthases. the ancestral gene for the branching point between clade ii and clade i  retains the codon coding for trp  on the second position in the three-amino-acid motif, but a codon that codes for asn  on the third position in the motif. the srs <dig> residues coded by the codons in this ancestral genes are predicted to be the same as the ones of the members in clade ii, which also applies for regions srs <dig> and srs <dig>  for the ancestral genes between the two clades the three-amino-acid motif is the same as cyp71aj <dig>  the first residue pair  in srs <dig> is predicted to be the same as for cyp71aj <dig> and cyp71aj <dig>  which also applies for the second residue-pair  in srs <dig>  all these ancestral reconstructed sequences may be too conservative in their prediction though underestimating changes that have occurred in the srs regions. the functionality of the cyp71aj ancestors is still a conundrum.

blooms of p <dig> genes and coevolution
every living species is confronted at every moment with new situations to which it must adapt to live or to survive. the implementation of these evolutionary phenomena is more or less quick according to necessity. plants have developed a large range of strategies that enable them to adapt to many situations. the strategy that is likely the most effective is related to the ability of plants to produce an arsenal of thousands of molecules deriving from universal precursors  adapted to respond to many different situations. this highly complex specialized metabolism probably appears due to gene duplication phenomenon associated with neo-functionalizing mutations that result in modified substrate specificities and modifications of enzymatic reactions resulting in a blooming of enzyme families. the large number of transcriptomic reports that have been published in recent years show that the number of genes coding for cytochrome p450s is significantly higher in plants than in other organisms. for example, it may be noted that less than  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> encoding genes have been described in the baker’s yeast genome , around one hundred genes in humans and close to  <dig> genes have been identified in the small genome of arabidopsis. this enzyme family therefore seems to play an important role in the adaptation of plants to their environment through their proliferation in plant genomes. in this work, we have carried out the study in a cytochrome p <dig> subfamily sharing more than 60 % identity with each other at the amino acid level. heterologous expression and attempts for functional characterization allowed us to show that remodelling of the active site of these enzymes have led to changes in substrate specificity. an enlarged active site is only observed in cyp71aj able to catalyse the synthesis of furanocoumarins, which are molecules, reported in only some apiaceous plants. it is therefore likely that these functionally characterized enzymes are deriving from older genes whose functions have not been identified yet. a broader screening geared towards smaller molecules but common to all apiaceous plants will help to unveil the functional origins of this gene family.

CONCLUSIONS
recently, karamat and collaborators  <cit>  identified a single prenyltransferase from parsley able to transform umbelliferone into both demethylsuberosin and osthenol, two dehydrofuranocoumarins that are the precursors of all linear and angular furanocoumarins, respectively. surprisingly, the same authors showed that both dehydrofuranocoumarin forms are present in plants such as parsley and ruta graveolens, which do not biosynthesize angular furanocoumarins. therefore, it seems clear that the limiting step leading to the synthesis of both kinds of isomers is related to the presence of subsequent different cytochromes p <dig>  the biosynthesis of angular furanocoumarins is considered as a more recently evolved trait. the finding of angelicin synthases in the apioid superclade only and with the finding of putative psoralen synthases in earlier diverged lineages support this view. the angelicin synthases have likely occurred from a gene duplication of the psoralen synthase. given that, the sequence identity between the angelica  to the heracleum and pastinaca  this is likely to have happened only once . the ability might have been lost in other angelica spp., but this is still unresolved.fig.  <dig> cladogram showing the occurrence of the cyp71aj groups across apiaceae . grey-colored lineages represent the apioideae subfamily and * denotes tribes within the apioid superclade. red triangle: likely origin for angelicin synthase; blue triangles: potential origins for psoralen synthase. a single partial cyp71aj has been identified in oenantha javaniva 



analyses through homology modelling indicate that the size of the active sites of the clade ii cytochrome p <dig> are smaller than the ones of clade i, with the exception of subclade i- <dig>  the steric hindrance of substrates of these enzymes is therefore likely to be smaller. unsuccessful incubations performed in the presence of various coumarins indicate that the substrates are not part of this group of molecules. a detailed analysis of the metabolome of some of these plants will allow us to focus on other potential target molecules.
