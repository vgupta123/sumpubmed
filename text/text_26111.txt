BACKGROUND
aminoacyl-trna synthetases are a group of translation enzymes, each of which catalyzes the attachment of a specific amino acid to its cognate trnas. the resultant aminoacyl-trnas are then delivered by elongation factor - <dig> to ribosomes for protein translation. typically there are  <dig> different aminoacyl-trna synthetases in prokaryotes, one for each amino acid  <cit> . in eukaryotes, protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm as well as in organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts  <cit> . thus, eukaryotes, such as yeast, need two distinct sets of enzymes for each aminoacylation activity, one localized in the cytoplasm and the other in mitochondria. each set of enzymes aminoacylates isoaccepting trnas within its respective cell compartment. in most cases, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial synthetase activities are encoded by two distinct nuclear genes. however, two saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, hts <dig>   <cit>  and vas <dig> )  <cit> , specify both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms through alternative translation initiation from two in-frame aug codons.

a previous study on cyc <dig> of s. cerevisiae suggested that aug is the only codon recognized as a translational initiator, and that the aug codon nearest the 5' end of the mrna serves as the start site for translation  <cit> . if the first aug codon is mutated, then initiation can begin at the next available aug from the 5' end of mrna. the same rules apply to all eukaryotes. however, many examples of non-aug initiation were reported in higher eukaryotes, where cellular and viral mrnas can initiate from codons that differ from aug by one nucleotide  <cit> . the relatively weak base-pairing between a non-aug initiator codon and the anticodon of an initiator trna appears to be compensated for by interactions with nearby nucleotides, in particular a purine  at position - <dig> and a "g" at position + <dig>  <cit> . a recent study suggested that components of the  <dig> s translation initiation complex, in particular eif <dig> and  <dig> s ribosomal rna, might be involved in specific recognition of the - <dig> and + <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . in addition to the sequence context, a stable hairpin structure located 12~ <dig> nucleotides downstream of the initiator can also facilitate recognition of a poor initiator by the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit  <cit> .

while the sequence context can also modulate the efficiency of aug initiation in yeast, the magnitude of this effect appears relatively insignificant  <cit> . perhaps for that reason, yeast cannot efficiently use non-aug codons as translation start sites  <cit> . nonetheless, three yeast genes, grs <dig>  genes in s. cerevisiae)  <cit> , ala <dig>  gene in s. cerevisiae)  <cit> , and carp2a   <cit> , were recently shown to use naturally occurring non-aug triplets as translation initiators. moreover, the translational efficiency of non-aug initiation is deeply affected  by nucleotides at the - <dig> to - <dig> relative positions, especially - <dig>  aaruug  appears to represent the most favorable sequence context  <cit> .

a unique feature of the gene expression of ala <dig> is that the mitochondrial form of alars is initiated from two consecutive in-frame acg codons, with the first being more robust  <cit> . redundant acgs contain stronger initiation activities than does a single acg  <cit> . this feature of recurrence of non-aug initiator codons may in itself represent a novel mechanism to improve the overall efficiency of translation  <cit> . to investigate if any other non-aug triplets can act as initiator codons in yeast, a random triplet was introduced into ala <dig> to replace the native initiation sites and screened. we show herein that except for aag and agg, all other non-aug codons that differ from aug by a single nucleotide can functionally substitute for the redundant acg initiator codons of ala <dig>  these non-aug initiator codons possessed different initiating activities and exhibited different preferences for various sequence contexts. for example, gtg, a less-efficient non-aug initiator codon in the context of ala <dig>  was one of the strongest non-aug initiator codons in the context of grs <dig>  on the contrary, ata, a fairly active non-aug initiator codon in the context of ala <dig>  was essentially inactive in the context of grs <dig>  thus, every non-aug initiator codon may have its own favorite sequence context in yeast.

methods
construction of various ala <dig> and ala1-lexa fusion constructs
cloning of the wild-type  ala <dig> gene in a low-copy-number yeast shuttle vector, prs <dig>  was previously described  <cit> . a 5'-end truncated version of ala <dig>  extending from base pairs + <dig> to + <dig>  was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction  and cloned in the xbai/xhoi sites of prs <dig>  yielding pcw <dig>  to mutate the repeating acg initiator codons of ala <dig>  a short ala <dig> sequence containing base pairs - <dig> to + <dig> was amplified by a pcr as an eagi-xbai fragment and cloned into the appropriate sites of pbluescript ii sk  . mutations were created by a pcr-based mutagenesis following the protocols provided by stratagene. the repeating acg triplets, acg/acg, were first mutated to ggt/acc to eliminate their initiating activities. a random triplet  was then introduced to replace ggt. the resultant ala <dig> fragment was recovered from the plasmid by digestion with eagi and xbai, and then ligated into the eagi/xbai sites of pcw <dig>  yielding a library of ala <dig> sequences with differences only at codon position - <dig> 

construction of various ala1-lexa or grs1-lexa fusion constructs for the western blot analyses was as previously described  <cit> . briefly, an initiator mutant of lexa was amplified by pcr as an spei-xhoi fragment and cloned in the padh high-copy-number yeast shuttle vector. a wild-type  or mutant ala <dig> sequence containing base pairs - <dig> to - <dig> relative to atg <dig> was amplified by pcr as a psti-spei fragment and was cloned in-frame into the 5' end of lexa, resulting in various ala1-lexa fusion constructs. construction of grs1-lexa fusion constructs followed a similar strategy. the expression of these lexa fusion constructs was under the control of a constitutive adh promoter  <cit> . the western blot analysis was as previously described  <cit> .

complementation assays for the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions of ala1
the yeast ala <dig> knockout strain, try <dig>  was maintained by a plasmid carrying the wt ala <dig> gene and a ura <dig> marker  <cit> . complementation assays for the cytoplasmic function of plasmid-borne ala <dig> and its derivatives were carried out by introducing a test plasmid  into try <dig> and determining the ability of transformants to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid . cultures were incubated at 30°c for 3~ <dig> days or until colonies appeared. the transformants evicted the maintenance plasmid that carries the ura <dig> marker in the presence of 5-foa. thus, only an enzyme with cytoplasmic alars activity encoded by the test plasmid could rescue the growth defect.

following 5-foa selection, a single colony of transformants was selected and grown to the stationary phase in synthetic medium lacking leucine. starting from a cell density of  <dig>  a <dig>  cultures were 5-fold serially diluted, and 5-μl aliquots of each dilution were spotted onto the designated ypg plates. the plates were incubated at 30°c for 3~ <dig> days. photos were taken of the complementation assays on day  <dig> following incubation. because yeast cells cannot survive on glycerol without functional mitochondria, the transformants did not grow on ypg plates unless a functional mitochondrial alars was generated by the test plasmid. assays of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial glyrs activities followed a similar protocol  <cit> .

reverse-transcription -pcr
to determine the relative levels of specific ala1-lexa mrnas derived from the fusion constructs, a semiquantitative rt-pcr experiment was carried out following the protocols provided by the manufacturer . briefly, total rna was first isolated from the transformants, and aliquots  of rna were then reverse-transcribed into single-stranded complementary dna using an oligo-dt primer. after rnase h treatment, the single-stranded cdna products were amplified by a pcr using a pair of specific primers. the forward and reverse primers contained sequences complementary to nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig> of ala <dig>  and nucleotides + <dig> to + <dig> of lexa , respectively. two different cycle numbers of pcr amplification were carried out for each cdna preparation as indicated in the figure. as a control, the relative levels of actin-specific mrnas in each preparation were also determined using a set of primers complementary to nucleotides + <dig> to + <dig>  and nucleotides + <dig> to + <dig>  of actin, respectively. determination of the relative levels of specific grs1-lexa mrnas derived from the fusion constructs followed a similar protocol  <cit> .

β-galactosidase  assay
yeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation at  <dig>  ×g for  <dig> s and resuspended in  <dig> μl of breaking buffer ,  <dig> mm dtt, 10% glycerol, and  <dig> mm pmsf) and  <dig> μl of beads. cells were then lysed at 4°c using a bead beater, followed by centrifugation at  <dig>  ×g for  <dig> min. aliquots of the supernatants  were diluted to  <dig>  ml with z buffer . β-gal activity assays were initiated  by adding  <dig>  ml of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside . the reaction mixtures were incubated with constant shaking at 37°c for  <dig> min and then terminated by the addition of  <dig>  ml of  <dig> m na2co <dig>  the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at  <dig>  ×g for  <dig> min, and the absorbance  of the supernatants was determined. relative β-gal activities were calculated from a <dig> readings normalized to protein concentrations.

RESULTS
screening for functional non-aug initiator codons using ala <dig> as a reporter
our previous study  <cit>  showed that two successive in-frame acg triplets  <dig> codons upstream of the atg <dig> initiator codon, i.e., acg and acg, serve as translational start sites of the mitochondrial form of alars . because examples of naturally occurring non-aug initiation are still rare in lower eukaryotes, we wondered whether any other non-aug triplet could function as a translation start site in yeast. to shed new light on this query, an in vivo screening protocol using ala <dig> as a reporter gene was accordingly designed . briefly, a short ala <dig> sequence containing base pairs - <dig> to + <dig> relative to atg <dig> was amplified by pcr as an eagi/xbai fragment and cloned in the corresponding sites of pbluescript ii sk . the repeating acg initiator codons in this short fragment were first inactivated by mutation to codons unsuitable for initiation, i.e., ggt/acc. a random triplet  was subsequently introduced to replace ggt, resulting in nnn/acc. the ala <dig> fragment containing a random triplet at codon position - <dig> was recovered from the plasmid by eagi/xbai digestion and fused in-frame to a 5' truncated ala <dig> gene , yielding a library of ala <dig> constructs with differences only at codon position - <dig> 

this library of ala <dig> constructs was transformed into an ala1- yeast strain, try <dig>  and the transformants were streaked on selection medium lacking uracil and leucine. colonies that grew on the selection medium were picked  and individually streaked on plates containing 5-foa. since the aug <dig> initiator codon of the cytoplasmic form of alars remained unchanged, all transformants that contained a full-length ala <dig> construct were expected to express the cytoplasmic enzyme and survive 5-foa selection. as it turned out,  <dig> of  <dig> transformants were able to grow on foa plates, suggesting that ~60% of the ala <dig> constructs were full length. to investigate which codon at position - <dig> has the potential to serve as a translation start site of the mitochondrial form, the growth phenotypes of the transformants that survived 5-foa selection were further tested on ypg plates. on day  <dig> following streaking,  <dig> of  <dig> transformants had grown on the plates. plasmid dnas were subsequently recovered from the "positive" clones and sequenced .

identification of non-aug initiator codons
as summarized in figure 2a,  <dig> different triplets were identified at codon position - <dig> among these positive clones, including atg, gtg, ttg, ctg, acg, att, atc, ata, cgc, and cac . it was not surprising to find that gtg, ttg, ctg, acg, att, atc, and ata were among initiator candidates, due to their close resemblance to atg, as each of these triplets differed from atg by just a single nucleotide. however, it was surprising to find that cgc and cac were also among the preliminary pool of initiator candidates. the nucleotide sequences of these two triplets are completely divergent from atg and have never previously been shown to be able to serve as initiator codons in a cap-dependent translational process in any organism. ggt served as a negative control in the assay . it should be noted that while aag and agg also differed from atg by a single nucleotide, these two triplets could not serve as initiator codons under similar conditions . perhaps this was because the middle bases in the two initiator codons and in the anticodon are all purines, and a purine pair cannot fit into an a-form helix.

to compare the initiation activities of these non-aug initiator codons, we chose lexa as a reporter. an ala <dig> fragment containing base pairs - <dig> to - <dig> was pcr-amplified from each of these positive clones and fused in-frame to the 5' end of an initiator mutant of lexa, yielding various ala1-lexa fusion constructs. these fusion constructs were expressed under the control of a constitutive adh promoter. since the initiator candidates present in the ala <dig> portion are the only available initiator codons for these fusion constructs, the relative expression levels of the alars-lexa construct are likely to reflect the initiation activities of these initiator candidates. figure 2b shows that ttg, ctg, acg, and att had the highest initiating activity, at ~50% relative to that of atg; gtg, atc, and ata had medium initiating activities, at ~20% relative to that of atg; and cgc and cac had the lowest initiating activities, at ~5% relative to that of atg . in contrast, ggt had almost no detectable initiating activity . it was interesting to note that while the cgc and cac mutants expressed ~20-fold less protein than did the atg mutant, this level of alars was still sufficient to restore the growth phenotype of the ala <dig> knockout strain on ypg plates .

to investigate whether these constructs expressed similar levels of mrna, a semiquantitative rt-pcr experiment was carried out. figure 2d shows that similar levels of cdna products were amplified from transformants carrying these constructs, suggesting that these mutations did not affect the stability of the mrnas derived from these constructs.

cgc and cac per se could not act as translation initiator codons
as cgc and cac have no resemblance to aug, it is hard to imagine that either of these two triplets can stably pair with the anticodon of an initiator trna, even with the help of an optimal sequence context, to trigger the necessary conformational changes of the ternary complex -eif2-gtp) and subsequent gtp hydrolysis. to ascertain that translation of these two ala <dig> mutants was actually initiated from cgc or cac, and not from other remedial initiation sites, codons in the leader sequence that have the potential to serve as secondary translation initiation sites and initiate the synthesis of at least part of the mitochondrial targeting sequence were targeted for mutagenesis, and the protein expression and complementation activity of the resultant mutants were then tested. in this regard, ttg appeared to be a promising candidate on account of its favorable sequence context.

to distinguish the protein forms initiated from acg and uug, an 18% polyacrylamide gel was used. as shown in figure  <dig>  mutation of acg to cgc had only a minor effect on mitochondrial activity, but drastically reduced protein expression . the upper and lower protein bands were abolished by the mutation, while the middle band was largely unaffected. this result suggests that both the upper and lower bands were initiated from acg, and the lower band was derived from cleavage of the upper band possibly by a matrix-processing peptidase. a further mutation that changed ttg to tta impaired both the mitochondrial activity and protein expression of the cgc mutant , suggesting that uug served as a remedial initiation site in the cgc mutant and the middle band was initiated from uug. as the uug codon possesses stronger initiating activity in the cgc mutant than in the ggu mutant , it is possible that cgc rescued the initiating activity of uug. note that the ttg-to-tta change is a silent mutation and therefore does not affect the stability of the protein form initiated from acg. a semiquantitative rt-pcr experiment further demonstrated that these mutations at codon position - <dig> or - <dig> did not affect the stability of the mrnas derived from these constructs .

initiation activities of various non-aug initiator codons in grs1
we next tested whether the non-aug initiator codons identified above can also act as initiator codons in grs <dig>  to this end, the native uug initiator codon of grs <dig> was substituted by the above-mentioned initiator candidates, and the mitochondrial activities of the resultant mutants were tested. as expected, mutations of ttg of grs <dig> to atg, gtg, ctg, acg, atc, or att had little effect on mitochondrial activity; transformants carrying any of these mutants grew as well as those carrying a wt grs <dig> construct on ypg plates . however, a mutation of ttg to ata yielded a construct that failed to support the growth of the knockout strain on ypg plates . also, neither cgc nor cac could act as an initiator codon in grs <dig> . tta served as a negative control in this assay .

to compare the initiating activities of these non-aug initiator candidates in the context of grs <dig>  a wt or mutant grs <dig> sequence containing base pairs - <dig> to - <dig> relative to atg <dig> was fused in-frame to an initiator mutant of lexa, and the protein expression levels of these fusion constructs were determined by western blotting. as shown in figure 4b and 4c, except for ata, the often-seen non-aug initiator candidates possessed 10%~30% initiation activities relative to that of atg . interestingly, ata expressed < 2% initiation activity relative to that of atg , which provides a rational basis for the negative growth phenotype of the ata mutant in the functional assay . additionally, it was noted that gtg, a less-efficient non-atg initiator codon in the context of ala <dig> , was one of the most efficient non-atg initiator codons in the context of grs <dig> . as expected, no detectable initiating activity was found for the cgc or cac mutant under the conditions used . tta served as a negative control in this assay . a semiquantitative rt-pcr experiment further showed that these mutations at codon position - <dig> did not affect the stability of the mrnas derived from these constructs .

initiation activities determined using lacz as a reporter
to verify whether the western blot assays shown in figure  <dig> faithfully reflect the initiation activities of the various non-aug initiator codons, we next employed a different assay using lacz as a reporter  <cit> . the lexa portion of the grs1-lexa fusion constructs was replaced by an initiator mutant of lacz, yielding various grs1-lacz fusion constructs . the β-gal activities derived from these fusion constructs were then determined. as shown in figure  <dig>  atg, ttg, acg, and atc had relative initiation activities of  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig>  , ratios which are very close to those determined by western blotting . in contrast, no discernible β-gal activity was found for the tta construct .

discussion
despite significant differences in contextual preferences and sensitivities between non-aug initiators of yeast and higher eukaryotes  <cit> , our results show that except for aag and agg, all non-aug codons that differ from aug by a single nucleotide can act as initiator codons in yeast . an obvious advantage of beginning translation at non-aug initiator codons is that these codons significantly vary in their initiation activity and are subject to regulation by the sequence context. as a consequence, they are more suitable than aug to serve as alternative translation initiation sites to modulate the relative levels of two  distinct protein isoforms  <cit> . while efficiencies of translation initiation from non-aug codons are much lower  than that from an aug triplet positioned at the same site, the alars or glyrs protein initiated from these non-aug codons was sufficient to rescue the growth defect of their respective knockout strains on ypg plates . even though protein levels of the mitochondrial form of alars can be drastically reduced, complementation functions at a fairly high efficiency. however, it should be noted that translation initiation from codons other than the often-seen non-aug initiator codons does occur in nature. for example, a cuu triplet was reported to serve as a translation start site in an insect picorna-like virus via a mechanism known as an "internal ribosomal entry site"  <cit> .

in higher eukaryotes, the sequence context can appreciably modulate the efficiency of translation initiation from aug. in contrast, in low eukaryotes, the sequence context appears to have a negligible effect on translation initiation from aug  <cit> . for example, cigan et al., reported that sequence context changes at both 5' and 3' to the yeast his <dig> aug initiator resulted in no more than a 2-fold decrease in expression  <cit> . however, recent studies argued that sequence context, in particular the nucleotide at position - <dig>  plays a critical role in non-aug initiation in yeast  <cit> . in this connection, it was interesting to point out that the non-aug initiator codons of ala <dig> and grs <dig> and the cryptic initiator codon of ala <dig> identified herein all bear a favorable nucleotide "a" at their relative position - <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, having -3a alone does not guarantee that a non-aug codon such as ata can efficiently act as an initiator codon. perhaps, the individual start codon mutations have different effects on stabilities of secondary structures around the start codon.

CONCLUSIONS
not all non-aug codons that differ from aug by a single nucleotide can act as initiator codons in yeast. in addition, a sequence context that is most favorable for a given non-aug initiator codon might not be as favorable for another. thus, it appears that every non-aug initiator codon has its own favorite sequence context in yeast.
