BACKGROUND
lactobacillus are nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria that form part of the normal intestinal microbiome in humans and animals. they are a large group of bacteria growing under microaerophilic conditions for optimal growth temperature in the range of 30–40 °c and ph  <dig> – <dig>  typically. the lactobacillus species are commonly used to manufacture fermented milk products and some of them are considered probiotics on account of their health benefits . moreover, they are “generally regarded as safe” according to the american food and drug administration due to their long history of safe use in fermented foods and their presence in the normal intestinal and urogenital microbiome of humans. the mechanisms underlying probiotic effect are generally attributed to the interaction of probiotics with other microorganisms  or with host cells . the interactions depend on the viability of probiotic cells, since it is exerted by competitive exclusion, direct inhibition of certain microorganisms involving production of antimicrobial molecules or increased growth of healthy components of the microbiota, while the interaction with the host is based on the capacity of host cells to recognize specific bacterial components or products, giving rise to response that commonly involve the immune system  <cit> .

the lactic acid bacteria influence has been described as enhancement of non-specific immunity as well as adjuvant and immunoregulatory effects in adaptive immune responses. however, the bacterial components responsible for these effects are often left unidentified. the lactobacillus bacteria show great diversity in the cell surface architecture which may influence to the physicochemical properties of the bacterial cell and strain specific properties. the cell envelope of lactobacilli is composed of the bilayer lipid cell membrane with embedded proteins anchored to the cell wall and covered by thick multilayered peptidoglycan together with lipo- and teichoic acids, pili and polysaccharides sheet. polysaccharides can either attach to the cell surface like an outer capsule and often be covalently bound to n-acetylmuramic acid of peptidoglycan or be loosely attached with it or be secreted to the surrounding environment.

the cell surface proteins are anchored to the cell wall by various mechanisms or released into the surrounding medium, where they reassociate with the cell wall through electrostatic interactions  <cit> . covalently anchored proteins can be divided into n- or c-terminally anchored proteins, lipoproteins and lpxtg-anchored proteins . n-terminally anchored proteins are involved in extracellular transport, signal transduction and protein turnover, while lipid-anchored proteins are involved in adhesion, antibiotic resistance, folding and translocation of proteins . lpxtg-anchored proteins have been demonstrated to be crucial for the interactions of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria with their hosts  <cit> . some species of lactobacilli produce an additional paracrystalline layer of proteins called as s-layer. this is a two-dimensional crystal layer consisting of 25–71 kda molecular mass proteins mainly and highly predicted overall pi value , and represent 10–15 % of the total cell protein content . the lattice symmetry of lactobacillus s-layer proteins is of oblique or hexagonal type  <cit> . the most often proposed function for s-layer is mainly reduction the ability of pathogens adhesion and invasion or reduction theirs toxins activity . some other cell surface proteins were also shown to be involved in adhesion to human intestinal cells and mucins, stimulation of cytokine secretion and mediation of co-aggregation of probiotic bacteria with pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . pili have been identified at the genome level in some lactobacilli, however only in l. rhamnosus gg polymeric structures and functionality have been characterized  <cit> . the flagella have been recognized only in twelve species of lactobacilli, and comprises flagellin, protein which is suggested to activate of signaling pathways and modulate of host immune cells  <cit> .

the other key molecules are extracellular proteins which could regulate certain signaling pathways and cellular responses, including secretion of different effector molecules such chemokines, cytokines, antibacterial peptides, mucus secretion, induction of changes in the surface properties and modulation of the immune function and the immune response of the host cells  <cit> . it is known that lactobacillus bacteria interact with epithelial cells trough several mechanisms mediated by extracellular and cell-surface-associated proteins that bind to mucus and intestinal cells  <cit> . lactobacillus adhesion to mucus involves mucus binding proteins  which in addition to the same domain organization typical for cell surface proteins share a mucus binding domain  <cit> . the mucbps  have been found among  <dig> different lactobacillus strains  <cit> . l. fermentum produced a 32 kda surface-associated protein  that is suggested to mediate adhesion to mucus  <cit> , whereas studies with l. rhamnousus gg have shown a mucus binding factor with a presumed ancillary involvement in pilus-meditative mucosal adhesion  <cit> . recent studies of l. casei bl <dig> sortase have shown that this sortase might be involved in adhesion of this strain to caco- <dig> and ht cells  <cit> . l. johnsonii has been found to produce elongation factor tu  which mediated the attachment to human intestinal cells and mucins  <cit> . the issue of lactobacilli antigens supporting probiotic action in probiotic bacteria has been extensively reviewed by lebeer et al.  <cit> , by kleerebezem et al.  <cit>  and by sengupta et al.  <cit> , however studies on the immunoreactivity of the lactobacilli molecules are sparse. in our previous studies of two structurally different exopolysaccharides isolated from l. johnsonii  <dig> and l. johnsonii  <dig>  <cit>  we have shown that both antigens differed in their reactivity with human sera. it appeared that physiological sera of healthy adult blood donors contain antibodies reactive with studied exopolysaccharides, at relatively high titers. moreover, such antibodies are also present in human umbilical cord blood sera.

the aim of this study was to identify immunoreactive proteins of four lactobacillus strains: l. johnsonii  <dig> and l. johnsonii  <dig>  l. rhamnosus lock  <dig> and l. casei lock  <dig>  the proteins immunoreactivity with  <dig> sera  was detected by sds-page and western blotting. as a result, several major immunoreactive proteins were identified.

RESULTS
the protein concentration in extracts of the studied strains was significantly different and varied, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/ ml. we observed that extraction of protein with sodium dodecyl sulfate procedure was no effective in case of l. rhamnosus lock <dig>  probably due to the presence of polysaccharide slime produced by these bacteria. thus the slime has been removed mechanically which allowed to increase the efficiency of the protein extraction by 300 %. samples were electrophoresed and stained with coomassie brilliant blue. the representative results are shown in fig.  <dig>  it could be demonstrated that proteins ranged in molecular mass from > 100 kda to about 20 kda. the profiles were quite variable, emphasizing the heterogeneity in species, however it has been shown to share several predominant bands.fig.  <dig> sds-page profile with coomassie brilliant blue staining of proteins isolated from lactobacillus strains: m – low molecular mass marker,  <dig> – l. johnsonii  <dig>   <dig> – l. johnsonii  <dig>   <dig> – l. rhamnosus lock  <dig>   <dig> – l. casei lock  <dig>  these images were cut from the same gel, merged and the appropriate scaling was used



for the analysis of immunoreactivity, protein samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. this experiment resulted in a detection of proteins reacting with analyzed sera and several delineations were revealed. in case of l. johnsonii  <dig>  there were five protein bands with the molecular mass of about  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 18 kda reacting with homologous sera , two immunoreactive protein fractions reacting with sera against l. animalis murinus  <dig> , six major protein fractions reacting with sera against l. johnsonii  <dig>  and several proteins ca.  <dig>   <dig>  30 kda reacting with sera against l. paracasei lock  <dig> . we detected a marked reaction of protein about 30 kda with sera from mouse kept under specific-pathogen-free conditions  and with mouse kept under conventional conditions , however there were no reactions with sera obtained from germ free mouse . the antibodies against protein 35 kda were detected in several human sera, namely s8-s <dig> and one umbilical cord blood serum , but the reaction was very weak. in case of protein extract from l. johnsonii  <dig> we observed several immunoreactive proteins, however homologous reactivity was blurred  and enabling determination of the approximate molecular mass. strain  <dig> produced small proteins  which reacted with other rabbit sera , and very weak with human sera . we didn’t observe reactivity with sera from mice . considering human origin species l. casei lock  <dig> we observed a broad reactivity of protein with molecular mass of about 90 kda, in particular, as the only one of the tested bacterial proteins reacted clearly with human umbilical cord blood sera . weak cross-reactivity with mouse serum has been noticed for proteins of molecular mass of  <dig> and 43 kda isolated from lock  <dig> . interestingly, six proteins of lock  <dig> and lock  <dig> have been shown to cross-react with serum against l. johnsonii  <dig> .fig.  <dig> immunoblotting of proteins isolated from analyzed strains: m – low molecular mass marker:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  kda, line  <dig> – l. johnsonii  <dig>  line  <dig> – l. johnsonii  <dig>  line  <dig> – l. rhamnosus lock  <dig>  line  <dig> – l. casei lock  <dig>  with sera: s1– rabbit polyclonal serum against l. paracasei lock  <dig>  s <dig> – rabbit polyclonal serum against l. animalis murinus  <dig>  s <dig> – rabbit polyclonal serum against l. johnsonii  <dig>  s <dig> – rabbit polyclonal serum against l. johnsonii  <dig>  s <dig> – serum from germ free mouse, s <dig> – serum from mouse living under pathogen free conditions, s <dig> – serum from mouse living under conventional conditions, s8-s <dig> sera from human healthy adults, s11-s <dig> human umbilical cord blood sera. these images were cut from the same gel, merged and the appropriate scaling was used



to identify the most immunogenic/immunoreactive proteins, electrophoretic preparation of isolated proteins from four analyzed strains was made using prep-cell apparatus  and re-analyzed in the immunoblotting assays. the representative results were shown on figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  bands with molecular mass of about 20 kda  and  <dig>   <dig>  42 kda  isolated from l. johnsonii  <dig>  one spot of 45 kda from l. johnsonii  <dig> , and two bands of  <dig> and 50 kda from l. rhamnousus lock  <dig> and also two bands of  <dig> and 50 kda isolated from l. casei lock  <dig> showing strong immunoreactivity features were cut from the gel and analyzed in lc-ms/ms. proteins were identified by comparative analysis of peptides masses  using mascot and statistical analysis. these procedures failed to obtain and identify the most reactive protein  in extract of lock  <dig>  the results of sequencing and most like homologies of isolated and analyzed proteins with spectrometric method have been summarized in table  <dig>  the highest protein sequence coverage of l. johnsonii  <dig> we observed for spot with molecular mass about 42 kda. this protein has been identified as the phosphoglycerate kinase , whereas the protein 45 kda of l. johnsonii  <dig> strain has not been identified. however, we noticed low sequence coverage  corresponded to hypothetical protein jdm1_ <dig> from l. plantarum jdm <dig>  other immunoreactive proteins of l. johnsonii  <dig> were identified as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dehydrogenase 30s ribosomal protein s <dig> and surface antigen nlp/p <dig> with  <dig>   <dig> and 48 % protein sequence coverage, respectively. spot with molecular mass of 35 kda isolated from strain lock  <dig> was identified as glyceraldehyde 3-phospahte , however a slightly lower sequence coverage  was obtained for fructose/tagatose-bisphosphate-aldolase . the 50 kda spot of lock  <dig> was characterized by a low homology with aminopeptidase c . interestingly, the immunoreactive spot with molecular mass around 30 kda isolated from l. casei lock  <dig> was identified as fructose/tagatose-bisphosphate-aldolase  while for the second analyzed protein  lower score  for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase was obtained.fig.  <dig> the sds-page profile of a separated proteins isolated from lactobacillus johnsonii  <dig> in the presence of low molecular mass marker –  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  kda by continuous-elution electrophoresis . samples are electrophoresed through a cylindrical gel. as molecules migrate through the gel matrix, they separate into bands. individual bands migrate off the bottom of the gel where they pass directly into the patented elution chamber for collection. the resulting liquid fractions  were pooled , dried and analyzed on sds-page. gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue

discussion
the unraveling of the molecular mechanisms underlying the lactobacilli biological effects is an attractive field for investigation. among the different cellular molecules, proteins might mediate certain interactions, since they would be able to interact directly with host immune system. to date, our knowledge of the identity of proteins responsible for immunomodulatory effect is very limited, although several studies have reported the interaction between lactobacilli proteins and human cells, few have been identified and characterized so far . in our studies we focused on identification of potentially immunoreactive/immunogenic proteins of four strains: two isolated from mouse  and two isolated from human  using electrophoretic, immunoblotting and mass spectrometry method. the reactivity of isolated proteins detected by sds-page and immunoblotting was heterogeneous and varied between different serum samples. the different prevalence of reactions against tested antigens in rabbit, mouse and human sera may indicate significant differences in immune system and commensal cross-talk in these group. the reason could be the way of immunization, as rabbit vaccination differs from a native intestinal stimulation of immunity, moreover rabbit immune response differs markedly from that of mice and human organism. lactobacilli as food-grade and potentially probiotic organisms with therapeutically purposes should be non-immunogenic reflected in an inability to evoke antibody responses against themselves. however it has been shown that some lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains can stimulate the production of secretory antibodies such as iga and igg. maassen et a. described that orally administered individual lactobacillus strains are able to differentially affect igg <dig> versus igg2a antibody, depending on bacteria growth phase  <cit> . prangli et al. found igg antibodies against common lactobacilli cytoplasmic proteins groel, enolase, transcription factor ef-ts and ef-tu in children with type  <dig> diabetes and coeliac disease  <cit> . in our study we also indicate immunoreactive proteins which are recognized by rabbit/mouse and human immune system and elicit an antibodies. the proteins with the highest immunoreactivity were isolated, purified and sequenced, in particular the fractions were identified as phosphoglycerate kinase, 30s ribosomal protein, surface antigen nlp/p <dig> , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , hypothetic protein jdm1_ <dig> , fructose/tagatose-bisphosphate-aldolase  and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase  and aminopeptidase c . this protein are well-known as cytosolic metabolic enzymes or translation protein and not as a surface proteins. however, over the past decade, it has become clear that many proteins have one or more unique functions over-and-above the principal biological action of the specific protein. this phenomenon is now known as protein moonlighting. the mechanism of how bacterial moonlighting proteins translocate to the cell exterior has remained unknown. they can be released from dead or damaged cells and then bind to neighboring cells, or they can be secreted onto the cell surface by an as-yet-undescribed mechanism  <cit> . most of multifunctional proteins described in literature are virulence factors of gram-positive pathogens. homologs have been also identified either cell-surface-associated and/or in extracellular space of commensal bacteria including lactobacilli. their number and moonlighting functions have significantly increased during the last five years. the identified immunoreactive glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and 30s ribosomal protein are among the most common of the commensal bacterial moonlighting proteins  <cit> . lactic acid bacteria display on the cell surface cytosolic proteins that recognize yeast mannan. the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  is involved in glucose metabolism, catalyzing the metabolism of glucose to release carbon as an energy source, however the other study shown that play important role in adhesion phenomena, or as immunomodulatory factor and recognizes human a and b blood group antigens  <cit> . studies have shown that commensal lactobacillus crispatus and several other species of the acidophilus group of lactobacillus have gapdh as major constituents of their extracellular proteome at neutral phs and that they are easily released from the cell surface into incubation buffer  <cit> . the catalytic site in the gapdh protein was suggested to be involved in the binding to colonic mucin since the binding was inhibited by nad  <cit> . extracellular gapdh of l. plantarum also binds fibronectin  <cit> . gapdh and phosphoglycerate kinase were found to be secreted to culture media by l. rhamnosus gg  <cit> . in our work we indicated that gapdh is at least one of immunogenic protein of lactobacillus johnsonii  <dig> and immunoreactive protein of l. rhamnosus lock  <dig> and suggested the importance in cross-talk between bacteria and their host. previously it was shown that gapdh of s. agalactiae is an immunomodulatory protein and that recombinant gapdh activates t and b cells  <cit> . the gapdh of s. pneumoniae was reported to be antigenic in humans as well as to elicit protective immune responses in the mouse  <cit> .

a part from immunogenic gapdh, the main immunoreactive protein 42 kda of l. johnsonii  <dig> was identified as phosphoglycerate kinase . this enzyme catalyses the reversible phosphoryl transfer between  <dig> -bisphosphoglycerate and adp to form 3-phosphoglycerate and atp, and plays a crucial role in the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway of glycolysis and in gluconeogenesis. this important role is reflected by the enzyme structure that has been highly conserved throughout evolution  <cit> . it has been shown that pgk isolated from l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis ncc <dig> plays a crucial function in regenerating atp, however in not allosteric enzyme suggesting that is not one of the key enzymes of the energy metabolism regulation of l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis  <cit> . in addition, pgk has been recognized as protective antigen against various serotype of streptococcus agalactiae and the hyperimmune sera against phosphoglycerate kinase protect neonatal animals from s. agalactiae infection  <cit> . we identified the most immunoreactive 30 kda protein of lactobacillus paracasei lock  <dig>  as fructose/tagatose- <dig> -bisphosphate-aldolase which is the fourth enzyme in glycolysis and catalyses the reversible cleavage of fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. aldolase was found in mutanolysin extract of s. pneumoniae. antibodies against aldolase protected against respiratory challenge with s. pneumoniae  <cit> . this study demonstrates for the first time that gapdh, pgk fructose/tagatose-bisphosphate-aldolase, 30s ribosomal protein, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and aminopeptidase c from gram-positive commensal strain not pathogen are able to induce the immune response and elicited antibodies.

all studied nonimmune human sera, not only of adult blood donors, but also from umbilical cord sera, contain antibodies recognizing lactobacillus casei lock  <dig> derived main protein of 90 kda. the presence of anti-90 kda protein antibodies in human sera is unclear and our studies are initiated to solve the question of the biological role of such antibodies.

interestingly, in our previous study we have shown that l. johnsonii  <dig> isolated from mouse with inflammatory bowel disease  produced polysaccharide with different structure than l. johnsonii  <dig> isolated from healthy mouse, also reflected in their immunoreactivity  <cit> . the strains varied also considerably in reactivity of their protein. this could suggest the relation of bacterial antigens synthesized by bacteria colonizing the gut with ongoing inflammatory process, especially surface antigens. the question arises whether resident strains of ibd mice could start the regulation of several proteins or production of surface antigens with specific motifs in their structure, which are absent in antigens of bacteria from the normal gut flora. this also may suggest that the antigens of lactobacilli may have an effect on host responses related to the inflammatory process in ibd.

comparison of the results showed that there was a great diversity in the immunoreactive proteins amongst the lactobacillus strains, however there were some similarities and consistencies amongst strains both within the species and across the species. in particular it may be of relevance that the presence of gapdh in mouse and human origin strains were detected as one of the reactive proteins with various sera. however, all identified proteins are common immunogenic proteins that are present in several microorganisms and could well contribute to the known immunomodulatory effect of lactobacilli.

CONCLUSIONS
during the last ten years, the number of applications developed or suggested for lactobacillus has gradually increased  <cit> . one of the fields currently studied is the development of vaccine based on lactobacilli. it has been already shown that lactobacillus increase the immunogenicity of orally administrated vaccines such as rotavirus  <cit> , polio  <cit> , cholera  <cit>  or influenza  <cit> . recently, extensively analyzed is the construction of s-layer protein for use in immunization in man or animals . the identification in our study of immunoreactive proteins opens the possibility to use them also as carries of antigens or other medically important molecules, possibly in combinations with immunostimulatory or adhesive molecules.
