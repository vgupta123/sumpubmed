BACKGROUND
copy number variants  represent a significant source of genomic structural variation. their length ranges from  <dig> bp to several megabases  and they comprise insertions, deletions, and duplications  <cit> . cnvs were initially thought to be only associated to diseases, but genome-wide screenings have clarified that they are ubiquitous and widespread in many animal genomes  <cit> .

recent studies have shown that genomic structural variations  are common among normal and healthy individuals  <cit> . they account for more differences between individuals, in terms of total bases involved, and have a higher per-locus mutation rate than snps  <cit> . understanding their distribution in the population at large is crucial in order to clarify their role in determining the phenotype and/or disease state  <cit> . in humans, several studies have attempted to characterize cnvs in populations using data from the international human hapmap consortium  <cit> , and other reference groups  <cit> . these studies have confirmed that cnvs are widespread throughout the genome and show a broad variation in their frequency of occurrence in populations. in addition they are present throughout the genomes of all taxa investigated so far: mammals  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and invertebrates  <cit> .

cnvs exist in at least two distinct, although non-exclusive, states. common cnv polymorphisms  often with multiple allelic states defined by variations in copy number and/or genomic structure; and rare cnvs, that typically lead to deletion or duplication of larger genomic segments and exist in fewer allelic states . these latter classes of cnvs are highly penetrant and short-lived in the population, either occurring de novo or persisting for only a few generations and subject to purifying selection  <cit> . while these structural variations are often benign, they can sometimes influence or even disrupt biological functions. for example cnvs have been identified as causative of a number of human diseases  <cit> .

bos taurus is one of the most important domestic animal species worldwide. it is one of the most studied ruminant models for metabolism, reproduction, and disease  <cit> . consequently, the understanding of the genetic basis of the differences in productive and functional traits in this species has great economic importance and biological significance. in this context, knowledge of the abundance and distribution of cnvs and of their association with phenotypes are of major interest. however, until now, relatively few studies have investigated cnvs in cattle  <cit> , none using a population-wide analysis. therefore, little is known about how cnvs contribute to normal phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility in cattle, compared to humans and other model organisms.

the recent focus of the research community on the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms  to assess genetic variation in cattle have promoted the use of genotyping arrays mapping to thousands of loci throughout the genome . this type of array is now easily available to scan thousands of individuals at an affordable cost, allowing cnvs to be investigated on a wide scale. compared to the higher-density of a comparative genomic hybridization array , a method that detects copy number changes at the level of 5– <dig> kb, snp arrays have the advantage of providing both normalized intensities , allelic intensity ratios  and a better estimate of the loss of heterozygosity  making cnv detection more robust. several algorithms are able to detect cnvs using the intensity of fluorescent signals from snp arrays. in this study we applied the two most commonly used and efficient ones  <cit> , as implemented in the quantisnp  <cit>  and penncnv  <cit>  software, to investigate the genome-wide characteristics of cnvs in five bos taurus breeds. we scanned the  <dig> autosomal chromosomes in a panel of  <dig> animals and identified  <dig> unique cnv candidates belonging to  <dig> regions, comparing our findings with existing publicly available information on cattle cnvs and investigated the identity and function of genes located within the duplicated regions. our results significantly enrich the current knowledge about copy-number variants in the bos taurus genome determining their distribution across the genome in five dairy and beef cattle breeds . these findings are an important resource for follow-up studies on cattle genome structure and cnv-trait association  <cit> .

RESULTS
cnv discovery and distribution
after dataset cleaning, a total of  <dig> snps from the bovinesnp <dig> beadchip were independently analysed with quantisnp  <cit>  and penncnv  <cit>  to identify cattle cnvs. after cnv calling, we identified the best bayes factor  threshold to be used by plotting the number and length of discovered cnv as a function of the bayes factor values, and used the adjusted r <dig>  obtained by qrt-pcr  as a measure of the false positive rate. since in the literature  <cit>  a bf threshold values of  <dig> is very often used and there is no evident improvement in the r <dig> value for bf values higher than  <dig>  we assumed  <dig> as the best value that minimizes false positive calling rate and maximizes cnv calling number  <cit> , thus obtaining a good confidence also for single-observed cnvs . as expected and as shown in figure 1a and 1b, the proportion of cnv length classes detected changes as a function of bf. bf measures the confidence we have in the cnv and depends upon signals arising from a number of contiguous probes. short cnvs detected by fewer probes result with low bf values, and consequently longer cnvs detected by more probes result in higher bf values. the somewhat larger than usual bf value used here therefore is unfavorable to short cnvs. by setting a high bf value we preferred to identify a lower number of short cnvs but highly confident. it should be noted, however, that the skew of distribution observed in figure 1b is consistent with several studies reported in the literature  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> individuals from five breeds were analysed. we identified  <dig> cnvs   and  <dig> cnv regions   determined by aggregating overlapping cnvs across all samples.

each individual possesses an average of  <dig> cnvs, ranging from 23kb to 4963kb with mean and median length of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively. cnv regions  include  <dig> cnvs on average and span regions with length between 53kb to 10552kb, with mean and median length of 1240kb and 782kb, respectively. furthermore,  <dig> cnvrs have an observed frequency >1%,  <dig> a frequency > 2% and  <dig> a frequency > 5%. considering all  <dig> cnvs,  <dig> of them  are homozygous deletions,  <dig>  heterozygous deletions,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are duplications with three and four copies respectively . we observed on average  <dig> cnvs per chromosome, a significant fraction of which  located in bta <dig>  chromosome, while the lowest number of cnvs  was in bta <dig> 

summary of the identified copy-number variants in the five analysed bos taurus breeds.

eleven copy-number variation regions of homozygous and heterozygous deletions and duplications  were validated by quantitative real-time pcr. these were randomly selected across eleven autosomal chromosomes. each cnv was amplified in a minimum of three and a maximum of seven specimen belonging to different breeds, for a total of  <dig> validation tests. the cnv copy number estimated by qrt-pcr was plotted against the beadchip copy number determination . linear regression analysis showed a high level of correlation  and a curve slope of  <dig>  .

the analysis of the distribution of cnv size indicates that with the bf values used less than 2% of cnvs are ≤ 100kb, 12% have a length between  <dig> and 250kb, 27% have a length between  <dig> and 500kb, 33% have a length between  <dig> and  <dig> kb, and 25% are longer than  <dig> mb. in few samples we identified cnvs about 8mb long. cnvr number and length are not significantly correlated to chromosome length. bta <dig> hosts three cnvrs, while bta <dig>  has  <dig> cnvrs, the highest value. out of the  <dig> cnvrs,  <dig> include loss-only events,  <dig> gain-only events and  <dig> include both. loss events are approximately  <dig> -fold more common than gain events in cnvrs, while the corresponding rate is  <dig> -fold for cnvs. cnvrs affected by loss events have, on average, smaller size than gain regions, in line with the recent published results of hou et al.  <cit> .

looking at the genomic distribution of cnvs within the population, they collectively span a wide fraction of the genome, ~20% of the autosomal genome , in line to what has been found in humans   <cit> . these findings prove that potentially significant portions of the genome can vary in number. there is a substantial difference in the fraction of the genome affected by common  and rare cnvs. the common ones occupy only ~ <dig> % of the genome suggesting that the bulk of the observed copy-number variations belong to the rare cnv set. there is also a different frequency distribution among cnv types . duplications and heterozygous deletions are substantially retained in the population while homozygous deletions are found only at very low frequency, generally in one or two samples. these findings suggest the existence of purifying selection in the population due to the potentially deleterious effect of homozygous deletions .

cnv association with segmental duplications and gene content
although the complete set of mechanisms responsible for generating cnvs is unknown, studies on cattle  <cit>  and other mammalian species  <cit>  highlighted an enrichment of cnvs near segmental duplications . segmental duplications, defined as genomic regions of high sequence identity  to more than one genomic locus, may mediate cnv genesis by acting as a substrate for non-allelic homologous recombination. these recombination events may result in amplification, deletion, inversion, or copy number variants. we tested whether there is a non-random association between the cnvs that we discovered and known sd regions  <cit>  and found a significant overlap:  <dig> % of the cnvs intersect with sds .

the  <dig> non-redundant cnvs found within autosomes overlap with a total of  <dig> known genes . among them,  <dig>  are protein coding genes,  <dig>  non-coding rnas , and  <dig>  are pseudogenes and retrotransposable elements. the ~ <dig> loci included in cnvs contain about 25% of the estimated total number of genes of the species . this fraction is higher than what has been reported in similar papers  but comparable with the results of the population-scale study in humans carried out by mills and colleagues  <cit> , who mapped genomic structural variations affecting more than  <dig> genes.

we used the david tool  <cit>  to analyse the gene ontology  functional categories of the protein coding genes located in cnvs . several go terms were found to be significantly over-represented . the most enriched go cellular component categories among the protein coding genes are related to ribosomal activity, with an enrichment fold larger than two . this set of genes has a limited spectrum of functions, with one-third of their go terms being related to metabolism. this is also confirmed by a kegg pathway enrichment analysis . we found a significant enrichment  in nitrogen metabolism, ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. interestingly, the same conclusion has been reached in a recent study of cnvs with next-generation sequencing in cattle  <cit> , thus suggesting that cnvs may contribute to the genetic variance of production traits in this species.

kegg pathway and gene ontology  categories significantly over represented, with false discovery rate  and gene lists .

figure  <dig> shows the comparison of our data with those obtained in similar studies available in the literature  <cit> . the four studies we considered used different approaches and different breeds and altogether detected  <dig> cnvs from less than  <dig> samples. among them, the two studies based on the same genotyping array we used   respectively detected  <dig> and  <dig> cnvs overlapping with those described here. these correspond to 52% and 36% of the cnvs detected in our study.

the other two datasets obtained by fadista et al.  <cit>  and liu et al.  <cit>  who used a cgh array, show a more limited overlap with our dataset, namely 19% and 18%. the lower overlap in these cases is very likely due to the fact that the cgh array they used has a much higher density of probes  compared to the bovinesnp <dig> beadchip . the identification with high confidence of short cnvs , even the more frequent ones  <cit> , is much harder with the illumina genotyping chip, which identifies cnvs having a distribution skewed towards large size. we also measured the percentage of overlap of the cnvs detected by us and by two other studies based on the next-generation sequencing approach  <cit> . even though the authors of these studies examined fewer samples , their more accurate methodology, at nucleotide resolution, shows a moderately higher overlap with our data . the only partial overlap of the cnvs we find with those detected in other studies can, in principle, be explained by the different breeds used here. many cnvs appear to be breed specific and may contribute to breed differentiation. on the other hand several studies  <cit>  suggest that the bulk of cnv variability is more individual than breed specific and therefore the larger number we find is most likely due to the fact that we tested a large number of individuals.

bos taurus cnv features among breeds
we looked at the differences among the five bos taurus breeds investigated: italian friesian , italian brown , italian simmental , piedmontese , and marchigiana .

among them, the italian brown shows the higher abundance of unique, single cnvs and cnvrs  , while marchigiana and italian friesian have a higher number of single and unique cnvs than the piedmontese and italian simmental . the italian brown shows the highest rate of loss events , while the piedmontese shows the lowest frequency of deletion events per sample . the italian brown and marchigiana have, on average, significantly more gain events  than italian friesian and italian simmental, but not more than marchigiana and piedmontese, probably due to the wider distribution of the latter. while italian simmental has significantly less gain events than all breeds but italian friesian . when considering the average proportion of single cnvs per cnvrs  within each breed, it can be observed that the italian brown has a more concentrated distribution , two times less sparse than the italian simmental, the piedmontese and the marchigiana . we found no significant difference in the distributions of cnv lengths among breeds, with the only exception of the italian simmental that shows a moderately lower mean and median lengths. the average number of cnvs per sample is comparable among the five breeds.

summary of the identified copy-number variants in each of the five bos taurus breeds. numbers in italics are normalized by sample counts.

the cnvs distribution among chromosomes  is, in general, homogeneous and consistent across breeds with the exception of two breeds showing a peak in cnv frequencies in two different chromosomes . in bta <dig> the percentage of cnvs in four breeds is only  <dig> % , while in marchigiana this chromosome carries  <dig> % of all its cnvs observed . the same is true for the bta <dig> where the italian simmental has  <dig> % of the cnvs  to be compared with  <dig> % for the other breeds . considering all the other cnv features , no significant difference was observed among breeds. overall this findings also suggest that differences between individuals seems to be much larger than differences between breeds.

gene ontology enrichment was computed taking into account the genes involved in cnvs for each breed. only the  <dig> genes of the italian simmental  showed functional enrichment . in particular we observed a significant enrichment for go term involved in somatotropin and prolactin/lactogen/growth activity genes caused by a single and breed-specific cnv  that contains  <dig> loci . these genes belongs to the prl family , expressed in the placenta around the first  <dig> days of gestation and are involved in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy  <cit> . prolactin genes  are known to have undergone rapid evolution in the lineage leading to ruminants  <cit>  and to be duplicated in all well studied ruminants species. the evidence presented here suggests a possible implication of this cluster in the explanation of genetic variation of production traits.

discussion
in this investigation we find more cnvs than in previous studies  <cit> . this is likely due to the large number of individuals analysed. there is also a  difference in the analysis tools that we have used, penncnv  and quantisnp, known to be more efficient  <cit> . given the high number of individuals analysed we detected a number of previously unidentified rare cnvs. it has been reported that in humans, for example, the bulk of the observed copy-number variation is present at ~ <dig> %–1% frequency  <cit> .

we cannot exclude the presence of false positives in our dataset, but the results of qrt-pcr validation of  <dig> individuals for the presence of  <dig> cnvs  suggests that the level of bf  used in favour of the detection of false positive cnvs was rather effective. only the validation reported by fadista et al.  <cit>  is comparatively equally extensive . furthermore, the number of cnvs per individual in our case averages of  <dig> , a lower value than what found in other studies . we are therefore confident that the rate of false positives we detected is reasonably low and that do not affect the overall picture.

notwithstanding the high number of samples examined and cnvs identified, we likely still haven't drawn a complete picture of cnv presence in cattle, mainly because of the limitations of the genotyping array used. we are well aware that the relatively low density of the illumina arrays with respect of other methods  make the detection of short cnvs very hard, while it is very well documented, by deep-sequencing methodologies that in homo sapiens <cit>  and more recently in bos taurus the most populated class of cnvs is that of variants shorter than  <dig> kb  <cit> . this limitation will only be partially overcome by using the more recent higher-density bovinehd beadchip . this chip, with its  <dig> bp average probe distance is ~ <dig> times less dense than the available cgh arrays and therefore would not solve the problem of incompleteness. it is unlikely that any single available technology will capture all genome structural variations and the use of multiple experimental methods  will be needed to unravel the complexity of genome variations.

CONCLUSIONS
our study presents the first population-scale description of copy number variants in bos taurus obtained by analysing data from more than  <dig> individuals belonging to five different dairy and beef breeds and using two different bioinformatics algorithms. we found that cnvs collectively span ~20% of the genome and that a significant portion of the genome is potentially subject to variation in copy number, as observed in humans. we described here the frequencies, patterns, and the potential of gene landscape impact of such cattle-specific and breed-specific cnvs. many cnvs include genes having specific biological roles, e.g. in metabolism, and are thus likely to be functional. our population scale analysis reveals that, because of their very low frequency, many cnvs are likely to arise independently, generating increased diversity among individuals and providing insight into the penetrant behaviour of cnvs in the population. this cattle cnv map provides information that complements snp information and may be added to snp-based genome-wide association and selection studies. a more comprehensive knowledge of the full landscape of bovine genetic variation permits a better understanding of ruminant biology and a further improvement of selection methods in this species.
