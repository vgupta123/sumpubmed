BACKGROUND
in mammals, long-chain acyl-coa synthetases  are necessary for fatty acid degradation, phospholipid remodeling, and production of long acyl-coa esters that regulate various physiological processes. these enzymes play a crucial role in plasma membrane phospholipid turnover in erythrocytes, via the lands pathway  <cit> , as these cells lack the capacity for de novo lipid synthesis.

in human, five acsl genes have been identified with as many as  <dig> different transcript variants for each. the two recognized transcript variants for acsl <dig>  were the only ones reported that represented spliced forms of a mutually exclusive pair of exons encoding a short highly conserved motif in the middle of the protein. all other variants differed in the amino terminus and/or the 5' utr region. whereas the detailed structure of mammalian acsl has not been reported, the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of acsl has established this motif at the proximity of the catalytic site of the enzyme, defining the entry gate for the fatty acid substrate  <cit> . this region, referred to as the gate domain, is also involved in the formation of a pocket, the "dead-end branch", in which the fatty acid is locked during the formation of the coa ester bond  <cit> . the depth and width of the pocket likely defines the substrate specificity of each of the isoforms. in the bacterial homologue, a tryptophan residue of the gate domain blocks the fatty acid channel and prevents entry of the acyl to the catalytic site. binding of atp to the nearby p-loop results in rotation of this residue and opening of the channel  <cit> . interestingly, mammalian acsls do not have this tryptophan residue and another aromatic residue, tyrosine or phenylalanine, is conserved at a different position.

for human acsl <dig>  although the region containing the gate domain is alternatively spliced, the gate domain itself is conserved. in both variants a consensus sequence can be defined as d-x4--lplah-x2-e, and we postulated that the substitution of a y  to f  residue underlies the reason for the alternative splicing of the gate-domain region. in addition to the variant originally found in erythroid cells, acsl6_v <dig>  we now have isolated  <dig> additional variants from cdna of reticulocytes: the spliced variant originally found in brain, acsl6_v <dig>  and two new isoforms, acsl6_v <dig> and v <dig>  we also identified a fifth variant, acsl6_v <dig>  present in the genbank database, which had not previously been recognized as a different spliced transcript. based on protein similarity between different members of the acsl family we hypothesized that the only known isoform of acsl <dig> was in fact one of the two possible versions of the gate domain. indeed we were able to identify and isolate from different tissues two new transcripts representing spliced variants of this domain, acsl1_v <dig> and v <dig>  we provide evidence that the two versions of the gate domain, which we define as the y- or f-gate depending on the y to f residue substitution, are evolutionary conserved. these different gate versions are present in amphibian, fish, fly, bird and plant. they can be the product of separate genes in some organisms, e.g. plants, or be obtained by an alternative switching affecting acsl <dig> and  <dig> in others, e.g. mammals.

RESULTS
five isoforms of acsl6
acsl <dig> variant  <dig> and variant  <dig>  represent spliced variants of two mutually exclusive exons . both exons code for a short motif of  <dig> residues which contain a highly conserved domain in the acsl family; d-x4--lplah-x2-e . in the description of the structure of the bacterial homologue of acsl, this region was shown to contain an entry gate for the fatty acid substrate  <cit> . therefore, we will refer to this region as the f- or y-gate domain which contains either a f or y and the two exons as ex and ex, respectively. acsl6_v <dig> was originally isolated from k <dig> cells  <cit>  and acsl6_v <dig> from brain . we isolated both isoforms from several other tissues .

we identified an additional variant form of acsl <dig>  as acsl6_v <dig> . acsl6_v <dig> lacks the first coding exon and represents a truncated amino terminus isoform. an alternative 3'-splice site appears to be present in exon  <dig> as it also lacks the second half of exon  <dig> . this alternative splicing event results in removal of a predicted membrane spanning segment. moreover, both ex and ex are skipped in this transcript variant which results in a product without the gate domain.

two new variants of acsl <dig> were identified that we propose to name acsl6_v <dig> and acsl6_v <dig> . both were isolated from reticulocyte cdna and they represent spliced variants of acsl6_v <dig> . acsl6_v <dig> lacks the first half of ex which is the least conserved region among all variants . the actual gate domain is encoded by the second half of either ex or ex. whereas a similar variation may be expected in ex of acsl6_v <dig>  we were not able to detect a truncated version of ex in a survey of  <dig> clones . ex appears to contain an alternative 3' acceptor splicing site.

acsl6_v <dig> contains an additional sequence of  <dig> bases between exon  <dig> and  <dig> as compared to acsl6_v <dig> . this element perfectly matched a portion of intron  <dig> in the genomic sequence . the insertion occurs at the 5' donor splicing site of exon  <dig>  position + <dig> of the last codon, -g/cg-. this event results in the in-frame translation of an additional  <dig> residues at position t <dig>  and restoration of the gcg codon, -g/gg-new exon-g\cg-. we propose that this element constitutes a new exon, exon  <dig> 

altogether, we have newly identified or confirmed five different forms of acsl <dig>  expressed by alternative splicing as summarized in figure  <dig> 

acsl <dig> forms dimers in the plasma membrane
as already mentioned, acsl6_v <dig> lacks the putative amino-terminal transmembrane segment that was predicted by several different analysis tools. various topology tools predict up to three transmembrane segments of acsl <dig>  but most of these models are not consistent with predictions for the other acsl isoforms and are probably not compatible with the domain organization of the protein. based on the activity of the enzyme, both the atp-binding site and the c-terminus domain need to face the cytosol. however, in several predictions, these regions would be exposed to the wrong and/or opposite sides of the membrane.

acsl6_v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> were cloned and expressed as hexahistidine fusion proteins in e. coli . despite that the predicted structure precludes a proper insertion of variant  <dig> in a membrane lipid bilayer, product of variant  <dig> was found in a membrane fraction, as was v <dig> and v <dig> product . it can be argued that acsl6_v <dig> was not inserted but associated with the membrane as was suggested for the e. coli fadd homolog  <cit>  and rat acsl <dig>  <cit> . alternatively, another region of the protein may have assured anchoring to the membrane.

when analyzed on denaturing sds polyacrylamide gel , each of the three isoforms appeared as two species of apparent molecular mass of 75â€“ <dig> kda and  <dig> kda . a slightly lower apparent molecular mass was observed for the shorter variant acsl6_v <dig>  the predicted molecular mass was  <dig> kda for variants  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> kda for v <dig>  thus, as it has been established for the bacterial homologue  <cit> , human acsl <dig> appeared to be a dimer. with a protein extract of the erythroleukaemic cell line k <dig>  an acsl <dig> antibody recognized three major species at  <dig> kda and at  <dig> kda . the two bands migrating at the expected position for a monomer probably represent isoforms of slightly different molecular mass .

identification of new acsl <dig> transcript variants
by sequence inspection of the gate-domain motifs, we noted that only two isoforms of acsl, acsl <dig> and acsl6_v <dig>  of the  <dig> known isoforms  had an aromatic residue f instead of a y . we also noted that alternative splicing of acsl <dig> resulted in a f to y substitution . given that the other conserved residues were not affected by this event, we predicted the presence of spliced variants of acsl <dig> 

in human, mouse, and chimpanzee the exon encoding the y-gate domain of acsl6_v <dig> is downstream of the exon encoding the f-gate domain of acsl6_v <dig> . the only reported acsl <dig> isoform contains the f-gate domain, coded by exon  <dig>  we identified a potential new exon encoding a y-gate domain in the intronic sequence downstream of acsl <dig> exon  <dig> of human, and exon  <dig> of mouse and chimpanzee . as described in methods, we surveyed the gate-domain motifs of human acsl <dig> by pcr cdnas from various tissues. in addition to the known acsl <dig> variant containing the f-gate domain, re-annotated acsl1_v <dig>  we identified a variant with a y-gate domain in placenta and k <dig> cells, acsl1_v <dig>  and a variant without a gate domain in cd <dig> positive cells and k <dig> cells, acsl1_v <dig> . from sequence inspection, it appeared that the other three acsl members, acsl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> can only encode a y-gate domain .

the fatty acid gate domains of human acs
an amino acid sequence comparison of the four different families of human acyl-coa synthetase proteins  revealed major differences in the gate-domain motifs. a consensus motif for short and medium chain appears to be d-x6-d-x-g-w, in which w might represent the gating residue . long and very-long chain acs shared the gate-domain motif d-x5-lpl-x-h in common but the conserved y residue  found at the - <dig> position of the lpl-x-h motif for long chain, y-lpl-x-h, is shifted to another position for the very-long chain acs, x-lpl-y-h. the conserved linker motif  <cit>  also supports the division between short-medium and long-very-long. long and very-long acs, with the exception of human lipidosin or bubblegum , contain an aspartate residue while the short and medium acs have a glycine. as previously proposed  <cit> , substitution of an asp to a gly might introduce enough flexibility in this region to allow two different conformations of the c-terminus domain. of the eleven putative acs long-chain plant homologues, two had no detectable activity and were excluded from the acs long-chain plant family  <cit> . although all eleven showed a very high degree of similarity to each other, only the nine active isoforms have gate and linker consensus motifs for long-chain . the other two lack an aromatic residue at the - <dig> position of the lpl-x-h motif and had a gly residue instead of an asp in their linker motif.

discussion
the mechanism by which short, medium, long and very-long chain acyl-coa synthetases achieve substrate specificity is poorly understood. in spite of their high degree of similarity and highly conserved structural domains, length and degree of un-saturation of the fatty acid substrates are being discriminated. of particular interest is a specific functional region in the bacterial protein that contains the so called gate domain  <cit> . in absence of atp, an aromatic residue, tryptophan, of the gate domain blocks the fatty acid tunnel and as such, the access of the fatty acid to the active site. upon binding of atp to the nearby p-loop, a conformational change induces rotation of this residue and the opening of the channel. the hydrophilic head group of the fatty acid reaches the catalytic site while the hydrophobic tail is bent into the dead-end branch. the depth and width of the pocket formed by the gate domain is a tight fit for the preferred substrates of the enzyme  <cit> . the tryptophan is not conserved in mammalian acsl. as described in this study, expression of different gates with substitutions of an aromatic residue  might achieve different gating and selectivity properties toward different substrates. measure of the substrate specificity of those membrane-bound enzymes is complicated by differences in substrate availability of the different fatty acids in the various pools in the lipid bilayer, and by the necessary utilization and/or removal of the acyl-coa product . although enzyme activities have been assessed in e. coli, we found that both human and rat acsl <dig> accumulated in inclusion bodies when over-expressed. the small fraction of proteins recovered in the lysate was purified to various degrees and assayed in triton x- <dig> micelles  <cit> . while we can measure acyl-coa formation of isoforms expressed in e. coli we refrain from defining enzymatic activity  for different fatty acids in this system, as these data would not necessarily reflect the specificity of these isoforms in the mammalian plasma membrane, and therefore not add to a better understanding of the actions of these proteins. the activated fatty acyl groups generated in the red cell membrane by acsl <dig> are bound or processed by the other proteins in the lands pathway affecting the activity of acsl <dig>  in addition, lipid-protein interactions will affect the activity of these isoforms precluding the determination of proper enzyme kinetics in an artificial detergent rich lipid environment as reported  <cit> . therefore, we argue that enzymatic characterization of the different isoforms, homo- and hetero-dimers, in the plasma membrane with proper lipid/protein and, lipid/lipid interactions affecting enzyme activity will ultimately be essential and necessary to understand the selectivity of this process in lipid and protein acylation. the characterization of the different isoforms present in a plasma membrane defines the first step in this process.

the validity to compare the bacterial homologue with the human forms is supported by the evolutionary conservation of the gate-domain motif in invertebrates and vertebrates . in mammals, two members, acsl member  <dig> and  <dig>  can produce the two different gate domains by alternative splicing. sequence inspection of the other three acsl genes, acsl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  strongly supports the prediction that they can only encode one type of gate domain, y-gate. thus, the f-gate is specific for acsl <dig> and  <dig>  the conservation of the aromatic residue, phe or tyr, in all forms of acsl supports our hypothesis that this region is structurally important to define the activity of these enzymes  <cit> .

acsl <dig> mrna was highly expressed in erythroid progenitors, cd <dig> positives cells, but it could not be detected by northern-blot  <cit>  or by rt-pcr in reticulocytes . however, it was detected in the nucleated dividing erythroleukaemic cell line k <dig>  acsl1_v <dig>  and v <dig>  were detected in erythroid progenitor cells but v <dig>  was not. acsl6_v <dig> and v <dig> were found in both precursors cells and reticulocytes but v <dig> was not. perhaps, in early stages of erythroid differentiation, acsl <dig> might have function not requiring a gate domain while acsl <dig> must have both types. acsl <dig> variant  <dig>  which lacks the gate domain and has been isolated from human testis, was not detected in the tissues we surveyed. the existence of acsl6_v <dig>  is supported by the fact that variant  <dig> of acsl <dig>  variant  <dig>  of slc27a <dig>  , and short form  <dig> of gr-lacs  <cit>  also lack the gate-domain region. moreover, an identical alternative splicing event affecting exon  <dig> was identified in cdna isolated from bone marrow of an individual with acute eosinophilic leukemia  <cit>  and a patient with atypical cml  <cit> .

in the plasma membrane of adult red cells, the function of acsl <dig> is activation of long-chain acyl groups for remodeling of lipids and acylation of proteins. in contrast, the predominant functions of acsl members found in internal membranes are fatty acid degradation and de novo lipid synthesis. not counting glycolipid species or other minor lipids, more than  <dig> different phospholipid molecular species have been characterized in the membrane of the red cell  <cit> . the different products of acsl <dig> appear to be in a dimeric state, thus formation of hetero-dimeric complexes could produce enough variety to account for the specificity and selectivity in fatty acid activation observed in this membrane. studies of the rat homologue indicate that acsl <dig> is preferentially involved in metabolism of docosahexaenoic acid, a poly-unsaturated fatty acid highly enriched in the nervous system  <cit> . we also reported that human acsl <dig> is expressed in brain tissue  <cit> , which may suggest an important role of this protein in the plasma membranes of neuronal cells that experience rapid phospholipid turnover.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified several novel forms of acyl-coa synthetase long-chain members that differ in their fatty acid gate domain, and provided evidence that swapping or deletion of this domain appears to be conserved in all mammalian acsl members  <dig> and  <dig>  we propose that a phe to tyr substitution is the structural reason for the conserved alternative splicing that affects these motifs. this mechanism may lead to enzymes with different substrate specificity necessary to maintain the complex fatty acid composition of membranes.
