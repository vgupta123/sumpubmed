BACKGROUND
the maize leaf spot caused by c. lunata have ever made tremendous yield loss of maize in  <dig> provinces of maize growing areas in china since the 1990s. especially in northern china, for instance, it occurred over  <dig> hm <dig> and led to  <dig> million kg yield loss in liaoning province in  <dig> . many research projects have been designed to discover the disease occurrence pattern, resistance breeding and integrated control of the disease. as the application of resistance varieties containing tropic and sub-tropic germplasms in large growing areas, the incidence of disease infection and its severity were declined massively and less damage was observed in field. however, in recent years, the disease has bounced back again and caused serious damages in some maize growing areas such as liaoning, anhui and henan province etc. the main cause of the disease recurrent was expected to link to large area of monoculture with same or similar resistant germplasm which then become a matrix to induce pathogen virulence variation.

c. lunata is a major organism causing the leaf spot disease in maize  <cit> , but cochliobolus lunatus as teleomorph of c. lunata is expected to form when the pathogen suffer stress condition in maize field in most cases. the teleomorph is not a major form to cause the foliar disease. c. lunata has  <dig> pathogenic types from high to low virulence in china. the distribution of pathogenic types varies in different maize growing areas. c. lunata has broad host range including maize, wheat, barley and sorghum and other grasses. meanwhile a multiple virulence factors have been demonstrated to be involved in pathogen infection to maize, such as cellulose  <cit> , non-host specific toxin -furan-2-carboxylate)  <cit> , melanin  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that some of virulence related genes have been successfully cloned in previous work such as clt- <dig> regulating non-host specific toxin production, brn <dig> being required for dhn melanin synthesis  <cit> , two mitogen-activated protein kinases  encoding genes   <cit> . previous study preliminarily showed that brn <dig> was not only involved in melanin synthesis, but also associated with toxin biosynthesis. whereas, the role of these genes in collaborated regulation of toxins and melanin production remains unknown. in addition, several novel virulence-associated genes and large suites of enzymes such as polyketide synthases  being involved in secondary metabolism were also associated with pathogenicity in most fungal pathogens  <cit> . however, there is no detailed knowledge to reveal the genetically synergistic regulation mechanism of those virulence-associated genes in the c. lunata so far.

c. heterostrophus  causing a widely distributed maize fungal disease, southern leaf blight, belongs to cochliobolus as well as c. lunatus . as the genome of b. maydis has been accomplished in recent years, it provides a great deal of bioinformation for globally understanding the detailed infection mechanism of c. lunata and its interaction mechanism with maize. based on previous work, it was found that c. lunata showed high homology with b. maydis in genetic evolution, thus c. lunata could be profiled in genome wide through comparative genome analysis. however, until now, very little information is known about developmental and pathogenic process of c. lunata from a global view, even though a normalized full-length cdna library of c. lunata was constructed in the previous study  <cit> . as we mentioned, the production of melanin and non-host specific toxin may share the common gene regulation network or overlap some node genes responsible for cross-talking between both regulation network systems. three velvet-like protein-encoding genes being interactive with brn <dig> gene were successfully screened in c. lunata by yeast two hybrid  <cit> . further work showed that velvet-like protein was involved in the regulation of pathogen pathogenicity  <cit> .

pamp  model is widely applied in a group of crops to illustrate basic immunity or mechanism of c. lunata-maize interaction. previous study showed that planting resistant maize varieties for long term in a certain areas would induce virulence variation of c. lunata and some genes served as hallmarks displaying the virulence variation, most of which are secreted protein-encoding genes. similarly a large amount of secreted proteins have been identified in b. maydis , which are responsible for specific interaction of b. maydis with maize germplasm  <cit> . taken together, it is expected that multiple virulence-associated genes control pathogen infection in host plants. although recently the functions of virulence-associated genes were characterized, the details on the relations among the expression modes of these genes still remain unclear, owing to lack of global understanding of c. lunata genome sequence. however, the global analysis on genome sequence of the pathogen c. lunata will be imperative and facilitate more rapid identification of genes responsible for pathogenicity and pathogen-plant interactions. hence, in this work, firstly the draft genome sequence of c. lunata cx- <dig> with high virulence was presented, and comparative analyses of genome repertoire among c. lunata cx- <dig> isolated from maize, c. lunata m <dig> isolated from sorghum and b. maydis c <dig> were conducted in pathogen proliferation and development, virulence and genetic variation, secondary metabolism, plant-pathogen interactions, signaling pathway and detoxification. secondly, rna-seq was applied to comparatively analyze transcriptional profiles of c. lunata ws <dig> with weak virulence and its virulence-increased variant ws18-pob21- <dig>  this work will provide abundant information for globally uncovering the infection mechanism of c. lunata to maize, thereby the new insight to the pathogen development and infection mechanism would be generated in genome wide. last but not least comparative genomic and transcriptome analysis for virulence variation of c. lunata will contribute to better understanding what is required to develop flexible strategies to control the pathogen infection.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and general features
the genome of c. lunata cx- <dig> was sequenced  with illumina sequence technology; the sequenced reads were assembled into  <dig> scaffolds  with a total size of  <dig>  mb, similar to b. maydis c <dig>  , but bigger than c. lunata m <dig>   . by mapping  <dig> unigenes to the scaffolds of c. lunata cx- <dig>  the completeness of c. lunata cx- <dig> genome was estimated to be > 99%. by prediction, c. lunata cx- <dig> genome encoded a total of  <dig> protein genes similar to c. lunata m <dig> and fewer than b. maydis c <dig> . similarly, the proportion of genes encoding secreted proteins in c. lunata cx- <dig> was  <dig> % , similar to  <dig> % in c. lunata m <dig> , but higher than  <dig> % in b. maydis c <dig>  . although the proportions of secreted proteins in the two plant pathogens were close to 7-10% in other sequenced plant pathogens such as magnaporthe oryzae
 <cit> , they were far lower than that in three insect pathogenic fungi   <cit> .table  <dig>

approximately 55% of c. lunata cx- <dig> genes have >90% of amino acid sequence identity with c. lunata m <dig> . although the sexual stages of both c. lunata and b. maydis are cochliobolus species, only about 30% of c. lunata cx- <dig> genes have >90% of amino acid sequence identity with b. maydis c <dig>  and the proportion is far lower that between m. anisopliae and m. acridum   <cit> . comparative genomic analysis showed that c. lunata cx- <dig>  c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig> have a large number of species-specific and strains-specific genes .  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> orthologous core genes and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> species-specific genes were identified in c. lunata cx- <dig>  c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig>  respectively. the proportion of species-specific genes in c. lunata cx- <dig>  was similar to c. lunata m <dig> , but far lower than b. maydis c <dig>  , showing that c. lunata cx- <dig> has more differences with b. maydis c <dig> followed by c. lunata m <dig>  in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> strains-specific genes were also identified in c. lunata cx- <dig> and c. lunata m <dig>  respectively , showing that two different c. lunata strains have distinct difference in genome. genomic islands  are part of a genome and contain at least three contiguous gene-encoding proteins that do not exist in the reference genome  <cit> . gis have many functions, especially they are involved in symbiosis or pathogenesis and may help organism’s adaptation. gis are classed into many sub-classes based on their function. for example, gis associated with pathogenesis are often called as pathogenicity islands , and gis containing many antibiotic resistant genes are referred to as antibiotic resistance islands . it was found by reciprocal analysis that c. lunata cx- <dig> has  <dig> and  <dig> gis separately in comparison to c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig>  which probably play key roles in virulence.figure  <dig>

identity analysis between orthologous proteins shows that c. lunata cx- <dig> has an average about  <dig> % amino acid identity with c. lunata m <dig>  higher than with other plant pathogenic fungi such as b. maydis c <dig> , setosphaeria turcica   and pyrenophora tritici-repentis  , especially far higher than with m. oryzae  orthologs  . therefore, c. lunata and b. maydis are more close than three aspergillus species  with an average of 68% protein sequence identity  <cit> , but more diverged than two metarhizium spp.  with an average of  <dig> % protein sequence identity  <cit> . a phylogenomic analysis revealed that c. lunata cx- <dig> and c. lunata m <dig> diverged  <dig> – <dig>  million years ago  and diverged from their most closely related maize pathogen b. maydis  <dig> – <dig>  mya . in additionally, b. maydis diverged from s. turcica  <dig> - <dig>  mya, which diverged from p. tritici-repentis 93– <dig> mya. therefore, the lineage leading to c. lunata  diverged from b. maydis  around cretaceous extinction , and the cochliobolus lineage diverged from other plant pathogenic fungi after the triassic-jurassic event   <cit> . it was also showed in figure 1c that m. oryzae and fusarium graminearum diverged 274– <dig> mya , which was much earlier than the divergence time between cochliobolus lineage and other plant pathogenic fungi.table  <dig>

pfam matches were performed to identify  <dig> conserved protein families containing  <dig> proteins in c. lunata cx- <dig> genome close to c. lunata m <dig> with  <dig> families containing  <dig> proteins and slightly lower than b. maydis c <dig> with  <dig> families containing  <dig> proteins. in phytopathogenic fungi, family expansions were identified in glycoside hydrolases , cutinases and pectin lyases compare to insect pathogenic fungi  <cit> , showing the important roles of ghs, cutinases and pectin lyases in pathogenicity of phytopathogenic fungi. as a plant pathogen, c. lunata cx- <dig> has a large number of ghs, cutinases and pectin lyases . in comparison with c. lunata m <dig>  c. lunata cx- <dig> has family expansions in transposase, fungal specific transcription factors, major facilitator superfamily, abc superfamily, cytochrome p <dig>  protein kinase, serine protease, subtilisin and glucosidase, and family constrictions in g-protein coupled receptor and heterokaryon incompatibility , which are expected to be crucial for the fungal survival in varied stress environments.

to excavate potential pathogenic genes, a blast search of the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome was performed against the pathogen-host interaction  database, which collected the experimentally proven genes affecting the outcome of pathogen-host interactions of fungi, bacteria and oomycetes  <cit> .  <dig> % of predicted genes in c. lunata cx- <dig> , identified by a blast search of c. lunata cx- <dig> genome against the phi database, are putatively related to pathogen-host interaction. the percentage of phi genes in c. lunata cx- <dig>  is close to other plant pathogenic fungi  .

transposases and repeat-induced point mutation
like rice pathogen magnaporthe grisea, c. lunata has a high degree of genetic variability and prone to form novel pathogenic variants to infect the resistant host. transposases and repetitive elements make a greater contribution to genetic instability and pathogenic variation  <cit> . the transposable elements are closely associated with the virulence of most ascomycetes including c. lunata. thus, an understanding of the change of transposons and repeat elements in c. lunata not only provides an insight into their impact on genome evolution and also contributes to shedding light on mechanisms of pathogenic variation.

the number of transposases in c. lunata cx- <dig>  was far more than c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig>  . out of  <dig> transposases in c. lunata cx- <dig>   <dig> were dna transposases,  <dig> ltr transposases and  <dig> line transposases. however, c. lunata m <dig> genome lacks line transposases. most of these transposases in c. lunata cx- <dig> are rich in dna , line  and ltr  transposases, of which subclasses such as tcmar , tad <dig> , copia  and gypsy  are much more abundant than other subclasses . transcriptome analysis also showed that  <dig> transposase genes  were up-regulated in c. lunata with higher virulence.

repeat-induced point mutation  in ascomycete fungi is a genome defense, which hyper-mutates repetitive dna and limit the accumulation of transposable elements  <cit> . rip preferentially introduces ca/g dinucleoutides to ta during the sexual cycle in many fungi, such as metarhizium spp. and trichoderma spp. etc.  <dig> paired c. lunata cx- <dig> paralogous genes showing >80% nucleotide sequence identities were used to estimate nucleotide mutation frequencies. the results showed that there was strong mutation bias: c:g to t:a , which is introduced by repeat induced point mutations   <cit> . the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome contains many transposable elements, suggesting that they can escape damage by rip.figure  <dig>

protein families involved in degrading plant cell wall and cuticle
c. lunata as a plant pathogen need to break through the passive defense  of plant for successful infection  <cit> . therefore, it would be expected to produce and secrete large numbers of extracellular degrading enzymes to degrade the plant cell wall and cuticle such as glycoside hydrolases, pectinase and cutinase, in which glycoside hydrolase  is one of the representative. the number of gh genes in c. lunata cx- <dig>  is close to c. lunata m <dig>  and the average in plant pathogenic fungi  and less than b. maydis c <dig>  , but far larger than that in three insect pathogenic fungi   <cit> . there is no distinct difference in the number of gh genes for each family except for gh <dig> and gh <dig> family among c. lunata cx- <dig>  c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig>   <dig> % of gh genes in c. lunata cx- <dig>  are identified to be putative phi genes,  <dig> % in c. lunata m <dig>  and  <dig> % in b. maydis c <dig> , which are close to the average in plant pathogenic fungi  but higher than that in insect fungi metarhizium spp.   <cit> .

plant pathogenic fungi contain almost all gh families of insect pathogenic fungi , but some gh families existing in c. lunata and other plant pathogenic fungi are not present in insect fungi, including gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> cellulases, gh <dig> xylanases, gh <dig> amylases, gh <dig> glucosylceramidases, gh <dig> and gh <dig> rhamnosidases, gh <dig> and gh <dig> glucuronidases, gh <dig> mannosidases  <cit> . the gh families of cellulases are well presented in c. lunata cx- <dig> , c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig> , including gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> cellulases. among the gh families the gh <dig> and gh <dig> cellulases are the majority, but lack of gh <dig> cellulases. gh <dig> chitinases are involved in degrading insect chitin, so predictably gh <dig> genes are less in c. lunata and other plant pathogenic fungi  than in insect pathogenic fungi   <cit> . additionally, gh <dig> family of xyloglucosyl transferases for xyloglucan catabolism play an important role in digesting plant cell walls, and they are well presented in plant pathogenic fungi including c. lunata cx- <dig> , c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig> .

protein families for transportation
in fungal transporters, atp-binding cassette  transporters and the major facilitator superfamily  are the two biggest superfamilies. the abc transporters are multi-component primary active transporters, which transport both small molecules and macromolecules under atp hydrolysis, whereas the mfs transporters are single-polypeptide secondary carriers, capable of transporting small solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients  <cit> . drug transporters of the abc and mfs transporters in plant pathogenic fungi can function roles not only in the secretion of endogenous fungal pathogenic factors such as toxins but also in protecting against exogenous plant defense compounds such as phytoalexins, thereby playing an important role in virulence to plant  <cit> . the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome encodes a great quantity of transporters  which is close to c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig>  . c. lunata cx- <dig> has  <dig> abc transporters, close to  <dig> in c. lunata m <dig> and  <dig> in b. maydis c <dig>  mfs transporters account for the highest proportion  . 60-70% of mfs transporters  and 80-85% of abc transporters  were identified as putative phi genes in c. lunata cx- <dig>  c. lunata m <dig>  b. maydis c <dig> .

in the abc transporters, the multidrug resistance  and the pleiotropic drug resistance  subfamilies function in resisting antifungal agents  <cit> . c. lunata cx- <dig> has  <dig> mdr subfamily of transporters, more than c. lunata m <dig> , b. maydis c <dig>  and the average of plant pathogens  . however, the number of pdr transporters in c. lunata cx- <dig>  is in line with c. lunata m <dig> , b. maydis c <dig>  and the average of plant pathogens . the two drug:h+ antiporter  subfamilies  of mfs transporter can make toxic compounds be secreted into outer environment  <cit> . dha <dig> subfamily of transporters well exist in the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome  . in comparison to dha <dig>  little dha <dig> subfamily of transporters are present in c. lunata cx- <dig>  as well as c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig> , however which is higher than the average of plant pathogenic fungi. these results show that there are differences in gene family expansions occurred in dha <dig>  dha <dig> and mdr among c. lunata cx- <dig>  c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig>  transcriptome sequencing of both the low virulent c. lunata strain and its virulence-increased variant showed that  <dig> transporters were up-regulated in the virulence-increased variant response to the selective pressure of host in the pathogen-plant interactions. half of these transporters  were mfs transporters including cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig> and cl <dig>  of which cl <dig> and cl <dig> were dha <dig> subfamily of mfs transporters and cl <dig> and cl <dig> were dha <dig> subfamily of mfs transporters. in the  <dig> transporters, there was only one mdr subfamily of abc transporter .

protein families for detoxification
cytochrome p <dig> enzymes  have a function with the conversion of hydrophobic intermediates of metabolisms and the detoxification of natural and environmental pollutants  <cit> . the genome sequencing of c. lunata facilitates the excavation of novel cyps from c. lunata. through the genome search against cytochrome p <dig> database  <cit> ,  <dig> p <dig> genes were identified in c. lunata cx- <dig>  more than  <dig> in c. lunata m <dig>  but less than  <dig> in b. maydis c <dig> .  <dig> subfamilies of cyps are presented in c. lunata cx- <dig> and/or c. lunata m <dig> but absent in b. maydis c <dig>  and  <dig> subfamilies of cyps are absent in both c. lunata cx- <dig> and c. lunata m <dig> but present in b. maydis c <dig>  thus showing the significant differences in cyp families expansions in these genomes. interestingly, there are a high percentage of phi genes  in the cyps of plant pathogenic fungi, for example, 112/ <dig>  in c. lunata cx- <dig>  95/ <dig>  in c. lunata m <dig> and 114/ <dig>  in b. maydis c <dig> , showing that most of cyps are involved in the pathogen-plant interactions. cyp <dig> is the biggest subfamily of p450s both in c. lunata cx- <dig> , c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig>  . additionally, cyp <dig> subfamily of p450s are present in these genomes . it was reported that cyp <dig> catalyzed the epoxidation reaction in the mycotoxin trichothecene biosynthesis of f. graminearum
 <cit> , and cyp <dig> as well as cyp <dig> were involved in the fumonisin biosynthesis of a maize pathogen f. verticillioides
 <cit> , suggesting that cyp505s and cyp65s in c. lunata and b. maydis probably be related to the toxin biosynthesis and thus play roles in fungal virulence.

virulence-associated signaling pathways
in fungal pathogenic lifestyle, g-protein-coupled receptors  are essential for plant recognition and pheromone/nutrient sensing  <cit> . they can transduce environmental signals by means of heterotrimeric g proteins into secondary messengers to regulate gene expression and ultimately cellular responses  <cit> . one gpcr of m. grisea, pth <dig>  mediates appressorium formation and virulence  <cit> . the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome contains a large number of gpcr-like genes with  <dig> in total and  <dig> putative pth11-like gpcrs, which is similar to 139/ <dig> in c. lunata m <dig> and but more than 102/ <dig> in b. maydis c <dig> . g-protein alpha subunit is a component of heterotrimeric g protein  <cit> , and activates distinct downstream effectors and influence the pathogenicity  <cit> . notably, c. lunata cx- <dig> contains four g-protein alpha subunits  that are phi genes, and it was similarly found in c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig> . the four g-protein alpha subunits showed 97% , 92% , 99%  and 61%  amino acid identities with heterotrimeric g protein alpha subunit subtype  <dig> of s. turcica , guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha- <dig> subunit protein of neofusicoccum parvum , g-alpha subunit of phaeosphaeria nodorum  and guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha- <dig> subunit of p. tritici-repentis , respectively.

likewise, three main signaling pathways , being mediated by protein kinases, control virulence-associated development of the fungal pathogen. fungal protein kinases are classed into  <dig> groups, of which ste and cmgc  kinases are involved in mapk pathway, agc  kinases in camp pathway, and cmgc , camk and agc  kinases in ca signaling pathway. the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome contains  <dig> protein kinases and it is slightly more than  <dig> in c. lunata m <dig> and  <dig> in b. maydis c <dig> and close to the average  of plant pathogenic fungi . because signal transduction plays a critical role in fungal development and infection  <cit> , most of these protein kinases are highly homologous to gene-encoded proteins from phi database  . although there are no distinct differences in the number of protein kinases in the three genomes, the function of signal pathways regulated by protein kinases in different organisms are distinct. for example, pmk <dig> mapk pathway in m. grisea is involved in pathogenesis and regulates appressorium formation, however its homologous mapk pathway in s. cerevisiae is related to both the pheromone signaling and filamentation.

s. cerevisiae has five mapk pathways such as fus <dig>  kss <dig>  hog <dig>  mpk <dig> and smk <dig>  which are involved in pheromone response, filamentous growth, osmoregulation, cell wall integrity and spore wall assembly, respectively  <cit> . m. grisea has three mapk pathways such as pmk <dig>  mps <dig> and osm <dig>  which are homologous to fus <dig> or kss <dig>  mpk <dig> and hog <dig> pathways of s. cerevisiae, respectively  <cit> . pmk <dig> pathway regulates appressorium formation, penetration and colonization; mps <dig> pathway invasive growth, conidiation and penetration; osm <dig> osmoregulation and stress response  <cit> . blastp search analysis reveals that the homologues of mapk pathways of s. cerevisiae and m. grisea were identified in the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome . the homologues of pmk <dig> and mps <dig>  clk <dig>  and clm <dig>  of c. lunata, were cloned and characterized in our previous study. clk <dig> gene influenced conidiospore formation, growth, cell degrading enzymes activity and virulence of c. lunata
 <cit> , which supported a result that homologues of pmk <dig> were essential for fungal pathogenicity in all plant pathogens  <cit> . clm <dig> gene regulated cell-wall integrity, conidiospore formation, infection, cell degrading enzymes activity  <cit> .

cyclic amp  signaling pathway was involved in the induction of appressorium formation and turgor-driven process, therefore leading to plant infection  <cit> . camp can activate downstream effectors such as camp-dependent protein kinase   <cit> . catalytic subunit  of pka was required for appressorium maturation of m. grisea
 <cit> . the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome contains two gene-encoded pka catalytic subunits , therefore proper studies of these genes will contribute to elaborating the camp signaling mediating appressorium formation.

histidine kinase  phosphorelay signaling as a major mechanism is used by some organisms  to sense and adapt to their environment  <cit> . in fungi, hk signaling mediates multi biological processes such as secondary metabolite biosynthesis, stress response, virulence and differentiation . the pathway is two-component signaling pathway containing a sensor hk and a response regulator . hks well exist in c. lunata cx- <dig> , c. lunata m <dig>  and b. maydis c <dig>  and other plant pathogenic fungi  . it’s worth noting that all hks are phi genes.

virulence-associated secondary metabolite genes
one primary goal of studying the genome of a fungal pathogen is to identify secondary metabolites that are served as virulence factors such as host specific toxins , non host specific toxin  and melanin  <cit> . the impact of hst/nhst on plant hosts was understood early, since they make the producing fungi be highly virulent to crops. c. lunata cx- <dig> is capable of producing diverse secondary metabolites such as nhst and melanin that aid in niche exploitation and pathogenicity. although toxin and melanin are two key pathogenic factors in c. lunata, the core genes for their biosynthesis are not identified in c. lunata yet. the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome provides the feasibility to identify the core genes for melanin and toxin such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  and polyketide synthase . it was reported previously that pks <dig> and pks <dig>  two pks of b. maydis c <dig>  functioned as the biosynthesis of t-toxin, and hst <dig>  one nprs of bipolaris zeicola played a key role in the hc-toxin biosynthesis. the number of core genes for secondary metabolites in c. lunata cx- <dig>  is close to the average of other plant pathogenic fungi  . the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome encodes similar amounts of nrps , pks  and nrps-pks hybrid genes   with c. lunata m <dig> . while, the numbers of nrps and pks in the two c. lunata genomes are slightly less than b. maydis c <dig> , and the latter has no hybrid. these results show that the differences in the number of nprs and pks between strains or species are consistent with their adapting to the diverse environments and hosts.table  <dig>

c. lunata cx- <dig> pkss were divided into different clusters based on phylogenetic analysis of the ketoacyl coa synthase  domain of pkss with other known pks for melanin or toxin biosynthesis as references . there were differences in the domains of different pkss in c. lunata cx- <dig> based on domain analysis, but the domains of c. lunata cx- <dig> pkss were similar with known pkss. interestingly, pkss were grouped into two kinds based on pks domain components. one kind was reducing pkss with ks, acyltransferase  and dehydratase  domains at least, including  <dig> c. lunata cx- <dig> pkss and  <dig> other known pkss being involved in different kinds of toxin biosynthesis such as alternaria alternata act-toxin, gibberella zeae zearalenone, gibberella moniliformis fumonisin, aspergillus ochraceus ochratoxin and c. heterostrophus t-toxin . the other kind was non-reducing pkss without dh domain, including  <dig> c. lunata cx- <dig> pkss and  <dig> other known pkss for melanin biosynthesis. it was suggested that c. lunata cx- <dig> has conserved pkss related to the biosynthesis of toxin and melanin. notably cl <dig> and cl <dig> both encoding pkss were up-regulated in virulence-enhanced strain. however, phylogenetic and modular analyses suggested that the protein structures of c. lunata cx- <dig> nrpss were obviously different from other known nrpss being involved in the biosynthesis of mycotoxins such as hc-toxin of cochliobolus carbonum, am-toxin of a. alternate, gliotoxin of aspergillus fumigatus and enniatin of fusarium equiseti .figure  <dig>

small, cysteine-rich peptides and effector proteins
the small cysteine-rich proteins  were secreted directly into host plant cells and perform multiple biological functions such as host recognition or colonization  <cit> , the induction of host hr , pathogenicity  <cit> , and antimicrobiosis  <cit> . some scrps as virulence effectors showed carbohydrate binding activity that not only facilitated fungal virulence by perturbing host cell signaling or interfering with host recognition of the pathogen or suppressing pathogen-associated molecular pattern -triggered immunity   <cit> , but also induced effector-triggered immunity  governed by a gene-for-gene system in plants containing homologous resistance  proteins in the pathogen-host interaction  <cit> . a recently identified class of conserved effectors in fungi are lysm effectors that contain lysine motifs  other than recognizable protein domains  <cit> . it is feasible to under-predict putative scrps in the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome due to the short length  of scrps, which contribute to extending the annotation of the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome with a specific search .  <dig> potential scrps were found in the genome, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> residues . among these  <dig> predicted scrps in c. lunata cx- <dig>  cl <dig>  with a lysm showed 34% of amino acid identity with ecp <dig> protein of cladosporium fulvum, which was a lysm-containing effector and virulence factor  <cit> . cl <dig>  containing an antifungal protein domain showed 48% of amino acid identity with an antifungal protein  of fusarium avenaceum. cl <dig>  containing a hydrophobin domain showed 45% of amino acid identity with a hydrophobin  from b. maydis. several secreted hydrophobins as fungal effectors were examined for their roles in virulence such as hum <dig> and rsp <dig> of u. maydis
 <cit> , fungal development and plant colonization such as mhp <dig> of m. grisea
 <cit> . additionally, although > <dig> residues in size of a secreted protein , it contains a lysm  and shows 42% of amino acid identity with ecp <dig>  of passalora fulva. as described above, cysteine-rich polypeptides such as cl <dig>  cl <dig>  cl <dig> and cl <dig> were served as potential candidates for pathogen effectors in c. lunata cx- <dig> 

comparative transcriptome analysis for pathogenicity variation
in the previous works, under the successive selection pressure of resistant maize germplasm, c. lunata virulence was enhanced  <cit> . although some hallmarks related to virulence variation were screened, the variation mechanism at the transcriptional level was not deeply understood yet. in order to further shed light on the molecular regulation mechanism for virulence differentiation of c. lunata, high-throughput rna-seq was performed to compare the transcriptional differences between c. lunata ws <dig> with low virulence and its virulence-enhanced variant ws18-pob21- <dig> and to further screen the crux genes that involved in the virulence variation of c. lunata under the host selection pressures.

> <dig>  million tags were sequenced for each strain and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of predicted c. lunata cx- <dig> genes were expressed in ws <dig> and ws18-pob21- <dig> respectively. however, the transcriptional profile of ws18-pob21- <dig> was different from ws <dig> after successive host direction selection . a total of  <dig> genes including  <dig> putative phi genes were significantly  up-regulated and  <dig> genes including  <dig> putative phi genes down-regulated in the virulence-enhanced strain , showing that c. lunata presented the obvious change at transcriptional regulation under the continued selective pressure from resistant host. in general, differential genes were involved in transport, oxidation-reduction process, metabolic process, mycelium development, response to stress, pigment biosynthetic process and protein metabolic process, etc., most of which were significantly up-regulated under the successive selection pressure from host. in contrast, almost all differentially expressed genes being involved in the carbohydrate metabolism, protein modification and cellular component organization were significantly down-regulated .figure  <dig>

like other plant pathogenic fungi, c. lunata could produce  <dig> -dihydroxynaphthalene  melanin and toxin as two important pathogenic factors to make plant infected. in this study, it was found that the virulence-enhanced strain produced more melanin than the wild-type strain , showing that the differential genes related to the biosynthesis of dhn-melanin were at lest partly responsible for the virulence variation under the selective pressures from host  <cit> . responses to the selective pressure of host, cl <dig> encoding scytalone dehydratase  were up-regulated phi genes and it was involved in melanin synthesis  <cit> . therefore, it was proved that the pathway of melanin synthesis was related to virulence differentiation of c. lunata. interestingly, it was found by blastp of differential genes against the proteins sequences of the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome that  <dig> flanking genes of cl <dig>  in genome were up-regulated in ws18-pob21- <dig>  including cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig> -dependent dehydrogenase), cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig> , cl <dig>  and cl <dig> . among the  <dig> flanking genes, the cl <dig>  cl <dig> and cl <dig> were phi genes . genes being involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were usually clustered  <cit> , and the combination of cl <dig> and its  <dig> flanking genes was similar to a sirodesmin biosynthesis-associated gene cluster of leptosphaeria maculans
 <cit>  and a cercosporin-associated gene cluster of cercospora nicotianae
 <cit> . thus, the  <dig> genes belonged to a gene cluster for the synthesis of secondary metabolites in c. lunata . in this cluster, cl <dig> with no expression change has 27% of amino acid sequence identity with aflatoxin regulatory protein aflr  which was involved in the regulation of aflatoxin clusters in a. flavus and aspergillus parasiticus and sterigmatocystin cluster in aspergillus nidulans, and 24% of amino acid sequence identity with cercosporin regulatory protein ctb <dig>  of c. nicotianae. cl <dig>  a mfs transporter, has 61% of amino acid sequence identity with aflatoxin efflux pump  of arthroderma otae. it was suggested that this cluster in c. lunata is a putative gene cluster for toxin biosynthesis of c. lunata. therefore, the up-regulation of the cluster genes showed that they were involved in pathogenicity variation.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we reported the first genome sequence of c. lunata, an important pathogen of maize. genome sequencing of the pathogen will make more contribution to the understanding of its evolutionary relationship with other pathogenic fungi, and efficiently screening of pathogenicity-associated genes as well as detection of its virulence variation under its interaction with host. it was showed that c. lunata cx- <dig> has significant differences from c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig> in the number and sequence of genes-encoded proteins, although their evolutionary relationships are very close. as a plant pathogen, the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome like b. maydis contains about thousands of putative phi genes  which are well known to be closely involved in the interaction with plants. additionally, it was also found that the proportion of secretary proteins in c. lunata cx- <dig> was close to that in c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig>  secreted proteins of pathogens have some crucial effectors responsible for mediating plant-pathogen interaction, some of which may play a role in the induction/suppression of plant resistance against pathogen infection  <cit> . transcriptional profile deriving from rna-seq showed that the virulence variation of c. lunata was not only related to the up-regulation of genes probably being involved in the biosynthesis pathway of toxin and melanin, it also related to the up-regulation of other pathogenicity associated genes. in other words, multiple regulatory networks involved in the virulence differentiation of c. lunata response to the selective pressures from resistant hosts.

it was found by the phylogenomic analysis that the cochliobolus lineage was diverged from other well known plant pathogenic fungi including s. turcica, p. tritici-repentis and m. oryzae, which was consistent with leonard’s result  <cit> . comparatively, cochliobolus lineage was more similar to s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis than to m. oryzae in protein sequences. a great deal of expressed sequence tags  sourced from the suppression subtractive hybridization  library of c. lunata revealed a similar trend that c. lunata has high sequence similarities with s. turcica and p. tritici-repentis
 <cit> , which would allow us more efficiently and more easily to find novel functional factors or mechanisms in c. lunata for attacking host plants. furthermore the similar resistant genes could also be searched between mentioned pathogenic fungi and applied in a way to share homologous gene sources.

a wide range of plant pathogenic fungi exhibit a high degree of genetic variability through varied ways  <cit> , based on the pamp models , in which a numerous effectors are involved in compatible or incompatible interaction between pathogen and host plants. in our case, small cysteine-rich proteins , for example, were speculated to be contributor to host immunity response if incompatible interaction of pathogen and maize resistant varieties happen, which could serve as effectors responsible for inducing host resistance response such as pti and eti  <cit> .

transposases encoded by transposons played a key role in the evolution of eukaryotic gene regulatory network, and coordinated and regulated eukaryotic gene expression  <cit> . therefore serious pathogenic variation of c. lunata was attributed to the presence of a large amount of transposases in c. lunata
 <cit> . the amount of transposases in c. lunata cx- <dig> is much larger than not only in c. lunata m <dig> and b. maydis c <dig>  also in other ascomycetes  <cit> . the phenomenon could be explained by high c to t and g to a transitions mediated by rip in the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome during its sexual cycle  <cit> , as also proved in many ascomycetes  <cit> . thus, it was speculated that shift of c:g to t:a might make the pathogen more frequently mutate in virulence differentiation of c. lunata, at least partly, suggesting that c. lunata cx- <dig> has a strong potential to evolve into other pathogenic types of strains.

c. lunata successively undergoes asexual and sexual stages in his life cycle like other fungi. so far, the asexual stage of c. lunata is well known, but its sexual stage is still poorly understood. in sexual stage, c. lunata probably survived in soil in the shape of ascospores  <cit> , but this stage was infrequent in nature. the asexual stage of c. lunata is key in causing disease to host plant. during the interaction of pathogen-plant, c. lunata and other pathogenic fungi undergo several complex and crucial steps, including attachment to the plant surface, germination on the plant surface and formation of infection structures, penetration of the host and colonization of the host tissue, which are crucial to cause disease  <cit> . pathogenic factors, including toxin, melanin, cell wall degrading enzymes , cutinase and hormone are essential for completing these processes. furthermore, many gene-encoded proteins such as gpcrs, kinases, core genes for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolite, cyps, abc transporters and mfs transporters are directly or indirectly involved in these processes. excitingly, a great many of these proteins had been identified in the c. lunata cx- <dig> genome by bioinformatics and most of these protein families were involved in the pathogen-host interaction , which facilitated the understanding of pathogenic mechanism of c. lunata. in the previous study, the chemical structure of non-host-specific toxin in c. lunata was identified successfully, and it was speculated based on the toxin structure that genes related to toxin biosynthesis may exist in genome with clustering status. it was found through the pathogen genome and transcriptome sequencing that alpha- <dig> -mannosyltransferase, epimerase, p <dig>  mfs transcripter, methyl transferase, polyketide synthase, monooxygenase and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase etc. might be members of a gene cluster and responsible for the toxin synthesis, which was a very great progress on the identification of genes related to toxin biosynthesis, even though there was no idea that those genes how to work in synergistic way so far.

although c. lunata has greatly close relation to b. maydis and both they are maize pathogens, there are distinct differences in pathogenicity-associated families. mfs transporters, g-protein coupled receptors, protein kinases and proteases families in c. lunata being involved in transport, signal transduction or degradation are expanded in relative to b. maydis. cytochrome p <dig>  lipases, glycoside hydrolases and polyketide synthases families for detoxification, hydrolysis or secondary metabolites biosynthesis are contracted compared to b. maydis, which are expected to be crucial for the fungal survival in varied stress environments.

comparative transcriptional studies for the wild type strain with low virulence and its variant with high virulence provided a global realization of gene expression response to the directly selective pressures of resistant host plants, which would contribute to better understand the virulence differentiation of c. lunata and clarify the biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites such as toxin and melanin. results suggested that toxin and melanin may share some biosynthesis related genes or regulation genes, and gene clusters for the toxin and melanin biosynthesis may overlap. nevertheless toxin and melanin were synergistic pathogenic factors to maize, which might take place in virulence differentiation induced by host selective pressures. in other words, an unknown crossovers regulation mode of toxin and melanin may govern global virulence performance. for example, brn <dig> -encoded  <dig> ,8-trihydroxynaphthalene reductase is not just involved in melanin biosynthesis but also mediates toxin biosynthesis in c. lunata
 <cit> .

although the identification of phi genes in the genome wide and pathogenicity variation analysis in transcriptome level were performed, there are still some limitations in this work. the identification of phi genes and the family classification were based on blastp search against corresponding databases. nevertheless the function of homologous genes in different organisms may be different, thus the specific function of the interested genes especially phi genes in c. lunata should be further confirmed experimentally.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report the genome sequence and comparative genome analysis, and conduct transcriptional regulation of pathogenicity variation in the plant pathogenic fungus c. lunata. the genome and transcriptome data should facilitate the identification of candidate genes and accelerate the molecular studies on biology, pathogenic mechanism and virulence differentiation of c. lunata. the candidate genes for plant-pathogen interaction are worthy of interest in c. lunata.
