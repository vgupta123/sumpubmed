BACKGROUND
teleost fish are the largest group of vertebrates comprising almost half of the total living vertebrates. in tetrapods and sharks the major histocompatibility genes are linked in a complex on a single chromosome  <cit> . in all teleosts studied so far, including salmonids, the mhc class i and class ii regions reside on different linkage groups  <cit> . extensive studies of the genomic class i region has been conducted in several fish species including rainbow trout and atlantic salmon  <cit> . the atlantic salmon and rainbow trout genomes encode one major mhc class i locus designated uba with additional non-classical mhc class i genes in two duplicated mhc class i regions  <cit> . both regions also harbour genes involved in the antigen presentation pathway, including proteosome subunits and the transporter for antigen processing. these genes all reside in the class ii region in mammals  <cit> .

genomic class ii regions are described in detail in zebrafish  <cit>  and stickleback  <cit> . in zebrafish, one class ii alpha locus and a number of class ii beta loci residing on two different linkage groups have previously been identified, where only the daa and dab loci are known to be expressed  <cit> . analysis of the functional class ii region in zebrafish showed close linkage of the daa and dab loci on chromosome  <dig>  but lack of other genes residing in the human mhc region  <cit> . in stickleback, a  <dig>  kb genomic segment contained a tandem duplicate of expressed mhc class ii alpha and beta genes, designated gaac-daa/dab and gaac-dba/dbb. in atlantic salmon, the major mhc class ii alpha and beta genes are designated daa and dab respectively. they are closely linked and cosegregate as functional haplotypes  <cit> . both the class ii alpha as well as the class ii beta chains have polymorphic alpha  <dig> and beta  <dig> domains  <cit> , although much less polymorphic than the class i alpha  <dig> domain  <cit> .

in humans, there are three classical expressed class ii loci denoted hla-dp, dq and dr. two additional nonclassical expressed mhc class ii molecules, hla-dm and hla-do, are found to control the composition of the peptide repertoire displayed by mhc class ii molecules on the cell surface of antigen presenting cells  <cit> . the nonclassical class ii molecule hla-dm regulates unloading of clip and loading of peptide onto classical mhc class ii molecules  <cit> . clip is derived from the invariant chain  and functions as a chaperone for class ii molecules as it mediates and maintains correct assembly of alpha beta dimers. hla-dm also serves as a peptide editor in early endocytic compartments  <cit> . hla-do preferentially promotes peptide loading of mhc class ii molecules that are dependent on the chaperone activity of dm, and influences editing in a positive way for some peptides and negatively for others  <cit> . in terms of polymorphism, hla-do and hla-dm are generally unpolymorphic in contrast to the three classical expressed loci hla-dp, dq and dr  <cit> .

reports on non-classical mhc class ii molecules in teleosts have so far been scarce, although sequences with low identity to their classical dab counterparts have been described in xiphophorus fishes and in the guppy poecilia reticulata  <cit> . the aim of this study was to analyse the mhc class ii situation in atlantic salmon through low stringency screening of available bac libraries using classical daa and dab probes. here we describe the genomic organization and expression patterns of two atlantic salmon nonclassical mhc class ii genes. through phylogenetic and comparative analyses we also uncover additional nonclassical mhc class ii molecules.

RESULTS
an atlantic salmon bac library  <cit>  screened at low stringency with radioactive labeled probes for mhc class iiα  and class iiβ  hybridized to  <dig> bac clones . the clones were ordered into one daa and one dab contig by restriction fragment analysis and southern hybridization. some dab positive bacs contained unstable inserts, displaying several deletions during restriction mapping. grasp hindiii fingerprint information  <cit>  confirmed our daa contig, while dab clones were placed in different contigs or identified as singletons potentially due to their unstable nature.

positive atlantic salmon bac clones from initial library screen using probes for sasa-daa and sasa-dab.

to decipher between classical daa/dab-positive bacs and other potential class ii bacs we tested both genomic dna from the library fish as well as mhc class ii positive bacs for presence of a class ii alpha minisatellite marker residing in the 3'utr of sasa-daa. classical mhc class ii alpha and beta alleles cosegregate as haplotypes in atlantic salmon  <cit>  and most haplotypes show a stable linkage between haplotype and class ii alpha 3'utr marker. the bac library fish was homozygous for a marker previously shown to segregate with the daa*0101-dab* <dig> haplotype  <cit> . none of the daa or dab positive bacs were positive for the marker, suggesting they potentially represented new mhc class ii loci while the classical mhc class ii region was not present in the bac library.

due to the confusing fingerprints analysis and deletions in the dab positive bacs, they were not considered for full-sequencing. among the daa positive bacs, clone 630n <dig> had a centered daa-positive fragment , and was thus subjected to shotgun sequencing. readings were assembled with a redundancy greater than  <dig> over  <dig>  bp . one gap in the bac clone 630n <dig> sequence still remains due to a small repeat region  eluding sequencing. the gap is located  <dig> kb in from the t <dig> end and has been verified by pcr using flanking primers.

dotplot analysis of 630n <dig> against itself showed no extended regions of local similarity . the overall g+c content of the complete sequence was  <dig> %. analysis of the complete sequence with repeatmasker unveiled  <dig> sines and  <dig> other repeats. repeat elements occupied  <dig> % of the entire genomic sequence. using a salmonid repeat-specific database, appr. 20% of the bac contained repeats  <cit> . a total of  <dig> orfs were identified within the  <dig> kb sequence where all but six had sequence similarity to transposable elements or other repeats.

linkage analysis using the 3'utr marker of classical mhc class ii gene sasa-daa and a marker identified in the 630n <dig> bac sequence showed that the two regions are unlinked with sasa-daa residing on linkage group  <dig> and the 630n <dig> marker on linkage group  <dig> .

gene content and organization
the bac encompassed six genes with homology to mhc class ii alpha, mhc class ii beta, nrgn , tiprl , tbcel  and tecta  . the mhc class ii alpha and beta related loci had low sequence identity to classical sasa-daa and sasa-dab sequences, and were thus designated sasa-dba and sasa-dbb as suggested by r.j.m.stet . the neurogranin domain family is the human homolog of the neuron-specific rat rc3/neurogranin gene. this gene encodes a postsynaptic protein kinase substrate that binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium  <cit> . the tip <dig> domain family belongs to the tor signalling pathway that activates a cell-growth program in response to nutrients in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , where tip <dig> interacts with tap <dig> and negatively regulates the tor signalling pathway. tip <dig> homologs are found in vertebrates, but very little information on its function is described. all the above mentioned genes have matching atlantic salmon ests .

only rainbow trout est matches were found for the tbcel gene . tbcel is a novel regulator of tubulin stability with overexpression causing depolymerization of microtubules and suppression resulting in an increase in the number of stable microtubules  <cit> . no perfect est match was found for tecta, but mouse tecta is expressed during early ontogeny and such libraries are not available for salmonids yet. the atlantic salmon tecta protein contained several conserved domains with identical organization to mammalian tecta molecules   <cit> . an extracellular domain  of unknown function is found in nidogen . the von willebrand factor type d domains  are blood glycoprotein domains that are required for normal hemostasis. the domain of unknown function denoted as c <dig> contains  <dig> conserved cysteine residues and is found in disease-related proteins such as von willebrand factor, alpha tectorin, zonadhesin and mucin molecules. the trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine rich domains  are found in many extracellular proteins. the zona pellucida  domain is found responsible for sperm-adhesion and is present in multidomain transmembrane proteins such as glycoprotein gp <dig>  uromodulin and tgf-beta receptor type iii.

comparison of salmonid mhc class ii sequences
the dba sequence showed 46% amino acid  sequence identity when compared to sasa-daa* <dig>  further unigene and est database searches identified one partial rainbow trout dba candidate in addition to two other atlantic salmon and rainbow trout class ii alpha-like sequences which we denoted dca and dda . amino acid sequence identity within tentative locus ranged from  <dig> to 93% across species while identity between all salmonid class ii alpha sequences ranged from  <dig> to 61% both across loci and species.

all atlantic salmon alpha  <dig> domains, except sasa-dda, contained cysteines potentially involved in formation of disulphide bridges . the rainbow trout onmy-dba and onmy-dda sequences are partial ests disrupting further comparison. a distinct feature of the sasa-dba sequence is a unique  <dig> aa insertion at aa position 41– <dig>  not seen in any of the other salmonid alpha  <dig> domains. this insertion probably influences which cysteines are involved in formation of disulphide bridges. the salmonid alpha  <dig> domains contained cysteines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> potentially involved in formation of disulphide bridges. putative n-linked glycosylation sites were found in the daa , dca  and dda  sequences, but not in the dba sequence.

the sasa-dbb locus showed 49% amino acid sequence identity when compared to sasa-dab* <dig>  full-length sequencing of the dbb-matching est clone  was performed by primer walking. rainbow trout sequences denoted onmy-dbb as locus definition name was available in genbank, but sequence identity in the beta <dig> domain suggested this may be an onmy-dab allele rather than a new locus . est database searches for other salmonid dbb-like sequences were not successful. all salmonid beta- <dig> domains contained cysteines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> potentially involved in formation of a disulphide bridge  and have a putative n-linked glycosylation site at aa 37– <dig>  the sasa-dbb sequence had an additionally n-linked glycosylation site at position 84– <dig>  the salmonid beta- <dig> domains contained cysteines at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  while the sasa-dbb sequence had an additional n-linked glycosylation site at positions 94– <dig>  looking at the cp/cyt/tm region, the sasa-dbb sequence had a  <dig> aa additional c-terminal sequence when compared to the other salmonid mhc class ii beta sequences.

in summary, atlantic salmon harbours at least two divergent mhc class ii beta sequences  and four divergent mhc class ii alpha sequences , which all share most of the characteristics typical for vertebrate mhc class ii molecules.

polymorphism and expression of atlantic salmon mhc class ii molecules
to evaluate the polymorphic content of the bac genes sasa-dba and sasa-dbb we compared exon  <dig> sequences from  <dig> unrelated atlantic salmon for both genes and to all available matching ests. one aa substitution was found in the sasa-dbb exon  <dig> , while no substitutions were found in the sasa-dba sequences. as the included sequences were derived from both norwegian as well as canadian waters, one may assume these genes have little or no polymorphism analogous to the nonclassical mhc class ii genes identified in higher vertebrates. as for sasa-dca and sasa-dda, we have not performed any extensive polymorphic studies, but based on available est information these loci contain little or no polymorphism

a common feature for all the above described salmonid mhc class ii sequences is their relatively low expression, based on hits in est databases, when compared against their classical expressed counterpart. to investigate the mhc class ii expression patterns, various tissues of unstimulated atlantic salmon were analyzed for gene expression by means of real-time pcr . foregut, hindgut, head kidney, gills, spleen, heart, liver and muscle tissues were taken from one atlantic salmon individual, where muscle represented a non-immunologically active tissue. ef1a served as the reference gene. the highest sasa-dab expression was detected in spleen, followed by gills, hindgut and head kidney. lower sasa-dab levels were observed in heart, liver and foregut with muscle showing the lowest expression levels. this sasa-dab expression pattern fits with the observations done by koppang et al.  <cit> . sasa-dbb showed highest expression in liver, followed by spleen, head kidney and heart. our dbb-matching est clone  descend from a liver cdna library, confirming the expression of this gene in liver. both macrophage and interhepatocytic cell populations have been found in liver of atlantic salmon  <cit> , suggestive of an immune function. lower sasa-dbb levels were observed in hindgut, gills and foregut with no detectable expression in muscle. sasa-dba showed highest expression levels in spleen and heart, followed by gills, muscle, hindgut, head kidney, foregut and liver. the expression patterns for the dba and dbb genes were supported with additional semi-quantitative pcr  using primers for different regions of the genes. sasa-dca showed high expression in hindgut with low expression levels in gills and liver and none in remaining tissues. hindgut of teleosts have a well recognised capacity to take up antigen  <cit> , an ability that has been related to the existence of a mucosal immune system in fish. sasa-dda showed a strikingly high expression in spleen. spleen is a central organ for antigen display and response, and a major component of the fish lymphoid system. lower sasa-dda levels were observed in heart, head kidney, gills, liver and hindgut with foregut and muscle showing the lowest expression levels. based on raw ct values, dda expression level in spleen was the only gene with an expression level comparable to classical dab expression.

based on lack of polymorphism and expression patterns deviating from their classical counterpart sasa-dab, the sasa-dba, sasa-dbb, sasa-dca and sasa-dda molecules can be classified as non-classical mhc molecules similar to mammalian non-classical hla-dm or hla-do molecules and can be involved in catalysis of peptide loading and stabilization of the classical sasa-daa/dab molecules. however, highest expression of sasa-dbb and sasa-dca in liver and hindgut respectively, and a sasa-dda expression level in spleen comparable to sasa-dab, may indicate that these molecules have a unique and yet unidentified function in these organs in salmonids.

phylogenetic analysis of mhc class ii related molecules
the phylogenetic relationship between salmon and other expressed teleosts mhc class ii sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. for mhc class ii beta, the majority of sequences cluster according to phylogeny with zebrafish, medaka, and salmon as representatives for cypriniformes, acanthopterygii and salmonids respectively . the connection between locus and expressed beta sequences are known for a few species. for medaka and stickleback, the dab and dbb represent two very similar sequences from two different loci  <cit>  suggestive of a recent gene duplication. the rainbow trout dbb sequence is published as onmy-dbb although proof of a duplicated class ii beta locus in rainbow trout is lacking. in zebrafish , authors have reported a varying number of class ii loci  <cit>  although the assumption has been that dare-daa/-dab was the major expressed molecule  <cit> . based on sequence divergence, the dare-dcb and -ddb sequences most likely represent two additional expressed zebrafish class ii beta loci. however, lacking knowledge on polymorphic content and expression profiles hinders definition of these genes as classical or non-classical. fathead minnow  contains four very divergent class ii beta sequences, but their genomic organization remains to be characterized. although difficult, some lineage-specific residues/motifs are noticeable . the acanthopterygii class ii beta sequences contain lineage specific residues such as the l <dig>  m <dig>  i <dig>  l <dig>  s <dig>  f <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> aa's motif in the cooh- end. fewer distinct lineage-spesific residues exist for the cypriniformes sequences, but the s <dig>  m <dig> or the i <dig>  i <dig> motifs are potential candidates allowing for some exceptions. cypriniformes as well as acanthopterygii sequences share a rilv motif at aa position 262– <dig> 

six teleost class ii beta sequences from zebrafish, stickleback, fathead minnow, xiphophorus and atlantic salmon  identified through a thorough database search show low sequence identity to the above described sequences. no lineage specific residues are apparent between these and the above lineages although some residues shared between sasa-dbb and ximu-dxb suggest they have a common ancestor. both these sequences share a 132– <dig> rle, y <dig> and t <dig> motif in the beta <dig> domain. the xiphophorus dxb sequence has been reported as a non-classical sequence  <cit>  while none of the other est sequences have been defined as mhc sequences in the database or in publications. identifying expressed mhc class ii molecules ease with growing number of ests available as exemplified by zebrafish. a total of  <dig>  million zebrafish est sequences are available in genbank, probably explaining why we now identify four expressed mhc class ii beta loci.

for mhc class ii alpha, the majority of sequences also cluster according to phylogeny with medaka, zebrafish and salmon as representatives for the acanthopterygii, cypriniformes, and salmonid clusters respectively . stickleback has two reported class ii alpha loci, denoted as gaac-daa and -dab  <cit> . if the third stickleback est sequence represents a third expressed locus or is an allelic version of the two reported remains to be established. as for the class ii beta sequences, zebrafish also contains at least three different expressed class ii alpha sequences most likely representing three different loci. the three different class ii alpha sequences for fathead minnow is also comparable to its four different class ii beta sequences. in addition to their classical daa sequences, atlantic salmon and rainbow trout contain three other class ii alpha sequences, which are much more divergent than the different sequences identified in zebrafish or fathead minnow. the close relationship between the sasa-dba and sasa-dca sequences suggest a common ancestral gene. if sasa-dda is a more ancient duplication of the same ancestral locus, which has evolved away from the sasa-dba and sasa-dca sequences, remains to be established. the genomic location and gene surroundings of the sasa-dca and -dda loci is currently unknown. as for the beta sequences, some lineage-specific residues/motifs are noticeable for the alpha sequences as well . the acanthopterygii class ii alpha sequences contain lineage specific residues such as the p <dig>  q <dig>  i <dig>  s <dig>  v <dig>  e <dig>  s <dig> residues shared by most sequences. lineage specific residues for the cypriniformes sequences are the d <dig>  t <dig>  p <dig>  q <dig>  r <dig>  v <dig> aa's with a few exceptions. lacking lineage specific residues for the duplicated salmonid sequences may suggest ancient duplications or different origin.

as more ests are sequenced from teleosts and we move deeper into each library, more class ii loci from more fish will most likely appear enabling a broader understanding of their origin and evolution.

genome evolution and paralagous regions
beside the major human mhc region on chromosome  <dig>  paralogous copies of genes from the mhc region have been found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which are thought to be derived from two whole genome duplications that occurred in a common ancestor of all vertebrates  <cit> . evolutionary analysis of complete genome sequences from the pufferfish species tetraodon  <cit>  and takifugu  <cit>  suggest that an additional genome duplication occurred early in the teleost lineage , close to the origin of the teleost fish themselves. all the fish of the family salmonidae apparently descended from yet another unique genome duplication event that occurred in the lineage leading to salmonid fishes 25– <dig> mya  <cit> . evidence supporting the unique and relatively "young" salmonid genome duplication event was found by studying mhc class i regions in rainbow trout  <cit>  and atlantic salmon  <cit> . here, class ia and class ib regions are found on separate chromosomes with a sequence identity of 85%  and  <dig> % , suggestive of the duplication occurring approx.  <dig> mya. two other more distant mhc class i-like genes defined as ze  <cit>  and l  <cit>  might be remnants from two of the earlier whole-genome duplication events.

the ancestral mhc must have contained both class i as well as class ii. shark and frog both contain mhc regions resembling the human mhc region containing both mhc class i as well as mhc class ii molecules  <cit> . the mhc class ii region is assumed to have been translocated to another area early in the teleost branch as teleosts are the only phylogenetic group with no linkage of class i and class ii. in contrast to teleosts, shark seems to have chosen a different paralogue as its major mhc class ii locus being more similar to the tetrapod mhc class ii molecules than to the classical teleost class ii. the salmonid dba/dca and dda sequences cluster closer to the tetrapod/shark sequences and could also be a version of this paralogue. based on the phylogenetic clustering, the salmonid dba and dca genes most likely originated from the whole-genome duplication event that occurred in salmonids  <dig> mya, similar to the class i ia and ib region duplication. dda and daa might be remnants of two older whole-genome duplication events potentially analogous to the human chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> paralogues. the human tiprl homolog  is located on chromosome 1q <dig> , a region that also encompasses mhc paralogous genes such as cd <dig> and col11a <dig>  <cit>  while the human homologs of nrgn, tecta and tbcel all reside on chromosome  <dig>  if the salmon tiprl and class ii genes originate from the primordial human chromosome  <dig> remains to be established.

other teleost genomes show some synteny to the molecules encoded on the atlanitc salmon bac clone. a tblastn search against ensembl genomic databases of tetraodon, stickleback, medaka and zebrafish  showed a tight linkage between the tbcel and tecta genes in all species except tetraodon. stickleback and medaka also harbour a tiprl homolog on the same chromosome as tbcel and tecta, although at a distance of approximately  <dig> mb and  <dig> mb away respectively. the zebrafish nrgn homolog is located on the same chromosome as tbcel and tecta approximately  <dig> mb in distance. homologs to the sasa-dbb and sasa-dba genes were not found in any other available teleost genomes. in summary, the sasa-dbb and sasa-dba genes are most likely a duplication of a primordial class ii region that has been translocated into the nrgn-tiprl-tbcel-tecta region. the duplication seems to be salmon specific although more teleost genome sequences may prove us wrong.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we describe a novel mhc class ii region in atlantic salmon consisting of two closely linked mhc class ii alpha and beta loci denoted sasa-dba and sasa-dbb respectively. the genes are not linked to the classical class ii loci and have low sequence identity to classical sequences. the region shows some conserved synteny towards other described teleost genomic regions. two additional divergent class ii alpha sequences were also identified and represent two additional salmonid class ii alpha loci. expression patterns and lack of polymorphism make these genes non-classical class ii analogues indicating that these molecules may have a unique and yet unidentified function in salmonids. in conclusion, we have identified a more complex picture for mhc class ii in teleost fishes, with most species containing multiple expressed loci. these newly discovered genes may expand our understanding of mhc class ii function in vertebrates.
