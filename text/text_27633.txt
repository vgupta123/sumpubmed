BACKGROUND
gastric mucosal defense systems assist the gastric mucosa to withstand frequent exposure to damaging factors. mucosal defense in the gastrointestinal tract includes local gastric mucosal defense mechanisms and neurohormonal regulation. the surface epithelial cells secrete mucus, bicarbonate and generate prostaglandins, heat shock proteins, trefoil factor peptides , cathelicidins, and defenses to defend against or regulate mucosal damage  <cit> . the tffs mediate mucosal repair by stimulating cell migration, inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation, and promoting the barrier function of mucus  <cit> .

among tff family, trefoil factor  <dig>  had been identified in human, mouse, rat and canine  <cit>  and was secreted by epithelial cells that associated with mucus membranes of stomach. in human gastric cancer, loss of tff <dig> expression was found  <cit> . the tff <dig> contain  <dig> amino acid residues and formed a single trefoil domain. tff <dig> orthologues from different species had 52% conserved in completely amino acid residues  <cit> . the 3-dimensional  structure of tff <dig> was resolved that contained 1– <dig>  2– <dig> and 3– <dig> disulphide bond to form a very compact structure  <cit> . tff <dig> was predominantly expressed by gastric mucosa and co-expressed with mucins in monomer, dimer and complex forms  <cit> . in the adherent mucus gel layer of normal human gastric samples, the major from of tff <dig> was about 25 kda complex form, and the dimer form of tff <dig> showed stronger association capability with mucins than monomer  <cit> . the dimer form of tff <dig> had been reported to have wound healing activity in vitro or by in vivo animal models  <cit> . the structure of tff dimeric form was determined and had significant implications for the mechanism and functional specificity of the tff proteins  <cit> .

oral trefoil factors in gastric injury rats and treatment with trefoil factors in gastric cancer cell lines showed the protection against gastric damage and promoted wound healing, respectively  <cit> . therefore, production and application of tff <dig> can be seen as a potent tool against injury of the gastrointestinal tract. recombination production of tff <dig> was reported in escherichia coli  <cit> , bacillus subtilis system  <cit> , and pichia pastoris  <cit> . there was no report about yield of rtff <dig> in b. subtilis system. in pichia pastoris secretion system, the yield was about 20 mg/l but the tff <dig> dimer form wasn’t observed. in e. coli hb <dig>  dimer forms of tff <dig> was expressed in cytosol, but the yield was low  and the purification procedure was more complicated. the b. choshinensis was suggested to be a good candidate host to express disulfide bond containing proteins  <cit> . characteristics such as low level of extracellular protease, high efficient secretion capability and proper folding of expressed proteins enable b. choshinensis expression system to be considered as a good choice for extracellular expression of disulfide bond containing proteins, such as tff <dig>  the secretion capacity of b. choshinensis was expected to simplify the purification steps to obtain rtff <dig> more easily. in this study, attempts were tried to elevate expression of recombinant human tff <dig> by e. coli cytoplasmic and b. choshinensi secretion expression systems. the expressions and biological activities were compared.

RESULTS
expression/secretion of recombinant tff1s
the transformant e. coli bl <dig>  expressed rtff <dig> in cytosol by iptg, inducing the t <dig> promoter. the optimal expression was  <dig>  mg/l at 12 h cultivation . the rtff <dig> was stably expressed for 10 h after inducer  was added. after the 10 h culture time, the more inducing time the more degradation was observed . in the b. choshinensis system, transformant b. choshinensis  expressed rtff <dig> extracellularly by using the constitutive p <dig> promoter and spsec signal peptide. tff <dig> continued to secrete and stably expressed until 5 days . the maximal expression of rtff <dig> was  <dig>  mg/l at time 108 h .figure  <dig> expression of escherichia coli bl <dig> transformants.  the sds-page analysis;  western blot analysis; and  growth curve versus expression levels. in , the 2 × ty cultured transformants were centrifuged, and the pellet proteins were resuspended in the same volume, loaded on gel and stained with coomassie blue. in , the expressed supernatant proteins at various cultivation times were loaded on tricine-sds-page, and the gel was transferred into pvdf membranes. the protein was detected with primary anti-his-tag. , the transformant was cultured and the od <dig> were measured at time intervals. the productivity of rtff <dig> was estimated by comparing the density of rtff <dig> bands to standard rtff <dig> on sds-page gels analyzed by gel-pro analyzertm version  <dig>  . the arrow mark indicates the rtff <dig> band.



purification and homodimerization analysis of rtff1
the rtff1s were purified and analyzed by sds-page. to assess the existence of dimeric tff <dig> in purified solution, glutaraldehyde was used as crosslinker to confirm the homodimeric form of protein. glutaraldehyde treatment blurred the protein band of rtff <dig> on tricine-sds-page . a significant fraction of the rtff <dig> was seen on the gel and the molecular mass was the dimeric form of rtff <dig>  the conformation of trimer and tetramer was also presented. this result indicates that intermolecular cross-linking between free thiol of tff <dig> may contribute to homodimer formation.figure  <dig> the polymerization analysis of rtff <dig> purified from b. choshinensis  or e. coli bl <dig> .  sds-page; and  native page. in , all glutaraldehyde crosslinker reaction products were subjected to sds-page analysis. the ratios of monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers were estimated by comparing the density of rtff <dig> bands to non-treated rtff <dig> as 100% by multi gauge version  <dig>  . the arrows indicate monomer and dimer forms. in , the rtff <dig> protein purified from b. choshinensis  or bl <dig>  by native ni-nta affinity chromatography was dialyzed against pbs buffer  or na2hpo4-citric acid buffer . the purified rtff1s were then subjected to 14% native page gel. the ratios of monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms of rtff1s were estimated by comparing the density of rtff <dig> bands to dtt treated band as 100% by multi gauge version  <dig>  . the dotted line indicates the mobility shift difference.



effect of acid treatment on polymerization of rtff1
to examine whether the acidic condition in the stomach affects the polymerization of rtff <dig>  the purified rtff1s were treated with different buffers  and analyzed. significant conformation differences were observed between rtff1/ec and rtff1/bc. the rtff <dig> from all sources had the same monomer protein forms prior to and after ph treatment on a native gel with reducing agent . alternatively, the rtff1/ec exhibited more tetrameric forms on native gel without dtt. the rtff1/bc exhibited monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms on native gel without dtt. pretreatment with ph  <dig>  buffer promoted more trimeric forms .

to further evaluate the polymerization pattern of rtff1s, the molecular weights of rtff1s were determined by maldi-tof mass spectrometry to compare with the observed polymerization patterns on native gel. the purified rtff1s from both sources were treated with different buffers  and examined. the different peak valleys were presented in buffers  with or without dtt treatment . the monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer polymeric forms were observed in all ph treatments’ rtff1/ec; only monomer and dimer forms were observed after dtt treating. similar results were observed on rtff1/bc, but the polymerization forms of rtff1s were monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer. the rtff1/ec exhibited more polymerization capability than rtff1/bc.

post-translational modification of the rtff <dig> secreted by b. choshinensis
the rtff1/bc is suggested to be further modified due to two observations. first, the mobility shifts between tff1/ec and tff1/bc on native gel were slightly different. second, the molecular weight of rtff1/bc analyzed by maldi-tof mass spectrometry showed that an unexpected mass increase was observed. confirmation was executed by lc-ms/ms spectrometry. an additional 162 da mass was observed in peptide sequence agseaqtetctvapr through trypsin digestion of rtff <dig>  this result indicated that o-link glycosylation occurred in the n-terminal ser residue of rtff <dig> . to identity modification of rtff <dig>  the glycoprotein sugar moieties were detected with periodic acid stain method on tricine sds-polyacrylamide gel. the result showed that sugar moieties of rtff1/bc were present . there was no sugar moiety observed in rtff1/ec .figure  <dig> the lc-ms/ms spectrometry analysis of the extra 162 da mass on n-terminal ags of rtff <dig>   bc ; and  glycoprotein stain analysis. the rtff <dig> protein purified from b. choshinensis  by native ni-nta affinity chromatography was dialyzed against pbs buffer  then analyzed by lc-ms/ms spectrometry  and confirmed by glycoprotein staining method . in , the positive control  was horseradish peroxidase and the negative control  was soybean trypsin inhibitor. the tff1/bc and tff1/ec represented rtff <dig> proteins purified from b. choshinensis  and from bl <dig> , respectively.



the rtff <dig> induced wound healing
the rtff1/ec and rtff1/bc were subjected to wound healing assays. ags cells were cultured with or without rtff <dig> for 24 h and 48 h to examine the migration of ags cells. the rtff1s of lower than 400 ng/ml concentration couldn’t significantly promote cell migration under inverted-phase microscopy  observation. the minimum concentration of 400 ng/ml rtff <dig> was recommended for the in vitro cell wound healing, and higher concentration of rtff <dig>  enhanced the capability of wound healing .figure  <dig> the wound-healing capacities assay.  wound-healing capacities; and  statistical analysis of the wound healing travel distances. in , the various concentrations of rtff <dig>  in ph  <dig>  buffer and the concentration of rtff <dig>  in ph  <dig>  buffer were added and cultured in ham’s f-12 k medium containing 10% fbs. the cell cultures were maintained at 37°c under an atmosphere of 5% co <dig>  the wound closure was monitored and photographed at  <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h with a nikon ts <dig> inverted-microscope and a nikon d <dig> camera . bc <dig>  bc <dig>  and bc <dig> represent the rtff <dig> purified from b. choshinensis  with concentrations of rtff <dig> 200 ng/ml, 400 ng/ml, and 800 ng/ml in ph  <dig>  buffer and ec <dig>  ec <dig>  ec <dig> represented the rtff <dig> purified from e. coli bl <dig>  with concentrations of rtff <dig> 200 ng/ml, 400 ng/ml, and 800 ng/ml in ph  <dig>  buffer. bc <dig>  <dig>  and ec <dig>  <dig>  represented rtff <dig> purified from b. choshinensis  or from e. coli bl <dig>  with concentration of rtff <dig> 400 ng/ml in ph  <dig>  buffer. in , all experiments were repeated four times and calculated with image j  <dig> r . each each bar represents the mean ± sd. nc <dig>  and nc <dig>  were the negative controls. the same letter represents non-significant differences of multiple comparison.



to mimic gastric conditions, purified rtff1s were treated with buffer , and then preceded the wound healing assay on ags cells. the results showed that rtff <dig> treated with ph  <dig>  buffer enhanced cell mobility, especially for rtff1/bc . measurements were made at 100× magnification. measurements of wound width were made at beginning of the experiment and after 24 h and 48 h. the mean traveled distances by various rtff <dig> added into ags cells were examined  and the data was statistically analyzed . the effects of rtff1s on ags cell migration were concentration dependent. from the statistical analysis data, the rtff1/bc showed better wound healing capability than the rtff1/ec and the ph  <dig>  treatment promoted the wound healing capability of rtff1/bc.

medium optimization of rtff <dig> secretion production
to enhance the industrial application of rtff <dig>  production of rtff <dig> was improved by various media. supplementation with mn2+ to replace the ca2+ elevated the rtff <dig> productivity in trypton-based media , but not in soytone-based medium  . the results indicated that the nitrogen source was more effective than metal ions in rtff <dig> productivity. among nitrogen sources, soytone-based media  were better than tryptone-based medium  to enhance rtff <dig> productivity; extra yeast extract improved the rtff <dig> productivity in soytone-based medium but not in tryptone-based medium . various carbon sources were tested; among the tested broths c/e/f/h/i, broth h achieved the highest secretion productivity of rtff <dig>  at 48 hr .figure  <dig> the protein yields of secreted recombinant tff <dig> protein by various culture media.  effect of metal ions and nitrogen sources; and  effect of carbon sources. the cultures were taken at time intervals and the od <dig> were measured. the productivity of rtff <dig> was estimated by comparing the density of rtff <dig> bands to standard rtff <dig> on sds-page gels analyzed by gel-pro analyzertm version  <dig>  .



discussion
in this study, human tff <dig> sequence was synthesized and cloned into expressing vector pet-tff <dig> in which the c-terminal of rtff <dig> contained his•tag. in the b. choshinensis expressing vector pncmo2-tff <dig>  the rtff <dig> was constructed in which sec signal peptide was fused in front of the rtff <dig> and his•tag sequence was in the c-terminal of rtff <dig>  these constructions were predicted to express functional rtff <dig> of molecular mass  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda in cytoplasm and extracellularly, respectively. these two vectors successfully expressed rtff <dig> in the cytoplasm of e. coli and secreted rtff <dig> extracellularly by b. choshinensis, respectively . in the e. coli system, the pet-tff <dig> expression vector was driven by the t <dig> promoter under iptg induction, and rtff <dig> was observed after two hours into the induction. the highest yield  of rtff <dig> was achieved 10 hours after induction, but the rtff <dig> was unstable and degraded into lower molecular weight fragments after 34 hours of induction. in the b. choshinensis system, continuous expression of the pncmo2-tff <dig> vector was driven by the p <dig> promoter, and secreted by spsec signal peptide. after cleavage of the signal peptide during the translocation process, the secreted rtff <dig> was observed at 12 hours in the culture medium fraction. the highest yield  of rtff <dig> was achieved after 108 hours in the culture extracellular fraction, higher than the e. coli system of this study and previously reported levels ranging from  <dig>  mg/l to 20 mg/l by e. coli  <cit>  and other systems  <cit> . in this study, the optimal expression condition of rtff <dig> by the b. choshinensis system was examined. the extracellular expression was expected to be more efficient for industrial scale-up production  <cit> .

the 3d structure of the recombinant human tff <dig> from e. coli was estimated by nmr spectra previously. a short α-helix packed against a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and three closely-packed loop structure was determined  <cit> . in another study, the structure of the disulfide-linked homodimer of human tff <dig> was indicated  <cit> . in our expression system, the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms of rtff1s were observed on sds-page gel . the percentage of monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer rtff1s from e. coli and b. choshinensis systems were about 45%, 32%, 15%, and 9% on sds-page gel, respectively. using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker can detect the existence of the correct folding and inter-disulfide bonds cross-linking between free thiol of rtff <dig> or the interactions of mere proximity of rtff <dig> 

to maintain a gel-like structure in stomach, tff1s are associated with mucins through ionic interaction, hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds; ca2+ ions enhance interaction  <cit> . the extraction from normal human gastric mucosa contained monomer, dimer, and complexes of tff <dig> and were examined to be about 12-40%, 1-4%, and 57-83%, respectively  <cit> . in our study, rtff1/ec was observed in four forms: tetramer , trimer , dimer  and monomer . the percentage was changed into about  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in tetramer, trimer, dimer, and monomer forms after ph <dig>  buffer treatment. the rtff1/bc was observed as four forms tetramer , trimer , dimer , and monomer . however, after the ph  <dig>  buffer treatment, the percentage was shifted into tetramer , trimer , dimer , and monomer . the rtff1/ec and rtff1/bc were highlighted in native gel . the more polymerization forms of rtff <dig> expressed by our expression systems were similar to native status of human gastric mucus than other expression systems reported previously. the n-terminal of rtff1/ec containing extra met residues showed more polymer forms compared to rtff1/bc. the rtff1/bc was secreted extracellularly, the signal peptide was cleaved and extra ala-gly-ser residues were left in the n-terminal. on native page gel, the rtff1/ec exhibited more mobility shifting than rtff1/bc . the molecular size of rtff <dig> was confirmed by maldi-tof spectrometry. the rtff1s in different buffers  were reduced with or without dtt treatment. the similar molecular weights of rtff1/ec and rtff1/bc had monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms, with a trace amount of pentamer form observed in rtff1/ec . the mobility shift between tff1/ec and tff1/bc on native gel was slightly different. reducing treatment with dtt exhibited monomer forms for all the rtff1s. however, different mobility shift, differences between polymeric forms of rtff1/ec and rtff1/bc on native page gel and the unexpected mass increase of rtff1/bc all indicated that other factors may contribute to the observed polymerization difference. it is possible that post-translational modification can occur on rtff1/bc. results of lc-ms/ms spectrometry and glycoprotein stained  showed that the glycosylation modification was added to the ser residue on the n-terminal of rtff1/bc.

the interaction between tffs and mucins were ph-dependent, in which viscous response was stronger in buffer ph  <dig>  than in buffer ph  <dig>   <cit> . the muc5ac mucins are secreted from ht- <dig> cells and the disulfide linkage would undergo reduction at high a ph value   <cit> . it was suggested that the hydrophobic cleft which contained conserved amino acid residues, phe <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig> and trp <dig>  between loop  <dig> and loop  <dig> of tff <dig>  provided a binding site for the ribose ring or an aromatic ring of amino acids. this intermolecular interaction would be formed with ligands or receptors  <cit> . in low ph conditions, the structure of tff <dig> was more stacked through three pairs of disulfide bonds and this conformation may be more prone to protein-protein interaction through hydrophobic cleft interaction and hydrogen bonds. as seen in rtff <dig> treated with dtt in ph  <dig>  or  <dig>  buffers, only monomer forms were present on native gel .

the concentration of total monomeric, dimeric and complex tff <dig> from normal human gastric antral mucosa is about  <dig>  to 13 μg/mg ,which is approximately  <dig> -1% of total mucosal proteins  <cit> . in wound healing assays, added tffs could promote cell migration but there was no effect on cell proliferation  <cit> . in cell line assays, the concentration of tffs was about  <dig>  nm to  <dig>  μm levels that had an effect on in vitro wound healing assays  <cit> . the effective concentration of in vivo wound healing assay was about  <dig>  nmol/kg  <cit> . in this study, the concentrations of  <dig> nm rtff <dig> in medium had an effect on cell migration. the rtff1/bc showed more promoted moving after ph  <dig>  buffer pretreatment than the ph  <dig>  buffer treatment rtff <dig> . on the other hand, the rtff1/ec showed less capability of wound healing and did not exhibit enhancing capability after the ph  <dig>  buffer pretreatment . the extra n-terminal sequence of rtff1/bc was not involved in the trefoil factor functional domain, but glycosylation modification might enhance the interaction of cell surface receptors or mucins with rtff <dig>  as compared to rtff1/ec. the rtff1/bc would likely be prone to associate to form more polymeric rtff <dig> after the ph  <dig>  treatment, and more efficiency interact with surface receptors or mucins. therefore, a better wound healing capacity of rtff1/bc was achieved than that of the rtff1/ec. the rtff1/bc in this study was expected to be more effective in stomach acidic conditions. previously, glycosylated tff <dig> in the stomach is the only tff which had reported in vivo functional significance  <cit> . the o-linked serine rich glycoprotein was suggested to play a role in bacterial pathogenesis adhesion  <cit> . in this study, o-linked glycosylated rtff <dig> exhibited better wound healing capacity which is a novel finding. to our knowledge, this is also the first report concerning o-linked glycoprotein which was secreted extracellularly by bacillus or brevibacillus species.

to improve rtff <dig> secretion productivity, various media were tested to optimize yields. all the growth curves of b. choshinensis transformant cultured by various media were similar. in figure 6a, the effects of metal ions and nitrogen sources were examined. it has been reported that metal ions play an important role in maintaining cell formation, metabolism and enzyme production and stability  <cit> . supplements of mn2+ instead of ca2+ elevated rtff <dig> protein secretion production only in the soytone-based medium ; supplements of the extra yeast extract  covered the effect of metal ions. in the trypton-based medium, the effect of ions weren’t significant. the broth g supplement with extra yeast extract showed better productivity at 48 hrs of culturing. results suggested that a nitrogen source was more effective than metal ions in rtff <dig> productivity. among nitrogen sources, soytone based media  were better than tryptone-based media  in improving rtff <dig> productivity; the extra yeast extract  improved rtff <dig> productivity  . it is a safer and more effective choice of soytone as a nitrogen source to avoid undesirable contaminants such as prions from animal nitrogen sources. therefore, a medium composed of plant resource soytone and 15 g/l yeast extract was used to examine the effect of carbon sources. figure 6b shows that sucrose, soluble starch, and glucose did not affect the growth of b. choshinensis transformant but affected the secretion of rtff <dig> at various levels and time points. broth h with higher glucose content  achieved the highest secretion productivity of rtff <dig>  at 48 hr of culturing; enhanced productivity and less culture time to achieve optimal production were both achieved.

CONCLUSIONS
high levels extracellular production of recombinant human trefoil factor  <dig>  were achieved by b. choshinensis, superior to that of e. coli. the rtff <dig> purified from b. choshinensis was unexpectedly glycosylated at the n-terminal serine residue and enhanced wound healing capacity. the rtff <dig> purified from b. choshinensis also promoted better wound healing capacity after the ph  <dig>  buffer treatment; this character suggests effective application potency in stomach acid conditions. the extracellular production by the b. choshinensis system was suggested to facilitate industrial production as well as ease of downstream processing. production of active eukaryotic proteins through bacterial expression systems still remains “an art”  <cit> . this study provides a potent tool for producing recombinant human trefoil factor  <dig> to apply to gastric injury damage protection and wound healing.
