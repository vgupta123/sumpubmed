BACKGROUND
temperature fluctuations during the growing seasons of a crop critically affect plant development and adversely influence the crop production  <cit> . for example at seedling stage, chilling temperatures slow down growth, generally as a result of reduced enzymatic activities  <cit> , while high temperatures can accelerate growth but with longer exposure has detrimental effects on viability and growth  <cit> . high temperature stresses induces reactive oxygen species  production, resulting in oxidative damage and cell death  <cit> . impacts of thermal stresses reinforce the need to understand how underlying genetic variation affects the response of major crops to a range of thermal stress, and how genetic diversity can be utilized to develop germplasm with greater fitness against temperature fluctuations.

the introduction and breeding of traits for improved tolerance to abiotic stress is of continuous interest in cereal crops such as sorghum, maize, wheat, and barley for the purposes of sustained production. this has become more necessary in a cereal crop such as sorghum, which is likely cultivated under marginal conditions and thermal stresses. improving cold stress tolerance in sorghum seedlings will be advantageous for early-season planting and to provide robust stand establishment, whereas heat tolerance can improve the survivability of seedlings during periodic high temperature that occurs in the regular planting season in the us sorghum belt.

cool ambient air and soil temperatures are major abiotic stressors affecting plant growth and development, and are of great importance in northern latitudes such as usa, europe and china. cold stress is known to induce the biosynthesis of flavonoids, anthocyanins, and phenyl-propanoids  <cit> . anthocyanin content in leaf was reported to be positively correlated with cold tolerance in some arabidopsis ecotypes  <cit> . higher levels of anthocyanin, proposed as the blue light absorbing flavonols in the leaf, ensure that chlorophyll is not over-excited under extreme conditions of cold , suggesting role of anthocyanin as defense machinery against the cold-induced damage. in sorghum, variation for cold tolerance at genetic level is being evaluated through bi-parental mapping  <cit>  and association mapping approaches  <cit> . however, the link between cold response and anthocyanin level in sorghum has not been explored to date.

similarly, heat stress limits the growth and development of sorghum seedling at high temperature  by further inhibiting photosynthesis  <cit> . a short period of heat stress is sufficient to provoke severe cellular injury. chlorophyll synthesis is sensitive to heat stress and is an indicator of heat-stress induced injury. in plants, heat is a major abiotic instigator for the accumulation of ros, which are detrimental to plant cells causing damage to valuable biomolecules like sugars, lipids, and membranes  <cit> . heat tolerant cultivars would be a key improvement for breeding programs to address the adverse effects of abiotic stress on crops  <cit> . variation for tolerance to heat stress is observed in sorghum but this remains to be analyzed for use in selection and breeding.

both cold and heat tolerance are complex quantitative traits, involving multiple regulatory gene mechanisms and metabolic pathways. therefore, it is important to analyze primary or secondary metabolites along with the morphological and physiological traits such as seedling weight and length that varies with thermal stress conditions. in corn, association studies using seedling traits and chlorophyll phenotypic evaluations were performed in panels to identify qtl and snp that conditions cold tolerance in seedlings  <cit> . further, genetic and molecular basis for cold and heat tolerance traits are necessary to understand the mechanisms and gene regulatory networks underlying tolerance traits at seedling stages in sorghum.

understanding such complex and coordinated networks requires an establishment of genomic resources for abiotic stress tolerance traits using integrated genomics approach of associating mapping, bi-parental mapping and expression analysis. whole-transcriptome sequencing can help in constructing putative transcriptional networks; and few studies in sorghum have elucidated differential expression patterns under cold  <cit> , drought  <cit> , and nitrogen stress  <cit> . genome-wide gene expression analysis has recently aided in dissecting the impacts of abiotic stress at the molecular level. however, the high abundance of the differentially expressed genes makes it harder to find most critical genes involved in stress defense for a particular genotype. thus knowledge of the impact of genetic variation on stress response can be improved by combining prior molecular information through genetics  in combination with transcriptional networks generated from rnaseq data.

in sorghum, association mapping has been employed to identify association between genome regions or hot spots in the form of single nucleotide polymorphism and different traits, including grain quality  <cit> , plant height  <cit> , stalk rot  <cit> , grain flavonoid pigmentation traits  <cit> , seed size  <cit> , dhurrin content  <cit> , and cold germination  <cit> . most of these studies reinforce that association mapping has proved as a powerful approach for dissecting complex traits in sorghum. therefore a detailed analysis of association between seedling morpho-physiological and metabolite responses to cold and heat stresses, and that of specific genome regions of interest will be highly useful in developing molecular markers for stress-tolerance and is anticipated to enhance the efficiency of traditional breeding programs.

in this study,  <dig> diverse accessions of sorghum were used to conduct association analysis of seedling phenotypic variation during cold and heat stress treatments with the aim to highlight genetic differences that conditions adaptation to thermal stress. a detailed analysis of the genes present in the qtl regions was carried out to identify candidate genes involved in adaptation to cold and heat stress. specifically, the snps associated with the cold stress traits were validated in a set of genotypes with different tolerance to determine the haplotypes. the expression networks were also evaluated to elucidate putative pathway for thermal stress tolerance.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation and correlations among the cold and heat response traits
the summary of statistics of the phenotypic data gathered in this study indicated that the different germplasm of sorghum association panel displayed wide range of diversity both under cold and heat stress . the heritability values ranged from moderate  for a number of seedling traits and high for root and anthocyanin under cold stress . the heritability for morpho-physiological traits measured under heat stress was also in the moderate range of  <dig> – <dig>  . the analysis of variance showed that genotypes are significantly different for all traits analyzed . genotypes explained the largest proportion of variance among all sources of variation.table  <dig> summary statistics expressed as mean and heritability for traits evaluated for genome wide association studies of the sorghum associaiotn panel under stress at seedling stage. evaluation of analysis of variance is included in the table to assess the contributionof genotypes

the level of variation observed for various traits assessed is reflected in the histograms under cold and heat stress . notably, under cold stress the correlation between the traits was higher in shoot and root measurements while the correlation of anthocyanin levels with the others traits  were moderate and ranged only from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the correlation analysis among the traits under heat stress was also performed . seven traits under heat stress treatment had significant correlations, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between each other. however, the comprehensive pearson correlation analysis of traits between cold and heat stress showed less significant correlations between each other , indicating that sorghum seedlings exhibited different responses under these two temperature stress conditions at phenotypic or biochemical levels.fig.  <dig> variation and pearson pairwise correlations among cold stress related traits. histograms for shoot weight, root weight, shoot length, root length, and anthocyanin levels are displayed along the diagonal

these results suggest that the observed genetic variations underlying cold and heat stress responses at the seedling stage are biologically meaningful. thus, molecular markers associated with the traits could be applicable in sorghum breeding for improving cold and heat tolerance separately.

genome-wide association analysis under cold and heat stress
early-season cold and heat tolerance of sorghum seedlings is a pre-requisite for better crop establishment. several methods have been used to determine early stage cold tolerance in sorghum  and gosavi et al.  <cit>  has assessed heat tolerance of sorghum seedlings for a few genotypes. however, no significant efforts have been made to dissect the genetic mechanisms for heat tolerance of seedlings using large populations or germplasms in sorghum. broad variability for germination and emergence is a great advantage in breeding sorghum for adaptation  <cit> , therefore we used a sap to assess the variability among sorghum genotypes and find association for the traits measured under both stresses.

to understand whether there is common allelic variation that could explain differences under thermal stresses, we utilized community resource genotype data for the sap  <cit>  . a total of  <dig>  snps were utilized for gwas with the seedling traits data under controlled thermal stress. the phenotypic data for five and seven seedling traits for cold and heat stress respectively, utilized for the analysis are provided in the additional file  <dig> 

for cold stress, we evaluated five different traits which included shoot length, shoot weight, root length, root weight, and anthocyanin content followed by association analysis for these traits with 265 k snps . a total of  <dig> snps were significantly associated with the five traits measured with fdr values ≤ <dig>  . ten snps were significantly associated with anthocyanin content of fresh leaf and  <dig> snps were significantly associated with the root length . notably, the significant snps that indicate marker-trait associations  for the anthocyanin content and root length were observed mainly on chr <dig> and chr <dig> . associations for shoot length , shoot weight  and root weight  were found mostly on chr <dig> and chr <dig> .fig.  <dig> manhattan plots for significant marker-trait association under cold stress

previous studies in sorghum and other crops have suggested a role for root traits  and anthocyanin levels  during chilling stress response in sorghum. recent findings and reports suggested that root establishment could be one of the most important factors for field establishment, next to that of field germination  <cit> . furthermore, root biomass under controlled conditions was correlated with the seedling vigor under field conditions  <cit> . related studies suggest that root traits could influence the stay-green phenotype and seed yield in sorghum  <cit> . the significant associations of snps for root traits observed in the current study could indicate the possible role of genes tagged by such snps in adaptation or tolerance to chilling stress. the establishment of specific snps with positive contribution to robust root growth and actual seedling growth under cold temperatures would be beneficial in aiding selection of desirable germplasm with cold stress tolerance during screening with large number of accessions via marker-assisted selection.

the heat stress on sorghum seedlings showed association for shoot traits, but none were detected for the root measurements . the snps identified for shoot fresh weight were present on chr <dig>  chr <dig> and chr <dig> with  <dig> snps belonging to the same gene on chr <dig> . associations for shoot fresh weight explained 10–15% variation in the population and for shoot length from  <dig> to 25% variation . variation in shoot traits caused by higher temperature suggest that possible favorable alleles in a number of accessions could accelerate the growth, while other haplotypes could have negative effect of retarding plant development under heat stress. it was reported that high temperatures accelerate growth but with longer exposure, viability of seedlings declined  <cit> . chlorophyll measurements during heat stress showed significant associations with two snps which were present on chr <dig>  and for shoot length significant snps were localized on chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  .fig.  <dig> manhattan plots for significant marker-trait association under heat stress

the total chlorophyll content measured under heat stress provided association with snp s4_ <dig> and s4_ <dig> explaining 20% variance. associations with the chlorophyll content under heat stress were less significant as compared to the other traits. it is generally accepted that chlorophyll biosynthesis is highly sensitive to heat stress. to confer tolerance to heat-stress induced injury variations among genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway may provide protective mechanisms.

notably, snp associated with a number of seedling traits during thermal stress were linked to the variations in sorghum chr <dig>  for example, anthocyanin content trait  during cold stress had eight snp markers localized on chr <dig>  and shoot seedling traits under heat and cold stresses also, had eight snps localized on chr <dig> . a number of significant regions in chr <dig> has previously been implicated in other stress tolerance such as ergot resistance  <cit> , drought tolerance  <cit> , sugar metabolism  <cit> , and contrasting photoperiod conditions  <cit> . these results indicate an important role of genes in chr <dig> in sorghum growth and development under various environmental conditions making it an interesting focus for studies of selection.

genome scans for candidate genes near significant snps
majority of the snps associated with the traits subjected to thermal stresses were either within the gene or a few thousand nucleotides apart. notably, the resolution of such strong linkage to trait-responsible genes could be possible in our gwas study because of distinct quantitative measures of response to thermal stress as compared to indirect measures in other studies. thirty-three putative genes near the  <dig> associated loci were identified and ﻿are presented with gene annotations including possible functions, in table  <dig> table  <dig> list of candidate genes identified in the study based on proximity to the significant markers identified through gwas analysis and their description or function obtained from gramene and phytozome  databases




for cold stress conditions, we found that some genes were annotated as transcription factors and others belong to metabolic biosynthesis or transport. two bhlh transcription factors, sb06g <dig> and sb06g <dig> belong to an anthocyanin regulatory mechanism and were associated with the anthocyanin levels measured under cold conditions. transcription factors such as bhlh are suggested to be involved in stress-adaptive mechanisms; recent studies have shown the role of such transcription factors at least in part to cold tolerance, by positively regulating ros removal . similarly, sb03g <dig>  a c2h <dig> zinc finger protein with a putative splicing function, is associated with root fresh weight under cold conditions. zinc finger proteins are also involved in regulating tolerance mechanisms under oxidative stresses  <cit> , and more recently a study showed increases in fresh weight and root length upon cold stress compared to wild-type with the transformation of c2h <dig> domain gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . other transcription factors such as sb06g <dig> and sb05g <dig> were also associated with anthocyanin level and root length, respectively. these genes along with the regulatory transcription factors could be involved in membrane stability and tolerance to cold stress.

one of the significant qtls on chr <dig>  co-localizes with a gene identified in a previous study for coleoptile color  <cit> , which was a few hundred thousand nucleotides apart from the bhlh gene  as in the report of morris et al.  <cit> . in the current study, distinct snps found in sb06g <dig>  associated with quantitative measures of anthocyanin could be placed upstream of the putative bhlh regulatory gene. this variant could potentially be present in the cis-regulatory regions of the transcription factor sb06g <dig> and could be involved in the regulation of anthocyanin levels for maintaining seedling vigor during stress conditions.

for associated variation under heat stress conditions, we found candidate genes with possible functions as membrane protein , in sugar metabolism , as transcription factor , as proteasome , as ion transporter , and in lipid metabolism . the shoot fresh weight was associated with sugar metabolism, proteasome, and ion transporter genes. k+ ion transporter genes are involved in programmed cell death and metabolic adjustments  <cit> , whereas proteasomes are known to affect the heat sensitivity in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in this study, although the genomic analysis showed no overlap between associated regions, the genes involved in tolerance to thermal stress were related. many of the associations were found close to genes related to membrane transport and sugar metabolism, all of which have potential roles in different stress responses. therefore, many of the associations observed in our study are suggestive of a coordinated response in sorghum seedling during thermal stress. previous reports in research have suggested that response to cold and heat stresses are coordinated processes between primary and secondary metabolites and transporters .

validation of loci in a germplasm
the validation of significant snps was performed in nine sorghum lines to develop markers for potential use in breeding for thermal stress tolerance. here, we focused on loci associated with seedling cold tolerance traits in a set of breeding lines with their varying tolerance/sensitivity to cold stress. towards this end, allele-specific kasp primers were designed for each snp and used for germplasm genotyping. the results showed that nine of  <dig> associated snps consistently ﻿differentiate at least two susceptible lines from the tolerant lines . these nine variants could be the putative haplotype present in the sorghum that conditions tolerance cold response. these haplotypes were associated with three different traits  measured under cold stress. however, further studies are needed to establish any causal relation of these markers to actual tolerance or susceptibility response.

co-expression modules and expression patterns
the genes associated with the measured traits in this study could serve as a basis for exploring the thermal stress responsive mechanisms, and therefore it is important to evaluate the regulation and expression of the their gene networks. as it is difficult to evaluate all traits or metabolites affected by stress, expression networks can provide a logical approach towards identifying genes which otherwise could not be detected in gwas analysis due to limitations in markers density or panel size. in this study the co-expression networks for each of the genes associated with the traits measured under stress were retrieved from http://sorghum.riken.jp/morokoshi/  <cit>  to decipher biochemical pathways or gene regulatory networks related to significant snps .

we selected a few genes and their networks to understand their role in cold stress. sb06g <dig> and sb06g <dig> are involved in amino acid biosynthesis based on their gene networks whereas sb03g <dig> is functionally associated with spliceosome. the gene sb06g <dig> is a udp-glycosyltransferase superfamily protein involved in zeatin biosynthesis and was negatively associated with the anthocyanin levels. zeatin biosynthesis genes have been previously reported to be involved in defense mechanism upon cold stress  <cit> . cis-zeatin-type cytokinins are known to regulate the plant growth and the responses to environmental changes  <cit> .

similarly, s5_ <dig> associates with the gene sb05g <dig> and has a negative effect on fresh shoot weight upon heat stress. sb05g <dig> has no assigned function but the genes in its network belonged to the proteasome and rna transport. it is reported that in arabidopsis, proteasome subunit mutants limit 26s proteasome capacity within the cell and can cause heat shock hypersensitivity, and reduced cell division rates  <cit> . this suggests that sb05g <dig> and its network of genes are associated with the fresh shoot weight during heat stress.

we also evaluated co-expression network of sb06g <dig>  and found that the genes in the network were involved in sugar biosynthesis and transport . it has been shown that in higher plants, the anthocyanin pathway is regulated by a suite of transcription factors including myb, bhlh, and wd repeat proteins . studies have also reported that the induction of anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthesis can promote accumulation of metabolites such as sugars and hormones  <cit> .fig.  <dig> co-expression module for sb06g <dig>  one of the associated genes with anthocyanin level under cold stress in sorghum association panel




based on these networks of the genes, we likewise determined if any differences were found in the expression of the member genes in previous abiotic stress studies in sorghum. to do this, we examined the normalized fpkm values for the associated genes from a rnaseq experiment by chopra et al.  <cit>  and found that six of the  <dig> genes showed differential response upon cold stress between the susceptible and tolerant genotypes . the snps associated with the differentially expressed genes sb06g <dig>  sb06g <dig>  sb06g <dig>  and sb03g <dig> were present within or in very close proximity to the member gene itself . more importantly, we were able to confirm nucleotide differences between the cold tolerant and susceptible genotypes of sorghum.

since the differences of haplotype and expression levels were significant for four of the associated genes, we proceeded to to validate their expression levels. we selected sb06g <dig> transcription factor to validate the expression as the mutation linked to the gene could be in cis-regulatory region. the expression analysis confirmed that gene sb06g <dig> was relatively upregulated in the tolerant genotype  upon cold stress. however, the specific role of the gene in cold tolerance will require further molecular characterization. to evaluate if other genes involved in the network of sb06g <dig> were also affected by cold stress, we selected three other genes  that were affiliated with sb06g <dig>  similar expression patterns were observed between the tolerant and susceptible lines during cold stress , suggesting a possible role of these genes in cold tolerance of sorghum seedlings. from these results we can propose that sb06g <dig> and genes within its network are strongly associated with cold tolerance mechanisms. similarly, other genes such as sb06g <dig>  sb06g <dig>  and sb03g <dig> and their networks can be evaluated to determine their role in cold tolerance.fig.  <dig> quantitative-pcr analysis of genes in co-expression network of sb06g <dig> between cold tolerant , susceptible line , ems mutants ars <dig> and ars207




 we also utilized existing ethyl methyl sulfonate - mutants to evaluate effects of induced variation in the associated genes identified. fortuitously, ems-induced mutants for sb06g <dig> and sb03g <dig> genes from the above network are available from sorghum mutant library  <cit>  for evaluation. briefly, the ars <dig> mutant line had non-synonymous mutation in sb06g <dig>  and the ars <dig> mutant had a non-synonymous mutation in sb03g <dig>  <cit> . we performed expression analysis on these mutants to determine their effect on gene expression. on performing qrt-pcr expression analysis on the mutants compared to wild-type, we found down-regulation of sb06g <dig> in ars <dig>  but no differences in qrt-pcr data was observed in the ars <dig> for sb03g <dig> . however, further experiments are required to characterize and understand the functional aspects of these differential gene expression patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
a combined investigation involving seedling traits and metabolite phenotyping, aided by genomics based platforms, identified a number of key associations and their complex network of genes underlying the response of sorghum seedlings to cold and heat stresses. many of the associated snps with seedling traits were within or in very close proximity to stress responsive genes. the evaluation of haplotype differences in selected tolerant and susceptible genotypes for select snp markers associated with trait variation under cold stress can serve as a possible tool for marker assisted breeding in sorghum. differential gene expression during thermal stress for the candidate genes tagged aided in assessing whether the haplotypes identified here would be useful in understanding their role for molecular characterization. finally, we suggest that the application of expression networks along with rnaseq and gwas analysis, as highlighted in this study, provides a strong approach to elucidate molecular mechanism involved in thermal and other abiotic stress responses in cereal crops.
