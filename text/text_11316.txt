BACKGROUND
glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, is invariably associated with profuse and long-distance invasion of the brain parenchyma. accordingly, this tumor has been defined as "intraparenchymally metastatic"  <cit> . intra-parenchymal dissemination is largely responsible for systematic recurrence despite treatments  <cit> , and poor prognosis with a median survival time not exceeding one year  <cit> . preferential routes of long-distance dissemination have been identified, among which the basal lamina of blood vessels and fiber tracts  <cit> . numerous studies have revealed mechanisms of invasion in those conditions, specifying the molecular bases of glioma cells interaction with specific ligands of the brain extracellular matrix, their proteolytic modification by glioma cells, and the corresponding cellular receptors  <cit> . less is known about the mechanisms that underlie the migration of glioma cells among neural cells, in the brain parenchyma, despite its profuseness in the area that surrounds the tumor mass, and its major role in recurrence.

we have undertaken to identify the mechanisms of this particular type of glioma invasion, on the basis of the hypothesis that cells in the brain parenchyma may play a supportive role in this process. one key for the elaboration of this working hypothesis has been the demonstration that this intra-parenchymal invasion occurs in a non-destructive way , as this suggests that invading human glioblastoma cells may establish relationships of cooperation with their environment and in particular with resident brain cells. we have focused our attention on gap junctions because of two complementary reasons. first, evidence from peripheral tumors such as melanoma has implicated gap junctions in tumor cell migration  <cit> . second, gap-junctional communication via connexin  <dig>  between astrocytes and glioma cells has been demonstrated  <cit> , and linked to a phenotypic transformation of astrocyte which may render the brain parenchyma permissive to glioma invasion. in a recent study, lin et al. have strongly supported this hypothesis by establishing that non-migratory rodent c <dig> tumor cells display a migratory behavior following transplantation into the rat brain, when engineered to synthesize cx <dig>  <cit> . although cx <dig> was shown to exert additional cell adhesion effects, the authors demonstrated that promotion of migration was not associated with this role but with the establishment of functional gap junctional communication . astrocytes -to which glioblastoma cells are phenotypically most closely related- are widely inter-connected through gap junctions, formed predominantly by the protein cx <dig>  <cit>  and glioma cells also express cx <dig>  <cit> .

building up upon the concepts defined by zhang et al.  and lin et al. , we have explored their clinical relevance by looking at the ability of human glioblastoma cells to establish functional gap junctions with astrocytes, and at the role that such functional interaction may play in their migratory behavior. to observe and quantify the migration of human glioblastoma cells in a three-dimensional brain environment ex vivo, our analysis has taken advantage of isis, the "intra-slice implantation system" that we have recently developed  <cit> , in addition to in vitro glioma cell cultures and glioma/astroglial co-cultures. the isis set-up allows the implantation not only of human tumor cells but also of fragments of biopsied glioblastoma into rodent brain slices maintained in culture  <cit> . it allows for long term analysis of glioma cell migration in a three-dimensional organotypic environment that mimics that of the brain parenchyma and application of pharmacological agents to disrupt gjc.

RESULTS
heterocellular coupling and migration of human glioblastoma cell lines
heterocellular coupling was assessed in glioma-astrocytes co-cultures, using the dual-label technique, in which glioma cells were pre-labeled donors cells and astrocytes potential recipient cells labeled through gap-junctional diffusion of the dye. heterocellular coupling was more extensive for gl <dig> cells  than for 8-mg cells  .

analysis of tumor cells invasion was assessed in brain slice cultures, in which both homocellular coupling  and heterocellular coupling with astrocytes can occur. gl <dig> cells displayed a significantly higher invasive potential than 8-mg cells  .

addition of cbx induced a significant decrease in the heterocellular coupling index of gl <dig> cells with astrocytes  in co-cultures  whereas coupling was similar in control cultures either untreated, or treated with the functionally inactive analogue of cbx, gza. inhibition of gjc by cbx following implantation of gl <dig> into brain slices, resulted in a significant decrease in gl <dig> cells invasion into the brain parenchyma. the surface ratio  / s <dig> of migration was reduced by inhibition of the gap junction function  , as well as the number of gl <dig> cells that left the tumor mass  . there was no difference between results obtained in the gza and control groups. those results were confirmed when migration of glioma cells out of spheroids was analyzed over an astrocyte monolayer culture in a  <dig> hours-long time lapse experiment .

in contrast, cbx treatment had no significant effect on 8-mg migration, either in glioma-astrocytes co-cultures or following implantation into brain slices .

inhibition of gjc reduces invasion ability of cells either from human glioma xenografts maintained in nude mice or from fresh human glioma biopsies
the composite cellular content of glioma fragments and the technical difficulty in maintaining cells alive after seeding them in culture as cell suspensions, precluded analysis of the functional coupling of tumors, either maintained in nude mice or freshly biopsied. we, therefore, relied upon the effects of cbx to assess whether, similarly to results obtained in established glioma cell lines, inhibition of gjc may affect the migration of tumor cells out of a fragment and into the neural parenchyma of a brain slice.

invasive capacities of the seven tumors maintained in nude mice were quite heterogeneous. three were minimally invasive according to our criteria . these three tumors were precisely the ones in the series of  <dig> tumors to not exhibit any response to cbx treatment . among tumors characterized as "invasive" according to our criteria, cbx treatment significantly inhibited invasion in three , and had no statistically significant effect in one . inhibition concerned both the surface ratio of migration  and the number of migratory cells  . treatment with the inactive analogue gza had no effect on migration as compared to controls.

a, cut off : a tumor which exhibited less than  <dig> migrating cells distance of migration, if any, less than  <dig> μm, was considered non invasive.

in order to test whether the results obtained with experimental gliomas could be extrapolated to native tumors, the migration potentials of biopsies from  <dig> human high grade gliomas  were studied in brain slice culture, with or without addition of cbx or gza. overall, cbx treatment reduced migration indices of these four tumors by 30% ; this was the most pronounced for hg- <dig> .

ir: immunoreactivity

cx <dig> expression in glioma cells
in order to investigate whether cx <dig> was instrumental in the establishment of functional coupling between glioma cells and astrocytes, cx <dig> expression was analyzed in glioma cells from gbm cell lines and fresh human biopsies used in previous experiments. we chose to focus on cx <dig> because it is the major cx in astrocytes and is expressed by glioma cells  <cit> .

in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , three isoforms of cx <dig> could be separated on sds-page and visualized by immunoblotting as three distinct bands in control astroglial primary cultures: cx43-np, a non-phosphorylated isoform, cx43-p <dig> and cx43-p <dig>  the two phosphorylated isoforms of the protein . the cx43-p <dig> isoform was prominent and cx43-p <dig> and cx43-np isoforms were equally present . as for invasive potential, cx <dig> expression pattern was different in the two gbm cell lines with the gl <dig> cells exhibiting a three-fold higher concentration of the cx43-p <dig> as compared to 8-mg cells .

histological analysis of cx <dig> immunoreactivity in brain slices implanted with gl <dig> cells, showed that the protein was overexpressed in the tumor margin where glioma cells and astrocytes processes were intimately apposed and intermingled . confocal microscopy of brain slices allowed us to identify regions of enhanced immunostaining for cx <dig> at the interface between gl <dig> cells and astrocytes, suggesting the existence of heterocellular gap junctions . interestingly, these astrocytes displayed a bipolar morphology that extended in arrays a long process that paralleled the outward migrating cells. this was not observed when 8-mg glioma cells were implanted.

a general expression of the p <dig> isoform was observed in the seven tumors maintained in nude mice, and a variable expression of the cx43-np isoform. the four invasive tumors  expressed abundantly both cx <dig> isoforms cx43-np and cx43-p <dig>  whereas the three others  which were not invasive and did not exhibit any response to cbx treatment, expressed lower levels of cx43-p <dig> isoform and did not present detectable levels of cx43-np. . no expression of cx43-p <dig> was recorded.

the amount of tissue available for experimental analysis did not allow us to carry out western blotting on freshly biopsied tumor fragments. thus cx <dig> expression in the human tumor biopsies was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on paraffin embedded tissue section.

cx <dig> immunostaining was seen in all  <dig> specimens. staining was patchy, and both the intensity of staining and the number of immunostained cells in patches differed from one sample to another. in the typical case, a positive microscopic field contained several strongly stained cells, and several unequivocally labeled cells of lower intensity . homogenous fields of particularly strong immunolabeling intensity was observed in the hg- <dig> specimen.

homocellular coupling and migration of human glioblastoma cell lines
we have next evaluated homocellular coupling between glioma cells by the scrape loading method, in which homocellular coupling is demonstrated by the diffusion of the dye from mechanically lesioned cells to their neighbors in a monolayer culture. assay revealed extensive coupling of gl <dig> , comparable to that displayed by astrocytes in parallel control experiments , whereas 8-mg cells were only weakly coupled , a result in keeping with their low level of cx <dig> expression. homocellular coupling of all cell types was strongly affected by addition of the gap junctional blocker cbx: down to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for astrocytes , to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for gl <dig>  and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for 8-mg cells  , whereas gza had no effect.

to ensure that cbx-induced decreased migration of gl <dig> cells was mediated by the effect of the compound on gap junction communication, rather than more generally on the phenotype of tumor cells, analysis of tumor cell migration was performed in experimental conditions in which only homocellular coupling could exist, i.e. after seeding of glioma spheroids on a collagen iv matrix. surprisingly, when homocellular coupling between tumor cells was inhibited by cbx, both tumor cell lines displayed a significant increase in migration out of the spheroids  .

induction of glioma cell migration in vivo by overexpression of cx43
in order to validate further the hypothesis of a role of gjc formed by cx <dig> in tumor cell migration, we have used a technique adapted from that used by lin et al.   <cit> . c <dig> tumor cells have been genetically engineered by transfection, using a plasmid containing a fusion gene encoding gfp attached to the carboxyl terminus of cx <dig>  the gap junctions formed by this chimeric protein were dye-permeable  <cit> . c <dig> cells are known to proliferate without migrating out of the tumor mass, following implantation into the rat brain, and do not express a significant amount of cx <dig>  by transplanting mixed population of native and gfp-cx43-transfected cells, we explored the capacity for the latter to display specifically a migratory behavior. indeed, gfp-cx <dig> expressing c <dig> cells were preferentially located at the periphery of the tumor mass and some were even observed scattered in the surrounding brain parenchyma, strongly suggesting a migratory behavior . this was not observed with c6-gfp cells which were, as classically described, only present in the tumor mass.

discussion
the main result of this study is the demonstration that functional gjc between tumor cells and host astrocytes is instrumental in the invasion of the brain parenchyma by human glioblastoma cells. establishment of functional coupling between those two cell populations may be mediated by the gap junction protein cx <dig> as ability of glioblastoma cells of various origins to migrate out of the tumor bulk into the brain parenchyma, appeared related to the level of cx <dig> expression. in support of this hypothesis, overexpression of a fusion cx43-gfp gene construct triggered a migratory behavior in otherwise non-infiltrative c <dig> glioma cells implanted into the brain. the similarities between those results and mechanisms of neural precursor cell migration during embryonic development suggest that glioma cells may subvert and take advantage of a physiological mechanism of cell migration into the brain. in contrast, homocellular interaction between glioma cells through gap junctions hampers their dissemination out of the tumor mass, pointing to an additional role for gap junctions, in cell-to-cell adhesion.

over the past decade, studies on gjc in gliomas have mainly addressed its role in uncontrolled cell proliferation  <cit> , by analogy with epithelial cancers in which a low level of connexin expression is a sign of profoundly perturbed tissue homeostasis and malignant evolution  <cit> . the notion that, in gliomas, gjc may also favor migration draws scientific argumentation from embryology and from observations that other neurectodermal tumors such as melanoma need to establish gjc with host cells in order to migrate out  <cit> . this concept has been strongly supported recently by the demonstration that a c <dig> rodent glioma cell line that had been genetically engineered to express cx <dig> displayed a migratory behavior following transplantation into the rat brain  <cit> . this phenomenon was the more striking that the value of the rodent c <dig> cell line as an experimental model for glioblastoma has always been questioned because it did not reproduce the infiltrative phenotype which is a major characteristic of the human brain tumor. the induction of c <dig> migration was related to the establishment of functional gjc between glioma cells and host astrocytes through homotypic cx43-cx <dig> gap junctions.

several lines of evidence drawn from our results converge to indicate that this concept is clinically relevant, as gjc with astrocytes also plays a role in the migration of brain tumor cells for human glioblastomas. experimental results obtained here with native human glioblastoma cells of various origins, can indeed be interpreted as a demonstration of a similar role for gjc. first, pharmacological blockade of gjc by the specific inhibitor cbx  <cit>  had negative effects on tumor cell migration, whereas its inactive analogue gza  <cit>  did not. second, the gap junction protein cx <dig>  which is overexpressed by reactive astrocytes in the margin of glioblastomas  <cit> , was also expressed by all studied human tumors, including biopsy specimens, providing a molecular basis for the potential formation of homotypic heterocellular gap junctions. last, close membrane appositions at regions of reinforcement of cx <dig> immunostaining, suggesting intercellular contacts between astrocytes and glioma cells migrating out of a tumor spheroid or the body mass, were observed in co-cultures of glioma cells on an astroglial monolayer, as well as following implantation of tumors into brain slices maintained in organotypic cultures.

the pharmacological approach used here had both advantages and drawbacks, which should be indicated as they may limit the conclusions to be drawn. the main advantage of that technique is the fact that it allowed us to study gjc inhibition in fresh tumor samples, in which biological properties and diversity of glioblastoma cells are well preserved, in contrast to the clonal selection and genetic variation that are commonly observed with cells lines. conversely, we probably introduced some biological variability in the experimental system. this may be relevant to the fact that gjc inhibition with cbx did not abolish but rather reduced the rate of human glioma cell migration in our study, whereas lin et al.  obtained an "all-or-nothing" effect following genetic engineering of the c <dig> line. the partial effect on migration observed here may be due to the partial pharmacological inhibition consistent with the results of other studies  <cit>  that demonstrated that cbx only reduced gjc by 50%. alternatively, glioblastoma cell migration into the brain parenchyma does not relate exclusively to cell-to-cell interaction with astrocytes. interactions between tumor cell and matrix components   <cit>  are also major actors in glioma cell migration, and they are most likely not effected by inhibition of gjc, at least not directly. the use of a pharmacological compound also leads to questions about specificity. various compounds used to block gjc have additional non-specific and toxic effects, among which halotane, octanol or acidifying agents. cbx has been shown to be nontoxic and has no effect on cell proliferation, total protein synthesis or cell viability  <cit> . this is ascribed, by some authors, to its mode of action, through direct binding on connexon particles  <cit> . we have checked the specificity of the gjc effects via different experimental ways, including a systematic negative control with glycyrrhyzic acid , the cbx precursor which only differs from it by its inability to disrupt gjc. cbx and its inactive analog gza are known to both interact with mineralocorticoïd and glucocorticoïd receptors , but these receptors do not mediate cbx-decreased gjc  <cit> . we also tested cbx effect on cell apoptosis, cell proliferation or cell viability in our conditions. no significant effect was observed. although it has been reported that cx <dig> may induce cell growth  <cit> , we did not observe any effect of cbx on cell proliferation. it is interesting to mention that cbx-decreased gjc is mainly due to alteration of gap junction channel permeability, whereas cx overexpression is sufficient to regulate cell growth  <cit> . as an interesting positive control of the specificity of the effects recorded in co-cultures and following implantation of tumor cells into brain slices, we have observed an opposite effect of cbx on cell migration when only homocellular interaction between glioblastoma cells was concerned . altogether, these results support the conclusion that non-specific pharmacological effects, if any, did not alter results of our study in a consequential manner.

levels of cx <dig> expression were positively related to glioma invasiveness. analysis of cx <dig> expression by western blot allowed detection of two distinct isoforms of the cx <dig> protein, cx43-p and cx43-np. both isoforms were detected in the four highly invasive tumors , whereas the three minimally invasive tumors  displayed no detectable levels of cx43-p isoform. the presence of both cx <dig> isoforms strongly correlated with the invasive capacities of the tumor. however, whether the migratory capacity may depend on the overall levels of expression, and/or upon the concomitant presence of both cx <dig> isoforms is, at this stage, a matter of speculation. published data on the association of either isoform with the functional state of gap junctions are conflicting. phosphorylation of cx <dig> either on serine or tyrosine residues has been reported to disrupt gjc . this could in part explain why t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> tumors, which only displayed the phosphorylated isoform -the inactive isoform of cx43-, were non-invasive tumors. however, the reverse association between cx <dig> dephosphorylation and gjc inactivation has been suggested in astrocytes  <cit> . further biochemical analysis of cx <dig> isoforms function in these cells may reveal whether the pattern of cx <dig> isoform expression is involved in the invasive process and how this pattern can be altered by specific phosphorylation. on the other hand, it cannot be excluded that the abundance of both -p and -np isoforms in migrating tumors simply relates to a dynamic turnover of connexons between the cytoplasm  and the cell membrane of a migrating cell, where cx43-p may participate in short-lived contacts with host astrocytes  <cit> . recent data have shown that cbx itself did not have any effect on the phosphorylation pattern of cx <dig>  <cit> .

in the biopsy specimens, levels of cx <dig> expression were different from one tumor to another, and from one zone to another within a specimen, in agreement with results reported by other authors  <cit> . interestingly, the highest expression of cx <dig> was seen in hg- <dig>  the tumor in which migration was the most substantially inhibited by cbx. in addition, transfection of c <dig> glioma cells with a cx <dig> protein fused to a green fluorescent protein allowed us to trace c6-cx <dig> cells after intrastriatal stereotactic implantation. consistent with results of lin et al  and  <cit> , only c6-cx <dig> cells switched to an invasive phenotype providing a direct evidence of the positive correlation between glioma cells cx <dig> expression and invasive potential. we hypothesize that cx <dig> may favor glioma cells migration by facilitating glioma cells to form gap junction interactions with host astrocytes that will allow them, through currently unknown molecular mechanisms, to drag out from the tumor mass.

a peculiar morphological finding in this study was the phenotypic alteration of astroglial processes around tumors. changes in the astroglial phenotype induced by glioma cells through gjc have been observed by other authors  <cit> . the isis protocol used here allowed us to gain a comprehensive three-dimensional view of the astroglial meshwork, and to identify the radial orientation of astrocytic processes toward the body of the tumors. this organization is reminiscent of the scaffolding of radial glial cells observed in the developing neocortex in vivo  <cit> and in vitro  <cit> . radial glial cells extending long processes from the ventricular zone to the cortical plate  <cit> communicate with migrating neurons through cx <dig> gap junctions  <cit> . although tentatively, we may therefore speculate that astroglial cx <dig> provide similarly support and guidance to the migrating tumor cells. in the same way as immature neuronal cells do  <cit> , glioma cells may trigger the phenotypic change of surrounding astrocytes into radial glia-like cells, in order to make them suitable as a substrate for migration.

the three different migration assays allowed us to explore the importance of intercellular interactions between migrating cells and cellular environment occurring during invasion. we have shown that inhibition of homocellular gjc in gl <dig> spheroids seeded on collagen iv , boosted glioma cell motility, resulting in a higher centrifugal dispersion of cells. this result is in keeping with that obtained by lin et al  in an experiment in which cx <dig> was shown to mediate glioma cell adherence and aggregation. however, accelerated motility of gl <dig> glioma cells when cbx blocked homocellular glioma/glioma gjc was not observed when glioma cells additionally formed heterocellular gjc with astrocytes, i.e. on astrocyte monolayer or in brain slices. quite the contrary, heterocellular glioma-astrocytes gjc seemed to be necessary for the invasive process to occur normally, as cbx significantly blocked it in those conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the purpose of our study was to determine whether the concept that functional gap junctional communication with host astrocytes facilitates invasion of malignant glioma cells put forward by other authors on the basis of experiments using a rodent glioma model , indeed apply to human glioblastoma and may, as a consequence, bear clinical relevance. this has indeed been clearly confirmed by the inhibitory effect of the specific gjc blocker, carbenoxolone, on the migration of human glioblastoma cells. results obtained ex vivo on different supports of migration point to a functional difference between homocellular  and heterocellular  gjc. this may eventually be of prime therapeutic interest, by revealing mechanisms by which glioma cells disengage themselves from their neighbors in the tumor bulk, and establish new contacts with host astrocytes in order to migrate away  <cit> .
