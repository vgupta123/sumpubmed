BACKGROUND
during the first ten cell cycles after fertilization, the zebrafish embryo is
transcriptionally silent and consists of undifferentiated and rapidly dividing
blastomeres  <cit> . initiation of transcription at the 10th cell cycle is termed
zygotic genome activation . at the time of zga, development proceeds from a control
by mrnas synthesized during oogenesis and stored in the egg  to
mrnas produced by the embryo’s own genome. following zga, blastomeres divide less
frequently and more asynchronously, they start to differentiate and migrate to form the
three germ layers of the gastrulating embryo  <cit> . collectively, these transformations characterize the mid-blastula transition
. these fundamental cellular and functional changes occurring during development
make zebrafish an attractive model to study transcriptional changes governing between
pre-mbt and post-mbt development.

previous studies have shown essential roles of activation and degradation of maternal
transcripts in regulating the mbt and zga  <cit> . signaling pathways involving bmp, nodal, fgf, wnt and maternal
β-catenin are essential for the formation of germ layers and body axis  <cit> . we and others have shown that the establishment of post-translationally
modified histones on specific genomic sites and dna methylation play a role in
transcriptional regulation around the time of zga by patterning developmental gene
expression  <cit> . however, although several early transcriptomes have recently been published  <cit> , little is known on the isoform-specific dynamics governing developmental
transitions around the mbt.

the notion that each gene can give rise to multiple mrnas has evolved from being
reported as a rare phenomenon  <cit>  to include virtually all loci in man  <cit> , and has been shown to be crucial for differentiation  <cit> , development  <cit>  and human disease  <cit> . isoform switches, defined as a change in the isoform composition of gene
products between two conditions  are of particular
interest since such events are critical for differentiation  <cit> . the differences between transcript isoforms can affect the coding sequence
 and/or untranslated regions  3' or 5' of the cds. the former is likely to
affect protein function, while the latter may affect translational efficiency, mrna
degradation kinetics and spatial distribution of transcripts  <cit> . the mechanisms regulating splicing and determining the production of
specific transcript isoforms have started to be unveiled and involve
cis-elements and trans-acting factors, as well as epigenetic
modifications in the proximity of spliced exons  <cit> . a genome-wide landscape of transcript isoforms synthesized during early
development, and particularly of the switches occurring between maternal and zygotic
isoforms at the time the embryo initiates its own transcriptional program, has been
lacking and has hampered a comprehensive appreciation of the transcriptional dynamics
occurring at the time of zga.

we have used an isoform prediction and quantification program, cufflinks  <cit> , to detect novel isoforms and quantify isoform-specific changes from
rna-sequencing  reads before and after zga in zebrafish. we identify numerous
novel isoforms related to shifts in transcription start site , alternative splicing
 events and transcription termination sites , when comparing transcripts of
maternal and zygotic origin coming from the same gene. these include transcripts of
genes involved in cell-cell interactions, pluripotency control and dna methylation.
using h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> trimethylation  data acquired by chromatin immunoprecipitation
and high-throughput sequencing , we find that h3k4me <dig> can form relatively
broad domains which cannot distinguish between closely spaced alternative tsss, unless
tsss are linked to alternative promoters at distant locations. skipped exons are
enriched in h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  extending previous reports on the involvement of these
histone modifications in the regulation of isoform usage.

RESULTS
mapping of rna-seq reads achieved from combined use of two aligners
using two different short rna-seq read aligning programs, namely bioscope  and tophat  <cit> , we remapped all reads generated by rna-seq in a recently published study  <cit> . this ‘two aligner’ approach yields a higher number of mapped
reads than each aligner alone and proves to be complementary compared to using either
aligner separately .
from our rna-seq data, four datasets from pre-zga zebrafish developmental stages
 and two from post-zga stages  were merged, respectively
generating one maternal transcriptome dataset, and one combined late maternal-early
zygotic  dataset .
this strategy yields an opportunity to examine the embryonic transcriptome before and
after zga, and provides more sequencing depth and thus higher accuracy in
constructing transcripts. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig> million rna-seq reads were thus
mapped from the pre-mbt and post-mbt developmental stages, respectively.
three pre-mbt samples  were merged to represent
the maternal transcriptome. this period is characterized by absence of
transcription and pluripotent blastomeres. two samples were merged to represent
the first zygotic transcriptome, representing the embryo when cells start to
differentiate and transcription has begun. the rna-seq reads were mapped using
two different aligners  and cufflinks was used to
construct transcriptomes guided by ensembl annotation. this resulted in a
complete gene annotation set  comprising both expressed and
non-expressed genes and one dataset with robust > <dig> fpkm level of expression
. embryo illustrations are from kimmel et al. .

transcriptome assembly identifies novel genes and isoforms
we used the cufflinks software and associated tools  <cit>  to assemble transcriptomes based on the mapped reads . cufflinks was run in reference annotation based transcript
assembly -mode  <cit> , using annotations from ensembl as a guide . we created
two datasets. i) a set of all ensembl annotations and all transcripts assembled was
generated, referred to as the ‘all’ gene annotation; this set contains
 <dig>  transcripts from  <dig>  genes .
ii) expression values were obtained for the ‘all’ dataset  and these were used to filter the ‘all’
gene annotation to generate a file of robustly expressed transcripts, defined as
fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments with a value >3
 . this dataset
contains  <dig>  isoforms from  <dig>  genes . of
these transcripts, the vast majority  have multiple exons . these multiple-exon transcripts arise from  <dig>  genes
, thus multi-exon loci produce on average
nearly  <dig> isoforms. altogether, we identify  <dig>  tsss  and  <dig>  transcription termination sites  in the
fpkm >  <dig> gene annotation dataset .
this indicates that a large fraction of the isoforms arise from differential use of
tsss or ttss. however, the fact that isoforms from the same locus with different tsss
also frequently differ in their exon content is a reflection of cufflinks’
parsimonious nature, because cufflinks proposes as few transcript models as necessary
to explain the aligned reads  <cit> .

exons in the all and fpkm >  <dig> datasets.  percentages of
loci with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or more tsss.  percentages of loci with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or
more ttss.  percentage of isoforms classified as ntr, identical
 or new in the fpkm >  <dig> dataset.  difference
between the novel and annotated transcripts on functional domain content.
most novel isoforms had retained all functional domains as compared to their
closest matching annotated counterpart.

to identify novel isoforms and genes, the predicted isoforms in the
fpkm >  <dig> dataset were compared to ensembl annotations .
this classifies  <dig>  of the transcripts as identical,  <dig>  as new isoforms, and
 <dig>  as novel transcribed regions  i.e. possibly novel genes
. this analysis indicates that the assembled
zebrafish transcriptome contains numerous novel transcripts, some of which may be
encoded by novel genes.

functional differences between annotated and novel transcripts
the large number of novel isoforms warranted further validation and characterization.
we investigated the coding potential of new isoforms and found that nearly all have
an open reading frame   of > <dig> amino acids in length
. increasing the orf
length requirement results in a slight decrease in the number of orfs detected .

we then compared both the transcript sequence and the inferred coding sequence
between novel isoforms and their closest matching annotated transcript from the same
locus . on average, the novel isoforms have shorter coding
sequences than the corresponding annotated coding sequences with a mean difference of
−230 bp . of  <dig>  comparisons,  <dig>  of the
novel isoforms differ by one amino acid or less, indicating identical coding
sequences . transcript isoforms with no difference in coding sequences length have on
average longer 5’ and/or 3’ utrs, with a mean length difference of
549 bp . therefore, the novel isoforms can be broadly
divided into two groups, those with no change in coding sequence length but with
longer 5’ and/or 3’ utr, and those with an alteration in coding sequence
length.

we next examined any functional effect these transcript isoforms may have, and used
the predicted protein sequences for a domain scan using pfam, a database of protein
families  <cit> . the detection of a protein domain has been shown to be suggestive of
protein functionality  <cit> . of the novel isoforms analyzed,  <dig>   contain a sequence with high
similarity to an identified protein domain. in comparison, the closest matching
annotated transcripts  have a substantially larger fraction of
pfam domain-containing sequences . further, most of the novel isoforms
encode the same functional domains as the annotated isoforms . however, a substantial fraction loses either all functional
domains , or some of them . also, a small subgroup
 of the novel isoforms contains functional domains absent from
the annotated isoform . taken together, these
results suggest that the majority of the novel transcript isoforms are functional,
with roles related to their annotated counterparts. however, some lose or gain
functional domains, suggesting that they might exhibit different biological
functions.

tss usage and switching
transcription is initiated at tsss and differential usage of tsss is often associated
with tissue-specific expression or distinct protein products  <cit> . using cufflinks, we identify  <dig> loci  with a change in tss usage between pre-
and post-zga stages. a typical example is the isoforms of dazl encoding an
rna-binding protein crucial for germ cell development, oocyte-to-zygote transition
and maintenance of pluripotency  <cit> . the biological function of the dazl protein is at the level of regulation
of translation  <cit>  and recent experiments indicate that dazl protects transcripts from
degradation, possibly through antagonizing the de-adenylating effect of mirnas  <cit> . our data show that the transcript isoforms of dazl are expressed
from at least two promoters maternally ; promoter 2 = grey
arrows  <dig> and  <dig>  black arrows in the top panel point towards reads supporting
expression from both tsss pre-zga). in the post-zga transcriptome, the lack of reads
supporting usage of promoter  <dig>  demonstrates degradation of the maternal-specific 5’ distal
isoform during the mbt . rt-qpcr confirms the
trend observed by rna-seq .
both dazl isoforms are present in ensembl . the cds of the maternal-specific transcript displays a
 <dig> amino acid shorter n-terminus compared to the zygotic transcript. however, the
functional implication of this difference is not straightforward because the
rna-recognition motif of the dazl protein is located  <dig> amino acids downstream and is
not affected, unless induced by configuration change. considering the diverse and
temporarily restricted roles of dazl in germ cell development and oocyte-to-zygote
transition  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that the maternal and zygotic isoforms may be
responsible for two biological processes: the ‘maternal’ version may act
in the oocyte-to-zygote transition, whereas the zygotic variant may act in germ cell
development.
skipping switch.  a screenshot from integrative genomics
viewer shows that dazl has been transcribed from at least two
tss’s in the maternal transcriptome; grey arrows 1– <dig> at bottom
indicate ensembl annotated tsss. black arrows in the upper panel indicate reads
supporting promoter  <dig>  and promoter 2/ <dig> . a white arrow in the
upper panel points at a splice junction ‘bridge’ , symbolizing
the splice junction for the most distal first exon. the thickness of splice
junction symbols is correlated with the number of reads supporting the
junction. post-zga transcripts lack the most 5’ exon as can be observed
from the absence of reads supporting the splice junction originating from this
exon .  pre-zga an f11r isoform
with exon  <dig> included is present . post-zga a different
f11r isoform, this one with exon  <dig> lacking, has been transcribed
.  the f11r exon skipping  leads to a frame shift resulting in a  <dig> nt longer orf, including the
removal of two c-terminal valine residues. two functional domains,
immunoglobulin v-set domain  and immunoglobulin domain 
 are intact in both splice isoforms.

among the  <dig> genes which display a change in tss pattern between the pre- and
post-zga, dazl represents a subset where the tsss are defined by different
first exons. this type of tss switch is likely to affect developmental functions as
illustrated with dazls changes in the 5’utr and n-terminus of the
protein.

epigenetic regulation of tss usage and expression
h3k4me <dig> enrichment over the tss is considered as a histone modification associated
with transcription permissiveness. while virtually all expressed genes are marked by
h3k4me <dig> at the tss  <cit> , many genes that are not expressed also harbor h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . h3k27me <dig> promoter occupancy is on the other hand associated with
transcriptional repression  <cit> . to identify a relationship between tss usage and potentially associated
chromatin marks, we used published chip-seq peak calling data for h3k4me <dig> and
h3k27me <dig> in post-mbt stage embryos  <cit> , and investigated the correlation between these histone modifications and
the tsss mapped in our study.

we find that a subset of  <dig>  tsss from  <dig>  genes from our ‘all’
gene annotation dataset are enriched in h3k4me <dig>  most peaks  were
within ±500 bp of a gene. the number of tsss in the dataset and the number
of peaks covering them indicates that multiple tsss are included within each h3k4me3
peak, as exemplified by dazl and sall <dig> . on rare occasions, we observe that h3k4me <dig> peaks
are located over the most frequently used tss  . therefore, at present
h3k4me <dig> peaks cannot be used to predict the major tss since the mark can overlap
multiple tsss. more accurate determination of tss usage, e.g. using approaches such
as cap analysis of gene expression  together with h3k4me <dig> enrichment data may
improve the usefulness of this histone modification in predicting major active start
sites among closely located tsss.

our rna-seq data show that 21% of the h3k4me3-marked genes are expressed at very low
levels, with  <dig>  loci displaying an fpkm value below  <dig> in both pre- and post-zga
samples . for the subgroup of
bidirectional promoters identified using the h3k4me <dig> peaks   we find no significant correlation in expression
between the bidirectional gene pairs , again supporting h3k4me <dig> as a mark for predisposition of
promoter activation rather than having a direct activating effect, even when
presumably sharing the same promoter. however, on average, h3k4me3-marked genes are
more strongly expressed than genes without h3k4me <dig>  as described earlier for refseq
genes   <cit> .

an important question is whether epigenetic marks can regulate particular subgroups
of genes, functionally and spatially. to address the first question, analysis in
david of gene ontology  terms for biological functions were obtained using
h3k4me3- and h3k27me3-marked genes. this was significant only for one term for the
h3k4me3-marked genes; cell cycle . this is in contrast to h3k27me3-marked genes which were
enriched for  <dig> go terms with the same cut off . thus, whereas h3k4me <dig> mark tsss of
genes linked to many biological functions, h3k27me <dig> marks mostly the tsss of genes
involved in developmental functions. these results are consistent with a h3k4me3
pre-patterning of promoters of a specific subset of genes pre-mbt , and with a view of h3k27me <dig> repressing
developmental genes prior to their activation at or after the mbt  <cit> .

another intriguing question is whether tss marking with both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me3
exists . we utilized the extensive annotation
database of where zebrafish genes are expressed anatomically  to bring further clarity to this issue. h3k4me3-marked genes are mostly
expressed in the entire organism, in contrast to h3k27me3-marked genes which are
predominantly annotated with expression in distinct tissue types . this is consistent with h3k27me3
analysis of dissected xenopus embryos  <cit> , and not supportive of bivalency in zebrafish embryos, as others have
suggested  <cit> .

taken together, our results show that during zebrafish development, h3k4me <dig> is a mark
of tsss independent of transcription status. the marked genes show no pronounced
tissue-specific preferences and few specialized biological function as a group. in
contrast, h3k27me <dig> marked genes have specific biological functions and are expressed
in specialized cells. our results are in line with the view that h3k4me <dig> contributes
to a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment for tss usage; however, the
repressive marks seem to contribute to lineage commitment and tissue-specific
differentiation  <cit> . the use of chip-seq data and a comprehensive gene annotation based on
existing and novel annotations confirm the trends from previous studies based on
older annotation and chip-chip data  <cit> .

shifts in alternative splicing during the switch from maternal to zygotic
transcripts
alternative splicing  allows the production of multiple mature mrnas from the
same primary transcript, increasing genetic diversity of a genome by several-fold. we
used cufflinks to identify shifts in as isoform patterns before and after the zga. a
total of  <dig>  primary transcripts exhibited a significant change in the splice
isoform composition . quality control
by visual inspection revealed mostly subtle changes among the significantly changing
primary transcripts. importantly we find, also by visual inspection, that several
obvious isoform switches do not pass the significance criteria of cufflinks. for
example, we report f11r, encoding a trans-membrane adhesion protein found in
association with tight junctions  <cit> , which displays a switch between the maternal and zygotic stages, with
exon  <dig> skipped only in the zygotic transcripts . using reverse transcription -qpcr, we validated the expression
pattern of f11r .
exon  <dig> of f11r is only 13 bp long and is included in the maternal
isoform of the f11r transcript . skipping of exon  <dig>  detected in the zygotic transcriptome , causes a frame-shift with an alteration of the
c-terminal  <dig> amino acids; however two known functional domains in the f11r protein
are not directly affected, although indirect structural effects cannot be excluded
. the change in the intracellular c-terminal
portion of the protein includes the removal of two terminal valine residues which are
involved in binding to pdz-domain containing proteins  <cit> . in zebrafish, interference with f11r function causes defects in migration
at later stages of development  <cit> . interestingly, the shift in f11r isoform usage between pre- and
post-mbt stages coincides with the initiation of cell migration taking place after
the mbt  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that attenuation of binding potential to pdz
domain-containing proteins enables cells to alter their migration patterns  <cit> . however, functional studies are required to test this hypothesis.

from our dataset, it appears therefore that thousands of splice isoform switches
occur between the maternal and zygotic transcriptomes; nonetheless, it is important
to emphasize that the majority constitutes subtle changes rather than obvious
functional on/off events.

quantification of as events
we used the software astalavista  <cit>  to quantify the frequency of four different types of as events; exon
skipping , alternative donor  and acceptor  sites and intron retention
 . using the fpkm > 3
transcript subset, we identify a total of  <dig>  as events linked to  <dig>  loci . aa and ad sites make up  <dig>   and  <dig>   of these
events, respectively, and we find  <dig> ir and  <dig>  es occurrences . noteworthy, only 39% of the es events involve the skipping of
a single exon, while the majority of these events involve the skipping of ≥2
exons .
different alternative splicing events: exon skipping , alternative acceptor
site , alternative donor site  and intron retention . es is the
most frequent as event. in most es events multiple exons are skipped.
 schematic representation of an annotated version  and a new
 isoform for dnmt <dig>  black lines between the isoforms represent
the conserved area. functional domains  were defined by pfam: dmap1
binding domain , cytosine specific methyltransferase
replication foci domain , cxxc zinc finger domain
, bromo-adjacent homology domain , c- <dig> cytosine-specific dna methylase domain .
in the new isoform  <dig> exons are skipped, and all functional domains except a
dmap <dig> binding domain are lost. the novel isoform also have a longer 5’utr
relative to the annotated version.  novel pou5f <dig> isoforms.
the annotated version of pou5f <dig> has two pfam domains; homeobox domain
 and pou . we identify  <dig> novel alternative acceptor sites
 all within the cds of pou5f <dig>  the first leads to a
 <dig> nt deletion and removal of one glutamic acid, upstream of the pou; the second
a  <dig> nt insertion causing a frame shift and a truncated pou5f <dig> protein with
both functional domains lost; the third event gives a  <dig> nt deletion which
truncates the hb. we also detect a longer 3’ utr post-zga .

an example of the latter includes dnmt <dig>  encoding dna methyltransferase 1
responsible for maintenance of dna methylation patterns, particularly during
development . dnmt <dig> has approximately  <dig> exons with three isoforms annotated
in zebrafish; however, our analysis detects several additional isoforms . cufflinks predicts  <dig> dnmt1
isoforms , but without full-length sequence data the number of
biologically relevant isoforms remains uncertain. one new isoform of dnmt1
is robustly expressed maternally  and
truncated due to skipping of  <dig> exons . this skipping event removes
most of the functional domains involved in dna methyltransferase activity, but it
retains a dmap <dig> binding domain . this domain
binds the co-repressor dmap <dig> and thereby confers dnmt <dig> with transcriptional repressor
activity  <cit> . interestingly, in xenopus it has been shown that dnmt <dig> is needed
to repress transcription prior to the mbt  <cit>  and this function does not rely on the cytosine methyltransferase
catalytic activity of dnmt <dig>  <cit> . zebrafish may therefore be a valuable candidate to shed more light on the
functional role of dnmt <dig> and its isoforms. the novel dnmt <dig> isoforms
discovered in this study may bring clarity to the enigmatic issue of transcriptional
repression during cleavage stages in zebrafish  <cit>  and other species  <cit> .

for the pluripotency-associated gene pou5f <dig>  we
identify several new splicing events, all of which were confirmed by cdna cloning and
sequencing . in
zebrafish, there is only one annotated pou5f <dig> transcript, while in human
three arise from as  <cit> . we observe novel pou5f <dig> as events originating from alternative
acceptor sites at exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the first event leads to deletion of
a nucleotide triplet coding for glutamic acid , yet with no effect on the functional domains. the
removal of a charged amino acid is however likely to affect the three-dimensional
structure of pou5f <dig>  although functional consequences remain unknown at this stage.
the second as event is located  <dig> nt prior to the annotated exon  <dig> . this leads to a frame-shift and a truncated pou5f <dig> protein,
removing both functional domains. lastly, a  <dig> nt deletion causes a frame-shift in the
exon  <dig>  and leads to a truncation of the homeobox domain. of note, we also find
novel isoforms for other genes important for pluripotency, such as klf <dig> 
sall <dig> and nanog. this indicates that several well-studied genes
with central functions in pluripotency are still not fully annotated in zebrafish,
and highlights a likelihood of uncovering novel intricacies about pluripotency
control mechanisms.

epigenetic marks associated with exon skipping
as predominantly occurs co-transcriptionally, which may influence the regulation of
splicing by changes of epigenetic signatures such as histone modifications and dna
methylation  <cit> . we used chip-seq to map h3k36me <dig> occupancy in post-zga embryos, and used
published peak calling data for h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  <cit>  to investigate any association between these modified histones and single
es events. we extracted the number of reads spanning each skipped exon ;  <dig>  single es events have
one or more reads supporting the skipping event, of which most only with a few reads
spanning them. focusing on  <dig> exons with > <dig> reads supporting the skipping of these
exons at the post-mbt stage, we examined peaks of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k36
trimethylation in their vicinity . h3k36me <dig> peaks and skipped exons
co-localize in  <dig> of the  <dig> exons , which represent a slight overrepresentation relative to a random set of
regions . h3k4me <dig> is also
slightly overrepresented , whereas h3k27me <dig> is not overrepresented over skipped exons
.

from metagene sections of average enrichment profiles containing the skipped exon as
well as introns upstream and downstream of the skipping event, we find that both the
upstream intron and the skipped exon display higher levels of h3k36me <dig> than average,
determined from random selections of the entire set of introns and exons
. introns localized downstream of the skipped
exons only show slightly higher h3k36me <dig> enrichment values than the average. since
h3k36me <dig> associates with expressed genes  <cit> , a possible explanation for h3k36me <dig> enrichment on the skipped exons may
be that the exons are only skipped in a subpopulation of cells in the embryo,
reflecting distinct transcript profiles in individual cells. isoforms with the exon
included can thus be more prevalent and account for the observed enrichment in
h3k36me <dig>  however as expected, globally in the cell populations examined, the skipped
exons have on average substantially lower number of reads mapped to them than the
rest of the exons . this
shows that the h3k36me <dig> enrichment at skipped exons is not due to expression of an
isoform with the exon included in the majority of the cells. collectively, our
observations are consistent with a role of h3k36me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> as possible
facilitators, rather than determinants, of increased exon skipping  <cit> .
exons and surrounding introns. metagenes based on h3k36me <dig> levels for
upstream introns, skipped exons and downstream introns show increased h3k36me3
levels in the upstream intron and the exon, but only to minor extent in the
downstream intron, as compared to background. red

longer 3’utrs in zygotic than in maternal transcripts
the tts can be regulated either through termination of transcription  <cit>  or via the 3’-end processing machinery  <cit> . regardless of the mechanism, sequence motifs in the 3’utr play an
important role in mrna stability, spatial distribution and translational efficiency  <cit> . we observe that zygotic transcripts frequently have longer 3’utrs
than corresponding maternal transcripts, as exemplified by pou5f1
. to investigate the genome-wide
frequency of longer 3’utr in post-zga relative to pre-zga embryos, we extracted
all last exons and counted the number of reads mapping to the first and second half
of the last exon. using these counts, we calculated a numeric score where higher
values indicate a shift towards a longer 3’ terminal exon post-zga . we find that  <dig>  last exons increase in length post-zga relative to
pre-zga . a metagene projection for
these  <dig>  last exons using rna-seq coverage confirms the detection of more reads in
the last half of the exons post-zga . the
observation of longer 3’utrs can be interpreted in light of a recent report of
shorter 3’utrs of highly expressed transcripts  <cit> . we may infer from this report and our results that post-zga embryos
produce transcripts with a more diversified control of turn-over kinetics, together
with spatial and cell-type specific expression, than the oocyte. in drosophila
melanogaster, extension of 3’utrs after the maternal-to-zygotic
transition  have been reported  <cit> . similarly in the mouse, the 3’utr becomes progressively longer
during embryonic development  <cit> . furthermore, while this manuscript was in preparation, ulitsky and
colleagues  <cit>  reported extended 3’utrs in  <dig> genes after zga in zebrafish
embryos, using poly-position profiling by sequencing. thus our findings validate
previous reports in zebrafish and other species.

transcripts detected with more coverage in the proximal half of the terminal
exon post-zga  as compared to pre-zga . x-axis is in
percentage of total length and y-axis is number of reads normalized against
total number of reads in the samples.  the gene magi1
displays a change in the expression of its isoforms pre- and post-zga with an
alternative 3’utr appearing post-zga . prior to the zga
a novel isoform is expressed . this isoform is expressed
also after the mbt but then together with the novel isoform.

in addition to the extension of last exons, we also observe alternative last exon
usage, which may lead to changes in the cds, the 3’utr or both. an example of
the latter is apparent in magi <dig>  encoding a pdz domain protein; due to a
switch in last exon usage between pre- and post-zga, both the cds and the 3’utr
are changed . the 3’utr of the
post-zga-specific isoform contains three additional sequence domains absent in the
maternal version, namely an internal ribosome entry site , a sex-lethal binding
site  and a k-box element. the latter two are known to often co-occur to
create spatial and temporal expression patterns through negative regulation of
translation  <cit> . in addition, although the pdz domains are not directly affected,
alteration in protein sequence might affect the protein 3d-structure and in
particular the fifth pdz domain located proximal to the c-terminus  <cit> . interestingly, magi <dig> interacts with β-catenin  <cit> , another regulator of cell adhesion crucial for left-right asymmetry of
the embryo  <cit> . each pdz domain often displays distinct protein specificity and
strikingly, β-catenin binding to magi <dig> depends on the 5th pdz domain,
thus potentially linking the isoform switch reported in our study to the regulation
of wnt signaling through β-catenin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptomes assembled in this study contain a high degree of complexity
pertaining to tsss, as and ttss. most of the described novel isoforms encode orfs with
predicted significant functional protein domains, suggesting functional and valid
transcripts with a role in development. we report several loci which display a
switch-like behavior in isoforms expressed pre-zga and post-zga stages; these notably
include dazl , f11r  and magi1
. their changes in expression pattern coincide with key
developmental processes such as onset of transcription upon zga, cell speciation and
migration, suggesting functional roles for these isoforms. we also identify validated
novel isoforms for dnmt <dig> and pou5f <dig>  important genes in development
and pluripotency control. moreover, we find increased length of the 3’ terminal
exon and 3’utr after the zga in over  <dig>  transcripts. analysis of histone marks
suggests that h3k4me <dig> has little value in marking the major tss in loci with several
start sites. however, we find higher levels of h3k36me <dig> over skipped exons relative to
all exons, suggesting a role of h3k36me <dig> in zebrafish as control.
