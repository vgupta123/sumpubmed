BACKGROUND
the disease-associated prpsc or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , are invariably lethal neurodegenerative illnesses that affect humans and many animal species; they include bovine spongiform encephalopathy of cattle and creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in humans  <cit> . the causative agent is termed prion and was proposed to be identical to prpsc, a pathological conformer of the prpc encoded by the prnp gene  <cit> . the conversion of the normal prpc into the abnormal prpsc isoform is a key feature of prion diseases  <cit> . although the molecular mechanisms of conversion are not fully understood, it is known that mature prpc expressed on the cell surface is essential for prion propagation and pathogenesis. conversion of prpc to prpsc is believed to involve direct interaction of the two prion protein  isoforms  <cit> . several agents including anti-prp monoclonal antibodies  have been directed at the binding of the two prp isoforms to inhibit the conversion of prpc to prpsc and ultimately block the neuronal pathogenicity  <cit> . however, the administration of monoclonal antibodies  generated via hybridoma technology while feasible and effective present several limitations  <cit> . the 145– <dig> kda igg protein is poorly diffused from vessels into tissues, particularly into the central nervous tissue. this may explain why administration of mabs has been shown to prevent prion pathogenesis only when administred simultaneously or shortly after peripheral prion infection  <cit> . it has been also reported that intracerebral injection of anti-prp igg antibodies provoked neurotoxicity by cross-linking prpc  <cit> . moreover, the treatment of human patients with rodent monoclonal antibodies is limited by the severe adverse effects due to its xenogenic origin  <cit> . recombinant human antibody fragments, may represent an effective alternative for immunotherapy of tses  <cit> . recently, by applying a biopanning-based approach, we were able to select from the eth- <dig> library human scfv phage antibodies specifically recognizing the pathological isoform of the hamster prion protein showing transcurable affinity for the prpc expressed on human cells  <cit> .

in the present article, we describe new reactive human phage antibodies with a well defined pattern of reactivity on human cell lines. these phage antibodies were isolated using an identical bioapanning-based strategy with rhaprp as a bait.

the antibody fragments retain the targeting specificity of the whole igg mabs but can be produced less expensively and possess other unique and superior properties for diagnostic and therapeutic applications  <cit> .

RESULTS
phage antibody selection
to isolate phage antibodies specific for prp protein, an aliquot of the human synthetic eth- <dig> library containing approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu phages was introduced for panning into maxisorp immunotubes coated with rhaprp. nonspecifically absorbed phages were removed by intensive washing. specific bound phages were eluted, amplified and used for next round of selection as described  <cit> . the isolated phage populations were tested in elisa and flow-cytometry after each step of biopanning. figure  <dig> shows that the binding level of polyclonal phage antibodies with rhaprp and living/intact ccrf-cem cells parallels with the progression of biopanning selections.

phage antibody characterization
after the third round of panning, polyclonal phage antibodies were amplified in tg <dig> e. coli bacteria and single colonies were picked-up and tested for rhaprp recognition in elisa. two of the most reactive clones named ma <dig> b <dig> and ma <dig> g <dig> were isolated and further characterized. molecular-genetics analysis shows that the scfvs ma <dig> g <dig> and ma <dig> b <dig> displayed on m <dig> phage are encoded by two different cdr <dig> sequences  and that scfvs displayed on phages are intact molecules of  <dig> kda . therefore, we tested the prpc specificity of the phage antibodies verifying their reactivity with hamster brain omogenates in parallel with the irrelevant phage antibodies anti glucose oxidase and anti tetanus toxoid. as shown in figure 2a, the phage antibodies ma <dig> b <dig> and ma <dig> g <dig> both react with rhaprp and hamster brain homogenates.

to eliminate concerns about specificity of the phage antibodies we utilized the cell-type specific extinction of prpc in granulocyte differentiation that can be recapitulated in vitro by all-trans retinoic acid  treatment of hl- <dig> cells  <cit> . flow-cytometry was performed in order to assess a possible relationship between the down-regulation of surface prpc and antibody staining. hl- <dig> cells were treated with atra for  <dig> hrs and stained either with the phage antibodies or with the rodent mab 3f <dig>  the figure 2b shows a decrease in membrane of prion protein expression in hl- <dig> cells treated with atra vs untreated cells when staining is performed with the mab 3f <dig> or the phage antibodies ma <dig> b <dig> and ma <dig> g <dig> 

prpc typing on human cells
prpc expression was examined with phage antibodies and mab 3f <dig> on numerous human cell lines which include lymphobastoid and myeloid cells, the neuroblastoma cell line sk-n-be, and resting or activated pbmc. as it is shown in figure  <dig>  the staining of the phage antibodies ma <dig> b <dig> and ma <dig> g <dig> show a well defined reactivity pattern.

the phage antibodies are reactive on ccrf-cem, jurkat, h <dig>  rpmi  <dig>  and hl <dig> cell lines. when compared with the mab 3f <dig>  the binding of phage antibodies is significantly different in nalm- <dig> and thp- <dig> cell lines, that react poorly or not at all with the phage antibodies. the phage antibody ma <dig> b <dig> is unable to detect prpc on the sk-n-be cell line. furthermore the two phage antibodies show different reactivity on resting and activated human pbmc. particularly ma <dig> g <dig> shows increased staining on pha-activated human pbmc in respect to resting pbmc according to results previously reported  <cit> .

these pattern of immunoreactivity may be due to the high molecular heterogeneity of prpc that only for some epitopes may be mimicked by the three dimensional structure of the recombinant prp expressed by e. coli. infact, extensive biochemical characterizations conducted with panel of mabs have demonstrated the molecular complexity of prpc proteins. over  <dig> biochemical forms each representing a distinct prpc species based on combinations of different molecular weights and isoelectric points  have been identified by 2-d immunoblot spots  <cit> . moreover previously reported data have shown that monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant human prion protein folded into alpha or beta conformations exhibit striking heterogeneity in their specificity for truncations and glycoforms of mouse brain prpc  <cit> . so it may be that one epitopes not present or buried on sk-n-be, thp <dig> and nalm  <dig> cell lines has been intercepted by the phage antibody ma <dig> b <dig> or ma <dig> g <dig> selected with rhaprp as a bait.

collectively these data suggest that the two phage antibodies do not recognize the same epitope when compared with the rodent mab 3f <dig>  and the binding properties of the newly isolated scfvs appear to be novel. furthermore the phage antibodies do not react in western blot analysis conducted with various prion protein preparations, probably for conformational structure of the target epitope . finally, ma <dig> b <dig> phage antibody appears very suitable in prpc detection in immunocytochemical analysis .

by summing up our data we can conclude that the human antibodies we isolated and characterized, are the first human phage antibodies in scfv format recognizing the prion protein expressed on the cell membrane of human cells. in fact, previously characterized human phage antibodies have not been tested on prion proteins expressed by viable human cells  <cit> . furthermore phage antibodies isolated using the pathological isoform of the hamster prion protein as a bait do not react in elisa with rhaprp, and show transcurable reactivity with prpc on ccrf-cem cells, indicating that the two classes of phage antibodies recognize distinct epitopes in the prion protein  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
several reports indicate that humoral immune responses against the prion protein can antagonize prion infections  <cit> . this is true even when such responses are directed primarily against prpc and do not selectively target the disease-associated prion protein. hence, the prospect of immunotherapy against prion diseases has received considerable attention in recent years  <cit> . to this regard, mabs specifically recognizing prion protein epitopes expressed on the cell surface of lymphoblastoid cells may represent a valuable reagent for developing anti tse's therapies. the administration of rodent monoclonal antibodies generated via hybridoma technology  <cit>  while feasible and effective presents several limitations: for example the severe adverse effects due to its xenogenic origin. for these reasons rodent monoclonal antibodies require a technically challenging and expensive genetic manipulation to generate chimeric and/or humanized mabs  <cit> . recombinant antibody fragments, for example scfv antibodies may represent an effective alternative. the antibody fragments retain the targeting specificity of whole mabs but can be produced more economically and possess other unique and superior properties for diagnostic and therapeutic applications  <cit> .

data here reported and discussed indicated that the phage antibodies isolated and characterized by us, represent useful reagents for structure/function studies of the prpc molecule and for developing an immunotherapeutic strategy against prion disease. furthermore, the genes encoding for the scfvs ma <dig> b <dig> and ma <dig> g <dig> antibodies have been isolated and sequenced, thus facilitating the delivery of scfvs by genetic transduction in vivo for sustained production of scfvs at predefined sites for prolonged periods of time  <cit> .
