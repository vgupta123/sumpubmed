BACKGROUND
cav is a small non-enveloped, single-stranded, circular dna virus and was first isolated in japan  <cit> . this virus belongs to the genus gyrovirus of the circoviridae family and causes a severe immunosuppressive syndrome and anemia in chickens  <cit> . it is a ubiquitous pathogen of chickens and has a worldwide distribution. according to epidemiological studies, it has been shown that almost all newly hatched chicks are susceptible to cav as a clinical syndrome, but not mature chickens  <cit> . normally, young chickens, generally fewer than  <dig> weeks of age, are very susceptible to this virus through vertical transmission via hatching eggs  <cit> . the virus typically induces aplasia of the bone marrow and damage to lymphoid tissue, which causes anemia and acute immunodeficiency syndrome  <cit> . up to the present, a large number of isolates, including strains from australia, bangladesh, brazil, china, germany, malaysia, nigeria, slovenia, taiwan and usa, have been reported and have had full or partial sequences published  <cit> .

the dna genome of cav is about  <dig>  kb in size  <cit>  and there are three orfs present on the negative sense genome. at least three proteins are produced from a single polycistronic  <dig>  kb mrna that is reliable produced as a single molecule and contains a promoter, tata-box, and poly  signal  <cit> . the three translated proteins are called vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig>  vp <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein that is the structure protein involved in assembly of the viral caspid  <cit> . vp <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein that contains a dual-specificity phosphatase  activity and some apoptotic activity  <cit> . however, vp2's apoptotic activity is much weaker than that of vp <dig>  vp <dig> is a  <dig> kda protein, also named apoptin, which induces apoptosis in infected chicken cells and human tumor cell lines  <cit> . during virus infection, vp <dig> and vp <dig> are detected very early, namely  <dig> h post infection, while vp <dig> is detected only after  <dig> h post infection  <cit> . some additional proteins have been reported to be translated after further splicing of the mrna, but their biological functions have not been elucidated  <cit> .

as mention above, vp <dig> is a dsp enzyme  <cit> . the key catalytic residues of active site have been identified to be serine, threonine, and tyrosine. the cysteine residues, respectively, are located at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the catalytic motif of vp <dig>  furthermore, mutation of these residues to serine results in reduced virus replication efficiency in the cell  <cit> . this effect indicates that the phosphatase activity of vp <dig> is required for virus replication. it has been reported that co-expression of vp <dig> and vp <dig> allows neutralizing antibodies to be raised  <cit>  and it has been suggested that vp <dig> is a scaffold protein  <cit>  that corrects the conformation of vp <dig>  therefore, it is expected that vp <dig> is a multifunctional protein with roles in virus infection, assembly and replication. vp <dig> possess a putative nls and the protein is known to accumulate to a large extent in the nucleus of infected chicken cells  <cit> . a recent study has shown that vp <dig>  when fused to gfp, shows nuclear localization and this result indicates that the nls of vp <dig> is also functional in plants  <cit> .

until now, the specific mechanism for the cellular localization of vp <dig> is not well understood. in this study, we first use bioinformatics to analysis the amino acid sequence of various different isolates of vp <dig>  and were able to predict and examine for the presence of putative nls and nes motifs, which have never been characterized previously. we generated gfp fused to various versions of vp <dig> created by truncation, site directed mutagenesis, and multiple site directed mutagenesis in order to confirm the locations of these putative nls and nes sequences. leptomycin b  can be used to identify the presence of a nes motif in a protein because it inhibits the crm <dig> pathway and such a result has been found for vp <dig> of cav. using lmb, our results suggest that vp <dig> does not contain a functional nes and also that vp <dig> is crm <dig> independent. additionally, using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we also found that vp <dig> associates with mcm <dig> and that this interaction does not require dsp activity.

RESULTS
localization of vp <dig> in mammalian cells
in previous studies, it has been shown by indirect immunoperoxidase staining that vp <dig> is localized within the nuclei of mdcc-msb  <dig> cells infected with cav  <cit> . in  <dig>  lacorte et al. reported that transient expression of gfp-vp <dig> could be observed throughout the nucleoplasm in plant cells  <cit> . in the present study, we constructed expression plasmids of vp2-gfp in order to identify the nuclear localizing characteristics in cells. after transient transfection, the bright fluorescence of vp2-gfp was observed mostly in the nucleus of both hela and cho cells. in contrast, when gfp alone was introduced, not only the nucleus but also the cytoplasm was fluorescent. this indicates that a functional nls was present in vp <dig> as suggested by previously .

using bioinformatics to predict the nls and nes containing regions
in order to identify if there are any nls or nes motifs in vp <dig>  we first compared the amino acid sequence of vp <dig>  with a range of other cav isolates to explore the protein's sequence divergence. the various vp <dig> sequences of the different cav isolates were obtained from the uniprotkb database . based on the sequence alignment, the vp <dig> proteins of these cav isolates are highly conserved compared to strain cia- <dig> from taiwan. therefore, the full length of amino acid sequence of vp <dig>  was used and examined in order to predict nls sequences using the wolf psort and nlstradamus programs . a bipartite nls motif  was predicted by the wolf psort program, with the putative motif position spanned amino acid residues from  <dig> to  <dig> . however, a monopartite nls motif  was also predicted by nlstradamus at a prediction cutoff value at  <dig>  and this motif was located from amino acid residues from  <dig> to  <dig> . based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, vp <dig> was predicted to containing two possible nls motifs. in addition, the nes motif prediction was performed by netnes  <dig>  server . a putative nes from amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig>  was pinpointed. however, the expected value for nes prediction was lower than threshold expected value of this program, which suggests that there is a low probability of a nes motif existing within vp <dig>  based on these results, further investigations were needed to elucidate whether or not a nes is functional in vp <dig> 

identification of binls <dig> function in vp2
as mentioned above, two putative nls motifs, a bipartite binls <dig> and a monopartite nls <dig> were predicted to be present in vp <dig>  to determine the exactly site of the nls motif in vp <dig>  we constructed a full length clone and six deletion clones of vp <dig> fused with gfp at the c-terminus . the subcellular locations of these expressed constructs in the transfected cells based on the gfp distribution pattern at  <dig> h post-transfection were examined. the truncated c-terminal deletion of vp2-gfp fusion proteins were vp <dig> 115dc, vp <dig> 132dc, and vp <dig> 145dc. the n-terminal deletion mutants were vp <dig> 111dn, vp <dig> 141dn, and vp <dig> 160dn. in figure 3b, two of the c-terminal deletions, vp <dig> 115dc, and vp <dig> 132dc showed fluorescence distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of hela cells , whereas the bright fluorescence of these two truncations was predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm of cho cells . fluorescence due to vp <dig> 145dc was localized in the nucleus of both hela and cho cells . furthermore, vp <dig> 111dn was also localized to the nucleus of hela and cho cells . in contrast, fluorescence by vp <dig> 141dn and vp <dig> 160dn was found to have a very similar pattern to that of gfp in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of hela and cho cells .

on comparing the fluorescence distribution patterns of vp <dig> 111dn and vp <dig> 141dn in mammalian cells, we found that the c-terminus part of binls <dig> from vp <dig> did not seem to contain a nuclear import function. to support this finding, we used site directed mutagenesis to create a series of binls <dig> mutants, namely vp <dig> 150-152a , vp <dig> 136-138a  and vp <dig> 136-138a/150-152a, as shown in table  <dig>  all of these mutants were able to express and were localized to the nucleus of hela and cho cells . the results indicated that nls motif did not include the whole putative region of binls <dig> as predicted by bioinformatics.

the nuclear localization signal is within the nls <dig> motif of vp2
next, we focused on nls <dig> motif in order to characterize the nls motif within vp <dig>  the vp <dig> 132dc mutant produced fluorescence that was distributed across both the nucleus and cytoplasm of hela cells and in the cytoplasm of cho cells. in contrast, the fluorescence produced by vp <dig> 145dc was localized to the nucleus of hela and cho cells. these results indicate that nls motif of vp <dig> would seem to span amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig>  this region contains the nls <dig> motif, which covers amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig>  we changed the positive charge of amino acids from  <dig> to  <dig> residues to alanine and measured the distribution of gfp. we found that the nuclear localization of gfp fluorescence of the vp <dig> 136-138a mutants within this region was not abolished. however, our results indicated the presence of critical amino acid residues within the nls motif of vp <dig> that play an essential role in nuclear transport. specifically, alanine substitution mutagenesis at positions k133a and r134a of vp <dig> and of the vp <dig> 136-138a clone was carried out to further characterize the nuclear localization motif and the results were summarized in table  <dig>  these results were shown that nuclear transportation of vp <dig> was obviously disrupted in three alanine substitution constructs, namely vp <dig> 136-138a/133a, vp <dig> 136-138a/134a, and vp <dig> 136-138a/133a/134a  but not in vp <dig> 133a, vp <dig> 134a and vp <dig> 133a/134a . the gfp signal distributions of vp2-gfp and its mutants in cho cells are shown in figures 1b and 4b and these were analyzed quantitatively by using alpha view® software . vp2-gfp was 94% of the time in nucleus and 6% in cytosol. the nuclear presence of the vp <dig> 136-138a/133a, vp <dig> 136-138a/134a, and vp <dig> 136-138a/133a/134a mutant was reduced to 13%, 12% and 11%, respectively, with most of gfp signal accumulated in the cytoplasm. these findings demonstrate that nls <dig> is a functional nls motif in vp <dig> and that amino acid residues k <dig> and r <dig> are also important to this functionality .

vp <dig> is a crm <dig> independent protein
typical nes motifs have been found in the various viral and cellular proteins and are involved in transportation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm  <cit> . lmb has been shown to interfere with the crm1-nes interaction and can be used to verify the functionality of any nes motif. a weak putative nes motif spanning amino acid residues from  <dig> to  <dig> of vp <dig> was predicted earlier . however, the prediction score was lower than the program threshold. the weak putative nes motif was investigated using the truncated mutants shown in figure 3a together with lmb   and lmb   buffers, which were added to cells at  <dig> h post-transfection and incubated for  <dig> h  <cit> . vp3-gfp was used as a positive control because it has been reported to be a crm <dig> dependent protein and contains a nes motif  <cit> . the distribution of fluorescence was then observed  and the results demonstrated that, while lmb was able to affect the nuclear export of vp <dig>  it had no effect on vp <dig>  therefore it would seem that vp <dig> nuclear export is a crm <dig> independent process and that there is no functional nes motif present in vp <dig> 

vp <dig> binds to chromatin
as previously reported and confirmed by this study, vp2-gfp predominantly is localized in nucleus . in order to further investigate this localization, cho cells were transfected with vp2-gfp plasmid and the resulting cell extract separated into soluble and chromatin fractions. as is shown in figure 6a, vp2-gfp could be detected in both the soluble and chromatin fractions. the chromatin fraction was further digested with micrococcal nuclease . like mcm <dig>  vp2-gfp was only partial dissociated from the chromatin fraction after treatment with mnase, which suggested that vp <dig> is a chromatin-bound protein and mnase-resistant. the chromatin fraction was also treated with different concentration of nacl. the result is shown in figure 6a, whereby vp2-gfp was found to be slightly dissociation at  <dig>  m nacl and  <dig>  m nacl, but a significant amount of remaining protein remained bound to the chromatin. when tested under similar conditions, the lamin b receptor, a nuclear matrix protein, was not extracted by  <dig>  m nacl and  <dig>  m nacl. therefore, these results strongly suggest that vp <dig>  like mcm <dig>  is a chromatin binding protein, but was not a nuclear matrix protein.

the dsp activity of vp <dig> is not required for protein-protein interaction with mcm3
in a previous study, the dsp activity of vp <dig> was shown to be needed for virus replication in the cell  <cit> . in order to address what proteins in the various dna replication complexes interacts with vp <dig> in cells, an independent assay involving immunoprecipitation using anti-flag m <dig> beads against flag-vp2-gfp was employed. in the control experiments, gfp expressing plasmids were transfected into cells and it was found that no none-specific proteins were brought down by the flag m <dig> beads using western blot detection . on the other hand, flag-vp2-gfp was co-immunoprecipited with mcm <dig> protein by the flag m <dig> beads  when compared to the protein band in the flag-vp2-gfp nuclear extract . in contrast, other components of dna replication complexes such as cdc <dig>  pcna and condensin smc <dig>  as well as the core histones such as h2b, were not co-immunoprecipited with vp <dig> using cho cell extracts . the above results confirmed that vp <dig> associates with mcm <dig> when it binds to chromatin.

to identify whether the dual phosphatase activity of vp <dig> was needed for association with mcm <dig>  we performed a site directed mutagenesis assay targeting position c <dig> and c <dig> of vp <dig> in order to create the single mutants c95s and c97s and the double mutant c95s/c97s, which have either partial or complete disruption of the dsp activity associated with vp <dig>  <cit> . co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out and, the results are shown in figure 6c, mcm <dig> was co-immunoprecipitated by the three mutants of vp <dig> protein in a similar manner to the wild type protein, which shows that vp <dig> binding to mcm <dig> does not require dual-phosphatase activity .

discussion
cav is an important avian pathogen worldwide and causes major economic damage throughout the poultry industry. three major proteins are encoded by this virus, namely the capsid protein vp <dig>  the nonstructural protein vp <dig>  and the apoptin vp <dig>  however, up to the present, the exactly functions of these three proteins in cell are still poorly understood. in previous studies, the expression of vp <dig> was found to be nuclear in plant cells  <cit> . this result is similar to that of the present study, where, vp <dig> was found to accumulate in the nucleus of both hela and cho cells. our results, both by bioinformatics and site-directed mutagenesis, support the hypothesis that vp <dig> contain a nls and named as nsl <dig>  nls <dig> was shown to be a functional nls that allowed transfer of vp <dig> into nucleus. this is similar to vp <dig>  which has two functional nls motifs that are also used for nuclear localization. the single vp <dig> nls motif spans amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig>  within this motif, we also found that two amino acids with positive charges, 133r and  <dig> k were important to allowing vp <dig> protein to shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report identifying a nls motif in the vp <dig> of cav.

subsequent sequence analysis showed that vp <dig> might contain a putative crm1-mediated nes motif that stretched from amino acid  <dig> to amino acid  <dig>  however the scores for this motif was below the program threshold. in order to confirm that a nes motif really existed in vp <dig>  we used fusion protein constructs to investigate nuclear transportation in the presence of lmb assay . a control protein, namely vp <dig>  also named apoptin, which contains a classical leucine-rich nes motif and has been previously described as sensitive to lmb treatment was included in the study  <cit> . our results confirmed that the cytoplasm and nuclear distribution of the various truncated vp <dig> mutants was not obviously changed in pattern after treatment with lmb. this supports two possibilities; firstly, that the nuclear export pathway  of vp <dig> might not exist and/or, secondly, that a distinct and crm <dig> dependent pathway was adopted by vp <dig> for nuclear export.

vp <dig> has been shown to contain dual phosphatase activity and this activity is required for cav replication  <cit> . however, in this context, very little is known about the role this protein plays in the regulation of viral dna replication. when cells are infected with cav, vp <dig> is expressed and accumulates, reaching a detectable level at  <dig> h post-infection  <cit> . in contrast, vp <dig> has been found to accumulate to a higher level at  <dig> h post-infection. amino acids sequence analysis of cav vp <dig> was revealed that the n-terminal region show similarity to protamines  <cit> , this supports the hypothesis that vp <dig> has dna-binding functionality  <cit> . the n and c-terminal domains of vp <dig> separately bind to dna and indicating the presence of multiple independent binding sites  <cit> . however, vp <dig> protein has no obvious dna binding characteristics. in this study, vp <dig> of cav is shown to be localized to the nucleus in two cell lines  and also to bind to chromatin . the latter finding was confirmed by examining the nuclease-resistant fraction and by treating with high salt. vp <dig> is similar to mcm <dig>  a component of various mcm2- <dig> complexes, and other nuclease-resistant chromatin bound proteins such as cdc <dig>  <cit> , minichromosome maintenance proteins   <cit> , and pcna  <cit> , all of which have chromatin-bound characteristics. this suggests that the early expression of vp <dig> might involve dna replication with vp <dig> interacting with the prereplication complex . the association of vp <dig> with mcm <dig>  may facilitate the dna replication of cav. however, it is still unknown whether vp <dig> is able to bind to dna directly and this will need further investigation. moreover, vp2's association with mcm <dig> does not require dual phosphatase activity  and therefore, the relevance of vp2's dsp activity to the live cycle of cav also needs further investigation.

rep, a viral protein with replicase activity involved in regulating rolling-circle replication , has been found in most circovirus members of the family circoviridae  <cit> . cav seems to lack a rep protein. however, some studies have proposed that the c-terminus of cav vp <dig> contains a highly conserved rcr motif and that this may play a role in regulating the rcr reaction  <cit> . this rcr-regulating function of vp <dig> seems to be very similar to that of the rep protein. therefore, vp <dig> may interact with vp <dig> to form a nucleoprotein complex and, in addition, the genomic dna of the virus might also be coupled with vp <dig> and vp <dig> in order to regulate the rcr reaction during the early stages of infection. however, these hypotheses need to be investigated in terms of how the mcms interact with the vp <dig> of cav.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the vp <dig> of cav contains a functional nls motif that spans amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of the protein. in addition to having a nls, vp <dig> is also a chromatin binding protein similar to members of the mcm2- <dig> complex. moreover, vp <dig> associates with mcm <dig> in cells based on co-immunoprecipitation analysis. taken together, these findings suggest that vp <dig> may be part of a dna pre-replication complex.
