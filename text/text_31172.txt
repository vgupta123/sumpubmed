BACKGROUND
as a powerful tool in genomic research, microarray technology has been widely used for simultaneously monitoring expression levels of tens of thousands of genes  <cit> . the affymetrix genechip® system is a commonly used platform for microarray analysis but the technology is inherently expensive. we noticed that unforeseeable changes in experimental planning and execution, e.g., unavailability of previously anticipated samples or a shift in research focus could render pre-purchased genechip® microarrays unprocessed before their manufacturer’s expiration dates. therefore, it is important to know whether the expired but expensive genechip® microarrays are still useful and reliable in gene expression studies.

a critical goal in the application of microarray technology is to identify differentially expressed genes  between sample groups under different conditions. however, several studies showed poor overlaps of degs across different platforms or different laboratories using the same sets of rna samples  <cit> , raising concerns on the reliability of microarray technology  <cit>  and leading to the launch of the microarray quality control  project  <cit> . the maqc project systematically evaluated the reliability of microarray technology by profiling two human reference rna samples  in different laboratories using different microarray and qpcr platforms. the maqc consortium proposed to use fold change ranking combined with a non-stringent p-value cutoff for deg selection and the percentage of overlapping genes  for evaluation of the reproducibility of degs between different experiments. excellent inter-laboratory and inter-platform reproducibility in terms of deg lists was observed in the maqc project  <cit> .

in the current study, we assessed the consistency between gene expression data generated with expired and unexpired affymetrix microarrays using the same batches of maqc samples and a similar data analysis approach as proposed by the maqc project. our results showed good reproducibility in terms of deg lists between the expired and unexpired microarrays. at the same time, we also observed a high level of reproducibility between deg lists from data generated in  <dig> and those newly generated in  <dig> with the same type of unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays, suggesting a good degree of stability of the two maqc reference rna samples stored at -80°c over a period of four years.

RESULTS
study design and data generation
we designed and conducted a comparative study to answer the question whether gene expression data generated with affymetrix u133a microarrays, four years past their expiration date, are useful and reliable. figure  <dig> depicts the overview of the study, the experimental procedures, data used, and comparative analyses applied. two sources of data were used in this study: gene expression data newly generated in  <dig> specifically for this study and data generated by the maqc project in  <dig> 

the new gene expression data were generated with  <dig> microarrays  . three replicates for each of the two maqc samples  were profiled in  <dig> by using both the expired u133a microarrays  and the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. in addition, gene expression data generated with unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays , other microarray platforms, and taqman® assays by the maqc project in  <dig> were used as references to assess the stability of the maqc samples stored at -80°c for four years by comparing new microarray data with those obtained four years ago. the maqc reference data also allowed for further evaluation of the usefulness of the data generated with expired u133a microarrays.

it should be pointed out that in the current study the observed differences between the expired and unexpired affymetrix microarrays were confounded with the use of two different types of genechip® microarrays, u133a  and u133plus <dig> . however, the probe design  for these two types of genechip® microarrays is identical and the consistency of data between the two types of microarrays was demonstrated by the manufacturer . therefore, the observed difference between expired u133a and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays can be attributed mainly to the expiration of the former.

stability of the two maqc samples over a period of four years
the two maqc human reference rna samples, from the same batches as used in the maqc project in  <dig> but stored at -80°c for over four years, were labeled and hybridized in  <dig> on expired u133a and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. before comparing data from the expired and unexpired microarrays, it is necessary to verify the stability of the maqc samples through assessing the consistency between gene expression data generated in  <dig> and in  <dig> using the same type of unexpired affymetrix u133plus <dig> microarrays.

repeatability of intensity data among sample replicates on expired microarrays
the probe-level raw intensity data were first summarized and normalized with the rma algorithm  <cit>  and then transformed to log <dig> scale. figures 3a and 3b show the correlation of the log <dig> gene expression intensities for the  <dig>  common genes between replicates on the expired u133a and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays, respectively. for the expired u133a microarrays , the replicates of the same sample showed a high level of correlation similar to what was observed for the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays . more quantitatively, the average correlation coefficients of the log <dig> intensities among the replicates of sample a were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the expired and unexpired microarrays, respectively. for sample b, the corresponding average correlation coefficients were  <dig>  and  <dig>  from the expired and unexpired microarrays, respectively . these results demonstrated a high level of intra-sample repeatability of absolute gene expression data from expired u133a microarrays.

comparison of log <dig> fold changes detected with expired u133a and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays
to address the issue of using expired microarrays, the log <dig> fold changes of data obtained with the expired u133a microarrays and the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays were compared . the log <dig> fold changes for most genes were consistent in the direction of regulation . however, there was a slight fold change compression  <cit>  for the data obtained with the expired u133a microarrays. that is, the magnitude of differential expression  for the same gene measured from the expired u133a microarrays  was lower than that from the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays . 

the percentage of overlapping genes with the same directional change in expression was  <dig> %  when no p-value cutoff was applied to either experiment . the overlap increased to  <dig> %  when genes were retained for comparison as long as a p <  <dig>  criterion was met in either one of the two experiments , a fair scenario for comparing two data sets. when the comparison was restricted to the subset of  <dig>  genes that were simultaneously detected to be significantly differentially expressed  in both experiments, the overlap increased to  <dig> %. that is, only one gene showed opposite regulation directionalities between expired u133a microarrays and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. these results suggested that the degs detected by the expired u133a microarrays were highly consistent with those by the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. 

comparison between expired u133a microarrays with multiple microarray platforms used in the maqc project
microarray data generated in  <dig> with the same maqc samples from five platforms, applied biosystems , affymetrix u133plus <dig> , agilent , illumina , and ge healthcare  by the maqc project  <cit>  were used as references to further assess the usefulness of the expired u133a microarrays. to assess the concordance between two experiments, we first used a p <  <dig>  cutoff to eliminate genes separately in each experiment and then rank-ordered the remaining genes by log <dig> fcs. in one experiment, genes ranked higher in either the up- or down-regulation direction are selected as degs first. figure  <dig> shows the relationship between the pog and the number of selected degs, wherein genes with smaller fcs are selected when more genes are chosen as degs. the red line represented the average pog between deg lists of each of the four reference microarray data sets in the maqc project  and the reference affymetrix u133plus <dig>  data, all generated in  <dig>  this reference line and its confidence limits can be used to judge the statistical significance between any two experiments, e.g., between expired u133a microarrays and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. 

the concordance between deg lists selected from expired u133a microarrays and unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays  were about 70% when the number of selected degs was as few as  <dig>  these pog numbers increased to near 90% when more genes were selected as differentially expressed. for the same number of degs, the pogs between expired u133a  and unexpired u133plus <dig>  microarrays, and between expired u133a  and the reference u133plus <dig>  microarrays were on the upper confidence limit of the reference line. this means that compared to data from the reference afx microarrays , the degs generated with expired u133a microarrays  are more consistent than those from other unexpired, but different microarray platforms  in  <dig>  in addition, the pog between the unexpired u133plus <dig>  and the reference afx microarrays  was the highest, again, suggesting that the maqc samples were relatively stable. 

comparison between expired u133a microarrays and taqman® assays
taqman® assays have been widely used in gene expression profiling and are generally considered as a good reference for evaluating other gene expression techniques. in this study, the taqman® gene expression data generated by the maqc project in  <dig> using the same maqc samples  <cit>  were used to further assess the usefulness of the expired u133a microarrays based on data from the  <dig> genes that were probed by both the microarrays and taqman® assays. the deg lists obtained from expired u133a microarrays , unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays , and microarrays from abi, afx, ag <dig>  ilm, and geh  were separately compared with those from the taqman® assays performed in  <dig>  <cit> . the mean pog of the deg lists between the taqman® assays and the microarray platforms  was shown as a reference line . the pog between the expired u133a microarrays  and the taqman® assays  was close to the reference line when the number of degs was as low as  <dig> but was about 10% lower than the reference line when all genes meeting the p <  <dig>  criterion were selected . in addition, the pog between unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays  and taqman® assays  and the pog between the afx  and taqman® assays  were higher than, or at the same level as, the reference line. that is, compared to unexpired microarrays, expired u133a microarrays exhibited a slightly decreased ability to detect differential gene expression, mainly due to the fold change compression that made the rankings of genes with smaller fold changes more variable. 

characteristics of gene expression data measured on unexpired u133plus <dig> and expired u133a microarrays
the lower sensitivity of the expired u133a microarrays in detecting differential gene expression could be explained by a decrease in microarray signal or an increase in the scaling factor . the average scaling factor was  <dig>  for the expired u133a microarrays and  <dig>  for the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. the higher scaling factor for the expired microarrays indicates that compared to the unexpired microarrays, the quality of hybridization signals from the expired microarrays was somewhat compromised, leading to a decrease in sensitivity. 

discussion
many users of microarrays face time pressures to complete their studies while staying within the expiration dates on the microarrays. moreover, it is important to understand the stability of rna samples after years of storage. our current study investigated the stability of two maqc human reference rna samples and examined the reliability of expired affymetrix u133a microarrays in gene expression analyses. we compared the gene expression data of expired and unexpired microarrays from three aspects: absolute expression intensities, log <dig> fold changes, and the pog of deg lists, using data newly generated in  <dig> with the same pair of reference rna samples used in  <dig> by the maqc project. in addition, the gene expression data generated using different platforms  in  <dig> by the maqc project were used as references to evaluate the reliability of the expired u133a microarrays and also to assess the stability of the maqc samples.

based on the log <dig> fold changes, microarray data generated in  <dig> were highly consistent  with those generated by the maqc project in  <dig> using exactly the same type of unexpired affymetrix u133plus <dig> microarrays and with the same pair of rna samples that had been stored at -80°c for over four years . moreover, when compared with the taqman® assay data generated by the maqc project in  <dig>  the two sets of data  from unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays showed similar results . our comparative analyses indicated that the microarray data generated in  <dig> from the same pair of maqc rna samples were reliable and that the rna samples used in this study were reasonably stable after a period of at least four years. therefore, it is a reasonable strategy to use these samples for assessing the reliability of the expired u133a microarrays.

despite appreciable fold change compression,  <dig> % genes identified from expired u133a microarrays as differentially expressed were consistent in the direction of regulation with those from unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays when the comparison was restricted to those genes with p <  <dig>  in at least one experiment . these results suggested that the degs detected by the expired u133a microarrays were highly compatible with those identified by the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays. our comparative analyses also showed that the deg lists generated with the expired u133a microarrays were more reproducible than those from other unexpired microarray platforms  in  <dig> when compared to the deg lists from unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays in  <dig>  and in  <dig> . that is, the level of concordance between expired and unexpired affymetrix microarrays is higher than the level of concordance between unexpired affymetrix microarrays and microarrays from other different platforms.

the pog of the deg lists from the expired u133a microarrays and the taqman® assays was ~10% lower than the average pog of the deg lists between the unexpired microarrays and taqman® assays . the number of degs detected by the expired u133a microarrays was lower than that by the unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays and the magnitude of the differential gene expression  detected by expired u133a microarrays was also lower. 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, two human reference rna samples, established and used in the maqc project four years ago, were used to assess a) the stability of these reagents and b) the reliability of data generated on affymetrix’s u133a microarrays expired four years ago. by comparing the detected log <dig> fold changes and the pog between the deg lists from unexpired affymetrix u133plus <dig> microarrays in  <dig> and in  <dig>  we first demonstrated that the reference rna samples were relatively stable and in reasonably good quality. comparative analyses showed a reasonable level of consistency in deg lists between the expired and unexpired microarrays. comparison between deg lists from expired u133a microarrays and taqman® assays showed a decrease in sensitivity of expired u133a microarrays by approximately 10%. in addition to possible sample-related reasons, the increase of scaling factors, the shrinkage of the distribution of detected raw intensities, and the lower percentage of present calls indicate a decrease in detection sensitivity for the expired microarrays. our results suggested that the affymetrix u133a microarrays expired four years ago generated useful, but somewhat less sensitive, data for identifying genes differentially expressed. it is warranted to continue to monitor the stability and integrity of the maqc reference rna samples because of their wide applications by the gene expression community.
