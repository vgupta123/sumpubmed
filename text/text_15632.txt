BACKGROUND
spherical baculovirosis is a shrimp disease that was first observed in taiwan, and it was also the first reported viral disease from penaeus monodon
 <cit> 
. the viral pathogen that causes this disease is now widely distributed along the indo-pacific coasts of asia, and it infects a range of penaeid shrimps. the virus is a rod-shaped, singly enveloped and occluded large circular dsdna virus that replicates within the nucleus, and it targets several organs, including the hepatopancreatic tubule epithelium and duct epithelium of postlarvae, juveniles and adults, and the anterior midgut epithelium of very young postlarvae  <cit> .

when it was first discovered in  <dig>  it was thought to be a baculovirus because of the structure of its occlusion bodies as revealed by electron microscopy  <cit> . two years later, it was designated monodon baculovirus   <cit> , and this name is still commonly used today. one decade after its discovery, mari et al. showed that each envelope contained a single nucleocapsid, and that numerous virions were included within each occlusion body. mari et al. therefore proposed that mbv be assigned to the subgenus snpv with the name pmsnpv  <cit> . later still, from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the 8th report of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , penaeus monodon nucleopolyhedrovirus  was listed as a “tentative species” in the nucleopolyhedrovirus genus. meanwhile, even though the virus forms occlusion bodies, in  <dig>  wang and jehle used a molecular phylogenetic analysis of six viral genes and supermatrix methods to propose that this virus should to be re-assigned to the genus nudivirus. they also proposed that it be renamed to p. monodon nudivirus, pmnv  <cit> . although the taxonomic status of this virus is still in dispute, and it is not included in the 9th ictv report , the evidence we present here supports this proposed reassignment, and we will use this new name throughout the present manuscript.

before the present study, only a  <dig>  kb partial pmnv genome sequence was available in genbank. to further clarify its phylogenetic status, we used an ngs  platform to determine the complete genome sequence of pmnv, and then analyzed and compared its genomic features with other closely related species. we also investigated the unique properties of the polyhedrin that forms pmnv’s occlusion bodies. our results suggest that pmnv is not a baculovirus, and we propose that it should be assigned to a third genus, gammanudivirus, within the newly proposed nudiviridae family  <cit> .

RESULTS
sequencing of the pmnv genome
the complete pmnv genome was sequenced by an illumina miseq sequencer using the paired-end method. high-throughput sequencing was performed twice to compare between different sample preparation methods and sequencing conditions. the longest contigs from the first and the second sequencing were  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt, respectively. however, high-throughput ngs sequencing can produce nucleotide errors, while the short sequences used by ngs can lead to repetitive errors in assembly. therefore, based on the longest contig, we designed  <dig> primers  and used sanger sequencing to recheck sequences that had unreliable signals. a total of  <dig> runs were assembled into a single contiguous sequence with a size of  <dig>  bp. comparisons of this sequence with the two high-throughput contigs found a 1 nt insertion and a total of 211 nt deletions in the contig from the first high-throughput sequencing, and  <dig> nucleotide errors and 556 nt deletions in the contig from the second high-throughput sequencing .

although the second sequencing produced about 3 × more data than the first, its mapping rate was about 3 × lower, and overall, the mappable reads were almost the same . since these two high-throughput sequencings were performed on samples of viral genomic dna with different purity and concentration, the similarity of the two sequencing results therefore suggests that good results can be obtained even when the sample is contaminated with host dna as long as there is sufficient coverage for accurate assembly.

we conclude that the complete circular genome of pmnv is  <dig>  bp in size. this length is in good agreement with the 80-160 kb estimated by bamhi digestion  <cit> . the pmnv genome has a g + c content of  <dig> %, which is lower than the g + c content of the type species of the baculoviruses  and all but one of the four nudiviruses .table  <dig>

repetitive sequences in the pmnv genome
homology regions  are an important feature in the genomes of many dsdna viruses. these regions, which are at-rich and consist of direct repeats with imperfect palindrome sequences, play a central role in replication  and also act as transcriptional enhancers  <cit> . hrs vary in length, sequence and copy number between species, and most of the baculoviruses have several hrs distributed around their respective genomes. notable exceptions include trichoplusia ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit> , chrysodeixis chalcites nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit>  and agrotis segetum granuloviruses   <cit> , none of which have any hrs. to date, no hrs have been found in any of the fully sequenced nudiviruses, ie. hznv- <dig>   <cit> , hznv- <dig>   <cit> , gbnv   <cit>  and ornv   <cit> . the pmnv genome also does not include any hrs. like the nudiviruses, however, it does include a number of tandem direct repeats . four of these repeats  cluster together between locations  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the pmnv genome, which is predicted to be a non-coding region . the repeat unit, copy number and total length of the repeats range from  <dig> to 42 bp,  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig> to 284 bp, respectively, which means that repeat sequences are less abundant in pmnv than in, for example, hznv- <dig>  taken together, these results suggest that pmnv and the nudiviruses might have a replication origin pattern which is distinct from the baculoviruses.figure  <dig>

gene parity analysis
gene parity plots that compared the gene organization of pmnv’s predicted orfs with those of two representative nudivirus species, hznv- <dig> and ornv, showed no significantly similar pattern of gene location within the respective genomes . however, gene parity is not generally conserved in either baculoviruses or nudiviruses, and we note that the conserved gene cluster of helicase and pif- <dig>  that is found in the known nudiviruses  <cit>  was in fact also detected in the pmnv genome  though in opposite orientation . this suggests that pmnv has a closer evolutionary relationship to the nudiviruses than to other large dsdna viruses.

functional and phylogenetic analysis of pmnv putative orfs that are homologous to baculovirus  genes
enzymes involved in dna replication
the pmnv genome includes two orfs, pmnv <dig>  and pmnv <dig> , that are involved in dna replication and play essential roles in dna polymerization and dna unwinding, respectively. two other enzymes lef- <dig> and lef- <dig>  which are factors essential for primase activity in baculoviruses, did not have any homologs in pmnv.

pmnv <dig> was predicted to belong to the dna polymerase type-b family, and it has the polbc signature from 151- <dig> aa . the closest matches for pmnv <dig> are the dna polymerases of hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig>  which both have 26% amino acid identity . dna polymerase is a key enzyme in virus taxonomy, and it has often been used to construct phylogenetic trees of dna viruses. in figure 2a, the putative pmnv dna polymerase protein sequence  was aligned with dna polymerase sequences from closely related dsdna viruses, including baculoviruses, nudiviruses and hytrosaviruses , and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. each node had a high bootstrap support percentage, indicating that this tree was reliable. pmnv was on a branch that was distant from the baculoviruses and closely related to the nudiviruses, which is consistent with the result reported by wang and jehle  <cit>  for the partial pmnv genome sequence. except for hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig>  the tree lengths show that there are greater evolutionary distances between the nudiviruses than between the baculoviruses.table  <dig>

pmnv <dig> showed 28% identity with helicase from hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig>  and was predicted to contain the primase_cte domain . in the phylogenetic tree based on the helicase protein sequences of baculoviruses and nudiviruses, which also had a high bootstrap support percentage at each node, pmnv again formed a cluster with hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig> . as with dnapol, evolutionary distances between the nudiviruses and pmnv are still greater than those within the baculoviruses.

rna polymerase subunits and an rna transcription initiation factor
five putative genes, pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig>  and pmnv <dig> , are homologous to those involved in baculovirus transcription. these genes are expressed in the late or very late infection stage, and they play different transcriptional roles. lef- <dig> is a transcription initiation factor  <cit> , while p <dig>  lef- <dig>  lef- <dig> and lef- <dig> are rna polymerase subunits. although p <dig> and lef- <dig> are fused into a single gene in hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig>  all five of the genes in the transcriptional group are conserved between the baculoviruses and nudiviruses , which suggests that the baculoviruses and nudiviruses share a similar mode of transcription.for the phylogenetic analysis , the protein sequences of lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  lef- <dig> and p <dig> from the nudiviruses and selected baculoviruses were arranged sequentially and then aligned. in this tree, pmnv also formed a cluster with the nudiviruses. the tree showed a relatively large evolutionary distance between the baculovirus cluster and the nudivirus cluster.

genes involved in oral infectivity
pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig>  and pmnv <dig>  were homologous to genes involved in per os infection. these seven genes are conserved across the baculoviruses and nudiviruses, and they are all essential for the occlusion derived virus  infectivity of the baculoviruses, either by specific binding to the midgut cells   <cit>  or by a mechanism that has not yet been determined  . although pif- <dig> was shown not to be involved in specific attachment and fusion  <cit> , deletion of its n-terminal nuclear localization signal prevents per os infectivity  <cit> .

the shared importance of these per os infectivity factors implies that despite the absence of obs in the nudiviruses, these viruses nevertheless all share a very similar oral infection mechanism. moreover, four homologous genes that have relatively high identity and similarity  are also found in the hytrosaviruses, indicating that the baculoviruses, nudiviruses and hytrosaviruses all have the same important ancestral conserved model for virus infectivity. interestingly, blastp search showed that pmnv <dig>  most closely matched macrobrachium nudivirus  pif- <dig>  with an identity of 66%. to date, only one other mrnuv gene has been sequenced , but we note that unlike the other insect nudiviruses, both pmnv and mrnuv are aquatic viruses, and it is possible that these two viruses - perhaps together with penaeus vannamei single nucleopolyhedrovirus, pvsnpv - are quite closely related.

the constructed phylogenic tree of the oral infectivity genes p <dig>  pif- <dig>  pif- <dig> and pif- <dig>  is similar to the dna polymerase and helicase trees, providing further evidence that pmnv is more closely related to the nudiviruses than the baculoviruses.

proteins related to viral packaging, assembly, and release
there are  <dig> baculovirus core genes involved in viral structure formation, but only four of these genes have homologs that could be found in the pmnv genome: p <dig> , vp <dig> , vlf- <dig>  and 38 k  . the pmnv genome even lacks a homolog to vp <dig>  which is found in the nudiviruses and is thought to encode the major capsid protein  <cit> .

p <dig> is a component of the occluded virions of acmnpv, cuninpv  and hzsnpv  . acmnpv p <dig> has been shown to interact with the human tumor suppressor p <dig> to enhance p53-induced apoptosis  <cit> . however, while acmnpv p <dig> also interacts with spodoptera frugiperda p <dig>  and oxidizes sfp <dig> in vitro, it does not enhance sfp53-mediated apoptosis in sf <dig> cells  <cit> . acmnpv p <dig> has also been demonstrated to have sulfhydryl oxidase activity  <cit>  and it is required for budded virus production and for the formation of multiply enveloped occlusion-derived nucleocapsids  <cit> . vp <dig> is expressed at the late stage of viral infection and is present in the capsid structure of opmnpv   <cit> . vlf- <dig> is expressed at the very late stage and is involved in the production of the acmnpv nucleocapsid  <cit> . gene 38 k is essential for budded virus formation and the nucleocapsid assembly of acmnpv  <cit> . taken together, the low number of homologs in this functional group indicates that the baculoviruses and nudiviruses are highly divergent in terms of their viral structural proteins.

proteins of unknown function
the best match to pmnv <dig> was the ac81-like protein of hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig>  . in bmnpv , the ac <dig> homolog  is a non-structural protein of unknown function that interacts with host actin  <cit> . the protein sequence encoded by pmnv <dig> was predicted to have a transmembrane domain by smart, and pfam found a partial match  in the eukaryotic rhd <dig> protein .

non-core acmnpv genes
we found four other putative pmnv orfs homologous to baculovirus genes that are not included in the  <dig> core genes: pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig>  .

methyltransferase is expressed in the late phase of infection and has cap o-dependent methytransferase activity  <cit> . however, deletion studies with methyltransferase-defective acmnpv have shown that it is not essential for the budded virus or for occluded virus production, and that it has no effect on acmnpv  <cit> .

the pmnv genome has two neighboring orfs with the same orientation  that are homologous to odv-e <dig>  odv-e <dig> is a late expression, structural component of occluded-derived virus  envelopes  <cit> . the n-terminus of odv-e <dig> contains a highly hydrophobic inm-sorting  motif that traffics acmnpv viral proteins to enhance viral assembly  <cit> . however, despite their homology, pmnv <dig> and pmnv <dig> have different lengths, relatively low identity and similarity , and the hydrophobic inm-sorting sequence was found only in pmnv <dig> and not in pmnv <dig>  acmnpv odv-e <dig> has also recently been shown to act as a chondroitin lyase  <cit> . interestingly, both pmnv <dig> and pmnv <dig> contain all five of the conserved catalytic residues that are found in acmnpv odv-e <dig>  suggesting that either or both of these proteins might function as a chondroitin lyase.

pmnv <dig> contains a single predicted bir  domain. this domain acts directly on the caspase family of protease enzymes to block apoptosis and thereby allow the virus more time to replicate. the iap  family of proteins contains 1 ~  <dig> bir domains in the n terminal and an optional ring domain in the c terminal. pmnv <dig>  which lacks a predicted ring domain and is shorter than most other iaps , shares an identity of less than 60% with other iaps.

the pmnv genome contains two orfs with some homology to polyhedrin, pmnv <dig> and pmnv <dig>  lc-ms analysis has shown that the polyhedrin protein purified from pmnv occlusion bodies is derived from pmnv <dig>  <cit> . meanwhile, although three nudivirus orfs  were previously reported to show some homology to acmnpv polyhedrin  <cit> , and our blastp search also found a fourth match in hz2v <dig>  there is no functional evidence that polyhedrin protein is actually expressed by any of these orfs. the evolutionary relationship between these low identity, possible polyhedrin nudivirus homologs and baculoviral polyhedrin still remains unclear, but we tentatively conclude that pmnv <dig> is unlikely to be a polyhedrin gene.

pmnv polyhedrin is discussed in more detail in the second half of this study.

pmnv putative orfs that are homologous to nudivirus, bracovirus and hytrosavirus genes
enzymes involved in dna replication
the pmnv genome contains four putative orfs, pmnv  <dig>  pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig>  and pmnv <dig> , that are homologous to genes involved in dna replication.

pmnv <dig>  in addition to being a homolog to four nudivirus orfs that are homologous to acmnpv polyhedrin, has a predicted 29% amino acid identity with hz1v <dig> and hz2v <dig> . a pfam database search revealed that the n-terminus of all three proteins matched the xpg  n-terminal domain with e-values of around  <dig>  . the presence of this domain in hz2v <dig> led burand et al.  <cit>  to propose that it is a dna excision and repair enzyme that restores damaged dna. homologs of this enzyme are found among the nudiviruses and in the musca domestica salivary gland hypertrophy virus , but not in the baculovirus genomes. the baculoviruses encode various other proteins for dna repair instead. for example, some of the nucleopolyhedroviruses use photolyase to repair uv-damaged dna  <cit> . pmnv <dig>  most closely matched the integrase of hznv- <dig>  , which phylogenetic analysis suggests was formed by duplication of the baculovirus and nudivirus conserved vlf- <dig> gene  <cit> . pmnv <dig> is predicted to belong to the phage integrase family . members of this family mediate unidirectional site-specific recombination between two dna recognition sequences  <cit> . tyrosine is the key catalytic site of this enzyme activity, and a catalytic tyrosine was found on one of the six possible active sites of pmnv <dig> predicted by pfam. integrase mediates the excision and integration of viral genetic material into the host genome. this process is essential for microplitis demolitor bracovirus   <cit> , and hznv- <dig> also has a similar mechanism that integrates viral dna into the host chromosome for persistent infection  <cit> . however, it is still unclear if this protein has any functional role in pmnv.

blastp found that pmnv <dig> and pmnv <dig> both matched the same danaus plexippus protein with an identity of 30%  and 28% , respectively . the same two orfs also matched hznv- <dig> putative helicase  <dig> with 27% identity . however, these two orfs have relatively low amino acid sequence identity and similarity , which means that if they really are homologs to helicase  <dig>  then the original gene duplication must have occurred a long time ago. the genomes of the other sequenced nudiviruses each contain only a single instance of a gene that is homologous to helicase  <dig> 

structural proteins
four putative orfs, pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig> , pmnv <dig>  and pmnv <dig> , were homologous to bracovirus proteins. proteomic analysis showed that these proteins were associated with the bracovirus particles  <cit> , suggesting that the pmnv proteins might also be structural proteins involved in viral packaging, assembly, or release.

proteins with other known and unknown functions
fourteen other pmnv orfs are homologous to nudivirus and bracovirus genes/orfs with miscellaneous or unknown functions.

pmnv <dig> most closely matched the hznv- <dig> p <dig> gene  , which is a late expression gene that putatively acts as a late regulator with unknown function  <cit> .

pmnv <dig> and pmnv <dig> have both been annotated previously as thymidine kinase   <cit> . however, we found that pmnv <dig> was homologous to hz2v <dig>  which has a guanosine monophosphate kinase  motif at position 57- <dig> aa and is annotated as a guanosine monophosphate kinase  <cit> . in hz1v <dig>  hz2v <dig> and pmnv <dig>  the conserved catalytic gmpk motif, g-x2-g-x-g-k has one mismatched amino acid at the second g position, but it is not known if this affects the putative functionality of these proteins. pmnv <dig> contains an aaa  domain , which implies that this protein belongs to the large, functionally diverse p-loop ntpase family. proteins in this family are involved in a range of biological processes, including dna replication, gene regulation, protein degradation, and signal transduction.

pmnv <dig> most closely matched hznv- <dig> esterase/lipase  . these proteins include the aes  signature , which suggests that pmnv <dig> might function as an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism.

most of the pmnv homologs were found in the genomes of hznv- <dig> and hznv- <dig>  and there was a higher similarity to genes from these two species than to the genes from other species. this is consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis, and provides further evidence that among the completely sequenced viruses, the heliothis zea and helicoverpa zea nudiviruses are the two species most closely related to pmnv.

occlusion bodies of pmnv
although the results of our phylogenetic analysis and search for orf homologs suggest a close relationship between pmnv and the non-occluded nudiviruses, figure  <dig> shows that a pmnv -infected nucleus contains enveloped virions that are embedded in approximately spherical occlusion bodies . the production of these obs is one of the main reasons why pmnv was previously assigned to the baculoviruses.figure  <dig>

hepatopancreatic cells.  occlusion bodies  and free virions  in the nucleus.  occluded virus  in the occlusion body which consists of a polyhedrin matrix.  free virions in the nucleus.  mature released obs in the tubule lumen of the hepatopancreas.



an ob is a highly ordered crystalline protein matrix produced by some insect viruses  and shrimp viruses  that enables the virus to survive in a hostile environment. obs protect the virions for long periods, and in baculoviruses they act as a per os delivery system by resisting solubilization until exposed to the host insect’s alkaline midgut  <cit> . the obs of pmnv consist of a polyhedrin protein that does not have any significant sequence similarity to any known proteins in genbank, but tblastn found a partial pvsnpv nucleotide sequence of unknown function that had 47% identity and an e-value 5 × 10- <dig>   <cit> . it has not yet been shown whether or not this sequence is involved in the formation of pvsnpv obs. however, both pmnv and pvsnpv have distinct, unenveloped spherical and tetrahedral obs, respectively, and these are quite different from the enveloped obs of the insect baculoviruses  <cit> .

recombinant pmnv polyhedrin spontaneously assembles into a protein complex
to study the molecular characteristics of pmnv polyhedrin, we expressed the pmnv polyhedrin gene  using an acmnpv baculovirus expression system. sf <dig> cells were then infected with recombinant acmnpv-polh   or wild-type acmnpv  and by  <dig> dpi, significant numbers of occlusion bodies had accumulated in the nuclei of both infected cell types . by contrast, cells infected with recombinant acmnpv-vp <dig>  were swollen and had a larger nucleus than the normal uninfected cells, but no occluded protein packages were seen inside the cells . this result indicates that pmnv polyhedrin can aggregate into a protein matrix naturally and form a stable structure in the cells. after 5- <dig> days of virus infection, most of the cells showed a serious cytopathic effect, and yielded large amounts of polyhedrin protein and acmnpv obs.after purification of the recombinant pmnv polyhedrin matrices and the acmnpv obs, the light-refractive polyhedral acmnpv obs were more easily visualized than the irregularly shaped and larger recombinant pmnv polyhedra . this result suggests that the assembly of pmnv polyhedrin might need other viral or host factors that are absent from the insect expression system to form pmnv wild type spherical obs.figure  <dig>

the effect of das buffer on the pmnv polyhedrin protein matrix and the acmnpv obs
dilute alkaline saline  buffer is commonly used for enhancing in vitro dissolution of baculoviral obs, and as expected, the polyhedrin from the acmnpv obs was found to be entirely dissolved in the supernatant fractions . however, the recombinant pmnv polyhedrin was not dissolved and was found in the pellet. we also note that the acmnpv polyhedrin bands show that both monomers and dimers were present in the partially denatured fraction.figure  <dig>

recombinant pmnv polyhedrin is solubilized by 2% sds, 8 m urea and acid
additional solubility analysis revealed that 2% sds and 8 m urea were able to dissolve recombinant pmnv polyhedrin by respectively breaking the protein’s hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding . acid treatment was also able to dissolve the pmnv polyhedrin. we further note that when the supernatant fraction was only partially denatured, the presence of the polyhedrin bands after 8 m urea and acid treatment shows that only these two treatments were able to induce complete dissolution of the pmnv polyhedrin matrix to the monomeric protein.figure  <dig>

by contrast, when the same treatments were applied to purified acmnpv obs, only 8 m urea was able to induce dissolution of the obs into polyhedrin monomers and an extremely faint band of dimers . although most of the acmnpv polyhedrin was solubilized in the presence of 8 m urea, the bands in lane  <dig> of the supernatant fractions were fainter than expected. we speculate that this was because the solubilized polyhedrin was digested by a protease that became active in the presence of urea. we also note that although the acmnpv obs were soluble in das , alkaline conditions alone  were not sufficient to dissolve the obs. this difference may be due to the presence of sodium, carbonate, and edta in the das buffer  <cit> .

wild-type pmnv obs
after purifying wild-type pmnv obs from the hepatopancreas of pmnv-infected postlarvae, we found that, unlike baculoviral obs, the pmnv obs were not spun down by  <dig>  × g centrifugation for 10 min . finally, however, we found that  <dig>  × g centrifugation for 30 min was sufficient to spin down most of the obs, although some obs still remained in the supernatant.

a further examination of the effects of different buffers on the pmnv obs found that only acidic conditions were able to induce pmnv polyhedrin to dissociate into monomers under partially denatured conditions . this result is consistent with the above analysis of the recombinant pmnv polyhedrin protein matrix, and also suggests a possible pmnv transmission mechanism whereby its obs are dissociated in the acidic environment of the host’s digestive tract. even though both insect and pmnv obs are transmitted per os, they show different characteristics that appear to be specifically adapted to the digestive environment of their respective hosts.we also found that wild-type pmnv obs were solubilized in 1/ <dig> pbs, te, 2% sds, 8 m urea and das buffer, but were stable in neutral and alkaline phosphate buffer  and in  <dig>  m nacl  .  a high molecular weight polyhedrin complex was observed in the supernatant under partially denatured conditions . the identity of the polyhedrin in these high molecular weight bands was confirmed by lc-ms/ms analysis . the results shown in figure 7a further suggest that ionic strength might affect the solubility of the pmnv obs, specifically that at higher ionic strengths, the pmnv obs are more likely to be present in the pellet fraction. to better understand this relationship, we examined the effect of different salt concentrations on the pmnv obs, and found that solubility increased from  <dig>  m nacl to 0 m nacl .figure  <dig>

in addition to showing the basic features of pmnv obs, these results suggest that instead of the more typical protective role of the acmnpv obs, pmnv might in fact use obs as part of its natural transmission strategy. one possible pathway of viral transmission is as follows: after the mature pmnv obs are released, the high ionic strength of the seawater environment helps to maintain the integrity of the pmnv obs and even allows physical association of large numbers of obs with shrimp feces or the bodies of dead shrimp. subsequently, when healthy shrimps ingest these pmnv obs, the obs become solubilized in the lower ionic strength conditions of the shrimp’s digestive tract, and then dissociate in the acid midgut. after the virions are released from the obs, they can then infect the midgut epithelium cells to complete the viral transmission.

CONCLUSIONS
nudiviruses were historically regarded as baculoviruses because both groups share similar characteristics, including rod-shaped, enveloped virions, a circular dsdna genome, and replication in the infected nucleus. eventually, in  <dig>  nudiviruses were removed from the family baculoviridae due to low genetic similarity  <cit> , but their taxonomic classification continues to be debated. while pmnv has characteristics that are shared both by the nudiviruses and the baculoviruses, it initially seemed more like a baculovirus than a nudivirus because of its obs. however, the results of the present study provide further evidence that this relatively unique virus does not comfortably belong to any of the present baculovirus genera. instead, we would argue that pmnv properly belongs within the newly proposed taxonomy of the nudiviridae family  <cit> . this is despite the fact that our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolutionary distance between pmnv and the nudiviruses is greater than the distances between any of the four genera  of the baculoviridae . we also recognize that the host range of pmnv is distinct from that of the other nudiviruses. nevertheless, when we followed jehle et al.
 <cit>  and used several taxonomically important genes to construct a phylogenetic tree, we found that, as in figure  <dig>  pmnv once again clearly forms a separate clade within the nudiviruses . we therefore propose that pmnv should be assigned to a third nudivirus genus, gammanudiviruses.figure  <dig>
