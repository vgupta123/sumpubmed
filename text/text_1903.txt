BACKGROUND
foliar bacterial phytopathogens such as the pseudomonas syringae species survive on the plant leaf surface as epiphytes  <cit> . during the initial infection process, the bacterial pathogens produce virulence factors including effector proteins and secondary metabolites, to inactivate early plant defense responses such as stomata-based immunity  <cit>  and hypersensitive response  cell death at the site of infection  <cit> . the failure of early pathogen recognition delays initiation of the downstream defense cascade and results in the development of disease symptoms in plants. therefore, the suppression of early plant defense responses is one of the important steps for bacterial pathogens to successfully colonize plant tissues, leading to disease.

it has long been thought that stomata are the passive portal for entry of phytopathogens. however, recent studies demonstrated that stomata play an active role in restricting bacterial invasion as part of the plant innate immune system  <cit> . perception of multiple bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns , including flagellin, lipopolysaccharide  and elongation factor tu  induces closure of stomata in leaf epidermal peels of arabidopsis <cit> . it is now believed that stomatal closure is a common plant defense response initiated by the perception of bacterial pamps and limits bacterial invasion in plants. however, certain bacterial pathogens have evolved to deliver specific virulence factors such as coronatine  to overcome pamp-triggered immunity  and stomata-based defense.

cor is a nonhost-specific, non-proteinaceous virulence effector produced by several pathovars of p. syringae <cit> . this is one of the most extensively studied phytobacterial secondary metabolites that modulate plant hormonal defense signaling and functions as a stomatal-based immunity suppressor. cor has structural and functional similarity to jasmonates including 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid  and jasmonic acid-isoleucine , and activates the ja pathway in arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . the virulent pathogen p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig>  produces cor on the plant surface to reopen closed stomata, allowing increased bacterial entry  <cit> . a pst dc <dig> mutant  that is deficient in cor production has severely attenuated virulence when dip- or spray-inoculated onto arabidopsis and tomato leaves  <cit> . however, this defect can be restored in arabidopsis mutants  that are defective in abscisic acid - and pamp-regulated stomatal closure  <cit> .

in contrast to the number of studies done for cor-producing bacterial pathogens, it has been largely overlooked that other pathovars of p. syringae without cor may also produce non-proteinaceous virulence factors to suppress plant innate immunity. xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris  that has a broad host range including brassicaceae family is shown to overcome stomatal defense in arabidopsis  <cit> . the extracellular metabolite secreted from xcc is regulated by rpf  gene cluster. the rpf mutant strains of xcc were unable to reopen stomata, but the stomata closure was reverted when ethyl acetate extracts from xcc culture supernatants were added to the mutant strains in arabidopsis  <cit> . two other p. syringae strains, p. s. pv. tabaci  and p. s. pv. tomato strain t <dig> , do not produce cor, but these bacterial strains can actively reopen stomata in tobacco and tomato plants, respectively  <cit> .

hypersensitive response  is another important form of early defense response against bacterial pathogens. hr is associated with defenses that are highly manifested by development of rapid cell death. a number of hr elicitors from bacterial pathogens have been described. phytobacterial avirulent proteins  cause hr during incompatible interactions in plants containing corresponding plant resistance  genes . protein products of the hrp  gene family cause hr in nonhost plants . the nonhost hr cell death is the common phenomenon observed in many plants in response to non-adapted bacterial pathogens  <cit> . the bacterial effector proteins of p. syringae are injected into plant cells by the pathogen type iii secretion system  to suppress basal resistance in host plants  <cit> . the ttss- and hrp-deficient mutants cannot elicit nonhost hr cell death or be pathogenic on host plants  <cit> . moreover, several effectors from pst dc <dig> play an important role in suppression of the r-gene mediated hr in tomato  <cit> . in addition, it has been also shown that the pst dc <dig> effector, avrpto, suppresses nonhost hr cell death in nicotiana benthamiana and tomato  <cit> . we recently showed that cor can also suppress hr induced by a nonhost pathogen in n. benthmaina <cit> .

in the current study, we report that the extracellular metabolite from pstab suppresses plant defense responses such as stomata-based immunity and hypersensitive response  cell death. we performed extracellular metabolite profiling of pstab by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  and isolated putative metabolites involved in the suppression of early plant defense responses in n. benthamiana. the patterns of plant defense gene expression suggest that the sa-mediated defense pathway may be modulated by extracellular metabolites from pstab.

RESULTS
bacterial pathogens, pstab and pst t <dig>  suppress early defense responses in their host plants, n. benthamiana and tomato, respectively
the early infection processes of pstab in n. benthamiana and pst t <dig> in tomato were determined using gfpuv-expressing bacteria  <cit> . five days after spray inoculation, a number of fluorescent spots  at infection sites were observed under long-wavelength uv light in n. benthamiana with pstab and in tomato with pst t <dig> infection. in contrast, only a few fluorescent spots were detected on n. benthamiana leaves infected with pst t <dig> and on tomato plants infected with pstab . we also observed that both pstab and pst t <dig> can reopen stomata and actively enter into apoplastic space in their respective host plants . however, most stomata remained closed in tomato when inoculated with a nonhost pathogen, pstab. similarly, most n. benthamiana stomata remained closed when inoculated with a nonhost pathogen, pst t <dig>  in addition, the inoculation of pst t <dig> induced typical nonhost hr cell death on n. benthamiana leaves within  <dig> hrs, while the host pathogen pstab did not induce any visible cell death at that time point . we speculate that the nonhost hr cell death in n. benthamiana is triggered either by pamps or effectors of the nonhost pathogen, pst t <dig>  such pamp- and/or effector-triggered hr is probably suppressed during pstab-n. benthamiana interaction, thus resulting in disease symptoms after inoculation. these results suggested that pstab produces host-specific virulence factor to inactivate stomatal closure and probably suppress pamp- and/or effector-triggered hr in n. benthamiana. this prompted us to investigate if any extracellular metabolite from pstab can inactivate some plant defense responses.

extracellular nonpolar metabolites from pstab suppress stomatal closure induced by the nonhost bacterial pathogen pst t1
we prepared the pstab extracts from bacterial culture to investigate whether the observed suppression of stomatal defense  is due to the metabolites secreted out of bacteria. the stomatal closure induced by the nonhost pathogen pst t <dig> was suppressed when pst t <dig> was mixed with the extracellular metabolites in the ethyl acetate extract of pstab culture supernatant prior to inoculation in n. benthamiana . to determine if the metabolites that suppress stomatal closure are extracellular or intracellular products, the pstab extracts were individually prepared from both the culture supernatant and bacterial cell pellets. detached n. benthamiana leaves were floated on a bacterial suspension of pst t <dig> mixed with extracts from either the minimal growth medium  or the pstab supernatant , or the pstab bacterial cell pellet . the pst t <dig> cell numbers in the leaf apoplast were significantly higher  at  <dig> hrs after incubation of pst t <dig> mixed with pstab supernatant when compared to bacterial numbers in the leaf treated with pst t <dig> mixed with pstab cell extract or the control . these findings suggest that pstab supernatant extracts function to suppress stomatal closure. we also detected a slight increase in bacterial entry with cell extract compared to mg extracts, possibly due to the presence of remaining small amounts of pstab extracellular extracts in bacterial cell pellet.

pstab extracts suppress hypersensitive response  cell death triggered by nonhost pathogens
nonhost disease resistance is the common plant defense mechanism which protects plants from various potential pathogens. hr is a common phenomenon for nonhost resistance observed in plant-bacterial pathogen interactions. we further tested whether the metabolites secreted from pstab  can also overcome nonhost hr cell death induced by pst t <dig> in n. benthamiana. hr occurred within  <dig> hrs of syringe infiltration of pst t <dig>  in n. benthamiana. interestingly, the nonhost hr cell death was suppressed when pst t <dig> was infiltrated along with pstab extracts. furthermore, when pstab extracts alone were infiltrated, there was no visible symptom on the n. benthamiana leaf .

to determine if pstab extracts play a role in virulence, we examined the growth of two nonhost bacterial pathogens, pst t <dig> and p. syringae pv. glycinea , in the n. benthamiana leaves in the presence of pstab extracts. after co-inoculation of pst t <dig> or psgly with pstab extracts, the bacterial growth was significantly higher on the inoculated area of both pst t <dig> + pstab extracts and psgly + pstab extracts than in the co-inoculated area of pst t <dig> or psgly with mg medium extracts  . since n. benthamiana is a nonhost for both psgly and pst t <dig>  their populations gradually decreased two days after inoculation in the mock control. the bacterial populations of psgly and pst t <dig> with pstab extracts also decreased, but the populations were higher than the population after the mock inoculation. no visible disease symptoms were found in either psgly + pstab extracts or pst t <dig> + pstab extracts in the inoculated area of the leaves when compared to mock controls.

to examine the stability of the metabolite, pstab extracts were treated at 95°c for  <dig> min and infiltrated with three nonhost bacterial pathogens, p. s. pv. phaseolicola, p. s. pv. maculicola and pst t <dig>  the degree of nonhost hr cell death suppression by the boiled pstab extracts did not change for all the tested nonhost pathogens . however, there was cell death at the site of syringe infiltration and chlorosis symptom with the boiled pstab extracts, suggesting that the virulence factor in the pstab extracts may be perturbed. to investigate whether pstab supernatant extracts can suppress r-gene- and pamp-mediated cell death, we transiently expressed r-avr gene combinations, pto/avrpto <cit>  and cf-9/avrcf- <dig> <cit> , in n. benthamiana leaves along with pstab extracts. in addition, we also expressed inf <dig>   <cit>  that encodes a pamp and causes cell death on n. benthamiana along with pstab extracts. the development of cell death  was monitored from  <dig> hrs after the inoculations. interestingly, pstab extracts did not suppress or reduce the intensity of cell death observed for both r-avr-gene- and pamp-induced hr . in addition, chemically induced cell death  was also not affected by pstab extracts, suggesting that pstab extracts specifically suppress nonhost hr cell death .

metabolite profiling of the extracellular metabolites from pstab
to further prove that pstab can secrete metabolites into the growth media, we performed metabolite profiling of the pstab culture media using uhplc-qtof-ms . the extracts of the pstab culture media contained secreted metabolites from pstab as well as mg medium. a total of  <dig> extracellular metabolites from pstab were detected after subtracting metabolites present in mg medium . the extracellular metabolite profiling includes the retention time, specific ion  and relative intensity used to differentiate unique metabolites; however, they were not chemically annotated . in particular, m <dig> with the most abundant ion  <dig>   was quantitatively the major metabolite in the extracellular metabolites of pstab.

altered expression of defense-related genes by pstab extracts
sa has been shown to play a role in hr cell death. we determined the gene expression of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> to dissect the involvement of pstab extracts in the sa-mediated defense pathway. the expression of the pr <dig> gene was slightly induced in n. benthamiana leaves at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs after treatments of mg extracts and pstab extracts. we didn’t examine for the expression of pr <dig> and pr <dig> after treatments of mg extracts and pstab extracts. the elevation of the pr <dig> expression without pst t <dig> inoculation may be related to wounding stress by syringe infiltration. however, when treated with pst t <dig>  the expression level of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> was significantly induced. strikingly, the accumulation of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> gene transcripts was significantly reduced in n. benthamiana leaves when the pstab extracts were mixed with pst t <dig> . we examined the expression level of hsr203j, the marker gene for cell death  <cit> , after pst t <dig> inoculation. the expression level of hsr203j was not different among samples treated with mg extracts or pstab extracts without pst t <dig> . however, the expression level of hsr203j was significantly increased after pst t <dig> inoculation but the induction of hsr203j was much lower at  <dig> hpi when pst t <dig> was inoculated with pstab extracts, suggesting that pstab extracts delay the signaling for nonhost pathogen induced-hr cell death . although, we didn’t observe any visible cell death at the site of infiltration of pst t1/pstab extracts, the level of hsr203j expression in pst t1/pstab extracts was similar with pst t1/mg extracts at  <dig> hpi. these results suggest that pstab extracts down-regulate sa-mediated early defense to suppress nonhost hr cell death. to determine if ja signaling is altered by pstab extracts, the expression of plant defensin , a marker for the ja signaling pathway, was examined. the expression level of pdf <dig>  was increased rapidly by  <dig> hrs in leaves infiltrated by mg extracts due to wound stress by syringe infiltration, while the expression level with pstab extracts alone remained little changed during the experiment , suggesting that the pstab extracts suppress even the wound induced defense response. when pst t <dig> was inoculated with mg extracts and pstab extracts, the transcripts of pdf <dig>  were increased at  <dig> hpi and declined at  <dig> hpi . the expression pattern was not significantly different between pst t <dig> + mg extracts and pst t <dig> + pstab extracts, suggesting that the ja-mediated defense signaling pathway against bacterial pathogen may not be directly modulated by pstab extracts, in contrast to the sa-mediated pathway.

it has been known that coronatine insensitive  <dig>  gene is involved in the stomatal defense in response to bacterial pathogens  <cit> . thus, we examined the gene expressions of coi <dig> to determine if pstab extracts target the expression of this gene. the level of expression of coi <dig> gradually decreased upon infiltration of mg extracts and pstab extracts alone . this finding agrees with the results of arabidopsis gene expressions data in the efp browser  that the gene expressions are down-regulated  <dig> and  <dig> hrs after distilled water infiltration in arabidopsis. after nonhost pathogen pst t <dig> inoculation, coi <dig> gene was significantly down-regulated by pstab extracts at  <dig> hrs post inoculation. however, coi <dig> expression pattern with pst t <dig> inoculation appeared similar to that of the coi <dig> expression pattern upon infiltration of mg extracts and pstab extracts alone . this finding indicates that coi <dig> expression is decreased at  <dig> hpi by pstab extracts and may interfere with the coi1-mediated defense pathway.

abscisic acid  is the critical phytohormone for regulating stomatal opening and closure. aba <dig> is induced by aba and a marker gene for the aba signaling pathway. the expression of aba <dig> was similar to that of coi <dig> where in the expression was down-regulated upon infiltration with mg extracts and pstab extracts alone . in arabidopsis, aba <dig> expression is reduced  <dig> hrs after water or buffer infiltration . pst t <dig> infection did not alter the expression of aba <dig> compared to infiltration with mg extracts and pstab extracts alone . in addition, the expression pattern of aba <dig> was not significantly different among pst t <dig> + mg extracts inoculated leaves and pst t <dig> + pstab extracts inoculated leaves.

discussion
studies on the mechanisms of bacterial elicitation of early plant defense responses have unraveled important questions during plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . it is remarkable that bacteria have evolved to deliver diverse virulence factors to defeat sophisticated plant defense systems  <cit> . apart from the numerous proteinaceous effectors that the bacteria can deliver into plants, cor is the first discovered virulence metabolite secreted from several p. syringae strains and can suppress plant defense responses  <cit> . however, we still don’t know whether other non-cor-producing pathovars of p. syringae produce metabolites that have virulence function. it is still not clear how extracellular metabolites from bacterial pathogens can suppress plant defense responses.

in this study, we showed that extracellular metabolites from the non-cor producing pseudomonas syringae pathogen, pstab, can suppress plant defense responses including stomatal closure and nonhost hr cell death in n. benthamiana. most stomata in epidermal peels of n. benthamiana close within  <dig> hrs upon inoculation with the nonhost pathogen pst t <dig>  both pst t <dig> and pstab do not produce cor , but they can still reopen stomata in their respective host plants . we demonstrated that pstab extracts suppress stomatal defense in n. benthamiana; however, it is unknown how pst t <dig> suppresses stomatal defense in tomato. cor has been shown to suppress stomatal closure in arabidopsis  <cit> , and this is important for a virulent bacterium to enter the leaf apoplast. interestingly, when a nonhost pathogen, pst t <dig>  was inoculated on n. benthamiana with pstab extracts, the stomatal closure induced by pst t <dig> was suppressed . this finding suggests that the non-cor-producing strain pstab may produce other uncharacterized extracellular metabolites that may have a similar function as cor in opening stomata.

we also found that the nonhost hr cell death induced by pst t <dig> in n. benthamiana was also suppressed when inoculated with pstab extracts . it has been known that pstab produces tabtoxin that induces chlorosis and is associated with the symptoms of wildfire disease on tobacco and halo blight of oats  <cit> . tabtoxin is a dipeptide which is not biologically active and needs to be hydrolyzed by peptidase for an active toxic component, tabtoxinine-β-lactam . tβl is released by zinc-dependent aminopeptidases in the periplasm of the bacterium or by enzymes in the plant cell, and inhibits the enzyme glutamine synthetase that results in chlorosis  <cit> . raaijmakers et al.  <cit>  described that tβl is proved to be difficult to synthesize due to the toxin’s instability. tabtoxin is a relatively unstable molecule in vivo and during the procedures of toxin purification  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the biological activity of a tabtoxin solution decreases with a half-life of approximately one day at room temperature  <cit> . in addition, chlorosis is the most characteristic symptom of tabtoxin in tobacco leaves  <cit> . we, therefore, hypothesized that pstab extracts does not contain tabtoxin. to prove that metabolites but not active proteins play a role in stomata opening and hr suppression, the pstab culture supernatant was extracted using an organic solvent, ethyl acetate with 1% formic acid. the process of ethyl acetate extraction removes peptides from pstab. we also examined whether the pstab extracts have any toxic activity in n. benthamiana leaves. the inoculated leaves did not produce any visible symptoms contrary to tabtoxin that produces yellowing   <cit> .

p. syringae pathovars produce several non-effector type virulence factors such as tabtoxin, phaseolotoxin, mangotoxin, and cor  <cit> . all these phytotoxins except cor are made of small peptide molecules. cor is a non-proteinaceous phytotoxin that is involved in stomata opening and suppressing sa-dependent host defense responses  <cit> . cor was isolated from p. syringae pv. tomato using hplc fractionation  <cit> . however, we used a metabolomics approach to isolate bioactive metabolite from pstab extracts using uhplc-qtof-ms for metabolite profiling. the metabolite profiling determined the total number of metabolites secreted from pstab in the bacterial culture. this metabolite profiling technique has been effectively used to isolate metabolites differentially expressed in different bacterial strains  <cit> . since there were not a large number of metabolites , we can further examine bioactive metabolite which can suppress stomatal closure and nonhost hr cell death using hplc fractionation. the identification of the pstab extracellular metabolite that suppresses early plant defense responses in the future will advance our understanding of bacterial pathogen-plant infections.

salicylic acid  is an important plant hormone for regulating defense responses like stomatal closure and hr  <cit> . the bacterial growth of both nonhost pathogens, psgly and pst t <dig>  was significantly higher in n. benthamiana when they were co-inoculated with pstab extracts . this could be due to suppression of sa-mediated early defense signaling  by pstab extracts or due to the suppression of hr. the level of nonhost bacterial population gradually decreased three days after inoculation, and no disease symptoms appeared on the inoculated leaves  suggesting that pstab extracts suppress only early defense responses but do not function as pathogenicity factors.

we determined whether pstab extracts also modulate the jasmonic acid -mediated defense pathway by examining the level of pdf <dig>  and coi <dig> gene expression. the bacterial virulence factor cor stimulates the ja pathway, thereby suppressing the sa pathway in arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . it has been shown that cor targets coi <dig> /jai <dig> -dependent pathways to promote suppression of stomatal-based immunity  <cit> . jaz proteins are repressors of ja signaling, and few jaz proteins  have been shown to interact with coi <dig> <cit> . it has also been shown that coi <dig> plays a role in plant cell death during plant-microbe interaction. when coi <dig> was silenced in n. benthamiana, cell death-induced by potato virus x  was accelerated  <cit> . devadas et al.  <cit>  reported that a hrl <dig>  coi <dig> double mutant exacerbated cell death lesions, suggesting that coi <dig> is necessary for cell death limitation.

interestingly, in our study, we observed that nonhost hr cell death was suppressed by pstab extracts, but not for any of the specific r-avr or pamp triggered cell death. it is possible that the unknown metabolite in pstab extracts may specifically inhibits the defense mechanism involved in nonhost resistance. further studies should be performed to isolate the metabolite and identity its function for the suppression of nonhost hr cell death in response to bacterial pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
it is demonstrated here that another pseudomonas pathogen, pstab that does not produce cor, can still actively suppress stomatal defense and nonhost hr cell death in n. benthamiana. this finding clearly suggests that pseudomonas syringae strains can produce metabolite other than cor to suppress plant defense responses. isolation and characterization of the pstab extracellular metabolite will facilitate a better understanding of strategies used by bacterial pathogens to cause disease in host plants.
