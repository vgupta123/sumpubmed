BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic organisms, post-translational protein modification by methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, or ubiquitination by ub  and ubls , play important roles in diverse cellular regulatory processes  <cit> . similar to ubiquitination, ubl modifications, such as sumoylation, are known to facilitate reversible conjugation of a sumo  polypeptide to protein substrates by the formation of an isopeptide bond between the c-terminal glycine carboxyl group of sumo and the ε-amino group of the lysine residue in the conserved sumoylation sites of substrate proteins with the consensus motif  . sumoylation through the sumo conjugation pathway involves the sequential action of a series of enzymes: e <dig> sumo activation enzyme, e <dig> sumo conjugation enzyme and e <dig> sumo ligase . subsequently, sumo proteases can deconjugate sumo from its associated substrate . ubiquitination results in the targeting of the protein substrate for proteasomal degradation  <cit> , whereas sumoylation is a transient and reversible process that often results in an altered function and/or cellular localization of the modified protein  <cit> .

a number of studies have shown that sumoylation is involved in a broad range of biological processes. for example, in animals and yeast, sumo modifications affect cell cycle progression, dna replication and repair, protein activity and stability, chromatin structural maintenance, subcellular localization and transcriptional regulation, as well as oxidative stress responses . sumoylation in plants has been associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses, flowering and other aspects of development . moreover, protein sumoylation by the arabidopsis thaliana sumo e <dig> ligase siz <dig>  has been shown to be involved in many environmental responses, including those related to phosphate deficiency, nitrogen assimilation, cell growth and development, tolerance of drought, cold, and high levels of copper, basal thermotolerance independent of the hormone salicylic , sa-dependent signaling associated with both defense and development, flowering time regulation, and both auxin and abscisic acid  signaling . thus, plant post-translational modification by sumoylation is of fundamental importance in modulating numerous signaling pathways.

sumo e <dig> ligases participate in the sumoylation pathways that are crucial to many eukaryotic biological processes. several types of sumo e <dig> ligases have been identified, including ranbp <dig> , pc <dig> , nes2/mms <dig>  and siz/pias  . of these, siz/pias family proteins, which are characterized by an essential sp-ring domain, represent the largest group of sumo e <dig> ligases, all of which share high degree of sequence identity. siz/pias e <dig> ligases have five structural motifs: an n-terminal sap  motif, a pinit  motif, a sp-ring zinc finger domain, a sxs  domain and a phd motif  . there are two pias-type sumo e <dig> ligases that have been identified in arabidopsis are siz <dig>  <cit>  and mms21/hpy <dig>  .

most studies to date of plant e <dig> ligases have focused on those of the experimental model a. thaliana and comparatively little is known about these proteins in agronomically- and horticulturally-important species. in this report, we describe the characterization of dnsiz <dig>  <cit> , a functional sumo e <dig> ligase from the monocot dendrobium, the largest genus of the orchidaceae, which contains species that are mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions. the orchidaceae are one of the largest families of flowering plants and many members of this family have high ornamental and commercial value. here we report the activity and subcellular localization of dnsiz <dig>  together with an assessment of its expression patterns and function in planta through overexpression in transgenic arabidopsis lines. our results suggest that dnsiz <dig> is a functional homolog of the arabidopsis siz <dig> and may play an important role in the regulation of dendrobium stress responses, flowering and development.

RESULTS
molecular characterization of dnsiz1
in arabidopsis, the pias-type sumo e <dig> ligase atsiz <dig> regulates responses to hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses, and controls flowering  <cit> . we previously reported the isolation of dnsiz <dig>  the dendrobium homolog of atsiz <dig>  <cit> . the dnsiz <dig> gene encodes protein of  <dig> amino acids and its nucleotide sequence was deposited in genbank . to investigate the biological roles of dnsiz <dig>  we first identified and aligned the sequences of siz/pias family proteins from the ncbi protein database. the results indicated that the dnsiz <dig> deduced protein has three predicted domains , which are conserved in atsiz <dig>  <cit>  . in addition, a pro-ile-asn-ile-thr  core motif was identified that is more similar to the equivalent sequence in rice   <cit> . but the sxp domain is different from sxs domain in arabidopsis and rice. in plant siz/pias-type proteins there are five conserved domain structures: sap, phd, pinit, sp-ring and sxs  <cit> . the sap domain, which is specially required for trans-repression activity of pias, can form a helix-extended loop-helix structure that binds to dna  <cit> . the phd domain, which is only present in plant siz/pias homologs, is a c4hc <dig> zn-finger  <cit> , while the pinit and sp-ring domains are essential for the sumo e3-ligase activity of siz/pias proteins  <cit> . based on the protein sequence alignment and the phylogenetic relationships among dnsiz <dig> and homologous proteins from other species , dnsiz <dig> shares high sequence identity with siz/pias proteins of other species in regard to conserved structures that are essential for sumo e <dig> ligase activity and are especially similar to siz <dig> proteins in rice and sorghum.fig.  <dig> amino acid sequence alignment of the siz/pias proteins. the deduced amino acid sequence of dnsiz <dig> was aligned with the amino acid sequences of siz/pias homologs from other species. the sequences were obtained from the ncbi protein database using the blast network service. amino acid sequences of siz/pias proteins from dendrobium , arabidopsis thaliana , oryza sativa , medicago truncatula , glycine max , vitis vinifera , brachypodium distachyon , homo sapiens , mus musculus , saccharomyces cerevisiae  and schizosaccharomyces pombe . the domains include: the sap ; the phd ; the pinit ; the sp-ring ; and the sxs  domain. black and gray shaded backgrounds indicated amino acids that were identical residues or conservative substitutions, respectively. hyphens indicated gaps introduced to optimize alignments. numbers above the alignment indicated the number of the amino acids from the first amino acid

expression patterns of dnsiz1
to gain insights into the potential functions of dnsiz <dig>  we analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of its transcript accumulation using semi-quantitative rt-pcr. as shown in fig.  <dig>  transcripts of dnsiz <dig> were detected in all organs, including roots, stems, leaves, flowers and flower buds, with the higher expression level being detected in old leaves, young leaves and young stems, and lower expression in roots and flowers. next, we analyzed whether the expression of dnsiz <dig> gene could be induced in response to abiotic and hormonal stress. the results showed dnsiz <dig> expression was reduced first and strongly up-regulated later when treated with high temperature , cold  and wounding .fig.  <dig> the expression patterns of dnsiz <dig> gene. rt-pcr analysis of dnsiz <dig> transcripts in different organs of dendrobium. 18srna served as an internal control. ol, old leaves; yl, young leaves; ost, old stem; yst, young stem; r, root; fb, flower bud; f, flower

subcellular localization of dnsiz1
previous studies showed that arabidopsis siz <dig> is localized to the nucleus and accumulates in nuclear speckles  <cit> . to determine the subcellular localization of the dnsiz <dig> protein, we expressed the gfp fusion constructs in wild-type  arabidopsis roots, the line 35s::dnsiz1:gfp # <dig> was used . the fluorescent signal was monitored by confocal microscopy and it was determined that the fusion protein accumulated in the nucleus .fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of dnsiz <dig> protein. a schematic representation of constructs for constitutive expression in arabidopsis root cells. camv35s, cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter; egfp, green fluorescent protein; t

phenotypic analysis of dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants
to further understand the function of dnsiz <dig>  it was overexpressed in the arabidopsis siz1- <dig> mutant. the siz1- <dig> phenotypes of dwarfism with leaf curl and short leaf length were partially functionally rescued in plants from two separate transgenic lines  . for example, the length of the largest leaves of the dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants was  <dig> – 54 % greater than the equivalent leaves of the untransformed mutant. in addition to the stunted phenotype, siz1- <dig> plants are hypersensitive to exogenous aba  <cit> . to test whether dnsiz <dig> overexpression can functionally complement the aba hypersensitive phenotype of siz1- <dig>  we investigated the aba responses of the different genotypes. we also observed that the seed germination rates of the dnsiz <dig> transgenic lines were strongly enhanced relative to those of siz1- <dig>  although slightly lower than those of wild-type plants at 48 h after stratification . furthermore, analysis of cotyledon greening showed that the dnsiz <dig> transgenic lines were less sensitive to aba than siz1- <dig> when grown on media containing  <dig>  μm aba, although they were more sensitive than wild-type plants . taken together, these results indicate that dnsiz <dig> can partially complement at least some of the functions of atsiz <dig> in development and aba signaling pathways.fig.  <dig> phenotypic analysis of dnsiz <dig> overexpressing plants and their corresponding expression levels. a leaf phenotypes of plants expressing dnsiz <dig>  the leaves were taken and arranged in each row from the left. plants expressing dnsiz <dig> in the siz1- <dig>  mutant were compared with col- <dig> and siz1- <dig>  b expression of siz1- <dig>  plants expressing dnsiz <dig>  total rna was extracted from three-week-old plants and rt-pcr was performed using gene-specific primers . actin was used as an internal control. c the results of statistical analysis of leaf length for each of the lines are shown in . the largest leaves of each line were used for leaf length measurement. the data are the means of three different experiments and indicate the percentage  of leaf length in each transgenic plant line. significant differences from siz1- <dig>  at p <  <dig>  are indicated. bar = 2 cm

dnsiz <dig> negatively regulates flowering time
flowering marks the transition from vegetative maturity to the reproductive stage of development  <cit> , and the floral transition is mainly regulated by photoperiod, vernalization, the autonomous pathway and gibberellin -dependent signaling  <cit> . the time needed for the transition from vegetative development to reproductive growth of wild-type, siz1- <dig> and dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants were recorded by counting the numbers of rosette leaves at the time of flowering  <cit> . under normal growth conditions, rosette leaf numbers at flowering in the dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants relative to siz1- <dig> were slightly higher, but were lower than those of wild-type and atsiz <dig> transgenic plants . however, following a vernalization treatment at 4 °c for three weeks, rosette leaf numbers at flowering of all genotypes decreased. but, rosette leaf numbers at flowering of dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants are significantly more than those of siz1- <dig> mutant . thus, the early flowering phenotype of siz1- <dig> was suppressed by overexpressing dnsiz <dig> gene following vernalization, indicating that dnsiz <dig> may repress flowering through vernalization-induced transition to flowering.fig.  <dig> comparison of the flowering time of wild-type, siz1- <dig>  35s::dnsiz <dig> and 35s::atsiz <dig> transgenic plants. a seeds of the four genotypes were stratified for 2- <dig> d and then grown in the greenhouse under long-day conditions. b seeds of the four genotypes were stratified for 3 weeks and then grown in the greenhouse under long day conditions. the flowering time was estimated based on the number of rosette leaves as described above  <cit> . the data are averages of three independent experiments. values presented are the percentages of rosette leaf numbers in transgenic plant line . significant differences from atsiz1- <dig>  at p <  <dig>  are indicated



heat shock-induced accumulation of sumo conjugates in dnsiz <dig> transgenic lines
previous studies have shown that heat shock can induce sumoylation  <cit> , sumoylation in wild-type arabidopsis and ossiz1/ossiz <dig> heterogenous transgenic lines are stronger than those in arabidopsis siz1- <dig> plants  <cit> . in our study, the dnsiz <dig> protein also participated in response to heat shock-induced accumulation of sumo conjugates. under normal conditions, sumo conjugates in wild-type, siz1- <dig> and dnsiz <dig> overexpressing transgenic arabidopsis plants accumulated at relatively low levels. however, when exposed to a 42 °c heat shock for 30 min, transgenic lines produced significantly greater amounts of sumo conjugates than arabidopsis siz1- <dig> plants , suggesting that dnsiz <dig> can functionally complement arabidopsis siz1- <dig> in the sumo conjugation pathway. collectively, these results suggested that the dnsiz <dig> protein exhibits sumo e <dig> ligase activity that can contribute to the sumo modification pathway.fig.  <dig> heat shock-induced accumulation of sumo conjugates in transgenic lines. total proteins were extracted from untreated  or heat-shocked   <dig> d-old seedlings of the wild type , siz1- <dig> , and each of transgenic lines . 20 μg of proteins was on an sds-page gel and the immunoblot was probed with an anti-sumo <dig> antibody



dnsiz <dig> is a functional sumo e <dig> ligase
in order to further demonstrate the ability of dnsiz <dig> to act as a sumo e <dig> ligase, we generated pcdfduet-1-flag-dnsiz <dig> and pcdfduet-1-flag-dnsiz1c380a constructs, in which the c380a mutation was introduced in its sp-ring, that is conserved in siz1s in different species and essential for sumo ligase activity  <cit> . then we performed sumoylation assays in e.coli strain expressing dnsiz <dig> together with atsae1a-sae <dig>  atsce1a and atsumo <dig>  <cit> . compared with negative control, in the presence of atsae1a-sae <dig>  atsce1a and atsumo <dig>  sumoylation of dnsiz <dig> was detected, indicating that dnsiz <dig> can be sumoylated by e <dig> sumo conjugation enzyme, which is a characteristic feature of sumo e <dig> ligase . in addition, the sumoylated band of dnsiz1c380a is weaker than that of dnsiz <dig>  which suggested the sp-ring is important for sumoylation of dnsiz <dig>  providing envidence to support it is a potential sumo e <dig> ligase . coomassie brilliant blue staining of total protein was used as the loading control shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> 
in vitro assays indicate that dnsiz <dig> is a functional sumo e <dig> ligase. a pcdfduet-1-flag-dnsiz <dig> was expressed in escherichia coli and then tested for sumoylation activity in the presence of e <dig> , e <dig>  and myc-sumo <dig>  b pcdfduet-1-flag-dnsiz <dig> and pcdfduet-1-flag-dnsiz1c380a were expressed in escherichia coli and then tested for sumoylation activity. immunoblots generated from these samples were probed with anti-flag antibodies



discussion
sumoylation is a post-translational regulatory process in eukaryotes. in plants, sumoylation has mostly been studied in arabidopsis, where it is involved in aba responses, flowering time, phosphate starvation responses, salicylic acid -dependent defense responses, cold tolerance, drought, basal thermotolerance and removal of heavy metal . in the context of siz gene functions, among the monocotyledons only siz <dig> and siz <dig> from rice have been described and it has been suggested that they functionally complement arabidopsis atsiz <dig> in the sumo conjugation pathway  <cit> . to date little is known about the biological significance and sumoylation mechanism in the ornamental monocotyledon dendrobium. in this current study, a dendrobium siz gene, dnsiz <dig>  was identified based on homology to siz genes from rice, sorghum and arabidopsis  <cit> . the sap, sp-ring and phd domains of dnsiz <dig> have a high degree of sequence conservation with those of atsiz <dig>  while the pinit domain is most similar to that of the ossiz <dig>  however, in the sxs domain, the amino acid sequence is sxp instead of sxs, which we propose represents a species specific change . given that dnsiz <dig> has high degree of sequence identity with siz <dig> proteins from rice and sorghum  and has the canonical sp-ring domain that is necessary for the sumo e <dig> ligase activity of siz/pias proteins  <cit> , we speculate that dnsiz <dig> encodes an sp-ring protein with sumo e <dig> ligase activity.

the expression pattern of dnsiz <dig> gene was shown in fig.  <dig>  dnsiz <dig> transcripts were detected in all tissues tested, and the expression was higher in leaves and young stems than other tissues. evaluation of the expression in response to various environmental and hormonal stimuli  showed that dnsiz <dig> expression had an up-regulation trend in response to high temperature , cold  and wounding. not only significant transcripts were induced in response to high temperature, but also sumo conjugates increased obviously in dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants after heat treatment . thus, it is likely that the activity of dnsiz <dig> might be controlled at the transcriptional level and post-translational level in response to heat stress  <cit> . we also noted that the accumulation of sumo conjugates in siz1- <dig> remained inducible by heat treatment, but the increase of sumo conjugates in dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants was highly dependent on dnsiz <dig> activity, since the accumulation of sumo conjugates was significantly lower in siz1- <dig> compared with dnsiz <dig> transgenic plants . many reports showed that sumoylation pathway member e <dig> ligase is dramatically affected by heat stress  <cit> . moreover, some sumo e <dig> ligases such as atsiz <dig>  ossiz1/ossiz <dig> and hpy <dig> can also improve thermotolerance in plants  <cit> . our results imply that dnsiz <dig> plays a general role in heat stress response and may enhance heat tolerance in plants.

although we have established that key domains of dnsiz <dig> are conserved in the atsiz <dig> protein, we wanted to further confirm that dnsiz <dig> can function as a sumo e <dig> ligase. accordingly, we constructed a sumoylation reactions system in e.coli  <cit>  and demonstrated that dnsiz <dig> is a functional sumo e <dig> ligase . in addition, we observed the subcellular location of dnsiz <dig> and the fluorescent signal in roots derived from the transgenic plants showed that dnsiz <dig> protein accumulated in the nucleus , which is further evidence for dnsiz <dig> function as a sumo e <dig> ligase in dendrobium. it is significant because many transcription factors can be targeted by sumo conjugation mediated by siz/pias proteins  <cit> . for example, the transcription factors phr <dig>  ice <dig>  abi <dig>  myb <dig> and flc have been identified as targets of siz <dig> in arabidopsis. these transcription factors are involved in phosphate starvation responses, cold tolerance, aba responses and flowering time . taken together, our results indicate that the dnsiz <dig> protein is localized in the nucleus, may regulate transcription factors in response to a variety of environmental stresses through siz1-dependent sumo conjugation.

the orchidaceae is the largest family in the plant kingdom and dendrobium is a sizeable genus consisting of more than a thousand species that are native to south asia, australia, new zealand, and oceania, many of which show evidence of adaptation to stresses imposed by their environments, such as nutrient starvation, heat, cold, drought and wounding  <cit> . while dendrobium spp. are valued as ornamental plants worldwide, traditional breeding methods of sexual hybridization and selection are too time-consuming to meet the increasing global demand. one major obstacle for dendrobium breeding is the prolonged vegetative phase before dendrobium switches to reproductive development  <cit> . thus, the study of flowering transition and elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms in dendrobium is of great potential commercial value. broadly speaking, five genetically defined pathways have been identified that control flowering: the vernalization pathway, the photoperiod pathway, the gibberellin-mediated pathway, the autonomous pathway and the endogenous pathway  <cit> . previous studies have shown that atsiz <dig> acts as a negative regulator of the transition to flowering through mechanisms that reduce sa accumulation and involve sumo modification of flowering locus d  and flowering locus c  <cit> . in this current study, we found that dnsiz <dig> may repress flowering through vernalization-induced floral transition . vernalization-induced flowering is an adaptation to cold conditions in many species, but most of what is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization has resulted from studies of a. thaliana  <cit> . in dendrobium, flowering time is induced by low temperatures  <cit> . moreover, dnsiz <dig> expression strongly responded to cold  . it implies the negative regulation of the flowering transition by dnsiz <dig> may operate through the vernalization pathway, but the exact molecular mechanisms are still unclear because no orthologs of arabidopsis flc have been found in dendrobium so far. we note that this characteristic of dnsiz <dig> may have practical applications for enhancing the economic value of this ornamental crop.

the arabidopsis siz <dig> mutant shows a dwarf phenotype with leaf curling and short leaves  <cit>  and we used these characteristics to assess functional conservation of dnsiz <dig>  to this end we overexpressed dnsiz <dig> under the control of the camv35s promoter in the siz1- <dig> mutant and observed that the mutant phenotypes were indeed partially functionally complemented . moreover, dnsiz <dig> overexpression partially rescued the aba hypersensitivity of siz1- <dig> in seed germination stage . these results show dnsiz <dig> may play an important role in plant development. taken together, the biological functions of dnsiz <dig> are multiple and complex, similar to arabidopsis siz <dig>  in order to further explore the biological functions of dnsiz <dig>  we are now establishing a dendrobium transformation system to suppress dnsiz <dig> expression using rnai technology. in addition, the exact molecular mechanisms by which dnsiz <dig> controls flowering time as well as the regulatory network of sumoylation will be the target of future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized the biological functions of dnsiz <dig>  a functional siz/pias-type sumo e <dig> ligase in dendrobium, and the results indicated substantial evolutionary conservation with, and a similar biological function to arabidopsis atsiz <dig>  the dnsiz <dig> protein localizes to the nucleus and has sumo e <dig> ligase activity when assayed in e.coli recombinant system and modulated by heat stress condition. moreover, dnsiz <dig> overexpression can partially complement several arabidopsis siz1- <dig> mutant phenotypes. the expression of dnsiz <dig> gene is detectable in all organs and can be induced by various stress conditions. overall, dnsiz <dig> is a functional sumo e <dig> ligase and play an important role in the regulation of dendrobium stress responses, flowering and development.
