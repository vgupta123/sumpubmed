BACKGROUND
mycoplasmas are the smallest known self-replicating prokaryotes originally isolated from bovine pleuropneumonia and are also referred as pleuropneumonia like organisms . a key characteristic of mycoplasma is the lack of a cell wall, which allows exchange of different components between the host membrane and the m. pneumoniae membrane after adhesion  <cit> . m. pneumoniae is a human pathogen that colonizes the ciliated upper and lower respiratory tract, causing atypical pneumonia. m. pneumoniae is also found to be associated with other respiratory tract infections such as tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, acute respiratory distress syndrome , guillain-barre syndrome , stroke and less severe upper respiratory tract infections in older children as well as in young adults  <cit> . adherence of m. pneumoniae to the human host respiratory epithelium is a prerequisite for the colonization and subsequent induction of disease  <cit> . it attaches to ciliated epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, where it induces ciliostasis that protects the m. pneumoniae from removal by the mucociliary clearance mechanism of the host  <cit> . m. pneumoniae is elongated and consists of a longer tail-like rear end, a thicker body part and a frontal attachment organelle.

cytadherence requires a complex interaction of several m. pneumoniae proteins present on the attachment organelle, including the adhesins p <dig> , p <dig> , and p <dig>  and proteins hmw <dig> to hmw <dig>  as well as proteins a, b and c  <cit> . protein p <dig> and p <dig> appear to be directly involved in receptor binding  <cit> . the hmw proteins and proteins a, b, and c are accessory proteins as they are not adhesins, but are required for proper attachment. the p <dig> protein, which is mainly concentrated at the tip of apical organelle, is one of the major adhesins in m. pneumoniae as mutants lacking the p <dig> protein lose cytadherence and virulence capabilities  <cit> . in addition, treatment of m. pneumoniae infection with anti-p <dig> antibodies has been shown to effect the gliding speed of m. pneumoniae, thus hampering the mobility of the bacterium and possibly its ability to find suitable host adhesion receptors  <cit> . besides its role in m. pneumoniae cytadherence, p <dig> antigen is an important immunogen and is also being developed as defined and specific antigen for the serodiagnosis of m. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . previous reports and we have shown that a c-terminal region of p <dig> antigen can comparably diagnose m. pneumoniae infection taking the serion-virion elisa as the standard  <cit> . serum samples from patients suffering from m. pneumoniae infection have also been shown to bind the peptide fragments located in the middle of the ~170 kda p <dig> antigens  <cit> .

since p <dig> is one of the major surface molecules on the apical organelles of m. pneumoniae, a number of studies have been performed to determine its immunogenicity as well as to characterize its role in adhesion/cytadherence. using λgt <dig> recombinant dna expression library of m. pneumoniae, dallo et al. for the first time identified cytadherence  at the c-terminal region of p <dig> gene  <cit> . subsequently, in two independent studies based on topological mapping of the p <dig> binding sites, gerstenecker et al. and opitz et al. identified adherence associated region across the length of p <dig> gene  <cit> . jacobs et al. further defined immunodominant epitopes of  <dig> amino acids between leucine  <dig> and leucine  <dig> residues  <cit> . in  <dig>  svenstrup et al. expressed p <dig> fragments lacking the tryptophan codon which codes for a stop codon in m. pneumoniae and identified adhesion epitopes in the c-terminal part of m. pneumoniae p <dig> gene using monospecific antibodies  <cit> .

although these above mentioned studies identified few adhesion/cytadherence segment in m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein, a systematic study defining the region involved in these processes across the entire length of p <dig> protein is lacking, therefore leading to contradicting results. one of the main reasons for the lack of a systematic study is the presence of  <dig> uga codons, which makes it difficult to express this protein or its fragments in heterologus systems such as escherichia coli or mammalian systems. to circumvent this problem, pcr-based site-directed mutagenesis may have been one of method to replace tga codons in p <dig> gene as mentioned by hames et al. <cit> , but we decided to synthesize the entire p <dig> gene into four different fragments by codon optimization. this included the n-terminal  fragment, two middle fragments p1-ii and p1-iii and a c-terminal  fragment, which have been suggested to be immunodominant and to act as adhesins  <cit> . all these fragments were cloned and expressed in an e. coli system  <cit> . the immunological and cytadherence characterization of all the four p <dig> protein fragments identified specific cytadherence regions. these results will enable to define strategies for the development of drug/vaccine against m. pneumoniae infection.

RESULTS
cloning, expression and purification of p <dig> gene fragments
four fragments of the m. pneumoniae p <dig> gene, i.e., p1-i, p1-ii, p1-iii, & p1-iv , were amplified by pcr, cloned in expression vector pet28b and expressed in e. coli bl <dig> cells. the expressed proteins were analyzed on sds-page. as shown in figure 2a, four proteins of molecular weights: ~39 kda, ~38 kda, ~73 kda, and ~43 kda were induced and they were mainly expressed in inclusion bodies. the expressions of recombinant proteins were further confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-6xhis antibody . the expressed proteins were purified up to near homogeneity on a ni2+-nta column . fractions that contained single band for each of the recombinant protein were pooled, dialyzed and further characterized. the expressed and purified proteins reacted nicely with anti-6xhis antibody .

recombinant rp1-i, rp1-ii, rp1-iii and rp1-iv proteins are immunogenic
high antibody responses were seen against each of the four recombinant proteins. the time course response for each of the recombinant proteins showed that the antibody titers gradually increased after first and second booster and peaked after the second boost. an additional figure file  shows the time dependent response for recombinant p1-i protein. almost similar antigenic responses were observed for other three p <dig> protein fragments . the end point titers for each protein were > 1 ×  <dig>  western blotting for all the four recombinant proteins with their respective antibodies confirmed the specificity of each antibody. all these antibodies showed major reactivity with ~170 kda band of p <dig> protein in m. pneumoniae lysate by elisa  and western blotting. anti-p <dig> antibodies also reacted with few additional bands in m. pneumoniae lysate. these additional bands probably represent the degraded p <dig> protein bands . no cross reactivity was observed between each of the four antibodies . almost similar reactivity was observed with two other p <dig> protein fragments rp1-ii & rp1-iii . these results indicated that all the four p <dig> protein fragments are immunogenic and antibodies are specific as they only recognized the corresponding protein fragment. pre-bleed and control rabbit sera showed no reactivity with any of the recombinant protein fragments. an additional figure file  shows the reactivity of each protein fragment with pre-bleed sera.

recombinant rp1-i, rp1-ii, rp1-iii and rp1-iv proteins were recognized by anti-m. pneumoniae antibody and by sera of m. pneumoniae infected patients
all the four recombinant proteins were analyzed for their reactivity to anti-m. pneumoniae antibody and pooled sera of m. pneumoniae infected patients. to do so, 1 μg of each recombinant protein was loaded on sds-page gel  and the proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. as shown in figures 4a-ii & iii, all the four proteins showed similar reactivity with either of the two sera. we next compared the reactivity of the four recombinant proteins with fifteen and twenty-five sera of m. pneumoniae infected patients by western blot analysis and by elisa respectively. figures 4b &5a shows the reactivity of the recombinant proteins with sera of m. pneumoniae infected patients. similar reactivity was seen for each of the four recombinant p <dig> protein fragments, thereby suggesting that the immunodominant regions are distributed across the entire length of p <dig> protein.

m. pneumoniae adhesion and surface exposure assays reveal that p1-i and p1-iv regions are surface exposed.
for the adhesion assay, hep- <dig> cells were infected with m. pneumoniae and methanol fixed before exposing them with each of the four anti-p <dig> antibodies; pab , pab , pab , and pab  antibody. the bound antibodies were detected with an fitc-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. as shown in figure  <dig> , indirect immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that the antibodies, pab  and pab  failed to identify the bound organism to hep- <dig> cells.

to detect the accessibility of the antibodies on the surface of the cytadhering m. pneumoniae, the primary antibodies were added before fixation with methanol. the bound primary antibodies were detected with fitc-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg antibody followed by immunofluorescence microscopy. as seen in the case of adhesion detection assay, only the antibodies pabs, rp1-i and rp1-iv were able to detect cytadhering m. pneumoniae, while no fluorescence was observed when antibodies pabs,  and  were used .

m. pneumoniae adhesion inhibition assay
to examine the ability of each of the specific antibodies to block m. pneumoniae binding to hep- <dig> cells, each of the four antibodies were diluted in four different concentrations 1: <dig>  1: <dig>  1: <dig> and 1: <dig> . the diluted antibodies were incubated with the m. pneumoniae before infection with the hep- <dig> cells. the m. pneumoniae attached to the hep- <dig> cells were visualized by anti-m. pneumoniae sera and secondary fitc-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg antibody. among these four specific antibodies, pab  and pab  inhibited the adhesion of m. pneumoniae to the hep- <dig> cells . the inhibition was maximum at highest concentration of antibody  and inhibition decreased as concentration of antibodies decreased and almost no inhibition were seen with the minimum concentration of antibody . in an independent experiment, we also performed dapi staining to confirm adhesion inhibition by pab  and pab  antibodies . importantly, antibodies; pab  and pab  failed to block the m. pneumoniae adhesion to hep- <dig> cells even at the maximum antibody concentration  . taken together, these results suggested that p1-i and p1-iv regions of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein are surface exposed and are involved in cytadherence.

discussion
the human respiratory pathogen m. pneumoniae adheres to erythrocytes/respiratory epithelial cells. p <dig> has been shown to be a major adhesion protein  <cit> . a number of studies using synthetic peptides and monoclonal antibodies against the native p <dig> protein have illustrated that the p <dig> epitopes are involved in the adhesion and immune-recognition; however a complete topological mapping of p1-adhesin is still lacking  <cit> . in the present study, we segmented the entire p <dig> gene in four regions; p1-i , p1-ii , p1-iii  & p1-iv  beginning from start residue, atg and ending with the stop codon. these segments were synthesized by codon optimization replacing all the uga codons to ugg codons. the p <dig> fragments were expressed in e. coli system and all these fragments were expressed in inclusion bodies. a protocol was developed to purify these protein fragments to near homogeneity and to obtain these proteins in large amount.

the testing of p <dig> protein fragments with anti-m. pneumoniae sera and sera of m. pneumoniae infected patients revealed that all these protein fragments were recognized by these sera, thereby suggesting that the immunodominant regions are distributed across the entire length of the protein. these results are in agreement with a number of previous reports that showed the presence of immunodominant regions either in the n-, middle and c-terminal segments of p <dig> protein  <cit> . a number of previous reports have shown the presence of immunodominant epitopes usually in the c-terminal of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein  <cit> , but few reports also showed immunodominant regions in the middle and extreme n-terminal  <cit> . a comparative summary of these results is presented in additional figure file  <dig> . however, our’s is the first study that systematically scanned the full p <dig> protein for their immunodominant and cytadherence.

since p <dig> protein is considered to be the major ligand mediating attachment, we next tested the ability of the antibodies raised against the four p <dig> fragments for adhesion detection, surface exposure and adhesion inhibition assays to identify the cytadherence regions. previously, a number of studies have identified a few m. pneumoniae p <dig> regions involved in cytadherence. trypsinization of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein and ability of various fragments or peptides so generated to block cytadherence provided first evidence for the role of p <dig> protein in cytadherence  <cit> . baseman et al., later showed that the treatment of m. pneumoniae with protease blocked its adherence to tracheal explants which was restored when p <dig> was re-generated  <cit> . role of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein in cytadherence was further substantiated by a study where pre-treatment of m. pneumoniae with antiserum directed against the p <dig> protein blocked its cytadherence to hamster tracheal ring up to 80%  <cit> . gerstenecker and jacobs  <cit>  and opitz and jacobs  <cit> , showed the involvement of n-terminal, middle and c-terminal segment of m. pneumoniae  as well as m. genitalium  in cytadherence. although a number of above mentioned studies have highlighted the role of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein in cytadherence, however a systematic study spanning the entire length of p <dig> protein is missing. we performed a systematic analysis of surface exposure and cytadherence region for m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein fragments spanning the entire length. our results showed that the antibodies against p1-i and p1-iv corresponding to n- and c- terminal regions of p <dig> protein recognized the surface of adhesive mycoplasmas and blocked their attachment when mycoplasmas were pre-incubated with these antibodies. based on the result presented here, it can be concluded that the adherence regions are located in the n- terminal and c- terminal regions. interestingly, pab  and pab  antibodies failed to block the cytadherence. the finding of an attachment regions located in the c-terminal part of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein was consistent with a number of previous studies  <cit> . summary of the various p <dig> cytadherence mapping regions is presented in additional figure file  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
present study describes a systematic approach to delineate the immunodominant and cytadherent regions across the entire length of m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein. our results showed that the immunodominant regions are present in several positions across the entire length of the m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein, while the n- terminal and c- terminal regions of the protein are surface exposed and antibodies to these two regions significantly block the adhesion. this data plus data from earlier observations thus confirms the functional significance for m. pneumoniae p <dig> protein in adhesion and immunodiagnosis. these results may have important implications in the development of tools for anti-mycoplasma drug/vaccine development.
