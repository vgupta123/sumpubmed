BACKGROUND
fitness of insecticide resistance mechanisms  can impact the evolution of resistance in the field, as well as the persistence of the resistance phenotype in untreated environments  <cit> . models of resistance evolution within a pest population are based on the premise that resistance mutations occur only rarely, but are strongly favored in insecticide treated environments. conversely, if in the absence of insecticide selection pressures resistant individuals suffer a fitness cost, the frequency of the resistance allele will decrease and the population will revert towards susceptibility  <cit> . in the absence of insecticide, resistant insects have been found to be less successful at overwintering  <cit> , mating  <cit> , predator avoidance and parasite resistance  <cit> , and general development  <cit> . if no cost is associated with the resistance allele in the absence of insecticide, then it is possible for the resistance allele to become fixed in a population.

determining the fitness of an insecticide resistance allele  <cit>  is difficult, but can be undertaken using allele competition experiments between genetically related strains  <cit> . a number of methods and variables are used to assess fitness of a resistance allele. one common approach tracks allele frequencies of a population either in an untreated environment through time  <cit>  or at one time point over a transect that includes areas that are insecticide treated and untreated  <cit> . the former of these two types of studies can be conducted in the laboratory using population cages  <cit> . in population cage experiments, when allele frequencies decrease, increase or remain constant through time, they are considered costly, beneficial or neutral, respectively. failure to detect a fitness cost could be due to fitness associated with the focal allele truly being beneficial or neutral, evolution of a compensatory mutation that mitigates the cost of the resistance allele  <cit> , or the correlated antagonistic pleiotropy maybe undetectable . a second type of methodology compares biological components of fitness, such as mating competition, longevity, and reproductive output, between populations of interest  <cit> . for either method, fitness costs or benefits are most meaningful when genetically related strains are used, and may be observed more easily if alleles are in competition with each other  <cit> . fitness costs may be manifested under most conditions, or only under certain environments, such as when populations are at high densities or resources are poor or scarce  <cit> .

examining the fitness of a resistant pest species in different environments, including an insecticide-free environment, is important for creating successful and sustainable resistance management, for maintaining insecticide effectiveness by elucidating the dynamics of the resistance allele and for providing information for optimal timing of insecticide rotations  <cit> . we conducted a laboratory population cage study using genetically related strains of the mosquito culex pipiens quinquefasciatus  subjected to environmental conditions that are relevant to the type of stresses this mosquito species could be exposed to in the field. altering the environmental stresses in a laboratory setting allowed us to avoid confounding variables  that could also act on field populations of mosquitoes.

cx. p. quinquefasciatus are important vectors of pathogens that infect both humans and other animals. this species is the primary vector of the filarial nematode wuchereria bancrofti  <cit> . it is also capable of transmitting west nile virus   <cit> , bird malaria pathogens, dog heartworm , avian pox virus, and st. louis encephalitis in the united states  <cit> . insecticides are the major tool for mosquito control, therefore insecticide resistance is an important and ever increasing problem in control efforts  <cit> .

pyrethroid resistance in the culex pipiens complex has been recorded around the world  <cit> . resistance to pyrethroid compounds in culex mosquitoes is conferred by two major mechanisms, enhanced detoxification by cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases  <cit>  as well as target site insensitivity   <cit> . previously, we isolated a permethrin resistant  strain of cx. p. quinquefasciatus  which was > <dig> % related to the susceptible lab strain slab. permethrin resistance in isop <dig> is monofactorial and due solely to cytochrome p450-mediated detoxification  <cit> .

we were interested in determining if, and how quickly, the p <dig> resistance allele frequency would change when it was placed in competition with the susceptible allele under environmental stress. our hypothesis was that under environmental stress the p <dig> detoxification resistance allele would be costly. since this p <dig> detoxification mechanism was previously shown to be larval specific  <cit> , measurements were conducted on larvae to see if associated costs were present. the environmental conditions imposed in the laboratory included insecticide-free standard rearing procedures, larval exposure to temephos, a commonly used organophosphate in mosquito control programs which is bioactivated  by the p <dig> resistance mechanism  <cit> , as well as larval exposure to a cold temperature  which represents the northern boundary for cx. p. quinquefasciatus in its native geographic range. this experimental regime allowed us to examine the fitness associated with the cytochrome p450-mediated permethrin resistance mechanism in isop <dig>  in relation to known environmental stresses, as well as providing a greater understanding of resistance evolution when insecticide selection is relaxed.

RESULTS
our results show that fitness costs are associated with the cytochrome p450-mediated permethrin detoxification resistance allele in cx. p. quinquefasciatus  and that the strength of the cost varies depending on the environmental conditions. when fitness is assessed using resistant  allele frequencies, p <dig> detoxification is most costly in the temephos exposed environment, costly in the standard laboratory environment, and not costly in the cold temperature environment. detailed results from each of the three environmental conditions are discussed below.

standard laboratory rearing conditions
in the absence of insecticide, the r allele frequency decreased from a starting frequency of  <dig>  to  <dig>  in f <dig> . while the frequency differences were not found to be statistically different due to the variation between the replicates , throughout the experiment the trend of a declining r allele frequency was steady with an exception at f <dig> where a larger dip occurred. examination of the genotypes shows that the homozygous resistant genotype  decreases, and for most generations stays below  <dig>  . this trend was observed for both crosses  and for both replicates for each of these crosses, although there was some variation between generations . this data indicates that the fitness cost of being rr is greater than the cost of having a single r allele in this environment. interestingly, the rs genotype stays at a frequency of approximately  <dig> , while the ss genotype tends to increase in frequency over the  <dig> generations . frequency changes in the three genotypes ultimately leads to the trend of a decreasing frequency of the r allele and an increase in the s allele frequency.

across all replicates, there are multiple generations where the genotype frequencies are not in hardy-weinberg equilibrium indicating that selection or genetic drift are acting on these generations . this is true for f <dig> through f <dig> in cross a#1; f <dig> through f <dig> in cross b#1; and f <dig> through f <dig>  excluding f <dig>  in cross b# <dig>  using the allele frequency data, the null hypothesis of frequency changes being due to genetic drift can not be rejected for f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> of cross a#1; f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> of cross a#2; f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> of cross b#1; and f <dig> and f <dig> in cross b# <dig>  however, many of the same generations that reject genetic drift are also out of hardy-weinberg equilibrium . this means that despite being in a laboratory setting where many conditions are optimized , these populations were probably undergoing selection and not genetic drift  since the generations are out of hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and there was no assortative mating.

temephos exposure
the temephos exposed environment proved to be extremely detrimental to the maintenance of the r allele and rr genotype and more costly than the standard laboratory condition. the p <dig> detoxification r allele dramatically decreases from the f <dig> to the f <dig> generation where the frequency drops significantly to  <dig>  from  <dig>  . between generations  <dig> and  <dig> the frequency plateaus, but given enough time, the r allele should be eliminated since at these two time points the r alleles are primarily in the heterozygotes . the genotype pattern follows that expected from our original hypothesis. in the temephos exposed environment the rr genotype almost completely disappears, the rs genotype decreases from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , while the ss genotype undergoes an increase in frequency  where two of the four cages become fixed for the s allele. in cage a# <dig>  the rr and rs genotype are completely eliminated by generation f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively and in cage a# <dig> by f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively. the elimination of the r allele is more rapid in the a cross versus the b cross, though the b cross has a matching pattern where the r allele decreases through time and the rr genotype is eliminated from the population . as expected, the temephos treated replicates are undergoing selection since they are out of hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and this is not due to drift . a previous study found the p <dig> present in isop <dig> bioactivates temephos, and that this p <dig> is tightly linked to  the permethrin resistance allele  <cit> . this is likely one reason why the r allele in this environment is even more costly to the animal and is eliminated at a faster rate than the r allele in the standard laboratory environment.

cold temperature environment
in the cold temperature environment, no fitness cost of the p <dig> detoxification r allele frequency was observed. despite frequency shifts between generations, the r allele stays in equilibrium around the  <dig>  frequency level . while this equilibrium is slightly lower than the initial  <dig> , the frequency at f <dig> is not statistically different from  <dig>  . in three of the four cages  the rr genotype decreases to frequencies of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. surprisingly, there was a clear heterozygote advantage which allowed the r allele to persist in the cold temperature treated population . the ss genotype remains at frequencies close to the f <dig> starting frequency, ending in the f <dig> generation at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for cages a# <dig>  b# <dig> and b# <dig>  respectively. despite the a# <dig> cage rr frequency in generation  <dig> being  <dig>  and the ss genotype frequency being  <dig>  there was still a heterozygote advantage evident in this cage . almost all  of the monitored generations are out of hardy-weinberg equilibrium  and the null hypothesis that drift is acting on the generations was rejected  , indicating that cold selection is driving the changes in genotype and allele frequencies.

discussion
our results show that the fitness associated with cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase-mediated permethrin resistance in cx. p. quinquefasciatus varies according to the environment. we demonstrate a cost associated with this p <dig> detoxification mechanism when in competition with a susceptible allele under standard rearing conditions, and a greater cost when exposed to temephos. we also reveal a heterozygote advantage when in the cold temperature environment.

while a fitness cost was observed in the standard and temephos condition, no overall cost  of the r allele for this p <dig> locus was observed in the cold temperature environment. intriguingly, all four replicates in the cold environment exhibited an excess of the heterozygote genotype. the rr genotype in all replicates did poorly, indicating that having two r alleles is costly. a similar pattern was shown in tribolium castaneum where the susceptible allele was placed in direct competition with an allele that conferred malathion resistance . over the  <dig> generations of the experiment, malathion resistant strains had a heterozygote advantage and the best fitness  <cit> . observations of heterozygote advantage are rare and this phenomenon may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in populations  <cit> .

the p <dig> detoxification mechanism under temephos exposure was shown to be highly costly. in the temephos exposed environment, the rr genotype frequency was entirely eliminated in two replicates and decreased to an average frequency of  <dig>  by the f <dig> generation. hardstone et al.  demonstrated low , but significant, levels of negative cross-resistance to temephos in isop <dig>  <cit> , suggesting enhanced bioactivation of temephos to temephos-oxon in the resistant strain. this is likely one of the reasons underlying the fitness cost of the r allele in the temephos treated environment. this suggests that vector control efforts could use temephos in populations with this p <dig> mechanism because it may serve as a method to slow the evolution of permethrin resistance. in a temephos treated environment, a population with this p <dig> will not be favored and a shift towards susceptibility at this locus will occur.

many fitness studies on insecticide resistant insects have shown that resistance mechanisms  are costly  <cit> . however, no studies have looked at the fitness associated with p450-mediated resistance in mosquitoes. in this experiment we examined the fitness of the p <dig> allele under multiple environmental conditions, whereas several previous population cage studies limited the environmental condition to a relaxation of the insecticide selection pressure  <cit> . for example, the r allele in a strain of cx. p. quinquefasciatus which was resistant to organophosphates due to elevated levels of esterase- <dig> declined steadily when left unselected for  <dig> generations  <cit> .

population cage studies do not always show that a fitness cost is associated with the insecticide resistance allele. examination of malathion resistance alleles in tribolium castaneum under no known selection  pressure in a laboratory population cage experiment revealed the r allele is not costly and the frequency of this allele remained steady through time, independent of the starting r allele frequency  <cit> . fluctuations in the r allele frequency from generation to generation were concluded to be the result of random genetic drift  <cit> .

very few studies have examined what happens to the r allele in a population cage study under sub-optimal environmental conditions. raymond et al.  placed two strains of diamondback moth  with the same resistance mechanism conferring resistance to bacillus thuringiensis in two different stressful environments in the lab. the two strains exhibited different fitness costs relative to each other under the same pressure and the fitness cost varied in each environment for an individual strain  <cit> . in contrast, no fitness costs were seen for diazinon resistant australian sheep blowfly  when reared under three different larval densities or in a population cage competition experiment  <cit> .

resistance mechanisms due to metabolic processes are generally regarded as costly  <cit> . some studies have proposed that the extent to which a metabolic resistance mechanism is costly depends on the relative expression of the protein in the resistant strain versus the susceptible strain  <cit> . insecticide resistance due to gene amplification or gene duplication of general esterases is highly costly due to the resulting amount of enzyme that is produced. for example, in highly resistant green peach aphids, esterase amounts to approximately 3% of the total body protein  <cit> . contrastingly, costs associated with increased monooxygenase activity have been found to be modest or absent. this phenomena has been shown using biotic potential measures in the house fly  <cit> , laboratory, glasshouse and field studies measuring life-table parameters, predator-prey interactions, and mating competitiveness of the predatory mite, metaseiulus occidentalis  <cit> , in heliothis zea after feeding on a diet with a p <dig> inducer and measuring food utilization parameters  <cit> , and with p450-mediated resistance to ddt in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . understanding the fitness costs associated with p450-mediated resistance is further complicated because even when the same insecticide is used, there can be plasticity in which p <dig> are selected for in different populations  <cit> . this could lead to variation in fitness costs between populations, due to the different p450s conferring the resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
determining the cost of resistance is imperative for implementing successful vector control strategies. as evident from the literature and our results, resistance alleles as well as genotypes are able to perform differentially  in different environments. additionally, in accordance with previous studies on insecticide resistance mechanisms, a fitness cost is associated with this p <dig> locus in an insecticide-free environment. it is also possible that differences present in the genetic backgrounds among the crosses could affect the fitness of the resistance allele. understanding how resistant pest populations evolve under a spectrum of environmental conditions is essential if resistance management tactics are to be successful. results from this study have implications for mosquito control strategies. for example, rotating permethrin and temephos use should slow the evolution of p450-mediated permethrin resistance. additionally, the permethrin r allele can be maintained within the cold upper boundary of the cx. p. quinquefasicatus habitat, where a hybrid region with cx. p. pipiens is present. therefore, the cx. p. quinquefasicatus p <dig> r allele could be introduced into cx. p. pipiens populations and have a negative impact on the control of this species.
