BACKGROUND
one of the greatest challenges facing industry and society is the future sustainable production of chemicals and fuels from non-food resources while at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions. to date, the focus has been on the use of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks. the exploitation of biomass, however, is reliant on an energy intensive pre-treatment step, and thereafter, the addition of costly exogenous hydrolytic enzymes required to convert the partially deconstructed biomass into the sugars needed by the fermentative process organisms. the costs involved are making the development of economic processes extremely challenging  <cit> . a range of solutions are being explored to increase the economic viability of this process, including the direct microbial conversion of biomass by lignocellulose degrading organisms  <cit> . one alternative solution is to develop processes based on acetogenic bacteria such as clostridium autoethanogenum, whereby carbon is directly captured  through anaerobic gas fermentation. these bacteria are capable of growth on a spectrum of waste gases from industry . thus, gas fermentation allows the production of low carbon fuels and high-value chemicals without competing for food or land. it therefore represents an extremely versatile platform for the sustainable production of commodity chemicals and fuels.

c. autoethanogenum is a strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, spore forming, rod-like, motile bacterium. it was first isolated from rabbit faeces in  <dig> under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with carbon monoxide as the sole energy source  <cit>  and was identified as a facultative chemolithotroph  <cit> . since its isolation, this bacterium has quickly gathered interest as a potential chassis for biofuel and high-value chemical production .

as a means of further understanding this organism, and for its effective exploitation for biofuel and biochemical production by means of metabolic engineering, a draft genome sequence of c. autoethanogenum dsm <dig> was first elucidated using  <dig> gs flx titanium and ion torrent pmg techniques by bruno-barcena et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . the collection of contigs is available under the ncbi accession number gca_ <dig> . subsequently, pacific biosciences single-molecule dna sequencing technology  <cit>  was used to generate a finished genome sequence by brown et al.  that is accessible under ncbi accession number gca_ <dig>   <cit> . according to this sequence, the bacterium has a chromosome length of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs, with  <dig> predicted genes,  <dig> of which are potentially protein-coding genes with  <dig> pseudogenes present, and  <dig> rna genes. raw data from a range of sequencing techniques used by the same group has recently been published, and includes roche  <dig>  illumina truseq technology, ion torrent, pacbio rs ii, and sanger sequencing datasets  <cit> , however the deposited sequence is presently exclusively representative of the pacbio sequencing data.

in recent years, the field of next-generation sequencing has become more accessible and technologies continue to evolve at a dramatic pace, and as such many previously published genomes which have been revisited, have been updated and improved . improvements in both sequencing technologies and analysis tools have enabled a higher confidence in the generated genome sequence, and as such the coding sequence annotations also become more accurate and refined. revisiting and updating existing genome annotations is absolutely essential, as not only does it allow the opportunity to increase the users understanding of the organism in question, but it also improves accuracy for downstream users when performing automated annotations of related species  <cit> , reducing the introduction of errors caused by historic sequencing inaccuracies. revisiting existing annotations also allows application of new biological knowledge to previously uncharacterised loci, and in the case of manual annotation, allows the opportunity to standardise features such as enzymes names and functional characterisation, for better integration with models.

our detailed inspection of the brown et al. closed genome sequence identified multiple instances of coding dna sequences that were annotated as containing frame-shift mutations, where the reading frame had become disrupted. additionally, the coding region of many genes appeared to contain premature stop-codons when compared to those of the closely related acetogenic species clostridium ljungdahlii, accessible under ncbi accession number gca_ <dig>   <cit> , thus theoretically truncating the protein products. were these frame-shifts genuine it would have the effect of severely debilitating the organism’s capacity to survive. this includes the atp–dependent dna helicase recq, an important protein in genome maintenance, which appeared to contain a stop codon which truncated the full length protein into two  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid products . to further understand these apparent frame-shifts, we sequenced a stock of c. autoethanogenum dsm <dig>  purchased directly from the dsmz culture collection, using illumina miseq technology and mapped these reads onto the brown et al. finished genome sequence. we found  <dig> discrepancies compared to the finished genome sequence, the vast majority of which had the effect of ‘repairing’ the annotated frame-shift regions and premature stop-codons identified in the genome. importantly, many of those genes exhibit important cellular functions including the c <dig> metabolism underlying gas fermentation.

in the following sections, we focus on the identified differences, resulting in altered or newly introduced functional annotations and their consequences for the protein network in c. autoethanogenum, and on the underlying reasons for these discrepancies. we also highlight a possible shortcoming of the pacbio rs ii sequencing technology, which has implications for future users wishing to employ this technology for gap closing when performing de-novo sequencing. we demonstrate the importance of employing a further sequencing technology following gap closure by pacbio rs ii in order to generate a sequence with a high confidence level, and in doing so we have corrected  <dig> annotation errors in protein coding sequences brought about through apparent frameshift mutation due to under-called homopolymer regions. in culmination of our analysis, we present a corrected and fully manually curated genome for c. autoethanogenum, a step which enables a downstream user to have confidence in the annotation, as a purely automated annotation can often propagate previous errors made during annotation of related species  <cit> , and which allows the annotation to be presented in a uniform and standardised manner. this represents an important step towards accurate manipulation of the industrially relevant organism, and which may be reliably used as a basis for the generation of metabolic and genomic models.

RESULTS
analysis of the c. autoethanogenum genome by illumina sequencing reveals  <dig> discrepancies from the brown et al. finished genome sequence
following our initial observations of a number of frameshift annotations of the published genome for c. autoethanogenum, and to confirm that our stock of the organism was representative of the published strain, we performed illumina miseq on our dsm <dig> strain acquired directly from the dsmz. this generated over  <dig>  million mapped short reads with an average length of  <dig>  base pairs, resulting in an average coverage of  <dig>  with a standard deviation of  <dig> . to analyse the range of the coverage across the genome, we assessed coverage of specifically the coding regions present in the brown et al. finished genome sequence. the results confirmed that  <dig>  % of cds’s had coverage of at least  <dig> reads for 100 % of the sequence, and 100 % of cds’s had coverage of at least  <dig> reads for at least 60 % of the sequence. the distribution of coverage against all coding regions is represented graphically below . it was found previously that de-novo assembly using an illumina miseq dataset led to regions of low coverage  <cit> , however using the pacbio generated sequence as a reference appears to have alleviated this problem. the genome had  <dig> , <dig> base pairs, a g + c content of  <dig>  %, predicted  <dig> protein-coding sequences , and  <dig> rna-coding genes. the whole-genome sequencing project for c. autoethanogenum ja1- <dig> has been deposited at national center for biotechnology information  under the accession number cp <dig>  we were able to map reads using the brown et al. finished genome sequence as the reference and the software tool clc genomics workbench version  <dig>  . we observed  <dig> differences in our strain as compared to the reference . interestingly, all but one of these discrepancies were identified as single base pair insertions, and these occurred with a seemingly random distribution across the genome, both in coding and non-coding regions . large indels were also screened for using the clc genomics workbench, but none were detected.fig.  <dig> distribution of coverage of coding sequences across the genome. a visual representation of the depth of coverage of all coding sequences as generated by the brown et al. genome annotation

sanger sequencing confirms single base pair insertions
to determine whether these discrepancies were genuine differences or artefacts of the sequencing technology employed, we performed further analysis on a randomly selected sample, from those which occurred in coding regions, by sanger sequencing. primers were designed approximately  <dig> base pairs upstream and downstream of the site in question, and the resultant ~ <dig> base pair amplified product was sequenced using both forward and reverse primers by source bioscience. sanger sequencing from both forward and reverse reactions from all samples confirmed our illumina miseq data , indicating that the illumina sequencing had made the correct calls for these single base discrepancies in our strain versus the brown et al. finished genome sequence.

comparison of our sequence to that of published sequences revealed that a high percentage of our discrepancies agreed with the finished genome sequence of c. ljungdahlii and of genes located in the bruno-barcena draft genome sequence of c. autoethanogenum
the finished whole genome sequence  of c. ljungdahlii, a genus of clostridium that is phylogenetically indistinguishable from c. autoethanogenum  <cit>  and contains a very high genome sequence similarity , was published in  <dig> by köpke et al., and is available on the ncbi database . we used the nucleotide basic local alignment search tool  to search for homologous regions in c. ljungdahlii to those containing discrepancies between our finished genome sequence and the brown et al. finished genome sequence of c. autoethanogenum to determine which the corresponding sequences from c. ljungdahlii that are present agree with. we found that of the  <dig> regions that are present in c. ljungdahlii all instances confirm our c. autoethanogenum finished genome sequence. furthermore, we performed protein blast searches against the amino acid sequences of each discrepancy that occurred within a protein-coding region . of these,  <dig> coding regions are also present in c. ljungdahlii, and  <dig> are represented within the contigs of the bruno-barcena draft genome sequence.  <dig> coding sequences from c. ljungdahlii are identical to those found in our finished genome sequence, and the two that were not also did not agree with the brown et al. finished genome sequence. of the  <dig> coding-regions present within contigs of the bruno-barcena draft genome sequence,  <dig> agreed with our sequencing and the four that did not also did not agree with the brown et al. finished genome sequence . in summary, through direct comparison with both the c. ljungdahlii finished genome sequence and the bruno-barcena draft genome sequence, we can be confident that our illumina sequence has called the correct bases in these instances.

a detailed review of the automated annotation of these proteins in the brown et al. finished genome revealed that many of the discrepancies caused frame-shifts that resulted in premature or multiple stop codons to occur within the sequences . moreover, the majority of these discrepancies  occurred in homopolymer regions greater than five bases in length  and the change present in each of these occurrences was the insertion of an additional monomer in our illumina sequence, suggesting a tendency for calling strings of homopolymers short by pacbio technology at the time of publication of the brown et al. finished genome sequence.

investigation of the origin reveals a previously undiscovered additional  <dig> base pair insertion
one identified discrepancy occurred at the beginning of the genome sequence assembly, where we observed a  <dig> base pair  deletion. investigation of this deletion by sanger sequencing with primers ~350 bp upstream and downstream of the origin revealed a previously unidentified additional 181 bp. as neither the previous pacbio sequencing nor our own illumina assembly revealed this insertion we performed a blast search of the region against c. ljungdahlii  to confirm its presence in the closely related acetogen. the start point for the assembly of c. ljungdahlii is in a different location to that of c. autoethanogenum finished genome sequences. the additional bases were present in c. ljungdahlii upstream of the mopi gene, which is in the same location as c. autoethanogenum relative to their cds. the additional bases are in a non-coding region of the genome in both organisms.

manual annotation of our c. autoethanogenum finished genome provides a reliable reference for those working with this anaerobic acetogen
our c. autoethanogenum finished sequence was uploaded to the genome annotation system gendb  <cit> , a user-friendly framework for genome assessment, annotation and curation. annotation of the genome sequence was performed using gendb version  <dig>   <cit> . region prediction in the gendb package is realized by the tools prodigal  <cit>  for coding sequences, trnascane-se  <cit>  for trnas and rnammer  <cit>  for rrnas. the brown et al. c. autoethanogenum strain dsm  <dig> finished genome sequence  <cit>  was used as a reference for annotation with the following parameters e-value cut-off 10− <dig>  with combined identity of 25 %, which means 50 % identity for 50 % of the length of the gene. this automatic annotation resulted in  <dig> perfect matches,  <dig> matches with a different length.

following automatic assignments, annotation of the identified orfs was performed based on sequence similarity searches against sequence databases and subsequent manual curation and annotation using gendb  <dig>   <cit> . sequence similarity analyses were accomplished using blastx  <cit>  against the ncbi non-redundant database on protein level  <cit> , the swissprot database  <cit>  and kegg  <cit> . additionally, manual gene annotation was performed using priam  <cit> , motif scan  <cit> , prosite  <cit> , brenda  <cit> , uniprot/swissprot  <cit> , interproscan  <cit> , and pfam  <cit>  databases. one example of how our manual annotation differed from that of the automated pipeline used by brown et al. can be found in the case of clau_ <dig> . here the automated pipeline from the brown et al. finished genome assigned this gene product as a hypothetical protein, however when the sequence was aligned using blastp as part of our manual curation all other proteins with >75 % identity were named sodium abc transporter. upon further inspection in pfam, one large abc- <dig> family transporter protein domain was found . similar searches of uniprot and kegg databases agreed with pfam, therefore we annotated this gene product as an abc- <dig> family transporter. the correction of the previously short-called homopolymer reads through our sequencing efforts gave a fully annotated finished sequence of c. autoethanogenum without the erroneous frame-shift containing annotations which had occurred previously.

using these tools we were able to manually curate the entire genome to ensure that the automated annotation was correct and to insert additional information where required, as well as implementing a standardised protein product naming system as recommend by the ncbi guidelines  <cit>  for ease of identification of genes with related functions. as a consequence of the automated and subsequent manual curation, we have found  <dig> instances across the genome where genes previously identified as ‘hypothetical protein’ have either been assigned a specific function, or have been named through identification of conserved domains based on sequence similarity. we have also encountered  <dig> instances where the annotation of a gene product in the brown et al. finished sequence has been made less specific, or indeed reverted to ‘hypothetical protein’, as our searches have not been able to identify sufficient evidence to assign a specific function. the most common cause for the latter was previous identification of a gene product based on a minor region of coverage with homology to a distantly related species. through comparison of the results of each protein sequence alignment to a broad selection of databases, we were able in some cases to correct and improve upon the automated annotation, highlighting the importance of manual curation where possible. this has supplied us with a robust and comprehensively annotated sequence for subsequent work with this industrially relevant acetogen . the complete list of gene products with an altered function from those previously described in the brown et al. genome annotation is provided in additional file  <dig> 

identification of coding sequences not previously detected in the brown et al. genome annotation
through application of the gene finding tool prodigal, we have identified eight additional coding sequences which were not identified in the previous annotation, including one gene which has been annotated through sequence similarity as a m <dig> family peptidase , and one identified as a 3-oxoacyl- synthase  <dig> family protein . the following novel genes were all identified as ‘hypothetical proteins’; clau_ <dig>  clau_ <dig>  clau_ <dig>  clau_ <dig> and clau_ <dig>  as a consequence of the correction of multiple frameshift mutations, many coding sequences previously annotated as two separate genes due to an erroneous stop codon have now been rectified into a single coding region, and as such our annotated genome now contains  <dig> coding sequences, whereas the brown et al. annotation at the time of publication contained  <dig> coding sequences.

discussion
the current greatest technical challenge for creating single closed whole genome sequences is the presence of long stretches of repetitive dna within those sequences, which hinders the assembly of shorter dna reads into larger scaffolds and finished whole genome sequences. many of the current technologies, including illumina miseq, ion torrent and  <dig> gs flx+ titanium give read lengths in the region of 100– <dig> base pairs, which compared with repetitive sequence lengths commonly found in bacteria of 5– <dig> kb  <cit> , is insufficient to create a single closed sequence without manual finishing, which can be costly and time-consuming.

the pacbio rs ii sequencing system, used by brown et al.  <cit>  for generation of a closed wgs of c. autoethanogenum, was until recently the only long-read single-molecule sequencer available, and is capable of simplifying the process of genome assembly due to greatly increased read lengths  <cit> . reads in excess of  <dig> kb have been reported utilising the pacbio system  <cit> , compared with illumina miseq generating average read lengths of  <dig> base pairs in this study. thus, the utilisation of pacbio systems for the generation of closed wgs’s from organisms that do not currently have such a sequence is highly advantageous in terms of both time and cost. however, it has been found that the error rate for pacbio sequencing is relatively high when compared to illumina sequencing data  <cit> , especially concerning homopolymer regions between two and fourteen base pairs in length  <cit> . in our study, we demonstrated a heavy bias towards under-calling of homopolymer regions, which in this example led to ~ <dig> erroneous deletions from the ~ <dig>  mb genome of c. autoethanogenum. this high error rate is in-line with previous findings on long-read assemblies  <cit> , and in recent years improvements to the algorithms used by pacbio have had the consequence of reducing the overall error rate significantly. however, it may still be the case that the pacbio system should ideally be used in conjunction with other forms of sequencing following pacbio assembly, such as illumina miseq and sanger sequencing, to ensure accuracy of the data, certainly for assemblies performed with earlier iterations of the pacbio technology, as is the case with the dataset in question here. the recently released oxford nanopore technology has potential to further revolutionise the field of genome sequencing over the coming years, allowing label-free, ultra-long reads , with the capability for extremely high throughput, and low material requirement  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the whole genome sequence of c. autoethanogenum presented here-in represents a correction of the sequencing errors present in the previously published closed genome sequence generated primarily from an early iteration of pacbio sequencing technology. it was annotated via an automated pipeline and further curated manually to ensure the quality of annotation. this has resulted in the generation of the most accurate closed-genome sequence of the industrially relevant acetogen c. autoethanogenum to date and is an important step forward for academic institutions and industrial companies that wish to study and / or manipulate this organism for the purposes of high-value chemical production.
