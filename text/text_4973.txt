BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum  is a highly dynamic organelle that is involved in major cellular functions, such as protein synthesis, the folding and processing of newly synthesized secretory proteins, protein quality control and the maintenance of ca2+ homeostasis. due to the tight regulation of er homeostasis, this organelle is also involved in the activation of cellular stress responses  <cit> . the perturbation of er homeostasis caused by er stress often promotes the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen, which triggers a cytoprotective signaling pathway referred to as the unfolded protein response   <cit> . in mammalian cells, the upr operates as a tripartite module, and the er stress signal is transduced through the er membrane receptors protein kinase-like er kinase , inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase and endonuclease 1α  and activation of transcription factor  <dig>   <cit> .

in plants, the upr arms, which are mediated by ire <dig> homologs and atf6-related receptors, have been extensively characterized in arabidopsis and to some extent in rice and maize . upon disruption of er homeostasis, plant cells activate at least two branches of the upr through ire1-like and atf6-like transducers, resulting in the up-regulation of er-resident molecular chaperones and activation of the er-associated protein degradation system. recently, a plasma membrane-associated member of the plant-specific nac domain-containing tf family, atnac <dig>  has been demonstrated to undergo cross-talk with er stress signaling pathways to activate upr-induced promoters, highlighting a unique aspect of this highly conserved upr response in plants  <cit> .

plant ire <dig> homologs contain an ire-like receptor configuration with a stress sensor luminal domain at the n-terminus, a transmembrane segment, and c-terminal kinase and ribonuclease domains. two ire <dig> homologs have been found in arabidopsis  and maize and one has been identified in rice  . the substrate for arabidopsis ire <dig> endonuclease activity is the transcript of the er membrane-associated tf bzip <dig>  <cit> . in response to er stress, the endonuclease activity of ire <dig> mediates the splicing of bzip <dig> mrna to generate an alternatively spliced transcript that lacks transmembrane domain-encoding sequences. this splicing leads to the synthesis of a soluble and functional bzip transfactor that can be translocated to the nucleus, where it activates er stress-inducible promoters.

the second branch of the upr in plants mechanistically resembles the mammalian atf6-mediated transduction of the er stress signal. the atf <dig> arabidopsis orthologs include two er-localized, membrane-tethered tfs, bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> . in the absence of stress, plant bip is bound to arabidopsis atf6-like bzip <dig>  which remains in the er membrane  <cit> . in response to er stress, bip dissociates from bzip <dig>  allowing it to be redirected to the golgi, where it is proteolytically processed by s1p/s2p and released from the membrane  <cit> . the released bzip domain of this transfactor is then translocated to the nucleus, where it acts in concert with the heterotrimeric nf-y complex to activate upr genes  <cit> . in addition to er stress, bzip <dig> is primarily induced by salt stress, a condition that also promotes its regulated movement to the golgi and s1p/s2p-mediated cleavage, thereby releasing its n-terminal tf domain for translocation to the nucleus, where it acts in concert with bzip <dig> to activate salt stress-responsive promoters and a fraction of er stress-induced promoters  <cit> . heat stress induces the expression, s1p/s2p-mediated processing and nuclear translocation of the bzip <dig> tf  <cit> . maize zmbzip <dig> has been shown to directly link er stress with aba signaling  <cit> , and both bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> connect er stress and heat stress with br signaling  <cit> .

the upr-mediated activation of bzip <dig>  bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> promotes the induction of er-resident molecular chaperones, such as bip, erdj, grp <dig>  cnx, crt, peptidylprolyl isomerases  and thiol disulfide oxidoreductases , through binding to the promoters of the stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements upre-i and upre-ii  <cit> . bzip <dig> also transactivates the nac <dig> promoter through interaction with a distinct stress-responsive cis-regulatory element, upre-iii  <cit> . in turn, the nac <dig> tf amplifies the upr signal by further activating several upr-related chaperones, including crt <dig>  cnx, and pdi- <dig>  <cit> . downstream components of the upr also include components of the erad machinery, including homologs of edems , os <dig> , hrd <dig>  hrd3/sel1l  and derlin- <dig>   <cit> . therefore, under moderate stress conditions, the upr-mediated induction of er-resident chaperones and erad genes promotes er quality control processes to re-establish er homeostasis. however, under prolonged and severe stress, if er functioning and cell growth cannot be restored, then a cell death program is triggered, presumably to protect the organism from aberrant cells that contain unfolded proteins.

one such plant-specific er stress-induced cell death response has been recently shown to be mediated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the er membrane-tethered nac <dig> tf  <cit> . in response to er stress, nac <dig> is relocated to the nucleus to control the expression of downstream genes involved in pcd, such as nac <dig>  mc <dig> and bag <dig>  because the expression of nac <dig> is controlled by bzip <dig> and bzip <dig>  during the plant er stress response, these upr transducers also elicit pro-death signals, a property that is shared by their mammalian counterparts. a distinct plant-specific er stress-induced cell death response that integrates an osmotic stress signal into a full pcd response has been reported in soybean and is mediated by the developmental cell death domain -containing n-rich proteins dcd/nrp-a and dcd/nrp-b  <cit> . the expression of dcd/nrp is controlled by the er and osmotic stress-induced tf gmerd <dig>  which specifically binds to the dcd/nrp promoters to activate the transcription of these genes  <cit> . enhanced dcd/nrp accumulation causes the induction of the plant-specific tfs gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig>  which interact to fully activate expression of the vacuolar processing enzyme , a plant-specific executioner of programmed cell death  that displays caspase-1-like activity  <cit> . therefore, gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and vpe are involved in a plant-specific regulatory cascade that integrates osmotic stress- and er stress-induced pcd.

comprehensive genome-wide evaluations of er stress-induced changes in gene expression have provided evidence that the upr operates in a similar fashion in both soybean and arabidopsis  <cit> . nevertheless, genes involved in the er stress response are poorly characterized in soybean, and except for er stress-induced nrp-mediated cell death signaling, no other branches of er stress signaling have been examined at the gene level in this plant. in addition, upstream transducers of the upr have not been functionally or mechanistically identified in the soybean genome. in this investigation, we conducted a complete survey of upstream, immediate downstream and downstream components of the er stress response in soybean. additionally, we examined the possible transducer functions of soybean ire <dig> homologs and bzip28/bzip17-related receptors. our in silico analyses, along with current and previous functional data, have generated a comprehensive overview of the er stress response in soybean.

RESULTS
the high conservation of the er stress response in different plant species, such as arabidopsis and rice, along with the accurate assembly of the soybean genome sequence  <cit> , allowed for the in silico identification of components of different branches of the upr  in addition to those of the plant-specific er stress-induced cell death response . because the plant upr is transduced as a bipartite module that converges in an adaptive response, we have presented our data in the following groups to facilitate comprehension: upr transducers/sensors, upr immediate downstream components and upr downstream components . the corresponding gene copy numbers in the soybean genome are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig> copy numbers of upr genes



identification of transducers/sensors and immediate downstream components of the upr
previously characterized arabidopsis upr genes were used as prototypes for the identification of the soybean orthologs and the in silico assembly of the upr in soybean. using eggnog v <dig>  software, the upr bzip transducers bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> were grouped into the virnog <dig> group, which was comprised of the three genes encoding bzip <dig>  bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> . a search for the bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> prototypes in eggnog v <dig>  against the williams  <dig> v <dig>  whole-genome sequence  <cit>  revealed two predicted soybean orthologs  as the soybean representatives in the virnog <dig> group. a blastp search revealed that both of the soybean bzip gene orthologs were more closely related to bzip <dig> . glyma.03g <dig>  displayed  <dig>  % similarity and 48 % identity to bzip <dig> with 96 % protein sequence coverage, and glyma.19g <dig>  was  <dig>  % similar and  <dig>  % identical to bzip <dig> with 94 % coverage. the use of the bzip <dig> amino acid sequence for comparison resulted in decreases in the similarity and identity of glyma.03g <dig>  to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, with 80 % coverage, whereas glyma.19g <dig>  displayed  <dig>  % similarity and  <dig>  % identity with 81 % coverage . this level of sequence conservation did not allow us to distinguish between the bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> soybean orthologs; hence, both gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> were assigned as bzip17/ <dig> orthologs .

the immediate downstream components of the bzip-mediated upr arm, which are involved in the er stress-induced mobilization and golgi-mediated processing of bzip <dig> and bzip <dig>  were also analyzed with eggnog v <dig> . these components included site- <dig> protease , a soluble luminal protease, site- <dig> protease , a membrane-associated metalloprotease, sar <dig>  a small gtpase involved in the formation of prebudding complexes for copii-mediated relocation of cargo from the er to the golgi, and sec <dig>  a copii vesicle element  <cit> . the copy numbers of the soybean orthologs are shown in table  <dig>  and the e-value showed a high level of conservation of homologous regions between ortholog pairs .

the arabidopsis genome contains three copies of the ire genes, but only ire1a  and ire1b  encode full-length proteins . our in silico analysis recovered ire1a and ire1b and clustered them into the virnog <dig> group, which encompassed four predicted soybean ire orthologs. a blastp search revealed that the glyma.01g <dig> , glyma.09g <dig>  and glyma.11g <dig>  predicted proteins were the most similar to arabidopsis ire1a , whereas glyma.16g <dig>  was the most similar to ire1b . the e-value showed the high conservation of homologous regions among the orthologous proteins.

a striking feature of the soybean genome is the retention of extended blocks of duplicated genes  <cit> . approximately 75 % of the  <dig>  high-confidence genes predicted to be present in the soybean genome exist as paralogs, and 25 % have reverted to singletons  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis and soybean ire orthologs belonging to the virnog <dig> group  showed that the four soybean ire paralogs were clustered in pairs, consistent with duplication events .

bzip <dig> is an immediate downstream component of the ire arm of the upr, and its transcript has been shown to serve as an ire substrate  <cit> . a search of eggnog v <dig>  for the atbzip <dig> sequence against the soybean genome identified just one soybean ortholog, glyma.02g <dig> , which was placed into the eunog <dig> group with significant protein similarity to the atbzip <dig> prototype . phylogenetic analysis of soybean and arabidopsis orthologs of the upr membrane-tethered bzip transfactors belonging to the virnog <dig> and virnog <dig> groups confirmed that gmbzip <dig> was the most closely related to atbzip <dig> because they were clustered together and separate from the virnog <dig> group of orthologs . consistent with a duplication event, soybean gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> were clustered together as paralogs, but they were more closely related to atbzip <dig>  confirming the eggnog data . predicted protein similarities between soybean and rice bzip28/17-like genes were also determined . the orthologous genes in soybean that were the most similar to bzip <dig> were also the best matches in rice. the conservation of homologs of these bzip17-like genes in other species is strongly suggestive of their functional importance and identities.

recently, an er stress-induced plant-specific nac tf, nac <dig> , has been shown to be regulated by a functional bzip <dig> through the newly identified upre-iii  on the nac <dig> promoter  <cit> . nac <dig> in turn amplifies the upr signal by up-regulating er stress-induced promoters, such as cnx and crt. using the nac <dig> amino acid sequence as a template, we identified four orthologs in the soybean genome . eggnog v <dig>  software grouped the nac <dig> paralogs anac <dig> and anac <dig> together with the soybean orthologs glyma.04g <dig>  glyma.05g <dig>  glyma.08g <dig> and glyma.06g <dig> in the virnog <dig> group . among them, the glyma.04g <dig> predicted protein, also designated as gmnac <dig>  displayed the highest sequence similarity to nac <dig>  whereas glyma.05g <dig> , glyma.08g <dig>  and glyma.06g <dig>  were more similar to anac <dig>  as stress-responsive genes, gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> have been shown to be up-regulated by moderate water deficit, whereas gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> are up-regulated by persistent water deficit conditions  <cit> . the deduced protein sequences of all four nac <dig> orthologs from soybean were found to contain a highly conserved nac domain at the n-terminus that was divided into five nac subdomains  of conserved blocks. the presence of an er stress-responsive element controlled by bzip <dig>  pupre-iii, was identified on the gmnac <dig> promoter.

the bzip- and ire-mediated arms of the plant upr are functionally conserved in soybean
the atbzip <dig> and atbzip <dig> tfs are proteolytically activated by inducers of er stress, such as tunicamycin and dtt, and by adverse environmental conditions, such as heat and salinity  <cit> . as a consequence, the bzip domain is released from the membrane and enters into the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of upr-responsive genes controlled by perse -, pupre -, pupre-i -, pupre-ii - and/or pupre-iii -containing promoters  <cit> .

the functions of soybean gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> as bzip17/28-like upr transducers were examined using several different approaches. we first analyzed the expression profiles of gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> in response to stress conditions known to promote accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er and to induce atbzip17/ <dig> expression, such as er stress and salt stress. the treatment of soybean seedlings with the salt stress inducer nacl and the er stress inducer tunicamycin  induced accumulation of the gmbzip <dig>  and gmbzip <dig> transcripts with similar kinetics . controls for the effectiveness of the salt and er stress treatments, such as gmnac <dig>  <cit>  and bip   <cit> , were also included in the assay . gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> display patterns of expression similar to those of atbzip <dig> and atbzip <dig> fig.  <dig> expression analysis of bzip <dig> and bzip <dig>  total rna was isolated from soybean seedlings treated with nacl  and tunicamycin  for the indicated times, and the transcript levels of selected genes  were quantified by real-time pcr using gene-specific primers. gene expression was calculated using the 2−Δct method, with helicase as an endogenous control. the error bars indicate 95 % confidence intervals based on t-tests 



to further examine whether gmzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> function in the soybean upr, we searched for bzip17/ <dig> functional domains in the predicted primary structures of gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig>  several conserved motifs were found in the gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> sequences at corresponding positions in the atzip orthologs . these motifs included a bzip domain at the n-terminal cytosolic-facing region of the predicted proteins, followed by a transmembrane segment and a canonical s1p site   <cit>  at the luminal c-terminus . based on the mechanistic model of bzip <dig> activation and the conserved motifs present in gmzips, one may predict that the proteolytic release of gmzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> from the er membrane would render the nuclear-localized bzip domain functional for regulation of er stress-induced promoters. to clarify this process, we prepared truncated versions of gmbzip <dig>  and gmbzip <dig>  harboring an n-terminal bzip domain without the transmembrane segment that was fused to yfp, under the control of the 35s promoter . the truncated yfp-bzip381–434- and yfp-bzip371– <dig> fusion constructs co-localized with the nuclear marker atwwp <dig> fused to mcherry in the nuclei of n. tabacum epidermal cells when they were transiently co-expressed in leaves . to provide further evidence that gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> are functionally linked to the upr signaling pathway, we examined whether the truncated bzip domains directly target er stress cis-regulatory element-containing promoters. we performed β-glucuronidase  transactivation assay using the −2200pbip9-gus tobacco transgenic line stably transformed with a β-gus reporter gene under control of the soybipd promoter  <cit> . the soybipd promoter harbors repeated erses  and a upre-i , which have been previously shown to function as er stress-responsive elements  <cit> . we also assessed a control transgenic line stably transformed with a promoterless gus gene . accumulation of yfp-bzip381– <dig> and yfp-bzip371– <dig> transcripts in agroinfiltrated −2200pbip9-gus transgenic leaves and in pcambia control leaves was confirmed by qrt-pcr . the effects of promoter transactivation were assessed by measuring β-galactosidase activity , as well as by quantifying reporter gus transcript accumulation . the bzip domains bzip381– <dig> and bzip371– <dig> specifically activated the bip promoter, enhancing gus activity and inducing gus transcript accumulation in the 2200pbip9-gus transgenic leaves compared with the pcambia transgenic leaves. the infiltration of untransformed agrobacterium culture  and the expression of gfp alone in −2200pbip9-gus transgenic leaves did not result in targeting of the bip promoter. collectively, these results implicate gmbzip <dig> and gmbzip <dig> as true orthologs of arabidopsis bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> and suggest that the bzip28-mediated arm of the upr is mechanistically conserved in soybean.fig.  <dig> subcellular localizations of the truncated forms of bzip <dig>  bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> fused to yfp. n. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying the indicated dna constructs. a gmzip <dig>  b gmbzip <dig>  c gmbzip <dig>  the subcellular localizations of the fluorescent fusion proteins were monitored by confocal microscopy at 72 h post-infiltration. the co-localization of the yfp-bzip fusion proteins with the nuclear marker atwwp1-mcherry is shown in the merged image. scale bars = 10 μm

as the second arm of the plant upr signaling pathway, upon activation, the dual-functioning protein kinase/ribonuclease ire <dig> initiates transduction of the er stress signal by splicing the bzip <dig> transcript. the spliced bzip <dig> transcript encodes a truncated version of the protein that lacks a transmembrane domain and c terminus; therefore, the n-terminal bzip domain is capable of translocating to the nucleus to activate er stress-responsive genes. in arabidopsis, bzip <dig> is activated and induced by er stressors and diverse environmental stress conditions that promote accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er  <cit> . we found that the bzip <dig> ortholog from soybean, gmbzip <dig> , was also induced by the er stressor tunicamycin . to examine whether the gmbzip <dig> transcript undergoes ire1-mediated unconventional splicing, we first searched for potential hairpin-like ire1-specific sites in the gmbzip <dig> transcript using rna structure prediction software . the predicted form of the gmbzip <dig> transcript with the lowest free energy is presented in additional file  <dig>  from which we selected a pair of adjacent hairpin loops, with three conserved bases in each loop . the selected double-hairpin structure resembles the splicing site in the bzip <dig> transcript, which is specifically cleaved by ire <dig> at a conserved sequence  in each loop  <cit> . based on this bzip <dig> twin stem-loop structure with a conserved splice sequence for ire <dig> in each loop, we predicted that gmire1-mediated alternative splicing of gmzip <dig> would remove a 23-nucleotide segment from that site, causing a translational frameshift in the spliced rna to precisely delete the transmembrane domain, rendering a soluble, functional protein . to address this possibility, we designed two sets of primers that were each specific for spliced  or unspliced  gmzip <dig> mrna . primer specificity was confirmed by rt-pcr using cdna prepared from tunicamycin-treated and untreated soybean seedlings . the primers specific for unspliced bzip68u amplified fragments from both tunicamycin-treated and untreated seedling rna , whereas those for spliced bzip68s amplified a fragment from tunicamycin-treated seedling rna  but failed to amplify it from untreated seedling rna , which is consistent with an er stress-induced splicing event in the target rna. to detect the removal of the predicted 23b segment of rna , the rt-pcr products were separated with a 15 %  polyacrylamide gel, and rt-pcr was performed using the two sets of primers in the same reaction . rna from untreated soybean seedlings produced an rt-pcr product with a single band on the polyacrylamide gel , whereas that extracted from soybean seedlings treated with tunicamycin for 8 h and 24 h generated rt-pcr products with two bands, confirming the er stress-mediated splicing of gmbzip <dig>  as a positive control for the er stress-induced splicing assay, rt-pcr using tunicamycin-treated arabidopsis rna with bzip60u- and bzip60s-specific primers resulted in the expected double band on a polyacrylamide gel .fig.  <dig> expression analysis of bzip <dig>  total rna was isolated from soybean seedlings treated with tunicamycin for the indicated time, and the transcript level of the truncated form of bzip <dig> was quantified by real-time pcr using gene-specific primers. gene expression was calculated using the 2−Δct method, with helicase as an endogenous control. the error bars indicate 95 % confidence intervals based on t-tests

we also determined the transcription-regulating activity of gmbzip <dig> by performing gus transactivation assays using −2200pbip9-gus tobacco transgenic leaves. we first transiently expressed an n-terminal truncated version of gmbzip <dig>  fused to yfp by agroinfiltrating a 35s::bzip681–209-yfp construct into n. benthamiana leaves and examining its subcellular localization by confocal microscopy . as expected for a truncated bzip protein with no transmembrane segment, fluorescence of the yfp-gmbzip681– <dig> fusion protein was concentrated in the nuclei of agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves , co-localizing with the nuclear marker atwwp1-mcherry . for gus transactivation assay, agrobacterium carrying a 35s::yfp-gmbzip681– <dig> construct or a 35s::gfp negative control was infiltrated into 2200pbip9-gus transgenic leaves and pcambia transgenic leaves. expression of yfp-gmbzip681– <dig>  but not that of gfp, activated the bip promoter, as determined by increases in β-galactosidase activity  and transcript levels  in the 2200pbip9-gus transgenic leaves compared with the controls. collectively, these results indicate that gmbzip <dig> is a true ortholog of bzip <dig> from arabidopsis and that the ire-mediated splicing arm of the upr is functionally conserved in soybean.

due to the lack of antibodies against gmbzip <dig>  gmbzip <dig> and gmbip <dig>  we did not monitor the stress-induced accumulation of these upr receptors at the protein level in the homologous system. nevertheless, the fusion of gfp to truncated versions of the soybean upr transducers clearly demonstrated that their bzip domains accumulated stably in the nuclei of transfected tobacco leaves and functionally activated an erse- and upre-containing bip promoter.

analysis of upr downstream components in the soybean genome
to restore er homeostasis under stress conditions, the plant upr signaling pathway elicits the up-regulation of stress-specific responses, including increases in protein folding and degradation in the er. the protein folding capacity of the er depends on the repertoire of resident molecular chaperones, which has been extensively characterized in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, we used the known chaperones from arabidopsis as the prototypes to identify soybean orthologs though searches of eggnog. we also searched for typical domains in er-resident proteins, such as n-terminal peptide signals and c-terminal er retention signals, as additional criteria to identify soybean orthologs. high degrees of sequence identity/similarity and highly significant e-values were consistently observed between the orthologous pairs of upr downstream components.

bip, the most abundant chaperone in the er, belongs to the heat shock protein 70 kda  family and has been extensively characterized in different plant species, such as tobacco, soybean and arabidopsis . in addition to its molecular chaperone activity, plant bip also functions in regulating signaling events related to er stress, and it displays protective functions under distinct stress conditions, including the attenuation of er stress  <cit> , the promotion of drought tolerance in transgenic soybean  and tobacco  plants  <cit> , the activation of plant innate immunity  <cit>  and the attenuation er stress- and osmotic stress-induced cell death in soybean  <cit> . in general, plant bip is represented by multiple copies . a search of eggnog v <dig>  using atbip <dig> as the prototype resulted in the placement of bip <dig> and bip <dig> from arabidopsis into the virnog <dig> group together with the previously described soybean bips  and a new additional soybean bip, gene model glyma.05g <dig> . atbip <dig> was grouped separately as a virnog <dig> representative, with no closely related homolog in soybean. phylogenetic analysis of hsp <dig> members from arabidopsis and soybean revealed that the bip proteins were clustered together in a distinct clade, with atbip <dig> placed separate from the others, representing the most distant member of the family .

calnexin  and calreticulin  represent the major protein folding machinery of the er, and they specifically bind glycoproteins that carry monoglucosylated n-linked glycans  <cit> . calreticulin is a soluble protein in the er lumen, whereas calnexin is a type  <dig> membrane protein. in arabidopsis, three crt isoforms and two cnx isoforms have been described  <cit> . a search of eggnog for the at1g <dig>  protein sequence against the soybean genome resulted in the clustering of four soybean crt paralogs into the virnog <dig> group. the other two arabidopsis crts  were placed into the virnog <dig> group, together with two soybean crt orthologs . the confidence index e-value revealed high conservation of homologous regions between orthologous pairs.

the a. thaliana cnx genes were recovered and clustered into five different groups , which included  <dig> arabidopsis genes and  <dig> soybean orthologs . the largest group, virnog <dig>  contained the most well-characterized arabidopsis cnx gene, cnx <dig> , and four soybean orthologs. all members of the cnx family displayed remarkably conserved primary structures and the conserved domains of er-resident proteins. as er-resident molecular chaperones, both calreticulin and calnexin from soybean are induced by er stressors, such as tunicamycin and azc.

er-resident protein disulfide isomerases , which are associated with the cnx/crt system, catalyze disulfide bond formation, which plays relevant roles in the folding and stabilization of tertiary and quaternary protein structures  <cit> . pdis are multi-domain proteins that belong to the thioredoxin  superfamily and hence harbor at least one trx domain. the arabidopsis genome encodes  <dig> pdis, but only  <dig> possess known er retention signals and have been implicated in protein folding  <cit> . in the soybean genome,  <dig> pdi paralogs have been previously identified  <cit> . our analysis did not result in the selection of the gene model glyma12g <dig>  as a pdi; instead, glyma.14g <dig>  was included as a new additional pdi paralog in soybean .

the arabidopsis pdi paralogs at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at4g <dig> do not have known er retention signals  <cit> . at2g <dig> and four highly conserved soybean orthologs  were clustered into the virnog <dig> group. the other two pdi paralogs lacking known er retention signals, at3g <dig> and at4g <dig>  were placed with three soybean orthologs into the virnog <dig> group. the members of this latter group displayed high degrees of sequence conservation with more than 85 % similarity, 71 % identity, 97 % coverage and significant e-values. the soybean pdi orthologs also did not harbor known er retention signals.

the remaining arabidopsis pdis with er retention signals and  <dig> soybean orthologs were distributed into seven distinct eggnog v <dig> -generated groups that were significantly conserved . phylogenetic analysis results recapitulated the eggnog data . pin <dig>  erdj and grp <dig> orthologs are also represented in the soybean genome by small gene families .

we also identified predicted soybean orthologs involved in glycoprotein folding, such as oligosaccharyltransferase , glucosidase i , glucosidase ii  and udp-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase , using the arabidopsis homologs as prototypes   <cit> . remarkable sequence conservation among all orthologs in this category was supported by their significant e-values, and their high levels of similarity and identity suggest that they are functional analogs.

we also examined the components of erad in the soybean genome as downstream components of the upr. the degradation of unfolded proteins by the erad system is crucial for the re-establishment of er homeostasis under stress conditions and involves the following four steps:  recognition,  ubiquitination,  retrotranslocation and  protein degradation  <cit> . in yeast and mammals, the erad pathway has been intensively characterized, and this information has been used to identify orthologs in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the profile of plant erad components was extended in this current investigation to include predicted orthologs in soybean. usa1-like, cue1-like and otu1-like proteins were not found in arabidopsis or soybean. hrd3b–like, pux6-like, pux <dig>  pux <dig>  pux <dig> and pux <dig> proteins were not detected in the soybean genome. all other erad components were represented by at least two related copies in the soybean genome . in general, sequence comparison analyses revealed that the predicted erad-associated orthologous pairs in arabidopsis and soybean shared significant amino acid sequence conservation .

recently the n-glycan erad pathway, which monitors the correct glycosylation of proteins and targets improperly folded glycoproteins for degradation, has been shown to be highly conserved in plants . terminally unfolded glycoproteins are removed from the cnx/crt folding system through the sequential hydrolysis of two α <dig> -mannose residues, as mediated by the er-resident α <dig> -mannosidase mns <dig> in arabidopsis  and mns4/mns <dig>  which corresponds to homologous to mannosidase  <dig>  in yeast, er-degradation enhancing a-mannosidase-like protein  in mammals and three predicted orthologs in soybean . the removal of the α <dig> -mannose residue exposes a α <dig> -mannose residue, which is a targeting signal for the er-resident lectins ebs <dig>  and ebs5/hrd3a  in yeast and suppressor of lin-12-like  in mammals)  <cit> . ebs <dig> and ebs <dig> recruit and targets unfolded proteins to the er membrane-tethered erad complex for ubiquitination and retrotranslocation. the arabidopsis genome has two hrd3/sel1l homologs, designated as atsel1a  and atsel1b , and an os9/yos <dig> homolog, atos <dig> , whereas in the soybean genome, two representatives in each class with significant sequence identities to their arabidopsis counterparts were identified .

the central component of the erad complex is a cytosolic-facing er membrane-associated e <dig> ring finger-type ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitination of erad substrates and for connection of a series of luminal and cytosolic adapters  <cit> . the hmg-coa reductase degradation  protein is specific for erad l/m substrates  and degradation of alpha <dig>  erad c substrates . the arabidopsis genome encodes two hrd <dig> orthologs   <cit>  and two doa <dig> orthologs   <cit> . likewise, in the soybean genome, we identified two copies with significant similarities to hrd <dig> and doa <dig>  respectively . in yeast, hrd <dig> e <dig> ligase-associated proteins include cue <dig> , ubc <dig> , u1-snp <dig> associating- <dig>  and degradation in the er . the proteins cue <dig> and ubc <dig> are also contained in the doa e <dig> ligase complex. in arabidopsis, three ubc <dig>  homologs are associated with doa <dig>  <cit> , whereas in the soybean genome, ubc <dig> is represented by two copies and ubc <dig> by two copies. ubc <dig>  is induced by salt, drought and er stress  <cit> . neither the arabidopsis nor the soybean genome encodes the usa <dig> or cue <dig> gene, but they contain three and four der <dig> homologs, respectively .

ubiquitinated erad substrates are extracted from the er lumen  or from the er membrane  by a trimeric complex of the homohexameric proteins cdc <dig> , ufd <dig> and npl <dig>   <cit> . the cdc48/ufd1/npl <dig> complex is recruited by the e <dig> hrd1/doa <dig> e <dig> complex through ubx <dig> . the resulting polyubiquitinated erad substrates are further processed through antagonistic interactions between ufd <dig>  and ufd <dig>  in addition to otu <dig>  and/or by png <dig> peptide -mediated deglycosylation  <cit> . processed erad substrates are directed to the 26s proteasome by cdc <dig> and two ubiquitin receptors, rad <dig> and dsk <dig>  for degradation. the arabidopsis genome encodes three cdc <dig> homologs   <cit> , whereas in the soybean genome, there are  <dig> predicted proteins with significant similarity to cdc <dig> . atcdc <dig> is recruited to the er membrane by ubx domain-containing proteins, which are represented by  <dig> copies  in the arabidopsis genome and interact with atcdc48a  <cit> . a total of  <dig> pux homologs were identified in the soybean genome . while ufd <dig>  ufd <dig>  ufd <dig>  npl <dig>  rad <dig>  and dsk <dig> are encoded by gene families in arabidopsis and soybean, png is a single-copy gene in the arabidopsis genome and is represented by two copies in the soybean genome  <cit> . the high levels of conservation of primary sequences and domain structures among the erad components from yeast, mammals and two plant species, along with the findings of functional studies of arabidopsis  and expression analyses of soybean and arabidopsis that have been conducted, support the notion that the erad system functions in plants in a similar manner as in mammals and yeast.

identification of er stress-induced plasma membrane-associated nac <dig> homologs in the soybean genome
recently, a plasma membrane-tethered member of the nac family, nac <dig>  has been shown to integrate upr signaling through an as-yet-unknown mechanism. er stress causes the release of the nac domain from the plasma membrane and its relocation to the nucleus to regulate er stress-responsive genes  <cit> . nac <dig> expression is controlled by bzip <dig>  using eggnog v <dig>  software, gmnac <dig> was determined to be a member of the virnog <dig> group, which is comprised of three genes, anac <dig>  cbnac and anac <dig>  in addition to three predicted soybean orthologs, gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> . in addition to displaying significant amino acid sequence similarity, as determined by comparing orthologous pairs, the nac <dig> orthologs possess a predicted transmembrane segment and an n-terminal peptide signal that may target them to the plasma membrane. the promoters of the three soybean ortholog genes gmnac <dig>  gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> harbor a upr cis-regulatory element, pupre-iii , which is a bzip <dig> binding site  <cit> .

plant-specific er stress-induced cell death responses may be conserved in soybean and arabidopsis
another plant-specific nac domain-containing tf, gmnac <dig>  which is an er membrane-associated protein, has been shown to play a relevant role in the er stress response by positively regulating er stress-induced pcd  <cit> . er stress causes relocation of gmnac <dig> from the er membrane to the nucleus, where it induces the expression of pcd-associated genes. a search of eggnog for gmnac <dig> against the soybean genome did not identify any soybean orthologs. two predicted soybean orthologs, gmnac <dig>  <cit>  and an as-yet-unclassified soybean nac gene , were identified using blastp. this novel full-length nac predicted protein was recovered from the recently released version of the revised soybean genome, glycine max wm <dig> a <dig> v <dig>  suggesting the existence of two homologous copies of nac <dig> in the soybean genome. these soybean orthologs harbor a predicted transmembrane segment and an n-terminal peptide signal that may target them to the er membrane .

the er stress- and osmotic stress-induced nrp/dcd-mediated cell death cooperative response, which has been described in soybean, may be the most well-characterized plant-specific er stress-induced pcd signaling response . consequently, we used soybean genes as prototypes to identify orthologs in arabidopsis. the gmerd <dig>  tf is the most upstream component characterized, and it is induced by osmotic and er stress to trigger the expression of nrp/dcd genes. a search of eggnog recovered two paralogs in the soybean genome clustered in the virnog <dig> group and no ortholog in the arabidopsis genome .

a search of eggnog for the dcd/nrp-a sequence identified two paralogous copies each of dcd/nrp-a and dcd/nrp-b and a single-copy gene, atnrp1/at5g <dig>  in the arabidopsis genome, with significant amino acid sequence similarities . these genes were clustered into the virnog <dig> group separately from two soybean paralogs and an arabidopsis ortholog  of dcd/nrp-c, which were placed into the virnog <dig> group. phylogenetic analysis confirmed the separation of dcd/nrp-c from the dcd/nrp-a-dcd/nrp-b cluster . although dcd/nrp-a and dcd/nrp-b have redundant and relevant functions in cell death signaling, it remains to be determined whether dcd/nrp-c also functions in the transduction pathway. the high degree of sequence conservation among nrp orthologs from three plant species  may also implicate functional conservation. consistent with this hypothesis, atnrp <dig> and atnrp <dig> display similar expression profiles and subcellular localizations as the soybean orthologs  <cit> .

the execution of the cell death program has been proposed to occur through nrp-mediated induction of the gmnac081-gmnac030-vpe module  <cit> . gmnac <dig> and its paralog were placed into the virnog <dig> group together with an arabidopsis ortholog . in contrast, gmnac <dig> was found to be represented by a small multigene family, with seven copies in the soybean genome, which were placed together with the arabidopsis ortholog anac002/ataf <dig>  into the virnog <dig> group. phylogenetic analysis based on the nac sequences involved in upr signaling and the er stress cell death response confirmed the eggnog data, further supporting the notion that the er stress-induced nac orthologs share conserved unique functions in the plant er-stress response .

the vpe family has five representatives in the soybean genome  <cit> . a search of eggnog for the glyma.14g <dig> sequence against the arabidopsis and soybean genomes recovered and resulted in the grouping together of four soybean paralogs and two arabidopsis orthologs  into the virnog <dig> group. these data were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, which revealed that the four soybean vpes and alphavpe and gammavpe from arabidopsis formed a unique clade that was separated from the fifth soybean vpe, glyma01g <dig> . the four most closely related soybean vpes display similar expression profiles during development and in response to stress  <cit> . the expression profiles and functions of more distantly related vpes have not been examined. the high conservation of the components of the er stress nrp-mediated cell death response between soybean and arabidopsis suggests that this cell death signaling response may be a general er stress response in plants rather a specific transduction pathway in soybean.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the relevance of the er as a key organelle involved in stress adaptive responses, genes involved in the er stress response in soybean have not been examined to date. here, we present a complete repertoire of the potential players in the soybean er stress response, generating a comprehensive panel as a framework for functional predictions.

as the major result of our research, a complete scenario of the er stress response in soybean is presented in fig.  <dig>  an interactive map of this comprehensive panel of the er stress response is also available at the address http://inctipp.bioagro.ufv.br/upr/. this tool enables the access of detailed information about the protein families in the soybean database by clicking on the representative gene in the panel. in fig.  <dig> and in its online version, the normal pathway of secretory proteins as they enter the er lumen and proceed towards the golgi is depicted in numbers  <dig> through  <dig>  disruption of proper folding results in deviation from this route  to a protein degradation pathway, shown in numbers  <dig> through  <dig>  accumulation of unfolded proteins activates upr signaling, which functions as a bipartite module. the atf6-like-mediated arm of the upr can be followed in numbers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas the ire1-like-mediated arm is presented as route  <dig>  plant-specific cross-talk between er stress response pathways and plasma membrane-associated proteins is presented as route  <dig>  we also identified representatives of the plant-specific er stress-induced cell death response in the soybean genome. in route  <dig>  transduction of an er stress-induced signal starts with the predicted regulated intramembrane proteolysis of a membrane-tethered nac domain-containing tf. the mechanism of execution of the cell death program is lacking, with the exception of the observation that the released nac tf up-regulates cell death-associated genes. the er stress- and osmotic stress-induced cell death response is initiated in number  <dig> and culminates with activation of the expression of vpe , which is an executioner of plant-specific vacuole collapse-mediated pcd. in soybean, similar to other eukaryotic organisms, er stress triggers the evolutionarily conservative upr and also accommodates cross-talk with several other adaptive signaling responses, such as osmotic-stress induced cell death and er stress-induced pcd.fig.  <dig> comprehensive panel of the er stress response in soybean. to enter the er lumen, secretory proteins are translated by er-associated polysomes, and the nascent secretory peptide is co-translationally transported to the er through the sec <dig> translocation complex . in the er, the pre-assembly oligosaccharide core  is transferred  from the er-localized dolichyl pyrophosphate  to the nascent polypeptide by oligosaccharyltransferase . processing or trimming of the n-glycan begins in the er with the sequential removal of the more external glucose residues by glucosidase i  and glucosidase ii . the monoglycosylated glucan-peptide is targeted to the calnexin/calreticulin system containing the protein disulfide isomerase  accessory protein for proper folding . folded proteins are released from this n-glycan-dependent quality control mechanism through hydrolysis of the third glucose residue by gluii. properly folded proteins leave the er. unfolded proteins may be re-glycosylated by udp-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase  to re-enter the cnx/crt-mediated folding cycle . the removal of glucose residues and transient re-addition of the innermost glucose during protein folding contribute to the er retention time of a given glycoprotein. failure to achieve the proper conformation within a defined period of time is a signal for exclusion of the glycoprotein from the cnx/crt folding cycle by the sequential removal of two α <dig> -mannose residues by mns <dig> and mns4/mns <dig> . the removal of these residues exposes an α <dig> -mannose, which targets the glycoprotein to the erad pathway. ebs <dig> and ebs <dig> recruit unfolded glycoproteins to redirect them to the membrane-associated erad complex for ubiquitination and retrotranslocation to the cytosol, where they are targeted to the proteasome . ubiquitinated erad substrates are directed from the er to the proteasome via the trimeric complex cdc48/ufd1/npl <dig> . er stress induces the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen and activates the upr pathway . bip-mediated dissociation 0of the upr transducers gmbzip37/ <dig>   allows for the mobilization of these receptors to the golgi , where they are proteolytically cleaved by s1p and s2p , releasing the n-terminal bzip domains as functional tfs that are then translocated to the nucleus , where they activate er stress-responsive promoters . in the other arm of the upr , under er stress, gmire <dig> dimerizes to activate its ribonuclease activity, which promotes unconventional splicing of the gmbzip <dig>  mrna, generating an active tf  lacking the transmembrane segment. gmbzip68s  moves to the nucleus to induce the expression of molecular chaperones, erad components, gmbzip <dig> , gmnac <dig>  and gmnac <dig> . evidence indicates that gmbzip37/ <dig> and gmbzip68s may act in concert as heterodimers to activate er stress-responsive genes. gmbzip68s  also induces expression of the tf gmnac <dig>  to further amplify the er stress response . as a plasma membrane component of the er stress response , membrane-tethered gmnac <dig>  also undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis  for release into the nucleus as a positive regulator of er stress-responsive genes. if the upr is not capable of restoring er homeostasis under prolonged and severe stress, then pcd responses are activated for the regulated disposal of abnormal cells. er stress-induced proteolysis of er membrane-tethered gmnac <dig>  exemplifies an er stress-induced plant-specific pcd response . rip-mediated translocation of gmnac <dig> to the nucleus allows for the induction of pcd-associated gene expression, promoting dna fragmentation and an increase in caspase-3/7-like activity. a distinct er stress-induced pcd response in soybean integrates an osmotic stress signal into a full response . the combination of er stress and osmotic stress fully induces the expression of the tf gmerd <dig>  to activate the expression of the membrane-associated protein dcd/nrp-b . induction of dcd/nrp-b activates a signaling cascade that culminates with the induction of the gmnac <dig> and gmnac <dig> tfs , which form heterodimers to fully transactivate the vacuolar processing enzyme  promoter . vpe exhibits caspase-1-like activity and induces plant-specific pcd, mediated by collapse of the vacuole 



we provided several lines of evidence that the soybean and arabidopsis er stress responses operate similarly. first, in addition to the high conservation of the primary structures of the soybean and arabidopsis putative orthologs, they share common functional and localization domains that may be associated with their shared biochemical activities and subcellular localizations. second, both arms of the upr were further examined functionally, and evidence is presented that the soybean counterparts are true orthologs of previously characterized upr transducers in arabidopsis. the bzip17/bzi <dig> orthologs  and zip <dig> ortholog  from soybean are induced by er stress and activate an erse- and upre-containing bip promoter. furthermore, the transcript of the putative substrate of gmires, gmbzip <dig>  harbors a canonical site for ire <dig> endonuclease activity and is efficiently spliced under er stress conditions, generating a truncated version of the protein that lacks the transmembrane segment and includes a second nuclear localization signal. these expression and functional analyses of bzip <dig>  bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> support the notion that the bipartite module of the plant upr is functionally conserved in soybean. finally, in a reverse approach, we showed that the er stress-induced dcd/nrp-mediated pcd response, which has been previously characterized in soybean, is also conserved in arabidopsisand in rice. the components of this er stress-induced cell death signaling pathway are also induced by other biotic and abiotic signals, such drought, salt and pathogen incompatible interactions  <cit> . therefore, activation of the nrp-mediated pcd response is not specific to er stress; rather, it is a shared branch of general environmental adaptive pathways.
