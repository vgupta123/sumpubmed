BACKGROUND
transition metals such as iron and zinc are key factors in numerous biological processes as both, structural and catalytic cofactors for proteins. therefore, they are important for the metabolic homeostasis and viability of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells  <cit> . however, high intracellular amounts of free iron and zinc also bear a great toxic potential. consequently, cells have established sensitively regulated processes for maintaining a balanced intracellular metal homeostasis.

in mycobacteria, several importer, exporter and scavenger proteins as well as different regulator proteins have been described to contribute to metal homeostasis  <cit> . the most important regulator of iron homeostasis in mycobacteria is the iron dependent repressor protein ider, a metal binding transcriptional regulator of the diptheria-toxin repressor  family  <cit> . ider is a regulator with complex functions, on the one hand acting as a repressor of mycobactin synthesis and iron siderophore uptake transporters  <cit>  and on the other hand it activates the synthesis of iron storage proteins. in addition, ider is involved in virulence and in the regulation of stress response and central metabolism  <cit> . the role of another regulator, the staphylococcal iron regulator repressor sirr in mycobacterial iron metabolism has been suggested, but has not been confirmed yet  <cit> .

the maintenance of zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria is regulated by the metalloregulator system smtb-furb. both regulators are co-transcribed from one operon, but work antagonistically. smtb is a metal sensor of the arsr-family, which senses free zinc ions and regulates the majority of zinc export systems  <cit> , whereas the fur family protein furb, also known as zur, is a zinc dependent repressor of zinc uptake systems .

mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis  is the causative agent of paratuberculosis , a chronic, incurable enteritis in ruminants. map belongs to the m. avium complex . the mac comprises genetically closely related subspecies with different extents of environmental adaptation and virulence. for instance, the mac ancestral m. avium ssp. hominissuis  retained genes for environmental lifestyle, but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans, pigs and ruminants  <cit> 
. in contrast, map, as an obligatory pathogen, is unable to multiply in the environment  <cit>  and needs the host for multiplication. hence, map developed a particular tropism to the intestine  <cit> , characterized by strong metabolic adaptations  <cit> , allowing massive map proliferation in the host at late stages of disease. the phenotypical differences in the mac are associated with irreversible insertions and deletions of genomic fragments, so called large sequence polymorphisms   <cit> . thus, the map genome comprises seven exclusive lineage specific genomic insertions  and one deletion . interestingly, several genes located on these lsps have recently been found to be associated with virulence  <cit> .

a common feature of the pathogenicity of map and other pathogenic mycobacteria is the ability to persist intracellularly in macrophages by inhibiting the phagosomal maturation  <cit> , thereby evading or contemporarily modulating host cell defence mechanisms . additionally, mycobacteria are able to overcome the so called nutritional immunity, a process induced by host cells and characterized by microbial nutrient starvation or intoxication . thus, macrophages are able to deplete essential iron ions by secreting scavenging chelating compounds such as haem, lactoferrin and ferritin. furthermore, they are able to create an iron depleted environment in the phagosome by the activity of the natural resistance associated membrane protein  transporter  <cit> . most pathogenic mycobacteria are able to counteract iron starvation by the inducible expression of the iron chelating siderophores mycobactin and carboxymycobactin, the expression of which is controlled by ider  <cit> .

map is unable to produce functional mycobactins. even though the gene cluster for mycobactin synthesis is present in the genome, the genes mbta and mbte are truncated  <cit>  which disturbs mycobactin production. hence, map requires substituting systems. the mycobacterium paratuberculosis transporter gene cluster  is a promising candidate as it is predicted to encode two putative transporters  involved in metal transport  <cit> . it is located on the map specific lsp <dig> along with two clusters encoding a putative siderophore synthesis system  and a putative siderophore uptake system . in addition, the mptabc operon shows homologies to the iron uptake transporter irtab of m. tuberculosis   <cit> . in mtb, irtab was shown to contribute to virulence and maintenance of iron homeostasis by mediating mycobactin uptake  <cit> .

despite the need of map for an iron substituting system, the function and the regulation of the genes of lsp <dig> and lsp <dig> is unclear. regulation by ider is unlikely as no binding site for this regulator could be found in the promoter region  <cit> . furthermore, the ferric uptake regulator fura has recently been shown to be not involved in the regulation of the genes of lsp <dig> and lsp <dig> .

since the maintenance of metal homeostasis is crucial for survival of map in the host, we were interested to elucidate the role of lsp <dig> and lsp <dig> in metal homeostasis. in the presented work, we found that the mptabc transporter is regulated by zinc and that the transcriptional regulator furb is directly involved in the zinc dependent regulation of mptabc. furthermore, we analysed the global response of map to zinc starvation and were able to identify a unique zinc responsive genomic island in map.

RESULTS
metal dependent regulation of a map specific genome region
the map specific lsp <dig> and lsp <dig> harbour many genes proposed to be involved in metal homeostasis  <cit> . amongst these map3736c-3734c  encode for an irtab like transporter  <cit> , the gene cluster map3739c- <dig>  for a siderophore synthesis system and map3726- <dig>  for another predicted siderophore uptake system. therefore, we were interested whether these genes were regulated metal dependently. to investigate this, we exposed map to different metal starvation conditions and analysed changes in gene expression by qrt-pcr. iron starvation was achieved by addition of the cell membrane permeable iron chelator  <dig> -bipyridyl , thereby depleting intracellular fe2+ ions. in these experiments, the mbtb gene  of the mycobactin cluster, which is known to be induced by iron starvation in mtb and map  <cit> , was included as positive control.

as shown in figure 1a, compared to the untreated control, expression of mbtb was significantly induced upon dip treatment , indicating successful iron chelation. expression of mpta and sida, representing the mptabc and sid-operon, respectively, was also enhanced after dip treatment, however, to a considerably lower extent than mbtb. to dissect whether this induction was due to iron starvation or dip chelation of other metal ions, we analysed the expression of these genes in cultures treated with nitrilotriacetic acid  at a final concentration of 14 mm. nta is a less selective non permeable chelator which binds fe3+ and many other metal ions. as shown in figure 1b, treatment of map cultures with nta, even over extended time, did not affect mbtb expression, whereas mpta and sida were still induced. the fep cluster responded neither to dip nor to nta treatment . these results suggested that metal ions other than iron are involved in the regulation of the mptabc and sid-operon.figure  <dig>

specific gene locus. mapwt was grown in mb-complete to an od <dig> of  <dig>  and treated with different chelating agents and supplements as described in methods. after rna extraction, changes in gene expression levels of mbtb , mpta  and sida  were analysed by qrt-pcr.  200 μm  <dig> -bipyridyl  for 2 h.  14 mm nitrilotriacetic acid  for 24 h.  nta treated cultures  supplemented with 1 mm znso <dig>  feso <dig>  mgcl <dig>  cacl <dig>  cuso <dig>  cocl <dig> or mnso <dig>   10 μm n,n,n′,n′-tetrakis  ethylenediamine  for 2 h.  tpen treated cultures  supplemented with znso <dig> or feso <dig> both in a final concentration of  <dig>  μm. shown are the results of at least three independent experiments . results were normalized to the housekeeping gene gap and are expressed as fold change compared to the untreated controls. statistical analyses were performed using kruskal-wallis test  with *p <  <dig>  and ***p <  <dig>  or mann–whitney test  with ***p <  <dig> .



to evaluate this, we supplemented nta cultures  with znso <dig>  feso <dig>  mgcl <dig>  cacl <dig>  cuso <dig>  cocl <dig> or mnso <dig> each to a final concentration of 1 mm  <cit> . compared to cultures treated with nta only, induction of mpta  and sida  were significantly repressed only upon supplementation with znso <dig>  indicating a zinc dependent regulation of the mptabc and sid-operon. the specificity of a zinc dependent regulation was further investigated by exposure of map cultures to 10 μm n,n,n′,n′-tetrakis  ethylenediamine , a cell permeable chelating agent, which specifically binds intracellular zinc with high affinity. as expected, tpen treatment resulted in a significant induction of mpta and sida, whereas expression of mbtb was only very slightly affected . vice versa, supplementation of tpen treated cultures  with znso <dig> but not feso <dig>  completely abolished mpta induction . in fact, titration experiments for the determination of the optimal concentration showed that the addition of 1 μm znso <dig>  was already sufficient to reduce induction of mpta to approx. 50%, which emphasizes the high sensitivity of the regulation of mpta by zinc . together these results demonstrated the zinc dependent regulation of the mptabc- and sid-operon.

a functional furb binding site is necessary for mptabc operon expression
next, we were interested to elucidate the mechanisms of zinc dependent regulation of the mptabc operon. first, we determined the transcriptional start site  of mpta by 5’race from tpen treated cultures and defined the promoter-operator elements as shown in figure 2a. the tss was located at nucleotide  <dig>  and a putative translation start  codon  of mpta was found +56 bp downstream , preceded by a putative ribosome binding site  gaaggattgag . a putative − <dig> promoter element  could be identified −8 bp from the tss . furthermore, we could identify three sequence motifs in the 5’ proximal promoter-operator region with high homology to the binding site of the zinc dependent metalloregulator furb  of mtb  <cit> , hereafter designated as zur box 1– <dig> figure  <dig>

following, we tested the ability of mycobacterium smegmatis  to serve as a heterologous expression system by transforming msmeg with the plasmid pmp <dig>  <cit> , harbouring the complete mpt cluster and 941 bp upstream the tss of mpta. then, cultures were left untreated or treated with tpen at a final concentration of 10 μm and expression of mpta was analysed by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure 2b, we observed a clear induction of expression upon zinc starvation compared to the untreated control. this indicated that the regulation of mptabc in msmeg was similar to that in map, thereby demonstrating the suitability of the system. to elucidate the relevance of the zur boxes we cloned 984 bp from − <dig> to + <dig> relative to the tss of mpta, harbouring all three putative zur boxes but lacking the rbs, into the lacz-reporter plasmid pjem <dig>  next, we introduced the resulting plasmid pjem-mpta <dig> and the promoter-less pjem <dig> vector into msmeg and analysed β-galactosidase activity of untreated or tpen treated cultures. as shown in figure 2d, without tpen treatment, both msmeg transformants showed only low β-galactosidase activity similar to the insert-free pjem <dig> transformant. treatment with tpen significantly increased β-galactosidase activity of msmeg transformed with pjem-mpta <dig>  deletion of the two proximal zur boxes  abolished tpen induced reporter activity, suggesting that additional upstream promoter elements are necessary for full mpta regulation. on the other hand, deletion of the putative promoter elements including zur box <dig>  resulted in a complete loss of repression. to dissect the relevance of zur box <dig>  we generated pjem-mpta2mut with two point mutations in zur box <dig> . by site directed mutagenesis we exchanged nucleotides g→t and c→g at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in pjem-mpta <dig> . these mutations resulted in a complete loss of mpta repression , clearly showing a direct involvement of zur box <dig> in regulation of the mptabc operon.

the mptabc operon of map is regulated by furb
the above analysis suggested that zur box <dig> mediated furb repression of mpta. comparison of amino acid sequences of furb of map  and msmeg  to mtb  by blastp and clustal omega analyses revealed high homologies of 90% and 80%, respectively, indicating a strong conservation within mycobacterial furb proteins. moreover, all catalytic and structural important amino acids  <cit>  were highly conserved among the species .figure  <dig>

to prove furb as the responsible regulator of mpta, we deleted furb  in msmeg and transformed the resulting mutant msmeg∆furb with pmp <dig>  harbouring the complete mpt cluster and the 5’utr of mpta. qrt-pcr analyses revealed that the expression level of mpta in msmeg∆furb was significantly higher compared to msmegwt at standard culture conditions , suggesting a loss of repression by furb. in addition, analysis of β-galactosidase activity in msmeg∆furb transformed with pjem-mpta <dig>  harbouring the functional zur box <dig>  showed a complete derepression of promoter activity . addition of tpen did not increase mpta promoter activity in the β-galactosidase assay  or gene expression in the msmeg∆furb pmp <dig> transformant, analysed by qrt-pcr . thus, these data strongly suggest a furb-dependent regulation of the mptabc operon in map.

transcriptional response of map to zinc starvation
since the mptabc and sid operons are part of the map specific genomic insertion lsp <dig>  we were interested to investigate the overall response of genes of this and other lsps to zinc starvation. for this purpose, we performed rna deep sequencing of rna from untreated and tpen treated map cultures and dissected differential gene expression by rockhopper analysis . in total,  <dig> genes were found to be at least >3-fold differentially expressed in the tpen culture compared to the untreated control .table  <dig>

apart from putative zur-regulated genes, we also found a number of zinc dependent but zur-independent genes, either distributed over the genome  or located on the 90 kb gene locus .

to proof the significance of the zinc responsive gene clustering on the zngi in map, a monte-carlo simulation of non-random gene distribution was performed. in  <dig> % of the simulated data sets, four or five zinc responsive genes out of  <dig> randomly distributed ones were found to be clustered within  <dig> genes. the largest cluster consisting of nine zinc responsive genes was found in one data set only. based on these results, the probability that  <dig> out of  <dig> zinc responsive genes are located in a region of  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes by chance is p <  <dig> *10− <dig> 

finally we analysed the genomic distribution of homologues to zinc responsive genes of map and additional zur dependent genes of mtb in other mycobacteria species  . interestingly, in contrast to map, we found no evidence for a locus specific clustering of these genes in the other mycobacterial species, demonstrating the specificity of the zngi for map.

discussion
in contrast to other mycobacteria, map exhibits a strong tropism to the gut, but the molecular mechanisms which enable map to fill this niche are only poorly understood. the lineage specific genomic insertions lsp <dig> and lsp <dig>  unique to map and acquired during evolution, are suggested to be involved in metal homeostasis and have been found to be associated with virulence . since acquisition of metals is a crucial pathomechanism, in the present study we intended to analyse the metal dependent regulation of the lsp14- <dig> gene locus. initially, our particular interest was drawn to the mpt  cluster, comprised of two predicted transporters , as it might represent an alternative iron scavenging system, which possibly compensates for map defects to produce mycobactins  <cit> . in fact, mptabc was hypothesised to represent the iron regulated transporter irtab in map  <cit> . however, our starvation experiments clearly showed a sensitive regulation of the mptabc operon by zinc but not by iron.

zinc homeostasis is tightly regulated by the fur family regulator furb  in many bacteria  <cit> , as zinc starvation as well as zinc excess ultimately lead to cell death. despite this, only little is known about zinc homeostasis in mycobacteria. analyses in mtb indicated the regulation of zinc transporters and storage systems by zur  <cit> . yet, functional studies are missing so far and no research has been conducted on map.

our in silico analyses revealed that furb of msmeg, mtb and map are almost identical and share the same structural and catalytic amino acids. in addition, by fimo analyses we found a conserved homology of map zur boxes to zur boxes of mtb and other bacteria . in fact, by site directed mutagenesis, we could demonstrate the specificity of these boxes. mutation of two single, highly conserved nucleotides  in the furb binding site located in the 5’ utr of the mptabc operon  resulted in the loss of gene repression in msmeg.

using msmeg as a heterologous model, we showed a highly sensitive transcriptional response of the mptabc operon to zinc starvation. in addition, by generating a msmeg∆furb mutant, we were able to show that furb is involved in mptabc regulation. deletion of furb in msmeg led to a complete loss of mpta gene repression. this clearly demonstrated the importance of furb in mptabc regulation and implies a putative role of mptabc as zinc importer.

rnaseq allowed us to assess the global response of map to zinc limitation and provided an interesting insight in map zinc homeostasis. overall the majority of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes could be assigned to metal homeostasis. notably,  <dig> zinc responsive genes were clustered on a single 90 kb locus in the genome, spanning the region from map <dig> to map <dig> . therefore, we specified this locus as map specific zinc responsive genomic island .

 <dig> predicted zur box containing promoter-operator elements located on the zngi suggest the control of in toto  <dig> genes by zur. the zngi comprises lsp <dig> , an intermediate cluster with a high number of genes for ribosomal proteins , lsp <dig>  and the adjacent gene cluster map3778- <dig> . the latter is preceded by a zur box and encodes for an esx-typevii secretion system, which mediates the transport of virulence associated pe and ppe proteins  <cit> . in addition, it was shown to be necessary for iron and zinc metabolism in mtb  <cit>  as well as host-pathogen interaction  <cit> . also the zngi genes map <dig>  map3769c, map3768c, and map3767c encoding for the ribosomal proteins rpme <dig>  rpmg <dig>  rpsn <dig> and rpsr <dig>  respectively, were dramatically induced upon zinc starvation. the presence of zur binding sites upstream of the ribosomal genes in map suggested suppression by mapzur. these genes are paralogues of the genes rpme <dig>  rpmg <dig>  rpsn <dig> and rpsr <dig>  which are localised beyond the zngi in the map genome and were not induced by zinc depletion. interestingly, in contrast to the latter, the corresponding proteins encoded by rpme <dig>  rpmg, rpsn <dig> and rpsr <dig> do not bear zinc binding cxxc motifs, suggesting that they are functional substitutes of the others in the absence of zinc as it has been described for mtb, streptomyces coelicolor and bacillus subtilis  <cit> . moreover, the zngi harboured three putative zur regulated genes of cobw like proteins, which were induced to a very high extent. proteins of this family  are linked to zinc homeostasis in all kingdoms of life  <cit>  and have been found to be zur-regulated in other bacteria  <cit> . these proteins possibly constitute low-affinity zinc transporters or chaperones, which are utilized to direct zn2+ ions to the proper protein.

interestingly, contrary to so far described genes, the gene cluster map3761c-3764c on the zngi, most probably regulated by zur, was predicted to be involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. furthermore, two gene clusters lacking a predicted zur binding site located on the zngi were highly induced by zinc: a group of virulence associated membrane proteins , and an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis . together with the zinc induced expression of the paralogous ribosomal genes, the regulation of the above groups of genes suggests that map to some extent changes its metabolism to adapt to zinc starvation.

comparison of the map zinc regulon and the zur regulon of mtb  <cit>  revealed a high congruency. orthologues of  <dig> mtb zur regulated genes were found on the map zngi which however is in striking contrast to mtb where the zur regulon is organized in small clusters scattered over the genome. in addition, homologues of  <dig> genes of the mtb regulon were either not present  or regulated  in map, indicating that other genes of the zngi may substitute their functions. analysis of homologue genes and cluster analysis in other pathogenic and apathogenic mycobacteria also confirmed the unique clustering of zinc regulated genes on the zngi of map. the presence of a zngi in the sheep strain map s <dig> is likely, but since there is only an incomplete genome sequence available, we can only speculate this point.

only one predicted zur binding site was located outside the zngi, preceding map homologues  to the well described high-affinity zinc importer znuabc of e. coli
 <cit>  and salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . thus, map possesses three putative zinc responsive transporters: the znuabc transporter and two zngi located transporters, namely mptabc  and an abc-type mn2+/zn2+ transporter . all were induced by zinc starvation , however only the first two systems seem to be regulated by zur. furthermore the abc-type mn2+/zn2+ transporter and the mptabc transporter have no homologues in other mycobacteria and in concert with the above described data might enable map to more efficiently circumvent zinc starvation. together these data point to a very particular relevance of zinc in map.

beyond the zngi, zinc responsive genes mainly showed a weak reaction to zinc starvation, including the mycobactin cluster mbt <dig>  and mbt <dig> . gene expression was slightly increased but compared to the specific iron dependent response  we consider this induction as a secondary effect of metal chelation. this might also hold true for other weakly induced genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data confirmed the initial assumption of an involvement of the lineage specific gene loci lsp <dig> and lsp <dig> in metal homeostasis. but other than previously assumed, they were highly responsive to zinc starvation. moreover, we found a striking particularity for map zinc homeostasis, given by the significant clustering of zinc regulated genes on a large 90 kb spanning zinc specific locus, which was not found in other mycobacteria, and the presence of map specific zinc transporters. in general, map seems to be well adapted to maintain zinc homeostasis. the importance of zinc transporters in the gut for colonisation and survival in the mucosal environment has been shown for s. typhimurium, acinetobacter baumanii and campylobacter jejuni
. thus, presumably the map specific zngi points to particular processes of adaptation, enabling map to develop its unique gut tropism. however, this assumption has to be addressed in future studies.
