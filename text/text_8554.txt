BACKGROUND
the process of early embryonic development is determined by activation of the embryonic genome, which for bovine embryos begins as a "minor genome activation" at the 1-cell stage  <cit>  ascending to a "major genome activation" during the 8-cell to 16-cell stage  <cit> . in the absence of proper genome activation, the developing embryo will die because it can no longer support its essential developmental functions  <cit> . in the case of embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer  the somatic nucleus has to be reprogrammed in order to restart and continue the developmental process. it is believed that, guided by the ooplasm, the somatic nucleus aborts its own program of somatic gene expression and re-establishes a particular program of embryonic gene expression necessary for normal embryo development  <cit> .

embryos produced by scnt have lower developmental rates than their in vitro and in vivo produced counterparts  <cit> . embryos produced by scnt also have a greater incidence of apoptosis and consequently a lower number of cells  <cit> . additionally, scnt derived embryos have greater rates of embryo and fetal mortality, stillbirths and perinatal deaths, which bring down the overall efficiency of cloning. these alterations may be caused, at least partially, by incomplete epigenetic reprogramming of the somatic nuclei  <cit> . somatic cell chromatin transfer  attempts to facilitate the reprogramming process by exposing the somatic cells, prior to the transfer, to a mitotic cell extract, which is supposed to induce chromosome condensation and promote the removal and solubilisation of nuclear factors, enhancing nuclear remodelling  <cit> . compared with nuclear transfer, scct shows greater survival of cloned calves up to at least  <dig> month and could be a useful tool in understanding the mechanisms of reprogramming  <cit> . remarkably, a recent study did not detect any significant differences in the global gene expression profiles of scct and scnt embryos  <cit> .

embryos derived from nuclear transfer have an abnormal pattern of dna methylation, in some cases resembling that of somatic cells  <cit> . this aberrant dna methylation pattern has been inversely correlated with the developmental potential of the cloned embryos  <cit> . treatment of donor cells with dna demethylation agents, prior the nuclear transfer, may remove epigenetic marks improving the ability of the somatic cells to be fully reprogrammed by the recipient karyoplast  <cit> . global alteration of gene expression has been another finding in embryos produced by cloning. the abnormal expression of genes playing important roles in early embryonic development, implantation and fetal development is of particular interest. conversely, other studies have reported a significant reprogramming for scnt embryos by the blastocyst stage and similar transcriptome profiles to those of embryos produced in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that defects in gene expression for scnt embryos may occur later during redifferentiation and organogenesis  <cit> .

among the abnormally expressed genes reported in bovine cloned embryos are il <dig>  fgf <dig>  and fgfr <dig>  <cit> ; fgf <dig>  dnmt <dig>  mash <dig>  hsp <dig>  and interferon tau  <cit> ; acrogranin, cdx <dig>  and err <dig>  <cit> . cytokeratin  <dig>  cytokeratin  <dig>  vimentin, hsp <dig>  nidogen <dig> and mhc-i  <cit> ; hdac- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  dnmt3a, and oct <dig>  <cit> . lower levels of transcripts involved in the retinoic acid signalling pathway  were reported for cloned bovine embryos  <cit> . there have been conflicting results when it comes to the expression of particular genes in scnt and ivf embryos. such is the case of the developmentally important pou5f <dig> gene, which has been reported as misregulated in cloned embryos compared to ivf derived blastocysts in some studies  <cit> , while being detected at similar concentration in others  <cit> .

scnt is often used for the production of human proteins in the milk of transgenic animals. for the achievement of some specific transgenic phenotypes, multiple genetic modifications need to be completed through sequential modifications in primary cells prior to nuclear transfer  <cit> . since transfection and selection of transgenic cells requires nearly the entire lifespan of a cell, only one genetic modification can be completed in each cell lifespan  <cit> . therefore, consecutive rounds of cloning  are performed. it has been proposed that consecutive rounds of cloning, allow for rejuvenation and selection of transformed cultured cells  <cit>  and that it may improve the efficiency of scnt by increasing the reprogramming potential of the somatic cells  <cit> . conversely, other reports suggest that epigenetic errors could accumulate in the embryos as a result of serial cloning and prolonged in vitro culture decreasing cloning efficiency. after serial cloning up to the sixth generation was performed in mice, no signs of telomere shortening or premature ageing were observed. however, cloning efficiency significantly decreased with increasing rounds of cloning  <cit> . a greatly reduced in vitro and in vivo developmental capacity was reported for bovine embryos derived after several rounds of serial cloning  <cit> . it has been suggested that extended culture associated with transfection and selection procedures may induce changes of somatic cells, which decrease the efficiency of nuclear transfer and that these changes cannot be reversed by recloning  <cit> .

the objective of the present study was to identify the "cumulative errors" on global gene expression, caused by serial rounds of chromatin transfer, by comparing the transcriptome profile of ivf derived blastocysts to that of scct derived blastocysts from the first and fourth rounds of cloning  using oligonucleotide microarray analysis . donor cells used for first and fourth rounds of cloning  were also the target of the study as we compared the global gene expression of the scct embryos with their respective donor cells. additionally, we analyzed the expression patterns of a panel of selected genes, in fetal fibroblasts obtained from foetuses from zero to fifth rounds of chromatin transfer. our results show that a substantial reprogramming has taken place in the cloned embryos from both generations of chromatin transfer. however, there was a set of differential expressed genes in both groups of cloned embryos compared to their ivf counterparts. the number and functions of these genes could suggest accumulative misregulations probably caused by the successive rounds of cloning.

RESULTS
isolation of rna
on average  <dig>  ng of total rna were isolated from pools of  <dig> embryos . the rna integrity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , based on the ratio between the 28s and 18s ribosomal rna bands from the bioanalyzer gel-like image .

transcriptome analyses
the affymetrix genechipÂ® bovine genome array contains  <dig>  probe sets representing over  <dig>  bovine transcripts, including assemblies from approximately  <dig>  unigene clusters. in order to assess the influence of the two cycles of linear amplification, on the representation of original transcripts, we compared microarray experiments from one-cycle and two-cycle amplifications using total rna from dc <dig>  the results showed that amplification of messages using  <dig> vs.  <dig> cycles were highly consistent with a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . these data confirm the manufacturer's results using  <dig> and  <dig> cycles of linear amplification.

microarray experiments were performed in three biological replicates for all blastocysts  and donor cells . images were processed with gcos and data extracted using mas  <dig> . however, one of the ct <dig> blastocyst chips did not pass the quality control analysis  <cit>  and was excluded from the study. the analyses for ct <dig> are based on the remaining two chips in this group, which showed an appropriate p-value distribution. the gcos software expression data report showed that 56% of the probe sets were called "present"  for all donor cell chips. this number was lower for all blastocyst chips with 44%, 41%, and 47% for ivf, ct <dig>  and ct <dig> respectively. probe sets that were called "absent"  in all the samples were excluded from the analysis. therefore only  <dig>  probe sets were included in the analysis.

hierarchical clustering classified all donor cells chips in one single group indicating small differences in their gene expression profiles. all blastocysts were classified in  <dig> distinctive clusters with ivf blastocysts in one group and all cloned blastocysts in other group .

in pairwise comparisons among transcripts with a p-value <  <dig> , a false discovery rate  of 20%, and a fold change > <dig>  were considered differentially expressed. the numbers of differentially expressed transcripts in all pairwise comparisons are presented in table  <dig>  the number of probe sets that were differentially expressed between all  <dig> groups of blastocysts was significantly lower compared to the number of differentially expressed transcripts between donor cells and embryos . this numeric difference indicates that a substantial reprogramming has occurred in cloned blastocysts from both first and fourth rounds of cloning. however there were significantly less differentially expressed transcripts between cloned embryos and donor cells than between ivf blastocysts and donor cells . out of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts between both cell lines,  <dig> corresponded to absent or marginal signals, leaving only  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. chemokine binding protein  <dig>  and myocilin, trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response  were upregulated in dc <dig> compared to dc <dig>  similar to hemicentin  and similar to dolichyl pyrophosphate phosphatase  <dig>  were the genes upregulated in dc <dig> compared to dc <dig> 

different subscripts indicate statistically significant differences in the number of differentially expressed transcripts.

because the bovine genome has not been fully annotated, the annotation information available from netaffx analysis center  classifies probe sets as: 1) fully annotated bovine genes; 2) transcripts similar to specific genes, but not confirmed; 3) hypothetical proteins based on sequence similarity; 4) cdna clones; and 5) transcripts with strong, moderate or weak similarity to genes from other species. table  <dig> presents a breakdown of the differentially expressed transcripts according to these categories. only transcripts corresponding to annotated bovine genes were included in further analyses.

the probe set categories correspond to netaffx bovine genechip .

multiple comparisons through one-way analysis of variance  using a least significant differences  test showed a set of  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed in the cloned embryos and donor cells compared to their ivf counterparts. out of  <dig> genes,  <dig> were upregulated in ivf embryos compared to ct embryos and donor cells . forty two genes were upregulated in ct embryos .

genes were analyzed by one-way anova.

functional classification of genes
the gene ontology  information for each probe set recovered from netaffx analysis center  was still incomplete for several probe sets, which lacked annotation for at least one of the three ontologies biological process , molecular function , and cellular component . the annotation was complemented with information retrieved using the goanna tool part of the agbase resource at mississippi state university. all the go terms associated to each gene were uploaded into the agbase tool goslimviewer in order to obtain a high level summary of the go categories and create graphs for a better visualization of the data, determining which classes of gene products are over-represented or under-represented on each of the three ontologies for cloned embryos compared to ivf embryos. goslimviewer results are summarized in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

gene expression analysis by real time rt-pcr
in order to confirm the accuracy of microarray data, the following  <dig> genes were selected based on their relevance during embryonic development: dnmt3a, dnmt3b, igf2r, plac <dig>  pgr, bit <dig>  hmgn <dig>  hspa1a, ngdn, fbxo <dig>  and gnai <dig> . the expression patterns of the selected genes, obtained by real time pcr, were consistent with the results from the dna microarray analysis . the analysis of gene expression in the cell lines showed that both housekeeping genes, gapdh and 18s ribosomal rna, had a similar pattern of expression. the internal standard 18s ribosomal rna values were  <dig>  times greater in all groups than those of gapdh. after normalization based on both housekeeping genes, there were no differences among the groups for nfya and taspase  <dig> genes. both g <dig> and g <dig> cell lines had significantly greater concentration of palld transcript compared to g <dig>  g <dig> and, and g <dig>  for gatm, the transcript levels of g <dig> were significantly lower than in all of the other groups .

data modelling
the pathways originated using ingenuity pathway analysis showed the most important pathways in which the differentially expressed genes participate. the top networks formed by the genes upregulated in ivf embryos compared to both ct groups included cellular growth and proliferation, embryonic development, cellular assembly and organization, cellular death and response to stress . on the other hand the networks obtained from the transcripts more abundant in the cloned blastocysts compared to ivf embryos were cellular morphology cellular development, cell signaling, and metabolism . genes with a putative cumulative misregulation after serial rounds of chromatin transfer are presented on tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
it has been reported that in vitro culture conditions alter gene expression and may lead to developmental aberrations in ivf derived cattle, commonly referred to as the large offspring syndrome  <cit> . in the case of embryos produced by scnt, besides the alterations due to in vitro culture conditions, gene expression defects may be caused by improper silencing and activation of specific genes, altered chromatin remodelling, and epigenetic alterations  <cit> . but identifying key genes responsible for the general developmental failure in cloned embryos is not an easy task, since the alterations may be caused by a variety of factors including donor cell type, cell cycle stage, nuclear transfer protocol, source of the oocytes, embryo culture system, embryo transfer procedure, recipient cows management, and operators' skills  <cit> . consequently, there is a big variety of alterations that are not always shared by all cloned embryos. still, the common thread uniting many of the scnt failures can be traced to epigenetic alterations, specifically failures in chromatin remodelling and dna and histone methylation  <cit> . the fetal fibroblast cells used in this study are not fully representative of adult somatic cells. however, these cells were chosen because of their practicality and higher efficiency in scnt studies.

microarray analysis has been used to explore the transcriptome profile of cloned embryos relative to that of the donor cells and ivf embryos as a control. however, the appropriate microarray platform is crucial in order to detect changes in particular genes. smith and colleagues reported similar transcriptome profiles for cloned blastocysts and blastocysts produced by artificial insemination  <cit> . however, the cdna microarray used by smith and colleagues consisted of placenta and spleen cdna libraries, lacking embryonic genes, which therefore were not analysed. the results from the present study show an extensive reprogramming in cloned embryos by the blastocyst stage. however, the data point to a group of differentially expressed transcripts between ivf and cloned blastocysts.

serial cloning is often performed for the production of transgenic animals. although apparently healthy animals can be obtained after serial cloning, the efficiency of cloning decreases from generation to generation despite comparable blastocyst and early pregnancy rates. this increase in pregnancy losses and perinatal deaths could be caused by gene expression defects accumulated throughout the serial cloning procedures, which could be detected in blastocysts, although no phenotypic alterations are observed at this stage. furthermore, it has been proposed that the extended culture, associated with transfection and selection procedures, may induce changes in the donor cells  <cit> . the present studies show that serial cloning does not significantly affect transcriptional reprogramming of cloned blastocysts. the global transcriptome profile of blastocysts from four consecutive rounds of cloning did not significantly differ from the one obtained from blastocysts after only one round of cloning. however, for a set of genes, misregulation was significantly greater in the blastocysts obtained from four rounds of cloning . however the observed differences between blastocysts from the first and fourth rounds of cloning could be due to the fact that these are different donor cells and not of the same clonal origin.

to our knowledge this is the first study to focus on the influence of serial chromatin transfer on global transcriptome profile of embryos and donor cells. only a small proportion of the data set generated by the present study corresponded to fully annotated bovine genes . the rest of the probe sets were excluded from further analyses due to lack of annotations. progress in the annotation of the bovine genome will greatly facilitate global gene expression studies in the bovine species.

in the present study, multiple comparisons revealed five distinctive patterns of differential gene expression among all embryos and donor cells. the first pattern corresponded to  <dig>  transcripts  that had similar abundance in all five groups. housekeeping genes like gapd and actin showed this pattern of expression. the second pattern corresponded to genes that had similar expression in ivf and ct embryos, but had a very different pattern of expression in both donor cell lines. we hypothesised that these are genes that switched from the "donor cell gene expression mode" to the "embryo gene expression mode". the majority of the genes in the data set  showed this pattern, including some imprinted and embryonic specific genes such as the oct- <dig> protein coding gene , which has been reported as differentially expressed for cloned embryos in previous studies  <cit> . placenta specific  <dig>  also shows this pattern of expression . it is possible that some genes, due to their methylation pattern in the somatic cells or to their location in the chromosome, are more likely to be reprogrammed by the oocyte factors.

the third pattern corresponded to genes with a similar pattern of expression for ct embryos and donor cells, and a very different expression pattern in ivf embryos. these were  <dig>  genes with apparently incomplete reprogramming, probably with a somatic cell pattern of expression. the heat shock  <dig> kd protein  <dig> , involved in cell protection from stress and apoptosis was significantly higher in ivf embryos when compared to ct embryos and donor cells . important embryonic genes showed this pattern of expression. desmocollin  <dig>  a transmembrane glycoprotein, involved in cell adhesion that belongs to the cadherin family, was present in ivf embryos but was absent in ct embryos and donor cells. the signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , was significantly upregulated in ivf embryos when compared to both groups of cloned embryos and donor cells. a similar pattern was observed for high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain  <dig>  a gene involved in chromatin remodelling, a vital process during embryonic genome activation . the importance of both genes during morulae and blastocyst formation could make them good candidates in understanding the lower developmental rates of cloned embryos.

the fourth group of genes corresponded to only  <dig> probe sets  with a marked differential expression in all cloned embryos compared to the one observed in both ivf embryos and donor cells. the misregulation of these genes could point to a compensation mechanism after chromatin transfer. genes with this kind of expression pattern included prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  and the transcription factor gata- <dig>  both genes had a greater microarray signal in all ct embryos, but low expression in ivf and donor cells. the imprinted gene glycine amidinotransferase , showed significantly greater values in the cloned embryos compared to ivf embryos and donor cells. two interesting genes in this group were dnmt3a and dnmt3b transcripts, which are responsible for de novo methylation. both genes were significantly greater in ct- <dig> and ct- <dig> embryos compared to ivf blastocysts , which is consistent with the hypermethylation often reported in cloned blastocysts. these results do not agree with previous findings, in which dnmt3a was downregulated in nt embryos compared to ivf embryos  <cit> . zhou et al., reported similar levels of dnmt3b for embryos produced in vivo, in vitro, and by different nuclear transfer methods, including chromatin transfer  <cit> . these contrasting results confirm that alterations greatly vary and are not shared by all cloned embryos. one limitation of our study is that we have not used in vivo blastocysts which might have provided more biological means and as the physiological standard against in vitro culture conditions.

a fifth pattern corresponded to genes that had an increasing or a decreasing pattern of expression from ivf embryos through donor cells showing an intermediate pattern of expression in ct embryos. in total,  <dig> probe sets showed this pattern of expression with  <dig>  increasing, and  <dig>  decreasing from ivf through dc. it could be assumed that these genes have been partially reprogrammed, since their transcript abundance is in between ivf and donor cells. the imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor  <dig> receptor , one of the most studied genes in the large offspring syndrome, showed similar expression values in ivf and ct <dig> embryos, but significantly higher signals in ct <dig> embryos, and very high signals in both donor cells . these higher mrna levels in the fourth generation of cloning could indicate a cumulative misregulation of this gene. the bcl- <dig> inhibitor of transcription  showed the greatest values in ivf embryos, intermediate values in ct embryos and the lowest values in donor cells . the nuclear transcription factor y, alpha , showed a similar expression pattern in both ivf and ct <dig> embryos; although it was significantly lower in ct <dig> embryos and donor cells. neuroguidin , an eukaryotic translation initiation factor with important functions in embryonic development was another gene with a decreasing pattern of expression . genes with and increasing pattern of expression included f-box protein  <dig> , and guanine nucleotide binding protein alpha inhibiting activity polypeptide  <dig>  represented in figure 6c and figure 6d, respectively. transcripts for the progesterone receptor  were significantly higher in ivf embryos compared to ct embryos and donor cells . among this group of transcripts could be genes that are cumulatively affected be serial cloning.

based on the difference in gene expression for rarb, crab <dig>  thbs, serpinb <dig>  and hla-a, beyhan et al. suggest a possible role for the retinoic acid signalling pathway in the failures observed in cloned bovine embryos  <cit> . however the bovine genechip does not contain a retinoic acid receptor beta  probe set. it only contains a probe set that corresponds to a bovine est with similarity to the rat rarb . in the present data, crab <dig> and thbs <dig> were slightly higher in ivf embryos, although without statistical significance. they also found differential gene expression among several genes in both donor cells . in the current study gatm was significantly downregulated in donor cells from the fifth successive generation of chromatin transfer .

at the blastocyst stage there is an extensive reprogramming of cloned embryos leading to very similar transcriptomes in ivf and ct blastocysts. however, there were around  <dig> differentially expressed genes in both ct embryos compared to ivf. for some genes, the differences were significantly greater in ct <dig> when compared to ct <dig>  suggesting a possible cumulative missregulation caused by serial cloning. genes involved in transcription, cellular proliferation, embryonic development, cellular death, and response to stress are over represented in ivf embryos; many of these genes are present in the nucleus, which was the cell component overrepresented in ivf embryos. genes involved in cell morphology, cell development, and metabolism were over expressed in donor cells and in cloned embryos when compared to ivf, suggesting that they were not properly silenced in the donor nucleus. the up regulation of genes involved in metabolism should be further explored as it could be linked to the large size of cloned animals.

CONCLUSIONS
as gene expression profile can only show one step in cell phenotype and function control, namely transcriptome regulation, proteomic analysis could complement this study by providing a more complete picture of the regulation of embryonic development. with a more complete bovine genome annotation, more of the differentially expressed transcripts could be analyzed further providing more information for the currently unidentified transcripts, which, in the present study represented around 18% of the dataset. gene ontology information for a proportion of the differentially expressed genes is still incomplete. thus, for some of the genes the cellular component is known, but the biological process and/or its molecular function is not documented. it is interesting that the majority of genes upregulated in ct blastocysts participate in metabolism processes, while the percentage of metabolism genes in ivf blastocyst was lower compared to signalling pathway genes.

the present study provides a data set that could be useful in identifying epigenetic errors in cloning and may facilitate our understanding of the reprogramming process in scct. future studies should involve more of the successive generations of cloned embryos and their respective donor cells to identify cumulative misregulated genes. gene expression studies from fetal, newborn, and placental tissues could identify genes that are responsible for abnormalities, abortions, stillborns and low birth rate. functional studies should target particular genes that play key roles in molecular reprogramming and early embryo development and manipulate their mrna concentrations in scct embryos, to mimic that of ivf embryos.
