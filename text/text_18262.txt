BACKGROUND
rice, a staple food for over half of the global population, is endowed with rich genetic diversity, which is evident from the availability of numerous landraces and improved cultivars in the gene banks. basmati is a unique varietal group of rice germplasm that has gained popularity as a speciality rice worldwide, mainly due to conscious and continuous selection by man over thousands of years for his diverse quality preferences  <cit> .

basmati rice occupies a special place among all aromatic rice cultivars by virtue of its unique quality characterized by extra long slender grain, lengthwise excessive kernel elongation upon cooking, soft and fluffy texture of the cooked rice, and exquisite aroma. it is, therefore, regarded as the “king of rices” . furthermore, previous diversity studies of rice revealed that the basmati rice forms a separate cluster quite apart from indica and japonica groups  <cit> . basmati expresses its unique features only when grown in the north-western foothills of the himalayas. due to its location specific quality performance, basmati is now a geographical indication  in the indian subcontinent. india has exported  <dig>  million mt of basmati rice to the world for the worth of usd  <dig>  million during the year 2013– <dig> .

in order to develop rice varieties suitable to various consumer quality preferences, knowledge of the genetics of key quality traits is inevitable. in the past, several genes/qtls governing quality traits were identified in indica and japonica sub species of oryza sativa. the major genes related to quality traits includes waxy gene for amylose content   <cit> , alk gene for gelatinization temperature   <cit> , fgr for fragrance  <cit> , gs <dig> for grain size and grain weight  <cit>  and chalk <dig> for chalkiness  <cit> . in addition to these major genes, there are many minor qtls governing the traits in japonica  <cit>  and indica  <cit> . although a vast literature is available on the genetics and mapping of qtls in indica and japonica rice varieties, not much information is available on basmati rice per se. among the limited number of studies available, one qtl for kernel elongation after cooking has been identified on chromosome  <dig> employing two rflp markers viz., rz <dig> and rz <dig>  <cit> . four qtls for amylose content, two for gel consistency  and five for gelatinization temperature  have been identified from a cross between jasmine variety kdml <dig> and non aromatic ct <dig>  <cit> . using bulked segregant analysis of 247 f <dig> individuals of a cross between basmati370/asd  <dig>  two microsatellite markers rm <dig> and rm <dig> have been identified and reported to be associated with grain breadth and cooked grain breadth, respectively  <cit> . subsequently, qtls for grain length , grain breadth , lb ratio, aroma, kernel elongation ratio, amylose content and alkali spreading value have been identified in a mapping population derived from a cross between pusa <dig>  an evolved basmati cultivar and pusa <dig>  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to identify and map qtls linked to economically important traits of basmati rice. also, an attempt has been made to discover the candidate genes underlying the major qtls by aligning basmati genome sequence with available nipponbare rice genome sequence information.

methods
plant materials
the traditional basmati variety, basmati <dig> and the semidwarf non‐basmati variety, jaya were chosen as parents for developing a mapping population for the following reasons. the traditional basmati varieties known by different names in the subcontinent, in all likelihood, are derivatives of the single local variety i.e., basmati <dig> or basmati370‐like variety  <cit> . most of the basmati varieties released as elite basmati varieties since  <dig> from india  and pakistan  have basmati <dig> as one of the donor strains in the breeding programs. genetic diversity study employing issrs  and ssrs  reveals that the high yielding variety jaya to be genetically quite distinct from basmati <dig>  <cit> . the parents jaya and basmati varieties possess distinct and contrasting physico‐chemical characters especially jaya has very high amylose content than basmati <dig>  the genetic material consisted of progenies derived from a cross between basmati <dig> and jaya. one hundred f <dig> seeds were used to raise f <dig> generation during kharif,  <dig>  the plant phenotype, grain appearance before and after cooking, and chalkiness characters of basmati <dig>  jaya and their f <dig> hybrid and f2 progeny are shown in fig. 1; additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the f <dig> population was grown along with f1s and the parents in wet land farm of the agricultural research institute , rajendranagar, hyderabad. out of  <dig>  f <dig> plants,  <dig> were randomly chosen as mapping population for construction of the linkage map and qtl mapping. the f <dig> population was advanced to f <dig> for the validation of the qtls identified in the f <dig> population. to confirm the inheritance of the agronomic traits, one more set of f <dig> population comprising of  <dig> plants of the same cross was grown in andhra pradesh rice research institute , maruteru, west godavari, ap. in addition, a total of  <dig> recombinant inbred lines  was developed from the f <dig> individuals by single-seed descent method and grown in kharif  <dig>  the phenotypic measurements were recorded using the standard procedures for the eighteen traits in the mapping populations as given below.fig.  <dig> agronomic and quality traits of basmati <dig>  jaya and f <dig>  a. plant phenotypes of basmati <dig>  f <dig> and jaya; b - c. grain appearance traits of basmati <dig>  jaya and f <dig> before and cooking and f <dig> before and cooking respectively; d. grain chalkiness of basmati <dig>  jaya and f1




plant height  - length of the tallest tiller from ground level to the tip of the panicle, number of panicles  - number of ear bearing tillers per plant, panicle length  - length in cm from neck to the tip of the panicle excluding awn, spikelet number  - number of spikelets including empty and filled ones per panicle averaged over 4– <dig> panicles, filled grains  - number of filled spikelets per panicle averaged over 4– <dig> panicles, chaffy grains  - number of sterile spikelets or chaffy grains per panicle averaged over 4– <dig> panicles, spikelet fertility  - ratio of filled spikelets to the total number of filled and chaffy spikelets per panicle, expressed in percentage, grain weight  - weight in grams of  <dig> filled spikelets, single plant yield  - weight in grams of total filled grains per plant.

after maturation, the grains were harvested and stored at room temperature for at least 3 months before processing. the analysis of quality traits was carried out at directorate of rice research , hyderabad. hulls were removed from 50 g of rough rice from each plant using a huller  to obtain brown rice. embryos and the bran layers were removed  from brown rice using miller . the standard procedures were followed for recording data of quality traits as mentioned below:

grain length  and grain breadth  - measured using grain shape tester or dial micrometer for a minimum of  <dig> full rice grains with both the tips intact, grain length- breadth  - calculated as the grain length divided by grain breadth, chalkiness - ten whole grains from each of the plant were placed on light box for scoring chalkiness. degree of chalkiness was determined by adopting the standard evaluation system for rice, irri- <dig> protocols, grain length after elongation  and elongation ratio  - kernels of rice varieties expand either breadth wise or lengthwise upon cooking. the elongation test consisted of soaking of  <dig> whole milled kernels in 20 ml of distilled water for 10 minutes and subsequently placing them in water bath at 98 °c for 10 min. the cooked rice was then transferred to a petri dish lined with filter paper. ten cooked whole grains were selected and length was measured by placing them on graph paper. the elongation was measured as the ratio of the average length of cooked rice kernels to the average length of uncooked rice kernels, aroma - the presence of aroma from the rice leaf was evaluated by following the method developed by sood and siddiq  <cit> . a strongly scented variety, basmati <dig> and a non-scented variety jaya were used as checks for scoring of aroma, alkali spreading value /gelatinization temperature  - the method of little et al.  <cit>  was used for conducting the alkali spreading test. a duplicate set of six whole-milled grains without cracks was selected and placed in a plastic box  containing  <dig>  % koh solution at 29 °c for 23 hrs. then grains were carefully separated using forceps, and asv of the grains was scored by visual assessment by seven scale score following standard evaluation system for rice, irri- <dig> protocols, and amylose content  - the procedure of juliano et al.  <cit>  was used for estimation of ac.

phenotypic data analysis of parents, f <dig> and f <dig> individuals
correlations between character pairs and test for normal distribution were computed at p < <dig>  and p <  <dig>  in microsoft-excel . heterosis, heterobeltiosis and inbreeding depression were calculated using the following formulae. heterosis=f1−mp/mpx100heterobeltiosis=f1−bp/bpx <dig> 

where, mp is mid parent and bp is better parent inbreedingdepression=f1−f2/f1x <dig> 

tests of significance among parents, f <dig> and mid parental values were calculated employing statplus v  <dig>  software .

construction of ssr linkage map
dna from leaf material of the parents i.e., basmati <dig> and jaya, f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and recombinant inbred lines  was extracted by using the modified ctab method  <cit> . pcr amplification was performed in a 10 μl volume containing 10 mm tris–hcl ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  unit of taq polymerase, 50 μm of dntps, and  <dig>  μm of each primer with 10 ng of genomic dna on a thermal cycler  with a ramp speed of  <dig> . pcr samples were mixed with bromo-phenol blue and run on a 3 % agarose gel  containing ethidium bromide along with 50 bp ladder . gels were photographed using bio-rad molecular imager gel doc xr system.

a set of  <dig> ssr markers spanning all the  <dig> rice chromosomes was screened between basmati <dig> and jaya strains. out of which,  <dig> markers that were polymorphic between parents were used for screening the populations. the heterozygosity of the f <dig> hybrids has been confirmed using the polymorphic markers. the χ <dig> goodness of fit against 1:2: <dig> segregation ratio in the f <dig> population was tested using mapdisto software  <cit> . linkage map was constructed using the mapmaker version  <dig>   <cit>  following kosambi mapping function. linkage groups were determined using 'group' command with lod score of  <dig>  and a recombination fraction of  <dig> . order of the markers for each group was determined using 'order' and 'ripple' commands. linkage groups were assigned to the respective chromosomes based on the rice genetic maps developed at cornell university  <cit> .

qtl analysis
qtls were detected by interval and composite interval mapping methods of windows qtl cartographer v. <dig>  software. composite interval mapping was conducted using the default settings  .

basmati genome sequencing
basmati <dig> rice dna was sequenced on solid  <dig> using mate pair library kit with the insert size of  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. raw data was generated in csfasta and qual files, and was used for further analysis. using lifescope v <dig> . <dig> software, the files were converted into xsq file format. reads in xsq were mapped against nipponbare reference sequence of complete rice genome sequence from http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/. alignment results were produced in bam file format to detect variations by variant caller algorithm. for variant annotation snpeff  tool was used.

RESULTS
phenotypic evaluations and correlations among traits
the parents basmati <dig> and jaya differed significantly  with respect to majority of the traits studied, except for panicle length, chaffy grains, spikelet fertility and single plant yield . the mean of the f <dig> hybrids was intermediate for panicle length,  <dig> seed weight, grain length , grain breadth  lb ratio, alkali spreading value, amylose content, and aroma. for rest of the traits, the f <dig> mean exceeded the mean of the better parent. except aroma, all the agronomic and quality traits showed transgressive segregation ranging between  <dig> and 100 % . as aroma is measured on 1– <dig> scale whereby the parents score the extremes of the scale, it was not possible to get transgressive segregants for this trait. however, in case of spikelet fertility, all the f <dig> plants fell below the parental average resulting in 100 % transgressive segregants. transgressive segregants observed for the traits such as panicle length, filled grains, spikelet number, spikelet fertility, single plant yield and grain length significantly exceeded either of the parents. however, in case of plant height, grain length, elongation ratio, alkali spreading value and amylose content, transgressive segregants exceeded only basmati <dig> whereas the number of panicles, chaffy grains and seed weight exceeded jaya parent . however, the number of transgressive segregants with respect to grain breadth, length-breadth ratio and chalkiness did not significantly  exceed that of the parents.table  <dig> test of significance among parents and f1s for  <dig> traits

many of the quantitative traits showed normal distribution in f <dig>  f <dig> and ril populations in both the environments  suggesting polygenic nature of the traits . as expected, in all the populations chaffy grains and spikelet fertility skewed towards the lowest and highest values, respectively. in contrast, amylose content and chalkiness showed unimodal distribution, whereas alkali spreading value, aroma and chalkiness showed abnormal distribution in f <dig> and ril populations indicating that these traits might be under the control of few major genes and modifiers.

of the agronomic traits, number of panicles and filled grains per panicle showed significant positive correlation with plant yield in f <dig> and ril populations . spikelet number showed positive and significant correlation with panicle length, filled grains and chaffy grains . plant height also showed significant positive correlations with panicle length. as expected, spikelet fertility showed highly significant negative correlation with chaffy grains, while positive association with filled grains. panicle length also showed a significant  and positive association with filled grains and spikelet number.table  <dig> correlation coefficients among  <dig> traits of f <dig> population derived from the cross between basmati <dig> and jaya

in case of quality traits, only grain appearance and cooking traits showed association in both the f <dig> and ril populations. as expected, lb ratio showed a significant positive association with grain length and negative correlation with grain breadth. similarly, grain length after cooking strongly associated with the elongation ratio . the physico-chemical traits like amylose content, chalkiness, asv did not show any association among themselves and with other traits clearly indicating the oligogenic nature of the traits.table  <dig> comparison of basmati genetic map with previously published rice genetic maps



parental polymorphism and segregation of marker loci
in the present study,  <dig> of the  <dig> microsatellite markers tested produced polymorphic and scorable bands  between the parents basmati <dig> and jaya. of  <dig> polymorphic loci,  <dig> markers which could not be scored were excluded from screening the f <dig> population. nine markers were found to be unlinked. the remaining  <dig> markers used for construction of genetic linkage map comprised of  <dig> rice microsatellite markers, two from the waxy gene , two markers linked to major qtl of grain length , and one gene  specific sts  marker. out of  <dig> markers,  <dig>  showed varying degrees of segregation distortion on all the  <dig> chromosomes suggesting that the distortion was random and not confined to any specific part of the rice genome . majority of the markers represented heterozygotes, while very few  showed basmati <dig> alleles. the highest number of markers showing distorted segregation were mapped to chromosome  <dig> , whereas the lowest number  was mapped to chromosome  <dig> 

linkage map
for mapping qtls, a genetic map has been constructed employing 181 f <dig> offspring and  <dig> markers. the linkage map  placed  <dig> markers on  <dig> linkage groups spanning a total map length of  <dig>  cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent marker loci. however, there were five large genetic gaps of 55–72 cm on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  excluding these genetic gaps, the average interval of remaining markers was  <dig>  cm. a comparison of basmati genetic map was made with previously published genetic maps and represented in table  <dig> 

qtl mapping
in all,  <dig> qtls were identified for  <dig> agronomic and grain quality traits . of these, majority of the alleles with enhanced effect were found to be contributed by basmati parent. of  <dig> qtls,  <dig> qtls explained more than 15 % phenotypic variation between parents. very few qtls were identified for plant height, number of filled grains, spikelet number and single plant yield. this may be attributed to various reasons like genetically distant populations, non-detection of minor qtls, and environmental effects.table  <dig> quantitative trait loci  detected in basmati370/jaya f <dig> population

qtls for plant height
only one qtl, designated as qph <dig> , was identified for plant height trait on chromosome  <dig> at an interval of rm302‐rm <dig> and it accounted for  <dig>  % phenotypic variance. alleles from basmati <dig> were associated with increased plant height.

qtls for panicle length
two minor qtls were identified for panicle length. of which, one qtl was on chromosome  <dig>  and another on chromosome  <dig>  with marker intervals of rm6318-rm <dig> and rm276-rm <dig>  respectively. the enhanced quantitative effect was contributed by the basmati <dig> suggesting that a major part of the variation in panicle length is due to environmental influence.

qtls for filled grains
a single qtl designated as qfg <dig>  was identified on chromosome  <dig> in the marker interval of rm11968‐rm <dig>  it explained  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance between the parents indicating the possible involvement of a major gene governing the trait. increasing effect of this qtl resulted from the basmati parent.

qtls for chaffy grains
a total of three qtls influencing chaffy grains designated as qcg <dig> , qcg <dig> , and qcg <dig>  were identified one each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. together they explained  <dig>  % phenotypic variation. the increasing effect at all the loci for chaffy grains was contributed by jaya parent.

qtls for spikelet number
two regions were found to be associated with qtls for spikelet number viz., qsn <dig>  and qsn <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. of the two qtls, the qtl qsn <dig>  explained zero percent phenotypic variation of the trait suggesting that the genes within this qtl region might be having opposite effects, whereas qsn <dig>  accounted for  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation with the allele from the jaya parent contributing to the enhancing effect.

qtls for spikelet fertility
three qtls, one on chromosomes  <dig>  and remaining two on chromosome  <dig>  affecting spikelet fertility were identified. together they accounted for  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance. at all the three loci basmati parent contributed to spikelet fertility.

qtls for single plant yield
two qtls, qspy <dig>  and qspy <dig>  were identified for single plant yield on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the qtl qspy <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> explained  <dig>  % phenotypic variance. the other qtl, qspy <dig>  accounted for only  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance. the allele for increased grain yield was contributed by basmati <dig> for qspy <dig>  and jaya for qspy <dig> .

qtls for grain length
a total of two qtls viz., qgl <dig>  and qgl <dig>  with phenotypic variance of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, were detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the increasing effect for these two qtls was associated with basmati <dig> allele.

qtls for grain breadth
three qtls, qgb <dig> , qgb <dig>  and qgb <dig>  were found to be responsible for grain breadth. of them, one qtl, qgb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> had a major effect explaining  <dig>  % phenotypic variance and one qtl qgb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> had a relatively minor effect explaining  <dig>  % phenotypic variance. in all these qtls, increased effect was contributed by the parent jaya. for the qtl qgb <dig> , basmati <dig> and jaya alleles have opposite effects resulting in zero percent variance in phenotype. the two qtls, qgb <dig>  and qgb <dig>  identified in the present study appears to be novel.

qtls for length-breadth ratio /grain size
a total of three qtls influencing this trait were identified. in all the qtls, alleles from basmati <dig> contributed to increase in lb ratio. the qtls, qlb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and qlb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> explained  <dig>  and  <dig>  % phenotypic variation, respectively. the other qtl, qlb <dig>  explained  <dig>  % phenotypic variance.

qtls for grain length after cooking 
a qtl associated with glac, qglac <dig>  contributing  <dig>  % phenotypic variance was located on chromosome  <dig>  basmati allele was associated with an increase of glac as was the case in grain length.

qtls for elongation ratio 
one qtl, qer <dig>  was identified for this trait on chromosome  <dig> explaining  <dig>  % phenotypic variance. the allele from a basmati <dig> contributed to the elongation ratio at this region.

qtls for alkali spreading value / gelatinization temperature 
one major qtl for asv, qasv <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> was identified with the highest lod value of  <dig>  explaining a maximum of  <dig>  % phenotypic variance. the allele from jaya had a strong positive effect on asv. qtl cartographer lod peak for alkali spreading value is given in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> distribution of qtls for  <dig> traits in the molecular linkage map of basmati. qtls are indicated in bold  at right side of the linkage group. for codes of the traits refer table  <dig>  names of the markers are represented left side of the linkage group. numbers in parenthesis are genetic distance between markers in centimorgans 



qtls for amylose content 
one qtl qac <dig>  explaining  <dig>  % phenotypic variance was detected on chromosome  <dig>  the jaya allele had an increasing effect on this trait. the qtl identified here is in contrary to the previous reports whereby the major qtl controlling ac  was located on chromosome  <dig> 

qtls for aroma
six qtls designated as qarm <dig> , qarm <dig> , qarm <dig> , qarm <dig> , qarm <dig>  and qarm <dig>  influencing aroma were identified. of these, three qtls qarm <dig> , qarm <dig>  and qarm <dig>  were located on chromosome  <dig> explaining  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % phenotypic variance, respectively. the other three qtls qarm <dig> , qarm <dig>  and qarm <dig>  located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, together contributed  <dig>  % phenotypic variance. these qtls are novel ones and are specific to basmati varieties as they are being reported for the first time.

qtls for chalkiness 
a total of two qtls, qchk <dig>  and qchk <dig>  were identified on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with the increased effects from the basmati and jaya, respectively. the qtls for grain breadth and chalkiness were found to be co-localised and showed a positive significant correlation. our results are consistent with the earlier study  <cit> .

qtl clusters for grain appearance traits
in the present study, qtls related to highly correlated traits like grain breadth, grain length, and length-breadth ratio were found to be located on the same genomic region of chromosome  <dig> viz., qgl <dig> , qgb <dig> , qlb <dig>  and qer <dig>  as reported earlier  <cit> . however, this trend was not seen for other significantly correlated traits such as plant height, panicle length, filled grains and single plant yield. the qtls relating to these traits have been mapped onto different chromosomes implying that these traits are possibly controlled by independent and unrelated genes.

however, in the region of rm <dig> and rm <dig> effects of three qtls for grain breadth , grain length , and length-breadth ratio  are in different directions, suggesting involvement of tightly linked genes as the cause of the correlation of these traits.

confirmation of qtls in f <dig> population
as the quantitative traits are with low heritability, the phenotypic mean of the f <dig> progeny derived from each of the f <dig> plant along with its genotyping data was used  in order to confirm the mapped qtls identified in f <dig> population. using f2: <dig> design, we have identified a total of  <dig> qtls for various agronomic traits viz., plant height , number of panicles , chaffy grains , spikelet number , spikelet fertility  and plant yield . of these, two qtls viz., qph <dig>  for plant height and qspy <dig>  for plant yield have been commonly observed in both f <dig> and f2: <dig> designs with a phenotypic variance of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively .

qtl mapping in the ril population
when we compared the qtls identified in the f <dig> population with that of rils of the cross between basmati <dig> and jaya, we could identify only  <dig> common qtls for  <dig> traits in both the populations . the phenotypic variance of all the qtls except filled grains and plant yield was more than 15 % within a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. in ril population, qtl for alkali spreading value  showed high lod  and phenotypic variance  similar to that observed in the f <dig> population. this clearly suggests that even with preliminary mapping populations like f <dig>  it is possible to identify the major qtls with an appropriate population size.

gene ontology  analysis of the genes underlying major qtls
since a typical qtl region contains several hundreds of genes, it is necessary to filter them further in order to pinpoint the right candidate gene underlying the trait. given the advances in rice genome annotation, now it is possible to integrate the putative gene function with the associated gene ontology  terms. in the present study, the total number of genes underlying each major qtl interval was retrieved from the ricetogo browser . using this list of total genes in each major-effect qtl marker interval, the percentage of annotated genes and significantly overrepresented go terms were estimated. the percentage of annotated genes for each promising qtl varied from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % with an average of  <dig>  %, while significantly enriched or overrepresented go terms ranged from zero to  <dig>  %, the average being  <dig>  % .table  <dig> known qtls/ genes and go terms underlying the major qtls


discussion
with the advent of high yielding varieties ensuring higher farm returns, serious threat to basmati rices was perceived by the breeders prompting them to resort to breeding for varieties of basmati quality in high yielding background. but for reasons that are beginning to be understood, no variety ideally matching the traditional basmati could be evolved. genetic investigations have revealed that all traits except one or two are controlled quantitatively and selections based on phenotype are not reliable enough  <cit> . the present study was undertaken with the objective of identifying qtls governing the key characters of basmati rice. we have identified  <dig> qtls governing  <dig> economically important traits of basmati rice employing f <dig>  f <dig>  and recombinant inbred line  mapping population derived from a cross between basmati <dig> and a semi-dwarf rice variety jaya. out of  <dig> major-effect qtls identified, four qtls coincided with the previously known genes sd <dig>  gs <dig>  alk <dig> and fgr and for the remaining qtls, candidate genes were predicted by comparing basmati genome sequence with that of nipponbare. so far, many major qtls have been mapped in rice, however, to our knowledge, this study is the first attempt made to carry out genome-wide mapping for the dissection of the genetic basis of economically important traits of basmati rice.

divergence and distinctness of basmati rice
in the present study, the polymorphic markers were found distributed on all the  <dig> chromosomes of basmati rice . the existence of high parental polymorphism  provided evidence to the divergence and distinctness of basmati rice from the other rice groups viz., indica and japonica  <cit> . the percent polymorphism detected in this study is higher than the previously reported value  where an evolved basmati variety  was used  <cit>  and lower  when a traditional basmati  was used as a parent  <cit> . the significant effects of distorted markers on linkage estimation provide insights for genetic mapping analysis of genes or qtls. out of  <dig> markers,  <dig> showed varying degrees of segregation distortion on all the  <dig> chromosomes suggesting that the distortion was random and not confined to any specific region of the rice genome . our results are in agreement with earlier findings  <cit>  wherein segregation distorted loci were distributed over eight chromosomes viz.,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  majority of the markers represented heterozygosity, while very few  showed basmati <dig> alleles. the highest number of markers  showing distorted segregation were mapped to chromosome  <dig>  whereas the lowest number  was mapped to chromosome  <dig> fig.  <dig> qtl cartographer lod peak for alkali spreading value. a) markers and their genetic distances are given in x-axis and lod values in y-axis; b) phenotypic variance explained by the alkali spreading value qtl



construction of linkage map
according to lander and botstein  <cit> , the linkage map with an average interval less than 20 cm is suitable for qtl mapping. the genetic map of basmati is  <dig>   cm and is shorter  than the map reported by qi-jun et al.  <cit>  and longer than some of the notable maps constructed using inter-sub specific rice populations that are either  <dig>  cm  <cit>  or  <dig>  cm  <cit>  .

in this study, we observed higher genetic distances between some of the markers and this could be attributed to  deviation of  <dig>  % of markers from actual segregation ratios as pointed out in the previous study  <cit> ,  stretching effect of markers on chromosomes caused by small population size  <cit> , and  map expansion due to excess heterozygosity in segregating markers. our results are in agreement with that of knox and ellis  <cit> . the increase in the total map length due to stretching effect has been reported in several crops including rice  <cit> , sorghum  <cit>  and barley  <cit> .

using populations derived from a cross between basmati <dig> and jaya parents, we detected  <dig> qtls and compared them with previously reported ones. for plant height, only one qtl, designated as qph <dig> , was identified on chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, near qph <dig> , semi dwarf gene, sd <dig> which encodes a gibberellic acid 20-oxidase  , that catalyzes the conversion of ga <dig> to ga <dig> in gibberellic acid biosynthesis in rice  was found to be present. ishimaru et al.  identified a sucrose phosphate synthase gene controlling plant height on a different region of the same chromosome  <cit> . for panicle length two minor qtls were identified one each on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> . previous studies reported an aberrant panicle organization- <dig>  gene encoding an f-box protein on chromosome  <dig>  a mutation in this gene was reported to result in reduced panicle length and less number of spikelets per panicle  <cit> . in the present study we identified a single qtl designated as qfg <dig>  for filled grains on chromosome  <dig>  like plant height qtl, this qtl also was very close to sd <dig> gene . the cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems was previously reported to down regulate osckx <dig> which then results in increase in the reproductive organs causing enhanced grain yield  <cit> . a gene underlying grain number qtl, gn1a encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase  that degrades phytohormone cytokinin has also been reported on chromosome  <dig>  however, the qtl detected in the present study and gn1a are not same suggesting that qfg <dig>  seems to harbour other candidate genes that control grain number through mechanism that are yet to be elucidated. a gene underlying major qtl  which encodes a cct domain protein has also been identified on chromosome  <dig> with a major effect on the number of grains per panicle and heading date  <cit> .

for single plant yield, we identified two qtls, qspy <dig>  and qspy <dig>  on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. previous reports identified a yield improving qtl gy2- <dig> using the parents dongxiong  and guichao <dig>  and located it on upstream of the qtl qspy <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this qtl was governed by a leucine rich repeat receptor kinase gene cluster.

qtl mapping of grain appearance traits
a total of two qtls for grain length viz., qgl <dig>  and qgl <dig>  were detected on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. interestingly, these regions coincide with major qtls reported for grain size by numerous other studies carried across different environments and genetic backgrounds . therefore, the present study tends to support the general conclusion made earlier  <cit>  that a substantial proportion of qtls affecting a trait particularly those having major effects can be identified under different environments. the major qtl i.e., gs <dig> which controls both grain length and weight has been previously identified on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . it has been dissected into a gene which encodes a putative pepb -like domain, a transmembrane region, a putative tnfr  /ngfr  family cysteine rich domain, and a vwfc  module. comparative sequence analysis identified a non-sense mutation in the second exon of the putative gs <dig> gene in all long-grain varieties when compared to small grain varieties. this mutation causes a  <dig> amino acid truncation in the c-terminal region of the predicted protein, suggesting that gs <dig> may function as a negative regulator for grain size  <cit> . it can be inferred that the major qtl for grain length detected in this study on chromosome  <dig> is likely to be the same locus as the one reported by earlier studies  <cit> . it is also interesting to note that the chromosome region of maize flanked by umc164c and umc <dig> on chromosome  <dig> harbouring a qtl for kernel length is homologous to the short arm of the rice chromosome  <dig> suggesting the possibility of orthology between rice and maize genes governing kernel length in this region  <cit> . the qtl, qgl <dig>  identified in the present study also coincides with the earlier reports. since the underlying gene has not been identified yet, this qtl could be a potential candidate for dissection.

for grain breadth, out of three qtls qgb <dig> , qgb <dig>  and qgb <dig>  identified in the present study, two qtls, qgb <dig>  and qgb <dig>  appears to be novel since major qtl/gene  reported by other groups were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  a major qtl for grain width, i.e., gw <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  has been identified; which encodes a ring type protein with e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity and is known to function in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> . further, loss of gw <dig> function, increases cell number resulting in a larger or wider spikelet hull and accelerated grain milk filling rate which consequently enhances grain width, weight and yield. similarly, a qtl for grain width, i.e., qgw <dig> on chromosome  <dig> had been delimited to  <dig>  bp fragment of kasalath genomic region  <cit> . comparative analysis of kasalath revealed that nipponbare region harboured a 1212 bp deletion and several snps. a recent study in maize demonstrated that the grain width gene on chromosome  <dig> i.e., gw <dig> has two orthologous duplicated genes viz., zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig> with similar function of controlling the kernel size and weight even after crop diversification during evolution  <cit> .

the co‐localization of qtls for grain breadth and chalkiness as well as positive significant correlation between these two traits observed in the present study suggests that breeders can simultaneously improve these two traits. these results are consistent with the earlier study  <cit>  where qtls for grain width and chalkiness were mapped at a marker interval of rg <dig> and c <dig> on the same region of the chromosome  <dig>  recently, it has been reported that a gene influencing grain chalkiness i.e., chalk <dig> encodes a vacuolar h+-translocating pyrophosphatase  <cit> . this gene is located upstream of qchk <dig> . interestingly, a gene governing vacuolar-processing enzyme  was located within the qtl region of qchk <dig> . in the same qtl region, soluble starch synthase  <dig> , a key enzyme in the starch biosynthesis pathway is also located. these two qtls seem to be potential targets for manoeuvring chalkiness in rice.

a total of three qtls influencing length-breadth ratio  / grain size were identified, out of which qlb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and qlb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> were located in the vicinities of qgl <dig>  controlling grain length and qgb <dig>  controlling grain breadth traits, respectively. such association is not surprising because lb ratio is a derived trait obtained by dividing the grain length by grain breadth. our results are consistent with previous reports obtained across different environments and genetic backgrounds  <cit>  suggesting that these qtls are controlled by a few major genes with modifiers. hence, these qtls may be considered as potential candidates for future fine mapping and cloning studies.

qtl mapping of cooking quality traits
we identified qtl for grain length after cooking  on chromosome  <dig>  although the grain length after cooking is one of the unique quality traits of the basmati rice, the genomic regions governing the trait are not yet identified. in non-basmati rices, however, scattered reports of mapping qtl regions for this trait are available. among them, initially, a qtl on chromosome  <dig> associated with cooked kernel elongation has been identified and concluded that this qtl was loosely linked to the fragrance gene  <cit> . subsequently, three qtls on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and a single qtl on chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and two qtls each on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  have been identified for this trait.

we have identified one qtl for elongation ratio , qer <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  however, previously, a qtl for er, elr11- <dig> was identified on chromosome  <dig>  likewise, three more qtls have been identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with major qtl being qer- <dig>  <cit> .

one major qtl for alkali spreading value, qasv <dig>  identified on chromosome  <dig> was mapped along with alk gene . the alk gene encodes soluble starch synthase iia  and is associated with gelatinization temperature. thus our results are in agreement with the previous reports in showing that gt is primarily controlled by alk gene  <cit> . however, contrary to these results, it has been demonstrated that gt is controlled by a waxy gene  <cit> . these observations infer that the genetic factors other than the alk gene are probably involved in altering the gt variation indicating that alk is a major but not the sole player in gt variation. previous reports suggested that the ssiia is one of the important biosynthetic enzymes determining starch structure and its properties  <cit> . the ssiia enzyme seems to have a role in the elongation of a and b <dig> amylopectin chains, and determines the ratio of two chain lengths, i.e., l- type  and s-type   <cit> . however, in basmati rice, being a separate group from indica and japonica rice, it would be interesting to understand the role as well as the structure of ssiia. in the present study, we identified one qtl for amylose content, qac <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  although different amylose classes viz., waxy , low , intermediate  and high  are known to be associated with the variability in the waxy gene which encodes granule- bound starch synthase  on chromosome  <dig>  the waxy gene alone could not explain the global phenotypic variability of the trait due to the availability of subclasses within each major class prompting us to speculate the existence of the loci other than waxy gene  <cit> . probably, the qtl identified in the present study interacts with the waxy locus to control the final amylose content which is specific to basmati rices.

the key gene governing the aroma encodes betain aldehyde dehydrogenase  that is known to be located on chromosome  <dig>  further, it has been reported that all the fragrant rices harbour an 8 bp deletion when compared to the non-fragrant varieties  <cit> . we have identified six novel qtls that are specific to basmati variety as they are being reported for the first time. contrary to many studies where aroma is reported to be controlled by a single recessive gene, in the present study aroma behaved like a polygenic trait. of six qtls for aroma, three from basmati <dig> and four from jaya explained the increased effect, suggesting that the environment where the experiment was conducted seemed to influence the expression of aroma. moreover, basmati needs cool temperatures during flowering period for expression of its unique traits especially pleasant aroma. the non-detection of major qtls for the aroma could be attributed to the current experimental conditions.

qtl clusters for grain appearance traits
several earlier studies have demonstrated that qtls for correlated traits often map to the same chromosome regions  <cit> . in our study, we have found qtls related to highly correlated traits like gb, gl and lb ratio to be located on the same genomic region of chromosome  <dig>  classical quantitative genetics assumes that trait correlation can be attributed to the effect of pleiotropy or to the tight linkage of causative genes. if pleiotropism is the major reason, coincidence of both the location of qtl for related traits as well as the direction of their genetic effects can be expected. if the tight physical linkage of the genes is the major reason, the direction of the genetic effect of qtl for different traits may be different, although the coincidence of the location of qtls can still be expected  <cit> .

stable qtls or major qtls of promise
the genomic regions or qtls, which are consistently detected over a range of environments or mapping populations or different parental crosses, are considered “stable or major qtls” and are preferred targets in crop improvement. despite the fact that the present study was carried out by a single cross, the identified common qtls in all the f <dig>  f <dig> and ril populations can be considered as stable or major effect qtls. together with the results of previous studies, seven qtls viz., qph <dig>  , qgl <dig> , qgb <dig> , qlb <dig> , qlb <dig>   <cit> , qasv <dig>   <cit>  and qarm <dig>   <cit>  that are associated with five traits of basmati can be considered as stable qtls. as described by wan et al.  <cit> , the major effect qtls are more likely to behave as stable qtls across multiple environments/genetic backgrounds. these qtls, apart from their suitability in the improvement of the traits concerned, can also serve as potential candidates for fine mapping and also facilitate the development of near-isogenic lines and advanced breeding lines. further, several qtls, each with different environment specificity, can be introgressed into a single genotype to develop phenotypes stable over a range of environments. in fact, in conventional plant breeding, selections are made in target environment and testing is done in multiple diverse environments. this exercise is cumbersome and time consuming. however, use of stable qtls based selection can accelerate the pace of selection process in rice breeding programs.

gene ontology analysis
the enriched go terms and the likely candidate genes of each promising qtl have been studied. in the plant height qtl region flanked by the markers rm <dig> and rm <dig>  as many as  <dig> significant go terms have been identified, of which, metabolic process  and cellular process  terms belonging to the class biological process of the gene ontology were overrepresented. of the  <dig> go terms identified, one gene corresponded to the well known green revolution gene sd <dig>  which also belongs to biological process class  <cit> .

in case of grain length qtl on chromosome  <dig>  only one significant go term, i.e., caspase activity  related to molecular function has been observed. this go term corresponding to four genes, includes three ice-like protease p <dig> domain containing proteins and one zinc finger, lsd1-type domain containing protein. in this qtl region one major gene that codes for putative transmembrane protein  was found to be governing the grain length  <cit> . however, for this gene, no significant hit was available in the go analysis.

in the genomic region governing amylose content, i.e., qac <dig> , nine significant go terms have been identified. however, many of the genes belong to the dna damage or repair mechanism. it may be presumed that these genes probably act as modifiers of the amylose content in addition to other known major genes like granule bound starch synthase .

even though, the region governing the chalkiness i.e., qchk <dig>  is very large, only  <dig> significant go terms were hit. among them, metabolic process , cell  and catalytic activity  are with the highest terms in the classes of biological process, cellular components and molecular function, respectively. a gene similar to chalk <dig> was found in the qtl region of qchk <dig>  which belongs to the class of biological process and codes for vacuolar-processing enzyme   <cit> . however, in the same qtl region, soluble starch synthase  <dig>  under the go term of carbohydrate metabolic process also existed.

prediction of candidate genes in the major qtl regions of basmati rice
several recent publications indicate key intersecting signalling role for auxins and cell wall invertases  during grain filling.  <cit> . in the present study, we have identified an auxin response factor  found to have a nssnp  in which arginine  was replaced by glutamine  at position  <dig> using qteller software .

we were also able to predict candidate gene underlying the qtl cluster consisting of four qtls viz., qgl <dig> , qgb <dig> , qglb <dig> , and qer <dig>  controlling grain appearance trait as vq domain containing protein . in arabidopsis, the vq motif protein iku <dig> has been reported to regulate endosperm growth and seed size along with iku <dig> and min <dig> genes  <cit> . similarly, based on the transcriptome analysis, ap <dig> domain containing protein  and ring e <dig> ligase  showing higher expression during early flowering stage were reported to be involved in regulating grain size in arabidopsis by ohto et al.  <cit>  and in rice by song et al.  <cit> , respectively.

the enzyme involved in starch biosynthesis  could be the plausible candidate gene for the chalkiness qtl region of rm <dig> and rm <dig> as it has been found to have one nssnp  wherein lysine was replaced by asparagine at  <dig> position . interestingly, the same gene was overrepresented in our go analysis as well, providing further evidence that this gene is a probable candidate for the chalkiness. however, its expression is less in the transcriptome analysis compared to the unknown genes.

CONCLUSIONS
basmati rice of the indian subcontinent is a highly distinctive rice because of its unique grain quality, elongation upon cooking and aroma traits. with the advent of high yielding varieties ensuring high farm returns, serious threat to basmati rices was perceived by the breeders pushing them to resort to breeding of varieties of basmati quality in the high yielding background. however, no variety ideally matching the traditional basmati quality could be evolved even after many decades of efforts. genetic investigations have revealed that most of the basmati-specific traits are controlled quantitatively and selections based on phenotype are not reliable enough. the present study was undertaken with the objective of identifying genomic regions or qtls governing the key characters of basmati rice using the cross between traditional basmati variety, basmati <dig> and high yielding non-basmati variety jaya. to the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first attempt to carry out combinational approach of genome-wide mapping and genomics assisted candidate gene prediction to dissect the genetic basis of important agronomic and quality traits of basmati rice.

molecular markers tightly linked to the stable and major qtls can be of potential value in application of marker-assisted selection  of the corresponding traits in rice breeding. the major qtls identified in the present study for economically important traits of basmati can be transferred to high yielding varieties and parents of heterotic hybrids by recombination breeding using the tightly linked markers. being a model cereal crop with all the available genetic and genomic resources, along with the basmati genomic sequence, the understanding of quality qtls would facilitate their positional cloning. by pyramiding the genes from different varieties in a single variety it could be possible to develop a high yielding superior quality rice variety so that it can be available to the common man who dreams to taste speciality rices like basmati.
