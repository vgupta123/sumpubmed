BACKGROUND
protein palmitoylation, or protein s-acylation, is a post-translational modification that adds a palmitate moiety to specific cys residues by a family of proteins named protein acyltransferases  . all pat proteins contain a dhhc domain, a 51-amino acid cys-rich domain with a highly conserved asp-his-his-cys sequence. the other regions of the pats are variable. the zdhhc genes are numerically named zdhhc1- <dig>  <cit> . unlike n-myristoylation or c-prenylation, s-acylation can be reversed by protein palmitoyl thioesterases and acyl protein thioesterases, making it a reversible lipid modification  <cit> .

a number of cellular proteins have been reported to be palmitoylated, which are involved in different cellular activities such as cell signaling, protein trafficking, and cell adhesion . most of the palmitoylated proteins are membrane or peripheral membrane proteins, yet it is noteworthy that some non-membrane associated proteins are also palmitoylated. the importance of protein palmitoylation is manifested in zdhhc deficient mouse models. for example, mice deficient for zdhhc <dig> gene have increased risk of schizophrenia  <cit> . mice with zdhhc <dig> mutation show alopecia, osteoporosis, and amyloidosis  <cit> . a spontaneous mutation of zdhhc <dig> gene in mice leads to hair loss due to defective epidermal homeostasis and hair follicle differentiation  <cit> . we have recently reported that mice null of zdhhc <dig> gene are neonatal lethal with severe heart and eye defects  <cit> .

recent studies have also implicated protein palmitoylation and pats in cancer development. the expression of some zdhhc genes was found altered in various cancer tissues  <cit> . yet how pats participate in cancer development remains unclear. cancer development is driven by the accumulation of gene mutations, especially loss-of-function mutations of tumor suppressors and gain-of-function mutations of oncoproteins  <cit> . however, cell has a protective system, the dna damage response , to monitor dna damage and to repair the damage or eliminate the cells with irreparable dna lesions . upon dna damage, the cell activates the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase-related kinases  such as atm and atr at the dna break sites. a large number of proteins, including γh2ax and brct domain-containing proteins such as brca <dig>  topbp <dig>  and mdc <dig> are recruited to the dna break sites, forming transient nuclear structures named dna damage foci, which are thought to be the centers for signal propagation and dna repair . atm phosphorylates many substrates including smad <dig>  p <dig> and chk <dig>  which eventually cause cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis . thus, a functional ddr is critical for maintaining genome integrity and preventing tumor development. on the other hand, tumor cells usually have disrupted ddr  <cit> . up to date, it is not known whether protein palmitoylation plays a role in dna damage response.

in the present study, we investigated the roles of protein palmitoylation in dna damage response. we found defective ddr including atm activation, p <dig> induction and activation, cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase, and assembly/disassembly of dna damage foci in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts  in the presence of 2-bromopalmitate , a general pat inhibitor . these results were also observed in mefs deficient of zdhhc <dig> gene which encodes a palmitoyltransferase. these findings, for the first time, unravel an important function of pats, in particular zdhhc <dig>  in dna damage response and in atm activation, and provide a possible explanation on how zdhhc proteins participate in tumorigenesis.

methods
mice and cells
mice were housed, bred and used in a specific pathogen free  animal facility at the bio-x institute, shanghai jiao tong university. specifically, no more than five adult mice were housed in one individually ventilated cage with sterilized food, water and woodchip bedding. the animal facility was maintained by professional care takers 7 days a week on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. the study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of shanghai jiao tong university . timed pregnant female mice were euthanized on embryonic e <dig>  by intraperitoneal injection of over-dosed pentobarbital. the time of pregnancy was determined by visual examination of the vaginal plug in the early morning. embryos were dissected and fibroblasts were isolated as described previously  <cit> . the generation and characterization of the zdhhc <dig> knockout mice were described in detail in our previous paper  <cit> . one pregnant c57bl/ <dig> wildtype and three zdhhc <dig> knockout mice were used to obtain all mefs used in this study. the knockout mice were in mixed c57bl/ <dig> and cba background. all efforts were made to minimize the suffering of mice.

RESULTS
most of the zdhhc genes are expressed in mefs
we chose to use primary mefs for this study as most of the immortal cell lines show disrupted dna damage response  <cit> . we first wanted to document which of the  <dig> protein-coding zdhhc genes were expressed in mefs and whether their expression was altered by dna damage. relative quantitative pcr analysis showed that mefs expressed  <dig> zdhhc genes . the mrna for zdhhc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was not detectable in mefs. however, they were found in mouse retina tissues . we then treated mefs with dox, a chemotherapeutic drug that generates double-stranded and single-stranded dna breaks  <cit> , and analyzed the mrna levels of the zdhhc genes. only zdhhc <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mrna showed increase of about twofold, while the rest exhibited no significant change. the expression of a wide spectrum of pats in primary mefs suggests that protein palmitoylation may play important roles in these cells.fig.  <dig> zdhhc gene expression in primary mefs. the expression of each gene in primary mefs without dox treatment was set as  <dig>  and used to calculate the relative abundance of the same gene under dox treatment for  <dig> and 16 h respectively. gapdh and β-actin gene expression were used as internal controls and similar results were obtained. error bars represented standard error means of repeated experiments. notice that zdhhc <dig> is a pseudogene and the expression of zdhhc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were not detected



impaired dna damage-induced p <dig> activation in the presence of 2bp
we then wanted to study the possible roles of protein palmitoylation in dna damage response. since it was unfeasible to simultaneously silence most of the pats with interference rna, we used 2bp, a substrate analog inhibitor that had been widely used to block pat activity . although it may have activities other than palmitoylation inhibition  <cit> , we have shown that 2bp at the concentrations of 50 μm and above was able to inhibit total pat activities in cultured cells  <cit> . indeed, reduced protein palmitoylation was observed in mefs in the presence of 50 μm 2bp . additionally, 2bp showed very modest effects on the expression of a few zdhhc genes .

western blot analysis showed that dox-induced increase in the protein levels of p <dig>  phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig>  and the protein levels of p <dig> and bax, targets of p <dig>  were inhibited in the presence of 2bp . while dox induced a near fivefold increase of phosphorylated p <dig> in normal mefs by 24 h, the increase was only  <dig> -fold or none in cells with  <dig> and 100 μm 2bp pre-treatment, respectively.fig.  <dig> inhibition of palmitoylation by 2bp impaired dna damage-induced p <dig> up-regulation and activation. a western blot analysis showed that 2bp pre-treatment impeded the induction of p <dig> protein expression, p <dig> phosphorylation on ser <dig>  and p <dig> and bax protein levels in response to dox treatment. primary mefs were pre-treated with  <dig> or 100 μm 2bp for 24 h and then stimulated with 1 μm of dox for different periods of time as indicated. the protein levels of p <dig>  p-p <dig>  p <dig>  bax, and actin were determined by western blot analysis. b relative quantitative pcr results showed that 2bp pre-treatment impeded the induction of bax and p <dig>  gene expression, but not much of puma  gene expression. the cells were pre-treated without  or with 50 μm 2bp  for 24 h and followed by 1 μm dox treatment for  <dig>   <dig> and 16 h. the expression of each gene without 2bp and dox treatment was set as  <dig>  and used to compare the expression of the same gene under different stimulated conditions. error bars represented standard error mean of the repeated experiments. asterisk denoted significant difference  between dox alone and 2bp plus dox treated samples



to further confirm these findings, we analyzed mrna levels of p <dig> , bax, and puma  using relative quantitative pcr. we found that dox treatment increased the mrna levels of p <dig> and bax but not puma in mefs . 2bp significantly inhibited the induction of p <dig> and bax expression at the mrna levels in response to dox treatment . since one of the main functions of 2bp was to inhibit pats, these results suggest that protein palmitoylation is required for the optimal induction of p <dig> target genes.

impaired dna damage-induced atm activation in the presence of 2bp
the induction and activation of p <dig> is dependent on atm activation in response to double-stranded dna breaks. we found decreased activation of atm in primary mefs, justified by decreased atm phosphorylation on ser <dig>  in the presence of 2bp. although ser <dig> phosphorylation is not required for atm activation in vivo, it is an autophosphorylation commonly used as an indication of atm activation  <cit> . moreover, we found that 2bp also impeded dna damage-induced smad <dig> activation , another cellular event that requires atm activation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> inhibition of palmitoylation impaired dna damage-induced atm activation. a western blot analysis showed that inhibition of palmitoyltransferase by 2bp led to a decrease in atm phosphorylation on s <dig>  primary mefs were pre-treated with 50 μm 2bp for 24 h followed by 1 μm dox for different periods of time. b quantitation of phosphorylated atm at ser <dig> after being normalized to total atm. asterisk denoted significant difference  between control and 2bp treated cells. c 2bp compromised dna damage-induced smad <dig> activation. cells were treated the same as described in 3a and probed for total and phosphorylated smad1/5/ <dig> and p53



impaired dna damage foci formation in the presence of 2bp
we also looked at the formation of dna damage foci in the presence of 2bp. in normal mefs, dox treatment induced dna damage foci positive for γh2ax, topbp <dig>  and brca <dig>  which are believed to be signal propagation centers as well as dna repair centers . in 2bp-treated cells, the number of foci positive for γh2ax was higher than those in controls, especially at  <dig> and 16 h after dox treatment. these results suggest that 2bp interferes with the assembly/disassembly of the dna damage foci or the dna repair process.fig.  <dig> inhibition of palmitoylation impaired assembly/disassembly of dna damage foci. primary mefs grown on coverslips were pre-treated with 50 μm 2bp for 24 h and then treated with 1 μm dox for different periods of time. the cells were then fixed and immune-stained for h2ax using texas-red conjugated secondary antibodies . b averaged number of foci per cell from multiple repeated experiments and multiple cells per experiment. asterisk denoted significant difference  between compared groups



impaired dna damage-induced cell cycle arrest in the presence of 2bp
dna damage eventually induces apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. since 2bp compromised atm activation and p <dig> induction and activation, we suspected that 2bp might affect dox-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. cell cycle arrest was analyzed by flow cytometry . dox treatment led to an accumulation of cells in the g2/m phase, a decrease in g <dig> phase cells, and a modest decrease in s phase cells in wild type mefs. 2bp pre-treatment impeded dox-induced increase in the percentage of cells arrested in the g2/m phase compared to control cells, without altering the percentage of s phase cells . these results suggest that protein palmitoylation is required for proper g2/m cell cycle arrest in dna damage response. however, we found that 2bp showed some toxicity to mefs at the doses used to inhibit protein palmitoylation, which may reflect a requirement for protein palmitoylation for cell survival, and the combination of 2bp and dox caused more cell death . this prevented us from further testing the role of 2bp-suppressed p <dig> activation in dna damage-induced apoptosis.fig.  <dig> inhibition of palmitoylation impaired dna damage-induced cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase. primary mefs were pre-treated with 50 μm 2bp for 24 h and then treated with 1 μm of dox for 24 h. the cells were harvested, fixed, stained with pi, and analyzed by flow cytometry. a representative micrographs of flow cytometry analysis. b averaged data from multiple experiments. the total number of cells analyzed was set as 100 % and cells at different phase were calculated accordingly



dhhc <dig> deficiency impaired the activation of atm-p53
we have previously reported the identification of one of the pats, encoded by zdhhc <dig> gene. this protein, aph <dig>  was originally identified as a c-abl interacting protein   <cit> . c-abl is involved in dna damage response. in particular, it is required for atm-p <dig> activation . biochemical and genetic studies have shown that at least one protein, phospholamban, a cardiac muscle specific protein, was palmitoylated by aph <dig>  <cit> . in addition, mefs overexpress zdhhc <dig> also showed increased total protein palmitoylation . although dox did not affect the expression of dhhc <dig> at the mrna level , dox induced nuclear translocation of ectopically-expressed dhhc <dig> . we have tried to raise anti-dhhc <dig> antibodies but those antibodies could not recognize endogenous dhhc <dig>  this could be due to the fact that dhhc <dig> is a membrane protein. the lack of anti-dhhc <dig> antibodies prevents us to study the expression, localization, and modification of endogenous dhhc <dig> at the moment. to test whether dhhc <dig> also plays a role in ddr, we treated primary mefs deficient for zdhhc <dig> gene with dox for different periods of time. western blot analysis revealed that zdhhc <dig> deficiency, like inhibition of pats with 2bp, compromised the activation of atm and the induction of p <dig> and its target protein p <dig> .fig.  <dig> zdhhc <dig> deficiency impaired dna damage-induced atm-p <dig> activation. a western blot analysis showed reduced atm phosphorylation at s <dig> in zdhhc16−/− mefs. primary zdhhc16−/− mefs were isolated from zdhhc16−/− mice and treated with 1 μm dox for different periods of time as indicated. b quantitation data on p-atm. asterisk denoted significant difference  between control and 2bp treated cells. c activation and induction of p <dig> and p <dig>  cells were treated the same as above



dhhc <dig> deficiency impaired dna damage foci formation and cell death
we next examined dna damage foci formation in zdhhc <dig> deficient mefs. dox-treated zdhhc16−/− mefs showed similar patterns of foci formation as the 2bp-treated wild type mefs. the number of topbp <dig> or brca <dig> positive foci in zdhhc16−/− mefs was significantly higher than that in wild type cells . we also tested dna damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in zdhhc16−/− and wild type mefs. we found that dox-induced g2/m cell cycle arrest in aph2−/− mefs were not significantly different from those in wild type mefs . however, zdhhc16−/− mefs showed a modest increase in cell survival compared to wild type mefs . these results suggest that zdhhc <dig> plays a role in dna damage-induced cell death.fig.  <dig> zdhhc <dig> deficiency impaired the assembly/disassembly of dna damage foci. wild type and zdhhc16−/− mefs grown on coverslips were treated with 1 μm dox for different periods of time. the cells were then fixed and immuno-stained for topbp <dig>  and brca <dig>  using texas-red conjugated secondary antibodies. the averaged numbers of foci under each condition were counted and averaged and presented at panels
b and d, respectively. e zdhhc <dig> deficiency resulted in an increase in cell survival in response to dox treatment. wt and zdhhc16−/− mefs were treated with  <dig> or 2 μm dox for 24 h. cell survival rates were determined by the wst- <dig> assay. asterisk denoted significant difference between wild type and zdhhc16−/− mefs



discussion
in this study, we showed that 2bp impaired dox-induced dna damage response, in particular the activation of the atm-p <dig> pathway, and led to disrupted activation of the cell cycle checkpoint and dna damage foci dynamics in primary mefs. since 2bp is a general pat inhibitor which also binds palmitoylated proteins, we further showed that the defective dna damage responses observed in 2bp-treated cells were largely replicated in mefs deficient for zdhhc <dig>  one of the  <dig> palmitoyltransferases. collectively our data suggested that protein palmitoylation carried out by pats, in particular by zdhhc <dig>  plays an important role in dna damage response. since ddr, in particular the atm-p <dig> pathway, is the major tumor suppression scheme, our findings also provide a possible explanation on how some zdhhc proteins exert their tumor suppression activities  <cit> .

palmitoylation is a common protein post-translational modification  <cit> . this is also evident by the expression of a variety of zdhhc genes in primary mefs. however, little is known about the specific in vivo functions of each pat. zdhhc <dig> knockout mice showed neonatal lethality with severe cardiac and ocular defects. it appears that one of the substrates of zdhhc <dig> protein in heart is phospholamban, which is largely responsible for cardiac defects observed in zdhhc <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . here we found that cells deficient of zdhhc <dig> also had defective dna damage response, a function that has not been previously ascribed to zdhhc <dig> or any other pats.

how does zdhhc protein facilitate atm activation? since atm is not known to be modified by palmitoylation, zdhhc <dig> and other pats likely regulate the protein that affect atm activation upon dna damage. atm activation requires mrn complex , dna conformational change, and/or dna breaks. the generally agreed major function of palmitoylation is to increase the hydrophobicity of the targeted protein, thus facilitate protein anchoring to membrane and subsequent interaction with other proteins  <cit> . since most of the dna damage foci proteins and signaling molecules are localized in the nucleus, it is more likely that palmitoylation affects the stability and/or complex assembly of the proteins that are involved in dna damage response rather than their membrane association. one such candidate may be histone protein, which has been reported to be palmitoylated  <cit> . palmitoylation of histone proteins may affect the remodeling of chromatin structures, which may in turn affect dna damage foci formation and/or dna conformation, eventually lead to alteration of atm activation and dna repair  <cit> . whether histone proteins are substrates of zdhhc <dig> warrants further investigation.

alternatively, zdhhc <dig> protein may regulate dna damage response through c-abl. zdhhc <dig> was originally identified as a c-abl interacting protein, which was also named aph <dig>  <cit> . c-abl is activated in atm-dependent manner in response to dna damage. activated c-abl helps to up-regulate p <dig> and p <dig> expression and also plays a positive role in maximal atm/atr activation . zdhhc <dig> seems to have a similar role as c-abl in atm activation in dna damage response, yet c-abl is not a substrate of zdhhc <dig>  <cit> . it is possible that zdhhc <dig> may regulate ddr via c-abl in a palmitoylation-independent manner. further exploration on the nature of interaction between zdhhc <dig> and c-abl will help understand how zdhhc <dig> affects dna damage response.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study, for the first time, uncovered a critical role for protein palmitoylation and more specifically zdhhc <dig> in dna damage response. these findings advance our understanding of the regulation of dna damage response and provide a possible explanation on how protein palmitoylation is involved in cancer development. moreover, our results expand the role of palmitoylation on cellular activities and calls for further research on palmitoylated nuclear proteins.
