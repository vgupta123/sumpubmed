BACKGROUND
plants have evolved finely orchestrated mechanisms to regulate their growth in response to the environment as a programmed part of their sessile life style. these mechanisms help them to cope with the  environment at any period of their existence. notably developing seedlings are vulnerable to short-term adverse environments  <cit> . as a result, plants display substantial variability of growth, a phenomenon also known as growth plasticity  <cit> . such plasticity allows plants to optimize their growth and development according to the prevailing environmental conditions, ensuring the best possible strategy to complete their life cycle and propagate. growth plasticity is potentially important for agronomic use as it affects yield and quality in unfavorable environments. plasticity for a trait as growth is largely organized at the molecular level in which epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role  <cit> . chromatin remodeling is part of the epigenetic machinery, next to dna methylation, histone modification and small rna-based mechanisms  <cit> , that is an integral part of overall plant development and is associated with plant responses to biotic  <cit>  and abiotic stress  <cit> .

we have shown previously that the swi/snf2-type atpase encoded by atchr <dig> is involved in the regulation of growth of arabidopsis thaliana upon perceiving abiotic stress, such as drought or higher temperature  <cit> . arabidopsis plants over-expressing atchr <dig> showed growth arrest of normally active primary buds, as well as reduced growth of the primary stem when stressed. without stress, they were indistinguishable from the wild-type. the growth arrest response depended on the severity of the stress applied. another swi/snf2-type atpase, splayed , was shown to be required for resistance against the necrotrophic pathogen botrytis cinerea <cit> , whereas a knockout of the atdrd <dig> atpase gene showed increased susceptibility to fungal pathogen plectosphaerella cucumerina <cit> . the swi/snf2-type atpases are believed to mediate the complex interplay between chromatin remodeling and the enzymes involved in dna and histone modification. this underlines the importance of atp-dependent chromatin remodeling in responses of plants to environmental stress.

in addition, such chromatin modifications play a regulatory role during development  <cit>  in establishing epigenetic states with expression patterns that are tightly regulated in time and space. in animals, such epigenetic states are determined early during the development, while in plants epigenetic mechanisms also operate after embryonic development  <cit> . several chromatin remodeling atpase genes have a role in plant development. the chd3-subfamily atpase pickle  selectively regulates a suite of genes during embryogenesis, seed germination and root development  <cit> . recently, this gene was identified as negative regulator of photomorphogenesis  <cit> . out of four genes of the swi/snf2-subfamily of arabidopsis atpases  <cit> , syd and brm are involved in various, partially overlapping, developmental processes, such as root and floral development or seed maturation  <cit> . the other two members of this subfamily, atchr <dig> and atchr <dig>  have roles in embryo and endosperm development. a nearly lethal atchr12/atchr <dig> double mutant containing weak allele displayed a variety of severe pleiotropic morphological defects, including poor maintenance of shoot and root meristems  <cit> . such atpase-mediated chromatin modification establishes a level of gene regulation that is likely to integrate developmental programs with the response to environmental signals.

it is thought that epigenetic modifications help to establish a buffer against environmental perturbations  <cit>  that results in the phenotypic robustness of the organism. both in drosophila <cit>  and in yeast  <cit>  the deletion of chromatin regulator genes markedly increased the variability of the phenotype studied, indicating that proper chromatin modification may counteract genetic, environmental and/or stochastic perturbations  <cit> .

we here report on the marked impact of over-expression of the atchr <dig> gene on the phenotype of arabidopsis in terms of growth, reaction to adverse environments and genome-wide expression levels. atchr <dig> is a paralog of atchr <dig> <cit>  of which the effects of over-expression were presented earlier  <cit> . over-expression of atchr <dig> results in reduced growth compared to wild-type arabidopsis, but phenotypic details between atchr <dig> and atchr <dig> over-expression are notably different, showing sub-specialization of these two paralogs. the effect of atchr <dig> over-expression is notably quantitative both in terms of growth phenotype as in terms of gene expression. the over-expression of atchr <dig> increases the variability of growth and expression variability of subsets of genes in populations of identical plants. it emphasizes the important role of chromatin modification in the control of gene expression in plants. based on these results, we propose that accurate and controlled expression of atchr <dig> is required for the stability or robustness of growth. we propose that atchr23-mediated chromatin remodeling could be part of a buffer system in plants that protects against environmentally-induced phenotypic and transcriptional variation  <cit> .

RESULTS
construction arabidopsis mutants with altered atchr <dig> expression
to generate transgenic arabidopsis lines over-expressing the atchr <dig> gene a construct containing 35s camv promoter and genomic sequence of atchr <dig>  from the accession columbia  was used for transformation of wild-type arabidopsis . two single-copy transgenic lines were identified and analyzed in detail: atchr23-4ov and atchr23-5ov. in addition, transgenic lines over-expressing cdna copy of atchr <dig> fused in-frame to the gfp gene under the 35s camv promoter in front  were generated. two separate single-copy transgenic lines were identified and analyzed: g_atchr23-1ov and g_atchr23-3ov. a third type of over-expressing transgenic line was generated by transformation with the cdna copy of atchr <dig> including 5’-utr fused in frame to gfp driven by the native atchr23-promoter . for comparison, two loss-of-function t-dna insertion lines affecting atchr <dig> expression were obtained from the arabidopsis stock center. both knockout lines showed no expression of full length atchr <dig> transcript. the data presented in this paper are from salk_ <dig> that in the remainder of this paper will be designated as atchr <dig>  the other insertion line gave similar results .

over-expression of atchr <dig> reduces the growth of roots and increases phenotypic variation
the growth dynamics of seedlings of the knockout  and over-expressing lines of atchr <dig> was analyzed with the help of a root elongation assay using vertical agar plates described previously  <cit> . stratified seeds of wild-type and mutant plants germinated at approximately the same time and frequency. the lengths of the primary root and hypocotyl, as well as other phenotypic characteristics, were measured repeatedly during development in different environmental conditions. to prevent possibly confounding influences of the environment experienced by the previous generation  <cit> , all comparisons were made using seeds from parental plants  grown at the same time and in the same environment. assays were based on at least  <dig> roots per condition, with at most  <dig> roots  per agar plate and five agar plates per assay.

clearly visible differences between different lines were observed, notably with respect to the length of the root . the differences in root length depended on the environmental conditions applied. when grown at 23°c under long-day conditions, roots of the two atchr23-ov mutants were considerably shorter than those of columbia wild-type . data is summarized in table  <dig>  the average length of the roots of 8-day-old wild-type seedlings was  <dig>  mm, whereas of atchr23-4ov seedlings it was  <dig>  mm  and of atchr23-5ov  <dig>  mm . also up-regulation of atchr <dig> with a cdna copy of the gene  resulted in seedlings with roots  <dig> and  <dig> % shorter than wild-type, whereas the transgenic line with the native promoter showed 11% shorter roots . in such assays, the variation in the root length was considerable, with coefficients of variation  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for over-expressing lines, whereas for wild-type it was  <dig>  . the variation of over-expressing mutants was significantly higher than in the wild-type . these data show that upon over-expression of atchr <dig>  roots become not only significantly shorter, but also more variable and less uniform. in contrast, the knockout mutant atchr <dig> develops roots that are only slightly longer than those of the wild-type . in populations of  <dig> seedlings, this difference was not statistically significant. these root growth differences between the various atchr <dig> mutants and the wild-type were consistently observed in several seed stocks that were produced in various growing conditions, greenhouse or growing chambers. moreover, similar differences and variability patterns in root length were observed in seedlings grown at 18°c and 25°c .

the variability in the phenotypic assays was assessed in more detail by analysis of the frequency distributions of the length data . the frequency distribution of the root lengths shows that the distribution is shifted to shorter roots when atchr <dig> is over-expressed , but still quite a number of individual seedlings have roots as long as the wild-type . also for the distribution of the hypocotyl length, the variation is larger in populations of over-expressing seedlings than in the wild-type . in view of all experimental efforts to standardize the environment in the phenotypic assays, we think the variation between individuals of over-expressing lines is likely to have a molecular and/or functional basis.

to associate the growth arrest phenotypes with the level of atchr <dig> mrna, the amount of atchr <dig> mrna was determined in pools of  seedlings with the help of qrt-pcr. the quantitative results are summarized in table  <dig>  a two-fold increase in atchr <dig> mrna  is observed in chr23:g_atchr23ov. this is apparently sufficient for the growth arrest phenotype to become detectable. higher levels of mrna tend to make the phenotype more pronounced, without however a clear correlation between the level of up-regulation and the length of the root. such an association indicates a complex interplay of interactions between steady-state mrna levels and the penetrance of the root length phenotype. the lack of correlation between root length and the level of atchr <dig> expression was also confirmed in individual seedlings of wild-type and mutant  .

the reduction in root growth is due to reduced cell elongation
to determine whether the reduction of root length is due to reduced cell division or reduced cell elongation, we analyzed the size of the meristematic and elongation zone of 6-day-old seedlings. atchr23-4ov roots exhibited a normal cellular patterning compared to the wild-type . for meristem we measured both the length of the meristematic zone and the number of meristematic cortex cells. none of them differ between wild-type and mutant roots . to further assess the role of cell division, we also used the cell g2-m phase cycle marker pcycb1;1:cycb1;1-gus  <cit> . no clear difference in the pattern  and number of gus-positive cells was observed between the wild-type and the over-expressing mutant . this is consistent with meristem size of wild-type and mutant . on the other hand, the mutant showed a significantly shortened  elongation zone relative to the wild-type as well as reduced length  of the fully elongated cells . taken together, these results indicate that the major effect of atchr <dig> up-regulation in the root is the reduction of cell elongation.

over-expression of atchr <dig> results in smaller seedlings and smaller plantlets
analyses of two atchr23-ov lines demonstrate that over-expression of atchr <dig> also resulted in overall reduced seedling and plant growth . over-expressing lines showed reduced growth of the cotyledon  and hypocotyl . the mean cotyledon area was reduced from  <dig>  mm <dig> in the wild-type to  <dig>  mm <dig> in atchr23-4ov  and to  <dig>  mm <dig> in atchr23-5ov . the length of the hypocotyls was determined from seedlings grown at 25°c or 28°c. the latter temperature is known to induce considerable hypocotyl elongation  <cit> . the average hypocotyl length of 25°c-grown 8-day-old seedlings of over-expressing lines was reduced to  <dig>  mm  compared to  <dig>  mm of the wild-type, while the length of the hypocotyl of the knockout did not differ significantly from the wild-type. such differences become more obvious at 28°c . both temperatures show that up-regulation of atchr <dig> leads to a significant overall reduction in the growth of seedlings. the increased growth variability of mutants cotyledon and hypocotyl was not significant .

to determine if and how the effects on plant size due to atchr <dig> over-expression generate phenotypic changes further in development, two parameters for vegetative growth were measured in soil-grown plants: the leaf area and the diameter of the rosette. both parameters were determined from digital images of  <dig> soil-grown plants. the average surface area of the first rosette leaf of the wild-type was  <dig>  mm <dig>  this was reduced to  <dig>  mm <dig> in atchr23-4ov and to  <dig>  mm <dig> in atchr23-5ov, so over-expressing lines have up to 15% smaller leaves than the wild-type . the knockout line had slightly larger leaves , but again this difference was not statistically significant in the experimental set-up chosen. similar growth differences were observed for the third rosette leaf . leaves of over-expressing mutants also showed significantly increased growth variability relative to wild-type . furthermore, the average rosette diameter of 4-week-old over-expressing mutants was reduced in size . while the wild-type rosette diameter was  <dig>  mm, it was  <dig>  mm in atchr23-4ov and  <dig>  mm in atchr23-5ov. compared to the wild-type it represents 20% and 12% reduction in the size of the rosette in the mutants, respectively. it shows that also during vegetative development plants over-expressing atchr <dig> tend to stay smaller than the wild-type.

light conditions determine the growth characteristics of over-expressing lines
as light is a crucial environmental factor affecting plant growth  <cit> , we evaluated the growth dynamics of the various atchr <dig> expression variants under different light regimes. in continuous light, all atchr <dig> mutants confirm the pattern of root length as presented above for long-day conditions. over-expressing lines have a significantly reduced root length relative to the wild-type, whereas the knockout tends to have  longer roots . in the dark, however, none of the lines significantly differed in root length from that of wild-type . in the dark, root growth is known to be significantly reduced  <cit> , while the hypocotyl is known to elongate  more than in the light  <cit> . establishing further reductions in root length in such an environment is therefore less reliable. however, also the length of the hypocotyl of seedlings grown in the dark at either 23°c or 28°c  was not different from the wild-type. also at short day conditions , the length of neither roots nor hypocotyls of mutants could be distinguished from the wild-type. one possible cause for the lack of the phenotype in dark and short-day could be the instabilities of atchr <dig> mrna over-expression. however, quantitative expression analysis of atchr <dig> in dark and short-day grown seedlings confirmed the same level of up-regulation relative to wild-type as in long-day . the lack of phenotype in dark and short-day grown mutants cannot be therefore explained by reduced levels of atchr <dig> over-expression. these results show that light markedly influences the impact of modified atchr <dig> expression on the growth dynamics of arabidopsis seedlings: sufficient  light is required to establish the atchr23-mediated growth phenotype.

abiotic stress magnifies the impact of atchr <dig> over-expression
the impact of modified atchr <dig> expression is also apparent in environmental stress. seedlings were assayed under abiotic stress conditions on agar plates containing 75 mm nacl  or 200 mm mannitol . both stresses had, as expected, a clear negative impact on root growth. the average length of the roots of wild-type seedlings in an environment with salt stress was  <dig>  mm  and in osmotic stress  <dig>  mm , whereas without such stress the length was  <dig>  mm . this shows that salt stress reduces the root length of the wild-type by 24% and osmotic stress by 20%. the over-expressing mutants atchr23-4ov and atchr23-5ov respond to salt by 32% and 36% reduction of root length, respectively . in osmotic stress, this reduction was 29% and 31%, respectively . similar results were obtained with the lines over-expressing atchr <dig> cdna copy . in contrast, the knockout line atchr <dig> has slightly longer roots than the wild-type, but only in osmotic stress . these data indicate that the atchr <dig> over-expressing lines respond to stress conditions by stronger growth arrest of the root length than the wild-type. a non-parametric factor analysis showed highly significant  effects of both genotype and stress treatment on root length, and significant  effects of genotype x treatment interaction on root length, in all mutant lines except for knockout line at osmotic stress . the same is observed in further vegetative development. after applying salt stress by watering two-week-old plants with 100 mm nacl twice in 3 days, the rosette diameter of soil-grown plants  was measured. the rosette diameter of wild-type without stress was  <dig>  mm <dig> whereas after stress, it was  <dig>  mm <dig>  which is a reduction of 11%. the atchr23-4ov plants respond to salt stress by two-fold higher  reduction of the rosette diameter: from  <dig>  mm <dig> to  <dig>  mm <dig> . the non-parametric factor analysis showed highly significant  effects of both genotype and treatment on rosette diameter, however the effect of genotype x treatment interaction was not significant . it shows that abiotic stress magnifies the effect of atchr <dig> over-expression on the seedlings growth and that the effect extends beyond the seedling stage.

genome-wide rnaseq analysis demonstrates increased variability of gene expression upon atchr <dig> over-expression
the growth phenotype conferred by atchr <dig> over-expression was evaluated by rna sequencing. two biological replicates of pooled eight-day-old seedlings of atchr23-4ov and the wild-type  grown at 23°c in long-day  and short-day  photoperiods were evaluated. for each of the eight samples, more than  <dig> million reads were generated. given the experimental set-up, expression differences associated with the reduced growth phenotype were expected between the over-expressing line in long-day conditions relative to all other samples.

differential expression analysis using deseq  <cit>  or cuffdiff  <cit>  resulted in lists of potentially differentially expressed  genes. however, in additional biological replicates many of these could not be confirmed. from  <dig> genes identified by deseq as potentionally de in long-day mutant ,  <dig> genes were analyzed by qrt-pcr and  <dig> were confirmed as differentially expressed . we concluded that identified de genes cannot be biologically validated. further analyses therefore focused on the apparent variation in gene expression. comparison of the expression values expressed as summed fragments per kilobase of transcript  per million mapped reads  of replicates r <dig> and r <dig> for each sample showed the pearson’s correlation coefficients above  <dig>  , except for the only sample in which the growth phenotype was present: atchr <dig> over-expression in long-day conditions. in this case the data are much more disperse from the line of best fit and the pearson’s correlation coefficient is just above  <dig>  . in order to assess the larger between-replicate expression variability in mutant long-day, we calculated for all genes the absolute differences between the log <dig> expression level in the two replicates. the larger expression difference shown by the top 1% of the genes in wild-type  was taken as cut-off for variability and used to select the number  of the genes in all other samples that showed variability higher than specified cut-off. this threshold was equivalent to an expression difference of about  <dig>  fold on the normal scale. in the scatter plots of genome-wide gene expression, these genes are depicted in red .

in long-day conditions, the atchr <dig> over-expressing mutant has no less than  <dig> genes with larger variation . of these,  <dig> genes were also variable in wild-type . this shows that atchr <dig> over-expression increases the expression variability of a considerable subgroup of genes compared to the wild-type. in contrast, in short-day conditions,  <dig> genes were identified as variable in the wild-type, whereas  <dig> genes were identified in the mutant line, of which  <dig> were shared . the larger subgroup of variable genes is therefore associated with the higher over-expression of atchr <dig> observed in long-day conditions. this may point to a causal relationship between atchr <dig> over-expression and increased variability of gene expression. the  <dig> long-day variable genes shared between the wild-type and the mutant are less correlated between the two replicates of atchr <dig> over-expressing mutant  relative to the wild-type  . it indicates that the expression of genes which are already noisy in natural conditions  become even more noisy when atchr <dig> is over-expressed.

to evaluate the function of the genes with higher variation in gene expression when atchr <dig> is over-expressed, gene ontology  analysis was performed. for this, the subset of  <dig> genes  was selected that had at least 3-fold expression difference between the two biological replicates. genes were classified using the classification superviewer  <cit>  as being over- or under-represented. the main results are summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  biological process subcategories that were over-represented include responses to stress, stress stimuli and developmental processes, in addition to other biological processes. this is in good agreement with the phenotypic observations presented above.

atchr <dig> over-expression enlarges differences in gene expression among individuals for selected subsets of genes
to address the impact of variation on gene expression in individual seedlings, eight genes were selected for additional analyses. four genes were randomly selected from the list of atchr23-4ov variable genes at long-day conditions. in addition four genes were randomly selected that were identified as not variable . details of these genes are given in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the expression of these eight genes was analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr in six individual seedlings of over-expressing mutants and the wild-type grown at long-day conditions. box plots summarizing these data show considerably more variation in expression among individual seedlings of the various mutants compared to the wild-type for the four variable genes . in contrast, none of the genes selected for lack of variation showed such a large expression variability between individual seedlings in any of line tested . in individual seedlings different from seedlings analyzed in figure  <dig> additional three variable  and three not variable genes  were analyzed. for all of them, except for at3g <dig>  the variability as detected by rnaseq was confirmed. although based on limited number of individuals these data show that the increased variation of gene expression of distinct subset of genes is also apparent in individual seedlings. this emphasizes the importance of studying the expression pattern in individual plants. for direct biological proof of increased expression variation in atchr <dig> over-expressing mutant more genes should be tested, preferably by extensive rnaseq analysis of a larger number of individual seedlings.

discussion
previously, we have presented detailed analyses of the over-expression of atchr <dig> <cit> . atchr <dig> is a paralog of atchr23: the two genes are very similar in  sequence and are thought to be result of recent gene duplication in arabidopsis  <cit> . yet, their expression patterns are different in spatial and quantitative terms  <cit>  and the results presented here show that over-expression of these two genes have different impact on the growth parameters of arabidopsis. over-expression of atchr <dig> had not the phenotypic effects here documented for atchr <dig> over-expression. under normal environmental conditions, the phenotype of the atchr <dig> mutant cannot be distinguished from the wild-type. however, exposing the atchr <dig> over-expressing mutant to mild stress conditions led to growth arrest of normally active primary buds and reduced growth of the primary stem. it demonstrated that chromatin remodeling-associated growth arrest is priming the plants for growth arrest upon actual stress after the transition to reproductive development  <cit> .

atchr <dig> over-expression affects the growth of seedlings and the vegetative rosette. as the two atpases affect plant growth in different ways at different stages of development, these two genes present a clear and not-so-common example in arabidopsis of sub-functionalization of very similar genes after gene duplication  <cit> . in the genome of crops as potato and tomato, only a single gene instead of two paralogs is present  <cit> . this single ortholog is supposed to combine the function of both atchr <dig> and atchr <dig> in the environmental growth response of such crops. if confirmed in future experiments it could open a new possibility to improve the environmental growth response of agriculturally relevant crops.

over-expression rather than loss-of-function is required to observe the growth phenotype
the atchr <dig> loss-of-function mutant did not show any visible phenotype, neither did the equivalent atchr <dig> loss-of-function mutant. the atchr12/atchr <dig> double knockouts fail to initiate root and shoot meristems and are embryo lethal . a barely viable double mutant containing weak knockout alleles showed severe defects in the maintenance of stem cells, extremely delayed development, bushy appearance, floral organ aberrations and substantially shortened roots  <cit> . the short roots of such double knockouts had significantly reduced cell division and other defects in meristem organization  <cit> . it suggests that in embryo and endosperm development, these two paralogous genes seem to be redundant  <cit> . in contrast to the phenotypic impact of the weak double knockout, atchr <dig> over-expression is not associated with any morphological effect on the root meristem . over-expression correlates with a shorter root elongation zone and a reduced hypocotyl and cotyledon growth. the post-embryonic growth of these organs is mostly the result of controlled cell elongation and does not involve significant cell divisions  <cit> . therefore, atchr <dig> over-expression exerts  impact on cell expansion rather than on cell division. the phenotype of the weak double knockout was accompanied by the changes in the expression of several meristem marker genes  and several cell cycle genes  <cit> . none of these genes was identified as differentially expressed and/or variable in the rnaseq analysis of the atchr <dig> over-expression phenotype here presented.

over-expression accomplished by either the native or the much stronger camv 35s promoter resulted in the same growth phenotype. a relatively small fold up-regulation of about  <dig>  is apparently sufficient and no clear correlation between fold up-regulation and root length reduction is evident . this lack of dose dependency of up-regulation indicates that other limiting factors are likely to be involved. swi/snf <dig> atpases function in the context of protein complexes  <cit>  and one of the participants of such a complex may become limiting. the larger amount of atchr <dig> may be in competition with such a factor, or drains it from such complexes. if so, the over-expression phenotype would represent an on/off case and allow for more fine-grained analysis of the detailed role of atchr <dig> in growth regulation than the analyses of knockouts  <cit> . such severe effects from small folds of up-regulation are rather difficult to study, but especially in a complex phenotype as vegetative development, such subtle effects may be more the rule than the exception  <cit> . several other examples are known where relatively small fold over-expression results in clear phenotypic effects  <cit> .

atchr <dig> function needs long-day light condition
the growth phenotype of atchr <dig> over-expression is only apparent in  light. its function or the function of  direct partners must therefore be photoperiod-dependent. photoperiodicity is one of the most significant and complex of interactions between plants and their environment. it is the major stimulus that plants use to detect seasons  <cit> . a well-known response to the photoperiod is flowering, but it also affects seed germination, leaf formation rate, leaf size and dry matter production  <cit> . the lack of a clear phenotype in dark and short-day condition could result from dark-induced proteolytic degradation of either atchr <dig> or atchr <dig> targets. an example of such a regulation is the transcriptional regulator constans  that promotes flowering of arabidopsis thaliana under long summer days, but not under short winter days  <cit> . more detailed analyses of atchr <dig> will be required to assess whether protein stability plays a role in the regulation of and/or by atchr <dig>  conversely, the putative target genes of atchr <dig> may be light regulated and the atchr <dig> remodeling complex contributes to the fine-tuning of this regulation. in view of the reaction of the various plant lines to environmental stress , light or light duration may become perceived as stress.

over-expression of atchr <dig> increases variability of growth and gene expression
the length of the root  in populations of seedlings behaves as a typical quantitative trait: it has a frequency distribution around a population average of in this case genetically identical plants. over-expression of atchr <dig> shifts the distribution to an average of shorter roots  and hypocotyls . such a continuous distribution indicates a polygenic trait rather than a phenotype controlled by a single locus and/or the involvement of the environment in which epigenetic processes are believed to play an important role  <cit> . the frequency distributions tend to overlap and when considered on an individual basis, some over-expressing seedlings are individuals with growth comparable with individual wild-type seedlings . in the individual case, over-expression of atchr <dig> may not necessary result in reduced growth. this indicates that over-expression does not have inhibitory effect on growth per se. upon over-expression, the mutant seedlings show a more broad distribution of growth parameters than the wild-type . therefore, atchr <dig> over-expression increases the within-population variability of growth, best expressed as coefficient of variation  of growth.

in long-day conditions, atchr <dig> over-expression associates with increased variability of gene expression between biological replicates. it is tempting to assume a causal relationship between these two associated phenomena. although the larger variation could originate from environmental factors and/or the biological material used , extreme care was taken to exclude interference of such experimental factors. light intensity, temperature, humidity were carefully controlled and monitored; wild-type and mutant seedlings were without exception grown at the same time and the same conditions; rna samples were isolated simultaneously and rna handling procedures were synchronized as much as possible. moreover, the variability of the same over-expressing line in short-day conditions was similar to that of the wild-type.

the apparent effect of atchr <dig> over-expression on increasing expression variability is not unknown in other biological systems. inter-individual differences in gene expression is observed in many organisms, including human, mice, fish and yeast  <cit> . also in plants, considerable variability of gene expression can occur between genetically identical individuals in identical environments. gene expression can differ seemingly randomly in amplitude, frequency and timing between genetically identical cells. such stochasticity of gene expression is nongenetic or epigenetic in nature and thought to be an intrinsic property of gene expression itself: stochastic noise  <cit> . the  <dig> genes identified as variable in both the wild-type and the over-expressing mutant could represent intrinsically variable or noisy genes in the tissues and conditions examined. because atchr <dig> over-expression makes intrinsically variable genes more variable, the atchr <dig> remodeling complex could be involved in tuning the noise levels of variable genes. stochastic noise can be beneficial, e.g. for survival in fluctuating stressful environment  <cit> , but in general it is considered to decrease fitness or interfere with development  <cit> .

chromatin-related events are thought to be a component of the regulation of the stochastic noise in gene expression. for example, in yeast, deletion of individual components of chromatin remodeling complexes such as swi/snf increased the expression fluctuation from the pho <dig> promoter significantly  <cit>  and variable genes are distinctly regulated by chromatin modifiers  <cit> . in most biological systems known today, the intrinsic variability of expression has to be controlled or buffered  <cit>  to ensure optimal development and growth. the ability to buffer variations generated by molecular noise, or environmental fluctuations is termed robustness  <cit> . it is suggested that the expression of genes with an essential role in development or differentiation is highly robust  <cit> , whereas expression of stress-responsive genes tends to be much more variable between cells and individuals  <cit> . the latter suggestion is in agreement with the significant enrichment for stress and stress stimuli responsive genes in the go analyses of genes that are highly variable between the two replicates of the atchr <dig> over-expressing line grown in long-day conditions .

the putative perils of pooling
the best way of rnaseq analysis is still being discussed  <cit>  and may depend on both biological and statistical issues, such as sampling, pooling, pooling design, the distribution of  variation and others  <cit> . accounting for biological variation in gene expression is important for reliable and biologically relevant differential expression analysis  <cit> . large variation of the expression of subset of genes between the individual seedlings in pools  could for example result in poor reproducibility between data from different pools.

we have here presented an rnaseq data analysis that is focussing on the variability of gene expression as the topic-of-interest. independent validation by qrt-pcr showed the validity of the approach developed, although more advanced statistics may distill more understanding from the rnaseq data here presented. this data is based on pools of genetically identical seedlings that however may show highly variable gene expression. such between-individual variation in gene expression did not yet get too much attention, but the depth of the new sequencing technologies could provide approaches to circumvent this limitation  <cit> . in fact, also the analysis of a single whole seedling concerns a pool of various tissues in different developmental stages that may have differences in gene expression. in the future, large-scale single cell transcriptomics may resolve such complexities  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that in transgenic arabidopsis, the over-expression of the swi/snf2-type atpase atchr <dig> increases the variability of growth and the variability of expression of a distinct subset of genes in populations of genetically identical plants. these results suggest that accurate and controlled expression of atchr <dig> contributes to more stable or robust gene expression that results in a more uniform growth phenotype. based on the phenotypic and expression data here presented we propose that the atchr <dig> remodeling complexes could be a component of a buffering system of gene expression in plants. if that system of buffering is disrupted by over-expression of atchr <dig>  downstream genes become more variable and compromise the expression of other genes in ways that result in the reduced growth phenotype here documented. phenotypic robustness influences all parameters important for plant growth, yield and quality. the findings presented here will help to better understand and use chromatin remodeling genes as exponents of a potential buffer of phenotypic and transcriptional variation, particularly in conditions of changing environments.
