BACKGROUND
orchids, belonging to the family orchidaceae, one of the largest and most evolved families among flowering plants  <cit>  have a wide variety of attractive shapes and colours, long flowering life and availability throughout the year. this contributes to the economic importance of the orchid industry in malaysia, singapore, thailand, china, netherlands, hawaii and continental usa  <cit> , but to meet consumer demands continuous novel flower colours and shapes are expected and very desirable to the horticultural industry. however development of new varieties of orchids with different colours and shapes is limited by the long breeding time required . given these limitations, the development of time and cost effective approaches for manipulation of orchid flower colour and shape is needed.

factors that determine flower colour include secondary metabolites, ph value, metal ions, flavonoid co-pigments, environmental temperature and morphology of the epidermal cells  <cit> . in this study, we focused on the morphology of the epidermal cells. epidermal cells are the first point of contact with both biotic and abiotic environments. several types of flower epidermal cell shape have been characterised, for instance, conical, flat or pointed . together with flower shape, cell shape influences temperature and light capture of plant surfaces, and thus can affect flower colour  <cit> . for example, it has been suggested that a conical cell shape could enhance light absorption by the pigments by increasing the amount of incident light that enters the epidermal cells .

plant physiology, including cell shape, is genetically controlled. myb transcription factors regulate plant development and secondary metabolism, light and hormone signalling, cell morphogenesis and defence and stress responses  <cit> . most of the plant myb transcription factors belong to the r2r <dig> subfamily   <cit> , which are similar to r <dig> and r <dig> repeats of the animal c-myb proteins . r2r <dig> myb subfamily members have a myb domain which is constituted by two imperfect repeats of approximately 50– <dig> amino acids. each repeat possesses three regularly spaced tryptophan residues that encode three α-helices with the second and third helix forming a helix–turn–helix conformation to bind to the target dna . however, in some exceptions a phenylalanine residue replaces the first tryptophan in the r <dig> repeat  <cit> . the atmyb r2r3-type myb transcription factors have been categorised into  <dig> subgroups according to conserved amino-acid sequence motifs present at the carboxyterminal of the myb domain  <cit> . in this study, we focused on subgroup  <dig>  that is represented by the genes, ammixta, atmyb <dig> and phmyb <dig>  reported to control cell differentiation in antirrhinum majus, arabidopsis thaliana and petunia hybrida respectively and to activate anthocyanin biosynthetic gene expression  <cit> . several of the r2r <dig> myb subgroup  <dig> members have further been associated with cell shape development including: ammybml1-induced production of both trichomes and conical cells in floral tissues  <cit> ; ammybml <dig> extending the growth of conical petal epidermal cells  <cit> ; ammybml <dig> enhancing cellular out-growth from the epidermis of all aerial organs  <cit>  and the mixta-related r2r <dig> myb gene of thalictrum thalictroides promoting conical cell growth in the petal and carpel epidermal cells  <cit> .

a number of approaches have been used for the improvement of flower quality and quantity with many successful examples using gene silencing  in plants  <cit> . while rnai modification has been widely applied via transgenic  <cit>  and virus-based  methods  <cit> , agroinfiltration  <cit>  and the direct mechanical inoculation of dsrna  <cit> , have also been successful in inducing gene silencing. the direct application of dsrna is attractive as a relatively rapid and low cost method compared to plant transformation, therefore, this approach was selected here to study the effect of silencing a myb transcription factor during the development of orchid flowers. the aims of this study were first to describe the flower development and epidermal cell shape and patterns in d. hybrida, to identify myb gene sequences involved in cell shape development of d. hybrida and thirdly to develop a simple and rapid approach to modify orchid flower cell shape using d. hybrida as a study model. we first characterised flower bud development in the dendrobium hybrid into seven stages then used scanning electron microscopy to determine adaxial epidermal cell patterns in the flower perianth. partial r2r3-myb gene sequences were isolated from d. hybrida and were used in phylogenetic analysis to identify those that clustered with myb sequences that are known to be involved in cell shape development. direct application of dsrna from the 3’ region of a selected floral specific cdna to developing orchid flower buds resulted in altered flower epidermal cell shape. this report demonstrates the use of a simple approach using direct application of dsrna to study the role of a transcription factor involved in regulation of flower development in orchid.

RESULTS
isolation and phylogenetic analysis of r2r <dig> myb sequences from d. hybrida
thirty-two partial sequences  amplified from d. hybrida with degenerate myb primers were identified to belong to the r2r3-myb gene family based on the presence of conserved amino acids and two  <dig> amino acid imperfect repeat regions  <cit>  . the r <dig> repeat has three regularly spaced tryptophan residues and the r <dig> repeat includes two tryptophan and one phenylalanine residue  as described by stracke et al.  <cit> . together the r <dig> and r <dig> domains encode three α-helices with the second and third helix forming a helix–turn–helix dna binding domain.fig.  <dig> alignment of putative amino acid sequences from  <dig> d. hybrida r2r3-myb clones. alignments were with dwmyb1: dendrobium sp. xmw-2002- <dig> myb  <dig> . the bar above the alignment indicates the r <dig> and r <dig> domains, underlined in grey and black, respectively. the majority consensus sequences are highlighted and the consensus of each amino acid is shown below the alignment. the region of r2r <dig> domains of d. hybrida sequences is defined according to dwmyb1: dendrobium sp. xmw-2002- <dig> myb  <dig> . arrows indicate the conserved regularly spaced three tryptophan residues in the r <dig> repeat and the two tryptophan and the phenylalanine residue in the r <dig> repeat



phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> partial putative r2r3-myb translated amino acid sequences from d. hybrida with myb proteins from other plants, formed  <dig> subgroups with the myb translated proteins from d. hybrida clustered into six subgroups. i.e., subgroups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . subsequently, a full length cdna  was amplified from d. hybrida flower rna using the partial r2r <dig> myb sequence that is monophyletic with ammixta and the translated full length sequence used for phylogenetic analysis, that grouped it together with dwmyb <dig> and dcmybml <dig>  whilst its sister group contained ammixta and ammybml <dig> . full length cdna sequence analysis revealed that dhmyb <dig> cdna shares 97 % identity with the dendrobium sp. xmw-2002- <dig> myb <dig>  mrna, complete cds and 73 % identity with the dendrobium crumenatum mybml <dig> mrna, complete cds. amino acid alignment of the dhmyb <dig> with other myb sequences from subgroup  <dig>  revealed high sequence similarity within the r2r <dig> domain at the n-terminus  as shown in fig.  <dig>  alignment of the translated full length dhmyb <dig> sequence together with those of mybs in subgroup  <dig>  showed high sequence similarity within the r2r <dig> domain at the n-terminus and the presence of the motif aqwesarxxaexrlxres, previously described by stracke et al.  <cit>  within the c-terminal domain.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of amino acid sequences of dhmyb <dig> and r2r3-myb proteins from subgroup  <dig>  all amino acid sequences were for the full length of the coding sequences. ammixta , mixta-like myb gene ammybml <dig> , ammybml <dig>  and ammybml <dig>  from antirrhinum majus; atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig>  from arabidopsis thaliana; phmyb <dig>  from petunia hybrida; dcmybml <dig>  from dendrobium crumenatum, dwmyb <dig>  from dendrobium sp.; tfmymml <dig>  from thalictrum filamentosum; mgmybml <dig>  from mimulus guttatus pop-variant im62; dhmyb <dig> from dendrobium hybrid . bootstrap values are indicated at the nodes of the branches . myb  <dig> from pinus pinaster, ppmyb <dig>  was used as an outgroup to root the tree. the scale bar represents  <dig>  substitutions per site

growth and development of d. hybrida floral buds
floral buds from d. hybrida were divided into seven developmental stages from emerged bud until mature bud, based on physical characteristics, in particular size as shown in fig.  <dig>  d. hybrida emerged buds typically took 6 days to reach 5 mm in length; 11 days to reach 10 mm in length; 15 days to reach 15 mm in length, 19 days to reach 20 mm in length; 22 days to reach 25 mm in length; 25 days to reach 30 mm in length; 29 days to reach 35 mm in length; 30 days to reach unfolding of petals and sepals and 32 days to reach anthesis. pollinia from buds with different sizes were examined for meiotic stages. floral buds from stages  <dig> and  <dig> showed premeiotic nuclei, while meiotic prophase at zygotene/early pachytene  were observed in a 16 mm buds , and diades and tretades  were found in a 23 mm bud . we therefore assume that meiosis starts during floral bud stage  <dig> and takes place during bud stages  <dig> to  <dig>  and proceeds normally.fig.  <dig> flower bud developmental stages of d. hybrida. stage  <dig> , immature flower bud with light green surface; stage  <dig> , small sized bud with light green surface; stage  <dig> , medium-small sized bud with green adaxial surface and abaxial surface turning light purple; stage  <dig> , medium sized bud with adaxial surface of perianth turning light purple; stage  <dig> , medium- large bud with green adaxial surface and abaxial surface turning more purple and stage  <dig> , large bud with purplish adaxial and abaxial surface; stage  <dig> , mature bud with dark purple at adaxial and abaxial surface. a bud morphology b buds were opened and separated to show the developmental stage; c column/anther morphology at different developmental stages.  bar = 50 mm,  bar = 1 mm

analysis of the expression levels of the dhmyb <dig> cdna in different floral bud stages
to determine the pattern of dhmyb <dig> gene expression, dhmyb <dig> cdna was quantified by real-time pcr for all floral bud stages . the transcript level of dhmyb <dig> increased gradually from stage  <dig>  to stage  <dig>  and decreased at stage  <dig> . one way anova analysis and multi-comparison analysis  on the average results of three independent experiments showed significant differences in dhmyb <dig> expression from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> . following close examination of the plants treated with dhmyb <dig> dsrna and noting that only labellum cells showed altered phenotypes, the levels of dhmyb <dig> cdna in sepals, petals and labella of bud stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. expression of dhmyb <dig> was generally higher in the labella compared to sepals and petals with the largest difference at stage  <dig> where expression was  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher than in sepals and petals, respectively .fig.  <dig> expression levels of the dhmyb <dig> cdna in floral buds from stages  <dig> to <dig>  the relative expression of dhmyb <dig> cdna was obtained by dividing the average number of dhmyb <dig> transcript copies by the copy number of d. hybrida β-actin  for the same tissue. the lowest transcript level  was then set to a value of  <dig> and subsequently expression levels are reported relative to this number. bars indicate standard error from amplification of  <dig> replicates of dhmyb <dig> cdna samples. asterisks on the top of each bar highlight the differences in dhmyb <dig> expression level according to a tukey hsd comparison test

cell shape of the adaxial epidermis of the perianth of d. hybrida
in order to characterize the shapes of floral adaxial epidermal cells, labella, petals and sepals of d. hybrida flowers at the anthesis stage were examined by scanning electron microscopy. the labellum in d. hybrida was more complex compared to the sepal and petal each of which was divided into two domains: the larger upper domain  <dig> with flattened epidermal cells and the smaller basal domain  <dig> with flattened rectangular or irregular epidermal cells . in contrast, there were seven different types of epidermal cell shapes  on the adaxial surface of the labellum .fig.  <dig> a diagram illustrating various shapes of adaxial epidermal cells in the perianth of d. hybrida. a adaxial surface of petal divided to  <dig> domains. d1: domain 1; d2: domain  <dig>  b adaxial surface of petal domain 1- flattened epidermal cells c adaxial surface of petal domain  <dig> - flattened epidermal cells with rectangular bases d adaxial surface of sepal divided into  <dig> domains. d1: domain 1; d2: domain  <dig>  e adaxial surface of sepal domain  <dig> - flattened epidermal cells f adaxial surface of sepal domain  <dig> - flattened epidermal cells with irregular bases g adaxial surface of labellum divided to  <dig> domains. d1: domain 1; d2: domain 2; d3: domain 3; d4: domain 4; d5: domain 5: d6: domain 6; d7: domain  <dig>  h adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - conical epidermal cells i adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - flattened epidermal cells. j adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - epidermal cells showed a single, central outgrowth of the outer, cuticularised wall. k adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - random cellular outgrowths. l adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - regular striations within the epidermal cells. m adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - flattened epidermal cells with rectangular bases, random conical cells on the surface. n adaxial surface of labellum domain  <dig> - flattened epidermal cells with rectangular bases. adaxial epidermis cell shapes were captured on fresh samples using variable pressure scanning electron microscopy with  <dig> × magnification

d. hybrida buds treated with dhmyb <dig> dsrna were compared to non-treated controls at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> dpt and  <dig> dpt, respectively). while there was no obvious change in phenotype between treated and control flowers, there was a significant  decrease in dhmyb <dig> rna levels of around  <dig> -fold at stage  <dig>  4-fold at stage  <dig> and  <dig> -fold at stage  <dig> .fig.  <dig> gene expression in buds after treatment with dsrna. quantification of expression levels of the dhmyb <dig> from untreated buds and buds treated with dhmyb <dig> dsrna at stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  relative expression of dhmyb <dig> was obtained by dividing the average number of dhmyb <dig> transcript copies by the copy number of d. hybrida β-actin  for the same tissue. the transcript level of dhmyb <dig> rna in stage  <dig> untreated floral buds was then set to a value of  <dig> and subsequently expression levels are relative to this number. bars indicate standard error from triplicate amplification of the dhmyb <dig> cdna samples . transcript levels of dhmyb <dig> gene in treated buds are significantly different from untreated control buds, p <  <dig>

discussion
the myb family of transcription factors are important regulators of biological development, represented by multiple genes within each eukaryotic species, including plants from unicellular algae to multicellular plants  <cit> . with an aim to study if direct application of dsrna of a myb gene family member can affect flower phenotype development, we first identified candidate r2r <dig> myb gene sequences from d. hybrida, and also confirmed this to be a large gene family, with at least  <dig> distinct members. although myb subgoup  <dig> contains several genes of unknown function, for example dendrobium sp. xmw-2002- <dig> myb <dig> and d. crumenatum mybml <dig>  <cit> , this group was selected as the focus for functional study in d. hybrida as some myb subgroup  <dig> family members have been associated with cell shape and pigment development including ammixta  <cit>  and ammybml <dig>  <cit>  and with regulation of cell shape in several plant species for example phmyb <dig> in petunia hybrida  <cit>  and tfmymml <dig> in thalictrum filamentosum  <cit> . however, there are few reports of the expression profile of these genes at different flower developmental stages.

flower development and cell shape in d. hybrida
in order to characterise expression of the dhmyb <dig> in this study, we first characterised stages of flower development, from immature bud to mature bud of d. hybrida into seven stages according to the flower bud length  as has been similarly reported for dendrobium x jaquelyn thomas ‘uniwai prince’   <cit>  and dendrobium sonia ‘earsakul’  <cit> . in addition, we identified the time of meiotic division in d. hybrida as between late stage  <dig> to end of stage  <dig>  with pollen formation estimated to occur at stage  <dig> . we also characterised adaxial epidermal cells of the flower perianth by sem, finding that the petals and sepals each are divided into two distinct domains based on cell shape and size . a previous study with several species of orchid also described various cell types based on cell shape and size, but not in terms of domains within the petals, sepals or labella  <cit> . the presence of only flat epidermal cells in petals and sepals of d. hybrida  is similar to that reported for d. autumn lace, d. betty goto, d. canaliculatum x d. taurinum, d. gouldii and d. lasianthera  <cit> . however, a recent study with phalaenopsis ox red shoes  <cit>  found that the adaxial epdidermal cells of the sepal were conical in shape and those on the labellum were flat, suggesting different species of orchids, such as dendrobium and phalaenopsis, may have different cell shape patterns. the labellum of d. hybrida, was the most complex part of the perianth, in terms of cell morphology, and was characterised into seven distinct domains . a conical cell shape was only observed in the labellum of d. hybrida and the cell shape in the petals and sepals of d. hybrida were apparently unchanged by reducing the expression of dhmyb <dig> 

conical epidermal cells are a common feature of petal tissues and have been reported to influence pollination by insects and birds via changes in surface texture and light reflection and hence, the perception of colour and surface area by pollinators  <cit> . the presence of conical cells in the labellum, and not in the perianth of d. hybrida, thus correlates with a role in attracting pollinators to this part of the flower. in our study, the change in epidermal cell shape could not be perceived by the human naked eye and there was no apparent change in shape or color of the labella of treated compared to control flowers, even though these could be detected as reduction in dhmyb <dig> mrna and altered cell shape under the electron microscope. it is possible, however that the change in flower labellum cell shape, may be perceived by insects, as been reported in petunia for flat-celled mutant lines that were less visited by bees compared to the conical-celled wild type flower  <cit> . gene silencing using vigs for other families of transcription factors, bhlh and mads box, in the orchid phalaenopsis equestris  <cit>  and pesep <dig> and pesep <dig> in phalaenopsis ox red shoes  <cit> , resulted in changes in both cell and flower shape, while also not changing flower color . it was however reported that transient expression by particle bombardment of an r2r <dig> myb transcription factor ogmyb <dig>  from the orchid oncidium gower ramsey, induced the formation of red pigments in the flower labellum  <cit> . in the latter study, the normal expression pattern was found only in petals and sepals, but the rest of the pigment pathway remained active so could be activated when the myb was ectopically expressed in the labellum. thus, not unexpectedly, it appears that several families of transcription factor must work together to result in the shape and colour of floral cells and organs and that changes that are not visible to humans may still have a biological and ecological impact. in addition to its role in attraction of insect pollinators, the unique and special nature of the orchid labellum is an important commercial quality of these plants and the characterization of the different regions, as in the current study, if extended to other species and cultivars of orchid, could be a useful morphometric marker for molecular breeding, similar to the characterization of petal epidermal cells of legume flowers which has been used as a micromorphological marker of different petal identity  <cit> .

dhmyb <dig> is expressed during flower development
in this study we focused on a candidate from the myb <dig> subgroup and observed that dhmyb <dig> expression from immature bud through to mature bud, is consistent with a role in flower development . the maximum observed expression of dhmyb <dig> in the stage  <dig> floral bud, coincides with the fully formed flower at around  <dig> to 7 days before opening . at this stage, further flower development mainly consists of cell expansion and flower opening, thus the expression of dhmyb <dig> may relate to a role in the continued regulation of cell shape during cell expansion as the flower matures. members of the myb <dig> subgroup have been reported to have various roles in flower development, and here we observed that the direct application of dsrna sharing sequence identity with dhmyb <dig>  significantly reduced the level of dhmyb <dig> rna  and resulted in altered cell shape in the orchid flower labellum . the change from  conical shaped cells to flattened cells, is very similar to that reported in the flowers of mixta mutants in anthirrhinum majus  <cit>  and phmyb <dig> mutants in petunia hybrida  <cit> , supporting orthologous roles for dhmyb <dig>  phmyb <dig> and ammixta. the expression pattern of dhmyb <dig> in d. hybrida is comparable with that reported for phmyb1in petunia flowers  <cit>  where the transcript level of the dhmyb <dig> and phmyb <dig> increases gradually with the increasing size of floral bud and peaks when the flower bud is around 70 % of its maximum size. in contrast, the expression patterns reported for ammybml <dig> and ammixta in anthirrhinum majus differ, with the former expressed relatively late, peaking when the corollas of the flowers are just opened and the expression of the latter peaking slightly earlier when the flowers are around half their final size. interestingly, the phylogeny for this group  also places the phmyb <dig> and dhmyb <dig> slightly closer together. the effect of dsrna  on flower cell shape, was only observed in the labella and not the petals or sepals of d. hybrida , thus we suggest that the function of dhmyb <dig> relates to normal cell development of conical shaped cells throughout the maturity of the flower, and which we observed were confined to the labella of d. hybrida, but are found in the petals in both petunia and antirrhinum. this is also supported by the expression pattern of dhmyb <dig> which was higher in the labella compared to the petals and sepals, which lack conical shaped epidermal cells .

direct application of dsrna is a useful approach to study flower developmental gene function
overexpression and rna interference  technology have proven to be useful tools to study the role of myb family proteins during floral development and to improve flower quality and quantity  <cit> . however, in slow growing species such as orchids, stable transformation methods are not practical and thus vigs and other transient expression and gene silencing approaches are more time and cost effective. vigs has been demonstrated as an effective method for gene silencing of mads box transcription factors in phalaenopsis orchids  <cit>  and to have up to  <dig>  % silencing efficiency  <cit> . a recent study in dendrobium sonia  <cit>  demonstrated the utility of an agroinfiltration rnai approach to assay gene function in floral tissue of orchids. in our study, rnai knock down of the expression of dhmyb <dig> using dhmyb <dig> dsrna was able to produce a clear loss of function phenotype  far more rapidly than could have been achieved via transgenic approaches, thus this may have potential for use in biotechnological applications as well as for research. this approach has been used successfully in animal systems such as caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  but in plants previous reports are limited to use for viral resistance, for example in tobacco  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and orchid  <cit> . in the current study, this approach was found to reduce transcript levels of dhmyb <dig> of floral buds in d. hybrida successfully. moreover, mechanical inoculation of rna using bacterially expressed genes is a protocol that is simple and quick when compared with using either the in vitro synthesis of large amounts of rna or the introduction of a transgene into plants. we envision that for some gene candidates, altered phenotypes would also be visible by naked eye, for instance, loss or reduction of pigmentation or changes in organ identity.

CONCLUSIONS
the development of dendrobium hybrida flower buds was characterised into seven stages with meiosis occurring between stages  <dig> to  <dig>  and pollen formation estimated to occur at stage  <dig> . we also characterised adaxial epidermal cells of the flower perianth by sem, finding that the petals and sepals each are divided into two distinct domains based on cell shape and size, while the labella had seven domains. we identified and cloned a full length r2r3-myb cdna sequence, dhmyb <dig>  othologous to myb sequences that are known to be involved in cell shape development and using dhmyb <dig> gene sequences, demonstrated that the direct application of dsrna to developing flower buds can reduce levels of endogenous transcripts in flowers. this leads us to suggest a role for dhmyb <dig> in regulating the conical shape of the labella epidermal cells throughout flower development. this method is relatively rapid and inexpensive compared to vector based genetic transformation. we suggest that direct application of dsrna to flowers can be an alternative method for cell transformation that may be useful for horticulture, in particular with respect to flower modification.
