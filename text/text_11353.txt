BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  are a group of functionally and genetically related bacteria known for the fermentation of sugars to the metabolic end-product, lactic acid  <cit> . lab belong to the order of lactobacillales, which includes the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, oenococcus, pediococcus, streptococcus, among others  <cit> . lab, including lactobacilli, are very diverse and are commonly found in many different environments. lactobacilli are naturally associated with many foods, including fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, wine, milk and meats. in addition, several species of lactobacillus, such as lactobacillus gasseri, are considered to be indigenous to the gastrointestinal tract  and other mucosal surfaces, including the mouth and vagina  <cit> . the lactobacillus genus has been explored for their probiotic potential due to the ability of specific strains to survive passage through the human git and exert benefits to general health and wellness to the host  <cit> . probiotics have been defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host  <cit> . some of these benefits include a positive influence on the normal microbiota present in the git, the competitive exclusion of pathogens, and the stimulation or adjustment of mucosal immunity  <cit> .

lactobacilli can utilize a variety of carbohydrates which reflects the nutrient availability in their respective environments. in many lactobacilli, pts  transporters are the dominant carbohydrate transporters  <cit> . for example, the l. plantarum genome revealed  <dig> pts transporters which correlate with its broad carbohydrate utilization profile  <cit> . analysis of the l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus and l. gasseri genomes further substantiate these observations since they contain a preponderance of pts transporters  <cit> . the pts functions by the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate  to the incoming sugar through a series of sequential steps that involve the different components of the pts. the pts consists of cytoplasmic components, which lack sugar specificity, and membrane-associated enzymes, which are specific for a few sugars, at most. the cytoplasmic components are enzyme i  and histidine-phosphorylatable protein . the membranous component of the pts system, enzyme ii , is made up of three to four subunits: iia, iib, iic and sometimes iid  <cit> .

in reference to the human git, lactobacilli are the predominant species in the ileum  <cit> . the carbohydrate utilization profile of lactobacilli isolated from porcine ileal contents reflects the carbohydrate content of the diet  <cit> . for example, the relative percentage of lactobacilli that can utilize starch increases after weaning, whereas the relative percentage of lactobacilli that can utilize lactose decreases after weaning. carbohydrate transporters, including pts transporters, are among the genes that have been shown to be expressed during git transit of lactobacilli  <cit> . the importance of pts transporters in lactobacillus johnsonii ncc  <dig> has been verified by studying gut persistence in vivo. specifically, expression of a pts transporter annotated as mannose-specific is required for the long-residence phenotype of l. johnsonii ncc  <dig>  <cit> .

genome sequencing of selected lactobacilli has enabled researchers to make additional conclusions about the traits and characteristics of these organisms. in  <dig>  the sequenced genomes of l. gasseri atcc  <dig> and many other lactobacilli were released  <cit> . the currently available annotation of the l. gasseri atcc  <dig> genome describes numerous genes potentially involved in the uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates, yet the specific functions of these genes remain unknown. our objective was to characterize pts transporter functionality in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> using gene knockouts, bioinformatics, comparative carbohydrate utilization assays and transcript expression profiles.

RESULTS
identification of pts-transported carbohydrates
as the most common method of carbohydrate utilization in some lactobacilli  <cit> , the pts transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> were selected for further study. pts transporters require a functional ei to import carbohydrates  <cit> . additionally, some non-pts carbohydrate transporters also require a functional pts system for full transport activity  <cit> . insertional inactivation of ei in l. gasseri was performed to identify the carbohydrates which require a functional pts system for utilization . l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei was only able to utilize  <dig>  of the  <dig> carbohydrates that the parent strain could utilize, indicating that transporters independent of the pts system can import these two carbohydrates. the  <dig> carbohydrates that can be utilized by l. gasseri atcc  <dig> but not by l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei are d-galactose, d-fructose, d-mannose, n-acetylglucosamine, amygdalin, arbutin, esculin ferric citrate, salicin, d-cellobiose, d-lactose, d-saccharose , d-trehalose, amidon , gentiobiose and d-tagatose. these  <dig> carbohydrates are either  imported directly by a pts transporter and/or  imported by a non-pts carbohydrate transporter that requires a functional pts system. examples of non-pts transporters that require a functional pts system to import sugars include lacs  <cit>  and rafp  <cit> . both lacs and rafp have a pts iia-glc domain  fused to a permease domain. the pts iia-glc domain of these proteins is required for full transport activity. all pts iia domains identified in the conserved domain database  <cit>  for l. gasseri atcc  <dig> are a part of pts transporters. additionally, l. gasseri atcc  <dig> does not have homologs to lacs or rafp. consequently, we can confirm that  l. gasseri atcc  <dig> does not have a lacs or rafp, and  l. gasseri atcc  <dig> does not have a pts iia domain fused to a non-pts transporter. while it is still possible that there are unknown pts iia domains that have not been characterized, we conclude that the majority of these  <dig> carbohydrates are imported by pts transporters.

the carbohydrate utilization profiles of l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei::mjm <dig>  l. gasseri adh and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> were determined using api  <dig> ch assays after  <dig> hours incubation. the ability or inability to utilize carbohydrates is represented by "+" or "-", respectively. the superscript indicates the following: a -- there were no differences among the carbohydrate utilization profiles of l. gasseri atcc  <dig> pts 15::mjm <dig>  l. gasseri atcc  <dig> pts 20::mjm <dig>  l. gasseri atcc  <dig> pts 21::mjm <dig> and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> 

pts transporters with specificities for many of these carbohydrates  have not been identified amongst lactobacilli. for several of the other carbohydrates, very few pts transporters have been identified amongst lactobacilli. for example, pts transporters for d-galactose and d-lactose have only been identified in l. casei  <cit> , whereas many other lactobacilli utilize permeases  <cit> . carbohydrates that can be utilized by both l. gasseri atcc  <dig> and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei  can be transported into the cell by non-pts mechanism. the l. gasseri genome encodes two putative permeases with a predicted specificity for glucose  <cit> . a putative sugar abc transporter has also been predicted for maltose  <cit> . the importance of pts transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> was revealed based on the carbohydrate utilization profiles of the wild type and ei knockout strains.

pts transporters in lactobacilli
bioinformatic analysis was used to characterize the pts transporters of the sequenced lactobacilli genomes. in total, eleven different species were analyzed, including lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, l. brevis atcc  <dig>  l. casei atcc  <dig>  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc  <dig>  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc baa- <dig>  l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  l. johnsonii ncc  <dig>  l. plantarum wcfs <dig>  l. reuteri f <dig>  l. sakei ssp. sakei  <dig> k and l. salivarius ssp. salivarius ucc <dig>  a complete pts transporter was defined as having the iia, iib and iic components present in the enzyme ii of the pts. an incomplete pts lacked one or more of these three subunits  <cit> .

complete transporters were defined as having the iia, iib and iic subunits of eii present, and incomplete transporters were defined as lacking at least one subunit.

the number of pts transporters present in a species has been proposed to be due to the adaptation of species to their specific niches  <cit> . species such as l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  l. acidophilus ncfm and l. johnsonii ncc  <dig> all have more pts transporters than most of the other species. these common inhabitants of the git may require a large number of pts transporters to survive in their environment. l. delbrueckii species are commonly used in dairy fermentations, where the nutrient-rich environment has less carbohydrate diversity and has resulted in significant gene loss in respect to carbohydrate utilization  <cit> .

in an effort to characterize pts transporters through bioinformatics, seven different pts families have been differentiated  <cit>  and are available at the transport classification database  <cit> . table  <dig> lists the pts transporter families for all of the complete and incomplete pts transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  two of the three complete pts transporters from the lac family  have no known homologs amongst the  <dig> other lactobacilli analyzed . in addition, pts  <dig>  of which none of the other  <dig> analyzed lactobacilli have a complete homolog, is the only complete pts member of the gat family in l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  there are no members of the gut and asc family amongst the  <dig> complete pts transporters of l. gasseri atcc  <dig> 

the superscripts for the predicted functions indicate the following: a -- homology to characterized pts transporters in other species; b -- homology to pts transporters that are induced by a particular carbohydrate in other species; c -- pts transporters that are induced by a particular carbohydrate in l. gasseri atcc 33323; and d -- characterization in l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  the tcdb family names are categorized as follows:  <dig> a. <dig> -- pts glucose-glucoside ;  <dig> a. <dig> -- pts fructose-mannitol ;  <dig> a. <dig> -- pts lactose-n,n'-diacetylchitobiose-β-glucoside ;  <dig> a. <dig> -- pts galactitol ; and  <dig> a. <dig> -- pts mannose-fructose-sorbose   <cit> .

strain variation
in order to determine the variability of pts transporters within l. gasseri, fifteen complete pts transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> were compared to l. gasseri adh and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> using pcr . pcr products were obtained for all of the fifteen pts transporters when l. gasseri atcc  <dig> was used as the template. there was no visible amplicon for pts  <dig> and  <dig> for either l. gasseri adh or atcc  <dig>  in addition, there was no visible amplicon for pts  <dig> and  <dig> in l. gasseri adh. the pcr of all other pts transporters resulted in a visible product for l. gasseri adh and l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  the pts transporters that are unique to l. gasseri atcc  <dig> amongst sequenced lactobacilli  also appear to be variable within l. gasseri.

the presence or absence of a visible pcr gel product in l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  l. gasseri adh and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> is denoted by "+" or "-", respectively.

recently, draft genomic dna sequences have become publicly available from three l. gasseri strains . bioinformatic analysis of the l. gasseri draft genomes revealed that pts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from l. gasseri atcc  <dig> are not present in all l. gasseri strains whereas the other  <dig> complete pts transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> where also found in l. gasseri 202- <dig>  l. gasseri mv- <dig> and l. gasseri jv-v <dig>  while caution should be used to interpret the draft genomes since they are unfinished, it is interesting to note that pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> were found to be variable amongst l. gasseri using both pcr and bioinformatic approaches.

carbohydrate utilization assays were also used to study different l. gasseri strains in comparison to l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  l. gasseri adh and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> had different carbohydrate utilization profiles when compared to l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  among the l. gasseri strains, only l. gasseri atcc  <dig> was able to grow on amygdalin, arbutin and salicin. both l. gasseri atcc  <dig> and l. gasseri adh were able to grow on amidon , but l. gasseri atcc  <dig> was not able to grow on amidon. also, there were no carbohydrates that were unique to l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  as previously indicated  <cit> , these results demonstrate the potential for gain/loss of carbohydrate utilization genes which results in difficulty in using carbohydrate utilization assays for species identification.

transcript expression profiles
real-time pcr was used to study the transcript expression profiles of the fifteen complete pts transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> in response to fructose , glucose, mannose, cellobiose and sucrose. pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> were annotated as being sucrose-specific and both have adjacent orfs annotated at sucrose-6-phosphate hyrdolase. pts  <dig> was induced  <dig> ±  <dig> fold with sucrose as the sole carbohydrate source, whereas all other pts transporters were induced less than  <dig> fold . the l. acidophilus ncfm pts transporter  induced by sucrose  <cit>  is a homolog of pts  <dig> . in fact, l. johnsonii ncc  <dig> orf  <dig> is also a homolog to pts  <dig> in l. gasseri , and all three strains can utilize sucrose.

in the presence of cellobiose, pts  <dig> was induced  <dig> ±  <dig> fold . all other pts transporters were induced less than  <dig> fold. l. acidophilus ncfm has a homolog to pts  <dig>  and is able to utilize cellobiose. surprisingly, three of the complete pts transporters of l. gasseri atcc  <dig> were annotated as cellobiose-specific , yet none demonstrated inducible expression in the presence of cellobiose. the annotation of pts  <dig> incorrectly indicates a specificity for trehalose, yet pts  <dig> is a homolog for the characterized trehalose pts in l. acidophilus ncfm  <cit> . our results demonstrate the importance of determining pts transcript expression profiles to identify pts transporter specificity rather than relying solely on annotation and bioinformatics.

there were no pts transporters that were significantly induced in the presence of glucose or mannose . the pts transporter for glucose is constitutively expressed in streptococcus mutans  <cit> , s. bovis  <cit> , and lactobacillus casei  <cit> . additionally, no pts transporter was induced by glucose in l. acidophilus ncfm  <cit> . pts  <dig> includes a fused iia and iib domain , in addition to the enzyme iid  subunit which are characteristic of glucose pts transporters  <cit> . in addition, pts  <dig> is a homolog of the characterized glucose/mannose pts transporter in l. casei  <cit> , providing evidence that pts  <dig> may be involved in the transport of glucose. homologs of pts  <dig> are found in all  <dig> of the sequenced lactobacilli genomes we analyzed that contain at least one complete pts transporter. l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei indicates that a non-pts mechanism is able to import glucose as well . while no pts transporter was induced by mannose , pts transporter function is required for the utilization of mannose , suggesting that the glucose permease is unable to transport mannose. since the glucose pts transporter can also transport mannose in some instances  <cit> , and that the pts  <dig> homolog in l. casei atcc  <dig> transports glucose and mannose  <cit> , we predict that pts  <dig> also transports glucose and mannose.

insertional inactivation of pts  <dig>  pts  <dig> and pts 21
in order to confirm the conclusions from bioinformatic and transcript analyses, gene knockouts for pts  <dig> , pts  <dig>  and pts  <dig>  were created. carbohydrate utilization assays were used to characterize mjm <dig>  mjm <dig> and mjm <dig> . no differences were detected among these three knockout strains and the parental strain. the qualitative nature of the carbohydrate utilization assay prevented the ability to characterize these knockout strains.

growth curves were performed with mjm <dig>  mjm <dig>  mjm <dig>  l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  and l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei  . the growth media had sucrose , cellobiose , glucose  or mannose  as the sole carbohydrate. in all four cases, l. gasseri atcc  <dig> ei did not grow and was indistinguishable from the non-inoculated control. growth of mjm <dig> was significantly reduced on sucrose , confirming the bioinformatic and transcript expression profile based prediction. growth of mjm <dig> was significantly reduced on cellobiose , confirming the transcript expression profile based prediction. in regards to glucose, the growth of all four knockout strains was similar to the parental strain . mjm <dig> had a significantly extended lag phase that was approximately  <dig> hours longer than the lag phase observed with the other analyzed strains when mannose was the sole carbohydrate . pts  <dig> and another unidentified pts transporter import mannose.

prediction of l. gasseri atcc  <dig> pts transporter specificities
we have identified  <dig> carbohydrates that require a functional pts system for utilization : galactose, fructose, mannose, n-acetylglucosamine, amygdalin, arbutin, esculin ferric citrate, salicin, cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, starch, gentiobiose and tagatose. the annotations of the complete and incomplete pts transporters are presented in table  <dig>  sucrose induced expression of pts  <dig> , and cellobiose induced expression of pts  <dig> . insertional inactivation of pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> significantly reduced growth on sucrose  and cellobiose , respectively. based on transcription expression profiles, bioinformatics and the characterization of a pts  <dig> knockout strain, we predict that pts  <dig> can transport glucose and mannose  <cit> .

we could not detect increased pts expression from any of the  <dig> complete pts transporters when grown in fructose with the glucose condition as the calibrator. however, pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> are two candidates for fructose transport. both pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> co-localize with orfs  which have a fructose-1-phosphate kinase domain . pts  <dig> is a homolog to the pts transporter in l. acidophilus  which is induced in the presence of fructose  <cit> , yet we were unable to demonstrate induction of pts  <dig> or any other complete pts transporter with fructose. pts  <dig> does not have a homolog in l. acidophilus ncfm. additionally, pts  <dig> and/or pts  <dig> may be involved in tagatose utilization. the potential activity of cog  <dig> includes tagatose-6-phosphate kinase which is required for the tagatose-6-phosphate pathway. unfortunately, no pts transporter amongst lab has been demonstrated to transport tagatose. however, l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to utilize tagatose and also lacks a homolog for pts  <dig>  functional characterization is required to determine if pts  <dig> and/or pts  <dig> transports fructose and/or tagatose.

previous studies have identified a lactose permease in the closely related l. acidophilus ncfm  <cit> . however, l. gasseri atcc  <dig> does not have a homolog for the lactose permease from l. acidophilus ncfm. rather, l. gasseri atcc  <dig> uses pts transporters to import lactose. pts  <dig> and pts  <dig> are induced by lactose  <cit> . analysis of l. gasseri pts  <dig>  l. gasseri pts  <dig> and l. gasseri pts  <dig> pts  <dig> revealed that pts  <dig> is required for maximum fermentation of lactose  <cit> . the only lactose pts transporter previously characterized in lactobacilli has been with l. casei  <cit> . galactose induced several pts transporters   <cit> . similar to lactose, analysis of l. gasseri pts  <dig>  l. gasseri pts  <dig> and l. gasseri pts  <dig> pts  <dig> revealed that pts  <dig> is required for maximum fermentation of galactose  <cit> .

pts  <dig> is a homolog for the pts transporter in l. acidophilus  which is induced in the presence of trehalose and is required for the utilization of trehalose  <cit> . in addition, lgas_ <dig> is homologous to the phosphotrehalase  characterized in l. acidophilus ncfm. while pts  <dig> has an α-glucosidase near , no predicted β-glucosidase is in the pts  <dig> operon, suggesting that pts  <dig> may not involved in β-glucoside uptake as annotated.

no pts transporter that transports n-acetylglucosamine has been characterized in lab. based on our current knowledge, we can not predict which pts transporter can import n-acetylglucosamine.

we have identified several β-glucosides that are likely imported by pts transporters including arbutin, salicin, gentiobiose, amygdalin and cellobiose. pts  <dig> is the major cellobiose pts transporter in l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  cellobiose pts transporters have been identified that also transport other β-glucosides  <cit> . in addition, pts  <dig> is a homolog to a pts transporter in streptococcus mutans that transports β-glucoside esculin  <cit> . pts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all co-localize with potential β-glucosidases. additional characterization is needed to identify which pts transporters are involved in the utilization of β-glucosides.

CONCLUSIONS
pts transporters were confirmed to be largely important in the carbohydrate utilization potential of l. gasseri atcc  <dig>  the pts transporters were identified in various lactobacilli species using bioinformatic analysis. comparative carbohydrate utilization assays were used to analyze the pts content with carbohydrate utilization capability of three l. gasseri strains. the pts carbohydrate specificity of transporters in l. gasseri atcc  <dig> was characterized by studying the transcript expression profiles in response to different carbohydrates. lastly, the growth activity of selected pts knockouts confirmed pts transporter specificity predictions based on bioinformatics and transcript expression profiles. our results confirm the importance of combining bioinformatics, transcript expression profiles and gene inactivation in identifying carbohydrate specificity of pts transporters.
