BACKGROUND
horizontal transfers  are defined as the transmission of genetic information between reproductively isolated species. contrasting with vertical transmission , this process has for a long time been considered as an unusual phenomenon. however, many studies have shown that hts are frequent among prokaryotes and that they widely contribute to lineage evolution by acquisition of new genes  <cit> . several recent reports have shown that gene flow can also occur between reproductively isolated eukaryotic species through hts. these can involve genes  <cit>  as well as transposable elements  <cit> .

transposable elements  are mobile dna sequences which have the capacity to move from one location to another in their host genome. they are divided into two classes according to their mode of transposition . class i, or retrotransposons, transpose through a "copy and paste" mechanism. after their transcription, the rna is reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome, leading to the duplication of the original copy. retrotransposons can in some cases rapidly increase their copy number. in plants, it has been shown that these elements, notably the long terminal repeat -retrotransposons, are the main cause of genome size increase in the genus oryza  <cit> , in cotton  <cit>  or in maize  <cit> , beside polyploidy. class ii elements, or transposons, transpose through a "cut and paste" mechanism. these elements are excised and reintegrated elsewhere in the genome.

because tes from both class i and ii can be found as free molecules  during at least one step of the transposition cycle, they are considered to be more prone to hts than other genomic sequences. in animals, many studies have shown that tes can move between distantly related species, as for the genus drosophila  <cit>  where the p-element invasion constitutes one of the best described cases of ht in eukaryotes  <cit> . in plants, only two studies have described te hts, the first concerning the transfer of a mu-like element  between foxtail millet  and rice   <cit>  and the second involving multiple ht of a retrotransposon between seven species of the genus oryza  <cit> .

the scarcity of cases of te hts in plants may be an indication that they are rare phenomena. alternatively, it could only reflect the technical difficulties raised by their detection and correct characterization. in that case, one could anticipate that the recent accumulation of genomic resources through large scale genome sequencing projects will provide more opportunities to study hts in eukaryotes. as an example, a large amount of genomic sequences is now available for cereals such as rice, sorghum and maize. since rice diverged from maize and sorghum 50– <dig> mya, it excludes the transfer of genetic information by hybridization between these species and makes them appropriate to study hts following a comparative genomic approach. we previously demonstrated the multiple ht of a retrotransposon within the genus oryza  <cit> . by combining genome-wide comparative genomic analyses and molecular approaches, we present phylogenetic evidence of the ht of an ltr-retrotransposon, route <dig>  from a sugarcane relative to several rice species. based on the accumulation of evidence of the occurrence of te-hts in eukaryotes, we also propose to include ltr-rts in a general model of te-mediated plant genome evolution.

RESULTS
route <dig> characterization
in a previous study  <cit> , we identified route <dig>  an ltr-retrotransposon which is found in two copies in the genome of the cultivated rice species, oryza sativa ssp. japonica. one is located on chromosome  <dig>  and the other on chromosome  <dig> . route <dig> is a  <dig>  bp long ltr-retrotransposon with short  <dig> bp ltrs. in addition, only one copy of route <dig> is found in the genome of the indica-type variety 93– <dig>  the copy of route <dig> of oryza sativa ssp. japonica located on chromosome  <dig> is  <dig> % identical to that of indica. dot plot analyses  show that the japonica and indica sub-species share the insertion of route <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which implies that either this insertion predates the radiation of the two subspecies or that it was introgressed from one subspecies into the other.

the structural annotation of route <dig> confirmed that it is a complete element in rice, i.e. that it harbors all the features required for its mobility: ltrs, pbs, ppt and a complete gag-pol open reading frame . in addition, the sequence identity observed between both copies of o. sativa ssp. japonica is  <dig> % . using a substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mutation/site/year  <cit> , we estimated that route <dig> has been active in rice in the last  <dig>  years.

route <dig> as a new candidate for horizontal transfers
in silico detection
in order to investigate the possible origin and the evolution of route <dig> in grasses, we looked for its presence in either the maize or the sorghum genomes. we mined  <dig> additional complete copies of the element from maize and  <dig> from sorghum. for each species, the copies of route <dig> exhibit a high sequence identity, suggesting that they have been active recently in these genomes . surprisingly, the rice route <dig> copies display more than 95% sequence identity with those found in sorghum bicolor, which is unexpected given the date of their radiation, i.e. more than  <dig> mya  <cit> . moreover, this value is higher than that observed between the maize and sorghum copies of route <dig> , although these two species diverged only  <dig> mya  <cit> . we also compared these values with those for seven orthologous genes in rice, maize and sorghum . on average, these genes are 85% identical, which indicates that the route <dig> ltr-retrotransposon is far more conserved between rice and sorghum than these seven genes. we also studied the phylogenetic relationships between all the route <dig> elements found in rice, sorghum and maize genomes. the phenetic tree  clearly shows that the rice copies form a cluster with that of sorghum. however, this result is incongruent with the species phylogenetic relationships established with known genes  <cit> .

wet lab validation
in order to confirm the phylogenetic incongruence revealed by the route <dig> sequences of rice, sorghum and maize, we pcr amplified, cloned and sequenced  <dig> kb fragments of route <dig> from various species of oryza, sorghum and zea. we completed this analysis with the tentative cloning of route <dig> homologs in bamboo, saccharum, millets, wheat and brachypodium. we then obtained additional sequences for three wild rice, three saccharum, two bamboos, two teosintes and five wild sorghum species. for each of the accessions of wild rice, saccharum and sorghum bicolor used in the study, we pcr amplified and cloned the adh <dig> gene and compared the sequences obtained with that deposited in genbank for the corresponding species. we therefore ruled out the possibility that our results were due to dna contamination or mislabelling.

the phenetic tree obtained from the cloned sequences is given in figure 3c. this tree displays some phylogenetic incongruences, as in the case of that based on the in silico data above. both oryza and phyllostachis genus  sequences are embedded among panicoideae whereas, according to the phylogeny of grasses, they should appear as outgroups . all homologs cloned from oryza species  form a clear cluster near the sugarcane accessions. interestingly, o. sativa sequences show a  <dig> % divergence with that of the wild sugarcane, saccharum officinarum . by using a substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mutation/site/year  <cit> , we estimate that this corresponds to a  <dig>  my old radiation whereas both species diverged more than  <dig> mya. surprisingly, phyllostachis sequences are only 9% divergent from the copies of maize and sorghum orthologs which correspond to a  <dig>  my radiation whereas bamboo and panicoideae diverged  <dig> mya.

the subsequent cloning of route <dig> in these additional species provided a better understanding of the origin of the ht. if the transfer was recent, it is expected that the copies of both the donor and the receiver species should exhibit a high sequence identity. as a consequence, they should appear in the same cluster in the phylogenetic tree. route <dig> is  <dig> % identical between rice and saccharum officinarum, however the sequences of the genus oryza are clustered near to, although not within, those of saccharum. further studies should be made to identify the species at the origin of the transfer. nevertheless, we expect that this species should be phylogenetically close  to the saccharum genus. a similar observation is made for the transfer involving phyllostachis species. a larger sample of poaceae taxa should be tested to infer more precisely the origin of these transfers.

comparison of the evolutionary dynamics of route <dig> with that of selected genes in rice, sorghum and maize
for the seven genes mentioned above, we performed an interspecific non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratio  analysis by comparing maize, sorghum and rice orthologs. table  <dig> shows that all the genes studied are submitted to purifying selection. all ka/ks ratio are lower than  <dig>   and they all display similar interspecific sequence identities. we performed a similar analysis on route <dig> and we observed that this element is under selective constraints when interspecific comparisons are performed .

discussion
evidence for horizontal transfer of route66
transposable elements are known to evolve faster than genes and are rapidly eliminated through unequal and illegitimate recombination  <cit> . since rice and sorghum diverged some 50– <dig> mya  <cit> , homologous retrotransposons are not expected to be found among these species or, at least, they should exhibit a very low sequence identity. on one hand, route <dig> displays a high sequence identity  between rice and sorghum throughout the element despite their radiation date . on the other hand, route <dig> is more conserved between these species than between sorghum and maize . this constitutes our first argument in favour of ht. furthermore, route <dig> is also more conserved between rice and sorghum than genes which are under selective pressure  and this constitutes the second and even stronger argument in favour of the ht.

however, two other mechanisms, i.e. strong selective pressure throughout the sequence of this element and the reduction of mutation rate in the region flanking the insertions could alternatively lead to the conservation of route <dig> between rice, sorghum and sugarcane.

te domestication, defined as the co-option of te-encoding proteins into functional host protein is one of the process which could be responsible for selective pressure on a te sequence  <cit> . a number of studies have demonstrated that domestication is common in some animal genomes  <cit>  and most of them involved a transposase-encoding sequence  <cit> . through ka/ks analyses, we showed that route <dig> has been subjected to purifying selection, which could be in accordance with a putative functional role of this element. however, this could also reflect the fact that non-functional tes can not transpose and are rapidly eliminated from the genome through deletions, therefore inducing a bias in the ka/ks ratio. however, in the case of domestication, although the element evolves slowly, the topology of the phenetic tree obtained with route <dig> should be similar to that obtained with the genes classically used for this purpose such as the waxy or phytochrome genes. this is clearly not the case as shown in figures 3a, b and 3c since all sequences from the oryza genus  are clustered with those of the panicoideae . they clearly cluster near the sugarcane sequences whereas, according to the phylogenetic relationship of these species, the oryza genus is obviously out of the panicoideae sub-family. this phylogenetic incongruence is thus in agreement with the sequence identities that were calculated. the high nucleotide sequence identity between rice and sorghum concerns the whole element. no case of domestication of a complete element  has ever been demonstrated so far. for these reasons, we rule out the possibility of the domestication of the tes.

an alternative explanation is that the elements could be inserted into a region with a reduced mutation rate. our ka/ks survey for the genes flanking both insertions in o. sativa ssp. japonica showed that they are submitted to selective pressure but exhibit sequence identity similar to that of randomly chosen genes such as waxy, nod <dig> and gid <dig> . we therefore conclude that both insertion regions of route <dig> in rice are not under a stronger selection than other parts of the genome.

considering all these results and taking into account current knowledge on transposable element evolution, we propose that route <dig> has been horizontally transferred into the rice genome. moreover, we used sugarcane to estimate the age of the transfer. sugarcane and rice copies harbour  <dig> % identity  therefore we estimate that the ht occurred recently, during the last million years. however, both sub-species, indica and japonica, share a common insertion on chromosome  <dig> . knowing that divergence between indica and japonica occurred during the last million years  <cit> , these results tend to demonstrate that the transfer of route <dig> occurred just before or concomitantly with the subspecies radiation. moreover, the genome of o. sativa ssp japonica harbours one more copy than that of o. sativa ssp. indica. this indicates that route <dig> has been active since the sub-speciation.

evidence of multiple horizontal transfers
the sequences obtained for the wild rice species, o. rufipogon, o. longistaminata and o. ridleyi, are clustered with that of o. sativa. the wild rice copies are more than  <dig> % identical to that of o. sativa, which is incongruent with the species radiation since, for example, o. sativa and o. ridleyi diverged  <dig> mya. this data is therefore in agreement with the occurrence of a horizontal inheritance of route <dig> in the genus oryza. however, further studies should be made to test if the ht occured independently from the donor species to the four oryza species or if the copy was first transferred to one rice species and then spread through the genus oryza. nevertheless, it was previously demonstrated that the ltr-retrotransposon rire <dig> has been horizontally transferred between seven wild rice species  <cit> . we therefore consider that route <dig> could constitute a second example of multiple hts in the genus oryza.

we suspect that another ht of route <dig> occured between a panicoideae and phyllostachis species. phyllostachis sequences display more than 92% sequence identity with some sequence of maize and sorghum. moreover, phyllostachis sequences are included in the cluster formed by the route <dig> homologs from the panicoideae species, although these sequences should be clearly separated according to the species radiation . the hypothesis of ht in phyllostachis is reinforced by the fact that route <dig> was not found in the triticeae. even if we can not exclude that this absence is due to to a pcr bias, one explanation is that route <dig> has not been vertically inherited in grasses although we can not rule out that the element was lost in the ancestor of the poideae sub-family. this could be tested by the analysis of a larger sample of pooideae species. the high conservation of route <dig> between phyllostachis and maize as well as the phylogenetic incongruences are unexpected and could be the result of a second ht of route <dig> involving bambusoideae. however, this needs to be ascertained by supplementary analyses.

mechanisms involved in horizontal transfers
based on what is known in both animals and plants, three main mechanisms have been invoked to explain hts  <cit> . the first is a direct plant-to-plant transfer. this has been well described in the case of gene transfer between parasitic angiosperms and their hosts  <cit> . direct plant-to-plant transfer was estimated to be responsible for  <dig> hts of plant mitochondrial genes to amborella  <cit> . even if no case of direct plant-to-plant hts has been reported yet for tes, this process is likely to occur for any dna sequence . in our case, no rice parasitic plants are known but we cannot exclude the possibility that such plants existed in the past and could have been at the origin of hts.

an alternative hypothesis is transfer by hybridization and introgression. this hypothesis remains attractive since interspecific hybridization is a common process in plants, presumed to be at the origin of most allopolyploidization events. many examples of introgressions have been described and are considered to be responsible for organellar gene transfers in plants  <cit> . however, this mechanism is only possible if the species are close enough to hybridize spontaneously, which is not the case for the ehrhartoideae  and panicoideae.

vector mediated transfers constitutes a third possible mechanism. this could explain hts between distant species and many studies suggest that bacteria  <cit>  or fungi  <cit>  could be responsible for hts. only one example clearly demonstrated the transfer from a reptile to a virus, which constitutes a first step to a vector-mediated transfer  <cit> . one could suppose that the integration of a retroelement into a viral genome  could occur in the same way in plants. this could explain why, if several organisms share common parasites, some retrotransposons could be involved in multiple hts. this still needs to be tested by further experiments to fully understand the mechanisms involved in hts.

transpositional activity of route <dig> and potential impact on genome evolution
the two route <dig> copies of o. sativa ssp. japonica are  <dig> % identical. this indicates that route <dig> has been active recently, i.e. during the last  <dig>  years. in plants, few ltr retrotransposons are known to be still active. these are for example tos <dig> in rice  <cit> , tnt <dig> in tobacco  <cit>  or bare <dig> in barley  <cit> , whereas most tes are silenced either by the methylation and/or the small rna pathways  <cit> . as an example, the cac <dig> element is transpositionaly activated when present in a ddm <dig> hypomethylation background in arabidopsis  <cit> . hirochika et al. have also demonstrated that tto <dig>  a tobacco te, can transpose in a heterologous systems such as rice or arabidopsis thaliana even if the copy number is positively correlated with dna methylation, leading to rapid silencing of the element  <cit> . one could therefore propose that by invading a new genome a transferred element could escape epigenetic silencing and be active after its transfer. this could explain why  <dig>  and  <dig> copies of the horizontally transferred copy of rire <dig> are now present in the o. minuta and o. granulata genomes respectively  <cit> . the activation process could favor the retention of the transferred copy in the new genome by decreasing the probability of its elimination by genetic drift  <cit>  and could explain why several cases of te-hts have been described. in our case, route <dig> has not undergone any burst of transposition because it is only present in two copies in the rice genome. however the transpositional activity of the transferred copies of route <dig> possibly explains how it could have spread in several taxa of the grass family. more generally, the transpositional activity of transposable elements after their hts could explain their evolutive success in eukaryotes lineages since it allows retrotransposons to persist after invasion of a new genome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
there is no doubt that te hts could play a role in genome and thus in species evolution by generating variability  <cit> , since tes are known to have an impact on genes  <cit>  and on genome dynamics  <cit> . in addition, there is some evidence that horizontally transferred tes could lead to structural and functional modifications in the recipient species. as an example, the p-element is responsible for genetic abnormalities such as high mutation rate, chromosome breakage or sterility in drosophila melanogaster when crossing females lacking p-element and males harbouring more than  <dig> copies of this element  <cit> . moreover, hts often involve active elements  which could make them responsible for modification in both genome structure and gene expression. we therefore believe that ht of tes could have an important impact on genome evolution.

tes are highly dynamic sequences known to mutate rapidly. it is also commonly admitted that they can massively increase genome size through bursts of transpositional activity, as in the case of the wild rice species o. australiensis where three ltr-retrotransposons comprise 60% of the genome  <cit> . it is also well established that transposable elements are rapidly deleted from the genome  <cit> . these observations led some authors to propose the increase/decrease model for plant genome evolution  <cit>  which postulates that bursts of transposition are rapidly counterbalanced by deletion. based on the high rate of hts involving mariner-like elements , it was further proposed that mles could maintain themselves by horizontal transmission and thus counterbalance their elimination by stochastic loss and mutation  <cit> . given the accumulation of the recent demonstrations of te hts, we propose to generalize this model of evolution to all classes of transposable elements. horizontally transferred tes can escape silencing and therefore transpose before they are deleted, increasing their chances of survival in their new host genome. hts therefore allow tes to colonize and invade new genomes by bursts of transposition as has been shown for rire <dig> in wild rice  <cit>  or for the p-element in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . we propose that hts may be a frequent process in the life cycle and evolution of tes and that this phenomenon explains their persistence in the genomes of almost all eukaryotic genomes.
