BACKGROUND
peanut  is an important economical crop for oil production and nutritious food for human consumption. however, aflatoxin contamination caused by aspergillus fungi is a great concern in peanut production worldwide. aflatoxins are the most toxic and carcinogenic compounds associated with both acute and chronic toxicity in animals and humans  <cit> . both drought stress and high geocarposphere temperature during the latter part of the growing season compromise peanut defense to fungal invasion and exacerbate aflatoxin formation in the seeds  <cit> . drought stress, extreme temperature or fungal infection can also impair plant growth and yield performance. the development of adapted peanut germplasm and cultivars with improved host-plant resistance is one of our main research objectives.

resistance to several pathogens is known in peanut  <cit>  indicating that peanuts have evolved a series of defense mechanisms against invasion by plant pathogens. a better understanding of the molecular mechanism for resistance to aspergillus collonization will aid in designing strategies to develop new resistant peanut cultivars. the availability of genomic tools and bio-informatics softwares will significantly improve our ability to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of host-plant resistance and to facilitate the genetic improvement of cultivated peanut. genomic research can also be used to discover novel genes with potential resistance and to develop molecular markers for use in marker-assisted selection. recently, some genes and proteins associated with a. parasiticus or/and drought stress were identified and studied utilizing genomic and proteomic tools  <cit> . with the completion of the rice and arabidopsis whole genome sequencing projects, a vast amount of valuable data has been generated to facilitate cross-species genome comparison in the plant kingdom. the peanut genome size is significantly larger  than the currently sequenced plants  <cit> , such as arabidopsis , rice , and medicago   <cit> . financial requirement makes it unrealistic to completely sequence the whole peanut genome in the near future. therefore, peanut expressed sequenced tags  would be the cost-effective strategy to identify important peanut genes involved in defense to fungal invasion and to study gene expression pattern as well as genetic regulation  <cit> .

expressed sequence tags  is an effective genomic approach for rapid identification of expressed genes, and has been widely used in genome-wide gene expression studies in various tissues, developmental stages or under different environmental conditions  <cit> . in addition, the availability of cdna sequences has accelerated further molecular characterization of genes of interest and provided sequence information for microarray construction and genome annotation  <cit> . as of march  <dig>   <dig>  large number of ests of the top five plant species including arapidopsis , rice , maize , wheat  and barley  have been deposited to the genbank database   <cit> . these sequences provide opportunities to accelerate the understanding of the genetic mechanisms that control plant growth and responses to the environment. in contrast, there were only  <dig>  arachis ests deposited in genbank, among which  <dig>  were derived from cultivated peanut a. hypogaea and the remaining  <dig>  from the wild species of a. stenosperma. these ests submitted by different peanut researchers were from different tissues and subjected to different abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

in this report, an effort for large-scale sequencing of cdna was carried out with two goals: gene expression comparison between these two genotypes, 'tifrunner' and 'gt-c20', and providing genomic resource for discovery and understanding of novel defense-related genes involved in resistance to aspergillus colonization and drought stress. to increase gene diversity in the est population and the probability of identifying genes associated with drought tolerance and disease resistance, different cdna libraries were prepared from developing seeds at late reproductive stages of a resistant and a susceptible peanut genotypes challenged by a. parasiticus and drought stress. six libraries were constructed that resulted in a total of  <dig>  high-quality est sequences, from which  <dig>  unique sequences were identified. to provide useful information on the expression profiling of resistant genes at various seed developmental stages and to offer valuable genomic resource for peanut functional genomics, an extensive analysis of these ests was performed using a variety of computational approaches. a functional catalog of expressed genes is reported here as well as a preliminary view of their expression profiles in developing seeds at different developmental stages. this functional catalog seeks to link genes and pathways, and to provide a list of features that could aid in the understanding of how resistance genes are involved in response to biotic and abiotic challenges and how their expression is regulated.

RESULTS
generation of ests from developing seeds challenged by a. parasiticus and drought stress
six cdna libraries were constructed from developing seeds of two varieties  collected at three reproductive stages  after challenging by a. parasiticus and drought stress. from the six cdna libraries, a total of  <dig>  clones were randomly selected, sequenced and analyzed using sequencher software. the vector sequences of the raw sequence reads were trimmed off and low-quality sequences  were removed. a total of  <dig>  high-quality est sequences  were generated from the  <dig>  clones. total  <dig>  ests were generated from 'gt-c20' and  <dig>  ests were generated from 'tifrunner' . the percentage of acceptable quality est sequences from individual libraries varied from 81% to 88%. the average length of the ests is  <dig> bp ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . the sum of the total ests equal to  <dig>  mb of peanut genome. these quality ests combined from both genotypes at three stages were further assembled into  <dig>  unique ests. among them,  <dig>  were singletons and  <dig>  were tcs. the  <dig>  ests have been deposited to the ncbi genbank database with accession numbers es <dig> to es <dig> 

overlapping of unique est sequences and high redundancy of genes
a comparison of unique est sequences from the two genotypes and different stages of developing seeds allows the identification of common and unique sets of expressed genes among the six libraries. the unique ests from the six libraries were summarized in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> unique sequences were present in the c20r <dig>  c20r <dig>  c20r <dig>  tfr <dig>  tfr <dig> and tfr <dig>  respectively. the distribution and overlapping of these unique est sequences is shown in figure  <dig> 

among the unique ests from the c20r <dig>  c20r <dig> and c20r <dig> libraries, only  <dig> ests  were shown common to all three libraries . the number of ests that were common between any two libraries varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. when the same analysis was applied to the ests from the tfr <dig>  tfr <dig> and tfr <dig>  similar results were obtained . the ests that were common to all three 'tifrunner' libraries were about  <dig> %, similar to that of 'gt-c20'. there were  <dig>  ests that were common to tfr <dig> and tfr <dig> libraries,  <dig>  ests were found common to both tfr <dig> and tfr <dig> libraries,  <dig>  ests were found common to both tfr <dig> and tfr <dig> libraries. in order to investigate differential gene expression between the resistant and susceptible genotypes, we also performed a comparative analysis between 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' libraries at each seed developmental stage. there were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were found common to 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' at r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  respectively . these results indicated that the differences in transcript abundance might reflect genuine differences in the gene expression in the different libraries. these variations may be due to the differences in disease resistance, tolerance to abiotic stress or other genetic factors at the different developmental stages.

genes that are shared between or among the libraries included highly expressed transcripts. to further investigate the high frequency of transcripts, all six libraries were analyzed, clustered and assembled individually by genotype. those highly expressed genes  assembled from more than  <dig> individual ests were listed in table  <dig> for the 'gt-c20' libraries , and table  <dig> for the 'tifrunner' libraries . a total of  <dig>  ests from 'gt-c20' and  <dig>  ests from 'tifrunner' non-normalized libraries were assembled into  <dig> and  <dig>  tcs, respectively. there were  <dig> gt-c20' and  <dig> 'tifrunner' highly expressed transcripts assembled from more than  <dig> individual consensus ests were selected for distribution analysis . these tcs were concurrently queried against genbank non-redundant protein database  in searching their putative functions. the blast results showed that all the highly expressed genes  were homologous to known fragments in the genbank database . there were  <dig> highly expressed genes, identified by blast search, to have the same putative function in both 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' libraries. these highly expressed genes encode constitutive proteins such as allergen protein  , storage proteins , structural protein , and stress-resistance associated proteins .

functional classification of unique est sequences
in order to further characterize the putative functions of unique ests and involvement in different biological processes, a similarity search against the mips arabidopsis thaliana database was performed. according to the mips functional catalogue criteria, 'gt-c20' unique sequences whose functions could be predicted from the similarity to arabidopsis proteins with an e value of ≤ 1e- <dig> were classified into twenty-two categories   <cit> . the same analytic procedure was applied to 'tifrunner' unique ests . the 'tifrunner' ests with significant protein homology were also sorted into  <dig> groups. these results suggested that the genes represented by these unique est sequences may play roles in different biological process.

the results of functional classification showed that the unknown genes, including those which had no hits or low identity  with the arabidopsis protein database and those which matched the unclassified and unknown proteins, represented the largest set of genes . the second largest proportion of genes was found to participate in the biological process of metabolism. the resistance-related and environment-interacted genes were  <dig> % and  <dig> % in 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner', respectively . these results indicated that it may be possible to discover novel genes involved in biotic and abiotic responses using the est profiling startegy.

expression profiles of cdna from different genotypes at different developmental stages
without normalization or subtraction in library construction, the number of the cdna clones  for a given gene reflected the abundance of the gene expression at the corresponding developmental stage. the number of the consensus ests that assembled into a unique gene at the three developmental stages may represent the temporal expression pattern of this gene. therefore, the temporal expression profile of a gene can be deduced by the comparison of the est frequency at different developmental stage, while the temporal expression profile of a gene of different genotypes may be measured by comparison of the est frequency of the different genotypes. given the fact that the absolute est counts varies in different libraries , a meaningful measure of expression profile similarity is independent of these absolute numbers. to test the independence of est distribution within the libraries, an estimation of the relative abundance defined as r  was employed to identify the most highly significant differences in est abundance for each tc among the libraries. the unequal distribution of specific ests with statistically significance within each library implied that these ests expressed at a higher level in some libraries than others. in order to limit the analysis to those genes which differentially expressed at different developmental stages, only tcs with r value larger than  <dig> were used for hierarchical clustering analysis. this r value provided an  <dig> % true positive rate  <cit> . according to the cutoff threshold of r >  <dig>   <dig> tcs from 'gt-c20' libraries and  <dig> from 'tifrunner' libraries were selected to search against genbank non-redundant protein database  .

based on the abundance and the r statistic, a clustering analysis was performed to assess the relatedness of each library in terms of gene expression profiles. as ewing et al.  described  <cit> , we compiled the  <dig> tcs into a matrix file comprised of the frequency of ests corresponding to each contig in the library that represented different seed developmental stages and performed hierarchical clustering analysis. from hierarchical clustering analysis, the  <dig> tcs with different redundant and similar expression patterns could be grouped into eight major clusters from a to h as shown in figure  <dig>  each cluster represents a different expression profile. hierarchical clustering analysis showed that most of high abundant genes with same putative functions from 'gt-c20' libraries and 'tifrunner' libraries could be grouped into the same cluster. these genes usually encode constitutive proteins  and their expression patterns are not genotype dependent. some putative genes related to resistance such as pr <dig> protein and defensin  <dig>  precursors were found only in 'gt-c20' and the expression pattern was up-regulated .

the results of hierarchical clustering and similarity search indicated that the  <dig> unique ests  with similar dna sequence were not equally distributed between the 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' libraries. in comparison, only  <dig> unique ests  were not equally distributed within different 'gt-c20' libraries . there were seven, ten and eight unique tcs were observed in the c20r <dig>  c20r <dig> and c20r <dig> libraries, respectively. three unique tcs  were observed between c20r <dig> and c20r <dig> libraries. these three unique est contigs  were primarily found in the c20r <dig> and c20r <dig> libraries. only one unique est  had cdna clones represented only in c20r <dig> and c20r <dig> libraries. four unique ests  had cdna clones equally distributed across the three libraries of 'gt-c20'.

in the three 'tifrunner' libraries, there were  <dig> unique ests  whose cdna clones were not equally distributed . comparison within all 'tifrunner' libraries, fourteen, five and seven unique est sequences were observed in tfr <dig>  tfr <dig> and tfr <dig> libraries, respectively. six unique ests were observed only in tfr <dig> and tfr <dig> but absent in tfr <dig> libraries. two unique ests were predominately present in the tfr <dig> and tfr <dig>  the remaining unique ests with r >  <dig> had cdna clones equally distributed across the three 'tifrunner' libraries.

defense-related genes identified by database search 

the information provided by ests from plant tissues challenged by specific biotic and abiotic stress conditions offered an opportunity for gene discovery. the unique est sequences from 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' were compared individually to the non-redundant protein sequence database available from ncbi by blastx program with a minimum e cutoff value < 1e- <dig>  in reference to the results of differential expression and hierarchical clustering analysis , only those genes whose expression were significant up or down regulated at different stages were selected. the other defense-related genes whose e value > 1e- <dig> treated as false positive and were excluded from the analysis.

among the unique est sequences with r >  <dig>  only three up-regulated putative defense-related genes  were identified in both 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' libraries . six up-regulated unique est sequences were observed only in 'gt-c20' libraries, and matched previous reported known protein including pr <dig> protein, defensin protein and calmodulin . in the 'tifrunner' libraries, five defense-related genes such as metallothionein-like protein, heat shock protein and cu/zn superoxide dismutase ii were detected with significant up-regulation.

+: the putative resistance-related gene was identified in the libraries.

-: no putative resistance-related gene was identified in the libraries.

comparison of these est data to other plant est sequences
in order to compare these peanut ests to other publicly available plant ests, a similarity search against several plant est databases in tigr gene indices was performed . when dna sequence identity was at ≥ 90%, the percentages of peanut ests matching soybean and medicago truncatula were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. when dna sequence identity was decreased to ≥ 80%, the percentages of peanut ests matched to soybean and m. truncatula greatly increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in contrast, the percentages of peanut ests that matched to arabidopsis, rape seed, rice, maize and wheat ests were less than 50%, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, when dna sequence identity was set at ≥ 80%. although peanut and rape seed are both oilseed crops, when the dna sequence identity was set at ≥ 80%, the similarity of peanut ests matching rape seed ests was only  <dig> %, far less than that of the legume crops soybean and m. truncatula. as expected, peanut ests showed a higher similarity to ests of the legume species than to those of cereal crops, and also present a higher homology to ests of the dicot plants than to those of the monocots.

athe criteria for stand-alone blastn were:  extract-match bp ≥ 11;  e value ≤ 1e-5; and  identity ≥ 80% and 90% at dna sequence level.

discussion
larger-scale sequencing of expressed sequence tags  is an effective method for gene discovery. the available peanut est database in genbank is  <dig>  entries as of march  <dig>   <dig>  which were derived from leaf, root, pod, cotyledon and other tissues of cultivated peanut  and wild species , respectively. compared to maize, wheat, rice and soybean, the number and scale of peanut ests deposited in genbank are far behind those major crops and it is inadequate to meet the need of peanut genetic and genomic research. many successful est projects have been reported for a number of species and from a variety of tissues under various conditions  <cit> . however, most of these est projects were restricted to different tissues from one genotype or different tissues from different genotypes. the est project reported in this study is uniquely and systematically designed using the same tissues  from two genotypes, 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' with different characters in terms of resistance and susceptibility to diseases, under the same environmental conditions  at specific seed developmental stages . the completion of this peanut est project makes the available peanut ests in the genbank database doubled for the research community to share. in addition, the six libraries were neither normalized nor subtracted so that the frequency of a unique est  within each stage could be determined and could provide a hint for the expression level of that specific gene.

to understand the molecular basis of host resistance to a. flavus/parasiticus and consequent aflatoxin contamination, we monitored the transcript changes at these three developmental stages in developing seeds. the  <dig>  unique ests were categorized into different functional groups based on the mips criteria  <cit> . the highly expressed overlapping ests also helped in assembling full-length unique transcripts expressed in peanut seed, such as the putative allergen protein . the putative functions of those identified unique ests have been predicted by similarity search according to mips . comparing to the arabidopsis sequence data,  <dig> % of total peanut unique ests matched arabidopsis protein sequences with a known function and  <dig> % had significant similarity to arabidopsis protein sequences with unknown function. about  <dig> % of the total unique ests showed no significant similarity to arabidopsis al all. those peanut ests matched arabidopsis know functions were divided into nineteen categories  <cit> . a major portion of these genes with known functions fall in the category of metabolism  followed by transcription . to further identify novel peanut sequences, a comprehensive similarity search against genbank non-redudant  database using the stand-alone blastx algorithm was performed and resulted in the identification of an additional  <dig> putative novel sequences including  <dig> unique peanut ests matching reported known peanut genes. the blast result revealed that significant number of unique peanut seed ests match soybean , arabidopsis , rice , and other plant species.

in this study, some previously reported defense-related genes have been confirmed to be expressed. desiccation-related proteins could be induced by drought stress and were relatively sensitive to cellular dehydration  <cit> . the lea  proteins are known to be involved in protecting higher plants from damage caused by environmental stresses, especially dehydration from drought  <cit> . serine protease inhibitors are involved in plant defense against pathogens and could be induced in response to infection by pathogens  <cit> . these three different classes of genes were up-regulated in the three reproduction stages of both 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' libraries. other related-genes with significant differential expression were present either in 'gt-c20' or in 'tifrunner'. for example, the pr <dig> protein family is induced by plants in response to pathogen infection as well as abiotic stress, and showed transcriptional up-regulation upon biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . calmodulin  is a ubiquitous ca2+ sensor found in all eukaryotes and has been shown to participate in the regulation of diverse calcium-dependent physiological processes  <cit> . calmodulin plays an important role in sensing and transducing changes in cellular ca2+ concentration in response to several biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . cam has been implicated in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . pr <dig> and calmodulin were significantly up-regulated in 'gt-c20' libraries but not in 'tifrunner' . in contrast, two heat shock proteins, synthesized in response to heat stress  <cit> , were detected up-regulated in 'tifrunner' libraries but not in 'gt-c20' . this raises questions of why certain genes are present or absent or show differential expression in different genotypes, such as 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner'. there are two possible hypothetic explanations. one is that in this study we randomly selected clones for cdna sequencing and might have missed some clones that could be in 'gt-c20' or 'tifrunner' libraries. the other is that the presence, absence or significantly differential expressions of certain genes, especially defense-related genes, are a result of the genetic differences  of these two genotypes. in order to verify the assumption that variability of expression might be a result of genetic differences in disease resistance or stresses tolerance, two genes  were selected for sequence similarity analysis. as expected, the similarity of iso ara h <dig> between 'gt-c20' and 'tifrunner' was 97%, however, lea  <dig> sequences shared only 91% identity over  <dig> bases. for iso ara h <dig>  among  <dig>  consensus sequences,  <dig> gaps were found. for lea  <dig>  among  <dig> consensus sequences,  <dig> gaps were found . the results implied that the allelic differences of defense-related genes were higher than that of constitutively expressed genes. further investigations are necessary to characterize their gene functions and to analyze the patterns of their gene expressions.

CONCLUSIONS
this is a unique study using both resistance and susceptibilities genotypes under the same environmental conditions as challenged by a. parasiticus and drought stress at specific seed developmental stages . the large number of peanut ests obtained provides an important resource for gene discovery, for gene expression profiling, and for microarray design  <cit> . the frequency of the individual est demonstrated the temporal expression patterns of a given gene. the information from this study will significantly improve our understanding the mechanism of host resistance and provide a useful genomic resource for peanut breeding and aflatoxin research community.
