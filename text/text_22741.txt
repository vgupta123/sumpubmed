BACKGROUND
with the development of sequencing techniques, more and more genomes are available now, making the genome-scale sequence studies possible, such as the gene structure prediction, gene organization identification and so on. in genome sequence, there is one kind of gene pairs which are arranged head-to-head on opposite strands and with no more than  <dig> base pairs separating their transcription start sites   <cit> . such an arrangement is previously defined as "bidirectional" and the divergent gene pairs are termed as "bidirectional genes", while the intergenic region between a "bidirectional gene pair" is often called a "bidirectional promoter" . individual examples of bidirectional genes as well as a few genome-wide analyses have been known in mammalian and human genomes for years  <cit> . the "head-to-head" gene organization was first observed in the mouse dhfr gene  <cit> . another example was found by gavalas et al in the analysis of the chicken gpat/airc bidirectional promoter  <cit> . adachi et al discovered that bidirectional gene organization is a common architectural feature of the human genome and trinklein et al have made a systematic analysis of bidirectional genes in human genome, finding that they are more correlated in expression and often function in dna repair  <cit> . li et al analyzed the bidirectional genes using human, chicken and fugu genomic data and concluded that this gene organization is ancient and conserved, which subjects functionally related genes to correlated transcriptional regulation and thus provides an exquisite mechanism of transcriptional regulation based on gene organization  <cit> . to our knowledge, no genome-wide analysis of bidirectional genes for plant genome has been reported until now.

in our study, we pay more attention to the regulatory analysis of the intergenic region between bidirectional genes. in the papers mentioned above, a "bidirectional promoter" is presumedly defined as the intergenic dna sequence between two tsss of a bidirectional gene pair. however, increasing evidences show that in eukaryotic organisms, promoters are not always in the vicinity of tsss of genes, but can locate from the distant 5' upstream regions of genes, or to the 3' downstream regions  <cit> . recently the encode pilot project even suggested that the human genome is pervasively transcribed  <cit>  and it is noted that most genes are controlled cooperatively by several transcription factors  binding to various regulatory elements  <cit>  which are often located spatially close to each other. therefore, in the scrutiny of intergenic dna sequences between bidirectional genes, an additional criterion was used here to see whether those sequences are also enriched of regulatory elements which are essential for the initiation of transcription. the hierarchical stochastic language  model we recently developed  <cit>  were utilized to identify putative transcriptional regulatory regions  on those intergenic sequences between bidirectional genes by scoring them. the trr regions identified by hsl are enriched of cooperative motif pairs which are over-represented in promoters. we found that these cooperative motif pairs selected from yeast are conserved across species and hsl trained on yeast are successfully applied to identify promoters  for fly, human, arabidopsis thaliana, and rice  <cit> .

in this article, we conducted a genome-wide survey of arabidopsis thaliana genome and identified  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs in the whole genome . besides examining the expression and function association of bidirectional genes as previous studies  <cit> , we searched the intergenic dna sequences between bidirectional genes by hsl to see if they contain trr. we found that these  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs show a higher probability to be coordinately regulated and functionally associated which are consistent with results in mammalian  <cit> ; and thus indicate that this "head-to-head" gene organization is prevalent in a. thaliana genome. we further showed that functionally associated bidirectional genes have higher frequencies to contain intergenic sequences with higher trr scores, indicating that these sequences response for co-regulating the bidirectional genes. interestingly, most of the intergenic dna sequences of bidirectional genes with high trr scores contain only one peak of trr score, suggesting that the gene pair share the same promoter. finally, we picked  <dig> functionally associated bidirectional gene pairs with high trr scores and hypothesized them to be regulated by bidirectional promoters. five of them share common ancient orthologs and in addition, more than half of them are further supported by sharing the same functional categories  as these of handful experimental verified bidirectional genes in other organisms.

RESULTS
identify bidirectional genes
we calculated distances between the tsss of neighboring gene pairs among the whole arabidopsis thaliana genome, excluding chloroplast genome and mitochondrial genome .  <dig> pairs have a separating region not more than  <dig> bp, while only  <dig> pairs are arranged "head-to-head" on opposite strands, accounting for approximately  <dig> % of all the  <dig> a. thaliana genes . of the  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs, the max distance between tsss is  <dig> base pairs while the minimum is - <dig> base pairs . there are  <dig> pairs with distances less than  <dig>  meaning  <dig> % pairs have genes whose transcripts are predicted to overlap at the 5' ends, whereas  <dig> pairs  are nonoverlaping. interestingly, the majority  of the  <dig> nonoverlaping bidirectional promoters are more than  <dig> base pairs in length. for comparison, we randomly chose  <dig> gene pairs to give a contrast of bidirectional genes, which will be served as background references through the following analysis.

coexpression of bidirectional genes
for a potential of sharing common cis-regulatory elements, the two genes from one bidirectional pair tend to be coordinately regulated than randomly paired genes in expression level  <cit> . we calculated the pearson correlation coefficients of expression for bidirectional gene pairs as well as the randomly picked gene pairs over  <dig> data sets independently, where microarray data are derived from atgenexpression project . for  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs having complete gene expression data available, their averaged correlation coefficients  are significantly correlated than that of random pairs . previous studies showed that genes in a neighborhood region are often coexpressed  <cit> , so we also computed the pearson correlation coefficients of neighboring genes in arabidopsis thaliana genome . figure  <dig> – distribution of pearson correlation coefficients. shows that bidirectional genes are more correlated in expression than random gene pairs  and neighboring genes  by the wilcoxon rank sum test. setting the 95th percentiles of the random pairs' correlation distribution as a cutoff of coordinately regulation, we find  <dig> pairs  of the  <dig> pairs with correlation coefficients are more correlated in expression. this result is similar to some earlier works  <cit> . we also find that there is no significant relationship between the length of a bidirectional promoter and the degree of expression correlation . this result is consistent with trinklein's work  <cit> .

functional similarity of bidirectional genes
in the previous studies about human genome, researchers noted that many bidirectional transcribed genes are related to dna-repair mechanism  <cit> . it means that head-to-head structured genes may be associated functionally. to test this hypothesis, we analyzed the functional similarity of bidirectional genes using the gene ontology  functional annotation . go is a rooted directed acyclic graph  with three subcategories of "cellular component", "molecular function" and "biological process". each go node covers a set of genes with specific annotations and a gene is covered by one or multiple go nodes along the dag generally. the closer a node is to the terminal, the more detailed annotations are given. similarly to deng et al  <cit> , those nodes that cover at least  <dig> genes and none of their offspring node satisfying this condition are defined as terminal informative nodes . we obtained  <dig> tins in subcategory "cellular component",  <dig> tins in "molecular function" and  <dig> tins in "biological process" respectively, which can be found in the additional file  <dig>  among all the  <dig> genes of arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> are covered by at least one tin, namely  <dig> genes with "cellular component" tins,  <dig> with "molecular function" tins and  <dig> with "biological process" tins, respectively. we declared a pair is annotated by meaning that both genes of the pair are covered by at least one tin in a specific subcategory and assigned functional similarity as  <dig> if the two genes have overlapping tins and  <dig> otherwise. among all the  <dig> annotated bidirectional gene pairs, we found  <dig> pairs  of them having functional similarity  and  <dig> pairs having no functional similarity , whereas the counterpart number in the  <dig> random pairs are  <dig>  and  <dig>  such a difference is significant with a p value  <dig>  × 10- <dig> if we use a binomial background distribution, which supports the hypothesis that bidirectional genes are more likely to be functionally associated than randomly paired genes.

coexpression levels on groups with different functional similarity
using the  <dig> random pairs' pearson correlation coefficients as background distribution, we calculated p values of correlation coefficients of bidirectional gene pairs . lower p values mean more correlated in expression. we denoted pairs with functional similarities equal to  <dig> from the  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs as group one and functional similarities equal to  <dig> as group two. table  <dig> – coexpression levels on different groups. gives the proportion of coexpressed pairs in different groups. group one is significantly more correlated in expression  while group two is less significant  with a binomial distribution model. this result indicates that bidirectional gene pairs having functional similarity exhibit stronger expression correlations, which is consistent with  <cit> .

ratio means the percentage of more correlated pairs in expression 

identification of transcriptional regulatory region 
in previous studies, putative bidirectional promoters are defined as intergenic regions between tsss with not more than  <dig> base pairs long. however, a region designated like that may not contain functional promoters since promoters can locate faraway from tsss, and the two genes may locate "head-to-head" closely along genome by a chance. beware of this and because of the difficulties for experimental verifications of promoters, we further scrutinize the dna sequences between the bidirectional genes by hsl we recently developed to see if these sequences contain potential functional regulatory regions .

we scanned the dna sequences between bidirectional genes by hsl and assigned a trr score for each position indicating the likelihood of the position-centered region being a transcriptional regulatory region . we chose threshold of trr score  <dig> for arabidopsis thaliana . we found that most  of the intergenic regions between bidirectional genes with high trr scores contain only one score peak, suggesting that the bidirectional genes share common promoter for transcription initiation.

functional similarity on high scoring trr group and low scoring trr group
using the hsl program, we can divide all the  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs into two groups, high scoring group , and low scoring group . the percentage of pairs having functional similarity is  <dig> % in the high scoring group, whereas  <dig> % in the low trr scoring group which is similar to that in random pairs . the high scoring group is more functionally associated than the two other groups dominantly. simply modeling a binomial distribution on random pairs' function similarity, bidirectional gene pairs with trr >=  <dig> are significantly correlated functionally with a p value  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  while low scoring group is not functionally associated at all . bidirectional gene pairs have been confirmed more functionally associated by others  <cit> . however, bidirectional gene pairs with trr <  <dig> are even worse than randomly paired genes  in functional association and this implies us that bidirectional gene pairs in low scoring group are just close in position accidentally, without anything about biological correlation in co-regulation. meanwhile, bidirectional gene pairs with trr >=  <dig> are more dominantly associated functionally, suggesting they are more probably regulated divergently by a common promoter region through sharing essential regulatory elements working cooperatively.

ratio means the percentage of pairs with higher functional similarity

predicting potential functional bidirectional promoters
trinklein et al concluded that the majority of bidirectional promoters regulate the coexpression of a bidirectional gene pair  <cit> , so gene pairs being more correlated in expression may be co-regulated by common bidirectional promoters. table  <dig> – coexpression levels on different groups. shows that bidirectional gene pairs having functional similarity exhibit stronger expression correlations, suggesting that functionally associated bidirectional gene pairs are probably co-regulated divergently by common bidirectional promoter. as described above, functionally associated bidirectional gene pairs with high trr scores are probably regulated by common regulatory elements taking effects cooperatively. therefore, we hypothesized that a functionally associated bidirectional gene pair with higher trr score is probably co-regulated by a common promoter region through essential regulatory elements reacting on both genes cooperatively, and regarded the intergenic regions between them as potential functional bidirectional promoters. the correlation coefficient of expression was not taken into consideration due to the following reasons. firstly, coexpression of a pair is not conserved under different experimental conditions. secondly, the microarray data is often incomplete and we could not compute out all the correlation coefficients we want. according to the criteria of both having functional similarity and trr score above  <dig>  we predicted  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs to be regulated by common bidirectional promoters .

go: <dig> cc
pair <dig> and pair <dig> represent the loci of two genes in a bidirectional gene pair, and "cc", "mf" and "bp" are acronyms of "cellular component", "molecular function" and "biological process"

among these  <dig> gene pairs, we found for each of five pairs , the bidirectional genes contain the same functional protein domains and also share same orthologs from nematode, yeast and fungi, which are evolutionally more ancient than a. thaliana . the results indicate that genes in each of these five pairs are derived from a common ancestor into two genes during evolution.

of the  <dig> bidirectional gene pairs, five pairs  sharing the same two go terms go: <dig> and go: <dig>  five pairs  sharing the same go term go: <dig>  two pairs  sharing go: <dig>  two pairs  sharing go: <dig>  two pairs  sharing go: <dig> and two pairs  sharing go: <dig>  there are  <dig> go terms being shared by identified bidirectional promoters in total, and most of these go terms are supported by previous studies. guarcuaglini et al found that murine ranbp <dig> and htf9-c genes is regulated from a shared bidirectional promoter during cell cycle progression  <cit> . the mouse genome informatics  database annotates htf9-c with go:  <dig>  which is listed in table  <dig> – true bidirectional promoters we predict.  <cit> . thymidine kinase  is a growth factor inducible enzyme that is highly expressed in proliferating mammalian cells. expression of mouse tk mrna is controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms including antisense transcription. schuettengruber et al had identified a novel gene which is divergently transcribed from the bidirectional tk promoter, encoding kynenurine formamidase , an enzyme of the tryptophan metabolism  <cit> . murine gene tk is annotated in go: <dig>  which is also in our prediction list by mgi annotation. our prediction can also be supported by evidences in human genome. xu et al concluded that the expression of human genes nbr <dig> and brca <dig> are co-ordinated through a bidirectional promoter  <cit> , and wu et al confirmed that brca <dig> have function go: <dig>  which is shared by pair  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . human genes prkdc and mcm <dig> are divergently transcribed and located at chromosome  <dig> band q <dig>  <cit> . gene prkdc is annotated in go: <dig>   <cit>  which is a son node of go: <dig>  in our prediction. whereas mcm <dig> is covered by go: <dig>  which is shared by pair 1– <dig> through the annotation of gene ontology. besides that, momota et al found that human genes col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> coding for the human alpha <dig> and alpha <dig> collagen chains are arranged head-to-head on chromosome 2q <dig>  <cit> , while col4a <dig> is annotated in go: <dig>  by raya et al  <cit> . bellizzi et al confirmed that two human genes sirt <dig> and psmd <dig> shared one bidirectional promoter  <cit> , while gene psmd <dig> is covered by go: <dig>  through the annotation of gene ontology  <cit> , which is a grandchildren of go:  <dig>  we also predicted. besides that, we find two genes from one bidirectional gene pair which is with lower trr score not regulated by common bidirectional promoter. the two genes at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> constituting one bidirectional pair are located on chromosome  <dig> with a  <dig> base pairs long sequence separating them and the trr score of this pair is  <dig> , less than threshold  <dig>  at3g <dig> is a heat shock gene  <cit> , expression of which is regulated by heat stress transcriptional factors , while at3g <dig> encodes pentatricopeptide repeat  protein. geddy and brown  <cit>  revealed genes encoding ppr proteins are not conserved in location in arabidopsis genomes and may be subject to diversifying selection. all these examples have been confirmed experimentally or by literature, providing a convincing support of our hypothesis. the five nodes go: <dig>  go: <dig>  go: <dig>  go:000- <dig> and go: <dig> annotated most of genes mentioned above and also covered more than half of gene pairs we predicted in table  <dig> – true bidirectional promoters we predict.

discussion
bidirectional gene organization is reported existing in mammalian genomes by many literatures <cit> , but no genome-wide study of bidirectional genes for plant genome. we perform a systematic survey for the bidirectional genes in arabidopsis thaliana and find this head-to-head gene structure is also very common, about  <dig> % of the all the a. thaliana genes are arranged in such architectural features. similarly to other studies  <cit> , bidirectional genes are more correlated in expression and associated in function. furthermore we find that bidirectional gene pairs sharing similar functions exhibit stronger expression correlations.

in previous studies, the intergenic region between two transcription start sites  of a bidirectional gene pair is commonly designated as a putative bidirectional promoter. however, it is not clear whether this region has regulatory activity, or enriched of regulatory elements which are essential for initiation of transcription. we scanned the intergenic sequences by hsl and assigned a trr score of it to make sure it contains transcriptional regulatory regions or not. it's interesting that most of the intergenic regions of bidirectional genes with high trr scores contain only one score peak, suggesting that the bidirectional genes share common promoter for transcription initiation. statistical results showed that functionally associated bidirectional gene pairs with high trr scores are probably regulated by common regulatory elements taking effects cooperatively.

if we restrict ourselves to the high scored trrs with functional associated bidirectional genes, we obtain  <dig> gene pairs,  <dig> pairs of which may be involved in the same biological process and share common orthlogs from nematode, yeast and fungi. surprisingly, almost all of them limited to several go functions such as atp binding et al., and most of them are supported by previous studies.

CONCLUSIONS
individual examples of divergently transcribed gene pairs have been found for years, most of which concern human genome  <cit>  or mammalian genome  <cit> , but corresponding results on plants are rarely reported. we conducted a systematic analysis of bidirectional gene pairs for arabidopsis thaliana genome. we found that bidirectional gene pairs account for a large proportion  of all the a. thaliana genes, confirming that this structure is also prevalent in plant genome. similarly to other studies, we found that bidirectional gene pairs are more correlated in expression and associated functionally. furthermore, we also perform systematic promoter activity analysis. we evaluated whether the putative bidirectional promoter regions are enriched of regulatory elements which are essential for promoter function and finally predicted  <dig> pairs of bidirectional genes which share common bidirectional promoters more probably. five of them have the same functions for sharing common ancient orthologs, and in addition, more than half of them are further supported by sharing the same functional categories  as these of handful experimental verified bidirectional genes in other organisms. these results significantly expanded the knowledge of "head-to-head" gene organization in plant genome and our work provides a new approach for further study of bidirectional genes in other genomes.
