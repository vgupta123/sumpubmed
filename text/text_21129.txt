BACKGROUND
for many years, our understanding of the phylogeny of escherichia coli, a diverse group of pathogenic and commensal organisms, has been based on multilocus enzyme electrophoresis   <cit>  patterns of the strains in the e. coli reference collection   <cit> . mlee demonstrated subspecific clonal structure within e. coli  <cit>  and formed the basis for parsing this collection  into one minor  and four major  groups. these divisions often correlate with pathogenicity or niche  <cit> .

multilocus sequence typing, which uses allelic variations in a sample of housekeeping genes distributed around the chromosome, and whole genome sequencing have been increasingly used to study e. coli phylogeny. however, these circumchromosomal sequence datasets generate incongruent phylogenetic topologies. for example, mlst frequently identifies group b <dig> as being the first to branch from the phylogenetic tree, and groups a and b <dig> as 'sister' groups that branch most recently. in contrast, mlee places groups b <dig> and b <dig> in a proximal branching position and group a branches more distally  <cit> . single gene phylogenies also fail to converge on a single topology  <cit> , place either group d or b <dig> as being the first to branch, and usually do not result in monophyletic groups  <cit> . mlst additionally demonstrates paraphyly for groups a or b <dig> in some analyses  <cit> , or portrays strains as hybrids  <cit> . different relationships can be generated from mlst data by varying the choice of outgroup, the stringency of recombination detection  <cit> , or the phylogenetic methodology  <cit> . a thorough analysis of the core genomes of  <dig>  genes in  <dig> e. coli strains indicate an early bifurcation of e. coli into group b <dig> and a group d subgroup on one fork, and a second subgroup of group d and all other strains on the other, inferring paraphyly within group d  <cit> . gordon, et al  <cit>  apply several different but unrooted mlst analyses to a large number of e. coli. their unrooted analysis cannot illuminate the order of emergence, but provides multiple different portrayals of group relatedness. these disparate approaches have failed to resolve the topology of emergence of this species.

we attempted to produce a more cogent picture of the emergence of e. coli by studying backbone dna. backbone  dna  <cit>  was initially defined as the regions of the chromosome of one of the first sequenced e. coli o157:h <dig> strain edl <dig> that are homologous with the non-pathogenic laboratory strain k- <dig>  thus by definition lacking pathogenicity islands and mobile elements such as prophages  <cit> . we selected four extended length  backbone segments in four different quadrants of the chromosome in strains belonging to different ecor groups . we chose this strategy for three reasons: first, backbone dna is relatively uncontaminated by horizontally acquired dna such as pathogenicity islands , which could have evolutionary histories quite independent of their host bacteria  <cit> . second, long segments of nucleotides are more likely to generate bootstrap confidence values for node placement that are higher than those produced by more limited datasets . third, the separation of the studied segments provides information relevant to the overall phylogenetic topology of the species.

RESULTS
phylogenetic topology of e. coli
in most topologies , sd, nj, me, and mp phylogenetic techniques recapitulated the major groupings of e. coli as have been defined by mlee and mlst. however, in some portrayals, group e appears as an offshoot of group a  or group d is paraphyletic . for segment  <dig>  all four methods produce a single congruent topology  . for segments  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  two or three different, i.e., incongruent, topologies emerged . most notably, we found no congruencies between the topologies ordained by the same phylogenetic methods when these analyses were applied to different segments . the confidence bootstrap values  of these phylogenies cover a spectrum of magnitude , but generally exceed those produced by mlst  <cit> .

the choice of segment influenced the inferred topology to a greater extent than did the method used to construct the phylogeny. this is surprising, because phylogeny should be a property of organisms, and not vary as a function of the dna segment scrutinized. most likely, circumchromosomal datasets produce net topologies weighted by the differing evolutionary and recombination histories of components of the chromosome. in other words, the phylogenetic history of e. coli becomes less clear as more sequence data are entered into analysis.

inter-group recombination
next, we used geneconv  <cit> , a program that compares orthologous dna and identifies regions that have been acquired by recombination, to identify among the four extended segments a total of  <dig> inter-group exchanges . of these  <dig> exchanges,  <dig> were 'duplicates', where two or more regions identified by geneconv had identical borders. such conversions probably represent transfer of dna from a single strain in one group to a single strain in another group before lineages diverged in the recipient group. of the remaining  <dig> converted segments,  <dig> overlapped partially with at least one other exchanged fragment .

we used three increasingly stringent tiers of analysis to determine if the exchanges between groups occurred randomly . for tier  <dig>  we considered all  <dig> exchanges as independent events, and identified disproportionate  conversions between groups b <dig> and d, a and b <dig> , and a and e . for tier  <dig>  we assigned duplicate conversions of fragments with identical borders as single events, and again found statistically significant non-random associations between groups b <dig> and d, a and b <dig> , and a and e  for the  <dig> such non-duplicated inter-group exchanges. for tier  <dig>  we counted any and all inter-group recombination events once and only once for any segment, because most recombined fragments overlap to some extent. among the  <dig> such occurrences, the four b2/d and two a/e pairings were overrepresented . these different conversion enumeration strategies each suggest that dna exchange was restricted to a subset of all possible pairings.

intra-group recombination was more frequent than inter-group exchange. among the  <dig> intra-group and  <dig> inter-group strain to strain opportunities for pairings, geneconv identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  intra-group and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  inter-group recombination events for tier  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> exchanges, respectively. the chi square and two-tailed approximate p values for tier  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> inter- vs. intra-group comparisons are  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.

discussion
our data prompt two questions: first, how can the robust recombination that occurred in e. coli's distant past  <cit>  be reconciled with the restricted recombination among extant groups? second, can the restricted recombination that we demonstrated across four segments from different quadrants of the chromosome be harmonized with the concept that members of the same species readily exchange dna  <cit> ? in answer to these questions, we propose that for much of its existence, e. coli exchanged dna freely between groups as evidenced by its convoluted phylogeny. however, as the five lineages that formed each phylogroup continued to evolve and differentiate, their abilities to receive and/or to donate dna diminished, and the exchange of chromosomal dna among extant e. coli is now largely dormant. mechanisms for exchange restriction might include limited opportunities for interactions between groups as their members occupy particular niches  or organism-specific factors  hinder conversions.

the durability of the nonrandom exchange of dna between groups could determine the fate of e. coli. if these conversion patterns become increasingly restricted, there could be involution of the ability to exchange chromosomal dna across the entire species. alternatively, if these networks are durable, groups b <dig> and d, and possibly groups a, b <dig>  and e, could now be coalescing,  as nascent species, in which case inter-group recombination will persist for these sets. this latter scenario would resemble the early fragmentation of an ancestral species into e. coli and salmonella  <cit> . however, recombinational dormancy is only one explanation for our findings, and confirmation or refutation will require larger datasets, using, as we note above, optimally representative strain sets.

the disproportionately high intra-group recombination rates strengthen the case for highly restricted recombination networks between sets of organisms, as suggested by other investigators. for example, the patterns in figure  <dig> resemble gene-sharing "highways"  <cit>  between distantly related bacteria, and our intra-species analysis suggests this process applies within e. coli. such networking also appears among penicillin resistant pneumococci  <cit> .

the appropriateness of defining bacterial species based on net dna homology has been questioned  <cit> , but there remains concurrence that members of a species should exchange dna  <cit> . statistical comparisons of open reading frames suggest a recent and unexpected slowing of dna exchange between enteric bacteria belonging to different species  <cit> . our findings now raise the possibility that dna exchange is also recently constrained within a single species, i.e., e. coli, a taxonomic rank that should, according to mayrian theory  <cit> , tolerate recombination.

our study has several limitations. it is possible that the predominantly human origin of our strain set introduced biases. however, isolation of the e. coli from humans does not mean that these organisms are adapted to humans. specifically, urinary and meningitis isolates occupied bladder, kidney, or meningeal niches only briefly before they were recovered, and their prior venues are unknown. e. coli o157:h <dig> infection of humans is incidental and quite ephemeral; these human enteric pathogens are much better adapted to the ruminant gut. microbial phylogenetic studies should ideally use minimally biased, globally representative strain samples. however, until such a sample set is assembled, we remain reliant on strain sets of variable convenience, and must acknowledge that they might produce misleading interpretations regarding microbial membership in a given niche. also, fragmentation of e. coli into limited recombination networks could be related to the recent entry into the species niche from which they were recovered. such entry is soon followed by clonal expansion, and increased opportunities for recombination with other occupants, but the surge does not reflect evolutionarily-driven emergence. indeed, walk, et al  <cit> , used mlst  to study e. coli with "noticeably divergent sequences" and most of their phylogenetic outliers were from non-human sources. this finding lends credence to the possibility that recent expansion in human niches leads to recovery opportunity and biases, and that human-based strains might offer an incomplete picture of the broader species. however, this study of largely environmental strains could also reflect strain selection biases if they comprised only a small minority of non-human isolates in the collection. we also acknowledge that the segments chosen might be at variance from the true evolutionary history of the chromosome. however, the inclusion criteria balanced our need to select segments that were of sufficient length to identify recombination, that were widely separated on the chromosome thereby providing validity to and generalizing our findings, and that were not abundantly interrupted by non-backbone dna, which might have introduced pro-recombinational biases. moreover, the analysis of segments  <dig> and  <dig>  validated the data from initial data segments  <dig> and  <dig>  these measures reduce the likelihood that we inadvertently introduced a bias for certain kinds of genes that are more or less likely to have undergone recombination  <cit> . additionally, it is likely that all species are gradually radiating, but our data raise the possibility that extant e. coli, after evolving from a set of organisms that were a species , are at or near a point where we might consider their coalescence into new species. an additional caveat when considering our findings is that we purposely focused on the core  genome, and did not enter into analysis dna that had been clearly acquired by lateral gene transfer. it is known that such horizontally transferred dna is readily exchanged between organisms that are quite distantly related, even belonging to different species, and we wished to retain focus on the stable portion of the chromosome. we had hoped to resolve differences in phylogeny by the reductionist approach of extended length segment analysis, but the variably discordant phylogenies suggest to us that at least at present the problem cannot be solved: the e. coli chromosome "chassis" has parts with too many origins to assign the emergence scenario of the whole with confidence. our data do prompt us to propose that future phylogenetic analyses address disproportionate contributions from recently acquired, or very long, segments of chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
it is currently problematic to use circumchromosomal sequence data to develop an unambiguous emergence topology for e. coli. most likely, e. coli's legacy of recombination  <cit>  hinders such attempts to discern a cogent phylogeny, as predicted two decades ago by dykhuizen and green  <cit> . it will be tempting to use whole genome sequences to construct phylogenies of other microbes, but our findings from e. coli suggest that depending on the phylogenetic questions asked, there are optimal sizes of datasets to provide the answers. indeed, more  sequence might, counter-intuitively, offer less clarity in trying to discern species topology. e. coli might now be in an epoch of recombinational dormancy. the few non-random conversion patterns we identified could represent new species emerging, or, alternatively, vestigial recombination capabilities between existing groups, if the ability to exchange dna is slowing, among the set of organisms we know as e. coli.
