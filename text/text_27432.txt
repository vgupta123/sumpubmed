BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori, a gram negative bacterium, is a highly host-adapted gastric pathogen that has been implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from gastritis to adenocarcinoma  <cit> . although this bacterium colonizes the gastric mucosa of billions of people, only 20% of the infected people become symptomatic. the disparities of symptoms from one person to another are indicative of a pathogen with significant genetic diversity. two major types of diversity have been described in h. pylori clinical isolates: i) macrohetereogeneity, in which large chromosomal regions vary from strain to strain, and ii) microheterogeneity, in which individual genes feature sequence diversity. examples of macroheterogeneity include the presence or absence of the cag pathogenicity island, insertion sequences, and a hypervariable region containing about half of the strain-specific genes, called the plasticity zone  <cit> . furthermore, 22% of the organism's genes are dispensable in one or more strains, leading to a core of only about  <dig> genes  <cit> . macroheterogeneity can be assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphisms, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and microarrays.

examples of microheterogeneity include extensive sequence variation of the vaca, caga, baba, hopq, icea genes and other genes  <cit> . for example, the vaca gene encoding the vacuolating cytotoxin  exhibits a remarkable degree of genotypic and phenotypic variation  <cit> . the vacuolating activity of vaca varies approximately 30-fold across different isolates due to the presence of at least five different vaca alleles  <cit> . two families of the vaca alleles, type m <dig> and type m <dig>  are only about 70% identical  <cit> . in addition, there is also evidence that mixed strain infections can occur in a single patient  <cit> , and that a single strain can change in vivo over time  <cit> . the extraordinary diversity of this pathogen may explain why the acquired immune response cannot clear the infection or prevent reinfection by a heterologous strain. the genetic variation among the bacterium's virulence factors may relate to the diverse disease manifestations in patients, although this is not well understood.

on the other hand, the urease structural proteins, urea and ureb, are very well conserved across heterologous strains of h. pylori . these proteins constitute a nickel-requiring, highly abundant metalloenzyme that is central to the pathogenesis of the bacterium  <cit> . urease hydrolyzes urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia, the latter of which neutralizes gastric acid  <cit> . local neutralization of gastric acid helps h. pylori to safely traverse the gastric mucosal layer and colonize the gastric epithelium  <cit> . indeed, urease mutants are unable to colonize and establish a lasting infection in nude mice and gnotobiotic piglets  <cit> . considering that functional urease is absolutely essential for virulence, numerous random mutations in the functional core of the urease gene could be detrimental, thus explaining why urea and ureb are highly conserved in heterologous strains. without stability in these two structural genes, this species would be ineffective as a pathogen.

the source of urea for h. pylori urease can either be through host- or bacterial-derived arginase. h. pylori contains the rocf gene encoding arginase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of l-arginine to l-ornithine and urea  <cit> . h. pylori is deficient in the enzymes for synthesizing arginine de novo and is therefore dependent on host arginine to help it maintain nitrogen balance  <cit> . arginase consumes arginine, thereby removing this essential amino acid away from other cellular processes if the enzyme activity is too high. the role of arginase in h. pylori pathogenesis is beginning to be unraveled. arginase allows the bacterium to evade host immune response by competing with macrophage inducible nitric oxide synthase  for l-arginine  <cit> . h. pylori arginase also down-regulates expression of cd3ς on t-cells, preventing their proliferation via consumption of arginine from the extracellular milieu  <cit> . moreover, arginase produces endogenous urea that can be hydrolyzed by urease to produce ammonium that contributes to acid resistance  <cit> . thus, arginase is involved in helping h. pylori evade both the innate  and adaptive  immune systems. arginase clearly plays a role in these pathogenic processes, but surprisingly the rocf gene encoding arginase is not essential for the establishment of infection  <cit> , suggesting that in vivo the enzyme plays a role downstream of the initial colonization step, perhaps modulating disease severity.

the importance of specific mutations in the phenotypic variation of this species are largely unknown. the evolution of specific genes and proteins in this pathogen are of paramount importance as the field strives to understand the role of specific genes in virulence. in a previous study involving laboratory-adapted strains, some variation in arginase activity was found among three strains  <cit> . however, it was not determined whether this variation occurred from spontaneous mutation from passaging the strains repeatedly in the laboratory or from natural diversity existing among h. pylori strains. to determine arginase variability, phenotypic and genotypic analyses of rocf in  <dig> minimally-passaged clinical isolates and six laboratory-adapted strains was investigated. while most previous studies on microheterogeneity focused on only a small portion of a gene, we studied the entire arginase coding region plus upstream region. this study demonstrates that extensive microheterogeneity exists in the rocf gene, with phenotypic manifestations, and provides evidence that this gene may serve as a model to study microheterogeneity in h. pylori.

RESULTS
variation of arginase activity in clinical isolates of h. pylori
previously, a modest  <dig> -fold variability in arginase activity was reported in three laboratory-adapted strains of h. pylori  <cit> . in this study, the potential variability of arginase activity was examined in much more detail using  <dig> minimally-passaged clinical isolates of h. pylori from patients with different disease manifestations and from different geographical locations . the clinical isolates have been passaged fewer than five times on laboratory media and therefore their arginase activity would be closer to that found in vivo. six laboratory-adapted strains  were used as controls. arginase activities of extracts from h. pylori strains revealed dramatic variations exceeding 100-fold among the isolates . three different categories could be arbitrarily assigned to the isolates: high activity , intermediate activity , and low activity . for nearly all strains, arginase activity remained constant within experimental error for each strain following three consecutive passages. however, repeated passaging of several strains over the period of seven to nine days, changed their arginase activity, with some increasing  and some decreasing  . no clear correlation could be made between arginase activity and disease status of the patient, although the number of isolates available for certain diseases types  was too low to determine significant correlations.

to determine whether an alternative growth medium also resulted in variable arginase activity, h. pylori strains were grown in ham's f- <dig> broth and corresponding extracts assayed for arginase activity. arginase activity also varies in broth, depending on the strain, but there was a strong correlation  between arginase activity of a particular strain in broth versus agar . in other words, strains with low arginase activity on agar also had low arginase activity in broth.

although we previously determined that rocf mutants of h. pylori have wild type levels of urease activity  <cit> , we sought to determine whether arginase and urease activities correlated, using a larger number of strains. twelve clinical isolates of h. pylori were measured for urease activity and compared with arginase activity. notably, there was more than 25-fold variation in urease activity among clinical isolates examined . variation in urease activity in fresh clinical isolates was 3–10-fold in previous studies using less sensitive urease activity methods  <cit> . there was no correlation whatsoever between urease and arginase activities  . for example, some strains had low arginase but high urease activties while other strains had low activities of both enzymes.

e. coli expressing the arginase gene from different h. pylori clinical isolates displays variable activity
the variation in arginase enzyme activity observed in h. pylori could be due to sequence differences in the arginase protein itself or in other loci which may affect the enzyme. to eliminate the genetic variability of other h. pylori loci as a compounding factor, arginase activity was assessed in the genetically stable e. coli model developed previously  <cit> . the arginase gene with its native promoter from  <dig> of the strains used in this study, representing low, intermediate and high arginase activities, was cloned into pbluescript and arginase activity measured in transformed e. coli. . remarkably, arginase activity depended on the particular arginase gene cloned into e. coli, with a greater than 100-fold magnitude of variation . surprisingly, there was absolutely no correlation  between the arginase activity from e. coli containing a particular rocf gene and the arginase activity of the h. pylori strain from which the rocf gene was cloned . for example, h. pylori strain a <dig> has almost no detectable arginase activity, yet the rocf gene from this strain conferred arginase activity to e. coli. h. pylori strain a <dig> has one of the highest arginase activities among all the clinical isolates , yet its arginase gene conferred among the lowest arginase activities to e. coli. thus, the data also raise the possibility that there are strain-specific h. pylori loci that modulate arginase activity. we hesitate to make other firm conclusions due to plasmid copy number effects potentially having an influence on the arginase activity levels observed.

evidence for strain-specific regulation of h. pylori arginase activity
disruption of the rocf gene results in abolishment of arginase activity  <cit> . a new chromosomal complementation system for h. pylori that targets the hp0203- <dig> intergenic region demonstrated that the arginase mutant of strain  <dig> could be complemented for arginase activity  <cit> .

three plasmids, pmlb <dig>  pmlb <dig>  and pmlb <dig> carry the wild type rocf genes from h. pylori strains  <dig>  ss <dig> and j <dig>  respectively. these suicide plasmids were transformed into the rocf mutant of  <dig> and confirmed to yield  <dig> rocf-mlb <dig>  -mlb <dig>  and -mlb <dig>  <cit> . the arginase activity of these three complemented strains was compared to that of the corresponding wild type h. pylori strain from which the rocf gene was derived. when the rocf genes from strains  <dig> or ss <dig> were used to complement the  <dig> rocf mutant, arginase activity was restored to levels similar to that of the corresponding wild-type  <dig> or ss <dig> strains . in contrast, when the rocf gene from strain j <dig> was used to complement the  <dig> rocf mutant, arginase activity was about ten times higher than that of the corresponding wild-type j <dig> strain . this finding raises the intriguing possibility that there is strain-dependent regulation of arginase.

additional evidence for strain-dependent arginase activity was revealed from strains ss <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  which all have identical rocf coding regions and upstream regions, yet have different arginase activities  .

evidence that h. pylori prefers low to moderate arginase activity
the arginase activity data from clinical isolates revealed that most strains possess intermediate or low arginase activities, while only a few strains have high activity, with only one strain above  <dig>  u . if h. pylori did not control arginase activity, then a strain with two functional chromosomal copies of the arginase gene should have an enzyme activity significantly higher than the wild type strain carrying only a single arginase gene. to investigate this plasmid pmlb <dig>  which confers arginase activity to an arginase negative strain, was transformed into the high arginase activity strain, ss <dig>  to yield two chromosomal copies of wild-type rocf , designated ss <dig> mlb <dig>  <cit> . as an isogenic control, the same construct devoid of the arginase gene  was transformed into ss <dig> to yield ss <dig> 203c <dig>  <cit> . rather than the predicted 100% increase, strain ss <dig> mlb <dig> had only about 25% more arginase activity over that of the isogenic control ss <dig> 203c <dig> strain . this suggests that h. pylori has mechanisms to prevent arginase activity from becoming too high.

western blot analysis of arginase in clinical isolates of h. pylori
western blot analysis with rocf antiserum showed that extracts from h. pylori strains with high arginase activity  had relatively higher amounts of arginase protein , than most strains with lower arginase activity . there were occasional exceptions; strain j <dig>  for example, had low arginase activity, but high amounts of arginase protein . it was difficult to detect arginase protein in some of the lowest arginase activity strains, such as strains a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> . two strains whose arginase activity changed upon laboratory passage , likewise showed corresponding changes in the amount of arginase protein . the arginase protein size by sds-page was found to vary slightly among the minimally-passaged clinical isolates; this size variation did not correlate with arginase activity  . despite slight size variations, all rocf genes were predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid protein. the size variation was not considered significant enough to study further.

nucleotide, amino acid and phylogenetic analyses of rocf/rocf
to understand better the arginase nucleotide sequence variations, strains representing low, intermediate and high arginase activity were selected for further analysis. pcr amplification was performed on  <dig> different arginase genes, each giving a  <dig>  kb fragment, which was cloned and sequenced. pairwise alignments of the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> strains  revealed that the rocf coding sequences  were  <dig> % to 100% identical to that of strain  <dig> . within the region encoding the arginase putative cobalt-binding site, dahad , two corresponding nucleotide changes were observed: gac to gat  and gcg to gct . in both cases, the mutations were silent, leading to no changes in the amino acid sequence. alignments also revealed a hypervariable region in the upstream sequence proximal to the atg start codon . the region between nucleotides - <dig> to + <dig> ranged from only 67% to 100% identity with strain  <dig> . ten different sites showed mutations; insertions and deletions also occurred in this hypervariable region . interestingly, some of the mutations, insertions and deletions, occurred near or in the predicted shine-dalgarno sequence   . intriguingly, the arginase upstream region from the recently sequenced h. pylori strain ag <dig>  <cit>  had no homology with that of any of the arginase upstream regions studied here . instead, the arginase upstream region of strain ag <dig> showed striking resemblance  to that of the arginase upstream region of h. acinonychis  <cit>  . in contrast, the arginase upstream sequence from the remaining  <dig> h. pylori strains studied here did not bear any homology to any region in the h. acinonychis genome .

pairwise alignments of the translated rocf coding regions showed that they were 92% to 100% identical, with most variability located near the carboxy terminus . there were  <dig> amino acid residues out of  <dig>  that were not 100% conserved across all the isolates. of these  <dig>   <dig> of the variable residues are found in the last  <dig> amino acids, with nine of these variable sites being in the final  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminal end. three strains, ss <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig>  were 100% identical at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. strains hpdjm <dig> and j <dig> had five amino acid differences. all h. pylori rocf proteins were predicted to have  <dig> amino acids.

a phylogenetic tree of the arginase proteins from  <dig> h. pylori strains revealed four clades, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> strain in the clades . a phylogenetic tree of the nucleotide sequences of the arginase upstream region from  <dig> h. pylori strains  showed three major clades containing one, fifteen and six strains, respectively . the two phylogenetic trees  showed little congruence with each other. for example, the rocf protein from strains  <dig> and a <dig> were within the same clade, but the corresponding rocf upstream regions were in different clades. two strains showing 100% identity in the arginase upstream region were strains g <dig> and b <dig>  two of the highest arginase activity strains  . these two strains did not have identical coding regions, showing 96% identity at the amino acid level. three other strains were 100% identical in the upstream region: b <dig>  ss <dig>  and b <dig> . these three strains were also 100% identical at the amino acid level , yet had different levels of arginase activity . this provided additional evidence that a strain-specific locus other than rocf plays a role in some of the variability observed. no clear correlation could be made between phylogenetic placement on either of the trees  and the level of arginase activity .

serine  <dig> in rocf is required for arginase activity
no information is available regarding the amino acids in h. pylori rocf that are responsible for catalytic activity. the clinical isolate a <dig> had barely detectable arginase activity  we designate as arginase null . the arginase gene and protein sequences were directly compared to that of a strain with much higher arginase activity,  <dig>  alignment of the ~ <dig> bp rocf upstream sequences of both strains revealed nine differences , but none of the changes in strain a <dig> could be correlated to an arginase null phenotype, since these changes were found in other arginase upstream regions in strains with detectable arginase activity. an additional  <dig> bp further upstream of these two strains was next analyzed and shown to be 100% identical . the involvement of these upstream sequences in affecting the arginase null phenotype of strain a <dig> could not be completely ruled out. next, the rocf amino acid sequences of strains a <dig> and  <dig> were aligned, revealing  <dig> amino acid differences . all but three of these amino acid differences were found in arginase proteins from other strains of h. pylori that had detectable arginase activity, suggesting the other eight residues were not involved in the original arginase null phenotype of strain a <dig>  the roles of the remaining three amino acids  in arginase activity were investigated in rocf from strain  <dig> using site-directed mutagenesis. each of these residues was mutated from the wild type  <dig> sequence to the a <dig> sequence in pqe30-rocf  <cit> : isoleucine  <dig> was mutated to methionine , serine  <dig> was mutated to isoleucine , and aspartate  <dig> was mutated to asparagine . arginase activity was measured from crude extracts prepared from e. coli harboring these plasmid derivatives. plasmid pqe <dig> served as the negative control and the original wild type pqe30-rocf   <cit>  served as the positive control. arginase activity data indicated that the i174m and d257n mutations had no major effect on the activity of the enzyme. strikingly, arginase activity in extracts from the strain carrying the s232i mutation strain was abolished, with no activity above the negative control strain carrying pqe <dig> . western blot analysis using anti-rocf antiserum revealed that the amount of expressed arginase protein in the s232i mutant was similar to that of wild type  <dig> rocf expressed from pqe30-rocf , indicating that the s232i mutated form of the protein was properly expressed. however, a more pronounced degradation of rocf  compared with the wild type rocf was noted.

discussion
in this study the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of arginase in  <dig> clinical isolates and six laboratory-adapted strains of h. pylori was investigated. phenotypically, arginase activity varied more than 100-fold in both h. pylori  and the e. coli model . nearly all of the h. pylori strains featured intermediate or low arginase activities . of the five strains with the highest arginase activity, four were laboratory strains that have been passaged heavily. notably, even the highest arginase activity strains  have specific activities more than 10-fold lower than those measured for other bacterial and eukaryotic arginases . arginine is a critical amino acid for several cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, and h. pylori absolutely requires arginine for growth  <cit> . the bacterium would rapidly hydrolyze the arginine if it had a high specific activity arginase, potentially depleting intracellular pools and starving itself of this essential amino acid. the few high arginase activity h. pylori strains may have compensatory mechanisms to overcome potential arginine starvation from the higher level of arginine hydrolysis. two possible mechanisms are that the high arginase activity strains might have a higher affinity arginine transporter that would allow higher intracellular accumulation of arginine. alternatively, the high arginase activity strains could have decreased arginine decarboxylase activity, another arginine-consuming enzyme that could also cause arginine depletion in h. pylori.

h. pylori is a heterogeneous species  <cit>  that features diversity at many levels. for example, there are many contingency genes that undergo phase variation through dna slipped-strand mispairing of repeats, such as lps biosynthesis genes, and genes encoding outer-membrane proteins  <cit> . as another example of diversity, adhesion of h. pylori to fucosylated lewis b antigens on the surface of the gastric epithelium appears to be dependent on variability of the baba gene. this gene shows much conservation in the 5' and 3' regions but large variability in its midregions  <cit> . the caga gene, encoded by the cag pathogenicity island, exhibits nucleotide sequences that are  <dig> % conserved, with much diversity at the 3' end where an epiya amino acid repeat element is encoded  <cit> . rocf also features diversity in its c-terminal region, although there are no repeat elements. rocf appears to more divergent than urease subunits a and b, but less divergent than caga or vaca. since rocf participates in various aspects of h. pylori pathogenesis  <cit>  and the gene displays remarkable heterogeneity shown in this study, it is possible that rocf heterogeneity may correlate with specific aspects of the pathogenesis of the bacterium, such as inhibition of nitric oxide production and t-cell proliferation. the data obtained do not provide evidence for a correlation between arginase activity and urease activity or between arginase activity and the disease status of the patient, although more isolates would need to be studied since there were few isolates available for certain disease categories. moreover, a greater geographic distribution of strains also would be necessary.

the data support the hypothesis that some h. pylori strains may have strain-specific arginase gene regulation. for example, strain a <dig> has minimal to no detectable arginase activity in the native h. pylori strain, but significant activity was detected in e. coli transformed with the a <dig> rocf gene, suggesting that h. pylori strain a <dig> has an arginase repressor. such a repressor may be inoperative, inefficient, or absent in high arginase activity strains such as  <dig>  additionally, evidence for potential strain-specific arginase regulation was observed in h. pylori directly. specifically, arginase activity of h. pylori strain j <dig> is low, but when the rocf gene from this strain was used to complement a rocf mutant of strain  <dig> in single copy on the chromosome, a surprisingly elevated arginase phenotype was observed, suggesting that strain  <dig> has an activator protein absent in strain j <dig> or strain j <dig> has a repressor protein absent from strain  <dig>  a possible molecular basis for this potential variation may be due to the hypervariablity in the upstream region, which displays variation in the shine-dalgarno  region, as well as variation in the region shown by dnase footprinting experiments to be bound by the arsr regulator  <cit> . mutations in the upstream region could either affect transcriptional expression, or translational control through changes in strength of the sd sequence. evidence in the literature also supports the rocf gene being regulated at the transcriptional level by acid  <cit>  and by the two-component system arss/r   <cit> . strain-specific transcriptional and translation regulation mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.

besides the hypothesized strain-specific arginase transcriptional and translation regulation, evidence was obtained that variations in the rocf sequence themselves play a key role in arginase activity, using the genetically stable e. coli model. e. coli is arginase negative, but when the h. pylori arginase genes were cloned into e. coli, variable arginase activity occurs. since enzyme activity varied dramatically with the particular arginase gene cloned into e. coli, variations in the rocf sequence would also be responsible for at least some of the arginase phenotypic variation. h. pylori strain-specific regulators that could affect arginase transcription in native h. pylori strains most likely would be absent in the e. coli model. pairwise alignments of rocf nucleotide sequences revealed significant microheterogeneity in the 3' end of the coding regions, and translation of these regions showed that rocf varies in the carboxy terminus. variations near the c-terminus could possibly affect the folding of the arginase active site, thereby accounting for some of the arginase activity variation.

evidence for the direct involvement of the rocf coding region in arginase activity variation was obtained from site-directed mutagenesis results. specifically, mutation of serine  <dig> to isoleucine in rocf from strain  <dig> completely abolished arginase activity, helping to explain why h. pylori strain a <dig>  which has isoleucine in position  <dig> in its native arginase, showed barely detectable arginase activity. thus, amino acid  <dig> appears to play a crucial role in arginase activity. notably, the rocf gene from strain a <dig> conferred the lowest arginase activity to e. coli among the  <dig> rocf genes examined . the possibility that other amino acid residues, or nucleotides in the rocf upstream region also play a role in the arginase null phenotype of strain a <dig> cannot be ruled out. future experiments will endeavor to elucidate the mechanism of why serine  <dig> is so critical for arginase activity, as there is no prior precedent for a serine being required for arginase activity.

evidence was also obtained that arginase activity could vary upon in vitro passage of some strains; the mechanism of this variation remains undefined. that the phylogenetic trees of the arginase promoter and the arginase protein bore little resemblance to each other suggested that each region is evolving via independent selective pressures. the greater nucleotide variability among arginase upstream regions compared with the coding regions suggests that the former has a higher mutation rate and more tolerance to nucleotide changes during selection of those mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
it was established that arginase varies genotypically and phenotypically among minimally-passaged clinical h. pylori isolates. future work could center on understanding in greater detail the molecular basis of arginase activity variation, and identifying strain-specific arginase regulators. this would lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms by which h. pylori genes undergo changes leading to microheterogeneity as the organism strives to survive in its seemingly inhospitable gastric niche.
