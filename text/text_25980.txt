BACKGROUND
the formation of neural circuits during development depends on a precise series of molecular and cellular events. once neurons have migrated to their final destination, they elaborate axons and dendrites along predetermined routes in the developing embryo to establish highly specific connections with their targets. semaphorins, a large family of secreted and membrane-associated proteins, are instrumental in establishing patterns of neuronal connectivity and influence many different aspects of neuronal network formation including axonal and dendritic growth, branching, guidance and pruning, target recognition, and synapse formation  <cit> . significant progress has been made in understanding how semaphorins provide guidance for extending neurites. their contribution to other aspects of neuronal network formation is, however, less well understood. for example, in addition to their chemotropic effects, semaphorins can exert neurite growth promoting effects  <cit> . for example, both in vitro and in vivo semaphorin7a  functions as an axon growth-promoting factor  <cit> . sema7a is the only glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored semaphorin described to date, and it was first identified as a member of the semaphorin family in a search for vertebrate orthologues of class  <dig> viral semaphorins  <cit> . in addition to promoting neurite outgrowth, sema7a expression and function studies support it playing a role in immune system function and bone morphogenesis. in the immune system, sema7a is expressed in the lymphoid and myeloid lineages and is known to affect several immunological functions including immune cell proliferation, chemotaxis and cytokine release  <cit> . furthermore, sema7a defines the john-milton-hagen human blood group on erythrocytes, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of a clinically benign autoimmune disorder  <cit> . a role for sema7a in bone formation is supported by the observation that sema7a can regulate osteoclast differentiation and pre-osteoblastic cell migration in vitro  <cit> . in line with this observation, polymorphisms in the human sema7a gene were recently found to be associated with bone mineral density and fracture risk in postmenopausal women  <cit> .

studies of sema7a expression and function in chick and mouse embryos define multiple, distinct, roles for sema7a in the developing nervous system. sema7a expression during early chick embryonic development hints at its involvement in neural crest cell migration and/or differentiation  <cit> . at later developmental stages, when neuronal connections are being established and remodelled, sema7a promotes growth and branching of certain neurite subsets  <cit> . for example, sema7a enhances the neurite outgrowth of cultured cortical, olfactory and sensory, but not vomeronasal, neurons. in support of these observations, sema7a-/- mice show marked defects in the growth of olfactory bulb axons projecting through the lateral olfactory tract during development  <cit> .

members of the plexin family are the major semaphorin receptors in the nervous system and sema7a has been shown to bind to one of the nine vertebrate plexins, plexinc <dig>  in vitro  <cit> . surprisingly, the axon growth promoting effects of sema7a do not require plexinc <dig> but instead depend on Î²1-integrins and associated signalling cascades  <cit> . however, the ability of sema7a to bind plexinc <dig>  the implication of sema7a-plexinc <dig> signaling in immune system function, and the expression of the genes encoding both proteins at times when select neuronal connections are established  <cit> , suggests that sema7a-plexinc <dig> interactions participate in neuronal network formation. unfortunately, the distribution of sema7a and plexinc <dig> during late embryonic and postnatal neural development, when important events in neuronal network formation and remodelling occur, is not well characterized. as a step toward obtaining a better understanding of the separate and cooperative functions of sema7a and plexinc <dig> during neural development, we have determined the spatiotemporal expression patterns of sema7a and plexinc <dig> in the developing and adult rat nervous system.

RESULTS
sema7a and plexinc <dig> are differentially expressed during neural development
in order to gain further insight into how sema7a and plexinc <dig> function in the developing nervous system, we assessed in detail the spatiotemporal patterns of sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression during rat neural development. first, we examined overall expression of sema7a and plexinc <dig> in the embryonic and adult brain by using northern blot and reverse transcription -pcr analyses. northern analysis of whole-brain mrna isolated from embryonic day  <dig> or adult rats revealed a single sema7a transcript of approximately  <dig>  kilobase pairs  and a single plexinc <dig> transcript of ~ <dig>  kb. these sizes are consistent with those reported previously  <cit> . the sema7a northern rna band was stronger in the adult brain compared to e <dig>  in contrast, plexinc <dig> expression is somewhat stronger in embryonic neural tissue . to analyze these differential temporal expression profiles in more detail, we performed rt-pcr using sema7a- and plexinc1-specific primers. consistent with our northern results, we found sema7a weakly expressed at e <dig> and its expression markedly increased towards adulthood. conversely, plexinc <dig> signals were strongest during late embryonic and early postnatal development, decreasing towards adulthood . overall, these results reveal striking complementary temporal expression profiles for sema7a and plexinc <dig> during rat neural development.

to further determine the spatial and temporal distributions of sema7a and plexinc <dig>  we performed in situ hybridization analyses on tissue sections of the embryonic, postnatal and mature rat nervous system. staining was absent from control sections, which were processed with sense probes . in support of our northern and rt-pcr data , in situ hybridization revealed that sema7a levels increase towards adulthood, whereas plexinc <dig> signals generally decline. for our expression studies, we largely focused on the olfactory system, hypothalamus and pituitary, hippocampus, meso-diencephalic dopamine  system, and spinal cord, all of which display distinguishing features of sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression.

plexinc <dig> and sema7a expression in the hypothalamo-hypophysial system
in the e <dig> and e <dig> eye, sema7a and plexinc <dig> are expressed in the retinal ganglion cell  layer . sema7a and plexinc <dig> are also detected in the inner plexiform layer  at e <dig> . in addition, sema7a and plexinc <dig> are expressed in the lens and the lens epithelium . analysis of the nasal region, revealed a population of plexinc1-expressing cells in close proximity to axon fascicles emerging from the vomeronasal organ  . these cells are organized in larger clusters or cords, reminiscent of migrating luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone  neurons  <cit> . in rodents, lhrh neurons originate in the olfactory placode, migrate across the nasal septum along vomeronasal nerve branches and enter the forebrain arching into the septal-preoptic area and hypothalamus  <cit> . indeed, in situ hybridization for plexinc <dig> and immunohistochemistry for lhrh on consecutive sections confirmed that plexinc1-positive neurons in the nasal compartment express lhrh . in contrast, sema7a transcript was not found in migrating lhrh neurons . plexinc1-positive lhrh cells are also present within the vne. in addition, both sema7a and plexinc <dig> are expressed in vomeronasal cells throughout the apical and basal vne . as neural development progresses, the number of lhrh neurons in the nasal compartment decreases as a result of their migration into the forebrain  <cit> .

this is consistent with our observation that the number of plexinc1-positive neurons along vomeronasal nerve branches in the nasal region and in the vne decreases as development progresses . at p <dig>  only a few plexinc1-positive lhrh neurons were detected in the vne . unfortunately, widespread plexinc <dig> expression in the forebrain prevented us from monitoring the intracerebral migration of the plexinc1-positive lhrh neurons . however, at later developmental stages plexinc1-expressing neurons are found in areas known to harbour lhrh neuron cell bodies, such as the medial preoptic area . overall, these results suggest a novel role for plexinc <dig> in neuronal cell migration.

once lhrh neurons reach their final destination in the cns they project axons to the median eminence , where lhrh is deposited into the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal system to stimulate lh release from the anterior pituitary  <cit> . during development, the me strongly expresses plexinc <dig> and to a lesser extent sema7a . in addition to the me, other portions of the developing hypothalamic area, including the supraoptic nucleus , display prominent sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression . as hypothalamic development progresses, plexinc <dig> expression becomes largely confined to the paraventricular nucleus , whereas sema7a transcripts remain widely distributed throughout the hypothalamus . in contrast to lhrh axons, which terminate at the me, fibers of magnocellular pvn and son neurons pass through the me to innervate the neural lobe of the pituitary  <cit> . similar to lhrh projections to the median eminence, both developing pvn and son projection neurons along with their target structure, the neural lobe of the pituitary, display strong plexinc <dig> expression during development .

these observations are in line with a recent study showing that plexinc <dig> is expressed in magnocellular pvn and son neurons at e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> .

the pituitary consists of three lobes; the neural lobe, the intermediate lobe, and the anterior lobe. the neural lobe derives from diencephalic tissue and the anterior and intermediate lobes form from an invagination of the oral ectoderm called rathke's pouch  <cit> . during pituitary development, expression of sema7a is most pronounced in rathke's pouch, and at later developmental stages in the intermediate and anterior lobes . in contrast, plexinc <dig> is largely confined to the neural part of the pituitary, with only weak expression observed in the intermediate lobe at late embryonic, but not postnatal or adult, stages . overall, these sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression patterns are consistent with sema7a and plexinc <dig> playing prominent roles in neuronal migration and network formation in the hypothalamo-hypophysial system.

sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression in the olfactory system
in addition to the vne , expression of sema7a and plexinc <dig> was observed in other portions of the primary and accessory olfactory systems. in the olfactory epithelium , sema7a was detected as early as e <dig>  the earliest timepoint examined in this study, and expression levels dramatically increased towards adulthood. in postnatal and adult rats, cells in both the basal and apical parts of the epithelium displayed sema7a signals . in contrast to sema7a, expression of plexinc <dig> in the oe was weak at each developmental stage examined . one exception is a small population of cells in the most basal part of postnatal and adult oe that expresses plexinc <dig> at moderate-to-high levels. interestingly, we detected only few of these plexinc1-positive cell patches scattered throughout non-septal oe . the target structure of oe neurons, the olfactory bulb , also expresses sema7a and plexinc <dig>  both gene products were detected in several distinct populations of ob neurons including mitral cells, tufted cells, granule cells, and periglomerular cells. however, whereas sema7a was detected in the majority of ob neurons, plexinc <dig> was only present in a subset of mitral, tufted, granule and periglomerular cells from e <dig> to adult . interestingly, plexinc <dig> transcripts were also found in different layers of the accessory olfactory bulb  and in cells in the rostral migratory stream  and subventricular zone . weak sema7a expression was observed in the aob but not in the rms . furthermore, sema7a and plexinc <dig> are present in the central nuclei in the brain that complete the primary and accessory olfactory pathways, including the piriform cortex and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract .

hippocampal ca <dig> neurons express high levels of sema7a
at e <dig>  both sema7a and plexinc <dig> were detected in the ca <dig> region of the developing hippocampus, but only sema7a was expressed in the dentate gyrus , albeit at lower levels . as development progresses, both sema7a and plexinc <dig> are found in the ca1-ca <dig> regions and in dentate granule and some hilar cells . in the adult, sema7a and plexinc <dig> are expressed in all hippocampal fields . although overall adult hippocampal expression of plexinc <dig> is somewhat lower than that at p <dig>  the hippocampus is one of the few neural structures that display moderate-to-strong adult plexinc <dig> expression. interestingly, sema7a expression in pyramidal neurons of the ca <dig> field is markedly higher than in adjacent ca <dig> and ca <dig> neurons . the ca <dig> is a narrow field of large-sized pyramidal cells located distal to the end bulbs of the dg mossy fiber projection. relatively little is known about the connections and function of neurons in the ca <dig> field. however, ca <dig> neurons have been reported to give rise to divergent intrahippocampal projections and to receive a particularly prominent input from several subdivisions of the mammillary nucleus, such as the supramammillary nucleus  <cit> . interestingly, during both embryonic and postnatal development the supramammillary nucleus and also other parts of the mammillary body display prominent sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression .

sema7a and plexinc <dig> define subsets of meso-diencephalic dopamine neurons
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta  and the ventral tegmental area   neurons) play a fundamental role in movement coordination and several select behaviours, respectively. within the snc and vta, mdda neurons are organized in specific neuronal subsets each with unique molecular and functional properties  <cit> . around e <dig>  mdda neurons, identified by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase , display moderate-to-strong plexinc <dig> expression. in contrast, no specific expression of sema7a could be detected at this stage . as development progresses, sema7a signals in the mdda system increase and expression of plexinc <dig> gradually decreases. in the adult, sema7a and plexinc <dig> are found in non-overlapping subsets of mdda neurons. comparison of the sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression patterns to that of th reveal that a small number of mdda neurons expressing sema7a is located in the snc, whereas plexinc1-positive mdda neurons are predominantly found in the central part of the vta . double labelling, combining in situ hybridization for sema7a or plexinc <dig> and immunohistochemistry for th, reveals a small subset of neurons in the snc and vta that express th and either sema7a or plexinc <dig>  in addition to these double-labelled neurons, cells expressing only sema7a, plexinc <dig> or th were detected. thus, in addition to sema7a or plexinc1-positive mdda neurons, the snc and vta contain mdda neurons that lack these transcripts and also non-mdda neurons or cells that express sema7a or plexinc <dig> .

in addition to mdda neurons themselves, the projection areas of these neurons also express sema7a and plexinc <dig>  snc neurons predominantly innervate the dorsal striatum and caudate-putamen , and vta neurons innervate the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex . during embryonic development, expression of both sema7a and plexinc <dig> was detected in the cortical plate throughout the developing cortex , whereas sema7a was also expressed in the subplate region . during postnatal development and in the adult, both sema7a and plexinc <dig> transcripts were broadly distributed in cortical layers ii to vi . interestingly, cortical expression of sema7a in the adult was most prominent in the barrel cortex . elevated expression of sema7a in the somatosensory cortex was only detected in the adult . sema7a and plexinc <dig> are also expressed in the developing striatum. a mediolateral gradient of sema7a expression was observed in the developing and mature striatum, whereas striatal plexinc <dig> expression was moderate-to-weak at embryonic stages and undetectable in the adult . overall, these results show that sema7a and plexinc <dig> not only define specific subsets of mdda neurons, but also label their target structures.

differential expression of sema7a and plexinc <dig> in the spinal cord, drg and in muscle
we also analyzed sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression in the spinal cord, starting at e <dig>  sema7a and plexinc <dig> were detected in dorsal root ganglion  neurons and throughout the spinal cord, with highest expression in motor neurons . in addition, plexinc <dig>  but not sema7a, is expressed in the floorplate, as observed previously  <cit> . similar expression patterns were observed at e <dig> . at p <dig> and in the adult, sema7a and plexinc <dig> are expressed in motor neurons and throughout the grey matter of the spinal cord . in addition, sema7a and plexinc <dig> were detected in non-neuronal cells in the postnatal and adult spinal cord. sema7a is expressed by oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord white matter, as revealed by their characteristic organization in strings of small-sized cells . plexinc <dig> is expressed in ependymal cells lining the central canal . in the adult drg, both small- and large-diameter sensory neurons express sema7a. plexinc <dig> expression is most prominent in, but not restricted to, small-diameter drg neurons . the gastrocnemic muscle is innervated by motor neurons located in the lumbar spinal cord. interestingly, sema7a is expressed in clusters of cells at the surface of individual muscle fibers, some of which closely resemble terminal schwann cells . overall, these results show that sema7a and plexinc <dig> label subsets of neuronal cells in spinal cord, drg and muscle.

discussion
the gpi-linked semaphorin sema7a was originally identified as a vertebrate homologue of a viral semaphorin  <cit> . besides regulating aspects of immune system function and bone morphogenesis, sema7a is a potent growth-stimulating factor for embryonic axons and postnatal dendrites  <cit> . plexins are the predominant semaphorin receptors and, not surprisingly, sema7a binds one of the nine vertebrate plexins, plexinc <dig>  <cit> . however, the axon growth-promoting effects of sema7a do not rely on plexinc <dig> but instead require Î²1-integrins  <cit> . this is intriguing since plexinc <dig> and sema7a transcripts are concomitantly expressed at the time neuronal connections are established and remodelled  <cit> . to better comprehend the neuronal function of sema7a and plexinc <dig> and to assess a potential role for neuronal sema7a-plexinc <dig> signalling, we performed a detailed comparative analysis of sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression patterns. the gene expression patterns reported here are consistent with both separate and cooperative sema7a and plexinc <dig> functions.

plexinc <dig> is expressed in migrating neurons
in addition to their role as axonal repellents and attractants, semaphorins can also guide migrating cells through repulsive or attractive mechanisms. for example, secreted class  <dig> semaphorins  influence the migration of gabaergic interneurons from the medial ganglionic eminence and restrict the migration of trunk neural crest cells to the anterior sclerotome  <cit> . similarly, class  <dig> transmembrane semaphorins  influence granule cell migration in the cerebellum and regulate the migration of endothelial and myocardial cells in the developing chick heart  <cit> . in many instances, these effects on migration require plexins. for example, plexina <dig> mediates sema6d-dependent migration events during cardiac morphogenesis and sema3e-mediated somatic vascular patterning is dependent on plexind <dig>  <cit> . in line with these observations, we find prominent plexinc <dig> expression in several classes of migratory neurons, including lhrh neurons in the nasal region, cells in the svz and rms, and cells in the rhombic lip and external granule cell layer  . these results suggest a novel role for plexinc <dig> in neuronal cell migration.

in the adult, lhrh regulates the release of anterior pituitary gonadotropes and is essential for reproduction. lhrh neurons originate from the embryonic nasal placode and migrate to the hypothalamus along olfactory/vomeronasal nerves. several factors influence lhrh neuron migration, either directly or indirectly via the extension and guidance of vomeronasal axons, including growth factors ) and axon guidance molecules   <cit> . the plexinc <dig> expression patterns we report here are consistent with both direct and indirect effects on lhrh neuron migration. plexinc <dig> could affect migrating lhrh neurons directly by mediating their selective adhesion to vomeronasal fibers or by influencing their subsequent migration. this would require lhrh cell-surface plexinc <dig> to bind membrane-associated proteins on vomeronasal axons. interestingly, the only mammalian plexinc <dig> ligand identified to date, sema7a, is expressed in embryonic and postnatal vomeronasal neurons. alternatively, plexinc <dig> could act in a homophilic manner. this idea is supported by the ability of plexins to engage in homophilic interactions  <cit>  and by the expression of plexinc <dig> in migrating lhrh neurons and vomeronasal neurons. a direct effect of plexinc <dig> on migrating neurons is further supported by recent work showing that plexinc <dig> is required for the proper allocation of developing magnocellular neurons to the pvn and son, presumably by interacting with a repulsive ligand in the anterior hypothalamus  <cit> . instead of affecting the migration of lhrh neurons directly, however, plexinc <dig> may influence vomeronasal/olfactory projections. the genetic ablation of guidance receptors such as dcc and neuropilin- <dig> results in severe defects in vomeronasal connectivity and as a result in misrouting of migrating lhrh neurons  <cit> . however, further work is needed to assess whether plexinc <dig>  by analogy with other plexins, acts as a bona fide guidance or growth receptor. the finding that sema7a does not affect vomeronasal axon growth and guidance in vitro  <cit>  argues against a role for this potential plexinc <dig> ligand in the formation of vomeronasal nerve branches.

in addition to lhrh neurons, plexinc <dig> is expressed in svz/rms cells and in the egl of the developing cerebellum. the migration of neuroblasts in the rms, and their subsequent differentiation into olfactory bulb granule and periglomerular cells is controlled by a complex molecular program which includes multiple growth and guidance molecules  <cit> . on basis of their expression in and around the svz, rms, and throughout the olfactory system, semaphorins and their receptors likely contribute to the molecular control of rms neuroblast migration and/or differentiation. the robust expression of sema7a in the ob and in tissues surrounding the rms is especially intriguing because of the expression of two distinct sema7a receptors in cells in the rms: plexinc <dig> and Î² <dig> integrins  <cit> . Î² <dig> integrins are required for rms cell chain formation and for the maintenance of glial tubes within the rms. although these morphological effects have been ascribed to distinct laminin isoforms, sema7a shares at least one integrin receptor with laminins  <cit> . while the function of plexinc <dig> in the rms remains to be addressed, cerebellar granule cells comprise another population of migrating neurons that expresses both plexinc <dig> and Î² <dig> integrins. following their generation in the rhombic lip, cerebellar granule cell precursors migrate tangentially over the cerebellar plate to form the egl. this initial migration is followed by a series of profound morphological changes and subsequent inward migration of postmitotic granule cells into the internal granular layer  <cit> . inactivation of Î² <dig> integrins results in cerebellar granule cell precursor proliferation defects and in the disruption of cerebellar folia. these defects have been attributed to perturbed interactions between a sonic hedgehog-laminin protein complex and Î±6Î² <dig> or Î±7Î² <dig> integrins  <cit> . in immune cells Î±1Î² <dig>  but not Î±6Î² <dig>  mediates sema7a function in monocyte activation, however, the role of Î±7Î² <dig> has not been addressed  <cit> . instead of binding to Î² <dig> integrins on gcps, however, sema7a may bind plexinc <dig>  which is enriched in cells in the rhombic lip and egl. in addition to sema7a, several other semaphorins are expressed in the developing cerebellum  <cit> . it is becoming clear that individual plexins can interact with members of different semaphorin classes. for example, plexind <dig> can bind sema3e and sema4a, while plexinas bind sema6s and sema3s, the latter via neuropilins  <cit> . therefore, reassessing the semaphorin binding partners of plexinc <dig> may help to further define the role of this protein in neuronal cell migration and also in other biological processes.

sema7a and plexinc <dig> are expressed in specific subsets of neurons and glial cells
neurons have often been grouped on basis of neurotransmitter expression or anatomical location. it is becoming increasingly clear, however, that within these chemically or anatomically defined neural systems distinct neuronal subsets exist, each displaying unique molecular and functional characteristics. for example, only a small subset of dopaminergic neurons in the snc were recently found to express the netrin- <dig> receptor dcc and to specifically innervate the most dorsal aspect of the snc projection area, the striatum  <cit> . as we report here, sema7a and plexinc <dig> label subsets of neurons in several different systems including the olfactory system, cortex, hippocampus, mdda system and neuromuscular system.

in the postnatal and adult hippocampus, sema7a transcripts are enriched in the ca <dig> subfield. ca <dig> pyramidal neurons give rise to divergent intrahippocampal projections while receiving a prominent input from the mammillary nucleus  <cit> . sema7a, plexinc <dig> and Î±1Î² <dig> integrins are expressed in the hippocampus and mammillary nucleus  <cit>  suggesting that sema7a signalling may influence the formation and maintenance of ca <dig> afferent and efferent projections. another hallmark of ca <dig> pyramidal neurons is their relative resistance to cell death during temporal lobe epilepsy  <cit> . the observation that sema7a acts as a survival factor for embryonic chick drg neurons in vitro , together with its prominent expression in ca <dig> pyramidal neurons and epilepsy-induced expression of Î±1Î² <dig> integrins in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes  <cit> , suggests that sema7a might protect ca <dig> neurons against epileptic damage.

in the mdda system sema7a labels a subpopulation of snc neurons, whereas plexinc <dig> is expressed by mdda neurons in the central vta. this observation is in line with a comparative analysis of gene expression profiles between the sn and vta, reporting highest levels of sema7a in mdda neurons of the sn and of plexinc <dig> in the vta  <cit> . based on the expression of sema7a and plexinc <dig> in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, it is tempting to speculate that these molecules contribute to the formation and maintenance of efferent and afferent dopaminergic midbrain connections.

is plexinc <dig> a sema7a receptor?
many semaphorin-mediated biological effects rely on receptor complexes that contain plexins as obligatory binding and/or signal transducing subunits. sema7a binds plexinc <dig>  <cit> , but thus far no functional role has been attributed to this interaction in neurons. instead, the specific sema7a functions in the neural and immune systems described to date require Î² <dig> integrins and not plexinc <dig>  <cit> . however, the ability of sema7a and plexinc <dig> to physically interact with high affinity, together with their neuronal expression profiles, supports the notion that cooperative interactions between these proteins play some role during neural development. these expression data presented here show that plexinc <dig> frequently labels projection neurons, e.g. mdda neurons in the vta or sensory neurons in the oe, while the putative plexinc <dig> ligand sema7a is present in their target structures, i.e. the prefrontal cortex and ob, respectively. while these observations are consistent with cooperative ligand-receptor interactions, it is evident that sema7a and plexinc <dig> also function independently. for example, sema7a is widely expressed in the adult nervous system, but plexinc <dig> expression is limited to only a few adult neural structures. in contrast, plexinc <dig> is expressed at high levels during early neural development, but mid-embryonic sema7a expression is relatively weak. overall, these observations indicate that additional interaction partners likely exist for sema7a and plexinc <dig>  interestingly, Î± <dig> and Î² <dig> integrin subunits are expressed in the adult nervous system  <cit> , while numerous other semaphorins, most of which have not yet been evaluated for plexinc <dig> binding, are present in the early embryonic nervous system . furthermore, and in striking contrast to sema7a, both plexinc <dig> and the Î² <dig> integrin subunit show a highly specific and spatially restricted expression patterns in the adult nervous system. this suggests that other sema7a receptors may exist in addition to plexinc <dig> and Î² <dig> integrins.

CONCLUSIONS
the sema7a and plexinc <dig> expression patterns reported in this study are consistent with both cooperative and separate functions for the proteins encoded by these genes during neural development. cooperative effects are supported by complementary expression patterns in various neuronal systems. separate functions are strongly suggested at early and late stages of development, when either plexinc <dig> or sema7a is prominently expressed. this suggests there are additional binding partners for plexinc <dig> and sema7a. for plexinc <dig> these may include semaphorins belonging to other subclasses, and sema7a already has been shown to signal through Î±1Î² <dig> integrins. the expression of plexinc <dig> in several groups of migratory neurons suggests a novel role for this plexin family member in cell migration. future work will address these and other plexinc <dig> and sema7a biological functions.
