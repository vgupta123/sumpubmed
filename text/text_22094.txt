BACKGROUND
in many species the main limitation to understanding and characterising important traits is the lack of sufficient genetic markers for the development of high-density genetic maps and association studies. large numbers of markers, such as simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms , are required to assist in identifying genes that underlie genetic variation. for many crop and horticultural species, genetic linkage maps have now been developed and quantitative trait loci  have been assigned to large chromosomal regions, but so far candidate genes have been identified for only a few of these  <cit> . the need for more genetic markers is recognised and until recently has been a major challenge and expense. with the introduction of new sequencing technologies, traditional low-throughput methods of marker development have been superseded  <cit> . these technologies are often referred to as 'second generation sequencing'  and the platforms include the illumina genome analyzer, the roche  <dig> flx and the applied biosystems solid systems, all of which are widely used for shotgun genome sequencing and snp discovery  <cit> .

deep-level 2gs technologies are now being applied to non-model species as a viable and favourable alternative to sanger sequencing, despite the absence of a reference genomic sequence on which to map the short reads. expressed sequence tags , derived from the rna-based transcriptome, have been extremely useful resources to assist marker development  <cit>  and, by utilising 2gs technologies, transcripts can be sequenced to a greater depth, enabling discovery of novel gene sequences at a fraction of the cost and time taken previously. this approach is particularly useful in species where there is little genome information, allowing a large number of snps to be identified from across a wide range of transcripts  <cit> . recently, several such studies based on high-throughput transcriptome sequencing have been carried out in non-model plant species, including maize, grapevine, eucalyptus, olive and common bean  <cit> .

blackcurrant  is taxonomically isolated within the saxifragaceae and current genomics resources are extremely limited. as with many economically important woody perennial species, breeding of ribes is a long-term process due to the highly heterozygous germplasm available and the long generation time, so there is an obvious incentive to develop marker-assisted breeding strategies to reduce the timescale for selection of superior genotypes. previously, we have constructed cdna libraries from developing fruit and buds, and sanger-sequenced several thousand ests  <cit> . from these libraries, forty-three ssr and sixteen snp markers have been mapped genetically and, together with aflps, a number of markers associated with key phenological and fruit quality traits identified. despite these being relatively large sequencing efforts at the time, we were still only able to generate a sparsely populated framework map of  <dig> cm with qtl spanning  <dig> to  <dig> cm. 2gs technologies now offer the opportunity to generate large numbers of novel markers from which to construct high-density genetic linkage maps.

the aim of our current study was to perform large-scale snp discovery from gene coding regions of blackcurrant using 2gs  <dig> pyrosequencing. once snps were identified, an efficient means of genotyping was required. previous studies have validated only a small proportion of the identified snps, usually by sanger re-sequencing  <cit> . high-density assays for snp detection have recently been developed and one such platform from illumina enables simultaneous assays of  <dig> markers from a single dna sample. a subset of polymorphic snps from blackcurrant, representing a diverse set of genes, was therefore used to develop a  <dig> snp oligo pool all  assay on the illumina beadxpress platform. in addition, 2gs transcriptome sequencing facilitated identification of novel est-ssrs which are proven robust marker types  <cit> . to facilitate validation of these snps and ssrs, two segregating mapping populations and a diverse set of germplasm,  <dig> samples in total, were assayed.

RESULTS
the overall objective of this study was to determine whether 2gs technology would enable significant gene discovery in ribes nigrum and whether these short reads could be assembled de novo for efficient isolation and development of novel genetic markers. in this study, over  <dig>  sequence reads generated from cdna derived from developing blackcurrant buds of parental genotypes gave sufficient coverage to detect c.  <dig>  snps, a subset of which were validated via the illumina beadxpress genotyping platform.

transcriptome sequencing, contig assembly and gene annotation
a total of  <dig>  high-quality sequence reads derived from pooled rna extracted from developing buds of each of the ribes parents s <dig>  and s <dig>  were screened for adaptor sequence contamination, leaving  <dig>  reads  and  <dig>  reads , followed by removal of ribosomal matches, leaving  <dig>  reads  and  <dig>  reads . we found significantly higher levels of rrna-derived contamination in s <dig>  compared to s <dig> , which was believed to be due to processing-related factors, therefore a further run of s <dig> was necessary to boost filtered read levels from this parent. the mean read length of the final sets were  <dig> nt  and  <dig> nt  respectively. these were subsequently assembled de novo, resulting in  <dig>  contiguous sequences  and  <dig>  singletons, with a mean contig length of  <dig> nt . these contigs and singleton sequences were annotated with descriptors of their closest homologues by running blastx searches against the non-redundant protein sequences from ncbi and the peptide models for arabidopsis thaliana from tair  <cit> , matching  <dig>  and  <dig>  peptides respectively. the percentage of assembly products scoring significant blast hits  was 52% and 64% respectively, reflecting the high level of novel gene identification for ribes in this study. the blast hits resulting from the search against the arabidopsis peptides were also processed further by extracting gene ontology  terms for each hit using the go annotation provided by tair . there was representation of transcripts in all but one of the major go categories for biological processes, the exception being the "other physiological processes" category. in addition to annotating the assembled contigs, we also compared them with the set of existing sanger sequenced ests from the cultivar ben hope   <cit> , using the  <dig> contigs as query sequences in a blast search against the sanger ests. a total of  <dig>  of the existing sanger est contigs were represented in the output from the  <dig> runs, leaving  <dig>  without representation, reflecting the difference in tissue provenance between samples.

marker development: single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats
a set of  <dig>  high-confidence  ribes snps were discovered using gigabayes software. parental genotypes were also defined and for the majority of cases, either one parent  or both parents  were heterozygous, and only a small proportion  was found where both parents were homozygous. there were only  <dig> cases where all the reads in the contig originated from the same parent, and these were not considered for further use in this study. as well as snps, many of the est sequences contained repeat motifs. using sputnik software  <cit> ,  <dig>  ssrs were identified, of which over half were trinucleotide, a third dinucleotide, and a small number were tetra- and pentanucleotide repeats.

the  <dig> snp assay was designed using illumina technical support . as described in the methods section, the illumina snp selection was based on an absence of neighbouring polymorphisms, repetitive elements or palindromes, which are known to have an adverse effect on success of assays.

preliminary analysis of snps in the mapping populations
from the  <dig> snps scored,  <dig> were identified as segregating in mapping population scri  <dig> using the beadstudio software . of these,  <dig> were heterozygous in the seed parent only,  <dig> were heterozygous in the pollen parent only and  <dig> were heterozygous in both parents. inspection of segregation ratios of the individual markers showed four lines in the population with unexpected genotypes for many snps, and these were excluded from subsequent analysis. a cluster analysis of the remaining progeny based on the markers that were heterozygous for the seed parent only showed no particular groupings, but a cluster analysis based on the markers heterozygous for the pollen parent showed a distinct cluster of  <dig> offspring, none of which had inherited any of the alleles specific to the pollen parent. a chi-squared test was used to compare the segregation ratio of these  <dig> offspring with the remaining  <dig> offspring for the markers heterozygous for the seed parent. this found that the segregation ratios were significantly different  for  <dig> of the  <dig> markers, with a segregation ratio close to 1:2: <dig> for these  <dig> offspring, but 1: <dig> for the remaining offspring. these results are consistent with these  <dig> offspring being selfs and these were excluded from the linkage analysis.

in the mp <dig> population,  <dig> of the  <dig> snps were found to segregate using the beadstudio software. of these,  <dig> were heterozygous in cv. ben finlay  only,  <dig> were heterozygous in cv. hedda  only and  <dig> were heterozygous in both parents. a cluster analysis of the mp <dig> population showed three lines in the population with unexpected genotypes for many snps and these were excluded from subsequent analysis. cluster analysis showed no evidence for any selfing or other grouping of individuals within this population.

linkage analysis of scri 9328
both snp and ssr markers were used in the linkage analysis. no markers were isolated from this population: all were linked with a lod of at least  <dig> to one or more other markers. two linkage groups formed at a lod score of three, but the remaining markers only separated at a higher lod, between  <dig> and  <dig>  this gave ten linkage groups, of which two were small, while the remaining groups had 14- <dig> markers. the markers within each linkage group were ordered together, rather than separating the markers from the two parents as is sometimes necessary for this type of cross. the fit of the linkage map was, in the authors' experience, unusually good for an outbreeding species. only five markers were omitted as causing problems with the fit, and joinmap's mean chi-squared criterion for the resulting maps was below  <dig>  for each of the eight large linkage groups. figure  <dig> shows the linkage maps, produced using the mapchart  <dig>  software  <cit> . the linkage groups have the same numbering as in  <cit> , using the ssr markers for identification: the order of the ssr markers shows good agreement with the smaller population. the total map length is  <dig> cm.

linkage analysis of mp7
in this population, six snp markers were excluded as having highly distorted ratios . five markers were isolated at a lod of  <dig>  the remaining markers formed  <dig> linkage groups using a lod threshold between  <dig> and  <dig>  there were two small groups, of two and three markers, and seven larger ones of 8- <dig> markers. two markers were excluded as causing problems with the fit. the remaining fits were good, again with all mean chi-squared criteria below  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the linkage maps, with lines connecting markers to the corresponding ones on scri  <dig>  these show good agreement between the maps. the total map length is  <dig> cm.

analysis of heterogeneity between recombination frequencies
where there are pairs of snps in common between the corresponding linkage groups, the recombination frequencies can be tested for heterogeneity using a chi-squared test implemented in joinmap  <dig>  a total of  <dig> pairs of snps were examined. of these, there was no significant heterogeneity  for  <dig> pairs, while  <dig> pairs had significance between  <dig>  and  <dig> , i.e. a similar number to that expected by chance. six pairs showed more significant heterogeneity, two pairs on lg <dig> both involving cl113contig1_ <dig> were significant with p <  <dig> , while four pairs on lg <dig>  all involving cl754contig1_ <dig>  were significant with p <  <dig> . heterogeneity of recombination frequencies is therefore not a widespread problem between these two crosses.

qtl analysis of the snp theta scores for the scri  <dig> population
inspection of the  <dig> snp theta scores for the scri  <dig> population showed that  <dig> snps had more than  <dig> missing values. these were excluded from further analysis, leaving  <dig> snps with at most  <dig> missing values. the range was also examined: the ideal snp will have a range of one, i.e. a theta score of one for the bb genotype and zero for the aa genotype. snps with a range less than  <dig>  were excluded from the qtl analysis, leaving a total of  <dig> snps for which the theta scores were mapped. these consisted of  <dig> snps that were mapped as clear bi-allelic markers, five snps that segregated as bi-allelic markers but were excluded from the linkage map and  <dig> snps that were considered as non-segregating by beadstudio.

all  <dig> snps that could be mapped as markers mapped to the same location when their theta scores were used for qtl mapping. regression of the theta values on the most significant marker explained 71-99% of the variance in the theta values, with a lower quartile of 97%. the five snp markers that were dropped from the linkage analysis due to their poor fits to the linkage group all mapped to the same groups when the theta scores were analysed as qtl, with regression on the closest marker explaining 90-99% of the variance of the theta score. two of these markers were heterozygous in both parents, and mapped to a region on lg <dig> with some segregation distortion. the other three were heterozygous in one parent but, when mapped as qtl, showed associations to the alleles from the other parent.

the  <dig> remaining snps, when mapped as qtl, showed marker associations with the maximum percentage variance explained ranging from  <dig> %  to 99%. thirty-one of the snps had a maximum percentage variance of at least 70%, comparable to the snps that were also mapped as markers. significance thresholds for the presence of qtl were established by means of a permutation test  <cit> , using  <dig> permutations for each of three traits with different ranges, indicating that the maximum percentage variance explained for any of these permuted traits was  <dig> %. thirty-six snps had a maximum percentage variance below  <dig> % and these will be categorised as without significant qtl. however we are interested here in snps where there is substantial, rather than just statistically significant, genetic variance and we have therefore chosen to focus on snps where the maximum percentage variance explained by marker regression is greater than 50%. fifty-two of the  <dig> snps fall in this range. one-lod confidence intervals for these snps, together with the five that were a poor fit in the linkage analysis, are shown in figure  <dig> 

qtl analysis of the snp theta scores for the mp <dig> population
in this population,  <dig> snps had theta scores with a range greater than or equal to  <dig>  and at most  <dig> missing values. one hundred and eighteen of these were scored as markers, with  <dig> placed on the linkage map. of the  <dig> remaining snps,  <dig> mapped as qtl with more than 50% of the variance explained and these are shown in figure  <dig>  there is good agreement between the positions of the snp markers in the two populations, whether mapped as markers or as qtl:  <dig> snps mapped as qtl to similar positions on the same chromosome in both populations,  <dig> snps mapped as a qtl in one population and as a marker to a similar position on the same chromosome. some only mapped in one population. only one clear discrepancy was found, cl2395contig1_ <dig>  this mapped as a marker in scri  <dig> to linkage group lg <dig>  as a qtl, it mapped to the same location with 82% of the trait variance explained, but showed smaller, though significant  peaks on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  cl2395contig1_ <dig> did not map as a marker in mp <dig> but mapped as a qtl to lg <dig>  with 71% of the trait variance explained.

validation of snps via diversity analysis
the  <dig> snps were also used to examine diversity in a range of  <dig> ribes nigrum cultivars and  <dig> related species. the number of polymorphic snps was similar to that observed in the original mapping population . diversity values for each snp, measured using nei's unbiased expected heterozygosity, ranged from  <dig>  to the maximum value of  <dig> , with an overall mean value of  <dig>  . the observed and expected heterozygosity values were similar, with a mean inbreeding coefficient of - <dig>  . only  <dig> loci exhibited a minimum allele frequency  less than  <dig>  and  <dig> with a maf less than  <dig> . almost half of those scored were shown to be monomorphic in the  <dig> related species.

validation of ssrs via mapping and diversity analysis
a subsample of  <dig> ssrs representing different motif types and repeat numbers were tested using the scri  <dig> mapping parents and a range of blackcurrant germplasm and related species, gooseberry  and redcurrant . of the  <dig> ssr primers designed,  <dig> amplified in all genotypes tested and of the  <dig> ssrs which were subsequently fluorescently labeled and visualised using the abi  <dig>   <dig> were mapped in the segregating population  and  <dig> were polymorphic in the germplasm collection. the number of alleles ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mean value of  <dig>  and a mean unbiased expected heterozygosity of  <dig>  . as with snp analysis, ssrs showed similar values for observed and expected heterozygosity and a comparable inbreeding coefficient of  <dig>  . comparing cultivated and wild accessions, diversity was greater in the wild ribes, although this was associated with high levels of inbreeding  for all loci, suggesting the presence of null alleles in the wild germplasm.

discussion
central to all plant breeding programmes is the identification of genes that control economically important traits. traditionally this has been achieved by developing genetic maps using a limited number of molecular markers. with the recent advances in sequencing technologies, markers can now be generated on an unprecedented scale  <cit> . we report the use of 2gs  <dig> technology to generate over  <dig>  reads from cdna of developing blackcurrant buds, allowing sufficient coverage to identify over  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  ssrs. below we discuss the attributes of the assembled contigs and singletons and the utility of the snp and ssr markers to provide an improved genetic map to help identify genes responsible for important traits in blackcurrant.

in terms of read numbers and assembled contigs and singletons, our results were similar to those generated in other  <dig> transcriptome studies of non-model species  <cit> . of  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons, 52% and 64% scored significant blast hits to peptide sequences in the public domain, which was higher than that reported for other tree species including eucalyptus grandis   <cit>  and pinus contorta   <cit> . however, these relatively low levels of significant homologies and the presence of ests not found in our sanger est collection  <cit>  reflect the high proportion of novel genes discovered in this study for blackcurrant. from the peptide homologies and go annotation analysis , it was clear that transcripts from a wide range of genes, with respect to putative function and localisation, have been sampled and thereby form the basis of novel gene-specific markers.

second generation sequencing has been used to identify snps in a range of plant species  <cit> . in this study we identified over  <dig>  snps from de novo assembled blackcurrant est data. as well as the development of this approach for snp discovery, we addressed the question of validation and whether de novo snp discovery based upon 2gs data alone can translate into snp detection assays and, more importantly, useful markers. we designed a multiplex high-throughput snp detection assay based on the illumina beadxpress platform and examined polymorphism across  <dig> snps using two segregating populations and a diverse set of germplasm. although all snps were chosen to be polymorphic from read alignments, we were unable to confirm almost half of putative snps from the current assembly by a linkage mapping approach as they did not segregate clearly in the mapping populations. there may be technical reasons why some snps do not perform as well as others: close et al.  <cit>  describe some unscorable snps due to low gentrain scores , even though they had been selected from sanger sequenced est collections. although several of our snps fall into this class , the majority of those unconfirmed snps appeared in a single cluster with high gentrain scores and were subsequently scored as monomorphic. these monomorphic snps could be sequencing errors masquerading as snps or mis-assembled reads, resulting in sequences of gene family members from different regions of the genome being assembled into single contigs. additional sequencing would be expected to increase the transcriptome space coverage which would ultimately improve the specificity of assembly. recently, we augmented our blackcurrant ests using paired-end illumina 2gs of the same rna  and found that several of the  <dig> contigs which led to monomorphic snps  were not supported in the new assembly and that many of the predicted snps  in these contigs also disappeared. this also highlights the recent rapid technical advances in 2gs, in terms of levels of coverage and sequencing fidelity achievable. indeed, hybrid assemblies derived from multiple 2gs platforms often achieve the most reliable contig datasets. alternative strategies to rna-seq include genomic reduction approaches, which aim to reduce gdna complexity of species with large genomes, such as maize, grain amaranths, common bean and soybean  <cit> . these approaches may suffer less from mis-assembly, by including unique non-coding sequences, however such non-genic markers cannot often be directly related to functionality. as well as reducing the initial complexity, improvements in de novo assembly and snp identification pipelines have recently been developed  <cit> .

using the available analysis software , we were able to map  <dig> snps  and  <dig> snps  from two blackcurrant mapping populations, scri  <dig> and mp <dig> respectively. although these levels appear relatively low, considering both parents of  <dig> were used in the snp discovery pipeline, other studies which have used mapping parents in the same manner  found similar numbers of snps placed on the genetic maps in maize   <cit>  and in two mapping populations of potato   <cit> . there was good agreement of markers between maps with very little heterogeneity of recombination frequencies. although these snps greatly improved our previous maps, we investigated the monomorphic markers further by mapping the theta score outputs from the beadstudio analysis as quantitative traits. as these scores are expected to be from a single genetic locus, plus some measurement error, we used a very high threshold of 50% of the trait variance explained by a single position. at this threshold we were able to place  <dig> of the visually monomorphic snps on the scri  <dig> map and  <dig> on the mp <dig> map. in general there was good agreement between positions in the two populations, whether snps were mapped as qtl in both populations or as a qtl in one population and a marker in the other. further snps could be mapped as qtl by lowering the threshold. we plan to investigate further how snp theta scores can best be used in such analyses.

the  <dig> snp assay was also used to genotype a set of diverse blackcurrant accessions, including breeding lines, and related cultivated and wild ribes species. over half of the snps were polymorphic with a mean maf of  <dig> , similar to that observed in chicken  and pigs  using snps from reduced representation libraries  <cit> . mammadov et al.  <cit>  used maf as a means of measuring polymorphism for snp markers, and in their maize study using  <dig> mapped snps, 80% had a maf >  <dig> . in our study of  <dig> polymorphic snps, over 75% had a maf >  <dig> . the snp markers also performed well when comparing diversity to other studies  and, as expected for blackcurrant, there was no evidence of inbreeding, with very similar values of observed and expected heterozygosity.

as well as snps, several studies have used similar approaches to mine for ssrs, for a range of applications including mapping, systematics, population and conservation genetics  <cit> . the numbers of identified ssrs varied across these studies from almost all  sequences with microsatellites   <cit>  to several hundred   <cit> , with most studies falling somewhere in between. in this study, we have identified over  <dig>  novel blackcurrant est-ssrs using  <dig> 2gs which will provide sufficient gene-based markers for most applications. diversity values from our study  were comparable with others   <cit> , although as expected these were slightly lower than in our previous study using genomic ssrs, with values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . however, the effort and time required to develop genomic ssrs is far greater and more costly. furthermore, we observed significant correlation between the genetic distances matrices generated from snp and ssr data for the same blackcurrant individuals , corroborating the robustness of these markers for a range of applications.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found the use of 2gs technologies for marker development far superior to any previously described methods , both in terms of the numbers of snps and ssrs identified and in the biological informativeness of those markers. the approach is extremely cost-effective for species with unsequenced genomes and would be greatly improved simply by utilising, or using combinations of, the most up-to-date 2gs technologies available. informatics analysis of such data is still in its infancy, but on-going improvements to assembly and identification will allow simple selection of the most robust and informative markers from any species into a working assay, thereby enhancing the development of marker-assisted breeding strategies. at the present time, such strategies for breeding in ribes are restricted to a single-gene pest resistance trait  <cit>  but, using the findings reported here, the opportunity to extend early selection to include complex traits such as fruit quality and developmental characters offers exciting prospects for future varietal development in blackcurrant.
