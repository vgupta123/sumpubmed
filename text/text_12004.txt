BACKGROUND
piroplasmosis in cattle is caused by tick-borne haemoprotozoan parasites comprising several theileria and babesia species  <cit> . these diseases are of serious health and economic concern in several parts of the world, including tropical and temperate countries. in spain the main malignant piroplasm species causing severe theileriosis signs is theileria annulata, with infections described in southern and mediterranean areas  <cit> , where the tick vector  is present  <cit> . however, the most widespread theileria is theileria buffeli, which is in general considered a benign species. regarding babesia spp., several pathogenic species have been reported in central and southern spain   <cit> , though only b. bigemina and b. bovis have been detected in these areas in recent epidemiological studies using molecular methods  <cit> . different weather conditions in different parts of spain determine tick vector distribution, and therefore, the incidence of piroplasmosis. unlike the dry and hot mediterranean climate of eastern and southern parts, northern spain covers two different climatic zones: an atlantic climate in the northern coast with frequent rainfall and mild temperatures, and a continental mediterranean climate in the interior central plateau with colder winters and warmer summers. hence, the main tick species infesting cattle in northern spain are ixodes ricinus, haemaphysalis punctata, dermacentor spp. and rhipicephalus bursa  <cit> . moving in a southerly direction, ticks of the genus hyalomma become more prevalent, and similarly, other tick species such as i. ricinus and dermacentor reticulatus become nearly absent  <cit> . therefore, a different situation regarding bovine piroplasms diversity would be expected in this northern area compared to other parts of spain. however, there are no studies on bovine piroplasmosis in northern spain using molecular identification techniques.

laboratorial diagnosis of clinical infection by piroplasms in cattle is usually based on the detection of the parasite in giemsa-stained blood smears. carrier animals, in which low numbers of erythrocytes remain infected, are important contributors to the transmission of the infection by tick bites. hence, detection of piroplasms in carrier animals is very important to control the infection. however, detection of piroplasms by microscopy is not easy and it is generally not possible to discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic species that may occur simultaneously within the same host. although serological tests can be used to detect circulating antibodies, cross-reactivity with antibodies directed against other species of piroplasms has been reported  <cit> . moreover, antibodies tend to disappear in long-term carriers, whereas piroplasms persist. therefore, animals with a negative serological test can still be the source of the infection and infect ticks. several pcr-based diagnosis procedures for the identification of these parasites have been developed  <cit> . however, increased sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by combining pcr with a specific hybridisation by means of reverse line blot , a macroarray that is also capable of identifying mixed infections  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and identity of piroplasm species infecting the bovine blood samples with suspicion of piroplasmosis submitted to the diagnostic service of our institute from northern spain in recent years using reverse line blot  macroarrays.

RESULTS
microscopy examination of blood samples identified intracellular forms morphologically compatible with piroplasms in  <dig> % of them ,  <dig> % corresponding to theileria spp. and  <dig> % to babesia spp. piroplasms were detected by microscopy in  <dig>  % of the animals with clinical signs compatible with piroplasmosis and in  <dig> % of those with unspecific signs. in samples with babesia infection red cell parameters  were significantly lower  than in those with theileria spp.  or negative . red cell parameters in samples with theileria spp. were lower than in negative samples but differences were not significant. samples with mixed infections  presented intermediate values  that were significantly lower than in negative samples in terms of pcv. leukocyte countings were also significantly lower  in animals with babesia than in negative  or theileria-infected animals  .

 <dig> of the blood samples analysed hybridised with at least one of the species-specific probes of the rlb array, finding positive signals with all six probes . thus, positive samples increased to  <dig> % when analysed by rlb , with piroplasms being detected in  <dig> % of the animals with suspicion of piroplasmosis and in  <dig> % of those with unspecific signs. t. buffeli was the most frequently found species being present in  <dig> % of the samples , mainly as a single infection  but also in mixed infections . the highly pathogenic species t. annulata was second in detection with  <dig> % of the samples positive , in  <dig> of them as a single infection  and as part of mixed infections in the remaining  <dig> samples . t. annulata was found in  <dig> farms distributed throughout spain, including the  <dig> farms from the endemic regions  that accounted for  <dig> animals with single infection. the remaining  <dig> farms positive to t. annulata were in northern spain and they appeared both as single and mixed infections. in six of these farms only  <dig> or  <dig> animals were analysed, being all of them positive to t. annulata . in the other three farms the number of animals sampled varied among  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , and other piroplasm species besides t. annulata were also found in all three farms.

presence of babesia species was less frequently detected, with  <dig> samples positive  either as single or mixed infection . the species most frequently found was b. major, present in  <dig> animals  from  <dig> farms. in five samples it was found as a single infection whereas in the remaining  <dig> it appeared combined with t. buffeli. b. bigemina was detected in  <dig> animals  from  <dig> farms and it always appeared as part of a mixed infection with one or both species of theileria. conversely, b. bovis was only found as a single infection present in  <dig> animals  from  <dig> farms from northern spain. finally, b. divergens was only found in  <dig> samples  from  <dig> farms, in one animal it occurred as a single infection while in the other two, b. divergens was detected along with t. buffeli.

there was no significant difference in the percentage of animals infected with t. annulata or t. buffelli between the group of animals with clinical suspicion of piroplasmosis and those with unspecific signs. however, detection of b. major and b. bovis was significantly associated to the group of animals with clinical suspicion of piroplasmosis .

mixed infections were detected in a total of  <dig> samples, accounting for six different combinations of species . one of them included three species and the remaining five were composed of a combination of two species. whereas t. buffeli and t. annulata were found together in  <dig> samples , no mixed infections with two babesia species were detected. t. buffeli, the most prevalent species, was found in combination with all the other species except with b. bovis, which was only found in single infections.

when compared with microscopy, rlb detected a positive signal in  <dig> % of the samples with negative microscopy , identifying t. buffeli in  <dig> % of them,t. annulata in  <dig> %, and several species of babesia in  <dig> %. however,  <dig> samples positive by microscopy were not detected by rlb analysis. when looking only to the rlb results of the animals with negative microscopy , the lowest red cell parameters were found in one animal infected with b. major  and the animals infected with b. bovis , whereas animals infected with species of theileria had lower values than negative animals but within the normal ranges.

although the number of samples submitted from each farm was in general quite small ,  <dig> pathogenic species  were found in  <dig> farms, located all of them in northern spain. t. annulata was present in all five, along with b. bigemina in four of them and with b. bovis in the fifth.

discussion
the technique used in this study allowed the simultaneous detection and identification of different bovine theileria and babesia species using oligonucleotide probes whose specificity has been previously determined  <cit> . moreover, the combination of a generic babesia and theileria pcr targeting the v <dig> region of the 18s rrna gene and a hybridisation with specific probes provided high sensitivity  <cit> . since detection of the parasite in giemsa-stained blood smears is the technique that has been traditionally used for diagnosis of piroplasmosis, whenever possible rlb and microscopy examination were performed in parallel. besides, positive microscopy allowed us to identify animals with parasitaemia. thus, rlb hybridisation detected piroplasms in  <dig> samples that were negative by microscopy examination reaching a total of  <dig> % of positive samples, while only  <dig> % could be detected by microscopy. in any case, and even though rlb was significantly more sensitive than microscopy, piroplasms were detected by microscopy in  <dig> samples negative by rlb. this discrepancy could be due to subjective interpretation of microscopy examination or bad conditions of the samples . whatever the reason, the inclusion of the catchall and genus-specific probes guarantees that this discrepancy cannot be ascribed to infection with new piroplasm species.

t. buffeli was the most prevalent species with  <dig> % of the samples positive by rlb. this value is much lower than that reported in eastern spain using the same technology  <cit> , but higher than in northeastern portugal  <cit> . t. buffeli was mainly found as a single infection, but it was also the most common species found in mixed infections. although stockham and cols.  <cit>  described a case of clinical disease associated to t. buffeli infection, this species is generally considered as non-pathogenic. the results obtained in this study would confirm this idea, since samples with organisms morphologically compatible with theileria spp. by microscopy examination and identified as t. buffeli by rlb presented red cell parameters within the normal ranges. however, this does not exclude the possibility that subclinical infections with t. buffeli might cause a production decrease. further research is therefore needed to establish the significance and effect on bovine production of this highly prevalent species. conversely, t. annulata is clearly recognised as a very pathogenic theileria that has been mainly described in temperate areas as the causative agent of mediterranean theileriosis. in spain most of the cases are generally restricted to southern and eastern parts of the country, where the tick vector  is endemic  <cit> . in this study t. annulata was found in  <dig> samples from  <dig> farms,  <dig> in the endemic regions and  <dig> in northern spain. the lower incidence of t. annulata compared to t. buffeli  is in agreement with the different geographic distribution of the tick vectors associated to each species. thus, whereas the vector of t. buffeli  is quite common in northern spain  <cit> , ticks of the genus hyalomma seem to be endemic of southern and eastern parts of the country and reports on its presence in northern spain are only sporadic  <cit> . in this sense, recent data  have revealed the recent emergence of hyalomma ticks in cattle in la rioja , suggesting that the distribution of mediterranean theileriosis might be changing, probably due to changes in climatic conditions and vegetation that affect vector distribution.

infection with babesia species accounted for  <dig> % of the samples corresponding to  <dig> % of b. major,  <dig> % of b. bigemina,  <dig> % of b. bovis and  <dig> % of b. divergens. however, this is the first time that b. major and b. divergens are detected in spain using molecular techniques. in previous reports species identification had been based on morphological examinations by microscopy. tick vectors associated to these species seem to be h. punctata and i. ricinus, respectively  <cit> , which are very abundant in northern spain  <cit> . b. bovis is regarded as the most pathogenic bovine babesia species and so far in spain it had only been reported in balearic islands   <cit> , although it had been identified before in southern and western spain by microscopy examination  <cit> . b. bovis is transmitted by ticks of three genera   <cit> , although only the first two are found in northern spain. in our study we found  <dig> positive samples from  <dig> farms in northern spain with a history of piroplasmosis. in two farms b. bovis was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> samples, and  <dig> out of  <dig>  respectively. in the third farm, samples had been submitted to the laboratory at four different time points  throughout  <dig> years with reports of unspecific clinical signs. in addition to b. bovis, t. annulata and t. buffeli were also detected in one animal each, suggesting that different piroplasms were circulating within that farm. however, in none of the  <dig> positive samples was b. bovis found in a mixed infection.

again, as in the case of single infections, t. buffeli was also the most prevalent species in mixed infections. it appeared in  <dig> of them , in combinations of two or even three, with all the other species except b. bovis. this was the only species never found in combination with other piroplasms in our study, although almeria et al.  <cit>  found it in a mixed infection with theileria sp. opposite to b. bovis, b. bigemina was only detected as a mixed infection with either t. buffeli or t. annulata or both. this same situation was also found by almeria et al.  <cit> . although the number of samples with mixed infections is relatively small, the association of certain piroplasm species and not others in mixed infections might be linked to the tick vectors present in the vegetation of a certain area.

the  <dig> samples with positive rlb hybridisation but negative microscopy, corresponded in most of the cases to infections with theileria species  and to lesser extent with babesia species . these samples  had haematology values within the normal ranges suggesting that they would correspond to animals that have overcome the parasitaemia but remain as carriers of the haemoparasite. these chronic asymptomatic carriers may serve as reservoirs of the infection and therefore be of serious concern in terms of piroplasmosis control. the lower prevalence of babesia species detected among carrier cattle as compared to carriers of theileria spp., also observed in sheep and horses  <cit> , would be explained by the fluctuations in parasitaemia that occur during the chronic phase of infection by babesia species  <cit>  or the low numbers of intraerythrocytic piroplasms in the circulating bloodstream of babesia carriers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed that subclinical infections are common and that bovine piroplasmosis does not have a clear pattern that allows clinicians to undoubtedly identify animals with babesiosis or theileriosis, particularly in the latter case, in which clinical signs can be highly unspecific. therefore, sensitive and specific laboratorial tests like rlb, which clearly identify the parasite and can detect asymptomatic carriers, are essential to establish good control measures and to avoid unnecessary treatments. in the light of the advantages of rlb, a universal macroarray could be designed to identify all possible piroplasms infecting livestock. the present work is the continuation of our previous studies dealing with the genetic diversity, epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis of piroplasms infecting horses and sheep  <cit> . the application of macroarrays to piroplasm discrimination would help to investigate the host susceptibility and parasite-host specificity relationships.
