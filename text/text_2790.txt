BACKGROUND
previous studies demonstrated that histone modifications such as h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation and h3s <dig> phosphorylation are involved in plant salinity stress  <cit> . chromatin immuno-precipitation  studies indicated that the levels of h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k14ac, h3k23ac and h3k27ac are altered in the coding regions of drought stress-responsive genes, including rd29a , rd29b , and rd <dig> , when they were activated under drought stress conditions  <cit> . besides, the protein profile analysis of salt-responsive proteins suggests that salinity tolerance could be partially controlled by glutathione s-transferase which plays a key role in antioxidant defense mechanisms  <cit> . however, the detailed molecular mechanisms in these processes remain elusive.

it has been proposed that nuclear proteins can read the histone code via their phd finger domain in helas <dig> cells  <cit> . for example, the phd finger containing protein tfiid can selectively anchor to nucleosomes by h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . methylated h3k <dig> is widely considered as a marker of actively transcribing genes due to its ability to recruit other nuclear proteins  <cit> . in plants, phd finger domain containing proteins may be involved in different physiological processes such vernalization-mediated epigenetic silencing and regulation of the flowering time in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . other phd finger domain containing proteins, such as orc <dig>  can bind to h3k4me <dig> to regulate the origin of replication and the transcription process in a. thaliana  <cit> .

there is also evidence supporting the close relationship between phd finger domain containing proteins and salinity stress. the phd fingers of the alfin-like proteins in a. thaliana can bind to histone h3k4me3/ <dig>  <cit>  and the expression of the alfalfa aflin <dig> and alfin1-like  genes are induced under salinity stress  <cit> .

a recent investigation demonstrated that phd homolog proteins in soybean  are localized in the nuclei and are up-regulated under salinity stress  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrated that one of the gmphd proteins  may function as the "code reader" for methylated h3k <dig> in regulating the acetylated h3k <dig>  thereby controlling the expression of targeted genes under salinity stress.

RESULTS
gmphd <dig> is a phd finger domain containing protein
to elucidate the functions of phd proteins in soybean, we obtained the full length coding region of gmphd <dig>  which encompasses  <dig> bp and encodes a protein composed of  <dig> amino acids . smart analysis http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ confirmed the presence of a phd finger domain  in its c terminus . in addition, amino acid sequence alignment analysis  indicated that the phd finger domain of gmphd <dig> also contains features related to its interaction with histone modification. it contains the conserved aromatic amino acids that are important for the phd finger domain to recognize the histone methylated h3k <dig> by forming a groove  <cit>  and the negatively charged amino acids that are important to hold the h3r <dig> methylation in another groove. the result is consistent with other phd finger domain containing proteins  <cit> .

expression of gmphd <dig> in soybean
antibodies against gmphd <dig> were produced by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides . the anti-gmphd <dig> antibodies could recognize a protein with a molecular weight ~ <dig> kd from soybean protein extracts and also the recombinant gst-gmphd <dig> protein. pre-immunization sera were used as negative controls . the molecular weight of gmphd <dig> detected was slightly larger than the expected value , which could be attributed to post-translational modifications. since there is no posttranslational modification when expressed in e. coli, the molecular weight of the recombinant gmphd <dig> was found to be  <dig> kd as expected .

the expression patterns of gmphd <dig> in soybean were studied by western blotting. the gmphd <dig> protein was found to be ubiquitously expressed in both leaves and roots . in addition, the gmphd <dig> protein level was found to be increased upon salinity stress in both tissues .

gmphd <dig> interacts with histone methylated h3k4
sequence alignment analysis with other phd domain containing proteins suggested that gmphd <dig> might interact with histone methylated h3k <dig> . to validate our hypothesis, we expressed the gst-gmphd <dig> fusion protein in e. coli  and incubated it with histone extracted from soybean leaves. our results clearly demonstrated that histone h <dig> and h2a could be co-precipitated by gst-phd <dig>  and methylated histone h3k <dig> was also confirmed in these co-precipitated histone h <dig> .

as h3k <dig> can exist in mono-, di-, or tri- methylated states, we proceeded to determine the preference of gst-gmphd <dig> fusion protein interaction toward these modifications. peptide pull down assays in this study showed that gst-gmphd <dig> exhibited a preferred interaction for the di-methylated h3k <dig> . however, gst-gmphd <dig> could also recognize both h3k4me and h3k4me <dig> with very low affinity , a result that is uncommon in other phd finger domain containing proteins such as ing protein and bptf  <cit> .

identification of non-histone proteins that interacted with gmphd5
we incubated the gst-gmphd <dig> fusion protein with the nuclear extract from soybean to determine whether other nuclear proteins could be recruited by gmphd <dig> . western blotting with anti-methylated h3k <dig> revealed that histone h <dig> was successfully pulled down , validating the notion that gmphd <dig> could recognize histone methylated h3k <dig>  we subsequently identified the pulled down proteins by mass spectrometry. the identities of two non-histone proteins were successfully determined to be elongin a and gnat   respectively.

from the draft soybean genome, we successfully identified two isoforms of gmgnat, namely gmgnat <dig> and gmgnat <dig> . these two isoforms display 89% homology in the nucleotide sequences of their coding region and 87% homology in their amino acid sequences, with both containing the conserved acetyltransferase domain . gmelongin a is a subunit of rna polymerase ii transcription factor siii  with a characteristic signature structure in its n terminus .

the cdna of both genes were subsequently cloned into the mbp vector to generate fusion proteins . these two mbp fusion proteins were used to study the in vitro protein interaction towards gst-phd <dig>  results showed that both mbp-gnat <dig> and mbp-elongin a fusion proteins were pulled down by antibodies against gst-phd <dig> , which validate our previous total nuclear proteins pull down results.

to investigate which part of gmphd <dig> was responsible for its interaction with gmgnat <dig> and gmelongin a, truncated gmphd <dig> analogs were expressed and tested in vitro. the n terminal polypeptide without the phd finger domain and the c terminal polypeptide containing just the phd finger were separately fused with gst . the in vitro pull down assays showed that the n terminal polypeptide of gmphd <dig> exhibited a stronger affinity toward gmgnat <dig> than the phd finger domain . on the other hand, the truncated gmphd <dig> would severely impair its interaction with gmelongin a , indicating the importance of the full length of gmphd <dig> in its interaction with gmelongin a.

gmgnat <dig> is an acetyltransferase
the presence of the acetyltransferase domain in the gmgnat <dig> suggested that it might transfer the acetyl group to its substrates from acetyl-coa. however, its substrates remained elusive.

since gmgnat <dig> interacts with gmphd <dig>  it might be recruited to histone h <dig> via gmphd <dig>  to test whether gmgnat <dig> can acetylate gmphd <dig> and the histone h <dig>  we made use of the antibody that can specifically recognize the acetylated lysine to detect this event. our results showed that acetylation in the extracted soybean histone h <dig> increased when treated with gmgnat <dig> in vitro . since there are several adjacent lysine sites  in the histone h <dig> that are subjected to acetylation, we employed antibodies that can distinguish each site. while the extent of acetylation at histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> and lysine  <dig> did not change much , the acetylated h3k <dig> increased significantly after treatment with gmgnat <dig> . however, no obvious acetylation signals were observed for gmphd <dig> in a similar assay , suggesting that gmphd <dig> might not be the substrate of gmgnat <dig> although they could interact with each other directly.

more interestingly, we found that gmgnat <dig> can be self-acetylated, since the acetylation signal could be detected only when the gmgnat <dig> was present . although the exact site of acetylation on gmgnat <dig> is not yet known, we showed that acetylation of gmgnat <dig> would impair its interaction with gmphd <dig> .

gmphd <dig> also interacts with gmiswi
iswi  is a highly conserved protein found in yeasts to mammals  <cit> . iswi contains several biologically important domains, such as dexdx, helics and sant, and functions in remodelling the chromatin structure by hydrolysing atp. previous reports showed that some phd finger domain containing proteins, such as ing <dig> and ing <dig>  could interact with iswi to facilitate gene transcription  <cit> .

in this investigation, we generated clones of the truncated analogs of soybean iswi : the dexdx domain  and the rest of gmiswi  in e. coli . we found that only mbp-iswi <dig> but not mbp-iswi <dig> could be pulled down by the gst-gmphd <dig> in the gst pull down assay , indicating that the n terminus of gmiswi could interact with gmphd <dig> 

to further confirm the interaction between gmiswi and gmphd, we synthesized peptides of gmphd <dig> and gmiswi <dig> to raise antibodies for co-immunoprecipitation assays . when the nuclear extractions of soybean leaves were immuno-precipitated by anti-gmphd <dig>  gmiswi protein was detected by anti-gmiswi <dig> anti-gmiswi <dig> antibodies in the precipitant . conversely, when the anti-gmiswi <dig> was used to precipitate the soybean nuclear extractions in the first step, gmphd <dig> domain containing proteins could be detected by anti-gmphd <dig> antibodies.

gmphd <dig> located on the promoter and coding region of some salinity stress inducible genes
chromatin immunoprecipitation  was performed using the anti-gmphd <dig> antibody and the soybean chromatin. we detected the interaction between gmphd <dig> and two salinity inducible genes . primer sets  corresponding to the promoter and coding regions of the two salinity inducible genes  were used in this chip experiment. the locations of the predicted amplification regions by these primer sets are shown in figure  <dig>  gmphd <dig> was found to bind to the promoter regions of both genes . for gmrd <dig>  gmphd <dig> also bound to its gene region near the 5' end. as negative control, gmphd <dig> did not show significant binding to the actin gene nor the 3' utr region of gmrd <dig> , indicating that gmphd <dig> was not uniformly distributed in the genome but localized preferentially to the regulatory region of salinity stress inducible genes.

discussion
gmphd <dig> possesses all the essential features and signatures of a phd finger domain containing protein . the level of gmphd <dig> increases when the plant is subjected to salinity stress , suggesting a functional role of gmphd <dig> in stress response. this observation is consistent with a previous finding that gmphd <dig> exhibits a higher expression in drought and salt-tolerant soybean accessions than the sensitive lines  <cit> . incidentally, there are six homologues of phd <dig> in soybean and their responses to abiotic stresses, such as salinity, cold and drought stress, are different, suggesting that although these six gmphds are highly conserved, their functions might be different  <cit> . this work showed that gmphd <dig> may adopt a similar mechanism as the ing  family members by recruiting nuclear protein complexes to conduct the corresponding physiological functions.

gmphd <dig> can interact with methylated h3k <dig> and exhibits amino acid sequence homology to alfin <dig> in alfalfa and alfin1-like protein in a. thaliana. alfin <dig> is a transcriptional factor that binds to the promoter of the salt-inducible mspr <dig> gene and enhances its expression at the transcriptional level in alfalfa roots  <cit> . a soybean phd type transcription factor can also bind to the cis-element ''gtggag'' directly  <cit> . the methylated histone h3k <dig> may not initiate the interactions between gmphd <dig> and its target dna regions. however, methylated h3k <dig>  in particular di-methylated h3k <dig>  could definitely stabilize or enhance such interactions.

studies indicated that the phd finger domain could distinguish the state of lysine methylation. for example, bptf, ing superfamily members and rag <dig> mainly recognize di-, tri methylated histone h3k <dig>  while dnmt3l and bhc <dig> bind to h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . however, there are apparently no findings indicating that the phd finger proteins are able to distinguish h3k4me <dig> from h3k4me <dig>  in the present study, we showed that gmphd <dig> exhibits affinity to three types of histone methylated h3k <dig>  with the following order of preference: di-methylated > mono-methylated > tri-methylated. therefore, gmphd <dig> can distinguish the subtle difference of all methylation states on h3k <dig> 

our present studies have also identified several non-histone proteins that can interact with gmphd <dig>  including gmgnat, gmelonging a and gmiswi. gmgnat belongs to the gnat family, which catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme a to a primary amine. for instance, the yeast gnat selectively transfers an acetyl group to k <dig> of histone h <dig> and to k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . our findings revealed that gmgnat <dig> has the ability to acetylate h3k <dig> and possibly itself. it implies that gmgnat together with gmphd <dig> may play crucial roles in the crosstalk between histone methylation and acetylation on different amino acid residues. however, the self-acetylation pathway of gmgnat is still unclear and a conclusive answer relies on more in depth structural analysis.

histone acetylation is an integral part of transcriptional regulatory systems  <cit> . acetylation can neutralize the positive charge of the histone and attenuate the dna-histone contacts, resulting in the loosening of the chromatin structure to induce gene transcription  <cit> . meanwhile, histone acetylation also affects the interaction between the amino-terminal tails and other non-histone chromatin proteins  <cit> .

our study reports a novel type of histone modification crosstalk between methylated h3k <dig> and acetylated h3k <dig>  that may result in coordinating the regulation of gene transcription. to further explore the gene activation mechanism of the abovementioned histone crosstalk, it is important to identify all transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors that can interact with gmphd <dig>  our work provides evidence to show that gmphd <dig> could recruit gmelongin a  <cit> . it is reported that the elongin complex is a heterotrimer composed of a, b, and c subunits. among them, the subunit a has a function in activating transcription, suggesting that gmelongin may play similar roles. in addition, gmphd <dig> may also recruit the chromatin remodeling factor gmiswi which utilizes the energy from atp hydrolysis to alter nucleosome position and/or structure.

gmphd <dig> protein plays a key role in crosstalk between histone methylation and histone acetylation, recruiting gene transcription factor and chromatin remodeling factor. this implies that the histone methylation-acetylation crosstalk system  forms the basis of the mechanism of gene activation. for instance, since gmphd <dig> is increased upon salinity stress and can interact with the promoter of selected salinity stress induced genes, such a crosstalk system might contribute to a unique transcription regulation mechanism in soybean when subjected to stress.

our chip results suggest the locations of gmphd <dig> in proximal region of promoter region and even within the coding region. it is in agreement with previous findings that methylated h3k <dig> is located in similar regions  <cit> . we suggest that gmphd <dig> and the histone methylation-acetylation crosstalk system may be widely distributed in salinity stress inducible genes and regulate their expressions. in figure  <dig>  we propose a model depicting the epigenetic effects  on the response of soybean towards salinity stress. it seems that the histone di-methylated h3k <dig> of the soybean plant could be significantly increased under high salinity conditions. subsequently, the 'histone code' h3k4me <dig> is recognized by gmphd <dig>  which is found on both the promoter and coding regions of salinity inducible genes  and may act as a regulator during activation of these genes. this regulatory complex could recruit gene expression cofactors, including the chromatin remodeling factor gmiswi, and gene transcriptional elongation factor gmelongin a. in parallel, such regulatory complex could also initiate acetylation of adjacent residues by recruiting histone acetyltransferase, and further activate salinity inducible genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the 'histone code' h3k4me <dig> could be recognized by the salinity stress inducible phd  finger domain containing protein gmphd <dig>  which is found on both the promoter and coding regions of salinity inducible genes  and may act as a regulator during activation of these genes. our data also leads us to propose a model for the gmphd <dig> and the histone methylation-acetylation crosstalk system. we believe our investigation could definitely provide insight for the molecular basis of crosstalk between histone and other nuclear proteins within the nucleosome complex. nonetheless, there are still many other questions to be addressed at the molecular level and further investigation is needed to address the validity of such a hypothesis.
