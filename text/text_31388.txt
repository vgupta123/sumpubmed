BACKGROUND
genetic switches and circuits are abundant in nature and control the regulation and genetic development programs that are at the basis of cellular function. spanning simple feedback loops in b. subtilis competence switching  <cit>  to complex differentiation patterns in humans  <cit> , ultra-stable genetic switches present living organisms with a reliable mode of operation within a noisy state until a signal is received that triggers the transition to a different state of operation. the physical properties, dynamics and stability of genetic switches are important, not only because of their common occurrence in biological systems, but also for their potential use in synthetic biology in the engineering and design of more complicated cellular functions  <cit> .

an important challenge in the successful design of a genetic circuit is the fine-tuning of various circuit parameters  <cit> : in even simple genetic circuit topologies, it is most often necessary to fine-tune the strength and responsiveness of different circuit components in order to achieve intended functional behavior. for instance, the consequences of noise can significantly affect the function of a genetic circuit  <cit> . thus, it is of great interest to develop circuits and components that are readily amenable to experimental control.

among the early demonstrations of the engineering of synthetic circuits, gardner et al. used molecular genetic tools to construct a bistable toggle switch consisting of two genes coding for mutually repressing proteins  <cit> . they also implemented control of the toggle-switch state of operation by using an inducer that could affect transcription in the circuit, and thus, affect its stability . since then, a considerable amount of effort has been put into improving switch robustness, tunability and scalability. for instance deans et al. combined tunability with robustness in a protein-rna genetic switch  <cit> , while green et al. combined robustness with unprecedented scalability using an rna toehold system  <cit> . while both protein and rna switches are commonly used in scientific practice, the focus on robustness, being the lack of dynamics, has led to the fact that not many studies have investigated the dynamics of specific or generic genetic switches. recently, however, shopera et al. investigated the properties of several single and dual-positive feedback synthetic genetic switches, coupling experimental evidence to deterministic mathematical modelling, and amongst other things, generating experimental and theoretical stability diagrams  <cit> . unfortunately, this study was limited by the absence of reliable kinetic information concerning the circuit system in question and by the lack of stochastic analysis, both experimental and theoretical.

here, we discuss in detail a mathematical and computational model for a generic, asymmetric genetic toggle switch, following up on our previous reports on symmetric genetic switches  <cit> . in these toggle switches, the active repressor species is a protein dimer. this class of switch was demonstrated to have a large dynamic range of switching frequency over a relatively small gene expression efficiency window  <cit> .

at first we treat the general case, where the two mutually inhibiting genetic circuits are equivalent, except for a chosen set of kinetic constants making it asymmetric. for this circuit, we show that it is possible to reduce the system to two coupled non-linear differential equations that depend on only four tunable parameters . this is analogous to the analysis that was conducted in  <cit>  with focus on a symmetric switch.

next we use the framework of the general asymmetric toggle switch to develop a detailed mathematical model for an experimentally realizable switch. to make the model construct as accurate as possible, we elected to use transcription factors for which we can utilize the greatest amount of quantitative data. we decided to utilize the laci and tetr repressors, which we will denote the litr-switch. these repressors are especially interesting because they are amenable to fine-tuning by the addition of iptg and doxycyline , allowing the degree of asymmetry caused by their differing expression strengths to be easily modified experimentally. using values for kinetic constants derived from literature, we explored the circuit’s states of operation through both stochastic and deterministic simulations. interestingly, some of our findings can be related to properties of the circuit previously studied in vivo by gardner et al.  <cit> , since one of their constructed toggle switches is quite similar in design.

RESULTS
the generic bistable genetic switch is schematically depicted in fig. 1: two genes, each encoding a repressor, affect each other through homodimers. for gene  <dig>  the promoter has two operator domains for repressor binding, and they are specific for the repressor encoded by gene  <dig>  additionally, we will assume that the homodimers will bind cooperatively at the two binding sites. the situation is similar for gene  <dig>  for the mathematical model of a bistable switch with laci-tetr repressors  we additionally have access to two inducers.

under the “adiabatic” approximation that all the binding-unbinding reactions are in equilibrium, the resultant dynamics for the active transcription factor level, t <dig> and t <dig>  is given by the following set of coupled nonlinear differential equations: 
  <dig> dt1dt=2θ1t1λ11+ν11+μ1t2−2t1+2κ1θ1t13/2dt2dt=2θ2t2λ21+ν21+μ2t1−2t2+2κ2θ2t23/ <dig> 

where the parameters are all defined in the methods section. the form of eq.  lends itself to the following interpretation: since the first term is always positive, we may consider it an effective synthesis rate in a birth-death process. the second term is always negative and would correspond to the decay rate in such a process. the synthesis term of a dimer is proportional to the root of its own concentration, since the dimer must be produced from the monomer and equilibrium is assumed to occur instantaneously. the first part of this term corresponds to protein synthesis at full repression, while the second represents repression by the competing agent. furthermore, the first part of the decay term represents degradation of dimers, while the second represents that of the monomers. this result is the generalization of the symmetric hom <dig> circuit in ghim and almaas   <cit>  to the situation where the two interacting genes have different characteristics.

in the calculations culminating in eq. , we have applied approximations - described in the methods section and the simplification that the dissociation parameters kl7=kl <dig>  we do not believe that these significantly reduce the generality of eq. . the main assumption here is the adiabatic assumptions  and , that the repressor binding and dimerization as well as transcriptional elongation reactions are in steady state. while making the problem analytically tractable, this assumption has been shown to have only minor effects on the results of genetic switch simulations  <cit> . the mentioned simplification of the two dissociation parameters equates the rnapol binding constants in a promoter singly and doubly bound by repressors. though this is not the case in a general system, the simplification still preserves the effect of double repressor binding. even thought the binding of the second repressor does not affect transcription initiation efficiency directly, it reduces the probability of a repressor-free promoter, thus thereby still reducing the average transcription rate. additionally, when exploring the properties of the system, we have made the simplifying assumptions γlp=γp and kl2=k <dig>  the first assumption equates the protein degradation rates of the two switch-components. this is true for e.coli in exponential growth phase, as protein degradation in that case is dominated by dilution due to cell division  <cit> . the final assumption is that the affinities of the two repressor types for their respective promoters are the same. this assumption was implemented in order to restrict the exploration of the system to only two parameters, as seen in the next section.

reduced system: deterministic and stochastic analysis
we solve eq.  numerically for the steady state at different parameter values, and we identified the number of stable steady states. the parameters that we choose to vary are s and β, which take part in parameters ν,μ and λ of eq. . it can be seen in the methods section that s corresponds to promoter leakage, while β represents gene expression efficiency. unless otherwise noted, the parameter values used in this null cline analysis are the same as in  <cit>   and as listed in table  <dig>  these parameter values will also serve as a bistable reference point in the s−β phase plane.

we start exploring the effect of circuit parameter asymmetry on the stability of the toggle switch by changing pairs of similar parameters describing the two genes. figure  <dig> shows the consequences of varying the leakage from each of the promoters, described by the parameters s <dig> and s <dig>  for a sequence of gene expression efficiencies β={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> }. the sl parameters can take values independent of each other, and to a quite high extent, their values may be modified by genetic manipulation. since all the parameters, except from s <dig> and s <dig>  are chosen to be identical in the two genes, the symmetry around the diagonal in the plot is to be expected, and thus serves as an internal consistency check on our calculations. we note a non-linear change in the shape of the bistability region in response to changing β: as β is decreasing towards β∼ <dig> nm− <dig>  the bistable region is expanding. however, further decreases in β lead to a sharp contraction of the bistable region.

the individual gene expression efficiency from each of the promoters, described by the parameters β <dig> and β <dig>  are able to vary independently of each other. the β-variables can potentially be modified by genetic manipulation, especially by modifying the corresponding 5’utr regions , making the β <dig> vs β <dig> stability diagram of great interest. figure  <dig> displays the region of bistability  for the sequence of values s={ <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> }. as promoter leakage s increases, the bistable region shows a systematic decrease.

we will later simulate the full reaction set of the litr-system, as described by eqs. - and, for the sake of brevity, do not present such simulations of the current circuit. previously, we employed an approximate representation of the stochastic dynamics for the symmetric version of the circuit  <cit> : assuming a simple birth-death process where the propensities for synthesis and decay are described by eq. , this stochastic system is governed by the average rates we calculated under the adiabatic assumptions -, which we detail in the methods section.

we also conduct a stochastic exploration of the stability diagram  reported in fig.  <dig> by keeping the pair of the leakage/efficiency parameters at their reference values, s1= <dig> β1= <dig>  nm− <dig>  while varying s <dig> and β <dig> as indicated by the axes in fig.  <dig>  the bistable gene-switch system has two possible starting points: either gene  <dig> is in an active state  or in an inactive state , and we use both conditions as starting points for two separate  <dig> time-step and  <dig> time-step simulations.

the results reported in fig.  <dig> show that the bistable region determined by stochastic simulations lies within, and almost entirely fills, the one calculated using deterministic analysis. the switching rate is not of great practical relevance here, because the time is scaled relative to that of the protein decay rate. the high switching rate region that extends out of the deterministic bistable region corresponds to a situation where the two genes behave independently of one another .

litr system: stochastic analysis
following our analysis of the generalized reduced genetic switch, we decided to develop a realistic model for a switch that could be experimentally implemented. we simulated the circuit and looked at its dynamic properties.

for this we needed to identify two transcription factors for which enough kinetic data is available and which state of operation could be tunable with small molecule inducers. the tunability is necessary to make the circuit accessible to experimental manipulation for mapping out its stability states. the choice of small molecule inducers for the circuit manipulation  was to make the in vivo experimental system tunable and possible to re-set.

thus, we selected to analyze a genetic switch composed of the laci and tetr factors and their non-metabolizable inducers, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  and doxycycline  respectively. in our model of the laci-tetr bistable genetic switch, the litr system, we explicitly include modules for the dna binding of these transcription factors, based on literature information . a literature search resulted in numeric values for  <dig> different kinetic parameters to support our model development . as a result, the number of species in our model description grew from  <dig> for the generic asymmetric circuit to  <dig> for litr, and the number of reactions increased considerably. the increase in complexity was largely due to the addition of small-molecule bound species, e.g. laci-iptg complexes, and their corresponding reactions. note that, adding iptg or dox would result in effective changes in the definition of β and s parameters of the reduced system. moreover, laci was found to be active mostly in its tetrameric form, which can bind two different sites at once on the dna, unlike the tetr dimer that only can bind a single site. this makes the switch asymmetric both by the values of kinetic constants and by the number and type of reactions that are involved. a list of all reactions in the litr switch is shown in table  <dig>  while a summary of the parameters we obtained can be found in table  <dig>

we decided to investigate the stability of the circuit from a stochastic perspective. to this end, we simulated the full system for time-courses of  <dig> s, each implemented with a state sampling every second. we ran two independent simulations with initial conditions being either  <dig> laci tetramers or  <dig> tetr dimers, all other proteins and mrna species numbers set to zero. we determined the stability by looking at the distributions of Δ=− over the time course of the simulation assuming three possible stability scenarios:  monostability would occur if, for both initial conditions, the switch would be turned to the same side with overwhelming probability.  bistability would be determined if the initial conditions gave rise to two non-intersecting distributions of Δ. finally,  the Δ distribution could be bistable but with switching occurring between the two states .

we investigated the stability of our circuit as a function of  and , as well as of plasmid copy number. the results can be seen in fig. 3: given just one copy of each gene, the stochastic simulations did not identify any disjoint bistability, ie. there was always switching between the two states: the slowest switching between the two possible states occurs at low inducer concentrations, with a frequency corresponding to a time scale of days. at a plasmid copy number of two ) a small bistable region appears , and the size of the region of disjoint bistability increases with plasmid copy number. this bistable region appears to be within the range of  and , where changes in their concentrations have experimentally been shown to bring about changes in transcription rates  <cit> .
fig.  <dig> stability in stochastic and deterministic simulations of the laci-tetr  genetic switch. the stability plots represent the same genetic circuit with different plasmid copy numbers, ie. the total copy number of laci and tetr genes: a  <dig> copy, b  <dig> copies, c  <dig> copies, and d  <dig> copies. monostable regions are represented in white. the dotted black line encloses the deterministically determined bistable regions. joint bistable regions  are represented as heat plots in colors from purple to red. the heat bars represent the switching frequency in hz. black regions represent bistable regions where no switching occurred for the duration of the simulation time 



in all cases, we observe a joint bistable region with high switching rate at large inducer concentrations. in this region, the number of transcription factors not bound to inducers is very close to zero. consequently, the lack of regulation makes the two genes virtually decoupled and constitutively expressed. also, it appears that laci is a more potent transcriptional repressor than tetr, because at zero  and  the system is monostable, with laci being the “winning” species. this agrees well with experimental observations of gardner et al.  <cit> . here, laci was expressed under the control of a weaker promoter  than the tetr  in the litr circuit. consequently, it was necessary to further reduce its strength in order to experimentally observe bistability. in our case, both species are expressed under the same pr promoter, which should give rise to strong monostability in the absence of inducers. it is worth noting that in these simulations, we use the laci binding operator osym, which is much stronger than o <dig> used by gardner et al. nevertheless, when we conducted simulations of the system with appropriately reduced operator strength to explore this effect , the results showed only minor deviations. in this case we used the binding constant for the o <dig> operator taken from garcia et al.  <cit> . we also observed that, if the copy number of tetr gene was set to four times that of laci, the litr system becomes bistable at zero inducer concentration . thus the relative gene copy numbers could be used as a separate parameter to tune the symmetry of genetic switches.

an interesting practical application of these observations would be to initialize the switch into a desired state, or to randomize its state, by altering the inducer concentrations . in fig.  <dig> we display histograms of Δ for three different titration schemes, depicted in panel : panel , a titration scheme in which the  and  are increased simultaneously, and panels  and , where the concentration of either inducer is increased independently. in fig.  <dig> we find that the protein copy numbers realized in the bistable region depend on the monostable state from which this region is approached. thus, the joint bistable region that surrounds disjoint bistability corresponds to the situation where one of the potential wells is shallow while the other is deep.

a dilution experiment starting from any point in the diagram in fig.  <dig> would result in an - phase-space movement along a straight line towards the origin. thus, the switch could keep both its state and bistability upon dilution if the stability diagram would be more symmetric than what is shown here. a symmetrization of the bistability phase plot could be achieved for this system by adjusting plasmid copy numbers . the histogram from running the system along a titration trajectory near the diagonal in fig.  <dig> can be seen in fig.  <dig>  similarly, if  and  would be set to large values within the fast-switching bistable region of fig.  <dig>  a dilution would result in a  randomization of the switch values that would depend on the starting concentrations of the inducers.

litr system: deterministic analysis
in order to investigate the agreement between stochastic modelling and deterministic analysis, we performed a deterministic stability analysis of the litr system. the results of the analysis are given in fig.  <dig>  here, the borders of the deterministically determined bistable regions are displayed as dashed black lines. it can be seen that the bistable regions of the stochastic simulation lie within the boundaries determined deterministically with the exception of the circuit with just one copy of each gene ). interestingly, the stochastic simulation in this case shows laci to be a stronger transcriptional repressor than in the deterministic analysis: in panel fig.  <dig>  we see that the bistability region is shifted towards larger values of , and it is especially evident for  ∼ <dig>  this effect is likely explained by a combination of the shallowness of the wells in the potential landscape at small inducer concentrations and our definition of bistability: the definition is based on the time that the system spends with > and vice versa, not on the shape of the potential landscape. this is because the potential landscape can be rugged, which increases the likelihood of detecting false wells. at larger gene copy numbers, stochastic and deterministic simulations agree very well. this is likely owing to the increased depth of the potential wells in that case. also, the deterministic analysis does not identify the stochastically determined fast switching bistable region  as bistable. this is again related to our definition of bistability for the stochastic simulation. in this case, the potential well is very narrow and centered at zero .

discussion
in this article we have analyzed and outlined the workings of an asymmetric genetic switch. at first, we looked at a generalized example of a bistable genetic switch. while it was relatively straightforward to simplify and theorize, it was challenging to relate this specific circuit implementation to experimental realizations, because its asymmetry-controlling parameters are difficult to access directly in an experimental setting. therefore, we conducted an investigation of a realistic circuit, the litr system, based on a mutually repressing laci-tetr design. while this is challenging to simplify, the computational time needed for direct stochastic and deterministic simulations of this system is not prohibitive. since we use small molecules and the gene copy numbers to tune circuit symmetry and stability, it does not appear unrealistic to experimentally verify or disprove our findings. additionally, by letting fluorescent reporters to be under the control of laci and tetr, one could explore the bistability states of the - plane for different gene and plasmid copy number combinations. if sufficiently automated, this could provide us with diagrams similar to those in fig.  <dig> 

we further propose that the above  bistable switch could be used as a memory component in a genetic measuring device serving for, e.g. monitoring of biochemical environments. if one uses microorganisms for measuring a quantity in a visually accessible environment, it would be possible to employ a microscope to directly observe and measure the expression of a fluorescent reporter. if the measuring location was less accessible, one could imagine extracting the microorganism before performing a measurement. however, there is the possibility that the extraction procedure would perturb the measured values. one solution could be a system that would measure for some time, followed by a period where its detection state is stably maintained while it is extracted and measured. here is a brief outline of how this could be achieved: 
a chemical or physical molecular sensor is set to slightly influence the expression of either tetr or laci.

the concentrations of iptg and dox are set such that the bistable switch is entered into the fast switching regime, at a location in the phase space where a dilution curve  would be completely contained within the bistable region of the - plane. microorganisms containing the above constructs are put into the environment to be measured.

as the inducers are diluted, the environment will influence the switch to either be biased toward the tetr- or laci-dominated states. as the systems enter the disjoint bistable region of the iptg-dox plane due to dilution, the population distribution of the switch between the two states will depend on the measured parameters.

the microorganisms may now be extracted from the environment without risk of perturbing their states, as in this region of the - phase-space the bistable switch is locked into a state by the decreasing inducer concentrations.

the states of the switches are measured.



in order to function properly, this approach requires the switch in question to posses the following properties. firstly, the switch must be bistable in the absence of inhibitors. this is required to preserve the states of the switch throughout the extraction time. secondly, the bistable region of the switch in inhibitor space must be roughly linear to fully contain a dilution curve. finally, it is necessary that the bias introduced by the measurement step is small enough not to push the system out of the bistable phase and into monostability when inhibitors are diluted. in the case of the litr switch, the first requirement is at first glance not met. however, as discussed above, it is possible to tune both the overall and the relative copy numbers of the two repressors to make the switch symmetric and bistable  in the absence of inhibitors. the second requirement is related to the overall structure of the two-inhibitor system. in our case, a dilution curve can be plotted within the bistable region and exit into the fast switching region, but this may not necessarily be the case for other switch architectures. finally, limiting the bias imposed by the molecular sensor on the system performance and properties could be addressed both by modifying the sensor itself, and by increasing the gene copy number in order to widen the bistable region. overall, the above requirements put strong constraints on the choice of switch components.

CONCLUSIONS
the problem of creating a biomolecular measuring device with memory has previously been addressed by bhomkar et al., where a recording device was made using a similar switch circuit  <cit> . however, its principle relied on the inhibition of bacterial division in order to prevent the reporter used for measuring from becoming diluted after the actual measurements were performed. our method, if practical, does not require such radical precautions. with enough default switch stability, measurements could be recorded after an arbitrary amount of time or an arbitrary number of cell divisions. this stability would be ensured by the fact that each cell stores a binary value, that is relatively easy to preserve. the continuous measured value is then determined from the distribution cells between the two states of the recording device. using stochastic and deterministic modelling with literature based reaction kinetics we demonstrated that a genetic switch based on the laci and the tetr transcriptional repressors shows the necessary dynamics to function as such a recording device. we also derived a simplified model for a generalized asymmetric genetic switch, which showed dynamic behaviour similar to the specific case. overall our modelling provides clues as to how a genetic switch with desirable stability and dynamic properties could be constructed in vivo, whether or not it will be used in a recording device.
