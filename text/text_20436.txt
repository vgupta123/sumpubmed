BACKGROUND
although tissue-specific gene expression has been associated with bias in codon usage in certain multicellular organisms including humans, drosophila melanogaster, and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , very little data currently exists for most organisms, particularly regarding the role of gender-specific tissues and gametes. one of the few studies addressing the effect of gender, in drosophila, suggests that genes having a higher ratio of female to male expression have a greater bias in codon usage  <cit> . a largely unstudied biological system where gender-specific gene expression could significantly alter codon usage is plants. recent findings, in a. thaliana, have indicated that male gametes pass on a greater number of induced harmful mutations to their offspring, suggesting that mutations are subject to less selection in male tissues/gametes than in female tissues/gametes  <cit> . such findings at the population level , suggest that gender could also impact the selective processes that alter molecular evolution in plants, including the usage of synonymous codons. given that gender-specific selective pressures on codon usage could alter gene evolution and structure, and thereby influence population genetics, disease, and/or reproductive biology, and given the general lack of data to date, further investigation is warranted. here, we focus on the evaluation of gender-specific codon usage in plants.

nonrandom use of synonymous codons is a prevalent phenomenon observed in a diverse range of organisms  <cit> . a bias in codon usage occurs when synonymous codons are not all used at the same frequency in coding dna  <cit> . such bias in codon usage could result from mutational pressure, as indicated by a positive correlation between the nucleotide content of third codon positions and adjacent introns  <cit> , or from selective pressure. selective pressure has been supported by two findings. firstly, greater levels of bias in codon usage are generally associated with a greater frequency of "preferred" codons   <cit> , a trend that corresponds to the abundance and/or gene number of trna in bacteria, yeast, c. elegans, drosophila, arabidopsis and other organisms  <cit> . secondly, bias in codon usage has been well correlated to the level of gene expression, with the greatest bias occurring in highly expressed genes  <cit> . each of these findings suggests that the use of preferred codons confers fitness benefits that enhance translational efficiency, a phenomenon particularly advantageous for the highly expressed genes  <cit> . in this regard, gene expression level is an essential component of understanding gender-specific influences on codon usage.

the main challenges for comparing male and female codon usage relative to gene expression for plant species, where the availability of genomic dna sequences is often limited, are obtaining sufficient coding dna data to assess codon usage in those tissues and determining the level of gene expression. est datasets provide an effective solution to both issues. in particular, est data have proven to be an effective means of quantifying gene expression in a range of tissues as the extent of redundancy in ests reflects the abundance of mrna in the tissue or cells from which the library was obtained  <cit> . in addition, the increased availability of est data, the long sequence length  and the level of accuracy of the sequence data   <cit>  makes it possible to study codon usage directly from est sequences, even before the corresponding genomic sequences are available  <cit> . in this regard, the recent availability of male- and female-specific est libraries in plants provide an effective resource to better understand selection on codon usage and how it may be influenced by gender.

in the present study, the main goal was to assess whether gender-specific gene expression per se and gender-specific gene expression level are correlated with codon usage in zea mays and triticum asestivum. as a supplemental analysis, we compared the bias in codon usage for genes expressed only in gametophytic tissue  and in flower tissue  at both high and low expression levels in brassica napus. given that gene function and protein length  <cit> , have previously been found to influence codon usage, we also evaluated the role of those parameters within our analysis.

RESULTS
in order to compare codon usage relative to gender-specific expression, we collected data from sperm and egg est libraries for z. mays and anther and ovary libraries for t. aestivum . microspore and flower libraries were obtained for b. napus. in brief, we obtained gender/tissue-specific datasets in the following manner: 1) clustering and assembly of ests from each library using cap <dig>  <cit> , 2) identification of unigenes  having translation products that matched known or hypothetical proteins in a. thaliana , 3) extraction of genes with tissue-specific expression by comparisons between the two compared tissues for each species   <cit> , and 4) determination of the expression level per gene . the six tissue-specific sequence datasets obtained are: z. mays sperm-specific genes , z. mays egg-specific genes , t. aestivum anther-specific genes , t. aestivum ovary-specific genes , b. napus microspore-specific genes  and b. napus flower-specific genes . note that gender-specific genes represent those that are specific to a particular tissue or gamete  when compared to only one other tissue or gamete  and not relative to all tissues from the plant. thus, these gene sets are larger than one would have found if the ests had been compared to all tissues of a plant. subsequently, the gc content at third nucleotide positions  and the frequency of preferred codons , each of which have been shown to be effective indicators of bias in codon usage  <cit> , were determined for every gene from each of the tissue-specific datasets. bias in codon usage was quantified using a single est sequence to represent each gene . the data show, as described in detail below, that genes specific to female tissues and gametes have a greater bias in codon usage in both z. mays and t. aestivum than genes expressed in male tissues and gametes. as well, male microspores have a greater bias than the heterogeneous tissues of the flower in b. napus.

the gc content at third nucleotide positions and the frequency of preferred codons were each statistically significantly higher for genes expressed specifically in eggs as compared to sperm in z. mays and for genes expressed in ovary as compared to anther in t. aestivum . this result was statistically significant for genes expressed at both high and at low levels  as well as across all genes. statistically significant higher values for gc <dig> were detected in microspore-specific genes as compared to the flower-specific genes in b. napus for genes expressed at low levels, but not for highly expressed genes . within the male-specific and the female-specific genes, gc <dig> and fpr were statistically significantly greater for the highly expressed as opposed to the lowly expressed genes in both z. mays and t. aestivum and for the male-specific specific as compared to flower-specific genes in b. napus. notably, lowly-expressed female-specific genes have a statistically significant higher gc <dig> and fpr than the highly expressed male-specific genes in z. mays and no difference was detected between these two groups for t. aestivum. most of the statistically significant comparisons  remained significant after bonferroni correction except for some contrasts among genes for high versus low expression within a gender  and a single between gender comparison for fpr at high expression levels in t. aestivum . all other between gender comparisons remained statistically significant.

the relative synonymous codon usage  represents the observed frequency of a codon divided by the expected frequency   <cit> . values different from  <dig>  thus indicate the presence of bias. analysis of rscu for genes with male-specific and female-specific expression  indicated that the bias in codon usage towards species-specific preferred codons was consistently higher in the female than in male tissues/gametes for z. mays and t. aestivum . in particular,  <dig> of  <dig> of the species-specific preferred codons for  <dig> amino acids in z. mays   <cit>  were more frequent in female-specific than in male-specific genes. this represents a higher usage of at least one species-specific preferred codon for every amino acid with synonymous codons . for t. aestivum, female-specific genes had a greater usage of all  <dig> of the species-specific preferred codons . in addition, hierarchical clustering was conducted using pearson correlation coefficients between rscu values for each combination of species and gender-specific tissues/gametes for z. mays and t. aestivum  <cit> . the results indicate that these groups cluster by gender rather than by species, consistent with gender being a major parameter in shaping codon usage . the rscu data also show that b. napus demonstrates a preference towards gc ending codons in male-specific as compared to flower-specific genes . the entire dataset across all species consisted of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> codons.

given that bias in codon usage has been inversely associated with protein length in certain eukaryotic organisms , we assessed whether it played a role in the observed gender-specific bias described above. for this, we identified the protein length for each gene under study  in the arabidopsis thaliana protein sequence database . we used protein lengths from arabidopsis because our dna sequence data was derived from ests  and because, unlike well-studied model organisms, the complete and/or annotated genomic dna or protein sequences are not yet available for most of the genes in these plants. protein lengths tend to be highly conserved among eukaryotes  <cit> . the data indicates that the mean protein length was greater for male-specific genes than female-specific genes in z. mays and t. aestivum and for flower-specific genes as compared to male-specific genes in b. napus : z. mays egg  <dig>  , z. mays sperm  <dig>  , t. aestivum ovary  <dig>  , t. aestivum anther  <dig>  , b. napus microspore  <dig> , b. napus flower  <dig>  ). the higher mean lengths generally resulted from the presence of a relatively few genes that encoded very long proteins . the number of genes encoding proteins with more than  <dig> amino acids relative to the total number of genes are: zea mays egg 38/ <dig> =  <dig> %,. z. mays sperm 80/ <dig> =  <dig> %, t. aestivum ovary 69/ <dig> =  <dig> %, t. aestivum anther 368/ <dig> =  <dig> %, b. napus microspore 51/ <dig> =  <dig> %, b. napus flower 176/ <dig> =  <dig> %. we thus determined rscu values for genes encoding proteins of similar lengths, in order to assess whether this protein length variation was related to our findings of gender-specific biases in codon usage. for this, male-specific and female-specific genes from each species under study  were classified as being of either short , medium  or of long length .

comparisons were conducted for rscu values relative to gender for z. mays and t. aestivum  for the concatenated est sequences  within each protein length category. the results show that female-specific genes consistently have higher values for rscu for the preferred codons  within each of these three protein length categories for z. mays and t. aestivum   indicating that protein length variation does not explain the gender-specific bias observed for specific codons described in table  <dig> . the bias in codon usage for male-specific versus flower-specific genes in b. napus was most evident for genes encoding long proteins.

given that the codons showing bias generally ended in g or c for each of the species examined , we also compared the gc <dig> content between each of the two tissue/gamete types per species for each of the protein length categories . the results of pairwise comparisons show that the gc <dig> values are statistically significantly higher for female-specific than male-specific genes in z. mays and t. aestivum and for male-specific than flower-specific genes in b. napus within each of the protein length categories, consistent with a gender-bias on codon usage. examination of only those genes encoding very long proteins  showed similar trends for each of these species. notably, gc <dig> values were inversely correlated with protein length within each of the six species and tissue-specific datasets  , consistent with the relationship between codon usage and protein length reported in other species  <cit> .

biological function has been proposed as a potential factor altering certain molecular evolutionary processes  <cit> ; therefore we examined the gene profiles for each of the contrasting tissues for each species under study. the profile of biological functions of genes expressed only in the female tissues/gametes and male tissues/gametes were nearly identical for z. mays and for t. aestivum . similarly, the biological functions for genes specifically expressed in male microspores and those expressed in flowers were strongly associated in b. napus.

discussion
gender differences in codon usage
the statistically significant higher gc content at third codon positions and the greater frequency of preferred codons for genes expressed specifically in eggs as compared to sperm in z. mays and for genes expressed in the ovary as compared to anther in t. aestivum, provide strong evidence that there is a greater bias in codon usage for genes expressed in female tissues than in male tissues and/or gametes . these findings were similar when genes were classified as either high expressing or low expressing, suggesting that gender has a substantial impact on synonymous codon use. we can infer that these differences are likely due to selective pressure because the bias is associated with gene expression . furthermore, the data indicate that the gender effect cannot be attributed to variation in protein lengths or to gene function . overall, these results, across a broad range of genes, provide evidence that codon usage is altered by gender-specific pressures in plants.

genes expressed in eggs have a higher relative synonymous codon usage value than those expressed in sperm for  <dig> of the  <dig> previously identified preferred codons for z. mays, and indicates, remarkably, that selective pressure in eggs specifically acts to enhance the frequency of preferred codons for each of the  <dig> amino acids that have synonymous codons . similar findings for t. aestivum, showing that all  <dig> of the preferred codons for this species are enhanced in genes expressed in the ovary as compared to the anther, also demonstrate that a selective pressure inherent to these female organs and gametes is acting to enhance the incidence of preferred codons across all synonymous codon groups. in addition, the fact that the female-bias was detected for each gene length category  and that the gender-specific gene expression was the major determinant of hierarchical clustering , rather than species , supports the notion that the codon usage bias demonstrated here is greatly influenced by gender-specific factors. it is notable for t. aestivum that in three cases the rscu was greater for female-than male-specific genes  for g or c ending codons that had not been previously identified as preferred, but had been described as preferred in z. mays and other plant species  <cit> . the overall results presented here, showing greater use of preferred codons in genes expressed in female organs and gametes, suggests that these codons are probably also preferred in t. aestivum, at least for genes expressed in the reproductive tissues and gametes.

the greater bias in codon usage among genes expressed in female organs and gametes as compared to male organs and gametes, reflecting an increased propensity for translational selection, could be caused by several factors. in particular, it is possible that protein products of genes expressed in female organs and gametes experience a more diverse biochemical environment than their male counterparts, a phenomenon that could lead to greater selective constraint on proteins  <cit> , and thus, on their translation. it is also possible that mutations at third codon positions in genes expressed in female organs and gametes may on average have greater effects on fitness, as has been proposed for genes expressed across a broad array of tissues   <cit> . this could occur, for example, if translational inefficiency in female organs and gametes alters the cellular energy resources or interferes with essential biological processes in a manner not prevalent in male regions. mutations affecting female regions could also have greater fitness effects because of the general uncertainty in the pollination process, which makes it highly advantageous for each ovary, ovule and/or egg to be fully functional   <cit>  and because maternal traits can have a much greater impact on seed production  and survival   <cit> . another possible explanation for the observed results is that there are differences in gene function between female and male organs and gametes, a theory that has been proposed as a potential factor altering amino acid substitution rates  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  however, this is not the likely explanation in this study, as there is remarkable similarity in the biological functions represented by the male-specific and female-specific genes in both z. mays and t. aestivum. nonetheless, subtle differences in gene function  or other, unidentified, functional differences between the male and female tissues/gametes could play a role  <cit> . an additional potential contributing factor worth consideration is that genes that have greater breadth of expression throughout the entire plant   <cit> , are coincidentally also more commonly expressed in female organs and gametes than in males. although this possibility cannot be definitively excluded, it seems unlikely given the similarity between the functional profiles of female- and male-specific genes. altogether, it seems that the best explanations are differences in the amount of selective pressure for effective translation due to different cellular environments and/or a greater impact of mutations on female tissues and gametes. further studies will nonetheless be needed to ascertain the mechanisms underlying the greater bias in codon usage in female organs and gametes in these plant species.

the relationship between gender-specific gene expression and codon usage in z. mays and t. aestivum is consistent with the very limited data currently available for other organisms. it has been shown in humans, for example, that genes expressed in ovaries have likely been under slightly greater selective constraint than testes for codon usage following the divergence of humans and mice  <cit> . the trend notably corresponds to the generally high rates of protein evolution  reported in genes involved in spermatogenesis in primates  <cit> . in drosophila, it has been found that the relative expression of genes in females versus males  is well correlated to bias in codon usage  <cit> . in addition, in arabidopsis, previous findings have indicated that more induced harmful mutations are passed to progeny by the sperm than by the eggs, consistent with the relatively lower selective pressure on mutations in male than in female tissues and gametes  <cit> . the present results extend these findings to include gender-specific selection on codon usage. each of these gender-specific trends, in humans, drosophila, and arabidopsis are consistent with the findings we report here, and suggest that the higher bias in codon usage for genes expressed in female tissues could be inherent to a range of organisms. further studies will be needed to better understand the full range of organisms for which gender-specific gene expression is associated with a bias in codon usage.

gene expression level
gene expression level has been shown to be positively correlated with bias in codon usage in many organisms  <cit> . selection is the best explanation for this finding because higher levels of gene expression lead to greater opportunity for selection to alter codon usage  <cit>  and because mutational bias has only rarely been associated with gene expression level   <cit> . in drosophila, a positive relationship between gene expression and bias in codon usage has been reported for female tissues, but a relatively weak negative correlation was detected for male tissues  <cit> . our findings of greater values for gc <dig> and fpr for highly expressed genes than for lowly expressed genes for both male-specific and female-specific genes from z. mays and t. aestivum suggests that gene expression level is positively correlated to bias in codon usage for genes expressed in male and in female regions for these plants.

it is notable nonetheless that we found that the differences in the bias in codon usage between highly and lowly expressed genes were not as marked the male as in female tissues and gametes, as evidenced by the fact that the bonferroni correction excluded the statistical significance of this comparison for both z. mays and t. aestivum. in fact, the lowly expressed female-specific genes had statistically significantly higher bias in codon usage than the highly expressed male-specific genes in z. mays and no difference was detected between these two groups for t. aestivum . it thus seems that female tissues/gametes maintain substantial selective pressure on codon usage even for genes with reduced expression, in a manner not characteristic of male tissues/gametes.

selection and gender-bias
the greater bias in codon usage for female-specific than for male-specific genes is currently best explained by selection. this is for the following reason. the male-specific and female-specific gene sets examined here were determined based on calculations that these genes were solely or primarily expressed in one tissue type and not in the other . thus, the observed effects are associated with gender-specific gene expression . in addition, our data indicate that gene function and protein length variation between male and female tissues/gametes do not explain the observed bias in codon usage between the gender-specific gene sets. gene expression level differences cannot be implicated because the gender bias was detected for genes expressed at similar levels  . notably, because we examined ests for the present analysis, which rarely contain introns, and studied plant species where annotated genomic dna  is not yet available , we do not include an analysis of the gc  content of introns versus third codon positions in our genes, an approach sometimes used to exclude mutational bias  <cit> . nevertheless, each of these trends, taken in their entirety, suggest that the bias in codon usage associated with gender-specific expression is best explained by differential selective pressure on genes expressed in male-specific tissues/gametes versus female-specific tissues/gametes.

male-specific versus flower-specific genes in brassica napus
although the differences in bias in codon usage between the microspore and flower in b. napus were generally lower in magnitude than the previous between gender comparisons for z. mays and t. aestivum , the data overall indicates that genes expressed in the two b. napus tissues have specific patterns of codon usage. specifically, the higher gc content in b. napus microspore-specific genes than in flower-specific genes suggests that the male portion of the flower may be under more selective pressure for codon usage than the flower as a whole. in particular, given that the flower and flower bud est library should represent genes from the male, female and vegetative  tissue, one can infer that the combined vegetative and female tissue is under less selective pressure than the microspore. given that the vegetative tissue usually represents the greatest fraction of the flower tissue   <cit> , then it could, in turn, be inferred that the somatic region is likely under reduced selective pressure for codon usage than the microspore . the fact that the gc content at third codon positions of the genes specifically expressed in the microspores varied markedly among synonymous codon groups , and was found to be positively correlated to gene expression level , further supports the notion that translational selection is enhanced in the microspore component of the flower. moreover, from examination of table  <dig>  it is evident that for six of seven comparisons where the differences in rscu between tissues were greater than  <dig> , the microspore had enhanced usage of g or c ending codons , a trend consistent with greater selective pressure. notably, analysis of rscu values relative to protein length suggests that differences between male-specific and flower-specific genes are greatest for genes encoding longer proteins  in the b. napus tissue comparisons as these genes have substantially greater usage of g or c ending codons in this category . this effect could be partially caused by the greater percentage of genes encoding very long proteins in the flower-specific dataset or by greater male-specific effects on codon usage for genes encoding longer proteins. nonetheless, all three of the gene length categories demonstrate higher gc <dig> values for male-specific genes . one possible interpretation of all of these findings in b. napus, when combined with the data from z. mays and t. aestivum, is that the translational selection increases in the following order: flower-specific  genes, male-specific genes, female-specific genes. because these analyses are in different species, however, further evaluation of this possible relationship will be needed. altogether, the totality of the findings here suggest that genes expressed in reproductive tissues may be under greater translational level selection than those expressed in vegetative  tissues, a factor consistent with the key role of reproductive success in fitness.

protein length and gene expression
the analysis of protein lengths indicates that genes encoding shorter proteins tend to generally have greater bias in codon usage, as indicated by gc <dig>  for the species examined here  . this is consistent with the trends reported in other organisms to date such as arabidopsis, drosophila, c. elegans and yeast . we also found marked evidence that the gene expression level in the species studied here is inversely correlated to protein length for each of the six datasets examined , a result consistent with trends reported in humans, drosophila and populus tremula  <cit> . in particular, the pearson correlation coefficients were: z. mays male , z. mays female , t. aestivum male , t. aestivum female , b. napus male , and b. napus flower . this suggests that the tendency of shorter genes to have greater bias in codon usage , at least for the genes examined here, may be due to greater levels of gene expression and an associated selective pressure  <cit> . notably, in a complementary analysis to figure  <dig>  we found that the gender-bias in codon usage was evident among highly and among lowly expressed genes within each the three different protein length categories  .

thus, the gender-specific biases in z. mays and t. aestivum  at high and low levels of gene expression observed in figure  <dig> cannot be explained by differences in protein lengths. in addition to the inverse association between protein length and bias in codon usage, it is also evident from table  <dig> that the three species examined here tend to have different values for gc <dig>  with decreasingly lower values occurring from t. aestivum, to z. mays and to b. napus. altogether, it is evident from our entire analysis that the gender-specific effects on codon usage can be detected across a range of protein lengths, gene expression levels, and for different plant species, thereby demonstrating that gender-specific factors play a significant role in genome evolution.

notable issues
it should be noted that the b. napus material used for the microspore cdna library was grown at low temperatures  that could potentially alter some fraction of the gene expression in the microspore if stress-mediation genes were enhanced. in fact, we found less than 1% of the total genes in b. napus microspores were stress-related . another issue worth considering is the implication of previous findings of gender-specific mutation rates in plants, a trend that was based on the detection of higher evolutionary rates at silent sites, including third codon positions, in male gametes  <cit> . higher mutation rates in sperm, however, should act to enhance per generational mutation rates across the entire genome, including those genes expressed in females and in males, and thus, not impact the observed bias in codon usage.

nonetheless, it should be noted that the differential male/female inheritance of organelles , could influence whether these genes are expressed in male or female tissues/gametes, and potentially contribute to the codon usage for organellar genes and their substitution rates  <cit> ). it is also notable that the abundance of trna of the preferred codons could be greater for female than the male tissues/gametes and contribute to the gender differences in codon usage  <cit> . this seems relatively unlikely given that the abundance of trnas would have to be higher in female-tissues/gametes for every single preferred codon and that such differences have been shown not to explain the gender-specific codon usage in drosophila  <cit> . it should also be noted that the reproducibility of the results for gc <dig> and fpr observed in this study is consistent with the notion that gc <dig> content alone could be an effective indicator of codon bias in some species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports findings of female-specific bias in codon usage in plants. the remarkable consistency of the increased gc content of third codon positions and the increased frequency of preferred codons for both z. mays and t. aestivum, even across different gene expression levels and protein lengths, combined with the enhanced usage of species-specific preferred codons for each of the  <dig> amino acids having synonymous codons, strongly indicate that gender plays a key role in codon usage. the findings in b. napus suggest that the tissues of the reproductive system, including both male and female organs, have a greater impact on codon usage than somatic regions. overall, it is apparent that gender needs to be a key player in furthering our understanding of translational level selection. further study will be needed to ascertain whether this is a generalized phenomenon, inherent to other organisms, as it could play a key role in dna and protein sequence changes relevant to epidemiology, population genetics and to molecular evolution.
