BACKGROUND
toxicogenomic evaluations by microarrays have been invaluable in elucidating underlying mechanisms of toxicity  <cit> , investigating species-specific responses and ligand potencies  <cit> , and linking differential gene expression to apical endpoints  <cit> . however, the emergence of next-generation-sequencing  with its direct transcript identification, lower cost, larger dynamic range and superior detection of low abundance genes  <cit> , is making microarrays obsolete. despite these advantages, some studies have raised concerns regarding rna-seq and microarray comparability  <cit> . probe design and differences in platform sensitivity have been offered as potential explanations, although normalization and analysis methods also contribute to low concordance  <cit> .

analysis approaches have been developed specifically for rna-seq  <cit> , yet repurposed microarray normalization, statistical analysis, and deg identification methods outperform several rna-seq specific analysis tools  <cit> . consequently, we investigated the use of our semi-parametric normalization  <cit>  and empirical bayes analysis approach  <cit> , traditionally used for microarrays. semi-parametric normalization accounts for multiple sources of variation including random effects  <cit>  while empirical bayes analysis has the advantage of considering continuous variables such as the correlation between doses that can improve deg detection  <cit> , an important consideration in regulatory decision-making.

while microarray data submissions are encouraged by regulatory agencies and widely accepted in toxicogenomic research  <cit> , the third phase of the microarray quality control project  recommended further validation using different study designs  <cit> . to date, study designs involving chemical treatment have been limited to single dose studies  <cit> , the impact of different normalization approaches, or dose–response rna-seq studies with a sequencing depth of only 5 m reads  <cit> . collectively, these studies reported comparable responses between platforms, but were mixed in the ability of rna-seq to reveal the biological relevance of responses.

 <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  is a persistent environmental contaminant that binds to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  which then translocates to the nucleus and dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator   <cit> . the tcdd-ahr-arnt complex then binds to regulatory regions and elicits changes in global gene expression using dioxin response element -dependent  <cit> , and -independent mechanisms  <cit> . dose-and time-dependent tcdd elicited differential gene expression has been evaluated using microarrays after a single dose  <cit> . in this study, we extend these results by examining the effects of continuous tcdd exposure. dose-dependent hepatic differential gene expression in mice following oral gavage with tcdd every 4 days for 28 days was compared using rna-seq and agilent oligonucleotide microarrays analyzed using same the same normalization and empirical bayes analysis.

overall, rna-seq and agilent generated comparable results. quantitatively, rna-seq detected more genes expressed in the liver, and identified more differentially expressed genes  compared to agilent. qualitatively, direct sequencing by rna-seq provided more accurate transcript identification. verification by wafergen smartchip qrtpcr indicates rna-seq had fewer false-positives and false-negatives compared to agilent. dose response modeling was also consistent between both platforms, but the ability of rna-seq to detect low abundance transcripts and its larger dynamic range provided superior qualitative and quantitative data for deg identification, and estimates of point of departure  and ed <dig> 

RESULTS
quantitative rna-seq advantages
genome-wide hepatic gene expression was examined using ngs sequencing and agilent 4× <dig> k oligonucleotide microarrays using the same rna samples. rna-seq was performed at an average read depth of 30 m resulting in ~21 m high quality reads per sample . reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome grcm <dig>  representing  <dig>  ensembl annotated genes. genes with greater than  <dig> aligned reads in any sample were considered “expressed” or “detected”. using this criteria ≥85% of expressed genes were present in all samples . in total,  <dig>  genes were found to be expressed in the mouse liver with a sample size of  <dig>  the number of genes expressed in the liver did not change appreciably between  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  biological replicates . conversely, agilent microarrays have  <dig>  predefined probes representing  <dig>  unique entrez annotated genes . a total of  <dig>  genes were “detected”  based on the median feature intensity being greater than the median background intensity as determined by genepix.figure  <dig> comparing rna-seq and agilent microarrays for detecting genes expressed in the liver and differentially expressed by tcdd.  rna-seq reads were aligned to mouse genome grcm <dig>  and subsampled to represent 3– <dig> independent biological replicates. the number of differentially expressed genes  was determined under varying |fold change| and p <dig> criteria.  microarray features were examined for degs under varying |fold change| and p <dig> criteria.  rna-seq and microarray detected genes  were examined for common and unique detected genes and degs.  distribution of log <dig>  and  p <dig> values  ≥ 0) in rna-seq  and agilent  datasets.



comparison of detected genes using three biological replicates identified  <dig>  genes which were detected either by rna-seq or microarray and annotated with corresponding entrez and ensembl gene ids . among the  <dig>  genes detected only by rna-seq,  <dig>  were represented on the microarray but not detected based on genepix’s signal to background ratio. similarly,  <dig>  genes of the  <dig>  detected by microarray only were not detected by rna-seq when using a count cut-off of greater than  <dig> aligned reads. however  <dig>  of these  <dig>  genes did have at least  <dig> read align in at least one sample while the remaining  <dig>  were not detected by rna-seq. in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes detected by rna-seq and microarrays, respectively, did not have corresponding entrez or ensembl annotation that largely represented predicted genes . most importantly, there were  <dig> genes not covered by the microarray highlighting the quantitative benefit of rna-seq’s open concept platform.

rna-seq dynamic range influences filtering criteria
contrary to previous comparative studies, we used the same semi-parametric normalization and empirical bayes analysis to identify degs in both rna-seq and microarray datasets. empirical bayes analysis allows the varying of fold change and posterior probability ) cut-offs to investigate the effects of filtering criteria on deg detection without violating parametric hypothesis testing assumptions.

the number of identified degs did not change appreciably between  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> biological replicates  with ~78%  identified in all three sample size subsets . the other ~22% were also expressed in the other datasets but did not meet the filtering criteria. relaxation of filtering criteria within the union increased the overlap to ~92%, and all of these genes exhibited a positive fold change and p <dig> value correlation . given the excellent correspondence of deg responses across all sample sizes, all subsequent analyses were performed using three independent biological replicates representing the same samples as the rna-seq analysis to facilitate fairer comparisons to the microarray data set which also used three biological replicates.figure  <dig> effect of the number of independent biological replicates on rna-seq analysis.  degs were identified using a |fold change| ≥  <dig>  and p1 ≥  <dig>  when examining  <dig> independent biological replicates or a subset of  <dig> or  <dig> replicates and compared for identified genes. correlation of gene expression fold changes and p <dig> values are illustrated comparing   <dig> and  <dig>    <dig> and  <dig>  and   <dig> and  <dig> biological replicates.



rna-seq data was found to be more sensitive to changes in the p <dig> filtering criteria. increasing the p <dig> cut-off from ≥ <dig>  to ≥ <dig>  while maintaining a |fold change| cut-off of ≥ <dig>  decreased the number of degs from  <dig>  to  <dig> whereas increasing the |fold change| cut-off from > <dig>  to > <dig>  decreased the number of degs from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . conversely, for the microarray analysis, increasing the |fold change| cut-off from > <dig>  to > <dig>  dramatically decreased the identification of degs from  <dig>  to  <dig> while increasing the p <dig> cut-off had a less dramatic effect  ≥ <dig>  compared to  <dig>  degs at |fold change| ≥  <dig> , p <dig> ≥ <dig> ) .

these differences in sensitivity to filtering criteria may be attributed to the larger dynamic range of rna-seq which exhibits a wider range of fold changes  and a more uniform distribution of p <dig>  values . consequently, a |fold change| ≥  <dig>  and p1 ≥  <dig>  were used for rna-seq while a |fold change| ≥  <dig>  and p1 ≥  <dig>  were used for microarray in all subsequent comparisons in this study.

comparison of rna-seq and agilent datasets
comparing rna-seq and agilent datasets identified  <dig>  genes commonly expressed in the liver . genes showing the strongest responses in both rna-seq and microarray datasets included the typical ahr responsive genes such as cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  nqo <dig>  and tiparp . cyp1a <dig> exhibited a 771- and 82-fold induction, while sult3a <dig> was repressed 100- and 25- fold by rna-seq and microarray analysis, respectively. the magnitude of the fold change at both extremes illustrate the difference in dynamic range between the two platforms.

within the  <dig>  common rna-seq and microarray genes,  <dig> and  <dig>  degs were identified, respectively . comparative analysis revealed that only  <dig> genes were common to both datasets  and that a similar overlap is observed for each dose independently . nevertheless, a majority of the  <dig>  genes detected by both platforms , the union of  <dig>  degs across both platforms , and the  <dig> degs common to both platforms  exhibited positive fold change and p <dig> value correlations, indicating a strong correlation between rna-seq and agilent. as seen with sample size, relaxing the cut-off criteria for the union of the rna-seq and microarray data sets increased the overlap suggesting differences were most likely due to genes approaching but not satisfying hard fold change and/or p <dig> cut-offs, despite evidence of differential expression.figure  <dig> comparison of rna-seq and agilent degs.  overlapping, rna-seq-specific and agilent-specific degs were identified. correlation of fold changes and p <dig> values were examined for  all  <dig>  expressed genes detected by both platforms,  the union of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes , and  the  <dig> degs detected by both platforms.



despite the overlap of only  <dig> genes, comparison of functional enrichment analyses identified degs associated with lipid binding, processing, and metabolism, oxidative stress, immune responses, cell adhesion and movement, and extracellular matrix remodeling within rna-seq and agilent data sets  consistent with previous reports  <cit> . additional analysis of genes unique to rna-seq also identified carbohydrate binding and extracellular matrix remodeling as enriched functions while unique microarray genes show lower enrichment of these functions .

rna-seq outperforms microarray deg identification
a subset of rna-seq and agilent responses were further investigated using wafergen smartchip real-time pcr. this included  <dig> negative controls ,  <dig> positive controls ,  <dig> rna-seq specific genes, and  <dig> agilent specific genes . the platform-specific genes included  <dig> exhibiting divergent responses . of the  <dig> genes validated, agilent identified  <dig> false negatives and  <dig> false positives for a false discovery rate  of 54% while rna-seq found  <dig> false-negatives and  <dig> false-positives for a fdr of 24% . overall, rna-seq outperformed agilent on sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, fdr, and false negative rate .figure  <dig> verification of rna-seq and agilent deg identification by wafergen smartchip real-time pcr analysis.  qrtpcr data  was used as the “gold standard” to determine true and false positives and negatives for rna-seq  and agilent  datasets.  performance metrics of rna-seq and agilent validated by qrtpcr.  representative example of a false-negative and  false-positive response in the rna-seq dataset. official gene symbols are indicated in upper left corner with the number of rna-seq aligned reads in parentheses () and number of samples with ct values lower than background in brackets  for vehicle control samples. bars represent mean fold-change determined by wafergen technology , the red line represents rnaseq fold-change, and the green line represents agilent fold change. significant differences within wafergen data were determined by one-way anova followed by dunnett’s post-hoc test and indicated by an asterisk  with the exception of fam83a whose undetectable levels prevented statistical testing. red  and green  dots represent p <dig>  values with size indicating level of significance . labels on the x-axis indicate the dose of tcdd , number of aligned rna-seq reads, and number of samples with ct values lower than background. dashed lines indicate  <dig>  and  <dig>  |fold-change| thresholds to identify degs.  ucsc genome browser track illustrating pcr primer and agilent probe alignments for zfp <dig>  the zfp <dig> loci is presented in blue with exons  and introns . the arrowheads indicate the direction of transcription.



further examination of false negatives/positives identified by rna-seq revealed that false negatives were largely due to failing to meet the filtering criteria, despite remarkably similar expression patterns across all three technologies . false positives typically included genes with low numbers of reads and, in most cases, changed expression from non-detectable to modest or vice-versa, suggesting they are in fact true positives .

agilent genes showing the most divergent expression compared to wafergen were disp <dig>  gabbr <dig>  heatr5a, wdr <dig>  zfp <dig>  and zfp <dig> , while sult2a <dig>  tlr <dig>  and uox were only identified as degs by rna-seq . overall, there was excellent agreement between rna-seq and wafergen with agilent exhibiting divergence. examination of agilent probes revealed disp <dig> and tlr <dig> did not match their intended target, whereas heat5ra and wdr <dig> exhibited different responses depending on the agilent probes querying different gene regions. however, the agilent probe sequence and wafergen primers for zfp <dig> queried adjacent regions suggesting non-specific hybridization . therefore, in addition to artifactual platform specific differential gene expression due to hard cut-off criteria, discrepancies between rna-seq and agilent can also be attributed to differences in sensitivity and probe designs that query different regions, have no known target  and/or are susceptible to cross-hybridization.

rna-seq versus agilent dose response analysis
dose–response modeling is critical in regulatory decision-making. consequently, point of departure  estimates for the benchmark dose  and the benchmark dose limit ; lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval on the bmd) were determined using bmdexpress  <cit> . bmdexpress fit  <dig> of  <dig>  rna-seq degs with dose response curves compared to  <dig> of  <dig>  agilent degs . within the  <dig> degs common to both technologies,  <dig>  were fitted with dose–response curves. platform difference in dynamic range and ability to detect low abundant transcripts influenced pod estimates. for example, at low bmd estimates, agilent values were higher compared to rna-seq due to poorer resolution at low expression levels. at higher bmd estimates rna-seq values were higher, likely due to microarray signal compression . nevertheless, pod estimates and rank were strongly correlated between both technologies . moreover, pod estimates were not influenced by sample size .figure  <dig> comparison of rna-seq and agilent dose–response modeling.  the toxresponse modeler  <cit>  was used to identify genes fitting a sigmoidal response for the estimation of ed50s while  bmdexpress  <cit>  was used to find the best fit curves for point of departure  estimates. correlation of  ed50s and  bmd  and bmdl  estimates were examined for all comparable genes.



for ed <dig> estimates,  <dig> of  <dig>  rna-seq degs exhibited a sigmoidal dose response as determined by the toxresponse modeler  <cit>  while  <dig>  of  <dig>  agilent degs exhibited a sigmoidal dose response with  <dig> in common between both platforms . correlation of the ed50s , found agilent ed50s to be higher compared to rna-seq at low estimates. in contrast, rna-seq ed50s were higher at higher estimates . the lower slope  is consistent with microarray signal compression and poorer ability to detect low abundance transcripts.

discussion
whole genome gene expression analysis provides comprehensive data on potential mechanisms of action as well as product safety  <cit> . as regulatory agencies and researchers struggle to incorporate omic data into decision-making and research applications, the technology continues to evolve requiring the verification of reproducibility, reliability, and continuity  <cit> . hybridization-based platforms such as affymetrix genechips and agilent oligonucleotide microarrays are being replaced by ngs technologies such as rna-seq. although several studies have reported comparable technical reproducibility, variance structure, absolute expression, and deg identification capabilities using different study designs and model systems  <cit> , only one has investigated dose response  <cit> , the corner stone of risk/safety assessment. our study complements and extends previous comparisons by evaluating the dose-dependent hepatic changes in gene expression using rna-seq and agilent 4× <dig> k oligonucleotide microarrays. we used the same normalization and analysis methods to minimize bias while further investigating the cause of qualitative and quantitative differences between rna-seq and agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. in comparison to wafergen smartchip qrtpcr, we demonstrate that some differences between rna-seq and agilent deg identification may not be as significant as previously reported.

degs were identified using an adapted semi-parametric normalization approach followed by an empirical bayes method that used model-based t values to calculate posterior probability p <dig> values on a per gene and dose basis  <cit> . bayes models take into account adjacent points to consider trends within time course and dose response data sets. therefore, p <dig> values do not test hypotheses, and can be used to rank and prioritize degs based on their probability of differential expression. this allows cut-off criteria to be varied in order to include well characterized responsive genes and mechanistic significance in the context of observed phenotypes, without violating any assumptions. in our study, varying the cut-off criteria demonstrated that rna-seq was particularly sensitive to p <dig> changes likely due to its much larger dynamic range compared to microarrays .

the influence of sample size on deg identification has not been adequately investigated. power analyses suggest sample sizes of 3– <dig> depending on sequencing depth and budget  <cit>  while others have examined  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> replicates using synthetic datasets and various analysis approaches  <cit> . we identified comparable numbers of degs when using  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> independent replicates at a sequencing depth of 30 m . moreover, there was a strong correlation across all sample sizes indicating rna-seq responses were not significantly influenced by the sample size , facilitating cross-technology comparisons using a sample size of  <dig> in this study.

overall, rna-seq detected more genes expressed in the liver . many of the genes only detected on agilent microarrays could also be identified within the rna-seq dataset by lowering the number of reads threshold . similarly, most degs identified only on agilent microarrays could also be detected in the rna-seq dataset by lowering the selection criteria, particularly the p <dig> cut-off. comparing rna-seq and agilent datasets for degs identified a 35% – 50% overlap , similar to previous reports  <cit> . wafergen qrtpcr, rna-seq and agilent dose response curves were remarkably similar for many genes classified as either rna-seq- or agilent-specific  suggesting that differences between platforms were due more to selection criteria as opposed to differences in expression. consequently, rna-seq quantitatively outperformed agilent microarrays when identifying the total number of genes expressed in the liver, and differentially expressed by tcdd . in addition, rna-seq provided more definitive qualitative data regarding the identity of the gene that the transcript represented and identified more genes involved in pathways known to be affected by tcdd. previous studies suggest rna-seq performance was mixed for detecting the differential expression of low expressed genes  <cit> . however, detection of low abundance genes improves dramatically at ~30 m reads  <cit> , the sequencing depth used in this study.

further analysis of genes exhibiting divergent expression  identified two principal contributing factors. first, some agilent probes were misannotated and did not target the expected gene possibly due to outdated annotation provided by manufacturer, but nevertheless, requiring re-evaluation and re-annotation. second, multiple probes for the same gene also showed divergent responses indicating either non-specific binding  or the presence of variant transcripts that targeted individual probes. rna-seq analysis mitigates these disadvantages by using the most recent genome build available and its associated annotation, while providing the opportunity to identify treatment-specific transcript variants.

risk assessments typically involve four components: hazard identification, dose response characterization, exposure assessment and risk characterization. omic technologies are expected to improve risk assessment by providing more qualitative and quantitative data. this includes the use of gene expression profile or fingerprint classifiers that not only identify comparable modes/mechanisms of action in hazard identification, but could also justify the use of refined uncertainty factors for extrapolation between species. in addition, rna-seq provides a greater number of responsive genes that can be functionally annotated, associated with a key event, and modeled for ed <dig> values and point of departure  estimates such as bmd and bmd. despite the challenges of incorporating omic data into risk assessment, the goal is to provide data that complements existing testing guidelines and requirements to support a more quantitative, mechanistically-based risk assessment.

rna-seq and agilent datasets were analyzed for tcdd-elicited dose-dependent gene expression using toxresponse modeler and bmdexpress. although only a small subset of genes exhibited dose-dependent responses in both technologies , the correspondence between both was strong. overall, rna-seq pod and ed <dig> values were considered to be more accurate due to its ability to detect lower abundance genes and greater dynamic range . data compression and lower sensitivity also affects the slope of the dose response curve which may confound interpretation of receptor interaction mechanisms and cross-ligand comparisons used to determine toxic equivalency factor  estimates for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins , dibenzofurans , and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq exhibited superior qualitative and quantitative performance compared to agilent microarrays. our results are not only consistent with most, if not all, previous comparative studies  <cit> , but also provide additional complementary dose response evidence in a mouse model. furthermore, differences between rna-seq and agilent differential gene expression are largely due to filtering criteria and gene annotation, not differences in patterns of expression. although some results between the platforms are comparable, accumulating evidence supports the use of rna-seq over microarrays for dose response studies.
