BACKGROUND
during the last years, the number of human infections caused by opportunistic pathogens has increased dramatically. one natural reservoir of opportunistic pathogens is the rhizosphere, the zone around roots that is influenced by the plant  <cit> . due to a high content of nutrients, this habitat is a ‘microbial hot-spot’, where bacterial abundances including those with strong antagonistic traits are enhanced  <cit> . various bacterial genera, including burkholderia, enterobacter, herbaspirillum, ochrobactrum, pseudomonas, ralstonia, staphylococcus and stenotrophomonas, contain root-associated strains that can encounter bivalent interactions with both plant and human hosts  <cit> . mechanisms responsible for colonization of the rhizosphere and antagonistic activity against plant pathogens are similar to those responsible for colonization of human organs and tissues, and pathogenicity  <cit> . multiple resistances against antibiotics are not only found with clinical strains but also with strains isolated from the rhizosphere  <cit> . high competition, the occurrence of diverse antibiotics and secondary antimicrobial plant metabolites, and enhanced horizontal gene transfer and mutation rates in this microenvironment contribute to the high levels of natural resistances  <cit> . on the other hand, rhizosphere inhabitants have an enormous potential as biocontrol or stress protecting agents or as fertilizers for sustainable agriculture  <cit> .

stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging global pathogen and already one of the most common opportunistic pathogens in hospitals  <cit> . a recent study shows that approx. 5% of the gram-negative infections were caused by s. maltophilia in intensive care units in the united states. the two most common diseases caused by s. maltophilia are bacteremia and pneumonia, which are often associated with high mortality rates. s. maltophilia strains are characterized by multi-resistance to many antibiotics  <cit> . for a long time it was not possible to differentiate between the clinical and environmental s. maltophilia strains  <cit> . using a polyphasic approach, wolf et al.  <cit>  were able to describe a new plant-associated species within the s. maltophilia complex. interestingly, no human-pathogenic potential has ever been observed in this phylogenetically and ecologically closely related species  <cit> . moreover, both species can be easily distinguished with regard to the production of the osmoprotective substance glucosylglycerol  and the occurrence of specific multidrug-efflux pumps   <cit> . s. rhizophila is both rhizosphere- and phylloplane- competent and shows pronounced salt tolerance, and is hence a model bacterium among the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria   <cit> . plant growth promotion by s. rhizophila strain dsm14405t  was observed under greenhouse conditions  <cit>  and in the highly salinated soils of uzbekistan at levels up to 180%  <cit> . however, s. maltophilia was a typical rhizosphere bacterium used as an efficient biocontrol agent, and until the 1980s, no capacity to cause infection had ever been reported. now, the theory is established that the ancestors of virulent bacteria including stenotrophomonas, as well as the origin of virulence and resistance determinants, lay most likely in the environmental microbiota  <cit> . it is now one of the main challenges to predict any risk for human health  <cit> . currently, these potential risk factors are a main obstacle in registration procedures, especially in the european union  <cit> . next generation sequencing and the corresponding bioinformatic analyses have an enormous impact on our understanding of microbial communities and the host-microbe interactions  <cit> . however, is it possible to use these techniques to solve this problem?

the objective of our study was to find out if there is a borderline based on the distinguishing features between the beneficials and pathogens within the genus stenotrophomonas. moreover, using genomics, transcriptomics and physiological assays, we try to predict the potential risk of the stress protecting agent s. rhizophila strain dsm14405t for humans by studying its genetic potentials and comparing these with two stenotrophomonas model strains, the human-pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a  <cit>  and the plant-associated s. maltophilia r551- <dig>  <cit> .

specific gene characteristics of s. rhizophiladsm14405twithin the stenotrophomonas/xanthomonasgroup
quorum sensing
similar to various xanthomonads, s. rhizophila dsm14405t does not possess a homoserine lactone-based quorum sensing system, but instead uses the rpf/dsf system for quorum sensing and cell-cell communication. the rpf  gene cluster is responsible for the synthesis and perception of the dsf molecule which is a quorum sensing regulatory molecule of fatty acid nature with similarity to enoyl-coa hydratase, and was first detected in xanthomonas  <cit> . the rpff gene product, known as dsf synthase, is essential for the synthesis of dsf  <cit> . other members of the rpf gene locus  have been revealed to each fulfill a particular function, with the rpfc/rpfg two-component system consisting of a sensory  and regulatory  component that are responsible for dsf perception and signal transduction, respectively  <cit> .

similar to stenotrophomonas strains k279a and r551- <dig>  the core of the rpf gene locus of s. rhizophila dsm14405t consists of four genes: rpfb, rpff, rpfc and rpfg. fouhy et al.  <cit>  described the positions of these in the human-pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a, which we found to be similar to those in the plant-associated s. maltophilia r551- <dig>  moreover, in both k279a and r551- <dig>  rpfb and rpff are located on the lagging strand while rpfc and rpfg are located on the leading strand. in s. rhizophila dsm14405t, however, the rpfb and rpff genes are located on the leading strand while rpfc and rpfg are on the lagging strand. in addition, in the genome of s. rhizophila, there is a 228-nucleotide gene of unknown function on the lagging strand between rpff and rpfb, which extends from  <dig> to  <dig> and was annotated as sr <dig> dx03_ <dig>  in addition, sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> is transcribed in the cell, as we detected the corresponding mrna in a whole genome expression analysis approach . there is no homologue to sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> in either s. maltophilia r551- <dig> or k279a, and its function in s. rhizophila dsm14405t remains to be elucidated.

flagella, fimbriae
flagella and fimbriae-driven motility is crucial for biofilm formation and host-plant colonization by bacteria . s. rhizophila dsm14405t possesses several genes responsible for motility. a gene block encoding a flagellar apparatus was detected that includes  <dig> genes, and extends over the genome from sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig> with most genes located on the leading strand. another flagella-encoding gene block was also detected which includes  <dig> genes and is located between sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> and dx03_ <dig>  furthermore, two putative fimbriae gene clusters, sr <dig> dx03_04025-dx03_ <dig> and sr <dig> dx03_04075-dx03_ <dig>  were detected; other fimbriae-coding genes are scattered throughout the genome.

chitinase, extracellular proteases, antibiotic and salinity resistance
s. rhizophila dsm14405t is a biocontrol agent capable of synthesizing extracellular enzymes with anti-pathogenic activity such as chitinase and extracellular proteases, and is antagonistic against important fungal pathogens such as verticillium dahliae and rhizoctonia solani  <cit> . in addition to its direct effect, s. rhizophila dsm14405t is thought to also indirectly promote plant growth through biological control  <cit> . in the genome, sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> codes for a putative extracellular chitinase gene, and sr14405s dx03_ <dig>  dx03_ <dig>  dx03_ <dig>  dx03_ <dig> are predicted to code for extracellular proteases.

in general, stenotrophomonas species are known to show resistance against a broad range of antibiotics  <cit> . there are numerous resistance genes against various antibiotics in the genome of s. rhizophila dsm14405t, some code for general resistance, while others provide resistance against particular classes of antibiotics. the gene cluster extending from sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig> was predicted to code for a multidrug export system. another two multidrug resistance gene clusters were detected from sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig> and from dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig>  a number of single multidrug resistance genes, such as mdtn, mdta and sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> are scattered throughout the genome as well. moreover, maca and macb code for the macrolide-specific efflux protein and a macrolide export atp-binding/permease, respectively. other identified genes include: sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> and amph that code for β-lactamases, sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> that codes for an aminoglycoside efflux pump, and a transposon tetracycline resistance gene .

s. rhizophila dsm14405t possesses both ggps and ycad, which are essential for the synthesis and transport of the important osmolyte glucosylglycerol, which provides tolerance against salinity and salt stress  <cit> . both ggps and ycad are absent in s. maltophilia r551- <dig> and k279a.

surface polysaccharides
homologs to xana, xanb, and rmlac were detected in s. rhizophila dsm14405t. these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the xanthomonas well-known surface polysaccharide xanthan, in biofilm formation  <cit>  and the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides. it is noteworthy that s. rhizophila dsm14405t, similar to other members of the stenotrophomonas species known so far, does not have a gum gene cluster and therefore cannot produce xanthan.

the bacterial capsule is an extracellular structure usually composed of polysaccharides which is considered an important virulence factor in surface adherence, antibiotic resistance, and preventing phagocytosis  <cit> . reckseidler et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the ability to synthesize capsule is crucial for virulence in the human pathogenic burkholderia. in s. rhizophila dsm14405t, a gene block from sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig> is homologous to a capsule biosynthesis gene cluster of pseudomonas pseudomallei, described by  <cit> . this gene block includes genes that code for proteins of various functions such as signal transduction, transport, and biosynthesis of capsule polysaccharide components. none of the genes present in the s. rhizophila capsule gene block were detected in s. maltophilia r551- <dig> and k279a.

alginate, an exopolysaccharide, is involved in the development and architecture of biofilms and protects bacteria from antibiotics and other antibacterial mechanisms . alginate biosynthesis genes algi and algj code for the poly  o-acetylase and the alginate biosynthesis protein, respectively. while both were detected in s. rhizophila dsm14405t, neither the plant-associated strain s. maltophilia r551- <dig> nor the human pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a contained either of these genes. algi is preceded by four genes which are also absent from both s. maltophilia r551- <dig> and k279a, with one of these being homologous to a gene coding for a cell morphology protein from the biocontrol agent p. fluorescens sbw <dig> 

secretion systems
while type ii and v secretion system genes were identified in s. rhizophila dsm14405t, there is no type iii secretion system present, as this is typical of stenotrophomonas. although there are several genes belonging to the type iv secretion system, a complete gene set was not detected in s. rhizophila dsm14405t. furthermore, a gene block extending from sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig> was identified in s. rhizophila, which includes numerous genes of the type vi secretion system  including icmf, impa, genes belonging to the hcp <dig> family, and genes coding for proteins with a t6ss rhs element. with the exception of sr <dig> dx03_ <dig>  dx03_ <dig>  and dx03_ <dig>  there were no homologs in s. maltophilia k279a and r551- <dig> to any of the genes of the s. rhizophila type vi secretion system block.

one genus, two entirely different habitats and life styles? : genome comparison between s. rhizophiladsm14405tand s. maltophiliak279a
all genes of the plant growth-promoting environmental s. rhizophila dsm14405t and the clinical human pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a were compared. while absent from s. maltophilia k279a, numerous s. rhizophila-specific genes play a role in host-plant colonization. some of these genes, as described earlier, are crucial for surface attachment, biofilm formation, secretion systems-driven molecular mechanisms, and tolerance of environmental stress such as high soil salinity. in addition, another s. rhizophila-specific gene was predicted to code for spermidine synthase . spermidine is a plant growth regulator and has been recently shown to strongly promote the growth of arugula plants  <cit> . there are also s. rhizophila-specific genes that are predicted to be involved in the biodegradation of bacterial and plant cell wall. mltd, located closely to the s. rhizophila type vi secretion system gene block, codes for muramidase that plays an important role in the bacterial cell wall breakdown. furthermore, a gene block stretching from sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> to dx03_ <dig> was predicted to code for several genes involved in the breakdown of plant cell walls.

as a next step, the s. rhizophila dsm14405t having a counterpart in the plant-associated s. maltophilia r551- <dig>  but with no homologous genes in the clinical s. maltophilia k279a were studied. of these  <dig> genes, several help with the need to adapt to the plant and rhizosphere as the natural habitat. for instance, the endo- <dig> -beta-xylanase b gene  is involved in plant cell wall biodegradation. other genes conserved in s. rhizophila dsm14405t and s. maltophilia r551- <dig> are the ferrichrome receptor genes, fcua and fhua which code for siderophore receptors, and the outer membrane adhesin-like gene . table  <dig> presents a list of selected s. rhizophila dsm14405t–specific genes with no homologs in the human pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a, together with their biological role. the complete list of the 884 s. rhizophila dsm14405t-specific genes which are not present in s. maltophilia k279a is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> table  <dig>

next, the genomes of s. rhizophila dsm14405t and s. maltophilia k279a were compared using the latter as the reference, which revealed that  <dig> genes are specific to the human pathogenic k279a with no homologs in the plant-growth promoting s. rhizophila. while many of these genes are hypothetical or have unknown protein function, others play a specific role. of the genes with a known or predicted function, many are involved in pathogenicity and virulence. for example, the gene block extending from smlt  <dig> to  <dig> codes for proteins of the type iv secretion system, which is known to have a dual role of both horizontal gene transfer and pathogenicity. other s. maltophilia k279a-specific virulence genes are smlt  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which were predicted to code for an outer membrane-located adhesin, hemolysin, and hemagluttinin, respectively. furthermore, smlt  <dig>  and afad code for putative exopolysaccharide and adhesin, respectively. in addition, a k279a-specific putative fimbriae gene block  codes for fimbrial adhesin proteins and their chaperones. moreover, there are also several s. maltophilia k279a heat shock and chaperone-encoding genes that have no homologs in s. rhizophila dsm14405t, such as smlt  <dig> and smlt 4629– <dig>  as both code for heat shock chaperone proteins. synthesis of chaperones to cope with temperature-caused stress is fundamental for the natural habitat of s. maltophilia k279a as a human pathogenic strain. there are various s. maltophilia k279a-specific genes coding for antibiotic resistance and multidrug efflux pumps that are absent from s. rhizophila dsm14405t. for instance, smeabc , which code for a multidrug efflux pump typical of s. maltophilia strains, is not present in dsm14405t. nevertheless in total, six of the nine k279a genes that code for multidrug efflux pumps involved in antibiotic resistance  <cit>  have a homolog in s. rhizophila dsm14405t. other s. maltophilia k279a-specific genes with respect to antibiotic resistance include β-lactamase genes, smlt  <dig> and  <dig>  and smlt  <dig> , which codes for a fluoroquinolone resistance protein. moreover, several heavy metal resistance genes for the transport of arsenate, mercuric, and copper are another genomic characteristic of the human pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a. table  <dig> shows various s. maltophilia k279a genes with no homologs in the plant growth-promoting s. rhizophila dsm14405t together with their products and biological roles. the complete list of the 1230 s. maltophilia k279a-specific genes is presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  figure  <dig> represents a model that summarizes crucial specific mechanisms harnessed by s. rhizophila dsm14405t and s. maltophilia k279a to best adapt to their particular habitats together with the corresponding genes, and the important mechanisms that are shared between both species.table  <dig>

the temperature limit: the transcriptional response of s. rhizophiladsm14405tto 35°c
in contrast to other stenotrophomonas strains including s. maltophilia k279a and r551- <dig>  s. rhizophila dsm14405t is not able to grow at 37°c, which is a critical temperature for strains to colonize the human body. to understand why this strain and other s. rhizophila strains cannot grow at this temperature and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms behind, the impact of high temperature  on s. rhizophila dsm14405t was studied using a transcriptomic approach. in comparison with growth at 30°c,  <dig> and  <dig> genes are significantly up and down-regulated, respectively, as the result of a severe heat shock of 35°c . as presented, genes responsible for translation and post-translational modification along with other functional gene groups including those involved in the metabolism and transport of amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and the production and conversion of energy are up-regulated at 35°c. moreover, those genes whose functions are only generally known are also mostly up-regulated suggesting that, in s. rhizophila dsm14405t, a significant number of the genes involved in the response to severe heat shock code for proteins with unknown function. in contrast, genes responsible for cell motility, secretion and intracellular trafficking show a pronounced down-regulation at 35°c, making up  <dig> % of all down-regulated genes. of the genes with a significant transcription fold change as the result of the shift from  <dig> to 35°c, some code for products with known biological function . as shown in the table, genes coding for chaperones involved in both general stress and heat shock specific response including dnaj-k, and gros-l and htpg, respectively, are up-regulated at 35°c. other up-regulated genes include rpoh which codes for the heat shock specific sigma factor, and numerous genes coding for proteases that are responsible for the degradation of stress-denatured proteins. furthermore, genes responsible for cell suicide mechanisms, sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> and dx03_ <dig>  are also up-regulated as the result of the shift from  <dig> to 35°c. in contrast, as shown in table  <dig> genes coding for pili-driven cell motility are negatively affected at 35°c.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present work, we characterized the genomic features of the plant growth promoting and biocontrol agent s. rhizophila dsm14405t. in addition, the comparison between the genome of s. rhizophila with other environmental and clinical stenotrophomonas model strains, s. maltophilia r551- <dig> and k279a, respectively revealed a great deal of homology shared among all three bacteria. surprisingly, the comparison of s. rhizophila’s genes with either of the other two strains showed that the total number of genes shared between s. rhizophila and the human-pathogenic s. maltophilia k279a is only slightly less than the total gene number shared with the plant-associated beneficial s. maltophilia r551- <dig> strain. given this significant degree of similarity, we concluded that the immense difference between s. rhizophila and s. maltophilia k279a with regard to the habitat and lifestyle must be based upon the role of those genes that are specific to either of the strains and absent from the other. on this account, a number of s. rhizophila specific genes coding for products of known function were detected and classified according to their biological roles. these include genes involved in plant growth promotion, plant cell wall degradation, biofilm formation, resistance against salinity and the type vi secretion system .

clearly as an environmental plant-associated strain, s. rhizophila faces particular habitat-specific factors such as those that impose some sort of osmotic stress on the cell including root exudates and salinity. in a study published recently, we used a transcriptomic approach to study the manner of response of s. rhizophila dsm14405t to osmotic stress  <cit> . surprisingly, the combination of both the genomic and transcriptomic data reveals that a significant number of the genes with known biological role that are greatly involved in osmotic stress protection including cbg <dig>  xynb, ggps, ycad, algj and the t6ss are specific to s. rhizophila and absent from s. maltophilia k279a. this finding confirms the importance of the strain specific genes in the adaptation and performance of s. rhizophila in its natural habitat. as a clinical human-pathogenic strain, s. maltophilia k279a also possesses particular genetic potentials that make possible its lifestyle . the role of type iv secretion system, hemolysin and other adherence components in virulence and pathogenicity was described earlier. a yet more crucial feature of s. maltophilia k279a with regard to performance in its habitat, however, is perhaps its ability to grow at 37°c. also in this regard, this strain possesses specific heat shock resistance genes that are absent from s. rhizophila.

as mentioned earlier, s. rhizophila dsm14405t is not able to grow at 37°c. to understand the manner of response of s. rhizophila to severe growth-inhibiting temperature, a genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed at 35°c using transcriptomics. the positive impact of the growth temperature at 35°c compared to 30°c on several functional gene groups including those responsible for the metabolism and transport of amino acids, lipids and the energy providing genes is due to the heat stress that the cell is coping with. furthermore, studying the expression of single genes revealed that those genes coding for general and heat shock specific chaperones, various proteases that break down stress-denatured, abnormal proteins are up-regulated. for example at 35°c, the primary general stress sigma factor  <dig> coding gene, which is strongly expressed at an earlier stage under cell stress, and initiates the expression of rpoh , specific chaperones  and protease coding genes  is down-regulated while rpoh, and other response mechanisms show up-regulation. this confirms an advanced state of shock for s. rhizophila at 35°c, at which heat shock specific response mechanisms are strongly activated. in this regard, the up-regulation of sr <dig> dx03_ <dig> and dx03_ <dig>  which code for toxin/antidote-based suicide systems further illustrate the mechanisms used by s. rhizophila dsm14405t to respond to the severe heat stress. moreover, reduced cell motility, which is also part of these response mechanisms, is presumably due to the fact that costly processes such as motility are to be minimized during harsh stress times.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, there is a great deal of similarity between the beneficial and human-pathogenic stenotrophomonas model strains. nevertheless, the adaptation to the habitat and lifestyle to guarantee the survival of the species is cared for by mechanisms specific to either of the groups, and many genes underlying these mechanisms in s. rhizophila dsm14405t are strain-specific. furthermore according to the genomic and transcriptomic analyses together with its physiological characteristics, s. rhizophila poses no threat to human health and could hence be safely applied in biotechnology.
