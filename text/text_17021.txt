BACKGROUND
the characteristic toxins of poisonous agarics  in the genus amanita include the amatoxins such as α-amanitin and the phallotoxins such as phalloidin. both families of toxins are bicyclic peptides biosynthesized on ribosomes as precursor peptides  <cit> . these were the first ribosomally encoded post-translationally modified peptides  to be described from the kingdom mycota  <cit> . additional fungal ripps have subsequently been discovered in filamentous fungi  .

from a partial genomic sequence obtained by  <dig> pyrosequencing, it was shown that the genes for α-amanitin and phallacidin belong to a family of at least  <dig> genes in amanita bisporigera  called the “msdin” family for the first five conserved amino acids in the precursor peptides  <cit> . the msdin precursor peptides are 33– <dig> amino acids in length and comprise two conserved regions, a 10-amino acid “leader” and a 17-amino acid “follower”, flanking a highly variable “core” region of 6– <dig> amino acids that contains the amino acids present in the mature toxins.

subsequent to its discovery in ab, the msdin family has been found in other cyclic peptide toxin-producing species of amanita, including a. ocreata, a. phalloides , and a. exitialis  <cit> . the msdin family is absent from fungi that do not produce amatoxins or phallotoxins, including species of amanita outside section phalloideae  <cit> . galerina marginata , an agaric not closely related to amanita, also produces α-amanitin on ribosomes but does not possess an extended gene family  <cit> . the α-amanitin gene in gm is the same length  as the homolog in ab, but its primary amino acid sequence is divergent outside the core region  <cit> .

the initial post-translational processing step of the α-amanitin precursor peptide in gm is catalyzed by gmpopb, a specialized member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases  <cit> . popb first cleaves at the carboxy side of a highly conserved pro residue at the c-terminus of the 10-amino acid leader sequence and then transpeptidates at a second pro  to produce a homodetic cyclic octapeptide. studies with synthetic peptides have elucidated the general sequence and structural requirements of the precursor peptide for processing by popb  <cit> . a dedicated pop most likely also processes the cyclic peptide precursor peptides in amanita  <cit> .

in order to more fully understand the genomic potential for cyclic peptide production by amanita section phalloideae, we have generated draft genome sequences of ap and ab. we show that each species contains ~ <dig> members of the msdin family, only three of which are in common between the two fungi. furthermore, two specimens within the a. bisporigera species complex have different complements of msdin genes. these results illuminate the deep genetic potential of the amanita toxin biosynthetic pathway to produce a range of modified and unmodified cyclic peptides by the same biosynthetic pathway.

RESULTS
genome and transcriptome assembly of ap and ab
the sequencing and assembly statistics for the genomes for ap and ab are shown in table  <dig>  after an initial assembly of the ap genome, blobology analysis identified  <dig> contigs that were contaminated with non-fungal reads  <cit> . the raw reads associated with the contaminated contigs were removed before reassembling the genome. the genome assembly of ap contained  <dig> contigs greater than 1 kb and a total size of ~40 mb with an n <dig> scaffold size of 54 kb. using a basidiomycete single-copy core protein database, analysis with busco  <cit>  resulted in the identification of 92% complete and  <dig> % fragmented protein sequences in the ap genome assembly. only  <dig> % of the core basidiomycete core proteins were missing.table  <dig> basic statistics for the genome assemblies

for ab, analysis of an initial genome assembly with blobology indicated that  <dig> contigs were contaminated with non-fungal sequences. raw reads aligned to these sites of contamination were removed, and the remaining reads were reassembled. the final ab genome assembly had a total size of ~75 mb with  <dig>  scaffolds with an n <dig> scaffold size of  <dig>  kb . the genome contained 73% of the complete proteins in the busco basidiomycete single-copy core protein dataset,  <dig> % of fragmented proteins, and was missing 17% of the core proteins. transcript assembly of ab rna-seq reads with trinity yielded  <dig>  transcripts, including isoforms.

maker annotation of ap and ab genomes
the annotation of ap resulted in  <dig>  gene models of which  <dig> were supported by protein alignments and/or known pfam domains   <cit> . these gene models were used as the high-quality gene set for functional annotation and downstream ortholog analysis. the average predicted transcript length was 1494 bp, with a unimodal gc distribution ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> with a peak at  <dig> .

the annotation of ab resulted in  <dig>  gene models of which  <dig>  were supported by transcript alignments, protein alignments, and/or known pfam domains . this set of  <dig>  gene models was retained as the high-quality gene set for functional annotation and downsteam ortholog analysis. the average transcript length was 1182 bp, with a unimodal gc distribution ranging from 17– <dig> with a peak at  <dig> .

msdin gene search and annotation
no msdin genes were annotated by the maker annotation pipeline even after the minimum protein length parameter was reduced to 150 bp. we also trained snap and augustus to find short genes by using only short genes in the training sets, but this also resulted in no msdin gene predictions . finally, by using known members of the msdin family as tblastn queries,  <dig> msdin genes were manually identified in ap, of which  <dig> were unique . the predicted proteins of  <dig> of them started with the canonical sequence “msdin”, and the others with some single amino-acid variant of msdin, i.e., msdmn, msdvn, msdik, msein, msdtn or msnin. all had the two canonical pro residues required for processing by prolyl oligopeptidase b , except one predicted protein  was missing the pro residue immediately upstream of the variable region and another  was missing the second pro residue  <cit> . the latter precursor peptide sequence also lacked the terminal cys residue that is probably required for processing by popb  <cit> . among the ap msdin genes were three  encoding phalloidin  from three separate scaffolds. two genes  encoded β-amanitin . there were single genes for phallacidin and α-amanitin . the apha_msdin_ <dig> gene encoded cycloamanide b, which is an unmodified monocyclic heptapeptide of sequence sfffpip  <cit> .table  <dig> predicted peptide sequences of the msdin family members in a. phalloides

the msdin genes from ap were found in many clusters on numerous scaffolds. scaffold_ <dig> contained six msdin genes, all of which had different core sequences  . three scaffolds  each had two unique msdin genes. scaffold_ <dig> had six msdin genes; two  had identical core regions , and four others, apha_msdin_ <dig> through apha_msdin_ <dig>  were unique. the three genes encoding α-amanitin and β-amanitin were clustered on scaffold_ <dig> 

the msdin genes from ab also required manual annotation. the ab genome assembly contained  <dig> msdin genes of which  <dig> were unique . the predicted proteins of  <dig> ab msdin genes started with the canonical “msdin” sequence. the first pro residue adjacent to the variable region of these predicted msdin genes was conserved in all of the predicted proteins, but three  lacked the second pro residue. additionally, four gene products  did not contain a terminal cys residue that is essential for cyclization by popb  but instead contained the similar amino acid ser.table  <dig> predicted peptide sequences of the msdin family members in a. bisporigera

many of the ab msdin genes were clustered in the genome . abis_msdin_ <dig> and  <dig>  both encoding phallacidin, were found on scaffold_ <dig>  scaffold_ <dig> had four msdin genes including abis_msdin_ <dig> and  <dig>  both of which encode α-amanitin. three genes with identical core sequences  were found on scaffold_ <dig>  two genes on scaffold_ <dig> , encoded nearly identical core regions . scaffold_ <dig> contained two msdin genes with dissimilar core sequences, abis_msdin_ <dig> and  <dig> 

in both ap and ab, a number of additional sequences were identified that showed some similarity to the msdin family but that were truncated or considered excessively divergent to be conclusively identified as members of the family. however, of possible significance to the evolution of the msdin gene family, two nearly identical sequences in ab lacked any core sequences whatsoever . despite the similarities to msdin genes, these loci were left unannotated.

orthology between ap, ab, and a. muscaria

ap and ab are both in sect. phalloideae of subgenus lepidella, and a. muscaria is in sect. amanita of subgenus amanita  <cit> . the orthology analysis resulted in a total of  <dig> ortholog groups of which  <dig> contained at least one protein from each of the three species. there were  <dig> ortholog groups that contained proteins from only am and ap,  <dig> groups with proteins only from am and ab, and  <dig> groups consisting of proteins only from ap and ab. the remaining  <dig> groups each contained proteins from only one species. both the pop genes and the msdin genes were clustered within the ortholog groups . one group containing eight proteins included both popa and popb from both ap and ab and one protein from a. muscaria  . this protein is annotated as a prolyl oligopeptidase by jgi and a blastp search against the ncbi nr database shows it shares 77% identity with popa from ab  and 66% identity with popa from gm . the a. muscaria gene is therefore probably the ortholog of popa, the “housekeeping” pop .

an additional twelve orthologous groups were found to contain msdin proteins. seven of these contained proteins from a single species . one of these groups contained two copies of phalloidin in ap . in another of these single species ortholog groups, cycloamanide b  was predicted to be an ortholog of apha_msdin_ <dig>  the only difference being a single amino acid subsitution  in the core region. the remaining five ortholog groups all contained proteins from both ab and ap. one contained two identical core regions, apha_msdin_ <dig> and abis_msdin_ <dig>  a presumptive peptide shared between the species. one group contained three identical core regions identified as phallacidin, two from ab and one from ap. α-amanitin in ap  grouped with one msdin from ab  as well as a second ap protein . the final two groups contained orthologs from both ab and ap with one or more differences within the core regions.

comparison of the msdin family in ap, ab, and other amanita species

ap and ab together contained a total of  <dig> msdin sequences representing  <dig> unique core regions . only α-amanitin, phallacidin, and one unnamed predicted octapeptide  were common between ab and ap. overall, ap has  <dig> non-duplicate core regions and ab has  <dig> 

tryptathione, the cross-bridge formed between trp and cys, is a hallmark of the amatoxins and phallotoxins  <cit> . only one gene  encodes a novel peptide capable of containing tryptathionine, i.e., core sequence awlaecp. it differs by one amino acid from phalloidin, having glu instead of thr at amino acid # <dig>  <cit> . in having an acidic residue at position # <dig>  it resembles phallacidin. this core sequence was also present in amanita rimosa  <cit> . all of the other msdin genes probably encode monocyclic peptides.

the msdin family in ap and ab has some overlap with the msdin family in a. exitialis, a mushroom implicated in multiple human poisonings in china  <cit> . in addition to α-amanitin, β-amanitin, and phallacidin, the transcriptome of a. exitialis contains genes encoding lffppdfrpp  and ifwfiyfp . neither ab nor ap contains a gene for the nonapeptide amanexitide, cyclo, which was isolated from a. exitialis  <cit> .

expression of the novel msdin family members
to determine whether any of the novel msdin family members were expressed, rnaseq was performed with mrna extracted from ab basidiocarps. transcripts for  <dig> unique  msdin sequences were detected , including phallacidin and α-amanitin. in every case, the transcript sequences confirmed the presence of an intron interrupting the fourth from the last codon . the strong consensus for the last two amino acids of the msdin family precursor peptides was leu-cys .

it was of particular interest whether any of the novel msdin genes were expressed at the level of actual cyclic peptides. ap is known to produce cyclic peptides other than the bicyclic amatoxins and phallotoxins  <cit> . these include the cycloamanides and antamanide  <cit> . the four known cycloamanides are monocyclic hexa-, hepta-, or octapeptides, and antamanide is a monocyclic decapeptide. other than being cyclized, none have the post-translational modifications characteristic of the amatoxins and phallotoxins such as tryptathionine bridge formation, hydroxylation, and α-carbon epimerization. although the cycloamanides are considered to be non-toxic to mammals, some have immunosuppressive activity, and antamanide  protects mice against the toxic effects of phallotoxins and blocks mitochondrial pore formation  <cit> . ap had a gene  encoding cycloamanide b, cyclo. we did not find genes for any of the other cycloamanides or antamanide in ap or ab. however, predicted decapeptides related to antamanide were present in both ap and ab. ap contained fffppffipp , irlpplflpp , lrlppfmipp , and fifppfiipp . ab contained ffqppefrpp  <cit>  and lffppdfrpp  and lfyppdfrpp . the consensus for these seven decapeptide sequences  contains two pairs of pro residues.

to determine if any of the novel predicted peptides were produced, extracts of ap were fractionated by high performance lc, and the masses of the unknown cyclic peptides in table  <dig> were monitored by mass spectrometry . masses corresponding to the cyclized versions with zero to four hydroxylations were extracted based on analogy to the phallotoxins and amatoxins, which can each have up to four hydroxylations.

α-amanitin, β-amanitin, phalloidin, phallacidin, and several minor toxins  were detectable by lc/ms in ap extracted by the standard 50% methanol procedure  <cit> . all of the known amatoxins and phallotoxins can be encoded by just four genes, corresponding to core peptide sequences iwgigcnp, iwgigcdp, awlvdcp, and awlatcp  <cit> . no compounds with the predicted masses of any of the hypothetical peptides with novel core sequences were detected in the methanol extracts except one compound of m + h+ of m/z  <dig>  which could correspond to cyclo with three hydroxylations. on the basis of its mass, this compound was purified by two steps of reverse phase chromatography. its relative uv absorbances at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 305 nm were consistent with the presence of tyr. however, the high resolution monoisotopic mass of the compound as determined by tof/ms was  <dig> , giving a most probable elemental formula of c34h52n8o <dig>  the elemental composition of the putative trihydroxylated derivative of cyclo would be c39h56n8o <dig>  giving a monoisotopic mass of  <dig> . the mass discrepancy , supported by the relative heights of the 13c/12c signals, precluded the novel compound from being the predicted cyclic peptide. elucidation of the structure of the compound of m/z  <dig>  is in progress.

many of the predicted novel peptides have a preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids, and the cycloamanides were originally found in the lipophilic extracts of ap  <cit> . hydrophobicity is an important pharmacokinetic property because it affects both the water solubility and the membrane permeability of a peptide. therefore, ethanol/chloroform extracts of ap were also analyzed by lc/ms. nominal masses corresponding to some of the predicted unmodified cyclized peptides in table  <dig> were detected. one of m/z  <dig>  could correspond to apha_msdin_ <dig>  cyclo, which differs by one amino acid from cycloamanide b. this compound was analyzed in more detail by ms/ms and mmass  <cit> . the elemental composition  was consistent with this structure . furthermore, the ms/ms fragmentation pattern and analysis by mmass strongly supported the predicted amino acid composition and sequence, i.e., sequential loss of val, pro, phe, phe, and phe and giving overlapping peptide fragments for full coverage of the cyclic backbone . this new compound, predicted from the genome sequence, has been named cycloamanide e. lc/ms/ms also indicated the presence of another novel cycloamanide, apha_msdin_ <dig>  with a structure of cyclo. this compound, eluting at  <dig>  min, had a mass of  <dig>   and mmass analysis indicated the expected amino acid composition and sequence .

amino acid distribution in the core regions
as previously reported for ab based on its partial genome sequence  <cit> , the core regions of the msdin family in the full genomic complement of both ab and ap were more variable than the leader and follower sequences . the predicted core peptides ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids with a mean of  <dig>  in ap and  <dig>  in ab and a mode of  <dig> in both .fig.  <dig> weblogo  <cit>  alignment of msdin sequences from the genomes of a

the distribution of amino acids in the core regions of the msdin family were similar in ab and ap . every proteinogenic amino acid was found in at least one msdin family member. pro was the most abundant amino acid in the core regions of both species. this was due to not just the conserved terminal pro required for processing by popb but also to a disproportionately high number of internal pro residues. there was also an overall bias towards the hydrophobic amino acids ile and phe and against charged and polar residues such as thr, arg, and ser .fig.  <dig> observed vs. expected amino acid distribution in the core regions of the msdin peptides from ap. hydrophobic amino acids are shown in red and polar/charged amino acids in green. the line indicates a slope =  <dig> . additional file 1: table s <dig> shows the results for ab





conservation in the leader and follower sequences
in addition to the two pro residues required for processing by popb, two leu residues in the c-terminus, seven residues apart, are highly conserved in the msdin precursor peptides . although the c-terminus of the α-amanitin gene  of gm is highly divergent from that of ab, both have leu and either leu  or the similar amino acid ile  at the same positions  <cit> . these observations are consistent with the importance of an amphipathic α-helix in the c-terminal portion of the precursor peptide for correct cyclization by popb, as was hypothesized  <cit> .

changing the terminal cys to ala inhibits cyclization by gmpopb of the α-amanitin precursor peptide gmama <dig>  <cit> . several of the precursor peptides predicted end in ser rather than the canonical cys . however due to their chemically similar side chains it is possible that ser can functionally subsitute for cys.table  <dig> msdin peptides previously reported from the genome of ab  <cit>  but not found in the current genome sequence. ilmlailp  was also reported by zhou et al.  <cit>  from ab





determination of the internal transcribed spacer  region sequences in ab and ap
the its sequences of both ab and ap were obtained from the genome sequences using the its sequence of ab as query . the ap its sequence showed 100% identity with genbank accessions gq <dig>  eu <dig>  kf <dig>  gq <dig>  and u <dig>  as well as many others, all of which are annotated as a. phalloides. the its region of the specimen of ab sequenced in the current work was 100% identical to genbank accessions gq <dig> and kj <dig>  both of which are annotated as a. bisporigera, and 99% identical to kp <dig>  kj <dig>  and several others annotated as a. suballiacea. the its region was also 98–99% identical to genbank accessions annotated as amanita sp. ‘sp-o01’, amanita sp. ‘ <dig> zly-2014’, a. virosa, or a. ocreata. most of these sequences and the specimens from which they were obtained have not been described outside of genbank. the its of the specimen of ab sequenced in this paper was 92% identical to the its sequence of the specimen of ab sequenced earlier  <cit> , which was deposited in genbank in  <dig> with accession number ay <dig>  since then, many additional amanita its sequences have been deposited in genbank. as of this writing, ay <dig> shows 99–100% identity with sequences annotated as a. bisporigera , a. virosa , a. phalloides , a. marmorata , and a. verna . that is, there appear to be many discrepancies between its sequences and fungal nomenclature in regard to ab and its close relatives.

msdin gene family differences within ab
based on a partial genome sequence,  <dig> members of the msdin family were earlier described from ab  <cit> . the genome of ab described in the current work has  <dig> total and  <dig> unique msdin family members . surprisingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences described in hallen et al.  <cit>  were not found in the current genome sequence . in contrast, all eight of the previously described msdin sequences from ap were present in the current ap genome  <cit> . a possible explanation for the result with ab comes from consideration of the relatively low identity of the its regions  of the specimen sequenced here compared to the one sequenced earlier  <cit> . that is, despite their morphological similarity and having been collected in the same location, the specimen sequenced earlier and the one sequenced in this paper are sufficiently different that it is reasonable to consider them to be distinct species, and this is reflected in their different complement of msdin sequences.

annotation and analysis of prolyl oligopeptidase  genes
the initial post-translational processing of the msdin precursor peptides is catalyzed in gm by a specialized prolyl oligopeptidase called popb  <cit> . gmpopb differs from gmpopa and from other pops from other organisms in several respects. first, gmpopb can act on larger peptides  compared to other pops, which are limited to peptides of ~ <dig> amino acids. second, it poorly utilizes the model substrate z-gly-pro-p-nitroanilide compared to other pops. third, it can catalyze not only peptide bond hydrolysis but also transpeptidation, thereby converting the 35-amino acid α-amanitin precursor peptide to cyclo  <cit> .

the intron/exon structures of the popa and popb genes of ab  had been experimentally determined previously  <cit> . predicted popa and popb proteins from a. muscaria and ab were aligned to the draft ab and ap genome assemblies, and these alignments along with snap and augustus ab initio gene predictions were used to guide manual annotation of the ap pop genes. appopa was found on scaffold_ <dig>  and appopb on scaffold_ <dig>  abpopa was found on scaffold_ <dig>  abpopb was on scaffold_ <dig>  but the underlying sequence contains several gaps. the pop gene models were added to the final annotation, protein, and transcript files.

searching all ascomycota and basidiomycota sequences in the jgi databases using blastp and either popa or popb as queries indicated that pop genes are present throughout the basidiomycota but there are no clear pop homologs in any species in the ascomycota. the lack of pop genes in the ascomycota is surprising because pops are clearly present in all other branches of life, including bacteria, plants, and animals  <cit> . most basidiomycota have a single pop gene, including a. muscaria and a. thiersii, which do not have the msdin gene family and do not produce known cyclic peptide toxins. however, the cyclic peptide-producing fungi that have been sequenced  each have two pops  <cit> . when aligned, the popas of the toxin-producing fungi and the single pop proteins of a. muscaria and a. thiersii formed one clade and the popbs formed another . this is consistent with popa representing a “housekeeping” enzyme, albeit of unknown function, and popb being a pop dedicated to cyclic peptide biosynthesis. despite the greater taxonomic distance between galerina  and amanita  than between ab and ap, popa of gm more closely aligned with the popas of the two amanita species than to its own popb . the popbs showed the same relationship. the clustering of popbs with each other and popas with each other was also true when just the catalytic domains or just the propeller domains were aligned . this suggests that both domains contribute to the unique catalytic properties of popb.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree based on alignment of pop proteins from species of amanita, galerina marginata, and porcine . ap, a. phalloides; ab, a. bisporigera; amusc, a. muscaria; athier, a. thiersii; gm, g. marginata. genbank acession numbers of abpopa, abpopb, gmpopa, and gmpopb are adn <dig>  adn <dig>  aex <dig>  and aex <dig>  respectively. jgi identifiers for amuscpop and athierpop are amamu1| <dig> and amath1| <dig>  respectively. popb proteins are in red and underlined. protein alignments and tree construction were performed using upgma within clustalw and  <dig> bootstrap replicates in mega version  <dig>  <cit> 




gene clustering of msdin genes and popb genes
in gm, popb is clustered with one of the two copies of ama <dig>  encoding the precursor peptide of α-amanitin  <cit> . a 15-kb genomic lambda clone from the specimen of ab sequenced earlier  <cit>  contained the abpopb gene and one of the msdin family members   <cit> . otherwise, the current results did not reveal any further evidence of clustering of popb with any member of the msdin family in either ab or ap.

discussion
based on their complete genomes, amanita phalloides  and a. bisporigera  together have the genetic capacity to encode more than  <dig> unique small, cyclic peptides on the same biosynthetic scaffold that they use to biosynthesize the amatoxins and phallotoxins. additional members of the msdin gene family have been described in other species of amanita sect. phalloideae, including a. ocreata, a. exitialis, a. rimosa, and others  <cit> , indicating that collectively this taxon has a large capacity to make a diversity of small peptides. most of them are predicted to be cyclic but otherwise unmodified, like the cycloamanides, but it is possible that some of them are further modified by, e.g., hydroxylations, like the amatoxins and phallotoxins.

there is little overlap in the complement of msdin genes between species. ab and ap have only three msdin genes in common . ab and a. exitialis  have three known genes in common . ap and a. exitialis have four genes in common: α-amanitin, β-amanitin, phallacidin, and apha_msdin_ <dig>  because the genome assemblies that we have prepared for ap and ab are draft quality assemblies, it is possible that additional msdin genes are present in the genomes of the two species.

surprisingly, the majority of the msdin genes found earlier in ab were not present in the current ab genome. the ones in common were α-amanitin, phallacidin, and three unknowns. the most plausible explanation for this is that the two specimens, both identified on morphological criteria as “a. bisporigera”, are, in fact, different species. this is supported by comparison of their its sequences. considering the high degree of variation between the msdin complement of ab and ap and between both specimens of ab and a. exitialis, the degree of variation we observed between the two specimens of ab seems consistent with them being distinct species. this result also suggests that within amanita sect. phalloideae the msdin gene family is even larger than our current taxonomic understanding would indicate.

in contrast to ab sensu lato, analyses of the toxins and msdin genes of ap are consistent with it being a single, discrete species. li et al.  <cit>  identified six msdin genes by pcr from a specimen of ap collected in italy. all six genes were present in our isolate of ap collected in california. the genomic similarity between italian and california isolates of ap is consistent with their similar chemical profiles and the recent introduction of ap from europe into north america  <cit> .

of the known chemically characterized cyclic peptides from ap, genes encoding α-amanitin, β-amanitin, phalloidin, phallacidin, and cycloamanide b were present in the ap genome. these five compounds are historically known to be made by specimens of ap from germany  <cit> . however, we did not find genes for cycloamanide a, c, and d, nor a gene for the cyclic decapeptide antamanide. the absence of these genes could be due to gaps in our genome assemblies or to natural variation.

among all the species of amanita whose msdin genes have been studied, most members of this family are unique to one species, and only a few are common to more than one. the most widely distributed gene throughout sect. phalloideae encodes α-amanitin. α-amanitin is highly toxic to insects, mammals, nematodes, and other organisms, and is responsible for >95% of the human deaths from mushroom poisoning  <cit> . although the biological rationale for its production is not known, its strong activity and widespread occurrence suggests that it confers a strong selective advantage to the producing fungi. β-amanitin, phalloidin, and phallacidin are also common, but not universal, in amanita sect. phalloideae. β-amanitin is as toxic to mammals as α-amanitin, and although the phallotoxins are not toxic to mammals when consumed orally, they might be toxic to other mycovores such as insects.

the genomic information predicted the existence of multiple novel cyclic peptides. two of them were found in the lipophilic fractions from extracts of ap. the novel compounds, cyclo and cyclo, are rich in hydrophobic amino acids. following the earlier naming of cycloamanides a-d, we have given them the trivial names cycloamanide e and f, respectively. this result is another example demonstrating the utility of genomics for the discovery of novel secondary metabolites  <cit> . we predict that many of the other msdin genes in ap, ab, and other amanita species will also be expressed at the chemical level. although cycloamanides a, b, and e are not post-translationally modified other than by cyclization, cycloamanides c and d contain oxidized methionine  <cit> . it is therefore possible that some of the other chemical products of the msdin family might also be post-translationally modified, which would make their detection by lc/ms more difficult.

within the genus amanita, the msdin family is found only in section phalloideae  <cit> . however, α-amanitin is also produced by other agarics including some species of galerina and lepiota  <cit> . like ab and ap, gm produces α-amanitin on ribosomes as a 35-amino acid precursor peptide. however, outside the core region itself the primary sequences of the α-amanitin genes of gm and ab are highly divergent, although both are predicted to form amphipathic α-helices in their c-termini  regions  <cit> . this conserved secondary structure might be important for correct processing by popb. another difference betwen gm and toxin-producing species of amanita is that the genome of gm has only two copies of the gene for α-amanitin and no extended msdin-like family  <cit> . the genes for α-amanitin have not yet been described from any species of lepiota.

known biological activities of the msdin family to date include inhibition of rna polymerase ii , stabilization of f-actin , immunosuppression , protection of hepatocytes against phallotoxins and amatoxins , and blocking the mitochondrial permeability transition pore   <cit> . it is unknown what, if any, biological activities the other predicted cyclic peptides in the genomes of ap and ab might have, but their evolutionary persistence suggests that they confer some selective advantage to the producing fungi. furthermore, the observation that the core regions of the msdin family show strong amino acid bias suggests that the core sequences are not mutating randomly. that is, if they were mainly nonexpressed and conferred no advantage to the producing fungi, the core regions would not show any amino acid bias. an adaptive function implies that they have biological activities at the molecular level, which are as yet unknown. the natural function of none of the amanita cyclic peptides are known, but could perhaps protect the fruiting bodies against mycophagy by insects, nematodes, or gastropods.

currently, only small quantities of the known minor peptides such as the cycloamanides are available because cyclic peptide-producing fungi are obligately ectomycorrhizal and are difficult or impossible to culture  <cit> . however, it may be possible to make compounds such as cycloamanide e in vitro from 25mer or 35mer linear precursors using the macrocyclase activity of popb  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
two toxic species of amanita have large but essentially non-overlapping potential for cyclic peptide biosynthesis. the msdin family of ribosomally encoded peptides is evolving rapidly in amanita section phalloideae.
