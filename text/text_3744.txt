BACKGROUND
in most multicellular lineages, the branch points that lead to multicellularity lie so deep in the past that molecular details of this key step on the path to complex organisms have been obscured by the passage of time. fortunately, there is an exception. molecular phylogenetic analysis of volvocine algae showed that the last common ancestor of the unicellular chlamydomonas reinhardtii  and the multicellular volvox carteri, with its differentiated cell types , lived only ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in addition, not only do both unicellular and multicellular forms with differentiated cell types exist within this group, but also forms that are intermediate in organizational complexity between chlamydomonas and volvox, such as gonium . a stepwise progression in organismal complexity can be arranged with these and other species of this group, which shows an increase in the number of cells, the degree to which cellular labor is divided between cell types, and the amount of extracellular matrix . due to the properties discussed above, volvocine algae attract the interest of researchers who are studying the molecular evolution of multicellularity and cellular differentiation.

the detailed molecular analysis of any species requires its accessibility to genetic manipulation. among the volvocine algae, transformation procedures have only been established for c. reinhardtii  <cit>  and v. carteri  <cit> . similarly, other molecular tools, such as selectable markers and reporter genes, are only available for c. reinhardtii and v. carteri, and, moreover, only the genomes of these volvocine species have been sequenced . unfortunately, no molecular tools and hardly any nucleotide sequence data are available for genera that are intermediate in organizational complexity between chlamydomonas and volvox. because a molecular analysis of species with intermediate organizational complexity is important for the understanding of molecular evolution, we planned to establish a transformation technique in gonium pectorale to allow for its genetic manipulation. this coenobial  volvocine green alga builds a slightly convex plate, which typically contains  <dig> cells in a rather square or rhomboidal arrangement, with four cells in the center and  <dig> cells in the periphery   <cit> . consistent with its position near the base of the volvocine family tree  <cit> , gonium exhibits a number of developmental processes that also occur during the development of its larger and more complex relatives  <cit>  but that are not part of the chlamydomonas developmental program.

an important precondition for genetic transformation is the availability of an appropriate selectable, preferably dominant, marker. two such genes have been shown to work in both v. carteri and c. reinhardtii, which are the ble gene of streptoalloteichus hindustanus, which mediates resistance to zeocin, and the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase viii gene  of streptomyces rimosus, which confers resistance to paromomycin  <cit> .

both genes are dominant because they add new, selectable features to transformants, and therefore do not require strains with particular auxotrophic defects as recipients. the ble protein is a binding protein, which requires a 1: <dig> ratio of ble and zeocin. in contrast, the enzyme aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase viii achieves high-affinity phosphorylation of paromomycin, and, as an enzyme, it works at lower concentrations than a simple binding protein. therefore, the aphviii gene was determined to be more appropriate for transformation.

the expression of foreign genes is mostly carried out by using endogenous 5'-utrs, including promoter sequences, and endogenous 3'-utrs  <cit> . if the genome of a target species has been sequenced, appropriate 5'- and 3'-sequences can be found with bioinformatic tools and can be easily amplified by pcr. unfortunately, the genome of gonium or other volvocine species, except for c. reinhardtii and v. carteri, has not been sequenced. although there is limited sequence information from a few coding sequences for these species, there is no sequence information for the corresponding 5'- and 3'-utrs, and no information is available as to whether the genes are strongly and constitutively expressed. because 5'- and 3'-utrs are weakly conserved even between closely related species, sequence information from related species is not appropriate to allow for amplification of utrs by standard pcr. in addition, cloning and sequencing of flanking sequences is time consuming. thus, our strategy was to test flanking sequences that were derived from species closely related to gonium. previously, it has been shown that flanking sequences from c. reinhardtii could work in v. carteri and vice versa  <cit> . we decided to utilize such flanking sequences in gonium transformation experiments with glass beads or with two different particle guns.

in order to allow the application of efficient molecular genetic approaches in g. pectorale, appropriate reporter genes that can express functional proteins within this species are also required. the candidate reporter genes that we tested included the arylsulfatase  gene from v. carteri  <cit> , the tagged heat shock protein 70a  gene from v. carteri  <cit> , and the luciferase  gene from g. princeps, which had been previously codon-optimized for expression in c. reinhardtii  <cit> .

here we report the stable nuclear transformation of g. pectorale by particle gun bombardment using the heterologous, dominant antibiotic resistance gene aphviii of s. rimosus fused to heterologous 3'- and 5'-untranslated flanking sequences, including promoters, from c. reinhardtii and v. carteri. we also show that the heterologously expressed luciferase gene from g. princeps, which was codon-optimized for c. reinhardtii, can serve as a suitable reporter gene in gonium.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of utilized gonium pectorale strains
the identity of the utilized wild type gonium pectorale strains sag  <dig> , ccap 32/ <dig> and nies- <dig> was verified in a phylogenetic analysis using four dna sequences   <cit> . both background and procedures of the phylogenetic analysis are described in additional file  <dig>  alignments are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  calculations of sequence identities are given in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and phylogenetic trees are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

preliminary transformation studies using aphviii-based selectable marker plasmids
for transformation experiments with g. pectorale, the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase viii gene  of streptomyces rimosus was used as a selectable marker. in the plasmid ppmr <dig>  the aphviii gene is under the control of a v. carteri hsp70a-rbcs <dig> hybrid promoter, and the 3'-utr is derived from the v. carteri rbcs <dig> gene  <cit>  . in plasmid paphg the aphviii gene is under control of a c. reinhardtii hsp70a-rbcs <dig> hybrid promoter, and the 3'-utr is derived from the c. reinhardtii rbcs <dig> gene  <cit>  . this dna construct also contains intron  <dig> of the rbcs <dig> gene  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start codon. the plasmid paphg includes not just one copy of this hybrid aphviii gene construct but  <dig> repeated aphviii cassettes, this resulting in a higher gene dosage  <cit> .

we attempted to transform g. pectorale  by using both plasmids and the glass bead-mediated transformation protocol   <cit>  and protocols using a homemade particle gun  <cit> . after this treatment and a 48-h recovery period, cells were spread on agar plates with paromomycin, but no transformants were obtained. however, we realized in control experiments that we were not even able to grow the wild type cells on agar plates without paromomycin if only a few viable cells were spread per plate. therefore, in all the following experiments, selection for paromomycin-resistance was performed in liquid medium.

in parallel to the aphviii-based selectable marker plasmids, a promoterless aphviii construct was tested, since a similar promoter-trapping attempt had worked in chlamydomonas  <cit> . using the particle gun and the promoterless aphviii, a single paromomycin-resistant transformant was obtained . this transformant was retained and was stable, and its paromomycin-resistance has persisted over three years. unfortunately, about ten attempts to reproduce this result have failed.

recovery of transformants after biolistic transformation
after these unsuccessful attempts, a biolistic method for transformation, which was modified from previous protocols  <cit> , in combination with the aphviii-based plasmids ppmr <dig> and paphg and selection in liquid medium, made the reproducible recovery of g. pectorale transformants possible. optimization of the transformation protocol was done by changing several parameters systematically . in the most successful protocol, gold microprojectiles  were coated with plasmid dna by a modified ethanol precipitation in the presence of cacl <dig> and spermidine . logarithmically growing g. pectorale cells  were spread on a cellulose acetate membrane filter, with all liquid removed, and a pds-1000/he biolistic device  was used to introduce the plasmid-coated microprojectiles into the cells by high-velocity bombardment. an overview of the most successful combination of transformation parameters is provided in table  <dig>  after microprojectile bombardment, cells were distributed evenly among  <dig> flasks  and incubated for  <dig> h under standard conditions without selective pressure. after the addition of  <dig> μg paromomycin/ml, the cultures clarified within  <dig> h due to the death of most cells. re-greening of culture flasks within 9– <dig> days of further incubation indicated the presence of antibiotic-resistant transformants . due to the cultivation in liquid medium, we could not easily determine whether the transformed organisms were descendants of a single transformant or of more than one transformant. thus, we assumed a yield of only one transformant per flask, even if there could be more than one. based on this assumption, the transformation efficiency was estimated to be ~ <dig>  × 10- <dig> and ~ <dig>  × 10- <dig> when the plasmids ppmr <dig> and paphg were used as selectable marker plasmids, respectively. similar transformation efficiencies were achieved when we repeated the experiments on different wild type strains .

within each subgroup, the condition that gave the largest number of transformants was set to "+ + + + +"; there is a "-" when no transformants were recovered. the data allow just a qualitative estimation, because a) they were obtained under varying other conditions in the course of optimization, b) poor results disqualified a condition without rechecking, and c) some of the transformants might be false-positives as only a few were analyzed in detail.

for detailed analyses, the transformants were re-isolated to ensure uniform genetic conditions .

paromomycin resistance of transformants
as a reference, wild type g. pectorale cultures  were examined for their sensitivity towards paromomycin. a very low concentration of  <dig>  μg paromomycin/ml was able to kill all wild type cells . transformants were tested at antibiotic concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml, so that the lowest antibiotic concentration was five times higher than the deadly dose for wild type cells. gonium transformants that were generated using the selectable marker plasmid paphg were able to tolerate  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg paromomycin/ml , which was  <dig> –  <dig> times higher than the concentration that kills all wild type cells. transformants that were produced using ppmr <dig> tolerated  <dig>  –  <dig>  μg paromomycin/ml , which was  <dig> –  <dig> times higher than the concentration that kills all wild type cells. similar results were obtained when ppmr <dig> was co-transformed with the non-selectable plasmids described below .

stable integration of plasmid dna into the genome of transformants
to verify the integration of plasmid dna into the genome, genomic dna of strains transformed with paphg or ppmr <dig> was isolated, and the wild type gonium strain sag  <dig>  was used as a control. using these different genomic dna isolates as templates, pcr amplification of a fragment of the aphviii gene confirmed transformation. the relative positions of the amplified dna fragments are indicated in figure 2a and 2b. based on the known sequence, the size of the pcr fragment was predicted to be  <dig> bp. paromomycin-resistant transformants, which were generated either with paphg  or ppmr <dig> , yielded a pcr fragment of the expected size, whereas the wild type strain gave no such fragment, as expected. sequence analysis demonstrated that all the amplified fragments were identical to the sequence of the aphviii fragment .

in addition, genomic dna from transformants and from the parent wild type strain was analyzed on southern blots for the presence of the aphviii sequence. sequences hybridizing to a  <dig> bp fragment from the coding region of the aphviii gene were detectable in transformants, but not in the parent strain. a southern blot of genomic dna from t-j <dig>  which is a transformant that was produced with plasmid ppmr <dig>  and of genomic dna from the parent wild type strain sag  <dig>  is shown in figure 4d. the total size of plasmid ppmr <dig> is  <dig>  kb, which includes the pbluescript ii vector backbone  <cit> . based on the sequence of ppmr <dig>  and the position of the probe , a signal from a  <dig>  kb fragment was expected in the sali/psti digest, if ppmr <dig> integrated into the genome by recombination outside the coding region. such a fragment was identified in t-j <dig> dna, and no such fragment, or any other fragment, was detectable in the parent wild type strain. in t-j <dig>  a  <dig>  kb fragment was detected in the sali/hindiii digest, as expected from the plasmid sequence, and this shows that the sequences ~ <dig>  kb upstream and ~ <dig>  kb downstream of the stop codon were integrated as they appear in the plasmid ppmr <dig>  the sali/hindiii-lane also contained a weak  <dig>  kb band; this is a known hindiii – hindiii fragment , which arises from incomplete sali-digestion in the sali/hindiii double digest. this  <dig>  kb fragment contained the complete aphviii coding region, which included ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the start codon and ~ <dig>  kb downstream of the stop codon. in addition to these three genomic fragments that were arranged as predicted from the original plasmid ppmr <dig>  a  <dig>  kb sali-fragment was detected. plasmid ppmr <dig> contains only a single sali-site ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the stop codon. the second sali-site of the  <dig>  kb fragment must, therefore, be located within the genomic sequence that flanked the integrated plasmid. in addition to the ppmr3-transformants, the aphviii gene was detected on southern blots with genomic dna from transformants that were produced with plasmid paphg .

in southern blot results from nine independent transformants, six of them were judged to have a single copy of the plasmid in the genome. the other three seemed to have two or three copies as well as dna fragments of sizes that were not explainable. therefore, integration into the genome might have been more complicated in these transformants. the southern blot results suggest that frequently only one copy of the plasmid integrates into the genome.

detection of aphviii protein in transformants
based on the amino acid sequence, which was deduced from the cdna sequence, an aphviii protein of  <dig>  kda was predicted. in western blot analysis, an anti-aphviii antibody detected a ~ <dig> kda band in strains that were transformed with aphviii-based selectable marker plasmids . as expected, no aphviii protein was detectable in the parent wild type gonium strain sag  <dig> .

stable co-transformation of unselectable genes
the usefulness of a transformation system also depends on the convenience with which co-transformations with unselectable genes can be achieved, as most genes of interest do not allow for direct selection. construction of transformation vectors is more laborious and time-consuming if both the selectable and the unselectable gene must be inserted into a single plasmid, particularly when the genes are quite large. therefore, co-transformation using two separate plasmids is preferable, if possible. to test this, wild type g. pectorale organisms  were co-bombarded using plasmid ppmr <dig> , which contains the aphviii gene for selection, and the following four unselectable plasmids: 1) plasmid ptubar <dig> , in which the arylsulfatase  gene from v. carteri is under control of the β2-tubulin promoter from v. carteri  <cit> ; 2) plasmid phsp-ha , in which the tagged v. carteri heat shock protein 70a  gene is under control of its own promoter  <cit> ; 3) plasmid ppsad-gluc , in which the luciferase  gene from g. princeps is under control of the psad promoter from c. reinhardtii and in which the luc gene was codon-optimized for expression in c. reinhardtii  <cit> ; and 4) plasmid phsp70a-gluc , in which the luciferase  gene from g. princeps, which is again codon-optimized for c. reinhardtii, is fused to the first three exons of the hsp70b gene of c. reinhardtii and in which this hybrid gene is under control of the hsp70a promoter from c. reinhardtii  <cit> . paromomycin-resistant transformants were obtained from all the co-bombardments, and, in all transformants, the presence of the aphviii gene was verified by genomic pcr. the co-bombarded plasmid was detectable in ~30–50% of the paromomycin-resistant transformants regardless of which co-bombarded plasmid was used. the results of representative pcrs using genomic template dna of different paromomycin-resistant transformants co-bombarded with the selectable plasmid ppmr <dig> and the non-selectable plasmids ptubar <dig>  phsp-ha, ppsad-gluc, or phsp70a-gluc are shown in figure  <dig>  the primers are specific for each of the co-bombarded genes. the relative positions of the amplified dna fragments are indicated in figure 2c, d, e, and 2f, respectively. in each co-transformation experiment, fragments of the expected sizes of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp , and  <dig> bp  were amplified from some of the paromomycin-resistant transformants . the sequence of the amplified fragments with the correct size was confirmed by sequence analysis in each of the four co-transformation experiments, and all amplified fragments showed the correct sequence .

transcription of co-transformed, unselectable genes
the rt-pcr technique was used to verify the existence of heterologous transcripts in gonium transformants. oligonucleotide primers were selected, and the following cdna-fragments were predicted: a  <dig> bp ars fragment from ptubar <dig> co-transformants, a  <dig> bp hsp70a fragment from phsp-ha co-transformants, and a  <dig> bp luc fragment from both ppsad-gluc and phsp70a-gluc co-transformants. the relative positions of these cdna fragments are indicated in figure 2c, d, e, and 2f, respectively.

all rt-pcrs with the co-transformants yielded cdna fragments with the expected sizes, and dna sequence analysis demonstrated the correctness of the sequences . if introns were present at the corresponding position of a gene, the intron sequences were spliced correctly.

the rt-pcr experiments demonstrated that the promoters of the volvox β2-tubulin and hsp70a genes and of the chlamydomonas psad and hsp70a genes mediate transcription of co-transformed, heterologous genes in gonium.

analysis of heterologous protein expression in co-transformants
transformants that were generated through co-transformation with the ars plasmid ptubar <dig> were analyzed for arylsulfatase activity. the transformants were grown in sulfur-sufficient medium because endogenous ars genes are induced by sulfur deficiency. under these conditions, we were not able to detect any arylsulfatase activity in transformants . likewise, we were not able to detect the ha-tagged hsp70a protein in transformants that were co-transformed with plasmid phsp-ha, since there was no detectable signal in western blots using anti-ha antibodies .

transformants that were generated through co-transformation with plasmid ppsad-gluc were analyzed for luciferase activity. in the light microscope, all transformants show a wild type phenotype  without any detectable morphological differences in comparison to the parent strain sag  <dig>  , but when the coelenterazine substrate is added to the lysates of these transformants, a glow is visible to the naked eye in the darkroom . exposure to a light-sensitive film allows a simple qualitative analysis of chemiluminescence .

genomic dna from these transformants was analyzed on southern blots to estimate the number of copies that integrated into the genome. using the aphviii probe , we looked for fragments that originate from integration of plasmid ppmr <dig> into the genome, and we obtained fragments of the expected sizes  in transformants, but not in the parent wild-type strain , as described above. the co-transformed plasmid ppsad-gluc, which contains the luciferase gene, has a total size of  <dig>  kb that includes the pbluescript ii vector backbone  <cit> . the luc probe  also detected fragments of the expected sizes  in transformants, whereas no fragments were detectable in the parent wild-type strain . we were not able to assign the other fragment sizes observed in transformants due to the unknown flanking sequences. however, the relatively low number of bands in each restriction digest of genomic dna from the two transformants that are shown in figure 7d and from four other transformants that were analyzed, suggests that there are only ~1– <dig> integrations of the co-transformed plasmid, so a high gene dosage through a large number of integrations can be excluded.

transformants that were generated through co-transformation with plasmid phsp70a-gluc were also analyzed qualitatively for luciferase activity, and several of these transformants showed chemiluminescence .

to obtain quantitative expression data of the co-transformed luc gene, we analyzed the bioluminescence of ppsad-gluc-derived transformants using a luminometer ; in ppsad-gluc, the luc gene is under control of the psad promoter from c. reinhardtii. these transformants descend from the g. pectorale wild type strain sag  <dig> . for comparison, we also generated ppsad-gluc-derived transformants using a different parent g. pectorale wild type strain, ccap 32/ <dig>  the amount of light emission was extremely different in the transformants from both parent strains. several re-examinations showed that these differences are permanent . it is known from many other species that expression of transgenes is strongly influenced by the unpredictable effects of elements at the site of chromosomal integration  <cit> . for unknown reasons, most of the sag  <dig> -derived transformants showed significantly higher luciferase expression rates than the ccap 32/14-derived transformants .

because the promoter of hsp70a is heat-shock inducible in c. reinhardtii, we wanted to analyze phsp70a-gluc-derived g. pectorale transformants by measuring luciferase activities in heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked organisms. transgene expression was induced by shifting the temperature of the culture from  <dig> to 36°c for  <dig> h. after a  <dig> h recovery phase at 23°c, luciferase activity was assayed at 20°c and the induction factors were calculated by comparison with non-heat-shocked samples. for comparison, induction factors were also calculated from ppsad-gluc-derived transformants, in which the luciferase gene is driven by the psad promoter. the analyses show that heat shock induces luciferase expression to a much greater extent in those transformants in which the luciferase gene is driven by the hsp70a heat-shock promoter than it does in those in which the gene is driven by the psad promoter . thus, the c. reinhardtii hsp70a heat-shock promoter is also inducible when utilized in g. pectorale.

long term stability of dna integration and gene expression
for a variety of functional analyses, it is advantageous to have stable transformants that express the corresponding transgene for as long as possible. forty independent gonium transformants were propagated in medium that contained the antibiotic paromomycin  for two years , which corresponds to over  <dig> colony generations. during this period, none of the transformant clones was lost. after this period, pcr using genomic dna of these transformants as a template still yielded the expected  <dig> bp fragment of the aphviii gene .

in a parallel experiment,  <dig> independent transformants were kept in medium containing the antibiotic paromomycin  for ~ <dig> colony generations, then propagated for ~ <dig> colony generations in antibiotic-free medium without selective pressure, and finally cultivated again in medium containing paromomycin  for ~ <dig> colony generations. just as in the experiment under permanent selective pressure, all transformant clones survived this procedure, and the aphviii gene was still detectable by genomic pcr.

the long term stability of co-transformed genes in  <dig> luciferase expressing transformants was also examined. five months, or ~ <dig> colony generations, after transformation with the selectable marker plasmid ppmr <dig> and plasmids phsp70a-gluc  or ppsad-gluc , the luc gene was still detectable by pcr in all the initially identified co-transformants. in addition, bioluminescence assays showed that luciferase activity was unchanged after this period.

discussion
using the aphviii gene of s. rimosus and a hybrid hsp70a/rbcs promoter along with an rbcs 3'-utr from either c. reinhardtii or v. carteri, we have demonstrated that wild type g. pectorale strains can be transformed into paromomycin-resistant strains by particle gun bombardment. since there was no information with regard to activity from any homologous gonium promoter, we used heterologous promoters and were able to show their activity in g. pectorale. although the frequency of transformation was low, the transformation process was reproducible. in addition, co-transformants were recovered with a high frequency, and transformants were stable for hundreds of colony generations under selective and nonselective conditions. therefore, nuclear transformation of g. pectorale using hybrid, heterologous genes as selectable markers is feasible.

in gonium, the frequency of transformation was estimated to be ~ <dig>  × 10- <dig> or ~ <dig>  × 10- <dig> per cell in particle bombardment experiments, depending on the plasmid used. in the related multicellular species v. carteri the mean frequency of stable transformants among the survivors of the particle bombardment was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  <cit> . however, the frequency presumably would have been much lower if the calculation would have been per bombarded reproductive cell. in the unicellular relative c. reinhardtii, a transformation rate of  <dig>  –  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per recipient cell was calculated when cell wall-deficient cells were treated using a glass bead transformation protocol  <cit> . in gonium, the estimated efficiency of transformation was based on two assumptions, which were that all the cells that were used in a transformation experiment were bombarded by microprojectiles and that only a maximum of one transformant arose per cultivation flask. in reality, only a fraction of the cells are hit by a microprojectile. most cells lie outside the target zone, many cells are covered by other cells, others are not hit even though they are within the target zone, and quite a few cells get lost during handling. in addition, it is very likely that more than one transformant occasionally arose per flask, but we counted and propagated only one transformant if a population of cells grew in a culture flask after particle bombardment under selective pressure. due to these reasons, the efficiency of transformation, which is considered to be the number of independently transformed cells per total number of treated wild type cells, is probably higher than the estimated number given above, but it is not possible to determine the exact number of treated cells if a particle gun is used for transformation. the efficiency of transformation should not be a limiting factor for researchers because gonium is a tiny organism that grows to high densities, and the cultivation of millions of colonies requires minimal expenses.

the cause of the better yields of gonium transformation with the plasmid ppmr <dig> with its flanking sequences from v. carteri when compared with the plasmid paphg with its flanking sequences from c. reinhardtii and its  <dig> repeated cassettes remains unclear. possible reasons might be that the volvox-derived hybrid promoter in ppmr <dig> is more similar to gonium promoters than the chlamydomonas-derived hybrid promoter in paphg or that the uptake and integration of the  <dig>  kb plasmid paphg were not as efficient as that of the  <dig>  kb plasmid ppmr <dig> 

for practical uses, the co-transformation rate is of special interest because it is more convenient to combine a known selectable marker plasmid and an unselectable plasmid containing the gene of interest, instead of constructing a single, large plasmid with unselectable and selectable genes. in gonium, the co-transformation frequency was estimated to be ~30–50%, which means that ~3– <dig> co-transformants can be recovered from a single bombardment session of the type described in the methods section. in v. carteri, frequencies of 10–60%  <cit>  and 40–80%  <cit>  were reported for two different transformation systems. in c. reinhardtii, frequencies of ~50%  <cit>  or up to 80%  <cit>  were achieved. these data show that co-transformation frequencies are quite high in gonium and other volvocine algae, and, thus, co-transformation can be used routinely in these species.

we also show that the co-transformed genes were integrated into the genome and that they were also transcribed. we were not able to show protein function or protein expression in transformants that were generated using the plasmids ptubar <dig> and phsp-ha, which should have made arylsulfatase and the tagged heat shock protein 70a, respectively. possible reasons why the arylsulfatase or hsp70a genes fail to produce a detectable amount of  protein are: 1) there are codons within these genes that are rarely or not used in gonium; 2) the heterologous proteins are improperly folded, which leads not only to a lack of activity but also to quick protein degradation; 3) gonium detects expression-limiting regulatory elements in the heterologous coding sequences  <cit> ; 4) at least one intron/exon boundary within these heterologous genes is not easily recognized in the gonium nucleus, which leads to a frameshift and a wrong/truncated polypeptide chain that is quickly degraded; 5) gonium recognizes an additional intron/exon boundary in these heterologous genes, which also leads to a wrong/truncated polypeptide chain that is quickly degraded; 6) the arylsulfatase needs a posttranslational modification for activity  <cit> , which is not added in gonium.

however, transformants that were generated using the plasmids ppsad-gluc and phsp70a-gluc showed functional expression of luciferase through light emission, which is easily detected in bioluminescence assays. therefore, the heterologous luciferase gene is a suitable reporter gene in gonium.

CONCLUSIONS
the availability of a transformation system that is based on a dominant selectable marker now makes extensive genetic engineering of gonium possible. the strategy to use a bacterial antibiotic resistance gene and flanking sequences from close relatives might also be of interest for those researchers seeking to transform species without sequenced genomes but with sequenced relatives. the existence of a transformation system for gonium also allows for more detailed studies of the molecular evolution of genes that regulate cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and extracellular matrix biogenesis. this can be done by manipulating and comparing volvocine species with increasing organismal complexity, such as chlamydomonas, gonium, and volvox, via expression of homologous, heterologous, artificial, chimeric , or otherwise modified genes.
