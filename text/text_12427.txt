BACKGROUND
cd <dig>  is a member of the sialomucin family, a mucin containing sialic acid, which is highly conserved in humans and other species  <cit> . the human cd <dig> gene is located on chromosome 6q <dig>  <cit> . cd <dig> was first identified on cd34+ human hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow stromal reticular cells  <cit> . cd <dig> has been implicated in adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells  <cit> . cd <dig> was suggested to mediate the adhesion of cd34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells to bone marrow stromal cells and sdf-1-induced binding to bone marrow endothelial cells  <cit> . cd <dig> is thought to regulate hematopoiesis by facilitating the adhesion of human cd34+ cells to bone marrow stroma  <cit> . knocking down cd <dig> expression in drosophila s <dig> cells increased the cell apoptosis rate  <cit> . cd <dig> also participated in the localization of prostate cancer cells to the bone marrow and has been identified new markers for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  <cit> . previous work also confirmed the roles of cd <dig> on the development of colorectal cancer  <cit> . cd <dig> gene expression is regulated by specific transcription factors which bind to the promoter region, regulating cell growth and differentiation. our attention has recently turned to an investigation of the cis-regulatory elements of cd <dig>  determining the optimal promoter region and transcription factors governing cd <dig> expression is important in understanding cd <dig> functions.

in the present study, we proceeded to identify cd <dig> promoter and performed the functional analysis of cis-regulatory element on cd <dig> expression.

methods
 <dig>  prediction of promoter
promoter  <dig>  prediction server was employed for prediction of promoter. as cd <dig> first exon begins on  <dig>  atgtcgcggc, the  <dig> bp sequence 5' upstream of tss were analyzed by the this method.

 <dig>  construction of plasmids
human c-jun expression plasmid pcmv-2/c-jun, which contains the full-length coding region of human c-jun cdna cloned in pcmv- <dig> vector and pcmv- <dig> empty vector, were gifts from dr. gavin p. collett . vector plasmids pcdna <dig> -hif-1a and pcdna <dig>  were kindly donated by dr. zhou . firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pgl3-basic was purchased from promega. for construction of 5'-deletions of cd <dig> promoter reporter plasmids, human genomic dna was isolated using the flexigene dna kit , the cd <dig> promoter candidate fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction  from genomic dna, and pgl3p <dig> - <dig> fragment was synthesized by two complementary strand oligonucleotides. fragments were cloned into the pcr <dig> -topo vector . cloning of different fragments to pgl3-basic , which is a vector carrying the firefly luciferase gene were performed after the restrictive enzyme cut. the restrictive endonucleases used for the cloning are shown in table  <dig>  the restriction endonucleases which were used predominantly were sac i and xholi, except p <dig> fragment, because of an internal saci site existing in fragments between p <dig> and p <dig> . p <dig> segment was obtained by using the kpni and xholi sites in pcr <dig> -topo vector. finally, all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. the oligonucleotides used for pcr primers are shown in table  <dig>

 <dig>  luciferase activity assay
firefly  luciferase is widely used as a reporter of promoter activities by cloning interested promoters to the upstream of the firefly luciferase coding gene. nowadays, the dual-reporter assays, where the activities of firefly and renilla  luciferases are measured sequentially from a single sample, are commonly used to improve experimental accuracy. the activity of the experimental reporter  is normalized by the activity of the internal control . cells were transfected with constructed reporter vectors simultaneously with phrl vector  containing cdna coding renilla luciferase;  <dig> ng of the latter was applied to each well in a 24-well plate.  <dig> hrs after transfection, cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer, a component of the dual-luciferase reporter  assay system , according to the manufacturer's instructions. an appropriate volume of cell lysate was added to a well of the f <dig> microwell™ plates , followed by  <dig> μl of larii. firefly luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer . renilla luciferase activities were also measured. relative luciferase activity was represented by the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to renilla luciferase activity. each experimental group included  <dig> repeats and data were shown as means.

 <dig>  cell culture
in this work, hct <dig> cells  were exclusively used to study the role of cd <dig> in cancer development. all the cell lines were obtained from the european collection of cell cultures  and cultured in a co <dig> incubator . hct <dig> and ht <dig> cell lines were cultured in dmem and sw <dig>  k <dig> in rpmi- <dig> medium supplemented with penicillin g , streptomycin  and 10% fetal calf serum . cells were grown at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig> and were routinely sub-cultured using  <dig> %  trypsin-edta solution. for testing promoters' activity under hypoxia, cells were transiently transfected with pgl3p <dig> plasmids and cultured in dmem without serum for  <dig> hours; then the cells were transferred into an invivo <dig> 400™ hypoxia workstation  for different time courses.

 <dig>  western blot
protein used for western blotting was extracted with mripa buffer containing protease inhibitors . proteins were quantified using bcatm protein assay kit . the western blot system was set up using a biorad bis-tris gel system, according to the manufacturer's instructions . rabbit-anti-human hif-1alpha antibody  was prepared in 3% blocking buffer at a dilution of 1: <dig>  the primary antibody was incubated with the membrane at 4ºc overnight followed by a brief wash and incubation with secondary antibody for  <dig> hour at room temperature. finally, peroxide and luminol solutions 1: <dig>  were added to cover the blot surface for five minutes at room temperature and the membrane was placed in a developing cassette.

 <dig>  chromatin precipitation
chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay was performed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, hct <dig> cells were transfected with pcdna <dig> -hif-1a. forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were then cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for  <dig> min. the formaldehyde was quenched using  <dig> m glycine for  <dig> min. at room temperature before harvest. cells were collected by centrifuging in pbs containing protease inhibitors and were lysed in sds-lysis buffer. soluble chromatin was prepared after sonication to an average dna length of  <dig> to  <dig> bp. fragmented chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4°c on a rotating platform, using antibodies against hif-1alpha  together with protein a/g plus-agarose. the agarose beads were washed, chromatin extracted and protein-dna cross-links reversed. dna was purified and was analyzed by pcr using the specific primers . normal immunoglobulin g  was used as a negative control. anti-rna polymerase ii was used as positive control. the total input was the supernatant from the no-antibody control.

 <dig>  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
the total rnas were isolated from cells with trizol® reagent  and possible genomic dna contamination were eliminated by treatment with rnase-free dnase  <dig>  for  <dig> hr. the extracted rnas were immediately reverse-transcribed using the smarttm mmlv rt reverse transcriptase cdna kit . real-time pcr was carried out on the iq™ <dig> multicolor real-time pcr detection system  using the following specific primers: -

cd <dig> ;

gapdh .

the pcr primer pairs were designed with primer <dig> software. primer specificity has been validated by blast analysis. real-time pcr was performed using sybr green master mix  with mg2+ concentration  <dig> mm, template cdna and  <dig>  μm of each primer, with rna-negative and water controls. the qpcr cycle was 98°c for  <dig> min.,  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec., 60°c for  <dig> sec. final melt-curve analysis  was included. the standard curve was produced with slopes at approximately - <dig>  ; pcr quantification used ΔΔct method for the cd <dig> against the gapdh for normalization. the data are representative of the means of three experiments.

RESULTS
identification of cd <dig> promoter
promoter  <dig>  prediction server  <cit>  was employed for predicting the cd <dig> promoter region. promoter  <dig>  predicts transcription start sites of vertebrate polii promoters in dna sequences. it can also be used to predict transcription factors that bind to the sequences in promoter regions, based on the theorems that are common to neural networks and genetic algorithms . as first exon of the cd <dig> gene begins on  <dig> , atgtcgcggc, a  <dig> bp sequence at the 5' upstream of the transcription start site  was analyzed by promoter  <dig>  prediction. the sequence of the putative promoter region of the gene is embedded at position - <dig> bp upstream of the tss . to determine the minimal promoter region, the  <dig>  kb genomic sequence was subcloned in pgl <dig> basic upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. these 5'-deleted constructs pgl <dig> p <dig>  pgl <dig> p <dig>  pgl <dig> p <dig>  pgl <dig> p <dig>  pgl <dig> p <dig> , pgl <dig> p <dig>  pgl <dig>  <dig> and pgl <dig>  <dig> were transfected to hct <dig>  as shown in figure 1b. the primers amplifying the corresponding fragments were as shown in methods. renilla luciferase was used for normalization of firefly luciferase expression. the highest activity appeared in p <dig>  in which the length of promoter is from - <dig> upstream of the tss . p <dig> showed a lower level of activation than p <dig>  however, balancing their length, p <dig> was recognized as the minimal promoter region for the cd <dig> gene . deletion of the region from p <dig> to p <dig> resulted in a 75% reduction in basal promoter activity. these data suggested the existence of a minimal promoter region within the sequence -258/ <dig>  p <dig> activity was analyzed in different cell lines including k <dig>  hct <dig>  ht <dig> and sw <dig>  of which hct <dig> showed the highest p <dig> activity .

the sequence of the putative promoter region of the gene is embedded at position - <dig> bp upstream of tss

in silico prediction of minimal promoter regions
the putative minimal promoter regions p <dig>  were analyzed with tfbind , a software program for searching transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . the p <dig> sequence contains two ap-1-like binding sites which are located at - <dig> bps  and - <dig> bps  upstream of the tss, respectively . the results are shown in table  <dig> 

ap-1-like binding sites  were found

effects of c-jun and hif-1alpha on the p <dig> minimal promoter activity
c-jun is a proto-oncogene. its expression has been studied in many tumour types  <cit> . c-jun, in combination with c-fos, forms the ap- <dig> early response transcription factor. in order to determine the effect of the potential effects of c-jun on minimal promoter p <dig> activity, we co-transfected hct <dig> cells and sw <dig> cells with pcmv-c-jun or pcmv- <dig> empty vector and reporter vector pgl <dig> p <dig>  the c-jun was able to increase the minimal promoter activity by about 50% in both cell lines . the upregulation of cd <dig> by c-jun at mrna level was observed using real-time pcr . to investigate whether the ap-1-like motifs play roles in cd <dig> gene expression, the wild-type pgl <dig> p <dig> construct or its mutants  as shown in figure 2b, were transfected into hct <dig> cells. in hct <dig> cells, the activities of p4ap- <dig> amu and p4ap- <dig>  both mu mutants, were reduced by about 40% compared to pgl3p <dig> wild-type . in contrast, there was no significant change of activity in p4ap- <dig> bmu  compared to pgl3p <dig> wild-type. significant difference  between p4ap- <dig> amu and p4ap- <dig> bmu showed the location of different responses to endogenous transcription factors. the distal ap-1-like motif which overlapped with hif-1alpha binding sequence in the promoter was essential for cd <dig> transcription. the responses of ap-1-like motif to exogenous c-jun were tested by co-transfected pcmv-c-jun construct and the mutants. the mutants, especially p4ap- <dig> amu and p4ap- <dig> both mu, resulted in decreased activities compared to the wild-type. these data suggested that the ap-1-like motif is one of the main elements in the cd <dig> gene promoter. p4ap- <dig> bmu, after treatment with exogenous c-jun showed significantly different promoter activity, compared to the control. it seemed that ap-1-like site in - <dig>  was more sensitive to exogenous c-jun than endogenous stimulatory factors.

tfbind also identified several other transcription factors which contain putative binding sites for transcription factors, several of which exactly match or are very similar to those already known, like the ap-1-like sites described above. it also revealed the presence of one hif-1alpha motif  overlapping e-box  and distal ap-1-like binding sites . to investigate the contribution of this e-box to the activity of the p <dig> region, constructs with mutation the e-box in the promoter region were subcloned into the pgl3-basic plasmids and used to transfect the hct <dig> cells. for the normalized luciferase activity, a significant decrease of luciferase activity was found in the p <dig> containing e-box mutation compared to the hct <dig> cells transfected with wild-type p <dig> . to determine whether hif-1alpha mediates the increased activity of pgl3p <dig> in hct <dig> cells, co-transfection of a hif-1alpha plasmid with pgl3p <dig> was performed. co-transfection of a hif-1alpha expressing plasmid with pgl3p <dig> resulted in a significant increase in the promoter activity . to investigate the effect of hif-1alpha through hif-1alpha/e-box overlapping sequence, the pcdna <dig> - hif-1alpha was co-transfection with pgl3p <dig> containing e-box mutation. for the normalized luciferase activity, a significant decrease of luciferase activity was found in the co-transfection with pgl3p <dig> containing e-box mutation compared to the hct <dig> cells co-transfected with wild-type pgl3p <dig> . it demonstrated that hif-1alpha/e-box/ap-1-like sequences is crucial cis-regulatory elements of cd <dig> expression.

hypoxia exists in the microenvironment of solid tumours and stem cells. in the present study, in vitro hypoxia treatment was carried out to examine if hypoxia mediates cd <dig> expression. the promoter activity was determined under hypoxic conditions and pgl3p <dig> plasmids were transiently transfected into the hct <dig> cells. the cells were cultured in dmem without serum for  <dig> hours, then transferred into gas-exchange chambers maintained at 37°c with 1% po <dig> 

binding of hif-1alpha to pgl3p <dig> minimal promoter sequence
in order to confirm the binding of hif-1alpha to the promoter of cd <dig>  chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay was performed. we transfected hif-1alpha plasmid to the hct <dig> cells. the anti-hif-1alpha was used to precipitate protein/chromatin complexes from sonicated samples. the complexes were then processed to dna amplification. as shown in figure 4d, it demonstrated the binding of hif-1alpha to the minimal region of promoter of cd <dig> 

discussion
a cis-regulatory element is a region of dna or rna near a gene required for proper spatiotemporal expression of that gene, often containing binding sites for transcription factors. the mechanisms by which cd <dig> expression is activated have been defined in this study. the different lengths of 5'-deleted mutant constructs of the cd <dig> showed different luciferase activities. the luciferase activities reached their peak in p <dig> which was  <dig> bps upstream of the transcription star site and was 70-fold greater than that of the control group. the luciferase activity assays also indicated that the cd <dig> promoter had relative cell specificity, as its ability to activate luciferase was different in hct <dig>  k <dig>  ht <dig> and sw <dig> cells. the pgl3p <dig> promoter had a proximal region of approximate  <dig> bases that increased the promoter activity by more than 50-fold and was recognized as the most effective promoter when compared to their sizes.

from the in silico analysis, the overlapping hif-1alpha/e-box/ap-1-like sequences was found in the minimal region of cd <dig> promoter. c-jun and hypoxia upregulated the expression of cd <dig>  mutation of the overlapping sites resulted in reduced expression of cd <dig>  two ap-1-like sites  on this proximal promoter region, of which distal site located in the overlapping sites, were identified by the in silico analysis. the consensus ap- <dig>  recognition sequence is tgactca but many variations of this sequence  were found in the promoter regions of target genes, including tyrosine hydroxylase  <cit> , prodynorphin  <cit> , proenkephalin  <cit>  and glial fibrillary acidic protein  <cit> . two putative ap-1-like sites in the cd <dig> gene pgl3p <dig> segment were found in the present study by bioinformatic analyses. the ap- <dig> transcription factor is a dimeric complex, and correlates with multi-stage tumor development, including tumor cell proliferation  <cit> ; apoptosis  <cit> ; tumor invasion and angiogenesis  <cit> . the main ap- <dig> proteins in mammalian cells are jun and fos. endogenous and exogenous transcription factors influence the cd <dig> expression by binding to ap-1-like sites. in the condition without exogenous factors, the distal ap-1-like site, located at - <dig>  which was supposed to bind endogenous factors including c-jun, may play a major role, as mutation of this site induced a 40% decrease of cd <dig> basal expression in hct <dig> cells, whereas no significant effect was found by mutating the proximal ap-1-like site. therefore, the distal ap-1-like site which is overlapped with hif-1alpha/e-box sequence plays a more important role than the proximal ap-1-like site, which is located at - <dig> for endogenous factors. however, the proximal ap-1-like site was sensitive to exogenous c-jun it is likely that the cd <dig> expression in hct <dig> cells is also controlled by both exogenous and endogenous factors through ap-1-like sites. cd <dig> may be a target gene in the ap- <dig> pathway and plays crucial roles in tumor development.

a number of studies have suggested that normal stem cells reside in "niches," which support and maintain the undifferentiated phenotype of the stem cells. these niches may be hypoxic and hypoxia may play roles in maintaining the stem cell phenotype. under hypoxia, hifs regulate a variety of pro-angiogenic and pro-glycolysis pathways. in solid cancers, regions of hypoxia are commonly present throughout the tissue. in this study, hypoxia treatment and the transfection of hif-1alpha induced the expression of cd <dig>  our results and previous studies showed that eight hours of treatment in a hypoxia chamber resulted in the highest level of hif-1alpha expression. the chip showed the binding of hif-1alpha to the promoter of cd <dig>  it demonstrated that the hypoxic treatment upregulated the expression of cd <dig> through hif-1alpha binding the promoter of cd <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results presented here have confirmed cis-regulatory functions of overlapping hif-1alpha/e-box/ap-1-like sequences of minimal promoter region of cd <dig>  the research performed in this paper represents the combination of in silico biology and molecular biology. the elucidation of the cis-regulatory elements is useful in understanding cd <dig> functions in cancer cells.
