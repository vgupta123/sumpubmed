BACKGROUND
in multicellular organisms, developmental processes must coordinate cytoskeletal dynamics and morphogenesis with cell proliferation. for example, microtubule mediated trafficking and cell motility are inhibited during mitosis since centrosome and mitotic spindle mediated chromosome segregation requires dramatic reorganization of microtubules. in addition, actin/myosin mediated cell migration ceases during cell division when cortical actin must be reorganized in order to specify where the cleavage furrow is activated during cytokinesis. consequently, gene expression patterns that control differentiation, morphogenesis and cell division must respond to a myriad of developmental cues and integrate them into a concerted cellular response in order to achieve proper tissue size and shape .

it is also thought that changes in chromatin structure accompany developmental changes in order to establish and/or maintain tissue specific gene expression states  <cit> . how changes in chromatin are coordinated with cell division and cell differentiation remains poorly understood. however, it is clear that these processes must be linked in order to ensure accurate propagation of epigenetic states and maintenance of cell fates  <cit> . as these are fundamental processes ubiquitous to all metazoans, it is of great interest to uncover the factors that link cell cycle progression, differentiation and morphogenesis to developmental changes in chromatin.

drosophila development, and oogenesis in particular, has proven to be an excellent model for understanding how developmental cues coordinate differentiation with cell cycle progression  <cit> . the drosophila model has recently been used to reveal novel epigenetic functions of sticky and the fragile-x mental retardation- <dig>  gene  <cit> . furthermore, both genes have been shown to regulate actin/myosin cytoskeletal organization and mutants in both genes exhibit pleiotropy. these findings suggest that sticky and dfmr <dig> may possess similar biological functions and may represent regulatory hubs that coordinate diverse cellular and developmental processes. if this is true, it would be expected that both of these genes would have many interactors as it has been suggested that pleiotropy may result from disrupting hubs in protein-protein interaction networks as well as in gene regulatory networks  <cit> .

sticky is the drosophila homologue of mammalian citron kinase. it is related to protein kinase b, protein kinase c, rho-kinase , myotonic dystrophy protein kinase  and myotonin-related cdc42-binding kinase   <cit>  . the only known substrate for citron kinase is myosin ii, the primary motor protein responsible for cleavage furrow ingression during cytokinesis  <cit> ). although it is clear that sticky/citron kinase plays a critical function in cytokinesis, this kinase has other functions as it likely has more than one substrate. in addition, it may possess activities not dependent upon its kinase domain. citron kinase deficient mice exhibit cytokinesis failure and increased apoptosis in the central nervous system resulting in severe ataxia and epilepsy. however, some non-neuronal cells develop normally  <cit> . normal development of non-neuronal cells suggests that, in mice, citron kinase has a neuron specific function. in a down syndrome mouse model citron kinase is responsible for inhibiting neurite extension  <cit> . interestingly, this citron kinase mediated neurite inhibition is through a direct interaction with tetratricopeptide repeat protein ttc <dig>  the ortholog of drosophila dtpr <dig>  which suppresses polyglutamine toxicity in a fly huntington's disease model  <cit> . further support for a neuro-specific function comes from the observation that a splice variant of citron kinase protein, which lacks the kinase domain, directly interacts with post-synaptic density protein  <dig>  and localizes to synapses  <cit> .

the fragile-x mental retardation- <dig> protein  is a microrna regulator, and like citron kinase protein, fmrp is thought to have critical functions in neurodevelopment  <cit> . inactivation of the human fmr <dig> ortholog leads to fragile-x syndrome, which is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and is associated with severe neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities . fmrp is an rna binding protein, and its molecular function is thought to be in regulating mrna translation and mrna trafficking in neurons. interestingly, in drosophila, dfmr <dig> has also been shown to regulate heterochromatin mediated gene silencing  <cit> . therefore, it is clear that fmrp is capable of affecting the expression of many genes, some of which produce mrna molecules that are direct binding targets of the fmrp protein while others may be targets of fmrp chromatin mediated epigenetic gene regulation  <cit> . both sticky and dfmr <dig> have been shown to genetically interact with the microrna regulator ago <dig>  further supporting a connection between these genes in translational and epigenetic control of gene expression  <cit> .

fmrp also regulates actin/myosin cytoskeletal dynamics through the rac <dig> gtpase  <cit> . similarly, in both drosophila and mouse, sticky  is regulated by rho and rac gtpase activities  <cit> . this raises the interesting possibility that both citron kinase protein and fmrp could regulate actin/myosin cytoskeletal dynamics via a common signaling pathway. given the phenotypic and genetic similarities between the drosophila sticky and dfmr <dig> genes, we first investigated whether mutations in these two genes exhibited a genetic interaction. secondly, we assessed whether both mutants had a common suite of genes that were misregulated that could account for the similarities between sticky and dfmr <dig> mutant phenotypes.

in this report, we show that the drosophila citron kinase ortholog, sticky, exhibits a genetic interaction with dfmr <dig>  and we show that sticky and dfmr <dig> regulate a common set of genes. these findings have important implications for the functions of both citron kinase protein and fmrp in human neurodevelopment as well as human pathologies including down syndrome and fragile-x syndrome.

RESULTS
sticky mutants dominantly suppress dfmr <dig> gain of function rough eye phenotype
we have previously shown that an argonaute <dig>  gain of function phenotype can be dominantly suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in sticky  <cit> . this observation suggested that wild-type ago <dig> protein function was dependent on proper sticky dosage . fmrp, like ago <dig>  is a regulator of microrna mediated gene silencing  <cit> . in addition, drosophila dfmr <dig> mutants have been shown to have heterochromatin structure and gene silencing defects similar to those reported for sticky mutants  <cit> . therefore, we tested whether sticky genetically interacts with dfmr <dig> 

two different sticky alleles, sti <dig> and stiz3- <dig>  were crossed to a sev:dfmr <dig> strain where dfmr <dig> is being overexpressed specifically in the eye under the sevenless gene enhancer  <cit> . as previously reported the sev:dfmr <dig> eyes were rough . at higher magnification the sev:dfmr <dig> eye showed that 100%  had > <dig> ommatidia with crater-like necrosis . both sti <dig> and stiz3- <dig> mutant alleles were able to dominantly suppress the dfmr <dig> gain-of-function rough eye phenotypes yielding a less severe rough eye . although the degree of suppression was variable, it occurred in 100% of progeny . furthermore, the crater-like necrosis of the individual ommatidia was almost completely suppressed as all  eyes we observed at high magnification had < <dig> of these defects per eye . we conclude that fmrp function is sensitive to sticky gene dosage. this also suggests that, in part, fmrp effector functions are sticky dependent, and therefore we propose that sticky may function upstream of fmrp . however, since the rac-gtpase may be positively or negatively regulated by fmrp  <cit> , it is also possible that fmrp activity modulates sticky through rac activation or rac mrna translational repression .

loss of dfmr <dig> function enhances sticky knockdown phenotypes in the eye
the ability of sticky mutations to rescue dfmr <dig> overexpression suggests positive regulation between these genes. in a model such as this , it would be predicted that a loss of function in both genes would result in phenotype enhancement. it has previously been shown that rnai knockdown of sticky, under control of the eyeless promoter, results in a rough eye phenotype and a reduction in eye size  <cit> . we have used this system to demonstrate that loss of function in dfmr <dig> can enhance the phenotypes caused by sticky rnai knockdown in the fly eye .

flies containing an eyeless-gal <dig> driver were crossed to a line containing a uas-sticky-rnai construct. this resulted in rough and reduced eyes in many of the progeny. we also observed a strong effect on the bristles that border the eye as well as a variety of low frequency phenotypes including complete loss of the eye, reduced or missing maxillary palps, and necrotic ommatidia. we crossed the ey-gal4; uas-sticky-rnai lines to uas-dfmr1-rnai lines and to dfmr <dig> mutants. in both cases, reducing the function of dfmr <dig> enhanced the phenotypes caused by sticky rnai knockdown. in the cases of rough eyes, reduced eyes, vibrissae, and postorbital bristles, the phenotypes caused by sticky knockdown were significantly enhanced by both dfmr <dig> knockdown and a dfmr <dig> loss of function allele . when the ey-gal <dig> driver was used to express the dfmr <dig> rnai construct alone, no phenotypes were observed .

sticky and dfmr <dig> regulate a common set of genes
sticky and dfmr <dig> genetically interact and share a common set of genetic interactors such as ago <dig>  rac-gtpase and possibly others . since mutations in the sticky and dfmr <dig> genes have been demonstrated to affect chromatin structure, we also hypothesized that regulation of gene expression by sticky kinase and/or fmrp could occur at the level of transcription and therefore mrna levels would be altered in each of these mutants. to assess which specific transcripts were being regulated by these genes, we used nimblegen drosophila whole genome arrays containing ~ <dig>  features  to measure the levels of  <dig>  specific transcripts in cy <dig> labeled cdna made from whole female fly total rna. due to the number of measurements per gene, we were able to identify a large set of misexpressed genes with high significance.

expression array data obtained from three biological replicates of each mutant were compared to a pooled set of two biological replicates for each of two independent wild-type controls . one wild-type control was oregon-r. the second wild-type control was from a stock made in a w <dig> background, homozygous for dfmr <dig>  and also carried a fully functional wild-type dfmr <dig> transgene that rescued the dfmr <dig> mutant phenotypes. therefore, this second control stock had a genetic background identical to that of the dfmr <dig> mutant. this served to reduce the chance of identifying genes which showed different transcript abundance due to genetic background differences. the use of two independent wild type controls also served to reduce the chance of detecting transcripts which may have large natural variances in abundance but do not dramatically impact phenotype. adult female flies from control stocks were grown and aged under identical conditions as the mutants.

we observed that sti3/stiz3- <dig> females had  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes misexpressed with a false discovery rate of q <  <dig>  and q <  <dig> , respectively . similarly, dfmr13/dfmr <dig> females had  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes misexpressed with q <  <dig>  and q <  <dig> , respectively . strikingly, a comparison of these two sets revealed a highly significant overlap . with the more stringent q-value threshold,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed on both lists. this is significantly greater than the number one would expect to find by chance . each of these  <dig> genes showed a change in the same direction in both mutants . with the more relaxed threshold of q <  <dig> ,  <dig> genes are common to both lists  with  <dig> of these genes  commonly up-regulated in the mutants .

to assess the validity of these findings we used semi-quantitative rt-pcr to measure the abundance of  <dig> different transcripts that were enriched in both mutants. we confirmed that  <dig> of  <dig> genes are indeed being overexpressed in sticky mutants and  <dig> of  <dig> genes were upregulated in dfmr <dig> mutants . though the cbl-l transcript signal appeared to be higher in the dfmr <dig> mutant than in the wild-type control, we could not conclude that this difference was statistically significant. this may be because cbl-l is expressed at very low levels in all genotypes and our assay was simply not sensitive enough to detect such a small difference. regardless, this rt-pcr validation provides general evidence that sticky and dfmr <dig> both serve to normally repress a common set of genes, and these data suggest that a large number of similar processes may be affected by both sticky and dfmr <dig> 

sticky kinase and fmrp regulate a common set of biological processes
though the analyses described above demonstrate that many genes are commonly regulated by sticky kinase and fmrp with a high degree of statistical significance, the biological significance of this regulation was not evident from the gene lists alone. to overcome this problem we associated our expression data with a network of drosophila protein-protein interactions. transcriptional regulation is only one of many levels of regulation found in biology. though microarrays do not directly provide data on other types of regulation, the effects of transcriptional changes on other levels of biological regulation can be inferred based on additional information. for example, if a gene does not show a change in transcript abundance but nevertheless interacts with a number of genes that show significant expression changes, it is likely that its functionality will be altered. thus, we used protein-protein interaction data to expand the scope of our microarray analysis. after associating our microarray gene expression data set with a protein-protein interaction network , we used jactivemodules to identify and score sub-networks of interacting genes that collectively showed significant changes in expression  <cit> .

for each mutant expression data set the highest scoring sub-networks revealed several interesting features . first, we observed that for both mutants, the mer, ci and apkc genes emerge as common hubs for the two sub-networks even though none of these genes are being misexpressed in either mutant . as noted above, this is due to many of the same genes that are being misexpressed in both mutants. second, we found that although both sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants generally tend to overexpress genes , the dfmr <dig> sub-network shows many more underexpressed genes than the sticky sub-network . third, although the dfmr <dig> sub-network shows many more underexpressed genes than the sticky sub-network these are not necessarily genes that are misregulated only in the dfmr <dig> mutant. for example, the dna repair genes, irbp and pms <dig>  are overexpressed in sticky mutants whereas both are underexpressed in dfmr <dig> mutants . similarly, the autophagy-specific gene  <dig> kinase, atg <dig>  gene is overexpressed in sticky mutants whereas it is underexpressed in dfmr <dig> mutants . lastly, although dna damage response and repair genes are common in both sub-networks, we noted that different subsets of these genes are misexpressed in each of the two mutants. for example, the lig <dig> and mus <dig> genes are present in the sticky sub-network but not the dfmr <dig> sub-network, whereas the recq, mus <dig> and mus <dig> genes emerge from the dfmr <dig> sub-network and not observed in the sticky sub-network. this suggests that although both mutants may impinge on similar biological processes by altering expression of similar sets of genes, the mechanism by which sticky and dfmr <dig> effect these same processes may be different. in the case of these dna repair genes, it will be interesting to see whether these differences in the two sub-networks reflect physiologically different types of dna damage and/or repair processes.

as a quantitative measurement, we used the genes within these sub-networks to identify significantly overrepresented gene ontology terms . several common go-terms were overrepresented in the highest scoring sub-networks for both sticky and dfmr <dig> mutant gene expression patterns. these go-terms included many related to embryonic and larval development, nervous system development, oogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, axis specification, cell cycle regulation, and dna damage responses . many of these processes fit well with our current understanding of the in vivo functions of these two genes yet some suggest novel functions. for example, according to our analysis "cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis" is altered in both sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants. this is consistent with previous reports in the literature. intriguingly, our go-term analysis predicts disruptions in oocyte and embryonic axis specification and dna repair, two processes that have not been reported to be affected in either sticky or dfmr <dig> mutants.

as a control for this analysis, we compared gene expression in our two different wild-type control strains. we observed  <dig> and  <dig> genes  to be differentially expressed between these two strains. these expression changes were integrated with our protein-protein interaction network and used to identify significantly altered genetic modules. the highest scoring sub-network did not possess any informative go-terms which were significantly over-represented .

as a further test of the significance of this go-term analysis, we randomized the microarray data sets by randomly reassigning gene names to the microarray gene expression p-values , and we asked whether these would yield any specifically enriched go-terms that were also found in the non-randomized data set. we found that the sticky mutant randomized expression data set produced no significantly enriched go-terms . by contrast, the dfmr <dig> mutant randomized data set did yield a small number of significantly enriched go-terms, such as "rna-pol ii transcription" and "transcriptional regulation" . this may represent bias that is inherent to our protein-protein interaction network.

sticky and dfmr <dig> regulate genes with similar tissue specificity
the go-terms found to be over-represented in the identified sub-networks  suggested some misexpression may have been tissue specific. however, since our rna was prepared from whole adult flies, it was not possible to directly determine which tissues were misexpressing which genes. in order to address this issue we compared our data to the flyatlas dataset  <cit> . this data set compares gene expression profiles between individual drosophila tissues. however, the criteria used to define tissue specific genes in chintapalli et al. were as strict as possible  and resulted in small lists of tissue specific genes. we wished to determine larger sets of "tissue enriched" genes from flyatlas that could be more robustly compared to our microarray data. therefore, we defined our own sets of "tissue enriched" genes  based on the ratio of gene expression in a given tissue to that of the whole fly, as reported in  <cit> . we were then able to calculate the probability of observing a given amount of overlap between sets.

by comparing our misexpression lists with tissue enrichment lists derived from flyatlas, we observed both significant over- and under-representation of tissue enriched genes. we found that genes enriched in the head, midgut, malphigian tubules, larval tubules, and larval fatbody were significantly over-represented in the lists of misexpressed genes for both sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants  . hindgut enriched genes were also highly represented on both lists though this was just shy of significance for dfmr <dig> misexpressed genes. we also found that genes enriched in ovaries and testes were under-represented in both the sticky and dfmr <dig> misexpression sets though the significance of this varied based on which q-value cutoff was used . the under-representation of testes enriched genes was expected since we used female total rna. however, under-representation of ovary specific genes was surprising since nearly half the rna of mature adult females comes from ovaries, and this could have biased our analysis toward ovary enriched genes. alternatively, sticky and dfmr <dig> could regulate genes that are not particularly abundant in ovaries but nevertheless have critical ovary specific functions, and therefore give rise to tissue specific phenotypes.

sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants exhibit predicted oocyte polarity defect
in order to validate some go-term analysis predictions we turned again to the sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants. go-term analysis predicted that the sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants may exhibit an oocyte axis polarity defect . this hypothesis was further supported by the common misexpression of the cbl gene , which encodes for a receptor tyrosine kinase-associated, e <dig> ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . the cbl protein attenuates egfr signaling, which is a major receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway in the developing ovary  <cit> . furthermore, fmrp has been shown to directly bind the cbl mrna, possibly regulating its stability and translation, thus adding an additional level of regulation to cbl gene expression  <cit> . disruption of egfr signaling during oogenesis can lead to oocyte polarity defects  <cit> , and thus overexpression of cbl could potentially lead to polarity defects by inappropriately dampening egfr signaling  <cit> . alternatively, sticky is known to phosphorylate the drosophila myosin ii light chain, spaghetti squash , in order to promote cytokinesis  <cit> . although genetic mosaic studies have demonstrated that loss of sqh function leads to oocyte dorsal/ventral axis polarity defects  <cit> , it is not known whether sticky kinase is the effector kinase that regulates myosin ii in a non-cytokinesis context such as oocyte axis determination.

we examined stage  <dig> oocytes in sti3/stiz3- <dig> females and observed that 35% of oocytes were indeed ventralized, whereas the sti3/+ sibling heterozygous controls had normal oocytes . the variability in severity of oocyte ventralization is likely due to the fact that the stiz3- <dig> mutation is not a complete loss-of-function  <cit> . interestingly, the severity of this phenotype was temperature sensitive , also consistent with our previous report demonstrating that the temperature sensitivity of the stiz3- <dig> mutant allele  <cit> . similarly, stage  <dig> oocytes from dfmr13/dfmr <dig> mutant females were also severely ventralized, whereas a sibling heterozygous dfmr13/+ had normal oocytes . this oocyte ventralization defect suggests that localization of axis determining factors requires sticky kinase and fmrp function and/or that cbl overexpression in the ovary can lead to polarity defects. in either case, we conclude that the polarity defects predicted by the go-term analysis are valid, and this points to clear and testable mechanistic models of sticky and dfmr <dig> function in drosophila oocyte axis formation.

CONCLUSIONS
mutations in drosophila sticky and dfmr <dig> both result in a wide variety of phenotypes associated with many cell types and cellular processes. we believe many of these diverse phenotypes are caused by effects on the populations of a wide range of transcripts, either through transcriptional regulation or mrna stability. genes that function to regulate such a diverse array of processes can be resistant to characterization by traditional genetic methods. this is because pleiotropic effects make it difficult to infer function from phenotypes. thus, we have used a combination of genomic and protein-protein interaction network analyses in order to compare the effects of mutations in sticky and dfmr <dig>  we have found that these two genes function to negatively regulate a large number of common transcripts and that their targets are involved in a number of similar biological processes. it is noteworthy that this interpretation is also supported by previous reports that both sticky kinase and fmrp are regulators of chromatin mediated epigenetic gene silencing. it has been shown that fmrp is required for centric heterochromatin assembly during embryogenesis  <cit> . it has also been shown that sticky wild-type gene function is required for proper silencing of genes by heterochromatin  <cit> . therefore, the finding that both mutants display overexpression of many genes is consistent with genetic evidence demonstrating their general gene silencing functions.

based on our analyses, we predict that sticky and dfmr <dig> both function to control many aspects of development in imaginal disc derived appendages, oocytes, neurons, and possibly other tissues. surprisingly, other biological processes that have not previously been associated with either gene are also predicted to be perturbed in sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants. for example, a number of genes functioning in dna damage repair such as dna pol delta, irbp, ligase  <dig>  mei- <dig>  mre <dig>  mlh <dig>  mus <dig>  mus <dig>  mus <dig>  pms <dig> and tefu, among others, are revealed in the high scoring sub-networks of either one or both mutants . we have validated at least one go-analysis prediction by showing that sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants indeed exhibit an oocyte axis polarity defect . interestingly, drosophila mutants in dna repair functions, including mei- <dig>  disrupt receptor tyrosine kinase  signaling and results in oocyte polarity defects  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the sticky and dfmr <dig> mutant oocyte polarity defects could be due to failure to repair meiotic or germline chromosomal breaks.

lastly, it is also noteworthy that the drosophila merlin  gene, the ortholog of the human tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis- <dig>  emerged as a major hub for both sticky and dfmr <dig> active sub-networks . this is important because the mer protein serves to anchor actin to transmembrane proteins and is critical for establishing oocyte axis polarity  <cit> . it remains to be tested whether dna damage repair, cbl mediated attenuation of egfr signaling, or actin/myosin defects is the primary cause of this axis polarity mutant phenotype. in addition, it remains to be tested whether other predictions from these analyses are correct.

our claims of overlapping functions for the sticky and dfmr <dig> genes are supported by the demonstration of a genetic interaction and phenotypic similarities. the phenotypes that we observe in these mutants also serve to validate our computational predictions about the functions of these genes. genes that regulate many biological processes also tend to exhibit pleiotropic effects, leading to multiple and seemingly unrelated phenotypes. as is the case with many other proteins that function as hubs within biological networks, understanding the molecular mechanisms through which sticky kinase and fmrp affect any cellular process is complicated by the very fact that they impinge on many other regulatory molecules. the idea that mutations with pleiotropic effects are common to genes whose products have many protein-protein interactions is supported by a recent study of yeast pleiotropic genes  <cit> . though few direct targets of fmrp are known, and sticky kinase has only one known phosphorylation target, our expression data suggest these genes may nevertheless be hubs in the gene expression network . in addition, the great number of genes that are transcriptionally misregulated in both dfmr <dig> and sticky loss-of-function mutations could also explain pleiotropic effects  <cit> . our systems level analysis of gene expression patterns in sticky and dfmr <dig> mutants has revealed gene networks, and potential direct downstream targets, that are regulated by both sticky kinase and fmrp. it is our hope the future studies that seek to identify the molecular mechanisms causing the myriad phenotypes presented in these mutants may be facilitated by the gene networks reported in this study and the multiple testable hypotheses that arise from them, for example the predicted function of sticky kinase and fmrp in cell polarity and dna damage repair.
