BACKGROUND
that bmp signalling controls many essential processes in eye development is evidenced by the fact that disruptions in bmp signalling in many model organisms result in morphologically small or misshapen eyes which have underlying defects in histology and/or neurogenesis  <cit> . bmp's are expressed in morphogenetic gradients throughout the developing embryo. bmp signalling is modulated by bmp antagonists which heterodimerize with bmp's and inhibit binding to their receptors. initially neural induction occurs in an environment where bmp signalling is blocked by bmp antagonists that are secreted from the spemann organizer  <cit> . however bmp's are later expressed in neural tissue and are found to promote cns development  <cit> . tissues respond differently to different levels of bmp signalling. dpp, the drosophila homolog of bmp <dig>  operates at different thresholds within the neuroectoderm to either inhibit neurogenesis or promote dorsal fates  <cit> . within neural tissues, bmp's have been found to have roles in a wide range of processes such as dorsal-ventral patterning, regulating cell division, apoptosis and setting up axon guidance cues  <cit> .

gradients of bmp's and bmp antagonists establish dorsal-ventral characteristics within both the neural tube and retina, which develop as bilateral evaginations from the neural tube. in the neural tube many bmp's are expressed dorsally at the roof plate and control region-specific expression of transcription factors that are involved in specification of dorsal and ventral types of neurons  <cit> . in xenopus overexpression of bmp <dig> in the retina causes expansion of dorsal retina markers, while overexpression of its antagonist noggin causes expansion of ventral retina markers  <cit> . antagonistic relationships between bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and the antagonist ventroptin in chick retina establish proper expression of axon guidance molecules  <cit> .

bmp signalling in the eye is important for the establishment of domains of pax <dig> and pax <dig> which demarcate the optic cup and optic stalk respectively  <cit> . pax <dig> is one of the earliest markers expressed in the eye field  <cit>  and plays a key role in maintaining multipotency of neuronal cells  <cit> . bmp <dig> expressed dorsally and sonic hedgehog  expressed ventrally have opposing effects on proximal-distal and dorsal-ventral properties of the developing retina impacting on pax <dig> and pax <dig>  <cit> .

growth and differentiation factors  are a subgroup within the bone morphogenetic proteins. gdf's are able to heterodimerize with bmp's and signal through the same smads as bmp's  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis places gdf <dig>  into a subgroup, that also contains gdf <dig> and gdf <dig>   <cit> , which are involved in development of joints and cartilage  <cit> . gdf <dig> was shown to promote differentiation of a discrete class of dorsal interneurons in mouse  <cit> . the zebrafish homolog to gdf <dig>  radar, was shown to have a role in maintenance of neuroectodermal identity  <cit> .

gdf <dig> expression in xenopus as well as the homolog radar in zebrafish have been described  <cit> . in xenopus neurulation gdf <dig> is expressed at the edges of the neural plate, within the anterior neural plate and eye fields. after neural tube closure gdf <dig> is expressed in the neural tube and retina expression becomes restricted to the dorsal side. the conserved expression pattern of gdf <dig> in xenopus and zebrafish eye development suggests a conserved developmental function in this tissue. we wished to further investigate the role of gdf <dig> in neural development and specifically within the retina in xenopus. at late blastula – early gastrula stages of development, xenopus gdf <dig> has a very restricted expression compared with bmps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  gdf <dig> expression initially is completely restricted to the animal cap ectoderm, and remains ectodermal throughout development  <cit> , whereas bmp <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> all have wider expression patterns which include mesoderm  <cit> . thus we have a unique opportunity with gdf <dig> to address the role of bmp signalling specifically in ectoderm/neural tissue.

here we demonstrate that loss of function experiments by morpholino antisense knockdown resulted in reduced expression of a phosphorylated form of smad in the developing eye. our gdf <dig> knock down resulted in neurulation defects in the eye as well as the neural tube, with an underlying loss of pax <dig> and ncam expression. loss of gdf <dig> also resulted in increased cell death pointing to a role for gdf <dig> in retinogenesis that is attributable to a promotion of cell survival during neural differentiation.

RESULTS
reduced eye size following gdf <dig> depletion
to test whether gdf <dig> has a role in eye development, we designed a morpholino against the atg site of xenopus gdf <dig>  embryo halves depleted of gdf <dig> showed a striking reduction in eye size compared to the uninjected side when assessed at stage  <dig>  a time when the major events in eye development are relatively complete . on average, eye size decreased by 16%–34%. mo treatment had a dose dependent effect on eye size with 22% of embryos displaying the phenotype at the lower  <dig> ng dose compared to 65% of embryos displaying small eyes at the  <dig> ng dose . a standard mo  had no significant effect on eye size even at the highest mo dose injected .

in addition to the injection of the std mo as a control for toxicity, we took a number of approaches to verify the specificity of our morpholino. firstly, in vitro, the gdf <dig> mo specifically and efficiently blocked translation of its target mrna, while the std mo had no effect . one way to demonstrate in vivo specificity is to rescue the mo induced phenotype by coinjecting mrna for the target gene. it was not possible to produce a convincing rescue of the small eye phenotype by co-injecting gdf <dig> mrna nor the zebrafish homolog radar mrna along with the gdf <dig> mo. the results from these experiments were difficult to interpret since both gdf <dig> mrna and radar mrna overexpression caused an overall ventralized phenotype in which the eyes could be small due to either ventralization or the gdf <dig> mo knock down. this type of rescue experiment is further complicated by the fact that the coinjected mrna would have effects much earlier and ubiquitously compared with the endogenous gdf <dig>  as an alternative we took advantage of the ventralization effect of the injected gdf <dig> mrna, and rescued this by coinjection of the gdf <dig> mo . gdf <dig> mrna over expression ventralizes embryos, a phenotype that was efficiently rescued by co-injecting gdf <dig> mo, highlighting the specificity of this mo's activity . 95%  of embryos injected with  <dig> pg gdf <dig> mrna were ventralized with dai values of 1– <dig> . co-injection of  <dig> pg gdf <dig> mrna with  <dig> ng gdf <dig> mo resulted in only 20%  of embryos being ventralized and all had less severe dai values of 3– <dig> . the remaining 80% of embryos had a normal axis .

our third approach for verifying the specificity of our gdf <dig> mo knock down was to detect a loss in bmp signalling in vivo. studies have shown that treatment of cells with recombinant gdf <dig> activated the smad <dig> , <dig> pathway as evidenced by phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> detection  <cit> . analysis of phosho-smad staining in xenopus by whole mount immunohistochemistry has shown a particularly strong expression in the retina and neural tube from neurulation onwards  <cit> . analysis of phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> in embryo halves injected with gdf <dig> mo showed a marked reduction in phospho-smad staining , compared to the uninjected half . in embryos injected with  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng gdf <dig> mo there was a loss of stain intensity in the retina for phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> on the injected side in 30%  and 57%  of embryos respectively. physically the eye appeared normal in that the lateral bulge was visible even though the stain was reduced in intensity. the reduced intensity of phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> was more evident on the dorsal side of the retina, fitting with the dorsal-high expression of gdf <dig> by in situ hybridization  <cit> . in addition we noted a reduction in stain intensity within the neural tube on the injected side, also a site of gdf <dig> expression  <cit>  . no loss of phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> staining was observed in the retina when  <dig> ng standard morpholino was injected  . the phospho-smad antibody used specifically detects the expected  <dig> kda band of endogenous phospho-smad in gastrula stage embryonic extracts . this band was not detected in earlier embryonic extracts where bmp signalling is not yet active .

we have provided evidence that our gdf <dig> mo is able to block both in vitro translation and in vivo translation of gdf <dig> mrna. that our gdf <dig> mo also blocks endogenous gdf <dig> mrna in vivo is strongly supported by the reduction in signalling through phospho-smad1/5/ <dig>  together these results show that the small eye phenotype induced by injection of gdf <dig> mo is caused by depletion of gdf <dig> and gdf <dig> mediated bmp signalling.

loss of retinal differentiation and laminar structure in gdf <dig> depleted embryos
histological examination of the small eye phenotype by dapi staining revealed that the organization of nuclear layers in normal retina  was completely lost in the small eyes . we investigated whether the retinal neurons normally present in the differentiated retina were present in the disorganized retinas of the gdf <dig> knock down tadpoles by staining for photoreceptors and ganglion and amacrine cells. we found that the small eyes were negative for the photoreceptor marker xap- <dig> . we did note that cell bodies in the outer layer of the neural retina appeared to extend outward like photoreceptors, even though they did not stain for xap- <dig>  these extensions might represent an attempt to form photoreceptor cells, however they are not stained for xap <dig> which only detects properly assembled outer segment membranes  <cit> . the anti-islet- <dig> antibody which detects ganglion and amacrine cells did not detect any of these cells within the small eye .

to determine the degree of neural differentiation within the small retinas, we stained for the ncam cytoplasmic domain which stains the nerve fibres within the retina. the small eyes showed only small patches of ncam staining , demonstrating that they contained very few mature neurons. at stage  <dig> the xenopus retina is differentiated, except for the cillary marginal zone  regions where undifferentiated cells are still mitotically active. using phospho-histone h <dig> as a mitotic marker, we found normal control retinas to contain only one or two positively stained cells per section, which always occurred within the cmz . in the small eyes we found some mitotic cells outside the rpe, but there was no sign of massive increased proliferation within the small eyes. this demonstrated that while the cells in the small retinas did not appear to be mature neurons, in general most of the cells within the retina of the small eyes were post mitotic, but had not differentiated into specific retinal cell types.

gdf <dig> knock down disrupts pax6
pax <dig> is a key regulator of eye development which is expressed early in eye development when the brain first evaginates to form optic vesicles  <cit> . since xenopus gdf <dig> is also expressed in the eye fields at stage  <dig>  <cit> , we tested whether loss of gdf <dig> expression disrupted pax <dig>  in stage  <dig> embryos knock down of gdf <dig> caused a reduction in the size and altered the shape of the pax <dig> domain in the retina and forebrain on the gdf <dig> mo injected side compared with the uninjected side or control mo injected side . the distinction between the forebrain and retina domain is lost and the retina stain does not extend as far laterally . pax <dig> staining within the brain was also disrupted with a loss of the two rhombomeric bands of stain within the hindbrain . the number of embryos with disrupted pax <dig> expression within the stage  <dig> eye field following injection of gdf <dig> mo was similar at  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng but the  <dig> ng injections produced a more severe effect, with increasingly reduced pax <dig> domains in the retina/forebrain as well as along the neural tube . in addition, at  <dig> ng the injected side of the embryo appears to show an overall reduction in size. gdf <dig> depleted embryos continued to show defects in pax <dig> staining later in development  with a reduced area or change in shape of pax <dig> staining within the retina and a marked loss of pax <dig> in the forebrain . interestingly, while pax <dig> staining was disrupted in gdf <dig> depleted embryos at both stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> only specific areas of pax <dig> staining were affected indicating discreet regions of pax <dig> are responsive to/dependent on gdf <dig> signalling. furthermore, we did not observe a decreased intensity in pax <dig>  but rather a complete loss of stain in specific areas. where pax <dig> staining remained, such as the more proximal retina stain at stage  <dig>  and parts of the retina at stage  <dig>  staining remained quite intense, indicating an all or nothing response to gdf <dig> depletion.

gdf <dig> knock down disrupts neural differentiation
since we detected a loss of mature neurons in the developing retina of gdf <dig> depleted embryos, using an antibody to ncam which specifically stains neurons with axons, we extended this analysis of neuronal differentiation from neurula to early tailbud stages. we observed a decrease in intensity of ncam staining in 72–100% of stage 24– <dig> embryos injected with  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng of gdf <dig> mo . at  <dig> ng gdf <dig> mo there was a marked loss of ncam staining along the neural tube, within the brain and retina . within the brain and retina, ncam staining appeared patchy, whereas the posterior neural tube ncam staining was reduced uniformly. at the lower dose,  <dig> ng gdf <dig> mo, loss of ncam within the neural tube and the brain was comparatively more severe than loss of ncam within the retina . a less severe patchy loss of ncam was detected following  <dig> ng injections as compared to the  <dig> ng dose . in embryos injected with  <dig> ng gdf <dig> mo we found variation in the degree of ncam reduction in the posterior neural tube. in some cases ncam loss was confined to the posterior neural tube and in others ncam was reduced along the entire neural tube .

increased cell death during neurogenesis in gdf <dig> depleted embryos
the pattern of loss of patches of pax <dig> and ncam stain suggested either a loss of maintenance of expression of these factors or cell death within these tissues. using tunel staining we found that the injected side of stage 20– <dig> embryos had increased cell death compared to the uninjected side of the same embryo . when stage 20– <dig> embryos were analyzed, increased tunel staining was found in 34% and 35% more embryos than with standard mo injections in which we observed some background levels of increased tunel staining. tunel staining mainly occurred adjacent to the midline and in the anterior region, coinciding with areas where pcd naturally occurs during xenopus neurulation  <cit> . we detected a dose dependent increase in tunel positive cells following treatment with gdf <dig> mo. the number of tunel positive cells increased and the area of tunel staining was widened and extended posteriorly at the highest mo dose  . at  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng 26% and 35% respectively had increased tunel staining above background. the pattern of increased tunel at stage  <dig> was an intense patch within the brain adjacent to the retina and within the retina . interestingly, this pattern resembles the areas of patchy ncam staining in stage 24– <dig> embryos injected with gdf <dig> mo . we noted that the injected side of the embryos were frequently physically smaller compared with the uninjected side  or curled towards the injected side  which is consistent with a loss of tissue by cell death.

discussion
gdf <dig> in the context of bmp signalling in eye development
while it had been shown that treatment of cells with recombinant gdf <dig> lead to phosphorylation of smad1/5/ <dig> we have shown the first evidence of gdf <dig> signalling through smad proteins in vivo. gdf <dig> knockdown lead to a decrease in p-smad1/5/ <dig> in the eye, neural tube and branchial arches. more specifically, in the developing retina, gdf <dig> depletion resulted in a specific loss of phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> in the dorsal retina, an area where gdf <dig> is expressed, demonstrating that gdf <dig> has a role in maintaining bmp signalling in the dorsal optic vesicle.

in keeping with the expression of gdf <dig> within the retina we found that knock down of gdf <dig> lead to a striking small eye phenotype. micropthalmia is also associated with bmp <dig> heterozygote mice, a gene that is also expressed in xenopus developing retina  <cit> . while mouse bmp <dig> expression is restricted to the rpe and lens, bmp <dig> knockout mice display a gobal eye developmental defect manifesting as small eyes and anophthalmia  <cit> . additionally these studies now implicate gdf <dig>  in eye development.

our histological analysis on the gdf <dig> morpholino induced small eyes showed a marked reduction in ncam and other retinal neural markers. while we have not conclusively identified the nature of the retinal cells in gdf <dig> knockdown embryos or whether they are post mitotic or not, the loss of ncam and other retinal markers coupled with the increased proportion of retinal cells that were undergoing mitosis outside the cmz, demonstrated that the overall level of terminal differentiation within the small retinas and brain were inhibited. manipulation of expression of bmp receptors in mouse has shown that bmp signalling has a role in neural differentiation  <cit> . this effect may also be mediated through downstream genes, such as pax <dig>  which maintains multipotency of retinal progenitor cells  <cit> . if gdf <dig> knock down initially reduces the pax <dig> field, this could reduce the ability of the retina to differentiate into the various neural cell types. although both gdf <dig> and pax <dig> expression occupy the entire eye field in a relatively uniform manner at stage  <dig> we observed only partial loss of pax <dig> staining at stage  <dig> which correlated to the more lateral region. it is possible that other bmp's can compensate for loss of gdf <dig> in the more medial region of the eye field. overexpression of bmp <dig> and the bmp antagonist noggin increase and decrease the domains of pax <dig> expression respectively  <cit> .

gdf <dig>  neural differentiation and cell death
while it is well established that neural induction initially requires blockage of bmp signalling by bmp antagonists  <cit> , much work in mamamalian systems has established that later bmp signalling has a positive role in neural development  <cit> . during neurulation gdf <dig> expression coincides with many regions of active bmp signalling as detected by phospho-smad1/5/ <dig> particularly in the neural tube and retina  <cit> . the restricted expression of gdf <dig> to the neuroectoderm allowed us to address the role of bmp signalling in this tissue. we propose that gdf <dig> has a positive role in neural differentiation within the retina and neural tube and that this may be separate from the epidermal inducing activity that is essential during neural induction. it is likely that heterodimerization between gdf <dig> and other bmp's such as bmp <dig> set up temporally and spatially regulated gradients of bmp signalling in neural tissues including the eye.

ncam is needed for the proper histogenesis of the retina, and since ncam staining was reduced from early stages of eye development in gdf <dig> morpholino injected embryos, the abnormal laminar organization that we observed could be directly due to a reduction of ncam  <cit> . fitting with the increased cell death that we found in the ncam domain, an ncam-like molecule was found to be protective against apoptosis in neurons  <cit> . there is some evidence that bmp's can positively regulate cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . the loss of ncam that we observed more likely demonstrates an inability of neurons to differentiate properly since our ncam antibody detects ncam in neurons with axons. in support of this, gdf <dig>  bmp <dig> and gdf <dig>  each promotes neurite outgrowth when added to retinal ganglion cells in culture  <cit> .

in many organisms including xenopus, developmentally important pcd takes place in actively proliferating neural precursors and new postmitotic neuroblasts  <cit> . in xenopus, during neurulation pcd has very specific patterns within the brain and sensory placodes and within the neural folds  <cit> . much of this pcd appears to occur at the level of neuronal determination  <cit> . it is becoming clear that some of the same factors that regulate neural development actually regulate pcd  <cit> . our data are consistent with gdf <dig> fitting into this category, as a factor which protects against cell death and also promotes neural differentiation.

a direct link between bmp signalling and apoptosis has not yet been made, however bmp signalling has generally been shown both to promote and inhibit apoptosis in different contexts. in the optic cup of chick, bmp <dig> and its antagonist noggin have shown pro and anti-apoptotic effects respectively  <cit> . it has been shown that bmp <dig> acts to promote survival of newly formed olfactory neurons  <cit> . in mice bmpr1b knock out leads to cell death in the retina postnatally at the end of neurogenesis  <cit> . in conditional double knock outs of bmpr1a and bmpr1b in the retina of mice, at retinal neurogenesis stage, there is a marked increase in cell death  <cit> .

phenotypes described for zebrafish hapoid for a deletion of the radar gene include short axis and reduction in head structures  <cit> . in addition it was noted that the eyes initially formed but degenerated later, likely due to apoptosis. we similarly observed an increase in apoptosis in the eyes during development however we cannot determine whether the eyes of our gdf <dig> depleted xenopus embryos grow initially but then later degenerate. in either case, since reduction of gdf <dig> and haploinsufficiency of zebrafish radar both result in increased cell death in the eye, gdf6/radar appears to be protective against apoptosis in the retina.

gdf <dig> may act through pax <dig> to regulate cell death. pax <dig> mutation is associated with abnormal cell death patterns during development and in differentiation of neurons  <cit> . decreased expression of pax <dig> is associated with apoptotic regression of eyes in the cave dwelling eyeless form of the teleost, astyanax mexicanus compared with its surface dwelling form which has eyes  <cit> . further studies have shown that shh and tiggy-winkle hedgehog  gene expression is expanded along the anterior embryonic midline in the cave dwellers and when over-expressed in the surface dwellers, can mimic the eye regression phenotype  <cit> . perhaps gdf <dig> acts in a similar way to bmp <dig> in opposing shh to establish proximal-distal and dorsal-ventral properties of the developing retina and in regulating pax <dig> and pax <dig> domains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we propose that gdf <dig> is an important early regulator of vertebrate retinal development and likely acts through pax <dig> to regulate eye development and subsequently retinal differentiation. this hypothesis is supported by the following points:  gdf <dig> is normally expressed in the developing retina,  loss of gdf <dig> function reduces eye size,  loss of gdf <dig> function disrupts expression of pax <dig>   loss of gdf <dig> function leads to reduced neural differentiation as determined by ncam expression and reduced retinal differentiation as determined by loss of differentiated retinal cell types. our results suggest that gdf <dig> may function through regulation of cell death. loss of gdf <dig> may lead directly to increased cell death within the neuroectoderm pool of neuronal precursors, resulting in less cells differentiating to neurons. alternatively, loss of gdf <dig> leads to a loss of neuronal identity of cells within the neuroectoderm, leading to increased cell death in cells lacking proper determination factors.
