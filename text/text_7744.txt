BACKGROUND
the flexibility of protein structures is often related to protein function. some proteins alter their tertiary  structures due to a change of surroundings or as a result of interaction with other proteins  <cit> . for instance, the gtp-binding proteins adopt an active conformation when binding with gtp, and shift to inactive conformation when gtp is hydrolyzed to gdp  <cit> . motor proteins shift their structure among multiple conformations  <cit> , while many carrier proteins embedded in a membrane transport small molecules by executing structural changes  <cit> . in short, the structural flexibility that allows shifting between two or more structures is a crucial characteristic for numerous proteins that are involved in many pathways  <cit> . although proteins can shift structure among several conformations, some of their segments, referred to as conserved domains, preserve the structure in all of the conformations  <cit> . in fact, many proteins that can change their conformations can be divided into the rigid  region and the flexible region, in some cases referred to as linkers, which serve to link and adjust the relative location of the conserved domains. upon the arrival of an external signal, such as a change in surroundings or a binding of another molecule/protein, the flexible region allows the protein to respond by changing its conformation. in other words, the flexible linker is essential for a protein to maintain flexibility and the corresponding function  <cit> .

additionally, the flexible linker and the rigid domain should be factored in when performing 3d protein structure prediction. protein is a complex system that can be described by an accurate energy-based model  <cit> . however, due to the large numbers of atoms involved in the protein folding, and the resulting large amount of calculations, protein structures cannot be directly calculated  based on the existing mechanical models employed by current supercomputers. a natural solution to this problem is to apply a divide-and-conquer approach, in which a large protein is divided into several structurally conserved domains, and each of the domains is predicted separately  <cit> . a number of methods can be used for the prediction of protein domains  <cit> . at the same time, the remaining  protein regions that are located between domain borders may be flexible, and knowledge of their flexibility would be beneficial to accurately predict the overall tertiary structure.

the knowledge of the flexible/rigid regions would also allow us to gain insights into the process of protein folding. biological experiments and theoretical calculation have shown that the natural conformation of proteins is usually associated with the minimum of the free energy  <cit> . however, the overall process that leads to the final, stable conformation is still largely unknown. udgaonkar and baldwin propose a framework model for protein folding  <cit> . their theory states that peptides of about  <dig> amino acids  firstly fold into helices and strands, and then these secondary structures are assembled together to form the molecule. the hydrophobic collapse model proposed by gutin and colleagues assumes the initial condensation of hydrophobic elements that gives rise to compact states without secondary structures. the development of native-like tertiary interactions in the compact states prompts the subsequent formation of the stable secondary structures  <cit> . a recent paper by sadqui and colleagues shows the detailed process of the unfolding of the downhill protein bbl from escherichia coli, atom by atom, starting from a defined 3d structure  <cit> . however, the detailed process of folding of most proteins is still under investigation. the proteins with flexible 3d-structures may provide some hints since the conserved regions should fold separately from the flexible regions to eventually get linked into a stable  structure.

gerstein's group has done a significant amount of work on the related subject of classification of protein motions  <cit> . they proposed two basic mechanisms of protein motion, hinge and shear, which depend on whether or not a continuously maintained interface  is preserved through the protein's motion. the shear mechanism is a kind of a small, sliding motion in which a protein preserves a well-packed interface. in contrast, hinge motion is not constrained by maintaining the interface, and this motion usually occurs in proteins with domains connected by linkers. they also defined other possible motions, and among them those that involve a partial refolding of a protein and thus result in significant changes in the overall protein structure. this paper does not study protein motion. instead, we aim at finding protein-sequence regions that are flexible and hence which constitute the interface between the rigid regions. in our recent work, we performed a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of the conservation of protein structures stored in pdb, and we found three distinct types of the flexible regions, namely rotating, missing, and disarranging  <cit> . the rotating region of a protein sequence is related to the hinge motion, i.e., it usually contains a linker which is located between two domains. on the other hand, the missing and disarranging regions correspond to the types of motions that involve a partial refolding. the missing region is associated with changes in the local, secondary structure conformations, which may also lead to different tertiary structures. for instance, given two structures that share the same sequence, some regions of one structure may form a helix or a strand, while the same regions in the other structure may form an irregular coil. for the disarranging region, the overall 3d conformations of two identical underlying sequences are similar, but the packing of the residues is spatially shifted  in some fragments of the region. we illustrate each of these three types of regions in figure  <dig> 

since the regions that are missing a secondary structure are characterized by relatively small changes in the overall tertiary structure  <cit> , in this paper we associate the flexibility of the protein structures with the two other types of flexible regions. our aim is to perform prediction of the flexible regions using machine-learning methods that take as an input a feature based representation generated from the primary sequence. several other research groups addressed similar prediction tasks, including prediction of regions undergoing conformational changes  <cit> , prediction of intrinsically unstructured regions  <cit>  and prediction of functionally flexible regions  <cit> . however, these contributions have different underlying goals, use different definitions of "flexible" regions , and apply different prediction models. our goal is to classify each residue as belonging to either a flexible or a rigid region. the quality of the prediction is evaluated on a carefully designed  set of  <dig> proteins using the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and matthews correlation coefficient  measures and an out-of-sample cross-validation test procedure. the methods section provides further details on the definition of the flexible regions and situates it with respect to the related research.

RESULTS
feature-based sequence representation
four groups of features were compared, and the best set was selected to perform the prediction. the composition vector, binary encoding and psi-blast profile representations are widely used in protein structure prediction including the structural class prediction, the secondary structure prediction and the cis/trans isomerization prediction. however, since these features were not designed for the prediction of flexible/rigid regions, a new representation, which is based on frequencies of k-spaced residue pairs, was proposed and compared with the other three representations. due to a relatively large number of features, the binary encoding and the proposed representation were processed by two feature selection methods, which compute linear correlation and information gain based on entropy between each of the features and the predicted variable, i.e., rigidity/flexibility of the residues. the selection was performed using 10-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting. only the features that were selected by a given method in all  <dig> folds were kept. while in general each of the two methods selects a different set of features, among the best  <dig> features selected by the entropy based method,  <dig> were also selected by the linear correlation based method.

using the 10-fold cross validation, the proposed flexrp method, which applies logistic regression and the proposed collocation based representation, which is processed using entropy based feature selection, was compared with four other prediction methods, i.e., support vector machines , c <dig> , ib <dig> and naïve bayes, which apply each of the four representations and two selection methods, see table  <dig>  the selected methods cover the major categories of machine learning algorithms, i.e., kernel methods, probabilistic methods, instance based learning and decision trees.

the proposed flexrp method obtained the best,  <dig> % accuracy, when compared with the other four methods, four representation and application of the two feature selection methods. the results for the two worst performing prediction methods, i.e., c <dig>  and ib <dig>  show relatively little differences in accuracy when the two feature selection methods are compared. on the other hand, results for the three best performing methods  show that using the entropy based feature selection results in the best accuracy of prediction when the proposed  representation is used. the results achieved by the proposed method are 1% and  <dig> % better than two runner-up results achieved for the same representation and the svm and naïve bayes classifiers, respectively. the results that apply other combinations of feature representations and selection methods are on average, over the three best methods, at least 4% less accurate. therefore, entropy based selection not only reduces the dimensionality of the proposed representation, making it easier to implement and execute the method, but also results in improved accuracy. the superiority of the entropy based selection over the linear correlation based method can be explained by the type of features that constitute the proposed representation. the features take on discrete, integer values, and thus linear correlation coefficients, which prefer continuous values, are characterized by poorer performance.

among the four sequence representations, the lowest average  accuracy is achieved with the composition vector, while both psi-blast profile and binary encoding give similar, second-best accuracies. the most accurate predictions are obtained with the proposed representation. since the psi-blast profile is one of the most commonly used representations, we also combined it with the features of the k-spaced aa pairs to verify whether this combination could bring further improvements. the corresponding experiments with the best performing three classifiers, i.e., flexrp, naïve bayes and svm, show that using both representations in tandem lowers the accuracy. the 10-fold cross validation accuracy equals  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for flexrp, svm, and naïve bayes, respectively. finally, similar experiments that combine all four representations show a further drop in accuracy. the proposed, k-spaced residues based representation not only gives the best accuracy but it also uses the least number of features when compared to representations that combine multiple feature sets, and therefore this representation was used to perform the predictions.

a set of features used by the flexrp method, which were selected using the best performing, entropy based selection method from the proposed representation, is given in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> features were selected. they correspond to threshold ig >  <dig> , which gives the highest prediction accuracy for flexrp and svm. when varying the threshold to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , the corresponding accuracies for flexrp are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, and for the svm are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. although this set of features may seem disordered, some interesting patterns can be found. for instance, the "ll" was selected as the 0-, 1-, 2- and 4-spaced aa pair, since leucine has a strong tendency to form helices  <cit> , and thus this pair may be characteristic for the rigid regions. the k-spaced "vi" pair is characteristic to formation of strands  <cit> , and thus it may also be associated with the rigid regions. the k-spaced "gg" pair could indicate flexible regions since glycine has a very small side chain  and is shown to be mainly associated with coils  <cit> . at the same time, to the best of our knowledge, some of the other pairs cannot be currently explained. in general, the flexibility/rigidity of individual k-spaced pairs is associated with the arrangement of the corresponding side chains in 3d structure and their quality is supported by the relatively high accuracy of the methods that use this representation. we also performed a test, in which we accept all features that are selected in at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> cross-validation folds to investigate if inclusions of additional features can improve the results. the corresponding feature sets gave slightly lower accuracies. for the proposed representation, the corresponding accuracies dropped to  <dig> % for svm and to  <dig> % for flexrp.

optimization of the prediction of the flexible/rigid regions
the accuracies of the optimized prediction methods equal  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the flexrp, naïve bayes and svm, respectively. to provide a more comprehensive comparison of the achieved performance, additional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, the matthews correlation coefficient  and the confusion matrix values  are reported in table  <dig>  which lists 10-fold cross validation results for the three methods.

the optimization provides relatively marginal improvements. flexrp method gives the best overall accuracy and high sensitivity and specificity for the rigid regions. svm provides the best sensitivity for the rigid regions and the best specificity for the flexible regions, while naïve bayes gives the highest mcc and the highest sensitivity for the flexible regions. in summary, the proposed flexrp method is shown to provide the most accurate prediction of flexible/rigid regions; however, naïve bayes based method provides more accurate prediction for the flexible regions.

additionally, we studied the impact of the varying values of the maximal spread, k, of the k-spaced aa pairs that are used to represent protein sequences on the prediction accuracy of the three optimized prediction methods. the accuracy in function of p for the k-spaced aa pairs where k ≤ p and p =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  the results show that accuracy increases steadily for p between  <dig> and  <dig>  and saturates above the latter value. the best accuracy corresponds to p =  <dig> and is achieved by the flexrp, while on average, over the three methods, the accuracy for p =  <dig> equals  <dig> %, and for p =  <dig> and  <dig> is higher and equals  <dig> %. therefore, the proposed sequence representation includes features for p =  <dig> .

comparison with similar prediction methods
the flexrp was also compared with two recent methods that address similar predictions. boden's group developed a method to predict regions that undergo conformational change via predicted continuum secondary structure  <cit> . on the other hand, the iupred method performs prediction of intrinsically disordered/unstructured regions based on estimated energy content  <cit> . we note that although the above two methods perform similar prediction tasks, the definition of the flexible regions defined in this paper is different. both of the above methods were tested on the same data as the flexrp method and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  a direct comparison between accuracies may not be fair; however, low values of mcc for both iupred and boden's method in comparison with the mcc value for the flexrp indicate that the proposed method is better suited for the prediction of flexible regions, as defined in this paper. the iupred in general struggles with prediction of flexible regions, i.e., low sensitivity shows that it classifies a low number of the actual flexible residues as flexible, and low specificity shows that it classifies a relatively large number of the rigid residues as flexible, while doing relatively well in the case of prediction of the rigid regions. on the other hand, boden's method is better balanced between the flexible and the rigid regions but it still overpredicts the flexible regions, i.e., it achieves low specificity for the flexible regions. the flexrp method obtains relatively good predictions for both flexible and rigid regions.

we use an example to further demonstrate differences between the three prediction methods. the prediction was performed for a segment between 11e and 216a in chain a of 1eul protein, see figure  <dig>  the continuum secondary structure is predicted by a cascaded probabilistic neural network   <cit> , and the threshold to distinguish between the flexible and rigid residues is set to  <dig> . the iupred method uses a probabilistic score ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> , which is based on an energy value calculated using a pairwise energy profile along the sequence. this method uses a threshold that equals  <dig>  to distinguish the disorder and ordered regions. similar to the iupred, the flexrp method computes a probabilistic score that ranges between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and uses a threshold that equals  <dig> .

in figure  <dig>  the actual  flexible regions are identified by the white background. boden's method captures flexibility in all three flexible regions, but it also predicts over 50% of this sequence as flexible. this method performs prediction based on the entropy of the predicted secondary structure, and thus the quality of the predicted secondary structure determines the prediction of a flexible region. if cpnn is used with a sequence that shares low homology with the sequences that were used to train this neural network, then the resulting entropy may possibly have relatively large values, and as a result the corresponding residues will be classified as flexible . therefore, a large value of entropy may be related to the actual flexibility, or can be an artifact of a training set that does not include sufficiently homologous sequences. iupred method generates scores that form local maxima around the first and the third flexible regions. however, the threshold is too high to identify them as disordered regions. we believe that this method could provide better prediction if a suitable optimization of the threshold value for a given sequence would be performed. at the same time, such optimization was not attempted in this method and may prove difficult to perform. finally, the flexrp method provides successful prediction of the first and the third flexible regions but it still misses the second, short flexible region that consists of  <dig> residues.

CONCLUSIONS
knowledge of flexibility/rigidity of protein sequence segments is of a pivotal role to improve the quality of the tertiary structure prediction methods and to attempt to fully solve the mystery of the protein folding process. at the same time, such information requires a very detailed knowledge of protein structure, and thus is available only for a small number of proteins. to this end, we propose a novel method, called flexrp, for prediction of flexible/rigid regions based on protein sequence. the method is designed and tested using a set of segments for which flexibility/rigidity is defined based on a comprehensive exploration of tertiary structures from pdb  <cit> . it uses a novel protein sequence representation, which is based on  <dig> features computed as a frequency of selected k-spaced aa pairs, and a logistic regression classifier. based on out-of-sample, 10-fold cross validation tests, the flexrp is shown to predict the flexible/rigid regions with 80% accuracy, which may find practical applications. finally, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate when compared with four other machine learning based approaches and two recently proposed methods that address similar prediction tasks.
