BACKGROUND
the isolation of brucella from marine mammals and the classical biotyping of these strains were first reported in  <dig> coincidently in two locations. ross et al.   <cit>  reported the isolation of brucella from tissues collected post mortem from stranded marine mammals including common seal , harbour porpoise  and common dolphin  around the coast of scotland whilst ewalt et al.   <cit>  reported the recovery of the organism from an aborted foetus of a bottlenose dolphin  in the usa. the isolation of brucella has since been described from a wide variety of marine mammals including atlantic white-sided dolphin , striped dolphin , hooded seal , grey seal , european otter   <cit> , pacific harbour seal   <cit> , minke whale   <cit>  and white beaked dolphin   <cit> .

although the number of isolations of brucella strains from marine mammals are still relatively limited, there is strong serological evidence that such infections are widespread, in prevalence, in the variety of species infected and in their geographical distribution. evidence arising from the northern hemisphere is particularly well documented from locations such as the scottish coast  <cit> , the coasts of england and wales  <cit> , the north atlantic ocean, west of iceland to the north of norway and russia  <cit> , the mediterranean sea  <cit> , arctic canada and the atlantic coast of north america  <cit> . evidence from the southern hemisphere is less well documented although there are reports of positive serological results from baleen whales  from the western north pacific  <cit> , hawaiian monk seals  from the northwestern hawaiian islands  <cit> , bottlenose dolphins from the solomon islands  <cit> , cetaceans living off the peruvian coast  <cit>  and seals from antarctica  <cit>  and australia  <cit> .

for many years, the accepted taxonomy of brucella comprised six species: b. abortus, b. melitensis, b. suis, b. ovis, b. canis and b. neotomae, some of which are further divided into biovars. the attribution to species is usually made using classical biotyping techniques to identify phenotypic characteristics such as co <dig> dependency, substrate utilisation, dye and antibiotic susceptibility, phage lysis, and serotyping  <cit> . such phenotypic species classification relates closely to host preference and therefore this system of classification has assisted in the study of brucella and remains widely used today for epidemiological purposes. dna-dna hybridization studies have demonstrated that brucella is a highly homogeneous genus   <cit> . nevertheless, the development of a range of dna based typing techniques  <cit>  have supplemented the classical techniques and show remarkable correlation with the classical brucella species.

much attention has been focussed on attempts to classify the marine brucella strains in a way consistent with the framework of the existing six species. studies using classical biotyping methods revealed characteristics which were typical of the genus brucella  <cit>  but the pattern of which differed from those displayed by the currently recognised species  <cit> . in particular, the oxidative metabolism tests have allowed the differentiation of a number of distinct marine specific phenotypes  <cit> . such studies resulted in a number of tentative proposals to define the brucella isolated from marine mammals as separate species  <cit>  and much additional investigation has been completed in an attempt to differentiate the strains and gain insight to their evolutionary relationship with the existing recognised species. a number of early studies were carried out using classical biotyping, pcr-rflp of the omp2a gene  <cit> , pulsed field gel electrophoresis   <cit>  and is <dig> fingerprinting  <cit> .

recently, following analysis of a small number of strains, two new species names, brucella ceti and brucella pinnipedialis were validly published for isolates from cetaceans and pinnipeds respectively  <cit> . nevertheless, the current status of the classification of brucella isolated from marine mammals remains controversial with molecular evidence suggesting that b ceti comprises two genetic clusters  <cit> . this study aims to characterise brucella isolates from a range of marine mammals originating from various geographical locations using a selection of widely recognised classical and molecular techniques in direct comparison. the data generated may assist in resolving some of these taxonomic issues and gives the most extensive description to date of the characteristics of this group of isolates.

RESULTS
a comparative summary of the results of characterisation of all  <dig> isolates by both phenotypic and molecular approaches is provided in table  <dig> 

molecular characterisation
pcr-rflp of omp genes
analysis of the  <dig> isolates examined in this study generated six unique profiles. of the six profiles m was the most common being present in 53/ <dig> isolates. this profile was predominantly associated with porpoises  but was also less frequently seen in dolphins , seals  and whales . of the remaining five profiles, n was exclusively associated with dolphins while profiles l and o were predominantly associated with seals . two less commonly observed profiles, p and q, were seen only in hooded seal isolates and in a single isolate from a bottlenose dolphin respectively.

is <dig> fingerprinting
is <dig> fingerprinting analysis of the  <dig> isolates generated  <dig> unique marine-specific is <dig> profiles of which  <dig> were observed amongst the european strains and four amongst the usa strains. all fingerprints comprised more than  <dig> bands and examples of each profile are shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution of is <dig> copies in the genomes of all of the marine strains included in this study showed little resemblance to any pattern previously observed in any other species or biovars, including those of b. ovis or b. suis bv  <dig> which themselves have many copies of the element. clustering of the  <dig> fingerprints divided them into  <dig> groups  when using a cut-off value of >85% similarity. members of cluster  <dig> were isolates predominantly associated with seals possessing omp pattern l or o. members of cluster  <dig> were isolates predominantly associated with porpoises possessing omp pattern m. members of cluster  <dig> were isolates of omp pattern n exclusively associated with dolphins. cluster  <dig> isolates, representing omp pattern p, were associated only with hooded seals.

irs-derivative pcr
the isr-derivative pcr examines the presence/absence of four distinct pcr fragments in isolates. positive results for pcrs ii and iii were always congruent with each other and with is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig>  comprising of predominantly porpoise isolates. pcr iv was positive only in the group exclusively associated with dolphins corresponding to is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig>  pcr i appeared to be specific for strains predominantly originating from seals . four isolates repeatedly failed to provide a product with any of the pcrs. these were  <dig> isolates from is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig> all originating from the usa and a single hooded seal isolate from the uk.

phenotypic characterisation
classical bacteriological biotyping techniques to identify phenotypic characteristics have traditionally been used to classify brucella strains. although these techniques have proved useful, they are subjective and it is well recognised that some strains may give unexpected or anomalous results to some or all of the tests.

co <dig> requirement
in this study, isolates originating from seals  in general showed a requirement for co <dig> for growth whereas isolates from cetaceans  generally did not. however several exceptions were observed .

agglutination with a and m monospecific antisera
serotyping with a and m monospecific antisera is very subjective and it is well recognised that apparently anomalous results are observed. in addition, strains converting to the rough phenotype on subculture may lose the characteristic. the majority of isolates were a dominant only but some strains agglutinated both a and m antisera. these strains did not correspond to a single molecular type, but were distributed throughout the molecular groups discussed above. none of the isolates originating from the usa agglutinated with either the a or m monospecific serum .

phage lysis
smooth brucella strains are lysed by specific phages, and the pattern of lysis is an important characteristic which has been used to classify terrestrial strains, although the characteristic may be lost if the strains become rough on subculture. phage lysis results among the panel examined here were very variable with no clear patterns correlating to the groups identified by the various molecular typing methods. the majority of isolates  were lysed by phage bk <dig> and of the isolates that showed any lytic activity only three isolates  from is <dig> fingerprinting clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were not lysed by this phage. sixty six  of isolates were lysed by wb phage, forty-eight  were lysed by fi phage and eleven  of isolates were lysed by tb phage. a total of six isolates all originating from is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig> showed no lysis by any of the phages.

dye sensitivity
the vast majority of isolates were not inhibited by basic fuchsin or thionin. a few isolates of is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig> were inhibited by both fuchsin and thionin  or only by fuchsin .

discussion
data from a large comparative analysis of molecular and phenotypic characteristics of marine mammal brucella is presented here. the  <dig> strains included in this study are derived from the north atlantic from locations around the coasts of the uk, france, spain, germany, and norway. although they are predominantly european in origin a small number of north american isolates are also included in this study and two from the pacific ocean. wherever serological surveys have been carried out, a high prevalence has been found in pacific waters  <cit> . in addition, a strain isolated from a human brucellosis case in new zealand gave test results indistinguishable from one of the marine mammal strains  included in this study originating from a bottlenose dolphin from the usa  <cit> . recent analysis of two further historical cases of severe human brucellosis originating in peru  <cit>  also revealed that both associated isolates share the same genotype  <cit> . these findings indicate that marine mammal brucella isolates may also be common in parts of the world where little data has yet been reported. until recently molecular evidence suggested that brucella originating from marine mammals from the pacific ocean all belonged to b. pinnipedialis  <cit> . however, a recent report provides evidence that strains belonging to b. ceti are present  <cit> . this report is also corroborated by our own studies .

when considered in full, the data obtained in this study reveals a remarkable congruence between groups identified by different molecular tests and with the order and/or species of marine mammal from which they originated. these relationships are depicted graphically in figure  <dig>  thus, when considering is <dig> fingerprints, four main clusters were identified. within the numerically largest of these clusters, cluster  <dig>  all isolates possess omp pcr-rflp pattern m, and display the irs-pcr profile - + + -. the vast majority of these strains originate from harbour porpoises. in contrast members of is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig> all possess omp pcr-rflp profile n and irs-pcr profile - - - +. without exception these isolates originate from dolphins. thus cetacean isolates appear to fall into two well-separated clusters with different preferred hosts that are consistently apparent using different molecular approaches. these isolates correspond to the newly described species b. ceti.

isolates that are members of is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig> correspond to two main omp pcr-rflp profiles l and o. the vast majority of these isolates possess irs-pcr profile + - - -, although three isolates within this group, originating from the atlantic coast of the usa, reacted with none of the irs-pcr primer sets . a single isolate also possesses a unique omp pcr-rflp profile q. members of this is <dig> fingerprinting cluster were predominantly isolated from seals and correspond to the recently described b. pinnipedialis. three isolates obtained from hooded seals comprised is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig>  these three isolates also possess a unique omp pcr-rflp profile p and, as with members of is <dig> fingerprinting cluster  <dig> possess irs-pcr profiles + - - - or - - - -.

thus, the overall finding of four groups identified using a cut-off value of >85% similarity to define is <dig> fingerprinting clusters is consistent with other molecular tests and with host preferences observed in this study. furthermore, the grouping of strains in this study is consistent with other recent studies. studies based on genome mapping recently divided marine mammal brucella strains into three major groups  <cit> . strains originating from seals fell into one group , with a single hooded seal isolate placed within this group, although possessing a variant profile. as in this study isolates from cetaceans fell into two distinct groups comprising isolates from common and striped dolphins  and isolates predominantly from harbour porpoises . the authors of this article suggested that, given the large branch lengths between the three groups, they could be classified as separate species. moreover, a recent comparative study using variable-number-of tandem-repeats  analysis and multilocus sequence analysis  divides strains into the same three groups  <cit> . this study identified congruent vntr and mlsa groups corresponding to isolates with preferred hosts of dolphins, porpoises and seals. furthermore, within the seal group isolates from hooded seals formed a subgroup, as seen in this study, and isolate  <dig>  corresponding to the isolate with a distinct omp pcr-rlp profile, was found to represent a unique sequence type and form a separate sub-branch within the group based on vntr clustering. while agreeing with the validity of a species group comprising of seal isolates and now classified as b. pinnipedialis, the authors of this manuscript questioned the validity of the group since published as b. ceti. this was based on the clear division into two groups with distinct host specificities that appeared less closely related to each other than either was to the group of seal isolates now classified as b. pinnipedialis.

while there was clear division into consistent groups based on molecular typing in combination with apparent host preferences there was little evidence of any consistent phenotypic traits based on the conventional biotyping procedures usually applied to brucella. although classical bacteriological typing has been universally used for identifying and characterising brucella strains isolated from terrestrial mammals, the results obtained in this study were disappointing. it is well recognised that such methods require considerable skill and expertise and correctly standardised reagents to carry out, that their interpretation is somewhat subjective, and that anomalous results are not uncommon. however, the results of phage lysis, sensitivity to dyes and agglutination with monospecific sera showed no evidence of any grouping patterns that corresponded to host of origin or the molecular groups described above. the results observed in this study suggest that these tests offer little value in the characterisation of marine mammal strains. the strongest correlation was with the requirement of co <dig> for growth. in general, isolates derived from seals required additional co <dig> for growth, but isolates from cetaceans did not, although there were exceptions. this is in agreement with the observations of foster et al.   <cit>  in the description of b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis. however, a number of other characteristics outlined in the species descriptions are not entirely consistent with the data presented here. thus, both b. ceti and b. pinnipedialis are described as a antigen dominant but isolates included in this study, corresponding to both of these species, react with monospecific sera to both a and m antigens. furthermore isolates of b. ceti are described as being lysed by wb phage but not lysed by tb phage. however, in this study we found exceptions to this description for both wb phage  and tb phage  with reproducible results. similarly isolates of b. pinnipedialis are described as being lysed by wb phage with 'a small number' of isolates being lysed by tb phage. while results reported here agree with the latter observation there are many examples in this study of isolates corresponding to b. pinnipedialis not being lysed by wb phage .

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the most extensive characterisation of marine mammal strains, based on traditional brucella bioyping approaches and molecular approaches, carried out to date. the marine mammal brucella strains described in this paper could readily be distinguished from terrestrial brucella species using omp pcr-rflp, is <dig> fingerprinting, and irs-derivative pcr. however, characteristic profiles based on conventional biotyping were not apparent. using molecular methods, strains fell into rational groups, with good congruence between methods and with the preferred host. strains originating from cetaceans clearly fall into two groups with either dolphins or porpoises as their preferred host. these findings are consistent with previous suggestions, based on other molecular evidence  <cit> , that the recently described species b. ceti could be further subdivided. strains from seals fell into one major group corresponding to the recently described species b. pinnipedialis. however, a small number of strains examined from hooded seals, while clustering most closely to b. pinnipedialis, were quite distinct from the other seal strains using omp pcr-rflp and is <dig> fingerprinting. again this is consistent with observations elsewhere  <cit>  and suggests that there are also further ecological subdivisions within pinniped brucella isolates. while a large number of isolates were characterised in this study, their geographical distribution is limited, and it is clear that much more extensive and global surveillance is required in order to fully understand the distribution, ecology and genetic relatedness of brucella isolates from marine mammals.
