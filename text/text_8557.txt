BACKGROUND
the rosaceae is an important plant family that includes more than  <dig> genera and  <dig> species. the family belongs to the rosid clade and is closely related to the salicaceae , leguminoseae , cucurbitaceae  and more distantly related to the brassicaceae . the rosaceae is divided into three subfamilies, two of which include some of the most economically important temperate fruit crops  <cit> . the largest subfamily is the spiraoideae to which malus , pyrus  and prunus  belong. the second largest subfamily is the rosoideae to which fragaria , rubus  and rosa  belong. within the family, apple, peach and strawberry have been utilized as model species for rosaceae biology, genetics and genomics  <cit> .

comparative analyses of plant genomes offer insights into genome evolution and speciation of closely as well as more distantly related species. in particular, knowledge of the extent and locations of syntenic blocks and chromosomal rearrangements enables the transfer of genomic information among species. this information would aid genome-wide as well as targeted marker development for the identification and validation of loci controlling traits that are important for crop improvement. without the availability of several sequenced plant genomes within one family, comparative analyses often rely on molecular markers that are shared among the species. one of the earliest efforts towards the construction of comparative plant maps using molecular markers was conducted in the solanaceae family. assessment of the degree of similarity between tomato and pepper  <cit>  and tomato and potato  <cit>  show that the more closely related species, tomato and potato, underwent fewer rearrangements compared to the more distantly related tomato and pepper. similarly in the poaceae family, conservation of large chromosomal regions between wheat, barley and rye genomes have been identified  <cit> . the application of comparative sequence analysis within the grasses greatly facilitated the positional cloning of important genes such as vrn <dig> from wheat, a species for which map-based cloning was deemed impossible due to its large genome size and the presence of many repetitive elements that would hamper chromosome walking efforts  <cit> .

despite the lack of extensive investigations, the potential for comparative genome analysis within the rosaceae family has been demonstrated by several studies. genome colinearity was found among prunus species  <cit> . these comparative studies were based on the prunus reference map , the most detailed genetic map in the rosaceae, that is derived from an interspecific almond  cv. texas Ã— peach  cv. earlygold  f <dig> mapping population  <cit> . good colinearity and marker transferability within the family was also demonstrated by the identification of syntenic regions of the malus and prunus genomes  <cit> , and between the more distant genera prunus and fragaria  <cit> . however, a comprehensive and extensive comparative map such as those that were constructed in the solanaceae and poaceae families has not been achieved for the rosaceae. this is mostly due to the lack of conserved markers to apply across the entire family  <cit> .

genes that are highly conserved and are present as low or single copy in genomes are particularly useful as markers for genome evolution studies as well as whole genome comparative analyses  <cit> . a conserved ortholog set  is defined as a collection of genes that are conserved in sequence and copy number throughout plant evolution  <cit> . in contrast, paralogs represent duplicated regions within the genome as a result of single gene duplications and/or large scale polyploidization events  <cit> . the development of markers from single copy and conserved genes is critical in comparative mapping studies as these markers enable an unambiguous determination of the degree of synteny  <cit> . in addition, the single copy conserved genes reduce the possibility of erroneously identifying chromosomal rearrangements that could result from mapping paralogous genes  <cit> .

complete whole-genome sequence information of model plants together with improved genomic resources from other species, such as est databases, provide the opportunity for the in silico identification of candidate cos. using the arabidopsis whole genome sequence and the est databases of potato, tomato and pepper, wu et al identified  <dig> solanaceaous cos  <cit> . likewise, a universal set of cos markers was developed for the asteraceae family after comparing est from sunflower and lettuce against the whole genome of arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, comparative genome sequence analysis between the three sequenced model species, arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa and populus trichocarpa resulted in the identification of  <dig> cos candidates among the angiosperms of which  <dig> to  <dig> could be identified from pairwise comparisons among four gymnosperm est databases  <cit> . once developed, cos markers have been widely employed to link the genomes of related species within families  <cit> 

in this study, we report the first step towards a comprehensive and dense comparative genetic map for rosaceous species. we present the development of a set of conserved rosaceae gene-based sequences corresponding to single copy arabidopsis genes. these rosaceae cos  were subsequently mapped using the bin map population corresponding to the prunus txe reference map  <cit> . our analyses show that nearly all of the mapped roscos are present once in the prunus genome suggesting that this genus did not undergo a hitherto unknown recent polyploidization event. additionally, we compared the genetic location of these roscos to the physical location of the poplar and arabidopsis orthologs. these analyses identified many regions that exhibited synteny between prunus and poplar and to a lesser extent to arabidopsis.

RESULTS
construction of the roscos set
the rosaceae ests that were publicly available as of december  <dig> were used to construct the set of cos. the highest numbers of available rosaceae ests were from malus, prunus and fragaria, totaling up to  <dig> % of all rosaceae ests . after comparing these ests to arabidopsis single copy genes, we identified  <dig>  putative orthologs . the cap <dig> assembly of these ests resulted in  <dig>  unigenes corresponding to  <dig>  single copy arabidopsis genes. of these,  <dig>  were contigs comprised of at least two ests and  <dig>  were singletons. on average, the number of unigenes corresponded to  <dig>  rosaceae putative cos per arabidopsis single copy gene. when we compared the distribution among contigs versus the singletons and the mixture of contigs and singletons, the majority of arabidopsis single copy genes was represented by up to three rosaceae unigenes . also, the data showed that a significant number of the arabidopsis single copy genes were represented by singletons indicating the lack of sufficiently deep est data in the rosaceae to permit assembly into contigs. the apparent redundancy in this unigene dataset is likely due to: 1) ests corresponding to the same gene but aligning to different parts of the gene, 2) sufficient nucleotide divergence within the rosaceae est from different species such that cap <dig> would not allow them to be assembled into the same unigene, 3) errors in cloning, sequencing, as well as alternative splicing. further investigation into the unigene duplicates is provided below.

due to single pass sequencing of est clones, the chance of sequencing errors can be considerable. in an effort to avoid the design of primers in regions of poor sequence quality, we focused on the  <dig>  unigenes that were represented by at least two ests. moreover, contigs tended to have more sequence information  which was helpful in the design of primers flanking the predicted intron sites. each contig was named roscos### to indicate that this was the set of putatively conserved orthologous rosaceae sequences. we narrowed the collection down further by selecting roscos that were represented by at least two of the three key genera in the family or prunus alone . this selection was chosen to enhance the chance of successful amplification of prunus dna with the designed primers because of our goal to map these roscos on the prunus reference map. the reduction led to the final data set of  <dig>  roscos . we noticed that contigs harboring ests from more than one genus usually exhibited a higher number of mismatches in fragaria than in malus or prunus which is consistent with the greater phylogenetic distance between fragaria and the other two genera  <cit> .

amplification and mapping of roscos in prunus
of the  <dig>  roscos,  <dig> were selected for the design of intron-flanking primers because their sequences covered at least one putative intron . these primers were used to amplify the corresponding region from the txe peach parent 'earlygold', the f <dig>  and the prunus bin map set that consisted of six f <dig> individuals. amplification success and mapping ability was evaluated, which demonstrated that 91% of the primers amplified prunus dna of which only 10% were monomorphic . the percentage of roscos that exhibited only one snp was 18% whereas 43% harbored at least  <dig> snps. a total of 39% of the polymorphic roscos contained at least one indel .

3heterozygous roscos in all the genotypes of the bin set resemble bin 4: <dig> on linkage group  <dig> 

a total of  <dig> roscos were assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> prunus bins . this included six roscos for which the position could not be conclusively identified. for these six, the 'earlygold' parent and f <dig> were both heterozygous as were all the f <dig> progeny individuals . the heterozygous genotype found for all six f <dig> plants comprising the bin population is indicative of the position on the top of linkage group  <dig>  therefore, we tentatively placed these six roscos with the other roscos in bin 4: <dig> . however, it was also possible that these roscos represented recent gene duplications as was observed in a few other cases . in addition, some roscos were clearly polymorphic but could not be assigned to an existing bin. the  <dig> unbinned roscos were termed "orphan cos" of which  <dig> grouped in four distinct bins. the fact that several orphan cos clustered together suggested that these bins correctly represent the prunus genome; however, the genomic location is unknown. only 1% of the roscos exhibited ambiguous segregation due to difficulty in scoring the snps and associated double peaks in the chromatograms. six percent of the sequencing reactions failed, indicating the overall high quality of the sequence data . in all, the average marker density per centimorgan  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the eight prunus chromosomes . marker density within bins ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> per cm which might be indicative of regions of low and high recombination frequencies, respectively.

the marker density per linkage group is high and could be inflated due to the fact that one single copy arabidopsis gene is represented by, on average,  <dig>  rosaceae unigenes . among the mapped roscos, we noted that  <dig> arabidopsis single copy genes corresponded to two or more roscos . importantly, five of the  <dig> putatively duplicated arabidopsis single copy genes mapped to different positions in the prunus genome, indicating that at least some genes were duplicated in prunus while they were single copy in arabidopsis . the remaining  <dig> putatively duplicated genes mapped to the same bin which implied that these could have been derived from one rosaceae conserved gene . to further address this possibility, a closer examination of the cap <dig> assembly of the  <dig> single copy arabidopsis genes with more than one roscos representative revealed that in  <dig> cases these roscos corresponded to the same region of the arabidopsis single copy gene. the reason that these unigenes were not assembled into one roscos appeared to stem from the fact that the overlapping region was too short and/or too divergent to ensure the assembling into one roscos. it is therefore likely that these roscos correspond to a single rosaceae conserved gene and are not the result of gene duplication. for the remaining  <dig> putatively duplicated arabidopsis single copy genes, the corresponding roscos did not overlap with the same region of the arabidopsis gene. therefore, whether these roscos corresponded to the same gene or a tandemly duplicated gene pair could not be determined with the present data. however, despite the evidence of a few duplicated genes, which may have occurred after the divergence of arabidopsis-brassicaceae and rosaceae or represent gene loss in arabidopsis, these data strongly support the evidence for the lack of a recent large scale genome duplication event in prunus.

1five arabidopsis single copy genes corresponded to two roscos that map to different positions in prunus, indicating possible prunus gene duplications not found in arabidopsis.

synteny between rosaceae, arabidopsis and populus
the availability of the arabidopsis and poplar genomes allowed us to determine the level of synteny among these species and prunus. because gene annotation is more complete for arabidopsis than any other plant species, the translated arabidopsis single copy genes corresponding to roscos that mapped to the same txe bin were searched against the translated poplar genome using the tblastn function. after identifying the location in poplar of roscos that mapped together in prunus, we found several syntenic regions between these genomes . importantly, the mapping of the poplar cos confirmed nearly all the previously reported homeologous gene blocks shared by two poplar chromosomes presumed to have arisen from the most recent salicoid wide-genome duplication event  <cit> . for instance, roscos that mapped in the txe bin 1: <dig> confirmed duplicated blocks of poplar linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> . the high level of synteny between poplar and prunus as well as the conservation of gene order in paralogous regions of the poplar genome strongly supported the potential of the roscos for comparative mapping across the rosaceae family. these results also suggested that the order of the roscos in the rosaceae can be predicted based on their order in poplar, although this would have to be confirmed by genome sequence analysis or higher resolution genetic mapping. the size of the syntenic blocks was defined as large , medium  and small . as a result, we identified six large syntenic blocks represented by bins 1: <dig>  8: <dig>  8: <dig>  and the adjoining bins 5: <dig> and 5:41; 6: <dig> and 6:74; and 6: <dig> and 6: <dig>  in addition,  <dig> medium and  <dig> small syntenic blocks were also observed .

we also analyzed the number of roscos that mapped to the same prunus bin and their corresponding position in the arabidopsis genome. the data indicated that the arabidopsis -prunus synteny blocks tended to be smaller compared to the size of the populus-prunus blocks . for example, most of the blocks in arabidopsis had only three roscos within a  <dig> mb interval whereas most of the blocks in poplar had five roscos within a  <dig> mb interval. this result suggested that the order of the prunus roscos is less conserved with that of arabidopsis compared to poplar. this is an expected finding since arabidopsis is more distantly related to rosaceae than is poplar and is consistent with previous findings  <cit> .

amplification of roscos across the rosaceae
the transferability of molecular markers across different species is an important feature of conserved orthologous sequences in addition to the common ancestry these sequences represent. to explore the applicability of roscos markers in other rosaceous crops, a subset of the roscos primers was employed to amplify malus, prunus and fragaria dna. malus and prunus are phylogenetically closer than fragaria as the former two belong to the same subfamily . despite the larger distance and the multiple snp between the species, using est information from all three genera enabled the development of primers that resulted in successful amplification of more than half of the roscos in each genus . amplification failures were likely due to the difficulty in designing primers with less than two mismatches in all three genera and presence of a large intron. the amplification success rate remained approximately the same when only two genera contributed to the roscos. however, when a roscos was represented by two genera, the lowest amplification was observed in the genus for which no est contributed to the roscos. yet, even when only prunus est information is used, the amplification success rate was 77% in malus and 23% in fragaria. in general, it is evident from these data that successful amplification across all genera is enhanced when est from two genera contributed to the roscos and primer design.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative genome analysis for the rosaceae family lags behind that of other economically important families such as the solanaceae and poaceae. the roscos resource developed in this study aims to ameliorate this situation by providing a marker set that can be employed for comparative mapping and marker development as well as whole genome comparative analyses in the rosaceae family. the extensive colinearity observed between poplar and prunus demonstrates the possibility of additional marker development in targeted regions of the prunus genome based on synteny with poplar. moreover, with the advent of rosaceae species whole genome sequence information that will become available in the near future, these roscos will be instrumental to place unlinked scaffolds onto genetic maps and enable marker development to targeted regions in species whose genome is not sequenced. excellent genetic maps and whole genome sequence data are extremely important for qtl discovery and validation. therefore, the roscos resource developed herein has great potential to benefit rosaceaous crop improvement.
