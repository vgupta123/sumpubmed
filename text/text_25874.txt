BACKGROUND
the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies s, otherwise known as prion diseases, are a family of neurodegenerative diseases that include creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in man, bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle, and scrapie in sheep and goats. a notable feature of these diseases is the accumulation of   <cit> , a misfolded isoform of the host-encoded prion protein prpc  <cit> . neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neuronal death are thought to arise following deposition of fibrils of prpsc which accumulate in the brain of infected animals  <cit> . however, it remains unclear if prpsc causes neuronal damage itself, or acts via other molecular forms of prp that have been suggested as causative agents in prion disease  <cit> .

the process of neuronal loss can be investigated in vitro using highly defined synthetic peptides derived from the protease-resistant core of prpsc. the majority of neurotoxicity studies have employed a peptide consisting of amino acids 106– <dig> of the human prion protein  which possesses many of the properties of the prpsc isoform, notably a high β-pleated sheet content, fibril formation and toxicity for neurons in vitro  <cit> . a corresponding peptide has been identified from the murine prion sequence , which has also been shown to be neurotoxic  <cit> . these peptides also encompass the major part of the putative transmembrane form of prp  that is thought to be important in prion disease pathogenesis as transgenic mice overexpressing such prp molecules develop neurological disease, and the accumulation of prpres is followed closely by an increase in ctmprp  <cit> . in the current study we employed labelled moprp105- <dig> to identify organelles involved in the trafficking pathways of neurotoxic peptides. we demonstrate that in neuroblastoma cells, moprp105- <dig> co-localises with cholera toxin subunit b , which binds to the ganglioside gm <dig>  <cit>  and caveolin- <dig>  <cit> , markers of specialised microdomains called lipid rafts.

lipid rafts are highly enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids and a population of specific membrane proteins  <cit> . in some cells, lipid rafts contain cholesterol-binding proteins called caveolins that define a subset of lipid raft called caveosomes  <cit> . lipid rafts also act as platforms for cell signalling processes  <cit> , suggesting that moprp105- <dig> might interact with signalling enzymes. as a close correlation exists between the production of prostaglandins s and neuronal death in prion disease  <cit> , the association between moprp105- <dig> and the enzymes pla <dig> and cox responsible for the release of arachidonic acid  and the metabolism of aa into pgs respectively, were studied.

there is increasing evidence that cholesterol levels within the brain may affect the progression of some neurodegenerative diseases. cholesterol depletion in vitro has been shown to affect the integrity of lipid rafts  <cit>  and reducing cellular cholesterol levels reduces the sensitivity of neurons to prions  <cit> . in the following studies we have demonstrated that pre-treatment of neurons with squalestatin, a drug that inhibits cholesterol production  <cit> , alters the surface localisation and the intracellular trafficking of the moprp105- <dig> peptide. in addition, pre-treatment with squalestatin significantly reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig> or cox- <dig>  such observations raise the possibility that the neurotoxicity of prp peptides is dependent on the specific intracellular trafficking pathways of such peptides and the association with signal transduction pathways.

RESULTS
moprp105- <dig> is located within lipid rafts
initial studies demonstrated that to achieve internalisation and detection of labelled moprp105- <dig> in greater than 50% of the nb <dig> cells required at least  <dig> –  <dig> minutes incubation at 37°c . following this incubation period, 63% ±  <dig> of rhodamine-labelled moprp105- <dig> co-localised with alexa fluor  <dig> labelled ctxb, which binds to ganglioside-gm <dig> and identifies lipid rafts  <cit>  . in contrast, no co-localisation between scrambled moprp105- <dig> and ctxb was detected , indicating that the localisation of moprp105- <dig> in lipid rafts was dependent on the primary sequence of the peptide. to confirm these findings on non-transformed cells, further experiments were conducted using primary cortical neurons; comparable results were obtained . a fret signal generated between acceptor-conjugated moprp105- <dig> and donor conjugated ctxb indicated that the two molecules were in close association, approximately 10– <dig> Å . in contrast, no fret signal could be detected between scrambled moprp105- <dig> and ctxb . to determine whether caveolae played a role in the trafficking of moprp105- <dig>  neuroblastoma cells were incubated with rhodamine-labelled moprp105- <dig> for  <dig> minutes, fixed and probed with fitc labelled anti-caveolin- <dig>  we found 73% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with caveolin- <dig> . furthermore, a fret signal between moprp105- <dig> and caveolin- <dig> was also detected confirming the close association of these molecules . the fluorescence microscopy studies were complemented by lipid rafts isolation studies on moprp105- <dig> treated neuroblastoma cells. following incubation for  <dig> minutes, moprp105- <dig> was found in a tfr negative, caveolin- <dig> and ctxb positive fraction . these results confirm that moprp105- <dig> can be found in lipid rafts and that caveolin- <dig> was also present in the lipid rafts that were isolated.

moprp105- <dig> traffics via a non-classical endocytic pathway
the intracellular trafficking pathway of moprp105- <dig> was further investigated by incubating biotin-conjugated moprp105- <dig> for  <dig> hour at 37°c before fixation. fluorescence microscopy showed that only 6% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> localised in tfr positive early endosomes  and only 9% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised within lamp- <dig> positive lysosomes . in contrast, 77% ±  <dig> of scrambled moprp105- <dig> was associated with lamp- <dig> positive lysosomes , confirming the sequence dependence of moprp105- <dig> localisation. comparable results were obtained in primary cortical neurons . after  <dig> minutes at 37°c, approximately 41% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with gm <dig>  a marker for cis-golgi  and 38% ±  <dig> with grp <dig>  which identifies the er . these findings are consistent with previous reports that that molecules internalised in lipid rafts traffic to the golgi/er  <cit> . the microscopy studies were complemented by an endosomal fractionation technique, as previously described  <cit> . in neuroblastoma cells incubated with moprp105- <dig> for  <dig> hour at 37°c, moprp105- <dig> was detected in the whole microsomal extract and the cell fraction known to be enriched for golgi and er compartments  <cit> , but was not found in either tfr positive or lamp- <dig> positive fractions .

squalestatin treatment alters moprp105- <dig> trafficking
previous studies have shown that depletion of cholesterol in neurones protects against the neurotoxicity induced by prion peptides  <cit> , including moprp105- <dig> . to determine whether squalestatin was simply altering the quantity of moprp105- <dig> ingested, squalestatin treated or untreated neuroblastoma cells were incubated with  <dig> μm moprp105- <dig> conjugated to fitc. the levels of cell associated fluorescence in each condition was determined after  <dig> minutes incubation by facs analysis of cells and expressed as arbitrary units of mean fluorescence intensity. there was no significant difference between the mean fluorescence intensity for untreated and squalestatin treated cells . as a number of studies have demonstrated that lipid rafts involved in internalisation and trafficking are cholesterol sensitive, the effect of squalestatin on the intracellular trafficking of moprp105- <dig> was investigated. following pre-treatment with squalestatin, neuroblastoma cells were incubated with ctxb and moprp105- <dig> for  <dig> minutes at 37°c. fluorescence microscopy revealed that in squalestatin-treated cells only 5% ±  <dig> of the moprp105- <dig> co-localised with ctxb , whereas 75% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with ctxb in untreated neuroblastoma cells . when lipid rafts were isolated from neuroblastoma cells that had been pre-treated with squalestatin, most of the moprp105- <dig> was detected in the non-raft fraction, while ctxb and caveolin- <dig> were present in both raft and non-raft fractions . such findings suggest that the localisation of moprp105- <dig> to lipid rafts is sensitive to cholesterol depletion.

further analysis of the trafficking of moprp105- <dig> in squalestatin-treated neuroblastoma cells showed that only 7% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with the golgi  and 3% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with the er , suggesting that in these cells moprp105- <dig> does not undergo retrograde trafficking. we found that 68% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with early endosomes  and 40% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with lysosomes . these observations suggest that in squalestatin-treated cells the moprp105- <dig> peptide is diverted away from retrograde transport to the golgi/er and directed into the classical endosome/lysosomal degradative pathway. a summary of the differences in the trafficking pathways of moprp105- <dig> in untreated and squalestatin-treated neuroblastoma cells is presented as table  <dig>  the re-routing of moprp105- <dig> to the classical endocytic pathway in squalestatin-treated cells was confirmed by analysis of endosomal fractions. in endosomal fractions isolated from squalestatin-treated neuroblastoma cells pulsed with moprp105- <dig> for  <dig> hour, moprp105- <dig> was detected in the lamp- <dig> positive, tfr negative, lysosomal fraction .

moprp105- <dig> associates with cpla <dig> and cox-1
since a close association exists between pg's and prion-induced neurotoxicity  <cit> , the relationship between moprp105- <dig> and enzymes involved in the production of pgs was examined. neuroblastoma cells were incubated with moprp105- <dig> for either  <dig> minutes or  <dig> minutes at 37°c, fixed, and stained with antibodies to either cpla <dig> or cox- <dig>  after  <dig> minutes 38% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with cpla <dig>  and 70% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with cox- <dig> . after  <dig> minutes only 2% ±  <dig> of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with cpla <dig>  and no co-localisation was observed between moprp105- <dig> and cox- <dig> , indicating that the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig> or cox- <dig> was short lived.

squalestatin treatment reduces the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla2/cox-1
since treatment with squalestatin protected neurons against prions  <cit>  the effects of squalestatin on the co-localisation between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig> was examined  <dig> minutes after the addition of peptide. pre-treatment with  <dig> μm squalestatin significantly reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig>  . similarly, pre-treatment with squalestatin reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cox- <dig>  . neurons treated with paf antagonists are also resistant to the otherwise toxic effects of prions  <cit>  and pre-treatment with  <dig> μm of a paf antagonist  reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig>  . treatment with hexa-paf also reduced the association between moprp105- <dig> and cox- <dig>  . a summary of the differences in co-localisation between moprp105- <dig> and the signalling enzymes in untreated and squalestatin-treated neuroblastoma cells is presented as table  <dig> 

discussion
although neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neuronal loss are key features of prion diseases, the molecular mechanisms that that result in neuronal damage remain poorly understood. synthetic peptides have been extensively used to model the process of neuronal degeneration in vitro and in the present study we analysed the trafficking of moprp105- <dig> in neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurones. most of the moprp105- <dig> molecules co-localised with ganglioside gm <dig>  a marker of lipid rafts identified by ctxb, and with caveolin- <dig>  a marker of a lipid raft subset called caveolae. fret analysis, a technique with spatial resolution beyond the limits of conventional fluorescence imaging, demonstrated that moprp105- <dig> was intimately associated with both gm <dig> and caveolin- <dig> . separation of lipid rafts from cell membranes by detergent extraction confirmed the microscopy data . it not clear why moprp105- <dig> localises to lipid rafts, one possibility is that lipid rafts contain a high percentage of saturated fatty acids, which provides a hydrophobic environment that stabilises the peptide within the membrane. another possibility is that many of the putative receptors for prions  <cit>  are found within lipid rafts, thus, peptide-receptor interactions may be responsible for targeting moprp105- <dig> to these domains.

the trafficking of molecules within cells is partly dependent on the mechanism of internalisation, thus, molecules that are ingested via clathrin-dependent endocytosis traffic via endosomes into degradative lysosomes  <cit> . in contrast, agents targeted to lipid rafts or caveolae are internalised by clathrin-independent endocytosis and traffic into different cellular compartments. moprp105- <dig> trafficked into both the golgi and er ; consistent with reports that the cargo of caveolae is directed into the golgi  <cit> . these results are consistent with moprp105- <dig> trafficking via the non-classical endocytic pathway, recently defined through the trafficking of gm <dig> positive lipid rafts  <cit> . only a small percentage of moprp105- <dig> was associated with either tfr or lamp- <dig>  indicating that it was rarely found in early endosomes or lysosomes. microscopy data was supported by organelle fractionation studies in which endosomes involved in the classical endocytic pathways were fractionated. moprp105- <dig> was not found in fractions containing either tfr or lamp- <dig>  but was found in an intermediate density fraction known to contain golgi/er  <cit> . taken together these results indicate that moprp105- <dig> does not traffic down the classical endocytic route and avoids the lysosomes. we speculate that the avoidance of proteolytic lysosomes may facilitate the build up of neurotoxic peptides during disease progression. the localisation of moprp105- <dig> to lipid rafts depends on the sequence of amino acids as a control peptide made up of the same amino acids synthesized in a scrambled sequence did not localise within lipid rafts. subsequently, the scrambled moprp105- <dig> control peptide trafficked to endosomes and lysosomes, emphasising the sequence dependent nature of the intracellular trafficking of the peptide. although most of the studies presented are on neuroblastoma cells we found that moprp105- <dig> trafficked in a similar manner in non-transformed primary cortical neurones. the sequence specificity of this effect would argue against moprp non-specifically associating with lipid rafts through for example, hydrophobicity, as the composition of the scrambled peptide was the same as moprp105- <dig> 

previous studies demonstrated that neurons treated with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor squalestatin, a drug that inhibits squalene synthase and reduces cholesterol production without affecting the production of isoprenoid precursors  <cit> , were protected against the otherwise toxic effects of prions  <cit> . since the formation of lipid rafts and lipid raft-dependent uptake is sensitive to cholesterol depletion  <cit> , we examined the effects of squalestatin-treatment on the trafficking of moprp105- <dig>  one possible explanation for the neuroprotective effects of squalestatin, that it prevents ingestion of moprp105- <dig>  was excluded by studies that showed that there was no significant difference in the amounts of peptide taken up by untreated and treated cells. however, we did detect a difference in the trafficking of moprp105- <dig> between treated and untreated cells. squalestatin-treatment of neuroblastoma cells greatly reduced the amounts of moprp105- <dig> that co-localised with either ctxb or with caveolin- <dig> indicating the most of the peptide was no longer present in lipid rafts. this observation was confirmed by triton x- <dig> extractions which showed that most of the moprp105- <dig> peptide was now in the non-raft fraction. fluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation studies both suggested that in squalestatin-treated cells moprp105- <dig> trafficked down a classical endocytic pathway into lysosomes, avoiding the golgi/er. these results are consistent with reports that cholesterol depletion results in the loss of lipid raft functions, including raft-dependent endocytosis and subsequent intracellular trafficking  <cit> .

the neurotoxicity of prion-derived peptides depends on the activation of specific signalling pathways including pla <dig> and the cox enzymes that convert aa into pgs  <cit> . furthermore, prion-induced injury is associated with increased levels of pge <dig>  <cit> . selective inhibitors indicated the importance of the cox- <dig> isoform in prion-mediated neurotoxicity  <cit> . in untreated neuroblastoma cells a significant proportion of moprp105- <dig> co-localised with cpla <dig> and cox- <dig>  this association was short lived . the brief association observed could be a result of peptide rapidly transiting the cox-1/cpla <dig> containing compartment, or alternatively localisation of these enzymes is known to be transient and dependent on the activation state of the cell  <cit> . these observations suggest that the association of moprp105- <dig> with cpla <dig> and cox- <dig> activates these enzymes leading to the production of toxic second messengers. pre-treatment of neuroblastoma cells with squalestatin reduced the co-localisation between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig> or cox- <dig>  and reduced prion-induced pge <dig> production  <cit> . taken together these observations suggest that in normal neuroblastoma cells moprp105- <dig> accumulates in lipid rafts where they activate the pla2/cox pathway resulting in the production of neurotoxins including pge <dig>  <cit> . thus, the neuroprotective effect of squalestatin treatment may simply be by the dispersal of lipid rafts, which prevent the formation of moprp105-132/pla2/cox- <dig> complexes and reduce the production of neurotoxins. similar effects where found in neuroblastoma cells treated with the paf antagonist , which protects neurones against prion-mediated neuronal damage  <cit> . pre-treatment of neuroblastoma cells with the paf antagonist reduced the co-localisation between moprp105- <dig> and cpla <dig>  and significantly between moprp105- <dig> and cox- <dig>  this observation is consistent with reports that paf antagonists reduce pge <dig> production in prion peptide treated neuroblastoma cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data demonstrate that in normal neuroblastoma cells the majority of moprp105- <dig> is found in lipid rafts and traffics via a non-classical endocytic, recycling pathway. this pathway involves internalisation via lipid rafts and trafficking into the golgi and er. during this process moprp105- <dig> co-localises with the signalling enzymes, cpla <dig> and cox- <dig>  enzymes that are involved in the production of prostaglandins, bioactive lipids closely associated with neuronal death in prion diseases. treatment of neuroblastoma cells with squalestatin was shown to prevent peptide-induced neurotoxicity but did not prevent internalisation. however squalestatin treatment was associated with altered localisation and trafficking of moprp105- <dig> in neuroblastoma cells. in these cells moprp105- <dig> is not found in lipid rafts, did not associate with cpla <dig> and cox- <dig>  and trafficked into lysosomes. we speculate that the effect of squalestatin in negating prion peptide induced neurotoxicity may result from altered trafficking of moprp105- <dig> thus preventing interactions with specific signalling pathways. this hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that a second neuroprotective drug, hexa-paf, also prevented peptide association with cpla <dig> and cox- <dig>  as altering the trafficking of prion-derived peptides appears to be associated with protection against neurotoxicity, strategies to manipulate intracellular trafficking pathways could lead to novel therapeutic approaches in prion disease.
