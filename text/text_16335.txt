BACKGROUND
the retinal pigment epithelium  is a multifunctional neural-crest derived cell layer, flanked by the photoreceptor cells on the apical side and the bruch's membrane /choroid complex on the basolateral side. among others, the rpe supplies the photoreceptors with nutrients, regulates the ion balance in the subretinal space and recycles retinal from the photoreceptor cells, which is necessary for the continuation of the visual cycle. <cit>  it also phagocytoses and degrades photoreceptor outer segments and absorbs light that is projected onto the retina. <cit>  finally, the rpe secretes a number of growth factors that maintain the structure and cellular differentiation of the adjacent tissues. <cit> 

the importance of the rpe in vision is illustrated by the major involvement of this monolayer of cells in genetically determined retinal diseases like age related macular degeneration  and retinitis pigmentosa . <cit>  since the great majority of genes implicated in amd or rp are expressed in either the rpe or the photoreceptors, the identification of additional genes highly expressed in the rpe may provide valuable clues in the search for new genes involved in retinal disease.  <cit> 

obviously, the functional properties of rpe cells are determined by the genes they express and the proteins they encode. although the rpe cell is one of the best studied neural cell types,  <cit>  large scale assignment of expressed genes to the rpe has been largely dependent on rna based studies. assignment of proteins to the rpe has been hampered by its autofluorescence and melanin content. large-scale rpe related expression studies were performed using cdna arrays, serial analysis of gene expression , expressed sequence tag  analysis, and multiple rt-pcrs. the number of eyes used in these studies ranged from one to fifteen, and the number of genes under investigation from  <dig> to  <dig> .  <cit>  while these studies provided valuable information, they were limited in either the number of genes or the number of eyes under investigation, or they lacked specificity due to the tissue sampling method used. moreover, most or all of these studies focused on the mean gene expression profile of all samples together, rather than documenting potential interindividual differences.  <cit>  a robust and specific dataset on rpe expression levels from a substantial number of individuals is lacking and a great deal remains unknown with regard to the interindividual expression differences.

a number of biological processes and cellular functions of genes expressed in the rpe were described in three of the above mentioned studies. <cit>  all three identified protein metabolism and signal transduction as an important functional class of genes expressed by the rpe. <cit>  similarly, cell structure, <cit>  cell proliferation, <cit>  gene transcription <cit>  and energy metabolism were described in two out of three studies. finally, individual studies also identified overrepresentation of membrane proteins, <cit>  transport or channel proteins, <cit>  heat shock proteins <cit>  and vitamin a metabolism. <cit>  in a recent microarray study we compared rpe gene expression in the macula with the retinal periphery and demonstrated, among other things, consistent differential expression of extracellular matrix genes corresponding with proteins in bm. <cit> 

the aim of the current study is to describe the gene expression levels and the interindividual variation in gene expression of native human macular rpe cells in a systematic fashion. in addition, we annotate the functions and biological pathways associated with rpe expressed  genes.

to our knowledge this is the first study to present data on  human macular rpe gene expression and interindividual differences on a large scale of  <dig>  genes, resulting in a further detailed description of the rpe transcriptome.

RESULTS
rna from six selected human macular rpe samples was hybridized to six custom made  <dig> k microarrays enriched for neural transcripts. we functionally annotated and analyzed the data using rosetta resolver, the web tool david and ingenuity software, with regard to gene expression level and variability as well as functional annotation. furthermore, we specifically looked at the expression levels and variability of retinal disease genes.

analysis of gene expression levels 
the mean expression intensities  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  , . the distribution of μint across percentile bins of  <dig> percent of all genes is shown in figure  <dig>  we used the 90th, 50th and 10th percentile of the μint to categorize our data into groups with high , moderate , low  and very low  expression. we focused our analysis on the biologically most relevant gene groups with high, moderate and low gene expression levels. these categories yielded  <dig>  genes with high rpe expression,  <dig>  genes with moderate expression and  <dig>  genes with low expression. the results of the overrepresentation analysis are presented below, and in table  <dig>  the overrepresentation analysis of all expressed genes,irrespective of their gene expression level , did not yield additional functional categories apart from ecm-receptor interaction, and is not presented separately.

ribosome 
long-term depression 
o-glycan biosynthesis 
focal adhesion 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 
complement and coagulation cascades 
antigen processing and presentation 
overrepresented pathways were identified with b: a benjamini-hochberg corrected p value <  <dig> , or e: an ease score p value <  <dig> . perc: percentile, high cv: > 90th percentile, low cv: < 10th percentile.

genes with high expression levels 
we considered the group of highly expressed genes the most biologically relevant, and, consequently, for this group bioinformatic analysis was more extensive than for other categories. in addition to a kegg pathway analysis, we also performed an ingenuity analysis of the overlap between our highly expressed genes and those identified in the literature. kegg pathway analysis revealed oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome and atp synthesis as significantly overrepresented pathways  . there was an overlap of  <dig>  genes between the highly expressed genes of the rpe transcriptome and the genes identified in retina/rpe genes identified in at least two studies in the literature. <cit>  ingenuity analysis of the overlapping genes revealed oxidative phosphorylation as the most significant pathway involved. comparison of our highly expressed genes to those expressed only in rpe studies , <cit>  showed a clustering of genes in the cell-cell signaling and interaction network .

the thirty most highly expressed rpe genes from our data set are presented in table  <dig>  most notably, this list contains two glutamate transporters  <cit> , one of which is known to be expressed in the rpe  <cit>  and a gene , that was previously suggested to have an association with amd, <cit>  with known expression in the rpe. <cit>  the top thirty list contained three additional genes with known expression in the rpe  <cit>  and two genes that play a role in the protection against oxidative stress . finally, we identified a number of genes with a relevant cellular function described in other tissues than the retina, like clu   and acn <dig>  . <cit> 

among these genes we identified five genes with known expression in the rpe . the slc17a <dig> gene is a glutamate transporter, like the slc1a <dig> gene which is also in the top  <dig> highly expressed genes. the cst <dig> gene was previously suggested to have an association with amd <cit> . the list also contains two genes with a role in the protection against oxidative stress . the gngt <dig> gene, expressed in photoreceptors <cit> , suggests the inevitable presence of photoreceptor contamination. perc: percentile.

genes with moderate expression levels 
upon analyzing this group of  <dig>  genes, we found a statistically significant overrepresentation of the kegg pathways phosphatidylinositol signaling and aminosugars metabolism  .

genes with low expression levels 
among the  <dig>  genes with low expression levels there was a statistically significant overrepresentation of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction , long-term depression, o-glycan biosynthesis and calcium signaling pathways  .

analysis of gene expression variability 
we analyzed the interindividual variability in gene expression  among the  <dig>  genes with expression levels in the rpe higher than the 10th percentile, . aside from the overrepresented cluster ecm-receptor interaction , this yielded little extra information compared to the cv assignment in subcategories of high, moderate and low expression levels , and is not presented in detail here. the thirty genes with the highest interindividual variation in expression levels in our dataset are presented in table  <dig> 

note that although xist, egfl <dig> and rbm <dig> are x-chromosomal transcripts, their high interindividual variation could not be explained by the gender of the donors . perc: percentile.

genes with high interindividual variability 
among the  <dig> genes with both a high cv and high μint there was an overrepresentation of genes involved in antigen processing as well as the complement and coagulation cascades. the  <dig> genes with a high cv and moderate μint showed an overrepresentation of genes involved in focal adhesion and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and the  <dig> genes with high cv and low μint showed an overrepresentation of genes involved in type i diabetes mellitus. the latter group contains mainly major histocompatibility complex genes and interleukin 1α .

genes with low interindividual variability 
perc: percentile.

gene expression analysis of known retinal disease genes
known macular disease genes
we then investigated both the expression levels and interindividual expression differences of  <dig> macular disease genes in our rpe gene expression dataset . <cit>  in terms of expression levels,  <dig> percent of the macular disease genes were found in the top  <dig> percent of genes with high macular rpe expression levels. in terms of variability,  <dig> percent of the macular disease genes were found in the top  <dig> percent of genes with highly variable macular rpe expression levels. in addition, none of the macular degeneration genes were found in the  <dig> percent of genes with stable macular rpe expression.

data are grouped by coefficient of variation  in descending order into three groups, high cv , intermediate  and low cv . perc: percentile.

a number of genes currently known or suggested to be associated with amd, showed high  or moderate  expression levels in the rpe. with the exception of htra <dig> , all these genes also showed high interindividual variation.

known peripheral retinal disease genes
finally, we analyzed the gene expression levels and interindividual differences in expression of  <dig> genes known to be involved in diseases of the peripheral retina <cit>  in our macular rpe expression dataset .

data are grouped by coefficient of variation  in descending order into three groups, high cv , an intermediate group  and cv low .

of this group,  <dig> percent were found in the  <dig> percent of genes with high expression levels in the macular rpe. eleven percent of the known peripheral disease genes were found in the  <dig> percent of genes with high interindividual variation in expression in the macular rpe.

discussion
this study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the macular rpe transcriptome, with a focus on interindividual differences in rpe gene expression levels. we based our analyses on microarray data from six healthy human donor eyes. in addition, we performed a kegg pathway analysis on genes with high, moderate and low expression levels and on genes with high and low interindividual variation in expression.

only five genes from our top  <dig> most highly expressed rpe genes were previously known to be expressed in the human rpe in vivo: slc17a <dig>  <cit> , cst <dig> ) <cit> , ptgds  <cit> , ttr  <cit> and hsp90b <dig> ) <cit>  illustrating the lack of knowledge on the rpe transcriptome.

strengths and limitations of the study design
a recent statistical review suggested that a microarray study investigating a single tissue type, requires  <dig> biological replicate samples to draw statistically significant conclusions. <cit>  consequently, we used the rpe gene expression from  <dig> different individuals. previous rpe gene expression studies were based on less than six eyes, with the exception of a single cdna microarray study limited to  <dig>  genes that was based on  <dig> individuals.  <cit> 

our study design has a number of strong points and limitations, previously described in detail. <cit>  in summary, the strength of our study design comes from our strict selection criteria for the donor eyes , the use of a laser dissection microscope for high cellular specificity and minimal tissue manipulation, large scale analysis using a  <dig> k microarray and a common reference design for comparison of all samples. overall, our study was designed to minimize gene expression differences due to sampling methodology  and technical causes, avoiding unnecessary mechanical handling of the freshly frozen tissue, the use of laser dissection microscopy to isolate homogeneous cell samples, stringent control of rna quality and amplification procedures. <cit>  initially, we performed dye swap experiments as technical replicates for three of our samples in order to ascertain the potential variability induced by dye bias. we observed a high correlation between the data from our analysis including and excluding the dye swap experiment . at the same time, dobbin , simon  and others, used a similar study design as we did, and concluded that in a common reference design it is not necessary to perform dye swaps if the common reference is consistently labeled with the same dye.  <cit>  potential gene-specific dye bias will affect all experimental samples equally, and therefore does not confound the comparisons. <cit>  consequently, we decided to perform the remaining three experiments without a dye swap.

one of the methodological limitations of our study was the limited number of eyes that met our selection criteria. the availability of a larger number of eyes would render more robust results with regard to interindividual variation. nonetheless, our data give a good first impression of variability in gene expression levels in the rpe. an additional limitation is that a small amount of photoreceptor contamination was inevitably present in our rpe sample, see also table  <dig>  <cit>  furthermore, we cannot distinguish possible transient from permanent gene expression level differences. our study is also limited by the fact that the measurement of gene expression of individual genes by microarray is inevitably influenced by a number of factors, like oligo design and the continuous updates of the human genome sequence. to correct for this last limitation, we focused our analysis on groups of genes with a wide range of expression levels, rather than on individual gene expression levels. finally, our cut off criteria for high and low expression levels and interindividual differences are arbitrary. while this may indeed have consequences for individual genes, the impact on our functional analysis, which is based on large numbers of genes, will be minimal.

despite these limitations, our data, combined with data from other retinal gene expression studies , <cit>  contributes significantly to the currently expanding knowledge of the rpe transcriptome.

functional assessment of native gene expression in the macular rpe
the notion that the identity of a cell type is determined by the genes it expresses, prompted us to analyze the native macular rpe transcriptome. in the following section we describe the overrepresented functional groups that we identified in the rpe.

highly expressed rpe genes and oxidative stress
both functional annotation with david and ingenuity analysis independently indicate a statistically significant overrepresentation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and atp synthesis in our dataset. this is in line with the fact that the rpe has a high metabolic activity and energy demand. the down side of this high activity is that the rpe has to deal with large amounts of oxidative stress. the oxidative stress in the rpe is further augmented by the light projected onto the retina combined with the rich oxygen supply and lipid peroxidation in phagocytosed rod outer segments. <cit>  given the high level of oxidative stress, the expression of genes contributing to the defense of the rpe cell against oxidative stress is essential for cell survival. our data confirm this notion, which is highlighted by the expression of the mt1a  gene, a metallothionein, and the tp <dig>  gene in the top  <dig> most highly expressed rpe genes. metallothioneins are thought to play a role in protection against oxidative stress; addition of tp <dig>  to human cell lines leads to a  <dig> percent decrease in reactive oxygen species. <cit> 

rpe and the immune system
our data show an overrepresentation of genes with highly variable expression in a number of pathways related to the immune system. we identified the following four pathways, the complement and coagulation cascades , the antigen processing and presentation pathway  and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway . both the antigen processing and presentation pathway and the type  <dig> diabetes mellitus pathway contain mhc genes responsible for antigen presentation. cytokine production is highly sensitive to inflammation in the rpe. <cit>  the cytokine-cytokine receptor pathway contains a number of chemokines, small secreted proteins involved in the chemotaxic attraction of monocytes and neutrophils. the highly variable expression of genes involved in the immune system is most likely explained by both genetic differences and a variable degree of subclinical inflammation  among our donors.

rpe genes and the extracellular matrix 
the close interaction of the rpe with bruch's membrane  is exemplified by the overrepresentation of genes in two pathways. the first pathway contains genes involved in extracellular matrix  receptor interaction. <cit>  the ecm receptor interaction pathway, part of the focal adhesion pathway, contains collagens type i, iii and iv, thrombospondin, laminin beta  <dig> , fibronectin  <dig> , reelin , and cd <dig> antigen . collagen type iv, laminin and fibronectin are all main components of basement membranes, such as bm. surprisingly, the genes in this group showed highly variable expression, which may indicate that the molecular composition of bm is different among individuals. alternatively, it has been described that with age, the solubility of collagens in bm decreases significantly. <cit>  thus, the high variability in expression levels of collagen genes between our samples can perhaps be explained by differences in the physiological donor age.

a second pathway that connects rpe expressed genes to bm is the glycosaminoglycan  degradation pathway. there was an overrepresentation of genes with stable and high expression in this pathway. gag synthesis has been shown in cultured rpe and gag's are secreted into the extracellular matrix and bm. <cit>  interestingly, gag's are rapidly turned over in the rpe, and the composition of gag in bm changes with age.  <cit>  our data suggest there is a strict regulation of gag turnover in the rpe, even in donors of different ages.

additional rpe gene functions
in addition to the involvement of the rpe genes in oxidative stress, bm and the immune system, analysis of our data revealed the following two functional categories: protein synthesis and glutamate transport.

a high level of protein synthesis is essential for the rpe to maintain its multiple functions. <cit>  this is exemplified by the overrepresentation of genes with high expression in the ribosomal protein activity pathway.

glutamate transport is an important process in the rpe. the top  <dig> most highly expressed rpe genes contained two glutamate transporters slc1a <dig>  and slc17a <dig> . the latter transporter was already known to be expressed in the human rpe in vivo. <cit>  glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that is released from the photoreceptors both in a light influenced fashion, and upon apoptosis. since high concentrations of glutamate are neurotoxic, re-uptake and transport of glutamate are essential for the normal retinal homeostasis. <cit> 

finally, in the overlap between previous rpe studies <cit>  and genes with high expression in our rpe transcriptome, we identified the cell-cell signaling and interaction network. this network contains several genes involved in signal transduction, like slc7a <dig>  and nck <dig>  further emphasizing the important role of the rpe in interaction with other cell types. <cit> 

comparison with literature
comparison of our most highly expressed rpe genes to the literature revealed a distinct overlap. schulz and coworkers recently combined different analyses of the retina/rpe/choroid transcriptome, and described  <dig>  retina/rpe genes found in at least two studies. <cit>  out of these  <dig> , we currently assign  <dig>  genes to be expressed by the rpe,  <dig>  of which are highly expressed.  in addition, the same review <cit>  suggested that  <dig> genes were expressed only in rpe studies. we assign  <dig> of these  <dig> genes to the rpe as well;  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes have high expression levels in our rpe transcriptome analysis. 

finally, of the genes previously described to be specifically expressed either in the retina or the rpe in individual studies, <cit>   <dig> genes are also present in our rpe transcriptome analysis. twenty two of these  <dig> genes had high expression levels. 

while data on interindividual variation in rpe gene expression are lacking, functional properties of rpe genes have been investigated previously.

the combined functional annotation from three studies resemble our functional annotation in the following areas: gene regulation, transcription, protein metabolism, cell proliferation, survival and signaling, energy metabolism, cytoskeleton and inflammation. <cit>  the current study adds the following more specific functional categories, oxidative phosphorylation, atp synthesis, ribosome, phosphatidylinositol signaling and aminosugars metabolism. among the highly expressed rpe genes we identified an overrepresentation of the complement cascade and genes involved in the composition of bm.

gene expression analysis of known retinal disease genes
in our macular rpe sample we observed that  <dig> percent of genes involved in macular disorders according to the literature, <cit>  had high expression levels. in contrast, only  <dig> percent of the peripheral retinal disease genes <cit>  were highly expressed in our sample. these figures may be biased, since the search for candidate genes has been focused on cell-specific highly expressed genes in the first place. the figures probably reflect the fact that rpe gene expression differences exist between the retinal macula and the periphery. <cit>  however, our data probably also imply that the mean expression level of a gene in the rpe is informative in the search for new candidate disease genes.

with respect to the variability in gene expression, we found that the interindividual differences of currently known macular retinal disease genes were somewhat higher than the overall pattern of variation seen in the entire array. whether or not this finding is coincidental remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we present comprehensive data on  gene expression profile of the rpe based on  <dig>  genes from six different healthy human donors. this is the first study to describe the interindividual variability in gene expression levels from a microarray analysis of the rpe transcriptome.

there was no correlation between the height of gene expression  and the interindividual variability  . we noted a more than hundred fold difference in cv between genes with stable expression and genes with variable expression levels.

our data show that the rpe most likely has high levels of protein synthesis, a high energy demand and is subject to high levels of oxidative stress as well as a variable degree of inflammation. finally, our data show high interindividual variability in expression of ecm genes and indicate a high and constant level of glycosaminoglycan  turnover, two functions related to bm.

the fact that large interindividual differences exist in the expression of a number of known retinal disease genes has not only functional implications, but is also relevant for new candidate disease gene identification and the development of dose-dependent  therapeutic strategies.
