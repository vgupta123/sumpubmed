BACKGROUND
dna replication in eukaryotes is catalysed by a complex of proteins termed the replisome. formation of the replisome occurs at multiple origins of replication and is a stepwise process co-ordinated by the cell cycle control machinery . central to the replisome in all phases of its genesis and function are mcm  proteins.

the genes encoding mcm proteins were first identified in budding and fission yeasts through various cell cycle mutant screens, most notably bik tye's mcm screen for mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in the ability to propagate centromeric plasmids containing a single origin of replication  <cit> . the phenotype of many mcm mutants is dependent on the exact identity of the origin of replication, suggesting a defect affecting the initiation of dna replication  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae six mcm genes, mcm2–mcm <dig>  <cit> , were originally identified and have shared sequence characteristics suggesting homology and a history of paralogous duplication  <cit> .

the mcm proteins form numerous and complex interactions, central to which is the formation of a hexamer, the mcm2- <dig> complex  <cit> . mcm2- <dig> is loaded on to the origin recognition complex  at the origin of replication prior to dna replication, during late m and g <dig> phases of the cell cycle, to form the pre-replication complex . this is activated at the g1-s transition of the cell cycle by the assembly of further protein components, including the non-homologous mcm <dig> protein, in response to cell cycle kinase activities . mcm <dig> associates with the mcm2- <dig> hexamer in the active replisome and helps to stabilise dna polymerase α-primase . mcm2- <dig>  together with other accessory factors, is believed to act as the replicative helicase, unwinding dna at the two replication forks to provide single-stranded template on which replicative synthesis can take place  <cit> .

genes encoding mcm helicases are also found in archaea  but, in contrast to eukaryotes, the archaeal helicase generally comprises a homohexamer formed from multiple protein copies encoded by a single mcm gene  <cit> . mcm <dig> has no recognised homologue in archaea. two more members of the mcm2- <dig> family have recently been described in eukaryotes: mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  mcm <dig> functions in aspects of dna replication in vertebrates  <cit>  but not in drosophila, where it has a meiotic role  <cit> ; it is absent from nematodes and yeast. less is known about mcm <dig>  <cit>  which is the largest of the mcm2- <dig> paralogues, having a unique long c-terminal region  <cit> . it was originally thought that mcm <dig> is vertebrate-specific as it is absent from drosophila, nematodes and yeasts  <cit> , but it is now recognised that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> have a more widespread eukaryotic distribution  <cit> . mcm <dig> is a transcription factor which is not directly involved in dna replication and will not be considered here  <cit> .

our knowledge of mcm proteins and dna replication is derived from research principally based on yeast and vertebrate animals. these taxa are members of the opisthokonts, which according to current taxonomic consensus is one of six eukaryotic 'supergroups'  <cit>  and therefore only represents a relative small proportion of the evolutionary history and genomic diversity of known eukaryotic life. for the other five eukaryotic supergroups, studies of the dna replisome or mcm protein function and diversity are limited  <cit> . here we use comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis to investigate the distribution of mcm dna replication proteins across the eukaryotes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the mcm2- <dig> proteins, and to gain insights into mcm functional diversification, in distantly related eukaryotic taxa and at the base of the eukaryotic tree of life.

RESULTS
identification of mcms
blast algorithms were used to identify mcm homologues encoded by the eukaryotic genomes of the  <dig> species listed in table  <dig>  covering five of the six eukaryotic supergroups  <cit>  . in naegleria and xenopus there were two proteins that grouped with mcm <dig>  and in xenopus two mcm <dig> proteins were found  <cit> , providing the only examples of recent mcm duplication events among the taxa investigated. comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis  showed that genes encoding six mcm proteins, mcm2- <dig> homologues, were present in every eukaryotic genome sampled. these data suggest that the last common eukaryotic ancestor  possessed all six mcm2- <dig> paralogues and this ancient cell was therefore likely to contain a multi-subunit mcm protein complex composed of six paralogous proteins. these data suggest that an intricate and heterogeneous mcm protein complex evolved in an early phase of eukaryotic evolution.

"+" indicates presence of an orthologue. "-" indicates that no orthologue was detected in the genome. "*" indicates that the genome encodes two isoforms of mcm <dig> 

genes encoding the two most recently identified mcm family proteins, mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  were found to be present in the majority of eukaryotic genomes analysed and only absent in some opisthokonts, excavates and chromalveolates. generally the mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> paralogues were either both present or both absent, suggesting that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> may have associated functions. of the taxa surveyed we found only one exception to this rule: drosophila spp. possess mcm <dig> but lack mcm <dig> 

blast searches and local pfam searches of mcm <dig> homologues showed that mcm <dig> was also widely distributed among the eukaryotes sampled . mcm <dig> is conserved in opisthokonts and plantae, except in encephalitozoon and cyanidioschyzon which represent eukaryotes with relatively small genomes and often encode divergent protein sequences  <cit> . mcm <dig> proteins exhibit greater sequence divergence than mcm2- <dig> orthologues and we cannot rule out that some mcm <dig> orthologues may have fallen below detection limits employed here, however the distribution pattern of mcm <dig> in representatives of different eukaryotic supergroups does not correlate with that of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> .

the phylogeny and evolution of eukaryotic mcm2-9
a phylogeny of the full mcm2- <dig> protein family was reconstructed from the amino acid alignments of each conserved mcm domain  <cit>  by performing a fast maximum-likelihood  analysis using phyml  <cit>  and a bayesian analysis using mrbayes  <cit> . both phylogenetic analyses classified the mcm homologues as belonging to specific paralogue families and resolved the eukaryotic mcm2- <dig> paralogues into six distinct monophyletic groups . each mcm paralogous set was supported by moderate to high ml bootstrap values and bayesian posterior probabilities  . these results support the conclusion that all six mcm2- <dig> proteins were present in the lcea and that consecutive duplication, which formed these six defined mcm paralogues, occurred prior to the diversification of the sampled eukaryotic taxa.

our phylogenetic analyses also grouped mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> into two distinct monophyletic groups supported by ml bootstrap values and bayesian posterior probabilities  and placed mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> as sister paralogues to the exclusion of all other mcm paralogues  . this shared derived ancestry and linked pattern of presence and absence suggest that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> have both co-function and distinct co-ancestry.

both phylogenetic analyses failed to resolve the branching relationship between the mcm paralogues. to attempt to resolve these relationships a "noah's ark" dataset was analysed comprising a more limited sampling of eukaryotes from each major taxon ; this also failed to yield resolution in the backbone of the tree . the lack of resolution among these ancient paralogue groups may be the consequence of lack of signal within the relatively short alignment used for phylogenetic analyses . this feature could also be a product of a hard polytomy or the rapid consecutive duplication of mcm parental forms into eight paralogues at the base of the eukaryotic tree resulting in limited availability of evolutionary signal to support the relative branching order of the mcm paralogues.

previous studies on dna replication of archaea have already shown that the core replication machineries of the eukaryotes and archaea possess fundamental similarities and have many homologous protein components  <cit> , indicative of common ancestry. there is currently no known eubacterial homologue to the eukaryotic mcms but we identified a single highly conserved mcm homologue in all the archaea studied . our phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the four paralogues in the complete genome sequence of the euryarchaeote m. jannaschii can be best explained by a series of archaea-specific gene duplications   which occurred separately from the eukaryotic mcm gene duplications. our analyses therefore suggest that the eukaryotic mcm2- <dig> may be derived by gene duplication events from a single, archaeal-like, ancestral mcm and the diversification of this archaeal-like mcm would have given rise to mcm2- <dig> encoded in the genome of the lcea.

the phylogeny and evolution of drosophila mcm8
drosophila melanogaster was the only species sampled that did not show co-possession or co-absence of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  our general mcm phylogeny suggested that the d. melanogaster mcm <dig> protein was highly divergent . to further investigate the apparent loss of mcm <dig> and radical divergence of mcm <dig> in drosophila species we conducted an animal mcm <dig> and  <dig> phylogenetic analysis which included a sampling of all  <dig> drosophila genomes and additional insecta genome sequences, plus additional outgroups. the mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> comparative genomic analyses and phylogeny demonstrated the monophyletic groupings of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> and confirmed the absence of mcm <dig> in all the drosophila species . this analysis also demonstrated that the drosophila mcm <dig> cluster formed an extremely long branch within the animal mcm <dig> clade  suggesting a pattern of radical evolutionary change specifically in the drosophila mcm <dig> gene family. the divergence of drosophila mcm <dig> from other mcm <dig> sequences may be related to the absence of mcm <dig> in drosophila or a radical change in functional role.

gain and loss of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> in eukaryotic evolution
the comparative genomics studies of mcms have revealed that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> are widely distributed in  five of the six eukaryotic supergroups and only absent in some opisthokonts, excavates and chromalveolates. by adapting current understandings on the phylogenetic and taxonomic groupings of the eukaryotes  <cit>  it is possible to make some deductions about gain and loss events of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> across the eukaryotic evolutionary tree. the presence of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> in five of the six supergroups suggests that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> also arose early in eukaryotic evolution. mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> were both absent from all analysed fungal genomes, with the exception of encephalitozoon and batrachochytrium. in comparison to the current consensus fungal phylogeny  <cit> , these data suggest that the loss of mcm <dig> and  <dig> in the fungi was probably a shared loss event in the last common ancestor of the ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and zygomycetes sampled. further secondary loss events were identified in the apicomplexa cryptosporidium and in the animal caenorhabditis lineages.

mcm <dig> and  <dig> were absent in the excavates giardia and trichomonas which according to some schemes for the eukaryotic phylogeny are potentially the primary branch in the eukaryotic phylogeny  <cit> . since the root of the eukaryotic tree is still unclear, when the mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> paralogues originated within the eukaryotic phylogeny remains a puzzle. however, a homologue of mcm <dig> was detected as a partial sequence in genome survey sequences  data for the diplomonad spironucleus barkhanus, which is a close relative of giardia. this suggests that mcm <dig> and possibly mcm <dig> originated before the common ancestor of giardia and trichomonas branched from the base of the eukaryotic tree and that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> were also present in the lcea. this identifies at least two additional cases of mcm8- <dig> co-loss within the 'metamonads'  <cit>  including one loss in the diplomonads  and the parabasalids . together this suggests at least five separate cases of paired mcm <dig> and  <dig> loss during the eukaryotic radiation, providing indirect support for the hypothesis that mcm <dig> and  <dig> may have some currently unidentified interdependent functional roles.

reciprocity between mcm evolution and function studies
in most archaea, a single mcm forms a homohexamer. a number of archaeal mcms have been demonstrated to act as a helicase to unwind double-stranded dna  <cit> . helicase activity of eukaryotic mcms has been found in vitro in a sub-complex of mcm <dig>  mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  <cit>  or in a super-complex of mcm2- <dig> with cdc <dig> and gins accessory proteins  <cit> . the comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis of mcms have revealed that the lcea possessed all six mcm2- <dig> proteins, which seem to have diversified from a single archaeal-like, ancestral mcm. this suggests that the ancestral enzymatic activity of eukaryotic mcm2- <dig> proteins is unwinding dna as a processive helicase. because both eukaryotes and archaea have a functional complex of six individual mcms it is likely that early eukaryotes also had a six-protein mcm functional complex. however, eukaryotes replaced a single gene six-protein complex with a six gene six-protein complex.

mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> have received relatively few functional studies. mcm <dig> has been characterised recently in humans, xenopus and drosophila  <cit> . human and xenopus mcm <dig> function in dna replication, although there is no consensus regarding their exact role; early evidence suggested this may be in the elongation phase of dna replication  <cit> , but human mcm <dig> has also been shown to associate and co-localise with cdc <dig>  an mcm2- <dig> loading factor, implying a role in pre-rc formation  <cit> . the early evolutionary acquisitions of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> suggest that mcm <dig> in other eukaryotes might also have similar roles. the putative co-function of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> as demonstrated by the pattern of co-presence, co-loss and distinct co-ancestry suggests that mcm <dig> is also involved in dna replication; this is supported by the recent demonstration that that xenopus mcm <dig> acts as a positive regulator of the mcm2- <dig> loading factor cdt <dig> and is required for assembly of pre-replication complexes  <cit> . future comparative studies on mcm <dig> and  <dig> functions will be informative.

in addition, a role in meiotic recombination has been identified for the drosophila mcm <dig>  rec  <cit> . drosophila was the only eukaryote analysed which has mcm <dig> but lacks mcm <dig> suggesting, if the co-function and distinct co-ancestry hypothesis is correct, that rec may have assumed the function of both proteins or acquired a novel function that does not require mcm <dig> specifically in drosophila. mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> are therefore likely to co-function in meiotic recombination in other eukaryotic lineages, but further work is required to investigate this hypothesis. the loss of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> in some opisthokont lineages and cryptosporidium could mean that mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> are dispensable for meiotic recombination or other unknown functions. comparative genomics analyses of meiotic genes indicate that giardia possesses several protein components required for meiosis  <cit> . further studies should attempt to investigate and compare meiosis and mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> function between giardia and other eukaryotes capable of sexual reproduction and which encode mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> 

functional studies on mcm <dig> proteins suggest that mcm <dig> is required for both dna initiation and elongation phase of dna replication  <cit> . in yeast and xenopus, mcm <dig> binds to both chromatin and the mcm2- <dig> complex and recruits cdc <dig> and dna polymerase α-primase to replication origins  <cit> . mcm <dig> forms part of the replisome complex that migrates away from replication origins during s-phase  <cit>  and is required for stability and activity of the initiating polymerase, dna polymerase α-primase  <cit> . mcm <dig> homologues were found neither in archaea nor in eubacteria; the appearance of this protein seems to be unique within eukaryotes. the evolutionary pattern of mcm <dig>  indicates the importance and functional similarities of mcm <dig> homologues within the eukaryotic genomes analysed.

CONCLUSIONS
we have carried out a broad and deep phylogenetic analysis of mcm proteins involved in dna replication. eukaryote genomes encode up to nine such proteins all of which have an ancient origin and diversification within the eukaryotic lineage. subunits of the mcm2- <dig> hexamer appear to be universally present in eukaryotic taxa, as predicted by their likely dna helicase role in dna replication. mcm2- <dig> distribution demonstrates diversification by gene duplication prior to the lcea of extant eukaryotic supergroups. mcm <dig> and  <dig> paralogues exhibit a distribution pattern characteristic of interdependent loss events in some taxa. co-loss suggests related functions for mcm <dig> and  <dig>  which may play more peripheral roles in the cell than mcm2- <dig>  finally, the non-homologous mcm <dig> protein appears to be exclusively eukaryotic and exhibits greater sequence divergence across taxa than the mcm2- <dig> family.
