BACKGROUND
mental imagery is the process of envisioning specific physical or cognitive activities or perceptual experiences with the intention of altering the facilitation of neuronal networks  <cit> . mental imagery is a powerful tool in improving the performance of motor skills  <cit> , cognitive performance, and memory  <cit>  and is widely used in psychological/psychiatric treatments for such disorders as schizophrenia, social phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder  <cit> .

mental imagery modulates pain, and certain chronic pain syndromes are altered significantly by mental imagery, such as phantom limb pain  <cit> . the motor cortex is one neural circuit that can be altered with mental imagery to affect pain sensation . there is increasing evidence of the relationship between the motor cortex and pain modulation   <cit> .figure  <dig>

based on data from invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation  , there is a bidirectional relationship between pain and motor cortex excitability. pain perception modifies tms-indexed cortical excitability in various areas of the brain, including the motor cortex  <cit>  , and modification of motor cortex excitability with repetitive tms mitigates pain  <cit>  . thus, we hypothesized that mental imagery that is focused toward a specific hand will significantly modify tms-indexed cortical excitability and pain perception as indexed by quantitative sensory testing .

several studies have demonstrated enhanced cortical excitability during mental imagery tasks by measuring motor-evoked potentials  using tms  <cit> . thus, mental imagery is a proven cognitive tool that changes neuronal plasticity, allowing potential changes in cortical excitability to be correlated with modulations in pain.

in this study, we tested whether mental imagery-induced attention toward a painful stimulus of the hand alters the perception of pain, as measured by pressure pain threshold. we also measured changes in cortical excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation  to examine the neurophysiological mechanisms of pain attention. based on the number of outcomes in this study, we tested this hypothesis in an exploratory manner.

RESULTS
none of the participating subjects experienced any adverse effects. because our experimental setting demanded good compliance and attention, we monitored sleepiness and engagement during the experiment using a questionnaire. one subject was excluded from the experiment, because he fell asleep several times, and experimental adherence was not secured. there were no significant differences between groups in sleepiness or engagement .

moreover, we studied various age groups  and found no significant differences  in pain or tms outcome. furthermore we assessed whether there were baseline differences as well as treatment related differences in vas-anxiety and motor function as indexed by purdue pegboard test. all these analyses did not show significant results, confirming that these variables could not explain our results .table  <dig>

pain threshold
we analyzed the primary outcome of pain threshold as follows:i. we initially tested all pain results together. by anova with multiple factors for time, group, and hand, there were no significant interactions  . however, group had a main effect  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), confirming our initial hypothesis that mental imagery-induced attention has a significant effect on the perception of pain, regardless of hand and time .

ii. we then analyzed both hands separately, because only the left hand was targeted in our mental imagination experiment—the right hand served as an intraindividual control condition. we noted a significant result for the left hand for group  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), indicating that mental imagery versus controls had disparate effects on pain thresholds. we repeated the same analysis for the right hand  and found no significant results  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), confirming that the effects of pain threshold changes in the target hand were induced by the intervention .

iii. pain threshold of the left hand changed in the mental imagery group by- <dig>  kg  versus + <dig>  kg in the control group . however, by unpaired t-test, this difference was not significant . note that the baseline thresholds did not differ in either hand in any group .

because we targeted the left hand in the experiments, tms was assessed only over the right nondominant hemisphere. all tms analysis results are listed in table  <dig> 

we first tested whether cortical excitability changed significantly with of group and time as factors by anova . by anova, there were significant results for both groups  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

notably, baseline values did not differ between groups with regard to mep amplitude  and mep integral , indicating that the effects were not due to a baseline difference between groups. overall, mep decreased over time . expressed as percentages; mep in the mental imagery group decreased by  <dig> % versus  <dig> % in the control group. individual changes in mep are shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

we then determined whether the changes in pain threshold level were associated with modulations in cortical excitability by correlation analysis. shifts in pain threshold and mep amplitude correlated significantly , suggesting that a decline in pain threshold  decreases cortical excitability .figure  <dig>

we analyzed whether the effects were due to the experimental group. by anova with of group and time as factors for all cortical silent periods  with intensities of 110% , 120% , and 130% , there were significant results for group, confirming our findings from the pain analysis  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; anova for csp 120%: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; anova for csp 130% f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). this result indicates that the groups differed significantly in changes in tms measures. by anova of icf, we noted significant results for the experimental group  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), demonstrating that the cortical excitability in the mental imagery group changed disparately than in the control group.

sici was unchanged in both groups using t-tests  as well as interaction analyses .

we also performed linear regression analyses to test for confounders, but none revealed any significant results . thus, potential confounders, such as age, race, education level, state of engagement and sleepiness, anxiety level, and motor function ability , did not influence the results. no subject had a score that was higher than  <dig> , reflecting the absence of depressive symptoms .

discussion
in this exploratory study, we did not observe any significant effect of mental imagery on pain in our primary analysis. however, we noted a small effect in the exploratory within-group analyses. the targeted left hand experienced a decrease in pressure pain threshold, indicating a rise in pain perception. in contrast, pressure pain threshold rose in the controls, although, this within-group effect was modest. further analyses of tms assessments revealed a significant positive correlation of changes in pain and alterations in cortical excitability, suggesting that a decline in pain threshold decreases cortical excitability.

our results can be interpreted as unexpected, because the literature claims that meps increase significantly during voluntary or imagined movement of the finger  <cit> . also, studies on phantom limb pain suggest that the use of mental imagery is an effective method of reducing pain  <cit> . nevertheless, our findings demonstrate the opposite.

one explanation is that we included healthy subjects with an experimental pain model—not patients who were suffering from actual pain. because chronic pain patients have a deficient pain matrix and altered pain-related neural networks, such methods as mental imagery might induce differential effects in patients versus healthy subjects  <cit> . in previous studies, we found that motor tasks, sensory stimuli, and movement observation can change pressure pain threshold levels and cortical excitability  <cit>  , in which active tasks for one hand can ameliorate the perception of pain in the targeted hand. in contrast, we also found that the untargeted hand experienced a decrease in pain threshold, indicating greater perception of pain  <cit> .

in the current exploratory study, we generated data that suggest that the opposite effects are occurring, because attention and expecting pain indicated enhanced perception of pain. thus, our findings implicated a close, reciprocal relationship of these two emotional and alertness states. consistent with our modest effects on pain, these effects have been confirmed by several studies  <cit> .

in a separate study, we demonstrated that changes in pain correlate significantly with modulations in tms assessments, as in our present report  <cit> . in that study, we tested movement observation by showing a video, which was intended to be a distraction to a painful stimulus  <cit>  . pain threshold levels increased, reflecting a decline in the perception of pain  <cit> . this finding is consistent with our current results, which yielded the opposite effects in both outcomes. subjects paid attention to the hand and focused on the painful stimuli, which effected a moderate decrease in pressure pain levels, thus indicating pain sensitization. further, previous evidence has shown that cortical excitability and pain significantly correlate in chronic pain patients  <cit> , supporting our exploratory findings.

the modest within-group effects seen in this article suggest that complex processes, such as distraction and concentration, and influences of attentional processes have an impact on pain perception  <cit> . for instance, paying attention to pain, focusing on a painful body part, and rumination of painful stimuli are components of pain catastrophizing  <cit> . in our experiment, we mimicked attention to a specific body part and placed the focus on painful stimuli on the same area. thus, we might be able to mimic one part of the complex mechanism of pain catastrophizing and attention-modified pain perception in healthy subjects.

moreover, cortical excitability is significantly associated with pain coping strategies, such as pain catastrophizing, supporting our findings that cortical excitability results correlate significantly with pain outcome  <cit> . a subsequent study with a larger sample size should be performed to determine the predictors of pain catastrophizing and test interventions to prevent attention, focusing, and rumination on pain. the mechanism of pain augmentation must be determined to develop novel targeted therapies for chronic pain conditions.

there are some limitations in our study. first, we assessed tms on one hemisphere, because only the left hand was the target in our experimental setting—cortical excitability changes were not measured in the other hemisphere. however, because there was no significant effect of pain threshold in the non-targeted right hand, we assumed that there was no such effect on the non-targeted left hemisphere. further, studies with larger sample sizes that include chronic pain patients are necessary to confirm the results and to show the differences in pain processing between healthy subjects and chronic pain patients.

also, the age difference between subjects could be a limitation. although there no significant differences between younger and older subjects, we cannot exclude that age has an influence on our results. in addition, with regard to limitations due to the statistical results: we did not find any significant interactions—only a modest within-group effect on pain outcome was noted.

CONCLUSIONS
mental imagery-induced attention and focusing on a painful stimulus of a specific body part might enhance the perception of pain. our findings highlight the effects and influence of attentional processes on pain perception, which might be components of the mechanisms of pain catastrophizing and chronification, because both phenomena include recurring attention on pain and a painful body part. further, cortical plasticity changes in the same direction as those in pain perception. these exploratory findings suggest that neuronal plasticity is governed by pain and that pain-related neural networks are altered by the attention state.
