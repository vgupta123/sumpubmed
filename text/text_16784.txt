BACKGROUND
bacteria employ sophisticated cell-to-cell communication networks which instigate population-wide behavioural changes in response to environment stimuli. such population-dependent adaptive behaviour results in altered gene expression in response to the production and sensing of chemical information in the form of diffusible signal molecules, commonly referred to as autoinducers. the process, whereby an increase in the concentration of signal molecule in the extracellular milieu reflects cell population density is called 'quorum sensing' . at a threshold concentration of the qs signal molecule , the target genes are induced or repressed. in different bacterial genera, these may include genes which code for the production of secondary metabolites, plasmid transfer, motility, virulence, and biofilm development .

in many gram-negative bacteria, qs depends on the actions of n-acylhomoserine lactone  signal molecules  <cit> . these consist of a homoserine lactone ring linked via a saturated or unsaturated acyl chain  and without or with a keto or hydroxy substituent at the c3-position . ahl biosynthesis primarily depends on the actions of enzymes belonging to the luxi or luxm protein families while the response to an ahl is usually driven by the interaction between the signal molecule and a member of the luxr protein family of response regulators  <cit> .

since qs controls a range of biological functions associated with virulence and as the emergence of multi-antibiotic resistant bacterial strains is in the ascendency, there is increasing pressure to discover novel therapeutic approaches to combat bacterial infections  <cit> . interrupting qs may represent one such method which has the added advantage that the targets are not normally essential for bacterial survival and therefore are not subject to the same selective pressures observed for conventional growth inhibitory antimicrobials  <cit> .

quorum quenching  refers to the process in which qs is disrupted. qq can be achieved in several ways such as through the enzymatic destruction of qs signal molecules, the development of antibodies to qs signal molecules or via agents which block qs. in this context both the qs signal synthase and sensor or response regulator proteins are the primary targets  <cit> .

under alkaline conditions ahls are rapidly inactivated by ph-dependent lactonolysis in which the homoserine lactone ring is hydrolysed to the ring open form  in a reaction which can be reversed by acidification  <cit> . this reaction can also be driven enzymatically by lactonases such as aiia, attm, aiib  <cit>  and ahld  <cit> . there is also a second class of ahl-degrading enzymes which are amidases/acylases such as aiid  <cit>  and pvdq  <cit>  which cleave the ahl amide bond releasing homoserine lactone and the corresponding fatty acid.

the ability to inactivate ahls enzymatically is shared by diverse bacteria belonging to the α-proteobacteria including agrobacterium, sphingomonas, sphingopyxis and bosea, the β-proteobacteria such as variovorax, ralstonia and comamonas, the γ-proteobacteria including pseudomonas and acinetobacter, firmicutes such as bacillus and actinobacteria such as rhodococcus as well as the streptomyces sp. .

since qs often controls virulence in both plant and animal pathogens  <cit> , qq bacteria have potential as biocontrol agents which protect plants from pathogens while novel ahl-inactivating enzymes may have utility as therapeutic agents  <cit> . consequently, we have been exploring novel rhizosphere environments for bacterial communities displaying both ahl-dependent qs and ahl-degrading activities. since both beneficial rhizosphere bacteria and pathogens may use the same or very similar ahls, it is important that qq directed toward the latter do not perturb the former  <cit> . hence the identification of strains expressing highly specific qq enzymes would have significant utility. here we focus on the ahl-inactivating activities of a community of bacteria associated with the roots of zingiber officinale  growing in the malaysian rainforest. three ahl-inactivating bacteria belonging to the genera acinetobacter, burkholderia and klebsiella were identified and isolated using an enrichment assay employing n-homoserine lactone  as the sole nitrogen and carbon source. while the acinetobacter and klebsiella strains both exhibited broad spectrum lactonase activity, the burkholderia strain reduced 3-oxo-ahls to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds. the acinetobacter and burkholderia strains both possessed ahl-producing and ahl-inactivating activities and in co-culture experiments we show that all three ginger rhizosphere isolates are capable of reducing the production of key p. aeruginosa qs-dependent virulence determinants and erwinia carotovora-mediated tissue damage in a potato tuber infection model.

RESULTS
selection of qq bacteria from ginger rhizosphere
to enrich for rhizosphere-associated bacteria with ahl-degrading capabilities, a ginger rhizosphere suspension was used to inoculate a basal medium containing 3-oxo-c6-hsl as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen  <cit> . bacterial growth was evident within  <dig> h but only in the samples containing 3-oxo-c6-hsl . the enrichment culture was plated onto solidified basal kg medium  <cit>  containing 3-oxo-c6-hsl which was passaged for single colonies which were subcultured on lb agar. seven ginger rhizosphere-associated bacteria with four distinctive morphotypes  were chosen for further study.

the ginger rhizosphere strains were identified by 16s rdna sequencing and analysis of the aligned sequences  was performed by web-based similarity searches against the genbank database. the strains were identified as acinetobacter spp. , burkholderia spp. , klebsiella sp.  and microbacterium sp. . since the 16s rdna sequence data indicated that gg <dig>  gg <dig> and gg <dig> are very closely related to gg <dig>  gg <dig> and se <dig> respectively, we chose to focus on gg <dig>  gg <dig> and se <dig>  ggp was also omitted from further investigation. the gg <dig> 16s rdna sequence showed 99% identity with acinetobacter spp. and clustered phylogenetically with acinetobacter calcoaceticus  and a poorly characterized acinetobacter sp. ). the gg <dig> 16s rdna shared 99% sequence identity with burkholderia cepacia pre <dig> . the accession numbers for the 16s rdna sequences of acinetobacter sp.  , burkholderia sp.   and klebsiella sp.   have been deposited with genbank.

the 3-oxo-c6-hsl-inactivating activity of each strain was assessed, and figure  <dig> shows the lack of any residual 3-oxo-c6-hsl after incubation with gg <dig> or with se <dig> for  <dig> h. however, 3-oxo-c6-hsl was still detected after incubation with gg <dig> cells for  <dig> h .

characterization of qq activities of acinetobacter gg <dig>  burkholderia gg <dig> and klebsiella se14
to determine the range of ahls inactivated by each of the three ginger rhizosphere isolates, whole cells resuspended in pbs buffer were incubated for up to  <dig> h with a range of ahls differing in acyl chain length , the presence or absence of a c <dig> substituent  or with a series of 3-hydroxy-c14-hsls with a double bond at either c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> or c <dig> . after incubation, any remaining ahls were detected using the appropriate ahl biosensor as described in the methods section and compared with escherichia coli dh5α and pbs as negative controls. the data obtained are summarized in table  <dig>  using biosensor assays klebsiella se <dig> inactivated all of the ahls tested while acinetobacter gg <dig> showed broad activity but was most effective against the long chain unsubstituted or 3-hydroxy substituted saturated or unsaturated acyl chain-ahls . burkholderia gg <dig> exhibited no apparent activity against the ahls using these biosensor assays .

degradation of ahls by gg <dig> and se <dig>  degradation of ahl: + : weak; ++ : moderate; + + + : significant. insets denote the digital image of ahls detected using the biosensors e. coli  and/or e. coli ; evaluated according to the reduction in bioluminescence. all experiments took into account the detection limit of the biosensors used for each ahl-degradation assay.

since natural ahls are in the l-configuration, we sought to determine whether the ahl inactivating activities observed were stereospecific. after incubation of gg <dig> and se <dig> whole cells with the d-isomer of 3-oxo-c6-hsl , the reaction mixture was extracted and analysed by hplc rather than using the ahl biosensors which do not respond to d-isomers. for gg <dig> and se <dig> the peak corresponding to 3-oxo-c6-d-hsl was reduced after  <dig> h incubation and effectively absent after  <dig> h. the data for acinetobacter strain gg <dig> are shown in figure 2a. similar results were obtained for se <dig>  indicating that ahl inactivation by these two ginger rhizosphere bacteria is not stereospecific. although the biosensor assays did not demonstrate any ahl inactivation for burkholderia gg <dig>  hplc analysis revealed that the peak corresponding to 3-oxo-c6-d-hsl was reduced with the concomitant appearance of a new peak  suggesting that gg <dig> was capable of modifying ahls.

identification of the ahl degradation products
to determine whether acinetobacter strain gg <dig> inactivated ahls through cleavage of the acyl chain or via lactonolysis or both, 3-oxo-c6-hsl was first incubated with gg <dig> cells for  <dig> h. the cells were removed and the supernatant was collected, acidified to ph  <dig> and incubated for a further  <dig> h. this results in the ph-mediated re-cyclization of any ring opened compound present  <cit>  which was subsequently detected using the c. violaceum cv <dig> ahl biosensor  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that while no 3-oxo-c6-hsl was detected in the supernatant after  <dig> h incubation with gg <dig>  it could be recovered by acidification indicating that gg <dig> possesses lactonase activity. to investigate whether gg <dig> also exhibits amidase activity a cell-free gg <dig>  <dig> h culture supernatant grown in the presence of 3-oxo-c6-hsl was treated with dansyl chloride which reacts with the exposed free amine of the homoserine lactone ring following release of the ahl acyl chain  <cit> . no dansylated homoserine lactone was detected indicating that gg <dig> does not exhibit acylase activity .

similar acidification experiments to those described above for acinetobacter gg <dig> were carried out for klebsiella se <dig>  these showed that se <dig> also possesses a lactonase. since klebsiella pneumoniae has previously been reported  <cit>  to possess a homologue of the arthrobacter lactonase gene ahld termed ahlk, we used primers based on ahlk to determine whether the gene was also present in se <dig>  a single pcr product was obtained and sequenced and found to be identical to the ahlk gene . when se <dig> ahlk was expressed in e. coli dh5α, ahl biosensor assays revealed that there was a reduction in bioluminescence consistent with a decrease in 3-oxo-c6-hsl when compared to the vector control. upon acidification of the supernatant ahl biosensor activity could be restored thus confirming that ahlk has lactonase activity .

when burkholderia strain gg <dig> was incubated with 3-oxo-c6-d-hsl for  <dig> h and examined by hplc, we noted the appearance of a new peak  that was absent when either gg <dig> or se <dig> was incubated with the same d-isomer  . similar results were obtained following incubation of the natural l-isomer of 3-oxo-c6-hsl with gg <dig> and the new peak was found to co-migrate with the l-isomer of 3-hydroxy-c6-hsl  suggesting that gg <dig> has oxido-reductase activity towards 3-oxo-ahls. to confirm the oxido-reductase activity of gg <dig>  3-oxo-c6-l-hsl incubated with gg <dig> for  <dig> h and  <dig> h was analysed by mass spectrometry and the appearance of 3-hydroxy-c6-hsl was confirmed by detection of the precursor ion ) and fragment ions of m/z  <dig>   and  <dig>   which are characteristic of 3-hydroxy-ahls which readily lose a water molecule and the homoserine lactone moiety respectively  <cit> .

similar results were obtained on incubation of gg <dig> with the l-isomers of 3-oxo-c4-hsl or 3-oxo-c8-hsl in that new hplc peaks co-eluting with 3-hydroxy-c4-hsl and 3-hydroxy-c8-hsl synthetic standards, respectively, were observed after incubation for  <dig> h . this oxido-reductase activity was only apparent when 3-oxo-ahls were incubated with gg <dig> whole cells but not cell lysates .

acinetobacter gg <dig> and burkholderia gg <dig> produce ahls
since some but not all acinetobacter and burkholderia strains have previously been reported to produce ahls, we wondered whether qq and qs activities co-exist in gg <dig>  gg <dig> and se <dig>  to determine whether any of the three ginger rhizosphere strains produced ahls, they were first cross-streaked against each of three different ahl biosensors namely c. violaceum cv <dig>  e. coli  and e. coli , and the plates examined over time for the induction of violacein or bioluminescence . gg <dig> induced bioluminescence in e. coli  indicating that it was producing long chain ahls, gg <dig> activated both cv <dig> and e. coli  indicative of short chain ahl production while se <dig> failed to activate any of the three ahl biosensors.

to identify unequivocally the ahls produced by gg <dig>  spent culture supernatant extracts were analysed by liquid chromatography  coupled to hybrid quadruple-linear ion trap mass spectrometry , which revealed the presence of 3-oxo-c12-hsl and 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl by comparison of their retention times, precursor and principal fragment ions with synthetic standards. figure  <dig> shows the fragmentation patterns for 3-oxo-c12-hsl  and 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl  . the mass spectra of the extracted ahls were similar to the corresponding synthetic compounds. quantitative analysis by lc-ms/ms of the ahls produced by gg <dig> over a  <dig> h period revealed that 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl was the most abundant ahl produced by gg <dig> which attains a maximum level after  <dig> h growth, but is almost undetectable after  <dig> h .

lc-ms/ms analysis of gg <dig> supernatants confirmed the presence of 3-oxo-c6-hsl ; c8-hsl , 3-hydroxy-c8-hsl  and c9-hsl  . the mass spectra of the extracted ahls were indistinguishable from the corresponding synthetic compounds .

qq biocontrol activity of the ginger rhizosphere isolates
to determine whether any of the three ginger rhizosphere bacterial isolates were capable of quenching virulence factor production in human  and plant  pathogens which utilize different ahls, we undertook co-culture experiments. figure 4a shows that acinetobacter gg <dig> and burkholderia gg <dig> both reduced elastase production approximately two-fold when compared to the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> control whereas the klebsiella strain se <dig> was the most effective, reducing elastase levels about 16-fold. none of the qq bacteria inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa which reached a similar viable count in co-culture as was attained in monoculture . gg <dig> and se <dig> both effectively reduced the expression of leca in p. aeruginosa although gg <dig> had comparatively little effect .

the qq potential of gg <dig>  gg <dig> and se <dig> for attenuating the 3-oxo-c6-hsl-dependent pectinolytic activity of er. carotovora was assessed in planta using a potato tuber infection model after viable count experiments confirmed that none of the strains affected the growth of er. carotovora in co-culture experiments . er. carotovora causes substantial tissue necrosis when injected into the potato tuber but when co-cultured with any of the three ginger rhizosphere isolates, maceration of the potato tissue by the phytopathogen was greatly reduced .

discussion
in the present work, four bacterial morphotypes from the same ginger rhizosphere bacterial community were isolated and identified as a consequence of their ability to grow on an enrichment medium  <cit>  containing 3-oxo-c6-hsl as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. blast search analyses of the 16s rdna sequences identified the strains as belonging to the genera acinetobacter, burkholderia, klebsiella and microbacterium. in semi-quantitative whole cell assays, we evaluated the ahl-inactivating spectrum of the three gram-negative isolates. the broadest range of activity was noted for klebsiella strain se <dig> which inactivated each of the  <dig> structurally diverse ahls evaluated including the d-isomer of 3-oxo-c6-hsl. similarly acinetobacter strain gg <dig> exhibited a broad spectrum of activity but was less effective against short chain ahls. in contrast, burkholderia gg <dig> was inactive against the unsubstituted ahls but was active against the 3-oxo-ahls. although ahl-degrading activity has not previously been characterized in the genus burkholderia, a soil isolate from this genus capable of growing on ahls as the sole nitrogen but not carbon source was reported by yang et al  <cit> . this differs from burkholderia strain gg <dig> which did not grow on 3-oxo-c6-hsl as a source of both carbon and nitrogen and probably came through the enrichment process as a consequence of ahl turnover by the other bacteria in the ginger rhizosphere community. nevertheless, when gg <dig> was incubated with 3-oxo-c6-hsl in pbs buffer, gg <dig> reduced this ahl to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compound. similar results were obtained for 3-oxo-c4-hsl and 3-oxo-c8-hsl as well as the d-isomer of 3-oxo-c6-hsl indicating that the activity was not ahl chain length dependent or stereospecific. this simple reduction of a 3-oxo-ahl to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compound is likely to impact on qq. for example, in er. carotovora where carbapenem antibiotic biosynthesis and exoenzyme production are regulated by 3-oxo-c6-hsl, the corresponding 3-hydroxy compound has only 1% of the activity of the 3-oxo-ahl  <cit> . for p. aeruginosa, the 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl was approximately 8-fold less active than the 3-oxo compound  <cit> . these data suggest that simple modification of the 3-oxo moiety is likely to substantially reduce the activity of 3-oxo-ahls and to contribute to the qq activity within a bacterial community. a similar oxido-reductase activity has been observed for a strain of rhodococcus erythropolis isolated from the tobacco rhizosphere  <cit> . in contrast to burkholderia strain gg <dig>  this gram positive bacterium  was unable to reduce 3-oxo-c6-hsl and required an ahl acyl chain of at least eight carbons  <cit> . however in common with gg <dig>  the activity was only observed on incubation of 3-oxo-ahls with whole, live bacterial cells as cell lysates were inactive  <cit> .

for klebsiella and acinetobacter, ahl-inactivating activity has previously been noted by park et al  <cit>  and kang et al  <cit> , respectively. for the former, an ahl-degrading enzyme  related to ahld from arthrobacter has been cloned and sequenced and by homology suggested to be a lactonase  <cit> . here we have shown that the same gene is conserved in the klebsiella ginger rhizosphere isolate se <dig> and have demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme expressed in e. coli is indeed a lactonase with very broad ahl-inactivating activity including both short and long chain ahls . these include n-homoserine lactone , an ahl which was originally termed the rhizobium small bacteriocin  <cit>  because it inhibits the growth of rhizobium leguminosarum strains which carry a 'sensitivity locus' on sym plasmids such as prlj <dig>  <cit> . 3-hydroxy-c14:1-hsl is also produced by soil bacteria such as pseudomonas fluorescens  <cit> .

acinetobacter gg <dig> also degraded a wide range of short and long chain ahls via a lactonase activity although we were unable to identify the gene involved. although the mechanism of ahl degradation has not previously been determined in this genus, an acinetobacter strain isolated from cucumber rhizosphere has been reported to degrade both c6-hsl and n-octadecanoyl homoserine lactone  as well as the ahls produced by a biocontrol strain of pseudomonas chlororaphis and a phytopathogenic strain of burkholderia glumae  <cit> . interestingly, acinetobacter gg <dig> not only degrades ahls but also produces ahls which we identified as 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl  and c12-hsl . previously niu et al  <cit>  showed that the human nosocomial pathogen, acinetobacter baumannii, produces 3-hydroxy-c12-hsl and c12-hsl via the luxi synthase, abai, the expression of which is ahl dependent. in a. baumannii, ahl-dependent qs appears to contribute to biofilm development since abai mutants were less biofilm proficient than the parent strain  <cit> .

acinetobacter strains isolated from contact lenses have been reported not to produce any ahls  <cit>  whereas a study of  <dig> acinetobacter strains isolated from both hospital patients and the environment and assayed using ahl biosensors showed that most of the strains examined produced ahls although these were not chemically characterized  <cit> . furthermore a comparative genome analysis of three different acinetobacter strains from three different environments revealed the presence of a luxir-type locus in a multidrug resistant clinical a. baumannii isolate which was disrupted by an insertion element in a sensitive strain isolated from human body lice but completely absent from a soil isolate  <cit> .

in acinetobacter gg <dig>  3-hydroxy-c12-hsl accumulated in the growth medium reaching a maximal level after  <dig> h before rapidly being degraded. this indicates gg <dig> tightly controls its own ahl production and turnover and suggests that sustained expression  of the qs target genes is not required in stationary phase. the coupling of ahl synthesis and degradation in the same bacterium has previously been noted for agrobacterium tumefaciens which produces and degrades 3-oxo-c8-hsl during early stationary phase via a lactonase encoded by attm which is activated by starvation signals and the stress alarmone ppgpp  <cit> . similarly, a marine shewanella strain which produces ahls in late exponential phase degraded its long chain ahls in stationary phase via both lactonase and acylase/amidase activities  <cit> . in polymicrobial biofilms, this shewanella isolate interfered with ahl production in other bacteria and as a consequence, their ability to enhance the settlement of algal zoospores was compromised  <cit> . here, we also found that the ginger rhizosphere burkholderia isolate gg <dig> is not only capable of interfering with qs by reducing 3-oxo-ahls to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds but also produces ahls including 3-oxo-c6-hsl, c9-hsl and 3-hydroxy-c8-hsl. while most burkholderia strains synthesize c6-hsl and c8-hsl  <cit> , 3-hydroxy-c8-hsl production has only been confirmed in the pathogen, burkholderia mallei  <cit>  and tentatively identified in the environmental non-pathogenic burkholderia xenovorans  <cit> . in b. mallei, c8-hsl and 3-hydroxy-c8-hsl are produced by two different ahl synthases   <cit> . in burkholderia gg <dig>  it remains to be established whether 3-hydroxy-c8-hsl is produced directly via a luxi-type synthase or is a consequence of the reduction of 3-oxo-c8-hsl.

bacteria such as gg <dig>  gg <dig> and se <dig> which produce and/or modify/degrade qs signals are likely to have a major impact on the properties of polymicrobial bacterial communities. here we have shown that the ginger rhizosphere isolates were each capable of reducing virulence factor production in both p. aeruginosa and er. carotovora. however, gg <dig> was unable to down-regulate leca  expression probably as a consequence of its inability to reduce c4-hsl  <cit>  in contrast to elastase which is predominantly lasr/3-oxo-c12-hsl dependent  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
three different qq bacteria associated with the ginger rhizosphere have been isolated and characterized as belonging to the genera acinetobacter , burkholderia  and klebsiella . gg <dig> and se <dig> exhibited the broadest spectrum of ahl degrading activity via lactonolysis while gg <dig> reduced 3-oxo-ahls to the corresponding 3-hydroxy compounds. in gg <dig> and gg <dig>  ahl-dependent qq co-exists with ahl-dependent qs suggesting that these bacteria are likely to play a major role in determining the qs-dependent phenotype of the polymicrobial community from which they were isolated. this was confirmed by co-culture experiments in which all three rhizosphere bacteria attenuated virulence factor production in both a human and a plant pathogen without inhibiting growth of either pathogen.
