BACKGROUND
paramyxoviruses are well-known pathogens of the central nervous and respiratory systems of many host species. in the last few decades, many novel paramyxoviruses have emerged causing devastating illnesses in different aquatic and terrestrial animals, including in some cases a species jump to humans  <cit> . parainfluenza virus type  <dig>  is an enveloped, single-stranded negative sense rna virus within the respirovirus genus of the paramyxoviridae family  <cit> . the respirovirus genus includes human parainfluenza virus types  <dig> and  <dig> , sendai virus  and bovine parainfluenza virus type  <dig>   <cit> . in some instances when animals are subjected to high stressful conditions, infection with bpiv <dig> can contribute to tissue damage and immunosuppression, resulting in severe bronchopneumonia from secondary bacterial infections  <cit> . the resulting disease is part of the bovine respiratory disease complex  and is considered as the most significant illness associated with feedlot cattle in the usa  <cit> , and possibly worldwide. other respiratory viruses such as bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  bovine viral diarrhea virus  and bovine respiratory syncytial virus  have also been associated with brdc development in feedlot cattle  <cit> . the clinical presentation of bovine infections with bpiv <dig> can vary considerably, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe respiratory illness. in most cases where bpiv <dig> is implicated in disease, usual clinical signs include coughing, fever and nasal discharge  <cit> .

three genotypes, a , b  and c  have been described, based on genetic and phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . the bpiv3b genotype could hypothetically be a lineage from a strain that recently crossed from another host species into cattle  <cit> . piv <dig> infections were found in a wide variety of mammals including cattle, humans, sheep  <cit> , goats  <cit> , bison  <cit> , guinea pigs  <cit> , black and white rhinoceros  <cit> , moose  <cit> , bighorn sheep  <cit>  and camels  <cit> . cross-species infections have been reported in numerous instances, including hpiv- <dig> in guinea pigs  <cit> , bpiv <dig> in a human, bpiv <dig> in sheep, and ovine piv <dig> in cattle  <cit> . in argentina, serological studies conducted in  <dig> and  <dig> showed a high incidence of antibodies against bpiv <dig>  in cattle from the main livestock breeding regions  <cit> . in addition, positive serology was reported in domestic and wild south american camelids  <cit>  and the virus was isolated from cattle and sheep  <cit> . however, little is known about the circulation of bpiv <dig> in cattle and other ruminants in argentina, as well as about the genotypes that are present in this southern american country.

production systems have evolved to mixed managements, where alternative production species, such as the water buffalo , coexist in the same habitat as with cattle. water buffalo breeding represents an important economic alternative in argentina, which allows access to national and international markets. this species is susceptible to several viral infections  <cit>  including bpiv <dig> as reported in a very early in  <dig> in egypt  <cit> . in addition to its potential relevance with respect to water buffalo health, this finding bears epidemiological significance due to the risk of transmission of the virus to cattle. the aim of this study was to characterize antigenically and genetically bpiv <dig> isolates from a respiratory and reproductive syndrome outbreak in dairy buffaloes and compare the buffalo isolate with contemporaneous bpiv <dig> circulating in cattle.

RESULTS
morphological and biological properties of buffalo viral isolates
piv <dig> was successfully isolated from two out of twelve water buffaloes studied, in one case from both nasal  and vaginal  swabs, and in the other only from the vaginal swab .

isolates produced characteristic cytopathic effects  on mdbk cells, similar to those of the bpiv <dig> reference strain, with many scattered, rounded, refractory cells and small syncytia. cpe were first visualized on the second passage, after three days post inoculation , and cpe were observed at day  <dig> or  <dig> dpi. both bovine polyclonal anti-bpiv <dig> serum and fitc-anti-bpiv <dig> igg reacted with the cells infected by these isolates .

transmission electron microscopy revealed spherical to pleomorphic virions, approximately 100–300 nm in diameter, which were morphologically indistinguishable from paramyxoviruses. intact virions were enveloped and densely packed, as has been described for bpiv <dig>  nucleocapsids were visible and exhibited a typical “herringbone” pattern .

the three isolates  were able to agglutinate red blood cells , with uha titers of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the agglutinated rbcs eluted after 1 h suggesting neuraminidase function/activity. the hi test showed 58% of positive reactions, with titers ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

molecular characterization rt-pcr and sequencing
a fragment of the m gene, consistent with the expected size of 328 bp was amplified from the  <dig> virus isolates  by rt-pcr. as expected, the primer pairs did not amplify using genomic material of brsv as template. analysis of the alignments of  <dig> pb of the corresponding sequences revealed that they are related to bpiv <dig> strain q <dig> from australia with 94% nucleotide identity  and 100% predicted amino acid identity .

id: identical; ref: reference.

data and phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic analysis of the m gene fragment of the three argentinean buffalo isolates  together with other paramyxoviruses, placed the buffalo isolates in the same clade as bpiv <dig> .

in particular, the isolates grouped with the bpiv3b genotype represented in the tree by an australian isolate . bpiv3b is distinct from the previously characterized members of bpiv <dig> represented by genotypes a and c.

in order to determine whether the piv <dig> genotype found in buffalo is also circulating in cattle, the same gene fragment was amplified by rt-pcr using as template bpiv <dig> rna isolated from six bovines of the buenos aires region. three of the six isolates show 98% nucleotide identity and 100% amino acid identity with bpiv3c  reference isolate, and the remaining three, 99% nucleotide identity and 100% amino acid identity with bpiv3a  reference isolate . phylogenetic characterization showed that the bovine isolates belong to the bpiv3a and bpiv3c genotypes, which have been reported so far in north america, europe and china .

serum neutralization test
buffalo sera  were analyzed by cross-neutralization, three were negative for both viruses, bpiv3a and b,  <dig> showed higher titers against bpiv3b isolated from buffalo,  <dig> showed higher titers against bpiv3a and the remaining  <dig> had same titers for both viruses. . in general, sera from buffaloes showed higher antibody titers against the isolated buffalo virus than against the reference virus.

* neutralization titers were calculated as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the last dilution with clear cytopathic effects.

each cell contains the number of animals with the antibody titers against each virus.

discussion
in the present study, we describe the isolation of bpiv <dig> from two water buffaloes with respiratory and reproductive signs. the virus was isolated from nasal and vaginal swabs from two out of twelve animals with reproductive and respiratory signs studied. to our knowledge little is known about the pathogenesis of this virus in buffalo. should there be a syndrome similar to that present in cattle where the virus is transiently excreted  <cit> , the unsuccessful virus isolation from the then remaining symptomatic animals could be related to the time point of sampling, which could have taken place at the end of the acute infection.

the if assay showed strong and specific binding of anti-bpiv <dig> antibodies to cells infected with these three positive clinical isolates. sera from buffaloes were able to neutralize the activity of the 7 n, 7 v and 2 v isolates and that of the reference bovine virus , but the neutralization titers against the latter were lower than against buffalo isolates, suggesting antigenic differences.

the sequence of the m amplified fragment showed 94% nucleotide identity between buffalo isolates and bpiv3b strain q <dig> from australia  <cit> . this is the first report of molecular characterization of a bpiv <dig> isolated from buffaloes. in order to determine homology between piv <dig> isolates from argentinean bovine and buffaloes, we characterized retrospectively six isolates collected from bovine respiratory outbreaks that occurred in  <dig> and  <dig>  these isolates showed high percentages of nucleotide and amino acid identity with a and c genotypes . there are only few reports about bpiv <dig> circulation in argentina, epstein et al described the isolation, virological and physicochemical characterization of piv <dig> from argentinean cattle and sheep in  <dig>  <cit> . however, phylogenetic studies of these isolates were not carried out. phylogenetic reconstructions based on the alignment of the m-gene nucleotide sequences demonstrated that the 7 n, 7 v and 2 v isolates clustered in the b genotype group. so far, this genotype has only been previously reported in australia  <cit> . the phylogenetic position of the argentinean buffalo isolates might be correlated with the antigenic differences observed by cross-neutralization studies, where the reference strain belonging to the bpiv3a group was lesser neutralized than the buffalo viral isolates by sera of buffaloes. therefore the serological and molecular characterization of buffalo bpvi <dig> isolates show that these viruses are more similar to b than to a  and c bpvi <dig> genotypes . interestingly, the genotype b isolated from buffaloes was not found among the bovine samples, analyzed in this work, that clustered with genotypes a and c. genotype b was until now observed only in australia with the hypothesis of a recent crossing from another species into cattle  <cit> . this evidence of genotype b in buffaloes should need further investigation to know if this species could be one of the host species of this genotype. therefore analysis of a larger number of isolates from cattle and buffaloes is needed to determine whether the three genotypes circulate in both species, or if the distribution observed is representative. importantly, this is the first report of bovine b and c genotype circulation out of australia and china, respectively. the circulation of genotype c only in china was attributed to a geographic restriction  <cit> . this hypothesis can be ruled out by our results and this observation was most likely due to the relative frequencies of these genotypes with respect to the samples analyzed.

to our knowledge this is the first report of the isolation of a parainfluenza virus type  <dig> from vaginal secretions. however, it is important to highlight that the presence of the virus in the secretions could be due to oro-genital contact between animals. evidence of viral replication in the genital mucosa needs new investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation and characterization of bpiv <dig> from water buffaloes were reported. we identified the isolates as bovine parainfluenza virus type  <dig> genotype b that differs from genotypes a and c circulating in argentinean cattle herds reported so far. further studies would be required to determine if a and c genotypes also circulate in buffalo herds, as well as to elucidate the role of buffalo as reservoirs, especially of the b genotype, and in the transmission of this virus to cattle.
