BACKGROUND
rna interference  can be triggered by introduction of long double-stranded rna molecules  in cells  <cit> , and proceeds in a number of sequential steps, starting with the cleavage of long dsrnas into shorter ≈ 21– <dig> nucleotide-long dsrnas called short interfering rnas . the enzyme responsible for this chopping  displays rnase iii activity, producing characteristic sirnas with a phosphorylated 5' end and a two nucleotide-overhanging 3'oh end. these sirnas enter an rna-induced silencing complex, or risc  <cit> . a helicase activity unwinds the two strands of the sirna, and risc scans the mrnas in the cytoplasm and cleaves the molecules that are found complementary to the risc-contained sirna  <cit> .

rna-silencing processes have been described in a variety of organisms: post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants  <cit> , quelling in fungi  <cit> , homology-dependent gene silencing in ciliates  <cit> , or rna interference in worms  <cit> , flies  <cit> , trypanosomes  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . it is thought that this machinery has evolved to protect cells against undesirable rnas, like rna viruses in plants  <cit> , or to limit the mobility of transposable elements in animals  <cit> .

while rnai and associated phenomena constitute exceptional recent basic science findings, they also provided a basis for the elaboration of powerful research tools. rnai methodologies have been set up to perform reverse-genetics studies in a number of organisms. rnai potency and flexibility have allowed to perform high-throughput genetic screens in several organisms  <cit> . in mammalian cells, the presence of long dsrna  triggers the activation of sequence-unspecific interferon-related pathways  <cit> . to circumvent this difficulty, researchers resorted to the transfection of small interfering rnas  <cit>  or in vivo synthesis of small hairpin rnas, which were demonstrated to produce gene-specific silencing  <cit> ; reviewed in  <cit> .

however, an sirna might trigger a number of potential unspecific events such as the degradation of partially complementary mrna due to cross-hybridization, leading to unspecific rnai, or the translational arrest due to a micro rna-like effect where an sirna hybridizes to a mrna with one or few mismatches. it is thus of paramount importance to ensure that the phenotypic effects observed as a result of sirna presence in cells are due to silencing of the target gene only. two large-scale studies show that sirna-induced gene silencing of transiently- or stably-expressed mrna is highly gene-specific and does not produce secondary effects detectable by genome-wide expression profiling  <cit> . in contrast, other works provided evidence that sirnas can be target-unspecific, with the observation of silencing of genes that had limited sequence homology with the sirna  <cit> . these reports should prompt scientists to assess the specificity of rnai-silencing in any experiment. a solution to that problem, that we devised in trypanosomes and which is described in this report, is based on the rescueing of the rnai-mediated loss-of-function phenotype by expressing an rnai-resistant version of the target gene.

trypanosomes are protozoan parasites belonging to the kinetoplastida order. these unicellular flagellated organisms diverged very early in eukaryotic evolution, and exhibit a number of original features  <cit> . trypanosomes were amongst the first organisms where rnai was discovered  <cit> , and a number of strategies have been devised to either transiently or permanently induce gene-specific rnai-silencing in these cells  <cit> . examples of successful rnai in trypanosomes used flagellar genes as targets which yielded easily monitored phenotypes  <cit> . from a structural point of view, the most conserved morphological feature of eukaryotic flagella is the axoneme, which is made of nine doublets of outer microtubules plus  <dig> central microtubules . in trypanosomes, the flagellum not only has that axone-mal structure, but it also has a lattice-like structure called the paraflagellar rod  that is positioned along the axoneme. the two main components of the pfr are tbpfr <dig> and tbpfr <dig>  that share 60% primary sequence identity  <cit> . tbpfr <dig> silencing leads to flagellar paralysis and trypanosomes do not swim anymore  <cit> . during the cell cycle, the cell first replicates its mitochondrial dna  and starts to grow a new flagellum whilst maintaining the old flagellum in place. hence, a trypanosome which has two kinetoplasts and two nuclei will be close to completion of its cell cycle and will possess an old and a new flagellum  <cit> . this aspect is an interesting feature for rnai-based studies of flagellar morphogenesis, because bi-flagellated cells have an "internal control" flagellum , while the new one has a phenotype corresponding to the rnai-based gene knock-down. the presence of both the old and the new flagella in the same cell gives an indication of the time course of events when rnai is induced in trypanosomes, leading to the appearance of a visible phenotype in the new flagellum while the older one is unchanged because it is not affected by gene silencing.

we previously established the degree of identity between the gene sequences capable of leading to cross-rnai  <cit> . however, as mentioned earlier, each time a phenotype is observed in rnai experiments, it is necessary to ensure that it is indeed due to the specific silencing of the targeted gene. inspired by the procedure with which gene knock-out is usually performed , we devised a functional complementation strategy aimed at assessing that rnai indeed targets the intended gene. this strategy, elaborated using the tbpfr <dig> gene as a model system, involved the silencing of the tbpfr <dig> target via its utrs and the expression of a rnai-resistant copy of the targetted gene. the rnai-resistant gene was either a copy of tbpfr <dig> with different utrs or its trypanosoma cruzi orthologue: tcpfr <dig>  we found that inter-species complementation experiments were straight forward. this strategy opens a venue for functional gene dissection experiments where modified gene sequences can be tested for their ability to encode functional protein that can complement the rnai-based loss-of-function phenotype.

RESULTS
multiple rnai on trypanosomes
we wanted to establish if the co-transfection of two distinct dsrnas, targeting two different genes, could trigger their simultaneous silencing. the genes selected were tbpfr <dig> and fla1; tbpfr <dig> encodes one of the two major components of the paraflagellar rod and is necessary for flagellum motility  <cit> ; fla <dig> encodes a protein required for flagellum attachment to the cell body  <cit> . these dsrnas were transfected simultaneously in wild-type trypanosomes. as a control experiment, we used gfp dsrna.

cells were monitored for their acquired phenotype  <dig> h and  <dig> h after transfection . the extinction of tbpfr <dig> was followed by immunofluorescence microscopy using the l8c <dig> anti-tbpfr <dig> monoclonal antibody. fla <dig> gene silencing was analyzed by differential interference contrast microscopy, as it results in the visible detachement of the flagellum from the cell body .

the transfection of tbpfr <dig> dsrna yielded potent silencing, as more than  <dig> % of the cells showed no staining for l8c <dig>  <dig> h later. since old flagella pre-exist in cells which were affected by rnai at the beginning of cell replication, the real percentage of silenced cells is probably higher than  <dig> %, which is confirmed by the fact that it built up to more than  <dig> % at time point  <dig> h. the transfection of fla <dig> dsrna produced a phenotype in which the flagellum was detached from the cell body in more than  <dig> % of the cells. when both dsrnas were co-transfected, both phenotypes were indeed observed, with similar frequencies to experiments where only one dsrna was transfected. all the transfected cell populations did show a comparable growth rate . the trypanosomes shown in figure  <dig> had been transfected with both dsrnas and the cell on the right is starting cytokinesis. the old flagellum of that cell is detached, while the new flagellum is attached along the cell body. the new flagellum exhibits a dilation of its distal tip, probably corresponding to the accumulation of tbpfr <dig>  that is not assembled but still transported to the distal tip of the flagellum in the absence of tbpfr <dig>  <cit> . this observation demonstrates the usefulness of double-transfection experiments also for kinetics analysis. in our case,  <dig> h after dsrnas transient transfection, the phenotype due to the fla <dig> silencing is no longer visible in the new flagellum while that same flagellum still exhibits the phenotype due to the tbpfr <dig> silencing, clearly indicating different turn-over for tbpfr <dig> and fla <dig> proteins.

the rnai machinery could cope with two different dsrna populations, without – in our conditions – any visible saturation effect. these results show the feasibility of experiments involving the use of multiple dsrnas, thus allowing studies on complex processes in the cell physiology. however, such complex experiments can only be envisaged after ensuring that the phenotypes resulting from rnai are specifically due to silencing of the target gene. in order to address that specific problem, we elaborated a method that involves rnai experiments on trypanosomes that were engineered to possess an extra rnai-resistant copy of the targeted gene, leading to functional complementation.

gene silencing by dsrna targeting utrs
as a model for this study, we chose the tbpfr <dig> gene, which is present in four copies in the wt trypanosome genome , all transcribed as a single long polycistronic mrna. all these gene copies are separated by three identical intergenic utrs , while the first copy has a unique 5' utr and the last copy has a unique 3'utr. three types of dsrna populations were used in our experiments, and termed as follows. dsrna homologous to the gfp sequence was labelled "gfp dsrna"; dsrna homologous to coding sequence of the tbpfr <dig> gene was labelled "cds dsrna"; finally, the mixture of three dsrnas homologous to the 5' utr, igutr and 3'utr of the tbpfr <dig> gene was termed "utrs mix dsrnas" . these dsrnas were transfected into three cell lines: wt, tbpfr2tag and tbpfr2tag-Δhla . for each experiment, the presence or absence of tbpfr <dig> in the new flagellum of bi-nucleated/bi-flagellated cells was monitored by immunofluorescence  <dig> h after the transfection .

reports in  <cit>  showed that rnai silencing of a gene can be accomplished by targeting transcribed non-coding sequences. here, we wanted to make sure that this kind of experiment was still feasible with a more complex system such as the tbpfr <dig> multigene locus, where multiple and distinct utrs regulate the expression of four tbpfr <dig> isogenes. we first transfected wt trypanosomes with gfp dsrna as a negative control and did not detect any tbpfr <dig> silencing . second, wt trypanosomes were transfected with the cds dsrna:  <dig> % of cells showed typical tbpfr <dig> silencing with an anti-tbpfr <dig> immunofluorescence showing that the protein was missing from the new flagellum . finally, the wt trypanosomes were transfected with the utrs mix dsrnas, yielding the same phenotype as for the cds dsrna, although the silencing appeared less pronounced . overall, these results demonstrate that rnai could efficiently silence all of the tbpfr <dig> gene copies by targeting non-coding sequences present at the mrna level.

when wt trypanosomes were transfected with tbpfr <dig> dsrna complementary to only one utr, the cells did not display any specific phenotype . this observation is probably explained by the organization of the tbpfr <dig> locus: the polycistronic transcript is rapidly spliced into three different types of mrna, each encoding one of the four copies of tbpfr <dig>  <cit> . thus, even if one type of tbpfr <dig> rna is destroyed, the three remaining ones would likely provide enough rna to synthesize tbpfr <dig> levels compatible with normal pfr formation.

to demonstrate that the silencing observed upon transfection of wt trypanosomes with the utrs mix dsrnas was due to the actual targeting of tbpfr <dig>  we used two cell lines expressing a supplementary tagged tbpfr <dig> gene copy. the tbpfr2tag cell line expresses the tbpfr2-tag protein which correctly localizes to the flagellum.

the tbpfr2tag-Δhla cell line expresses tbpfr2-tag-Δhla, lacking the hla tripeptide, which prevents its localization to the flagellum. to determine both the cellular localization of the tagged tbpfr <dig> proteins  and the completeness of the pfr assembly, immunofluorescence experiments were carried out with the bb <dig> and rod- <dig> antibodies; the former recognizes the ty- <dig> epitope tag present on the two tagged tbpfr <dig> proteins  <cit> , while the latter is a marker for full pfr assembly  <cit> .

gfp dsrna was transfected as a negative control in each cell line. as expected, this did not yield any tbpfr <dig> silencing: tbpfr <dig> was decorated in both the old and new flagella by the anti-tbpfr <dig> antibody, and the pfr could be assembled fully, as evidenced by its staining with the rod- <dig> antibody . in tbpfr2tag cells, tbpfr2-tag was able to localize to the pfr, as evidenced by the pfr decoration with bb <dig> . in contrast, tbpfr2-tag-Δhla failed to do so in tbpfr2tag-Δhla cells, and the bb <dig> signal was detected in the cytoplasm, as expected .

we next compared tbpfr2tag trypanosomes after transfection with either cds dsrna or utrs mix dsrnas. tbpfr2tag cells transfected with cds dsrna had a flagellum not  decorated with the anti-tbpfr <dig> antibody, demonstrating that both the wt and the recombinant tbpfr <dig> gene copies were effciently silenced . that result was confirmed with anti-tag immunofluorescence that showed no staining of the flagellum, demonstrating that tbpfr2-tag was absent . this lack of both tbpfr <dig> and tbpfr2-tag led to an incomplete assembly of the pfr, which was therefore not decorated with the rod- <dig> antibody . in contrast, cells transfected with the utrs mix dsrnas exhibited a wt phenotype, with only  <dig> % of the cells displaying tbpfr <dig> silencing in the flagellum . in this case, the tagged protein was expressed, leading to complete assembly of the pfr  because the protein is functional and localized to the flagellum . this remarkable result indicates a complementation phenomenon that is explained by the fact that the tagged tbpfr <dig> gene was not silenced, as it was expressed from a coding sequence flanked by utrs from the expression vector: from the 5' utr of the procyclin gene and from the 3'utr of the aldolase gene .

to definitely demonstrate that the complementation described above is indeed due to the expression of functional tbpfr2-tag, we transfected the same dsrna into tbpfr2tag-Δhla trypanosomes expressing a modified tbpfr <dig> protein missing three amino acids . tbpfr2tag-Δhla does not access the flagellar compartment and thus cannot be functional  <cit> . transfecting either cds dsrna or utrs mix dsrnas produced cells in which the new flagellum was not  decorated by the anti-tbpfr <dig> antibody . tbpfr2-tag-Δhla was not decorated by the anti-tag antibody when cells were transfected with cds dsrna , indicating that both the wt and the tagged tbpfr <dig> copies were silenced, thus leading to an incomplete pfr edification . in contrast, transfection of utrs mix dsrnas did not prevent the expression of the recombinant tbpfr2-tag-Δhla protein, as it appeared stained by the anti-tag antibody . however, that non-functional protein could not participate in the construction of the pfr, as shown by the absence of rod- <dig> signal in the new flagellum, since it cannot access the flagellum .

rna-directed rna polymerase activity  has been implicated as one possible step in the formation of sirna in fungi  <cit> , plants  <cit> , and worms  <cit> . the fact that we could specifically silence wt tbpfr <dig> by targeting its utrs, without interfering with the tagged tbpfr <dig> genes, suggests that spreading of silencing beyond the initial targeted sequence does not occur in trypanosomes  <cit> .

functional complementation with orthologue genes
we next asked if an rnai-mediated loss of function could be complemented by the expression of a gene orthologue to the silenced one. the system used to answer that question involved the tbpfr2i cell line – that expresses tbpfr <dig> dsrna under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter  <cit>  – into which constitutive expression of trypanosoma cruzi tbpfr <dig> orthologue  was established using stable transfection procedures. tbpfr <dig> and tcpfr <dig> proteins share  <dig> % identity , but their gene sequences have diverged enough for us to envisage that the rnai-silencing of tbpfr <dig> would not affect significantly the introduced tcpfr <dig> gene . we thus created two new cell lines based on the previously described tbpfr2i cells  <cit>  . tbpfr <dig> expression and cell motility were analyzed.

our first experiment showed that the pcgfp cells constitutively expressed gfp, as detected by microscope observation of living cells . both the pcgfp and pctcpfr <dig> cell lines were induced to express tbpfr <dig> dsrna for  <dig> hours. immunofluorescence revealed that non-induced pcgfp cells exhibit a wt-like phenotype . when these cells were induced with tetracycline, expected tbpfr <dig> silencing occurred . non-induced pctcpfr <dig> cells displayed an intense anti-tbpfr <dig> antibody decoration with bright dots in the cytoplasm, indicative of tcpfr <dig> overexpression . when these same cells were tetracycline-induced, the flagellar staining was still perfectly visible, at a level comparable to the one previously observed in the non-induced pcgfp control cells . bright dots previously observed had disappeared, probably as a result of tbpfr <dig> silencing. the fact that the paraflagellar rod was still neatly decorated by the anti-tbpfr <dig> antibody demonstrated that the structural inter-species complementation had indeed taken place in these cells, with tcpfr <dig> being effectively located at the flagellum.

did these structurally-complemented cells show a functional complementation, i.e. a normal flagellum motility ? to address this question, we performed a sedimentation assay  <cit>  on non-induced and tetracycline-induced pcgfp and pctcpfr <dig> trypanosomes . non-induced pcgfp cells showed a little tendency to sediment due to the fact that expression of tbpfr <dig> dsrna in tbpfr2i cells is partially leaky, producing low amounts of tbpfr <dig> dsrna even in the absence of tetracycline . when expression of tbpfr <dig> dsrna was fully induced, motility stopped leading to increased sedimentation . in contrast, expression of tbpfr <dig> dsrna in pctcpfr <dig> cells did not reduce motility . that result definitely demonstrates that the ortholog protein tcpfr <dig> fully complemented the loss of function resulting from tbpfr <dig> silencing.

the complementation described above shows the robustness of our strategy, because tbpfr <dig> and tcpfr <dig> are highly similar  and are nonetheless correctly differenciated by the rnai machinery. however, our complementation strategy might be more diffcult to implement when the gene studied is too similar to the t. brucei counterpart. while this unfavorable case might happen with extremely evolutionarily-related organisms, studies have shown that the overall genetic sequence identity between trypanosoma brucei and trypanosoma cruzi, for example , is roughly  <dig> % .  <cit>  showed that this identity percentage is still compatible with an rnai-based complementation strategy. it goes without saying that when the organisms are evolutionarily-distant, gene sequences diverge more rapidly than the protein sequences, thus laying off a field where our strategy can be implemented with good confidence that complementation will occur.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we demonstrated that rnai-mediated silencing of a gene by targeting its utrs is useful in studies where the loss of function resulting from this silencing must be complemented with the expression of an rnai-resistant copy of the silenced gene, in order to demonstrate that the phenotype is indeed due to silencing of that gene, and not to inactivation of another one. the results obtained in this work are of particular interest when reverse-genetics studies cannot be easily achieved in organisms not amenable to rnai, like leishmania  <cit>  or trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> , or where genetics experiments are hardly set up, like mammals. when genes from these organisms are to be studied, a complementation experiment can be set up as a three-step procedure whereby: 1) the ortholog gene in trypanosoma brucei is rnai-silenced and the loss-of-function phenotype is established; 2) t. brucei cells are engineered to ensure constitutive heterologous expression of the gene of interest, still allowing rnai-mediated silencing of the t. brucei gene; 3) function of the investigated gene is assessed by checking if the loss-of-function phenotype observed in the first place gets complemented. additionally, one application of the strategy described herein is genetic functional dissection, which is of interest when protein domains are to be characterized with respect to their function .

complementation had previously been demonstrated following transformation of mammalian cells with egfp sirna and expression of a codon-modified, but functional, egfp version  <cit> . our strategies are increasing flexibility for complementation studies after rnai as unmodified genes can be used for rescue.
