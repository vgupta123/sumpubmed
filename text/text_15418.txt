BACKGROUND
at least one-third of enzymes characterized require metal ions to function. roles include electron transfer reactions, oxidations and a plethora of hydrolytic processes  <cit> . the majority of these enzymes require one or two metal ions for functionality but more complex multinuclear metal clusters also occur. amongst metalloenzymes binuclear hydrolases form a diverse family with biological functions including signal transduction and cell cycle progression, nucleotide homeostasis and bone metabolism  <cit> . members of this group of enzymes have evolved into targets for the development of chemotherapeutic agents.

binuclear metallohydrolases employ variants of the same basic mechanism to catalyze esterolysis of a large number of substrates, in some cases under inversion of stereochemistry, and in others without  <cit> . in the latter  a covalently modified enzyme intermediate is formed upon nucleophilic attack by a reactive amino acid residue. in the former a metal ion-bound water ligand is the proposed nucleophile, but its precise identity has been subject to debate and may vary in different enzymes  <cit> . the majority of binuclear metallohydrolases require the presence of two metal ions for reactivity, although their precise roles in catalysis and/or substrate or product binding have also remained conjectural  <cit> . note also that some members of this group of enzymes can operate with a single metal ion in the active site  centers  being most prevalent. heterovalent centers of the fe-m form have also been observed in a group of enzymes termed purple acid phosphatases   <cit> .

paps are active in the ph range between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and have been purified and characterized from a number of mammals and plants  <cit> , and pap-like genes have been identified in a limited number of microorganisms  <cit> . the animal enzymes are  <dig> kda monomers with redox-active fe-fe centers where only the heterovalent form is catalytically active  <cit> . proposed biological roles include iron transport, the generation of reactive oxygen species and bone resorption  <cit> . the latter has made the enzyme a target for the development of anti-osteoporotic drugs  <cit> . plant paps are  <dig> kda homodimers, containing fe-zn or fe-mn centers  <cit> , and a recombinant isoform from sweet potato has been shown to contain a di-iron center  <cit> . proposed biological roles for plant paps include phosphate metabolism and the generation of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . the characteristic purple color is due to a charge transfer transition between a tyrosine side-chain and the fe  <cit> .

the crystal structure of the free red kidney bean pap  and complexes with phosphate  and tungstate  are available  <cit> . in addition, structures of phosphate-bound sweet potato pap  <cit>  and several mammalian paps  have been determined  <cit> . despite low overall sequence homology between paps from animal and plant sources their active sites are remarkably conserved, with seven invariant metal ligands   <cit> .

in this study the structures of the rkbpap-sulfate and rkbpap-fluoride complexes were determined, providing insight into what we propose are two crucial steps in its catalytic mechanism,  the pre-catalytic stage, and  the chemical step. in combination with previously reported structural, kinetic and spectroscopic data a comprehensive model for the reaction mechanism involving eight steps is proposed.

RESULTS
the structure of the rkbpap-sulfate complex: a model for a pre-catalytic complex
in this study rkbpap was co-crystallized with sulfate, and diffraction data were collected at a resolution  which is better than that for any previously determined plant pap structure  <cit> . the fe and zn in this structure are separated by an average distance of  <dig>  Å , similar to that reported for the other rkbpap structures  <cit> . spherical electron density is observed  <dig>  Å from fe and  <dig>  Å from zn and therefore in a bridging position . this group is also within  <dig>  Å of the carbonyl oxygen of his <dig>  indicating the formation of a hydrogen bond . we therefore assign this density to that of a μ-hydroxo group, an interpretation in agreement with a previous study involving measurements of the magnetization of rkbpap under catalytically relevant conditions  <cit> . the fe is coordinated by a nitrogen atom from the side chain of his <dig>  oxygen atoms from the side chains of the chromophoric tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig> , and the bridging hydroxide . these five ligands coordinate the fe in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, where asp <dig>  the bridging hydroxide and tyr <dig> are coplanar with fe, and asp <dig> and his <dig> are in axial positions. zn is also pentacoordinate, ligated by the side-chain oxygen atoms of asp <dig> and asn <dig>  the side-chain nitrogen atoms of his <dig> and his <dig> and the μ-hydroxide. its geometry can be described as distorted square pyramidal . mechanistically, it is important to stress that the μ-hydroxide group is the only water molecule present in the active site, and given the location of this group the fitting of a sixth ligand to either metal is implausible .

the structure of the rkbpap-fluoride complex: insight into the chemical step of the hydrolytic reaction
rkbpap incubated with fluoride crystallized in a different space group and with different unit cell parameters compared to the sulfate complex . two dimers in the asymmetric unit are observed yielding four copies of the active site. in these structures the metal ions are on average  <dig>  Å apart, a distance significantly larger than that observed in any of the other rkbpap structures  <cit> . a small sphere of electron density is observed between the two metal ions , in a position similar, but not identical, to that of the μ-hydroxo in the rkbpap-sulfate complex. the center of the bridging electron density in the rkbpap-f structure is  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from fe and zn, respectively . in contrast, the bridging electron density in rkbpap-so <dig> is, respectively,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from fe and zn. thus, the bridging ligand is shifted  <dig>  Å closer to the zn and  <dig>  Å further away from the fe; its distance to the carbonyl oxygen of his <dig> is  <dig>  Å, compared to  <dig>  Å observed in the rkbpap-so <dig> structure . these differences indicate that fluoride rather than μ-hydroxide acts as the bridging ligand, as anticipated from kinetic and spectroscopic data collected for paps from pig, human and red kidney bean  <cit> , and other binuclear metallohydrolases  <cit> . additional electron densities in the second coordination sphere, close to the fluoride, are tentatively assigned to a sodium ion and a sulfate ion . the sodium ion may offset the charge of the metal bridging fluoride group, and possibly prevents cations  from binding to the second coordination sphere.

discussion
the study of the reaction mechanism of pap-catalyzed hydrolysis has received considerable attention over the past decade, with much of the focus directed towards the investigation of individual steps of the catalytic cycle. various stages of the mechanism have been subject to debate, none more so than the identity of the reaction-initiating nucleophile and the mode of substrate binding  <cit> . in this study, we provide insight into these two points of contention by combining the obtained structural data with previously reported spectroscopic, kinetic and crystallographic information, and a comprehensive eight-step model for the reaction cycle is proposed.

the pre-catalytic phase of the reaction cycle
the rate of the oxidation of reduced pig pap by 3- displays saturation behavior as the concentration of the oxidant is increased  <cit> . the model proposed to explain the observed saturation behavior invokes an initial rapid formation of an enzyme-3- complex, followed by a considerably slower catalytic step. this conclusion was further augmented by measurements of the rate of phosphate binding to the fe of pig pap using stopped-flow spectroscopy, leading to the suggestion that the substrate is also likely to associate initially with the enzyme, forming a catalytically non-competent complex   <cit> . it was speculated that interactions between conserved histidine residues in the active site may be responsible for the formation of this pre-catalytic complex , but the precise mode of binding for this complex remained obscure  <cit> . x-ray crystallography is an ideal method to visualize bonding interactions between a protein and a ligand. however, in order to study enzyme-substrate interactions suitable substrate analogues need to be available. a possible candidate mimic is phosphate. the crystal structure of rkbpap with bound phosphate was solved showing that the tetraoxo anion is coordinating to both metal ions   <cit> . however, since hydrolysis requires the coordination of the substrate to the metal center, followed by a nucleophilic attack by a metal-bound hydroxide  <cit> , the phosphate-bound rkbpap structure is likely to illustrate the product-bound state rather than providing a mimic for the pre-catalytic substrate-bound complex. the ph for crystallization was  <dig>   <cit> , hence phosphate is likely in its monoanionic form. however, substrates such as para-nitrophenolphosphate  may interact with the enzyme as a dianion  <cit> . thus, on the basis of similar charges, sulfate is a more appropriate mimic for the substrate . in contrast to the phosphate-bound rkbpap structure  <cit> , the sulfate ion in the active site does not coordinate directly to the metal ions. instead it is positioned in the second coordination sphere, stabilized via an extensive hydrogen bond network involving his <dig>  his <dig>  his <dig> and the zn ligand asn <dig> . hydrogen bonds can also be formed between the μ-hydroxide and two of the sulfate oxygens ; the crystal structure thus displays the averaged hydrogen bond pattern, evident as a "trifurcated" interaction). alternatively, it is possible that due to the presence of the sulfate group the pka of the bridging hydroxide is sufficiently elevated so that at ph  <dig>   it is protonated; in this case each of the protons may point towards one sulfate oxygen atom. at present the two possibilities cannot be distinguished. the intricacies of the extended hydrogen bond network are further illustrated by bi- and trifurcated interactions involving three of the four oxygen atoms of sulfate and several conserved first and second coordination sphere residues of rkbpap . at ph  <dig>   sulfate is expected to enter the active site in its dianionic  form. however, due to its extensive hydrogen bonding interactions the effective charge of sulfate is lowered, reducing its electrostatic attraction for the positively charged metal cluster. thus, the rkbpap-sulfate complex demonstrates, for the first time, how the pre-catalytic complex predicted from stopped-flow measurements  <cit>  may be formed and stabilized in the second coordination sphere of the enzyme. note, however, that in addition to mimicking the pre-catalytic stage the bound sulfate may also mimic the penultimate phase of catalysis, where the reaction product phosphate is still bound to the active site .

in the absence of crystallographic data for the complex between an actual substrate and rkbpap, in silico docking has been used to estimate the most likely binding mode of the leaving group based on the conformation of the sulfate group in the proposed pre-catalytic state . similarly, the binding mode of the leaving group in the rkbpap-phosphate complex  was also modeled , illustrating the required movement of the substrate in the active site during catalysis.

a sulfate-bound structure has also been reported for rat pap  <cit> , with a first coordination sphere geometry similar to that of rkbpap . however, in contrast to the latter in the rat enzyme so42- is bound in a monodentate manner to the metal ion at the m <dig> site  and is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with asn <dig>  and his <dig> . a similar mode of sulfate coordination has been observed in the ser/thr protein phosphatase from bacteriophage λ   <cit> . since kinetic and spectroscopic experiments with mammalian paps indicate that a monodentate coordination of the substrate to site m <dig> precedes hydrolysis  <cit> , the rat pap and λpp structures are thus likely to represent the step following the formation of the pre-catalytic complex . the different binding modes of sulfate in rat and rkbpap may be ascribed to:  his <dig>  in the rat enzyme being prevented from forming a hydrogen bond with sulfate due to the presence of a zn ion ;  his <dig> in rkbpap  being replaced by glu <dig> in rat pap, thus altering the chemistry at this site;  the μ-hydroxide in the rat pap structure being deprotonated under the conditions of crystallization ; and  the di-iron rat enzyme was likely to be crystallized in its inactive diferric form. thus, in the rat pap structure the combination of reduced hydrogen bonding interactions and increased positive charge in the metal cluster is likely to increase the electrostatic attraction between the metal center and sulfate, leading to direct metal ion coordination.

the chemical step of the catalytic cycle
apart from providing insight into a possible mode of interaction between substrate and enzyme, the rkbpap-sulfate structure also identifies the metal ion-bridging hydroxide as a candidate nucleophile . a similar conclusion was reached using a range of spectroscopic techniques, including electron-nuclear double resonance   <cit>  and x-ray absorption spectroscopy  <cit> .

fluoride has been shown to inhibit a number of metalloenzymes, and in paps is able to replace nucleophilic hydroxides coordinated to the metal ions  <cit> . specifically, for rkbpap fluoride is a competitive inhibitor with a ki ~ <dig> μm at ph  <dig>   <cit> . the above observation that the bridging hydroxide is the only nucleophile found in the active site of the rkbpap-so <dig> crystal structure  leads to the suggestion that fluoride is able to displace this group, thus forming a μ-fluoro binuclear center. this interpretation is supported by the crystal structure of the rkbpap-fluoride complex . importantly, this structure lends credence to an activation mechanism for the hydrolysis-initiating nucleophile. previous studies proposed a terminal m1-bound hydroxide as the most likely candidate as the nucleophile, and it was suggested that the nucleophilicity of a bridging hydroxide would be too low to assure efficient reactivity  <cit> . however, the rkbpap-so <dig> structure  and endor measurements of pig pap  <cit>  indicate that there is no terminal water ligand at the m <dig> site in the resting and pre-catalytic state . the latter study  <cit>  suggested that the reduced nucleophilicity of the bridging hydroxide is compensated by an increased electrophilicity of the substrate when comparing the possibilities of  a terminally coordinated nucleophile and terminally coordinated substrate, with  a bridging nucleophile and bridging substrate. furthermore, binding of the substrate decreases the coupling interaction between the two metal centers, indicating a lengthening of the metal-metal distance and a concomitant additional increase of the nucleophilicity of the bridge by effectively shifting it towards the divalent cation   <cit> . this substrate-induced shift of the bridging ligand is also illustrated for fluoride-bound pig pap by a combination of inhibition kinetics, resonance raman, electron paramagnetic resonance and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopies, which have demonstrated that in the ternary enzyme-fluoride-substrate complex the fluoride ion is located closer to the divalent metal ion  <cit> . furthermore, studies involving absorption spectroscopy and  circular dichroism have also indicated that the binding of substrate analogues to pig pap decreases the exchange coupling with an accompanying red-shift of the charge transfer transition  <cit> . these observations were interpreted in terms of a weakening of the fe-μ-oh bond. thus, both μ-fluoride and μ-hydroxide in pap are affected in a similar manner when substrate binds to the enzyme. here, the comparison between the sulfate- and fluoride-bound rkbpap structures corroborates this mechanism for the activation of the bridging nucleophile. the metal-metal distance in rkbpap-f is elongated by ~ <dig>  Å and the metal ion-bridging ligand is shifted towards m <dig> and away from m <dig> . in summary, the combined structural, spectroscopic and kinetic data support the proposal that substrate binding triggers the shift of the μ-hydroxide into a "quasi-terminal" position, thus increasing its nucleophilicity.

a comprehensive model for the catalytic mechanism
based on all of the available data for paps the following model of a comprehensive mechanism of catalysis emerges . monitoring the oxidation  of fe-fe pig pap by 3- has provided evidence for the formation of a pre-catalytic complex in the initial phase of the reaction, where the phosphate group of the substrate does not directly coordinate to the metal ions  <cit> . the structure of rkbpap-so <dig> demonstrates a plausible model for the pre-catalytic complex where the substrate mimic, sulfate, is bound in the second coordination sphere, an arrangement stabilized via an extensive hydrogen bonding network . the bridging μ-hydroxide appears to play an essential role in the initial binding and orientation of the substrate . in this pre-catalytic state both metal ion sites are five-coordinate with distorted trigonal-bipyramidal geometry. the only solvent molecule in the active site is the μ-hydroxide. since an endor study provided evidence for the presence of an additional water ligand bound terminally to the metal ion in the m <dig> site in resting pig pap   <cit> , the formation of the pre-catalytic complex may thus lead to the expulsion of this labile terminal water ligand .

the formation of the pre-catalytic complex with the concomitant expulsion of the m <dig> site bound terminal water ligand generates a vacant coordination position for an oxygen atom of the phosphate group , as exemplified in sulfate-bound structures of rat pap and λpp   <cit> . coordination of the substrate to the m <dig> site and subsequent structural rearrangements in the m <dig> site permit the formation of a μ- <dig>  substrate complex . in support of this hypothesis epr measurements have indicated that, in fluoride-inhibited pig pap, substrates and the reaction product phosphate bind in a similar metal ion-bridging μ- <dig>  mode to the binuclear center  <cit> . the resulting μ- <dig>  phosphate complex, visualized in the structure of oxidized  pig pap  <cit> , places the phosphorus atom in an ideal position for a nucleophilic attack by the μ-hydroxide moiety .

the proposed structural rearrangements in the m <dig> site are likely to be mediated via the hydrogen bond network in the second coordination sphere. a related observation has been made in the mononuclear soybean lipoxygenase- <dig> where the degree of coordination flexibility mediated via a hydrogen bond network in the second coordination sphere directly correlates with the reactivity of this enzyme  <cit> . superposition of the rkbpap structures with bound sulfate, fluoride and phosphate demonstrates that the geometry of the protein ligands in the m <dig> site and the position of the m <dig> metal ion  are, within experimental error, fixed. however, for the m <dig> site in the fluoride bound structure the metal ion is shifted by up to  <dig>  Å when compared to rkbpap-so <dig> and rkbpap-po <dig> which then results in compensatory rotations of the side chains of tyr <dig> and his <dig> 

nucleophilic attack by the μ-hydroxide and esterolysis of the substrate  leaves the phosphate bound to the active site in a tripodal geometry . this mode of coordination has been observed in the crystal structures of sweet potato pap and di-ni urease, both with bound phosphate, and di-mn λpp, with bound sulfate  <cit> . hydrogen bond interactions with the carbonyl oxygen of the metal ion ligand his <dig> may stabilize this tripodal arrangement, at least at low ph  <cit> . in figure  <dig> the movement required for the phosphate group of the substrate from initial binding in the pre-catalytic complex to the tripodal arrangement following hydrolysis is illustrated.

at this point it is important to point out that evidence has recently emerged that suggests that the chemical step may be affected by both the substrates used in the reaction and the metal ion composition of the active site  <cit> . specifically, it could be shown that both pig and rkbpap hydrolyze both ester bonds in the diester substrate methyl-pnpp in a processive manner  <cit> . this observation is interpreted in terms of an initial monodentate coordination of the substrate to the m2-site, followed by a nucleophilic attack by a terminal fe-bound hydroxide. this process is also observed in reactions catalyzed by a fezn biomimetic of paps, where only the terminal hydroxide is sufficiently nucleophilic to induce hydrolysis  <cit> . subsequently, but only in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the bridging hydroxide initiates the cleavage of the second ester bond of the substrate in a manner similar to that described in the preceding paragraph  <cit> . since no terminal fe-bound hydroxide appears to be present in the resting state of paps  the interaction between the diester substrate and the enzyme active site may lead to the introduction of an additional water ligand.

the regeneration of the resting form of the enzyme, which requires the removal of the phosphate from the active site, is currently not well understood. a plausible sequence involves the rearrangement of the bound phosphate group from tripodal  to μ- <dig>  coordination  via a rotation around the axis formed by the two oxygen atoms of phosphate that are terminally coordinated to the metal ions in sites m <dig> and m <dig>  although we are not aware of a precedent where the simultaneous loss of two lewis interactions is invoked as part of a catalytic mechanism, the resulting μ- <dig> -po <dig> complex has been observed in the structure of rkbpap, where a μ-hydroxide bridge was also modelled into the active site although this ligand could not be identified in the  <dig>  Å electron density map  <cit> . it is speculated that the loss of strain is a major contributing force to drive the conversion from a tripodal to a μ- <dig>  coordination mode. no experimental data for the subsequent steps in regeneration are yet available but a possible mechanism is depicted in figures 6f–6h. the exchange of the m2-coordinated phosphate oxygen atom by water leads to a monodentate, m1-bound phosphate. due to geometric constraints the m2-bound water ligand is likely to form a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group , thus facilitating its deprotonation. the m2-hydroxide then interacts with the metal ion in the m <dig> site, thus regenerating the μ-hydroxide bridge, weakening the m1-phosphate bond, and providing a vacant coordination position for another water molecule in the m <dig> site . the subsequent release of the phosphate group enables the m <dig> site to regain resting state, trigonal-bipyramidal geometry . although the precise details of the phosphate release mechanism remain unknown it is conceivable that the anion is shuttled away from the active site via the second coordination sphere, where it may interact through hydrogen bonds with histidine residues in a manner analogous to that of the substrate in the pre-catalytic complex . it appears thus likely that the reversible interactions between the phosphate group and the second coordination sphere trigger conformational changes that take place during a catalytic turnover in the active site of paps.

CONCLUSIONS
by a combination of crystallographic, kinetic and spectroscopic data an eight-step model for the reaction mechanism of rkbpap-catalyzed hydrolysis has been developed. modifications of this basic mechanism are anticipated depending on the substrates used. the mechanistic model developed here may also be relevant for several other binuclear enzymes from the binuclear metallohydrolase family. the observed binding mode for sulfate provides a new lead in the design of metallohydrolase-selective therapeutics.
