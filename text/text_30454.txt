BACKGROUND
most birds studied so far have highly conserved karyotypes, similar to that of the chicken , consisting of several pairs of macrochromosomes and a mass of microchromosomes, with diploid chromosome number  varying mainly from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the diurnal birds of prey have a unique karyotype organization that differs widely from the usually conserved genomic structure found in other bird lineages  <cit> . in particular, accipitridae species display the most atypical karyotypes known in aves  <cit> . the more than fifty accipitrid species studied so far  share the following karyotypic characteristics: 1) most species have diploid chromosome numbers varying from  <dig> to 68; 2) they lack large macrochromosomes; and 3) they have many medium-to small-sized bi-armed chromosomes and usually three to six pairs of microchromosomes  <cit> . only one pair of microchromosomes was found in the black-winged kite   <cit> . previous karyotypic comparisons have suggested that such atypical karyotypes of accipitrids could have evolved from a typical bird karyotype by a series of fissions of macrochromosomes and translocations of some macrochromosome segments onto the microchromosomes and small acrocentrics  <cit> . however, the exact nature of chromosome structural rearrangements that took place in the karyotype evolution of the accipitrid lineage remains largely unclear.

cross-species chromosome painting in birds, mostly with painting probes derived from flow-sorted gga macrochromosomes, has allowed the establishment of reliable chromosome homologies between gga and more than fifty avian species belonging to twelve orders . to date, comparative chromosome painting with gga chromosome-specific probes has been applied to nine species in accipitridae: the harpy eagle   <cit> , three old world vultures   <cit> , the white hawk   <cit> , the japanese mountain hawk-eagle   <cit> , and three species of buteoninae   <cit> . gga 1– <dig> probes each detected two or more homologous chromosomes or chromosome segments in the karyotypes of accipitrid species studied so far, demonstrating that synteny disruption exists in the gga 1– <dig> homologues. gga 6– <dig> probes each revealed one pair of homologous chromosomes or chromosome segments, indicating that the gga 6– <dig> homologues are conserved in accipitridae. besides gga 1– <dig> probes, several sets of probes derived from gga microchromosome pools were also used in a few avian chromosome painting studies . a paint pool for nineteen gga microchromosomes detected homology with a lesser number of chromosomal segments and smaller chromosomes in two accipitrid species , suggesting that the decrease in chromosome number in accipitridae was due to fusions between microchromosomes and fusions of microchromosomes with larger chromosomes  <cit> . however, the gga microchromosomes homologues involved in the fusions remain unidentified due to the use of a paint pool containing multiple undefined gga microchromosomes. to better characterize the microchromosomes involved in rearrangements as well as the evolutionary breakpoints along gga macrochromosomes, chromosome-specific probes from more bird species, in particular those with atypical karyotypes, are required.

most recently, two complete sets of painting probes have been generated from two neoavian species: the stone curlew   <cit>  and the white hawk   <cit> . boe has one of the lowest diploid numbers reported so far in birds. using the gga and boe chromosome painting probes, the first reciprocal chromosome painting between avian species was performed, and a comparative chromosome map between boe and gga has been established  <cit> . the whole set of boe painting probes was subsequently used to delineate chromosome homology between boe and representatives of five avian orders  <cit> . in addition, pal probes were used to detect chromosomal homologies between gga 1– <dig> and that of pal  <cit> , between pal and three macrochromosomes of a new world vulture, the turkey vulture   <cit> , three buteoninae species   <cit>  and two turdidae songbirds   <cit> . up to now, all cross-species chromosome painting studies in birds have involved either two species with typical avian karyotypes, or one species with a typical and the other with an atypical karyotype. no genome-wide comparative chromosome painting between two bird species with atypical karyotypes has ever been performed.

in the past, the diurnal birds of prey constituted the order falconiformes and were classified into five families   <cit> . however, the status of falconiformes as a natural  group was long under debate due to marked heterogeneity in karyological, morphological and mitochondrial  gene order found in different families of falconiformes . the most recent molecular phylogeny studies retrieved strong support for a clade containing the secretary bird , the osprey  and the traditional accipitrids . consequently, falconiformes now only includes the family falconidae, while the other diurnal birds of prey constitute a new order, accipitriformes. here, we adopted this new taxonomic classification for the diurnal birds of prey. in accipitriformes, there are some important unresolved issues concerning the rank of the osprey and the status of the old world vultures as well as the buteoninae as monophyletic or polyphyletic groups. the osprey was often recognized as a family-level taxa ; however, in some studies, together with the secretary bird, the osprey was assigned the rank of subfamily within accipitridae . recent molecular studies suggested that the old world vultures and the buteoninae were polyphyletic  <cit> . up to now, no sagittariidae species  has ever been studied using chromosome painting. besides accipitridae, three species from other families of accipitriformes and three species from falconiformes have been studied by this technique  <cit> . the availability of chromosome painting data from different diurnal birds of prey families offers us the opportunity to decipher the genomic rearrangements within the diurnal birds of prey and to search for cytogenetic evidence for the phylogenetic relationships within the accipitriformes.

in this context, we here report the generation of 1) a complete set of painting probes that cover the whole genome of the griffon vulture , an old world vulture, through bivariate flow sorting and dop-pcr amplification; and 2) comparative chromosome maps based on reciprocal chromosome painting between boe and gfu, two species belonging to different orders with atypical karyotypes . moreover, the whole set of boe probes was hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of two species in accipitridae, himalayan griffon  and common buzzard  to detect karyotypic differences between these species. a cladistic analysis using chromosomal rearrangements as well as the mapping of zoo-fish-inferred chromosomal differences on a concensus molecular phylogeny were performed, providing further insight into the origin and evolution of the extensively rearranged accipitriformes genome.

RESULTS
characterization of the g. fulvus flow karyotype
as reported previously  <cit> , gfu has a 2n =  <dig> karyotype, including fifteen meta-or sub-metacentric chromosomes, thirteen acrocentric chromosomes, four pairs of dot-like microchromosomes, together with a large submetacentric z and a medium-sized submetacentric w. the thirty-three pairs of gfu chromosomes were resolved into twenty-three flow peaks . hybridizing paints prepared from individual peaks onto gfu metaphases established the identity of the chromosomes contained in each peak. reciprocal chromosome painting between gfu and boe was also performed to resolve any ambiguity in the chromosomal assignment of each flow peak and, in particular, of the peaks that contained multiple chromosomes . the majority of flow peaks each contained only one type of gfu chromosome, with the exception of seven peaks, of which four peaks each contained two gfu chromosomes , one peak contained three gfu chromosomes  and the remaining two peaks each contained four gfu chromosomes . moreover, the two homologues of chromosome  <dig> were each sorted into a different flow peak. thus, a set of chromosome painting probes that cover the entire genome of gfu was generated.fig.  <dig> bivariate flow karyotype of g. fulvus  with chromosome assignments



reciprocal chromosome painting between g. fulvus and b. oedicnemus
together with boe  <cit>  and pal  <cit> , the set of gfu painting probes represents the third set of paints that have been generated from neoaves. reciprocal chromosome painting between gfu and boe established chromosome homologies between these species and defined chromosomes contained in gfu flow peaks. fish examples are shown in fig.  <dig>  and results of reciprocal chromosome painting between boe and gfu are summarized onto dapi–banded karyotypes of gfu  and boe , respectively.fig.  <dig> reciprocal chromosome painting between boe and gfu. a boe  <dig> probe hybridized to seven pairs of gfu chromosomes. b probes from gfu  <dig> ,  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  painted boe  <dig>  c boe  <dig> probe hybridized to three pairs of gfu chromosomes. d probes from gfu  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  labeled boe  <dig>  e boe  <dig> probe hybridized to four pairs of gfu chromosomes. f probes from gfu  <dig> ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  probes painted boe  <dig>  g gfu  <dig> probe labeled gfu <dig>  h gfu  <dig> probe hybridized to boe  <dig> and  <dig>  note that cross-hybridization signals were also detected on boe z and w. due to the fact that one of the used gfu probes in ,  and  contained two or more gfu chromosomes or that one used gfu probe gave signals on two or more boe chromosomes, besides boe 1– <dig>  other boe chromosomes also were painted in ,  and

gfu autosomal probes revealed forty-one segments of conserved synteny in the boe genome . twenty-four gfu chromosomes  each corresponded to one boe chromosome or chromosome segment; eight gfu chromosomes  each corresponded to two boe chromosomes or chromosome segments. in agreement with the finding that boe 1– <dig>  probes gave signals on multiple gfu chromosomes, boe 1– <dig>  were each painted by three or more gfu probes . the gfu  <dig> probe  gave two discrete signals on boe  <dig> and one signal on boe  <dig> . cross-hybridization signals were also found on boe z and w chromosomes . finally, the pooled probe from the four smallest gfu microchromosomes  painted the smallest four pairs of boe microchromosomes .

hybridizing b. oedicnemus probes onto metaphases of g. himalayensis and b. buteo
like other gyps species, g. himalayensis  has a 2n =  <dig> karyotype, which is similar to that of gfu. as expected, the patterns produced by hybridizing each boe probe to gfu and ghi chromosomes were identical . examples of boe probes hybridizing to chromosomes of ghi are shown in fig. 4c and h. accordingly, paints from boe autosomes detected forty homologous segments in ghi .fig.  <dig>

the male b. buteo  shows a 2n =  <dig> karyotype, comprising fifteen pairs of meta-or sub-metacentric chromosomes, fourteen pairs of acrocentric chromosomes, four pairs of microchromosomes and one pair of large submetacentric z chromosomes , as previously reported  <cit> . painting probes from boe were hybridized to metaphase spreads of bbu. fish examples are shown in fig. 4d, e and g. results are summarized using a dapi-banded karyotype of bbu . hybridization patterns produced by each boe probe were very similar in gfu, ghi and bbu. only two boe probes gave different numbers of signals in bbu, gfu and ghi. boe  <dig>  probe painted eight pairs of bbu chromosomes , but only seven pairs of chromosomes in gfu and ghi ; boe  <dig>  probe hybridized onto three pairs of bbu chromosomes  but two pairs of chromosomes in gfu and ghi . in total, probes from boe autosomes revealed forty-two homologous segments in the bbu genome.

to facilitate comparison of homologous chromosomal segments across bird species, the homologous gga chromosome segments as inferred from the gga–boe comparative chromosomal map  <cit>  were also indicated to the left of gfu, boe, ghi and bbu chromosomes .

chromosomal phylogeny of the diurnal birds of prey
in total,  <dig> chromosomal characters were constructed from available inter-species chromosome painting data including  <dig> species of accipitriformes and  <dig> species of falconiformes . the exhaustive search allowed us to retrieve  <dig> equally most parsimonious trees . these  <dig> trees were largely congruent in showing three main clades: one represented the new world vultures; one grouped all falconid representatives, while the other gathered all accipitrid species. furthermore, the grouping of neotropical buteoninae  was systematically retrieved while the palearctic buteonine species bbu was consistently found closer to an assemblage made of accipitrid  as well as pandionid  species. the main topologic instability originated from the uncertainty in the branching of gba and hha . the  <dig> % majority-rule tree is represented in fig.  <dig>  a posteriori polarization of character changes along this tree using the outgroup comparison criterion showed that more than  <dig> chromosomal rearrangements occurred during the karyotypic evolution of the diurnal birds of prey studied here . among them,  <dig> could be unambiguously characterized:  <dig> corresponded to syntenic associations while  <dig> were syntenic disruptions . three characters  could represent convergent or reversal events. three other characters were hardly interpretable due to the topologic instability of gba and/or hha .table  <dig> data matrix used in the paup analysis

note: chromosomal rearrangement characters used in this table were from previous published data and current study . in the column of “character ”, the individual numbers or the numbers before alphabets represent the numbers of homologous gga chromosomes or chromosomal segments. “p”: the short arm of a given chromosome; “q”: the long arm of a given chromosome; “seg”: a segment on a given chromosome; “prx”: the part which is near to the centromere of a given chromosome or its arm; “med”: the part which is in the medial of a given chromosome or its arm; “dis”: the part which is distal to the centromere of a given chromosome or its arm; “mic”: the homologous gga microchromosome. the chromosomal rearrangements in the diurnal birds of prey involved many homologous gga microchromosomes. however, it is impossible to identify each homologous gga microchromosomes due to the lack of single gga microchromosome-specific probes. the numbers after “mic” are arbitrary numbers assigned for gga microchromosomes involved in different species. gga  <dig> is homologous to 4– <dig> pairs of chromosomes in different accipitriformes species. whereby the homologues of gga  <dig> segments involved in chromosome arrangements could not be identified unambiguously based chromosome banding and painting data, different symbols were used to represent the homologues of gga  <dig> segments in different species, such as  <dig> seg-n <dig> and 1seg-n <dig> in hha, 1seg-na, 1seg-nb and 1seg-nc in gba, and 1seg-na to 1seg-ne in pha

as an alternative approach to the above-mentioned parsimony-based cladistic analysis. these chromosomal characters were also mapped onto a consensual molecular tree generated by combining recent phylogenetic data in the literature  <cit>  . this treatment allowed the visualization of potential cytogenetic signature rearrangement that could characterize the major lineages observed on the molecular-based consensus phylogeny. in congruence with the cladistic analysis, such an approach shows that different diurnal birds of prey taxa underwent different chromosomal changes, although many chromosomal characters were inferred to appear independently in different lineages. this is an indication of either true homoplasy or potential uncertainty in the branching as suggested by the molecular topology.

discussion
the generation of probes from gfu, a species of the old world vultures, the application of both boe and gfu probes to comparative painting in more accipitrid representatives as well as a cladistics analysis permitting proper a posteriori polarization of evolutionary events have enabled us to define further the types and number of chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred during the karyotypic diversification of falconiformes and accipitriforms, with special emphasis on falconidae, accipitridae and pandionidae.

our painting results with boe probes have demonstrated that the two 2n =  <dig> old world vultures  have identical karyotypes , and that at least twelve syntenic disruptions and nine segmental associations differentiate the karyotype of boe from those of gfu and ghi. in a previous study, the hybridization patterns produced by gga 1– <dig> probes were shown to be identical also between gfu and gru   <cit> . these results indicated that extant gyps vultures have undergone no interchromosomal rearrangements during their divergence.

the hybridization patterns of boe probes in bbu  were very similar to those observed in gfu and ghi. fourteen syntenic disruptions and ten syntenic associations were revealed in the karyotype of bbu by boe probes. among these rearrangements, eleven disruptions  and eight associations  detected in gfu and ghi by boe probes were also shared with bbu. the karyotype differences between bbu  and the 2n =  <dig> old world vultures  could have resulted from two further syntenic disruptions of homologous segments of boe  <dig> and  <dig>  and one further syntenic association . since multiple chromosomes in bbu, gfu and ghi show homologies with boe  <dig> , it is difficult to define which homologous segment of boe  <dig> has undergone further fission in bbu based only on painting results from boe probes. further hybridization with gfu probes onto chromosomes of gfu, boe and bbu allowed us to address this uncertainty . the results indicate that the gfu  <dig>  homologous segment  has undergone a syntenic disruption in bbu . therefore, further syntenic disruptions of an ancestral macrochromosome segment  and a microchromosome  could have occurred during chromosome evolution in bbu. moreover, the complete conservation of boe 17– <dig> and gfu 29– <dig> in multiple species studied here and in the rock pigeon  as revealed by boe 17– <dig> probes  <cit>  suggests that these four pairs of dot-shaped microchromosomes have a much more ancient origin, most likely already being present in the ancestral bird karyotype.fig.  <dig> examples of cross-species chromosome painting with gfu probes. a hybridization of gfu  <dig> probe to gfu chromosomes. b hybridization of gfu  <dig> probe to boe 1pter. c hybridization of gfu  <dig> probe to bbu chromosomes



previous comparative cytogenetic analyses indicated that the variation in karyotypes in the diurnal birds of prey was much wider than that in other avian groups, each family having its distinct karyotype features  <cit> . to date, including the current study, chromosome painting has been performed in fourteen species belonging to three families of the accipitriformes and three species of falconiformes. only the monotypic family sagittaridae, represented by the secretary bird , has not been studied yet by chromosome painting. table  <dig> lists the correspondence between gga 1– <dig> and their counterparts in boe and seventeen species belonging to accipitriformes and falconiformes. these homology data, together with chromosome painting data on other birds, allowed us to deduce the possible process of karyotype evolution in accipitriformes through a proper cladistics analysis and mapping the chromosomal changes onto a consensus molecular tree.table  <dig> homologies between gga 1– <dig> and chromosomes of boe and seventeen species in accipitriformes and falconiformes revealed by chromosome painting



















in our cladistics analysis, two species  showed clear unstable locations in the most parsimonious trees that we retrieved here . this was probably due to insufficient resolution of some chromosomal changes and further reciprocal painting involving hha and gba will be needed to clarify the relationships of these two species with accipitridae and pandionidae. yet, despite hha and gba instability, our chromosome-based cladistic analysis retrieved several cytogenetic signatures that support some groupings within accipitriformes , with some of them having already been suggested. for instance, seven characters  united the pha + all accipitrid species  in one monophyletic assemblage; three characters  supported the pha + gfu  + nni + bbu clade; one synapomorphy  linked neotropical buteoninae species. the three species of falconiformes shared eight common characters , thus leading to karyotypes that differ greatly from those found in accipitriformes. two characters  seemed to link accipitriformes and falconiformes. however, the syntenic disruptions of 2p/2q and 5a/5b  were also found in some galliformes   <cit>  and strigiformes species  <cit> . so further analysis is needed to clarify if these characters will be convergent events or not. in addition, species in cathartidae  have typical avian karyotypes, and showed a high degree of conservation in chromosomal synteny with gga, thus differing from other species in accipitriformes and species in falconiformes, including those studied here.

besides our cladistic analysis, we also mapped the chromosomal rearrangements onto a consensus molecular tree . although the  <dig> % majority-rule tree of the diurnal birds of prey that we retrieved using chromosomal rearrangements  had some differences from the molecular phylogeny , both analyses  revealed a number of potential cytogenetic signatures for some clades investigated here. for instance, both analyses suggested that  falconids  had unique chromosomal rearrangements, differing from that of accipitriformes species;  pha  shared several common chromosomal rearrangements with other accipitridae species;  the old world vulture of 2n =  <dig>  had some distinct chromosomal characters differing from those 2n =  <dig> old world vultures, although the number of common characters was different in both analyses. some common chromosomal rearrangements, such as characters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  were mapped onto different clades, i.e. pha, some of old world vultures , nni and bbu. however, in our cladistic analysis, characters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> supported these species in one assemblage. for the placement of pandionidae , most molecular phylogenetic studies indicate that sagittariidae, pandionidae and accipitridae form a clade, with pandionidae being more closely related to accipitridae  <cit> , but one molecular phylogenetic study supported that the osprey lies within the accipitridae  <cit> . the results of our current cladistic analysis provided three cytogenetic signatures  that support the latter study, and also suggest that pha  may well be a member of accipitridae. in addition, our cladistic results confidently indicated that bbu, a supposed buteoninae species from palearctic, was much closer to other accipitrids  than to the neotropical buteoninae species.

to date, the reason and mechanism explaining why extensive chromosomal fissions and fusions have occurred only in accipitriformes and falconiformes species remains unclear. the possible origin of the peculiar characteristics of the accipitriformes karyotypes was briefly discussed by de boer  <cit> . a translocation model of the evolution of karyotype organization in accipitridae was also proposed based on computer simulations  <cit> . however, this model had to be verified by analysis of dna sequences and localization of transposable elements in accipitridae species  <cit> . further high-resolution mapping and sequence analysis of evolutionary synteny breakpoints are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie such extensive chromosomal rearrangements. in addition, the species in sagittariidae and the two accipitrid species with diploid number differing from that of the majority of accipitrids , northern goshawk  with 2n =  <dig> and crested eagle  with 2n =  <dig>  remain to be studied by comparative chromosome painting. the chromosome painting data in these species may be the key to understand the whole karyotype evolution in accipitriformes.

CONCLUSIONS
we here established comparative chromosome maps between boe and the 2n =  <dig> old world vultures  and the 2n =  <dig> bbu by cross-species chromosome painting using two sets of probes from avian species with atypical karyotypes . our results indicated that at least eleven syntenic disruptions and eight segmental associations were shared by the 2n =  <dig> old world vultures and the 2n =  <dig> bbu, thus indicating that bbu could be more closely-related to other accipitrids than to the neotropical buteoninae species . our investigations within the diurnal birds of prey have revealed some cytogenetic signatures for different lineages and provided support for the groupings of  falconiformes, and  accipitridae + pandionidae. finally, our chromosome-based cladistic analysis reinforced the proposition that the osprey  might be a member of accipitridae.
