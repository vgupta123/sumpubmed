BACKGROUND
escherichia coli  o <dig> is a pathogen of serious public health concern. ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep and goats are asymptomatic carriers of this organism and represent a significant source from where verocytotoxigenic e. coli  can enter the environment and also the food chain. vtec can colonise and potentially re-colonise animals for long periods  <cit> . in cattle the organism has been recognised to colonise the final few centimeters of the gut at the terminal rectum adjacent to the anal canal, from where it coats the faeces as the animal defecates  <cit> . although colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract appears to be transient  <cit> , persistent shedders of high quantities of these organisms can exist within groups of cattle  <cit> . this can lead to a rapid transmission of e. coli o <dig> amongst housed cattle, with contamination of the drinking water, pen barriers and hides possibly occurring within twenty-four hours  <cit> .

the bacterium survives in the farm environment. on-farm sources from which these e. coli o <dig> organisms have been isolated include water, water troughs, stored animal faeces and feed. studies have shown that e. coli o157:h <dig> can survive in animal faeces for up to  <dig> days and  <dig> days in water  <cit> . water troughs on farms have been frequently found to contain vtec, which could in turn act as a source from which the bacterium can spread to large numbers of animals over a short period of time  <cit> . farmyard gates and stiles also pose a direct risk as e. coli o <dig> have the potential to persist for long periods on these surfaces  <cit> . contamination of the environment by e. coli o <dig> is also a serious threat to those working on farms  and also those visiting farms especially young children  <cit> .

recently, multi-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis  has become an established technique to subtype e. coli o <dig>  <cit> . mlva is a pcr-based subtyping method that can be used to discriminate amongst different strains of a bacterium based on differences in the number of tandem repeats . the number of trs at a specific locus in the genome of a microorganism can vary as a consequence of dna polymerase enzyme slippage during replication. detection of these tr differences can be achieved by pcr incorporating primer pairs designed to anneal to the flanking regions of each tr followed by amplification and conventional agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> .

in this paper we describe the application of mlva sub-typing to uncover the dynamics of strain dissemination in a cattle feedlot.

RESULTS
locus-specific pcr primer sets previously characterised by noller et al.,   <cit>  were used to amplify each of seven tr regions using single primer-paired reactions for all fifty-four isolates analysed. amplified products were produced for the majority of the e. coli o <dig> strains with the following exceptions; isolates cfse- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  did not produce any amplicon for the tr- <dig> locus, similarly cfse- <dig> for tr- <dig>  cfse- <dig> for tr- <dig>  cfse- <dig> for tr- <dig> and cfse- <dig> for the tr <dig>  amplicon. the numbers of repeats identified in this collection, ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> across the seven loci analysed and these are presented in table  <dig>  diversity indices were calculated for all trs using simpson's index with values ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> % . the highest level of diversity  was among the repeats identified at tr- <dig>

based on the mlva types defined above, a dendrogram was created to cluster the isolates . analysis of these repeats identified twelve mlva profiles . a minimum spanning tree  was also constructed which was rooted to the isolate with the highest number of related isolates to it . all other isolates were derived from this root demonstrating the overall genetic clustering that existed amongst these strains. a number of distinct clusters were noted in the mst and as expected the main clustering occurred within pens, in cattle faecal isolates and also environmental samples from respective pens.

a schematic representation of the spatial and chronological distribution of e. coli o <dig> clusters in this feedlot is shown in figure  <dig>  the pen floor layout highlights the corresponding mlva types of each strain over the four-month study period. multiple e. coli o <dig> strains were detected in each pen as indicated by the mlva types . strains of e. coli o <dig> with mlva type  <dig> were cultured from cattle faecal samples in pen  <dig> in november. by december, strains with this particular type were cultured from cattle faecal samples in pen  <dig>  highlighting possible transfer of this strain between pens .

strains of mlva type  <dig> were cultured from cattle faecal samples in pen  <dig> in november and again in december . e. coli o <dig> strains with mlva type  <dig> were cultured in december from faeces from the floor of pen  <dig> and in a feed sample in pen  <dig>  by january this mlva type was detected in the four cattle faecal isolates in pen  <dig>  showing a probable horizontal transmission route through feed/feed troughs .

strains of mlva type  <dig> were cultured in feed trough swab samples in pen  <dig> in november and by december strains with this type were detected in feed trough swab samples in pens  <dig> and  <dig> . isolates from the dividing bars located between pens  <dig> and  <dig> and again between pens  <dig> and  <dig>  in december, included strains with indistinguishable mlva types. a similar profile was observed in isolates obtained from the same sites in january , suggesting horizontal transmission between adjacent pens.

strains of mlva type  <dig> were cultured in cattle faecal samples in pen  <dig> in november and by december this strain was cultured from cattle faecal samples in pen  <dig> and in feed samples cultured in pen  <dig> in january .

strains of mlva type  <dig> were cultured from water trough swab samples in january and by february strains with this profile were cultured from pen floor faeces in pens  <dig> and  <dig>  and the agitated water in the water trough located between pens  <dig> and  <dig>  highlighting water as a possible transmission source of this pathogen . the e. coli o <dig> strains displaying mlva type  <dig> were only cultured from slurry tank faeces.

discussion
our data show that, the application of mlva to broadly discriminate between different strains of e. coli o <dig> may be a useful tool to aid in detecting strain dissemination patterns. mlva could separate isolates into clusters dividing the fifty-four isolates into twelve different mlva types. as no e. coli o <dig> was detected from environmental samples prior to restocking, these data support the conclusions of minihan et al.,   <cit>  that animals entering the feedlot and shedding e. coli o <dig> at initial stocking, are an important source of contamination. these animals are probably responsible for the initial inoculation of the immediate environment. once e. coli o <dig> inoculated the feedlot, water troughs, pen bars, pen floor faeces and feed all became important sources for transmission of the organism.

application of a mlva typing scheme in a veterinary setting presents unique challenges. choice of the tr loci for the analysis is an important step in the success of any subtyping protocol. as several loci specific to e. coli o <dig> were previously characterised by noller et al.,   <cit> , these markers were included in this study. these tr loci along with others have been previously applied in other studies, for example, four of the seven loci were included by lindstedt et al.,   <cit>  in their study and all seven loci were included in a study by keys et al.,   <cit> . other tr markers have been defined more recently  <cit> .

based on our data, we calculated diversity indices for the seven tr loci with values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . the highest level of diversity observed  related to tr- <dig> and this was the most polymorphic locus observed in our study. similar observations were reported earlier by noller et al.,   <cit> , keys et al.,   <cit>  and by kawamori et al.,   <cit> . it was previously suggested by keys et al.,   <cit>  that markers with high diversities are crucial in discriminating between closely related isolates. keys et al.,  <cit>  highlighted the importance of including tr- <dig> , as an example of a crucial marker.

careful interpretation of data obtained from the analysis of highly discriminating loci, in closely related strains and detecting strain differences between distantly related strains is important in sub-typing. mutational rates differ within tandem repeat loci thereby increasing the polymorphism associated with these markers. noller et al.,   <cit> , defined isolates as belonging to the same lineage when no more than a single vntr difference occurred between all loci. based on our vntr data, tr- <dig> was highly polymorphic and few of our isolates conformed to nollers' definition.

interestingly, the majority of the strains examined in this study had no repeats at the tr <dig> locus and were designated as "00" whilst the remaining strains contained just one or two repeats as indicated by the identifiers "01" or "02" respectively . comparing these data to those reported earlier by noller et al.,   <cit> , highlighted differences in repeat number  which may  reflect the origin of our strain collection, compared to others . nonetheless the mst generated based on these data, facilitated the localised tracing of routes of dissemination in the pens, as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

the environment of the feedlot was highlighted as an important source of transmission of e. coli o <dig> when a single strain was detected in the pen floor faeces in pen  <dig>  sediment samples from the water trough located between pens  <dig> and  <dig> and from the pen bar barriers between pens  <dig> and  <dig> in january . once contaminated the environment had the potential to act as a reservoir of infection/re-infection not only for cattle, but also for other possible vectors including flies and rodents  <cit> .

in this study, e. coli o <dig> was detected in both feed and water troughs, which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . on many farms, water troughs are infrequently cleaned which gives rise eventually to the development of thick sediments accumulating, along with biofilm formation. these may then serve as a long-term source of pathogen infection of bovine and other animals  <cit> . as cattle in two or more feedlot pens may drink from communal water troughs, our study highlighted the importance of having drinking systems in place, designed to minimize the entry of faecal material. in feedlot design, consideration should be given to the incorporation of unique water trough access to each pen. feed troughs should also be designed in such a way that they are not amenable to faecal contamination, and inter-pen transmission. attention should also be paid to the risks posed by human traffic moving between pens within a feedlot environment.

the application of mlva is a useful tool in broadly establishing the dissemination routes of e. coli o <dig> in the environment. this sub-typing protocol facilitated the description of the dissemination patterns among a collection of isolates and the identification of important risk factors. choice of the repeat loci to include in the analysis is important, as highlighted by the findings of this and other studies. noller et al.,   <cit>  recently put forward suggestions for the interpretation of mlva data. in the future loci used to investigate animal and human populations of e. coli o <dig> should be standardised, facilitating an improved understanding of the dissemination of this human pathogen through the food chain. nevertheless, mlva is a technique that could be applied by most laboratories and as we have shown, these modern laboratory tools can usefully support on-farm management practices aimed at reducing the transmission of this important human pathogen, early in the food chain.

CONCLUSIONS
through the use of mlva, our study demonstrates some of the transmission routes of e. coli o <dig>  cultured from bovine animals. strain diversity was observed within pens, individual animals and their environment. the overlap between pens suggests dissemination of the bacterium within the feedlot environment with possible involvement of selection pressures for those specific strains in the same environment. our data also suggested that cohorts of cattle can be exposed to and become asymptomatic carriers of a number of e. coli o <dig> strains differentiated according to their mlva profiles  <cit> . results obtained provided an insight into the longitudinal dynamics of e. coli o <dig> dissemination and identified dominant strains emerging and re-emerging over time  <cit> . the implementation of good hygiene practices along with other biosecurity measures linked to mlva profiling may help to control the dissemination of e. coli o <dig> within a feedlot environment and contribute to improvements in haccp-based management plans, to protect public health.
