BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  is a major pathogenic agent causing disease worldwide. it can lead to many kinds of extraintestinal diseases, including newborn meningitis, sepsis, and urinary tract disease  <cit> . it has been reported to cause death in animals and humans in europe and north america  <cit> . expec can be distinguished from intestinal pathogenic e. coli and commensal e. coli by isolation site and genetic patterns  <cit> . based on the isolation site, expec can be classified as uropathogenic e. coli , avian pathogenic e. coli , newborn meningitis e. coli  or sepsis e. coli . the infectivity of expec involves various extraintestinal virulence-associated factors in microbe-host interactions, rather than a simple mechanism  <cit> . genome plasticity of expec is the basis for rapid adaptation to the changing environment, which in turn increases the diversity of e. coli populations.

expec is a major pathogen in the swine industry, responsible for considerable economic losses  <cit> . alongside rapid development of industrial swine husbandry in china, an increasing trend of porcine expec outbreaks has become an urgent problem  <cit> . furthermore, the similarities in expec isolates from human and animal infection cases suggest that there is cross-infection potential between different hosts, including humans, companion animals, pigs and birds  <cit> . i.e., expec has high zoonotic potential, which makes porcine expec a significant danger to public health.


e. coli consists of phylogenetic groups, namely a, b <dig>  b <dig> and d. most virulent expec strains belong to group b <dig>  followed by group d. generally, isolates assigned to groups a or b <dig> are less likely to cause disease in healthy animals  <cit> . the presence of virulence-related  genes has a close connection with the virulence phenotype. many genes have been identified as vr in expec, and are involved in adhesion , invasion , iron acquisition , toxicity  and surface protection   <cit> . to identify combinations of vr genes associated with disease, the virulence genotyping method has previously been used in studies of upec  <cit> . however, such data is still limited for porcine expec. in this study, we performed virulence genotyping, animal infection experiments and multilocus sequence typing  analysis, to provide insight into the associations between genotypes, phylogenetic groups and virulence phenotypes of expec.

RESULTS

phylogenetic group classification revealed that  <dig> %  of the porcine expec isolates belonged to group b <dig>   <dig> %  to group b <dig>   <dig> %  to group a and  <dig> %  to group d. the phylogenetic group classification was associated with genetic patterns. the average number of vr genes in phylogenetic group b <dig>  was significantly higher than that in groups a , b <dig> , and d  . hlyd, ibea, usp, cnf <dig>  papa were only observed in group b <dig> and sfaa, afa were only detected in group a. irea, papa, sfaa, afa, kpsmiii, ibea were rarely detected in any of the phylogenetic groups. additional file 2: table s <dig> shows statistical analysis of associations between virulence-associated factors.

cluster structure analysis
based on virulence gene profiles, four virulence clusters  were identified using bionumerics software according to a previous method . seven strains belonged to cluster i, with an average of  <dig>  virulence-associated genes per strain. four stains belonged to cluster ii, with average of  <dig>  virulence-associated genes. cluster iii contained  <dig> isolates, with an average of  <dig>  virulence–associated genes. cluster iv contained seven isolates with an average  <dig> virulence–associated genes. in general, the virulence of phylogenetic group b <dig> e. coli isolates is considered to be highest, followed by group d, which is in turn higher than that of phylogenetic groups a or b <dig>  <cit> . in this study, all phylogenetic group b <dig> isolates were found in cluster iv. the dependency between cluster iv and phylogenetic group b <dig> was significant , but no significance was found between other clusters and phylogenetic groups. in addition, it was always observed the number of virulence-associated genes in an isolate was significantly correlated with its phylogenetic group, thus b <dig> isolates contained more virulence-associated genes than non-b <dig> isolates . the prevalence of virulence-associated genes between clusters was also compared , but no characteristic pattern was found for expec. however, the presence of hlyd, ibea, usp, cnf <dig>  papa in cluster iv is a difference from the other three clusters, indicating that those five genes are possible markers for the prediction of highly virulent expec.fig.  <dig> clustering of the  <dig> expec isolates based on the presence or absence of virulence-associated factors. each column shows the results for a single gene. black: gene present; blank: gene absent

mlst analysis
among  <dig> isolates belonging to phylogenetic groups d and b <dig>   <dig> different sts were identified, including  <dig> known sts  . two novel sts were identified in this study, namely, st <dig> and st <dig>  four sts included all seven b <dig> group isolates, namely st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  other sts were found for group d isolates. to further analyze the phylogenetic relationships of these  <dig> expec isolates, a phylogenetic tree were generated . the phylogenetic analysis showed that the group b <dig> and group d isolates could each be grouped . all isolates in the group b <dig> section of the tree were classified into cluster iv in the virulence genotyping analysis; the isolates in the group d part of the tree were from clusters i, ii and iii .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic organization of group b <dig> and d isolates of different multi locus sequence types based on the neighbor-joining method. numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values and the bar represents  <dig>  nucleotide changes. group b <dig> strains gather together , as do group d strains 




eburst analysis of these  <dig> isolates identified nine clonal complex , namely, cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig> . st <dig> is a single locus variant  of st <dig>  which is the primary founder of cc <dig>  st <dig> was connected to st <dig> as a member of cc <dig>  three sts were not classified into any ccs, i.e., they were singletons . strains from cc <dig> and cc <dig> have been indicated to have strong pathogenicity and zoonotic potential .fig.  <dig> eburst analysis of  <dig> sts of porcine extraintestinal escherichia coli. the clonal structure of expec is demonstrated by eburst plots based on the profile of seven allelic housekeeping genes. two sts differing in one locus but sharing the other six loci constitute a single locus variant ; a double locus variant  means the sts contain two different loci. sts that did not include any slvs with others are termed singletons. we observed nine main clonal complexes , and three singletons . strains from the same ancestor are grouped together in blue circles

virulence evaluation of representative expec isolates
seven group b <dig> strains selected from cluster iv showed high virulence in a mouse infection model : the mortalities varied from 60%  to 100%  at a challenge dose of 4 × 107 cfu; the mortalities were more diverse at a challenge dose of 4 × 106 cfu, but of particular note, isolate jx <dig> caused 100% mortality , indicating high virulence. the  <dig> group d strains showed obvious diversity in virulence: pxecz01c and pxeczf4d did not cause any mortality at a dose of 4 × 107 cfu, while strains sxe- <dig> and sxe- <dig> presented high virulence; all of group d strains have no pathogenicity at a challenge dose of 4 × 106 cfu. no abnormality was found in mice in the control group injected with pbs.table  <dig> experimental virulence of representative isolates in balb/c mice

all these strains were able to kill balb/c mice in doses of 108 cfu, including pxecz01c and pxeczf4d




discussion
the importance of expec has been recognized, and many expec related diseases in cows, humans and food have been reported in the north america and europe. in china, expec has become a frequent pathogen in the swine industry  <cit> . however, understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of porcine expec is still limited. some reports showed that >50% of expec isolates from swine belong to phylogenetic groups a and b <dig>  <cit> , which is consistent with our results. in this study, only a few isolates were classified as phylogenetic group b <dig>  which is an obvious contrast with the fact that most expecs isolated from humans or companion animals belong to groups b <dig> and d  <cit> . in this study, the isolates were considered as expec based organ origin. johnson et al  <cit>  proposed a molecular approach to delimit expec, by considering the presence of  <dig> of the  <dig> virulence markers  in an e. coli strain as expec. according to this criterion,  <dig> of  <dig> strains in this study were identified as expec, which contained all  <dig> b <dig> strains . notably, the prevalence of expec that qualified to criterion was larger within high virulence strains  than within low virulence strains  in the mouse infection model. this indicated that johnson’s criterion is more strict and selective compared to the robust standard we used in this study, and is able to identify strains with a higher potential to cause diseases.

a single virulence factor does not determine bacterial pathogenicity. thus, in this study,  <dig> major virulence-associated genes of expec were selected for a comprehensive analysis with phylogenetic investigation, aiming to reveal genotypic traits related to virulence. these  <dig> virulence-associated genes contribute to the fitness of expec and increase its adaptability and competitiveness in colonizing host animals. four clusters were identified in the genotyping analysis. cluster iv included only b <dig> group isolates and showed a higher prevalence of virulence-associated genes than the other three clusters. animal infection experiments confirmed higher virulence of isolates from cluster iv, which is consistent with b <dig> group strains leading to serious diseases  <cit> . the distinction between b <dig> and non-b <dig> expec is clear, shown by mlst, virulence genotyping and virulence assessment. in addition, group d expec isolates are considered to be more pathogenic than groups a and b <dig>  although in this study some group d strains presented similar virulence to group a or b <dig> isolates. furthermore, group d isolates were mixed with group a and b <dig> isolates in clusters i, ii and iii in the genotyping analysis. in mlst analysis, no obvious correlations were observed with genotypic cluster virulence in group d strains. group d isolates thus present high diversity in genotype and phenotype.

mlst analysis can provide other information besides phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . after comparing our results with the mlst database , we found sts in this study that have been reported to be present in diseases of birds, dogs and humans. for example, strain jx <dig> belonged to st <dig> in cc95; st <dig> is the most important pathogenic sequence type in human-associated cases  <cit> . st <dig> isolates are frequently reported to be related to newborn meningitis  and uropathogenic infection  in europe and the north america  <cit> . group d isolate czn3c is assigned to st <dig>  which is a common st type in isolates causing uti and nm in humans, companion animals and swine  <cit> . some st <dig> isolates lead to uti in avians and companion animals  <cit> , but several group d st <dig> isolates showed low virulence in this study. our data suggest that isolates from the same st can have different pathogenic phenotypes, and indicate the diversity and complexity of pathogenic e. coli.

a study by tan et al. showed that fimh, trat and iuta were highly prevalent in porcine expec isolates, which is in consistent with our results, but the prevalence of fyua, cnf <dig>  kpsmtii, and iron differ between our study and theirs; the focg gene was not detected in any isolates in this study, which is similar to tan’s research  <cit> . interestingly, the results of vr gene detection in expec isolates from retail pork is quite different from that from pigs on farms  <cit> . this suggests that e. coli strains isolated from pork may originate from processes such as meat production or transportation.

we found five vr genes to be highly prevalent specifically in cluster iv , namely papa, hlyd, usp, ibea and cnf <dig>  suggesting that these five genes may be closely related to strong pathogenicity. this result contains a risk factor that similar geographical of b <dig> isolated in this study might lead to a prevalence bias of virulence factors. both hlyd and cnf <dig> are well-known toxin genes in expec. ibea is associated with neonatal meningitis  <cit>  and is an important virulence-associated factor widely distributed among apec and nmec  <cit> . usp, the uropathogenic-specific gene, was reported in a large number of strains from patients and animals with pyelonephritis or prostatitis  <cit> . both our results and a previous study of virulence genotypes of canine expec  <cit>  indicate that cnf <dig>  hlyd, ups and kpsmii could be possible marker genes for high virulence in expec, although this point still needs to be verified in further study or using a larger collection of expec isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a total of  <dig> vr genes in  <dig> chinese porcine expec strains were detected by pcr. based on vr gene profiles, those isolates were divided into four clusters . notably, all cluster iv isolates were from group b <dig>  and vr genes were remarkably more prevalent in group b <dig> than in groups a, b <dig> and d. the distinction between group b <dig> and non-b <dig> isolates in virulence and genotype accorded with mlst analysis. considering cluster iv isolates had the strongest pathogenicity in a mouse infection model, genes that were only found in group b <dig> strains  could be possible marker genes for high virulence in expec. this study revealed the genetic differences between porcine expec strains from china and enlarges the knowledge of the porcine expec virulence.
