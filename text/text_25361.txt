BACKGROUND
one of the simplest mechanisms for controlling gene transcription response to environmental cues is mediated through a "two component" or "his-to-asp" signal transduction system. in its most minimal configuration, this system is composed of two polypeptides, a sensor kinase and a response regulator protein that communicate via phosphotransfer events . a phosphoryl group is moved from a conserved histidine residue within the sensor kinase protein to an aspartic acid residue on its cognate response regulator. the response regulator impacts transcriptional activity by influencing promotor selection via its interaction with selected dna targets  <cit>  and with rna polymerase  <cit> . his-to-asp signal transduction systems were first characterized in escherichia coli  <cit> . in eubacteria,  <dig> to more than  <dig> his-to-asp proteins have been shown to occur . recent complete genome sequencing endeavours document that the cyanobacterial genomes of synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> and anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> contain about  <dig> and  <dig> general signal transduction proteins, respectively  <cit> .

given the endosymbiotic origin of plastids from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor  <cit> , it is not surprising that genes for his-to-asp signal transducers have been found encoded in chloroplasts. in this study, the wall-less, unicellular alga heterosigma akashiwo is used as a model system for analyzing a chloroplast-encoded, two-component, signal transduction system. each h. akashiwo cell contains approximately  <dig> discoidal chloroplasts  <cit> . these organelles are surrounded by four membranes, indicative of their serial endosymbiotic origin from a putative rhodophytic ancestor  <cit> . as an obligate autotroph, h. akashiwo is dependent on chloroplast function for survival and responds to changing environmental cues by rapidly altering transcript levels within the plastid  <cit> . run-on analysis clearly demonstrates that the changes in mrna abundance are largely due to transcript initiation  <cit> .

this report presents data suggesting that the heterosigma akashiwo response regulator component  <cit>  of a his-to-asp signal transduction circuit interacts with a nuclear-encoded sigma  <dig>  subunit of a eubacterial-like rna polymerase to modulate chloroplast gene transcription. we propose that this simplified two-component/σ <dig> – partnership found in h. akashiwo may offer insight to a mechanism by which chloroplast gene transcription is controlled in certain algal taxa.

RESULTS
tsg <dig> – a sensor kinase protein
the heterosigma akashiwo chloroplast genome  <cit>  contains a single his-to-asp sensor kinase . the presence of a chloroplast encoded his-to-asp sensor kinase gene is not universal in stramenopiles or other plastid-containing organisms . a tsg <dig> homologue is found in the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi  but not in the chloroplasts of the bacillariophytes odontella sinensis, phaeodactylum tricornutum and thalassiosira pseudonana, the pelagophyte aureoumbra lagunensis, the cryptophyte guillardia theta, and the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa. in rhodophytes, a tsg <dig> homologue is encoded in the chloroplasts of cyanidium caldarium , gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui , porphyra purpurea  and p. yezoensis , but is absent in cyanidioschyzon merolae. no tsg <dig> genes have been identified in any chlorophyte or charophyte examined to date.

the dashed lines  indicate that the complete chloroplast genome for that taxon is not available, so the presence or absence of the gene is unknown. np indicates not present.

the predicted amino acid sequence of heterosigma akashiwo tsg <dig>  has a shorter n terminus than that observed in rhodophytic algal sensor proteins and similar proteins found in cyanobacteria . tsg <dig> lacks the transmembrane and hamp domains  <cit>  observed in some cyanobacterial and all chloroplast-encoded rhodophytic homologues , but it maintains the regions that contain the hiska and hatpase domains. the tsg <dig> protein has a weak pas domain  that aligns with the well defined pas domains of sensor kinases from porphyra purpurea, gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui, cyanidium caldarium, and synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> .

the heterosigma akashiwo tsg <dig> kinase domain  displays a highly conserved h box  whose consensus amino acid array helrtp identifies this protein as a type  <dig>  histidine kinase  <cit> . excellent sequence fidelity of the histidine kinase atp binding site is also maintained for the n, g <dig>  f and g <dig> motifs, including the conserved glycine g <dig> at its terminus  <cit> . the h to n distance between the histidine of the h box and the asparagine of the kinase domain is indicative of histidine kinase subtypes  <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid residues that lie between h and n in h. akashiwo tsg <dig> and its homologues in the rhodophytic and chromophytic taxa are consistent with a type  <dig> sensor protein identity. nine lysine and three arginine residues contribute to the net positively charged amino acid sequence between the histidine kinase and atpase domains in the h. akashiwo protein. tsg <dig> of both h. akashiwo and rhodophytes shows close sequence similarity to the proteins hik <dig> and nbls that serve as monitors of environmental stress in cyanobacteria  <cit> .

trg <dig> – a winged helix-turn-helix protein
two identical copies of trg <dig> were found on the chloroplast genome of heterosigma akashiwo, one on each copy of the inverted repeat. the distribution of trg <dig> is varied among disparate taxa . the trg <dig> gene has not been found in the pelagophyte aureoumbra lagunensis. this gene is also missing from both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of thalassiosira pseudonana and phaeodactylum tricornutum as well as the chloroplast genome of odontella sinensis. a single copy of the trg <dig> gene has been identified in the chloroplast genomes of the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi , the cryptophyte guillardia theta , and the rhodophytes cyanidioschyzon merolae , gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui , porphyra purpurea , p. yezoensis , porphyridium aerugineum  and rhodella violacea , whereas the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa, has one full copy  and a partial fragment of this gene . the rhodophyte cyanidium caldarium chloroplast encodes two complete copies of trg <dig> , though these genes are relatively divergent from each other . interestingly, a trg1-like gene  has been identified in the plastid genome of the charophyte chlorokybus atmophyticus.

western analysis was used to demonstrate that the trg <dig> protein is expressed in vivo. data shown in figure  <dig> confirmed the presence of trg <dig> protein in exponentially growing heterosigma akashiwo cells that were harvested at l <dig> of a  <dig> h light: <dig> h dark growth cycle. an expected protein band of  <dig> kda was present when cell extracts were exposed to post-bleed antiserum  and was absent in the lane exposed to preadsorption control  and prebleed antiserum . these data confirmed that the low abundance message for the trg <dig> gene  <cit>  is translated into a protein product.

response-regulatory proteins, such as trg <dig>  contain a receiver domain and a dna recognition domain. the dna recognition domain affects gene expression by interacting with both dna and with rna polymerase  <cit> . the inferred amino acid sequence of heterosigma akashiwo trg <dig> was compared with trg1-like sequences from thermotoga maritima  and escherichia coli  for which tertiary structures have been determined  <cit> . a number of conserved regions are shared among these sequences both within the receiver domain and dna binding domain .

comparison of heterosigma akashiwo trg <dig> and thermotoga maritima ompr shows good three-dimensional similarity . to gain insight into h. akashiwo trg1-rna polymerase structure/function relationship as a possible transcriptional regulator of chloroplast genes, we constructed a model of the dna binding domain for this protein. because t. maritima lacks the α2-α <dig> polymerase loop, our model of this region is based on available three-dimensional structures for ompr and phob. ompr has an x-ray generated structure  <cit>  at  <dig>  Å resolution  whereas the phob report represents an nmr  derived structure  <cit> . structures of ompr and phob have been previously compared, and our observations are based upon that comparison  <cit> . the most notable differences between ompr and phob occur in the putative eubacterial-like rna polymerase contact loop  and at the loop between helix α <dig> and strand β <dig>  the higher sequence similarity between trg <dig> and phob in the α2-α <dig> region leads us to believe that phob is a better structure model for residues 130– <dig> and similarly ompr for residues 209– <dig> . thus, we constructed a chimeric model from these two portions, which yielded satisfactory internal and external environments for most residues.

mutational analysis of the phob "rna polymerase loop" region shows that the amino acids w <dig>  g <dig>  v <dig> and d <dig> are needed for successful association of this response regulator protein with the σ <dig> subunit of prokaryotic rna polymerase  <cit> . the first two of these amino acids are present in trg <dig>  but v <dig> is conservatively replaced by i <dig>  and the d <dig> has been replaced with a non-conservative i <dig> . similar to observations in heterosigma akashiwo trg <dig>  conservation of a phob-like domain is found within the response regulator α2-α <dig> loops of some cyanobacteria and proteobacteria, as well as in chloroplasts . the observation that the h. akashiwo trg <dig> α2-α <dig> loop is two amino acids longer than that seen in phob and ompr suggests that either the response regulator may interact with a undescribed rna polymerase subunit or the rna polymerase subunit itself may also be modified.

the putative rna polymerase association loop domain was identified in prokaryotic and plastid-encoded response regulators based on molecular modelling for trg <dig>  phob, and ompr  <cit> . for easy comparison in the table – the data for trg <dig>  phob, and ompr are bolded.

presence of rpod in heterosigma akashiwo
data presented above support the hypothesis that heterosigma akashiwo trg <dig> interacts with a σ70-like subunit of a eubacterial-like rna polymerase. sequence analysis of h. akashiwo revealed the presence of a nuclear-encoded rpod gene. the presence of both a signal peptide sequence and a putative stromal targeting domain on the amino terminus of the rpod protein supports the hypothesis that this protein is chloroplast-targeted . although h. akashiwo rpod lacks the autoinhibitory  <dig>  region, it retains the highly conserved functional domains  that have been elucidated for eubacterial homologues . most striking in the context of this study is the extensive maintenance of sequence identity within domains  <dig>  and  <dig>  among phylogenetically diverse organisms . this domain is responsible for interaction with transcriptional regulator proteins and with the - <dig> promotor array  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of rpod/σ <dig> have been published for some eubacteria  <cit> , and land plants  <cit> . we attempted to generate a phylogeny to place heterosigma akashiwo rpod among other photosynthetic eukaryotes . since this comparison yielded few regions that could be confidently aligned, the resulting trees were consistently poorly supported as measured by bootstrap values and posterior probabilities . a consistent phylogenetic result, however, was the placement of h. akashiwo rpod as sister to one of the six rpod/sig sequences that had been annotated from the complete nuclear genome of thalassiosira pseudonana  <cit> .

a number of problems common in phylogenetic inference could explain our difficulty in generating a robust phylogeny. these include problems associated with parology, lineage sorting and horizontal gene transfer , long-branch attraction  <cit> , and rate heterogeneity among lineages  <cit> .

discussion
most plausibly, the prokaryotic ancestor of eukaryotic chloroplasts were fully equipped with their own multifaceted signal transduction circuitry  <cit> , as observed in cyanobacterial and proteobacterial genomes which encode multiple sensor kinase/response regulator pairs  <cit> . since the chloroplast must respond to both extra- and intra-cellular cues, one might anticipate strict conservation of these signal transduction arrays. however, given the observations that fewer sensor/response circuits exist in intracellular bacterial pathogens than in free-living representatives  <cit> , one may argue that a reduction in the ancestral plastid genome size after endosymbiosis may have driven the loss of chloroplast-encoded his-to-asp regulatory arrays .

the chloroplast genomes  of several rhodophytic algae  <cit> , the glaucophyte cyanophora paradoxa  <cit> , the haptophyte emiliania huxleyi  <cit> , the cryptophyte guillardia theta  <cit> , and the charophyte chlorokybus atmophyticus  <cit>  have been shown to encode the response regulator gene and in some, the sensor kinase gene for the his-to-asp proteins. the presumptive loss of the sensor kinase seen in some chloroplast genomes may suggest that under such a circumstance, the regulatory protein may be governed by nuclear-encoded sensor kinases or by yet undescribed accessory proteins that are either of nuclear or chloroplast origin . the occurrence of this signalling array is less well documented in stramenopiles. the chloroplast genome of the raphidophyte heterosigma akashiwo encodes a single response regulator and its cognate sensor kinase , but the chloroplast genomes of representatives within the bacillariophytes and the pelagophytes lack both proteins of this two-component system  <cit> . more than  <dig> green plant  chloroplast genomes have been sequenced. of these only the charophyte chlorokybus atmophyticus encodes a response regulator protein. it should be noted, however, that partial footprints of  prokaryotic his-to-asp transduction pairs have been identified in some green-plant nuclear genomes  <cit> . such truncated his-to-asp constructs have been shown to signal mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, which cause the differential regulation of targeted genes  <cit> .

the taxonomic distribution of this gene-pair is poorly understood. complete chloroplast genomes are few, especially in species-rich lineages that are represented by only a small number of complete chloroplast genomes . whether the maintenance of the his-to-asp signal transduction apparatus in the chloroplast corresponds to established phylogenies remains to be determined. one might anticipate that the chloroplasts of chromophytic algae would retain this his-to-asp array since they are the product of a serial endosymbiotic event, which involved a rhodophytic algal ancestor. unfortunately, data for the diverse taxonomic assemblage of chromophytes has been both minimal and conflicting. the presence of the his-to-asp array in heterosigma akashiwo appears to reflect the retention of an ancestral signature. whether the loss of the his-to-asp pair in bacillariophyte chloroplast dna represents a derived genotype, remains an open question. regardless of phylogenetic profile, the evolutionary retention of all or part of a his-to-asp signal transduction circuit in some distantly related algal chloroplasts strongly suggests that this biochemical mechanism must play an important role in the maintenance of chloroplast homeostasis.

we propose that the heterosigma akashiwo tsg1/trg <dig> signal transduction pair, in concert with an rna polymerase σ <dig> subunit, is involved in regulating chloroplast gene transcription. the environmental stimulus that regulates the signal transduction response remains elusive. the inability to create gene-knockout mutants or perform transformation experiments in chromophytic algae  has hampered gene expression studies that are needed to provide direct evidence for the role of his/asp systems in chloroplast function. however, one might infer function given the similarity of the chloroplast-encoded h. akashiwo tsg <dig> and the ycf26-encoded proteins of emiliania huxleyi, cyanidium caldarium, gracilaria tenuistipitata var. liui, porphyra purpurea and p. yezoensis to the cyanobacterial sensor kinases and nbls. hik <dig> has been shown by deletion studies to impact the expression of selected genes in response to osmotic and low temperature stress  <cit> , while its homologue nbls is reported to serve as a sensor of nutrient stress and high light intensity  <cit> . the underlying mechanism driving these physiological responses may be governed by redox and light signals for two reasons :  both hik <dig> and nbls possess a pas domain, which is thought to be involved in redox and light sensing  <cit>  and,  a large majority of the genes impacted by hik <dig> and nbls are related to photosynthesis  <cit> . it has been proposed that redox control of gene expression is a fundamental evolutionary selection mechanism responsible for the maintenance of chloroplast-encoded gene regulation systems  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the h. akashiwo tsg <dig> protein has a putative pas domain. while the three dimensional structure of pas domains is conserved among taxa, the primary protein sequences that comprise this motif are often diverse  <cit> . as more types of pas domains are characterized, the e-value for the pas domain in h. akashiwo tsg <dig> should become more robust.

an important difference between heterosigma akashiwo tsg <dig> and its homologues is the absence of a transmembrane region and a hamp domain. the possibility of a split tsg <dig> gene was not supported by detailed analysis of the completely sequenced h. akashiwo chloroplast genome. the absence of a transmembrane region implies that tsg <dig> is most likely present in the stroma. though the majority of described tsg <dig> proteins are putatively membrane bound , soluble histidine kinases have been identified  <cit> . studies are underway using a tsg <dig> peptide antibody to verify the location of the protein in the cell.

contrary to a previous report  <cit> , our data indicate that rpab in the cyanobacterium synechocystis shares not only similarity to the ycf <dig> proteins in red algae but also to h. akashiwo trg <dig>  the premise that ycf <dig> homologues are restricted to eukaryotic algae containing phycobilisomes  <cit>  is contrary to the description of this protein in the non-phycobilisome containing algae – heterosigma akashiwo   <cit> , guillardia theta   <cit> , emiliania huxleyi   <cit> , and chlorokybus atmophyticus  <cit> . nonetheless, the hypothesis that rpab regulates the synthesis of  "factors required to couple phycobilisomes to ps <dig> or psii"  <cit>  is consistent with the possible role of this protein in redox/light sensing.

the assignment of heterosigma akashiwo trg <dig> to the "class 2"  of transcriptional regulators offers additional insight to its function in the plastid. in prokaryotic cells, some "class 2" proteins  regulate transcription through interaction with the σ subunit of rna polymerase  <cit>  while others associate with the α subunit of this enzyme  <cit> . we have identified a phob-like signature for the rna polymerase recognition domain in trg <dig> and a putative chloroplast-targeted σ <dig> subunit in h. akashiwo. a comparable transcriptional mechanism appears to be present in cyanidioschyzon merolae, cyanidium caldarium, and guillardia theta as both phob-like signatures and σ subunits have been identified   <cit> .

sigma factors in concert with core rna polymerase selectively target chloroplast genes for transcription. for example, the prokaryotic-like, plastid-encoded polymerases with their associated σ factor exclusively transcribe many genes that impact the photosynthetic process including rbcl, psba, psbd, petb, ndha, atpi, atph and rps <dig>  <cit> . both plastid-encoded polymerase and the phage-like nuclear-encoded polymerase can transcribe rrna, atpb, clpp. it should be noted however, that these eubacterial rna polymerase-associated σ factors often interact with regulatory proteins  and this association may further influence the transcription of specific genes  <cit> .

how could the transcription of a small, select set of genes impact chloroplast homeostasis? one might propose that a hierarchical assembly of proteins during the formation of molecular complexes could provide an exceptionally efficient mechanism for regulating the quantitative and qualitative production of molecular structures necessary for the maintenance of chloroplast function. in the chloroplast, many large functional complexes that drive oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon fixation are constructed with a definitive stoichiometry that reflects the cooperative interaction between plastid and nuclear genomes. studies suggest that protein complex formation is regulated by the presence of a "dominant assembly partner" whose presence assures the production of its assembly associates in the correct proportions  <cit> . for example, a chlamydomonas mutant lacking the d <dig> protein  expresses only minimal levels of d <dig>  as well as cp <dig>  proteins. similarly, mutants in cp <dig>  or d <dig>  show depressed concentrations of d <dig>  protein. in contrast, chlamydomonas cells that were mutated in cp <dig>  were able to assemble d <dig>  d <dig> and cp <dig> into a stable complex. the existence of such an assembly cascade is not restricted to photosystem ii construction. when cytochrome b <dig>  or subunit iv  are not present, cytochrome f  synthesis drops to 10% of that in wild type cells. a similar synthesis cascade appears also to occur in the biogenesis of atp synthetase, which is comprised of five subunits . mutants lacking β will not accumulate any other core peptide. in effect, a minimal signal transduction system  in conjunction with the σ subunit  may have given the ancestral eukaryotic cell a simple and efficient method to integrate chimeric gene sets.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a his-to-asp signal transduction array in the secondary endosymbiotic chloroplast of the stramenopile heterosigma akashiwo. these proteins are similar to those found in bacteria and in the chloroplast genomes of several, though not all, algae.

this study generated a number of interesting questions. for example, why have several of the red lineage chloroplasts retained all or part of the his-to-asp signal transduction system while only a single green chloroplast lineage retained this system? will the sensor kinase protein be more frequently missing from this pair as additional stramenopile chloroplast genomes are analyzed? are there undescribed chloroplast-encoded proteins that can substitute for sensor kinases? are all sensor kinases triggered by the same or by different environmental cues? what are those cues? when more than one rpod protein is present in an organism , does one member of this σ <dig> factor family interact with the regulator protein or do different sigma/response regulators form partnerships that control the expression of specific gene sets? with the advent of high throughput genome sequencing, more effective bioinformatics/evolutionary analysis as well as extensive molecular studies of cellular processes are now possible. from the questions posed above, it is evident that events associated with chloroplast gene regulation will continue to provide a challenging field for future research.
