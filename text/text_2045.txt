BACKGROUND
magnesium is the most abundant divalent alkaline ion in living cells and it is an indispensable element for many biological processes. magnesium deficiency in humans is responsible for many diseases including osteoporosis  <cit>  or metabolic syndrome , a combination of different metabolic disorders that increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes  <cit> . magnesium is characterised by specific chemico-physical properties: it is redox inert, it has a small ionic radius and is consequently endowed with a high charge density  <cit> . in cells magnesium ions have both structural and functional roles. magnesium plays a key role in stabilising protein structures, phosphate groups of membrane lipids and negatively charged phosphates of nucleic acids. concomitantly, it is also involved in catalytic roles, such as the activation/inhibition of many enzymes  <cit> .

observations on the structural geometry of mg2+ binding sites in proteins known with atomic resolution may be derived from procognate, a cognate ligand domain mapping for enzymes  <cit>  and from the protein data bank . typical magnesium binding sites on proteins show three or fewer direct binding contacts with carbonyl oxygen atoms of the backbone and/or protein side chains, with a tendency to bind water molecules given the octahedral coordination geometry of the divalent cation  <cit> . it is known that mg2+ binding sites are less specific than those of other divalent cations such as zn2+ and ca2+, and that in particular conditions, zn2+ can dislocate mg2+ from its pocket  <cit> . apparently metal binding sites on proteins seem to satisfy constraints related to the physiological availability of the ions  <cit> . magnesium binds weakly to proteins and enzymes   <cit>  and its binding affinity appears to be dependent on its high cellular concentration. free mg2+ concentration is higher than that of any other ion . as a consequence magnesium binding sites are less conserved through evolution than those of others divalent cations  <cit>  and their detection is therefore difficult. mg2+ binding sequence motifs have been described to be conserved in similar rna and dna polymerases  <cit> . three dimensional mg2+ binding pockets derived from  <dig> mg2+ binding proteins solved at atomic resolution were recognised in protein structures by implementing a structural alphabet  <cit> .

in this work we describe how to assign putative mg2+ binding sites to human proteins that lack structural information and also to proteins that share less than 30% sequence identity with any available mg2+ binding protein template. this is possible within our bar-plus annotation resource , a non hierarchical clustering method that has been recently described and relies on the pair wise sequence comparison of about  <dig> millions proteins, including  <dig> complete proteomes of different species and homo sapiens  <cit> . this paper to our knowledge describes the first large scale investigation of magnesium binding sites at the human proteome level. the results highlight that residues involved in magnesium binding in protein structures  falling into the same bar+ cluster are conserved and can be transferred to all the human sequences sharing the same cluster on the basis of structure to sequence alignment with a cluster specific hidden markov model . magnesium binding sites within a given cluster are also conserved when pair-wise sequence identity among the target and the template/s is less than 30%. a data base  is made available from where for a given human input sequence the predicted magnesium binding site/s can be retrieved with the corresponding structural template/s and the annotating bar+ cluster.

methods
the dataset of mg2+ binding protein structures
a list of  <dig>  magnesium binding protein structures was retrieved from the ligand-expo database  <cit>  by searching "mg" as mg2+ ligand identifier. the expo database is a data warehouse that integrates databases, services and tools related to small molecules bound to macromolecules and based on pdb. it allows users to extract ligand information directly from the pdb, to perform chemical substructure searches of pdb ligands using a graphical interface and also to browse other relevant small molecule resources on the web. it is updated daily and therefore provides the most current information on small molecules present in the pdb. its reliability is based on the reliability of the structures from where information is derived and ultimately on the resolution of the electron density map of the molecule. our set includes pdbs with an average resolution  factor of  <dig>  nm. the list of magnesium binding residues and corresponding positions in the sequence for each pdb was obtained parsing both the "link" and "site" fields on the coordinate files  <cit> . in order to guarantee that magnesium is part of a biologically significant pdb structure, we filtered out fragments and chimeric structures by constraining the coverage of the template pdb structure to its uniprotkb corresponding sequence  to be ≥70%. this bound guarantees a satisfactory overlapping of the sequence to its structure and this is essential in building by homology procedures. applying this criterion, we ended up with  <dig>  pdb templates. for each pdb structure the reference sequence and the corresponding uniprotkb  <cit>  accession are obtained from the sifts web server  <cit> . in case of multiple pdbs containing different magnesium binding sites and referring to the same sequence, all the sites are mapped into the protein sequence. human sequences are collected from uniprotkb , including also splicing isoforms, for a total of  <dig>  sequences. most of these sequences are annotated in uniprotkb in an automatic way and lack any experimental evidence. when fragments are filtered out, the total number of human sequences adopted for our analysis is  <dig> .

the bar-plus annotation resource
bar+ is an annotation resource based on the notion that sequences with high identity value to a counterpart can inherit from this the same function/s and structure, if available . the method has been recently described  <cit> . briefly, an extensive blast alignment  <cit>  was performed for some  <dig> , <dig> sequences in a grid environment  <cit> . the sequence similarity network was built by connecting two proteins only if their sequence identity is ≥40% with an overlap  ≥90%.  <dig>  clusters were obtained by splitting of the connected components of the similarity network. mapping of pdb, pfam functional domains  and go terms  as listed in the uniprotkb protein files allows different annotation types within each cluster. enrichment of pfam domains  and go terms  for each cluster was statistically validated   <cit> . only when p< <dig> , terms are transferred from one protein to another one in the same cluster and annotation is inherited by all the sequences in the cluster. when a sequence falls into a validated cluster it can inherit in a validated manner functional and structural annotation . stand alone sequences are called singletons . clusters can contain distantly related proteins that by this procedure can be annotated with high confidence. we verified that the magnesium containing  <dig>  pdb structures were in bar+ clusters and when not present, we included them in the corresponding cluster. in any case we verified that backbone structure was conserved in the same cluster  was about  <dig> ± <dig>  Å) . the human sequences were then aligned against bar+ clusters and only those satisfying the bar+ constraints  were retained. out of the  <dig>  human sequences aligned towards bar+ with the required criteria, some  <dig>  fell into  <dig>  clusters and some  <dig>  aligned with singletons. the remaining portion of the human proteome  is not considered in the present analysis. in bar+, each cluster endowed with structure/s is characterised by a computed cluster hidden markov model  that is derived from a structure-to-sequence alignment within the cluster and can be adopted to model the cluster sequences on the structure template/s of the cluster  <cit> . we took advantage of the cluster hmm both for structural alignments of the newly introduced pdb structures and for sequence-to-structure alignment.

selection of the "human magnesome"
out of the above selected  <dig>  human sequences, we focused on the subset that comprises all the chains included in  <dig> clusters endowed with magnesium containing pdb structures. in our clusters, we deal with  <dig>  pdbs. we therefore checked all the pdb files, the corresponding uniprotkb files and the related literature. from this effort we were able to verify that for only  <dig> structures  in  <dig> clusters there is no published observation supporting so far any functional or structural role of mg. within the clusters, sequences could also safely inherit validated pfam functional domains and go functional terms .

binding positions were transferred from the template/s to the target after pair-wise alignment/s based on the cluster hmm.  <dig> clusters contain mg binding templates and there from an equivalent number of hmm models were used to transfer mg binding position/s to the human sequences in the clusters.  <dig> clusters contain  <dig> magnesium binding protein structures derived from non human species .  <dig> clusters contain  <dig> human templates.

RESULTS
finding magnesium binding sites with bar+
when a human sequence has a counterpart in bar+ with sequence identity ≥ 40% over at least 90% of the alignment length, it falls into the same cluster of the similar chain. in the example of figure  <dig>  when human sequence p <dig> is aligned towards the bar+ data base, the result web page identifies cluster # <dig> that comprises  <dig> sequences from eukaryotes with an average length of  <dig> residues = <dig> %) and  <dig> pdb structures with magnesium and chloride ions as ligands . the three templates are however highly similar . here we focus only on magnesium binding sites and for clarity we show only the structure of the human ubiquitin hydrolase uch-l <dig> . as shown, the structure contains  <dig> mg ions. the site field of the corresponding pdb file indicates that of the three magnesium ions one is coordinated only by water molecules and it is not considered in our analysis. the remaining two are coordinated by four and two residues, respectively . with the cluster hmm based alignment only the coordination sites including residues of the template/s are transferred to the human sequences falling into the cluster. from the cluster, the human sequence inherited all the validated features that are reported in the corresponding web page: validated go terms, the scop classification, and the pfam domain pf <dig> . bar+ gives the hmm based target/template alignment for computational modelling of the 3d structure of all the other sequences in the cluster. among these,  <dig> are from homo sapiens and inherit all the cluster specific annotation, including the mg binding sites.

bound mg in this structure is not as yet supported by any experimental observation highlighting a specific functional role. the whole bar-hmg data base contains  <dig> out of  <dig> clusters with templates binding mg without any experimental  determined functional or structural role. this information can be retrieved for each template from the corresponding pdb and uniprotkb files and the quoted literature therein. it should be considered that mg ions may play a role on protein stability still not fully described or even a role in protein-protein interaction that is at the basis of many relevant biological processes. in many instances the formation of protein complexes has not yet been recognized due to its transient characteristics. therefore the question is still open and we therefore included also these cases in our data set for a comprehensive analysis of putative mg binding sites. clusters containing templates where mg has a documented structural and functional role are labelled with a yellow star, and a yellow star and the corresponding ec number, respectively. for this reason no label is present in the figure.

annotation of mg2+ binding sites in human proteins
a structural analysis of the magnesium containing  <dig>  pdb templates indicates that the ion can be present in different ways. for this reason we list our annotation results considering that the ion co-crystallises with the protein chain either alone  or concomitantly with other ions  or ligands  or with other ions and ligands . in some instances pdb structures can combine two or more of the binding modes . results are listed by splitting human sequences that inherited annotation from human templates  from those that inherit annotation from structures of other organisms . the results are shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, where the number of sequences with low sequence identity to the cluster templates is also reported. clusters are split depending on the role of bound mg ion: functional, structural, not yet determined.

human sequences that inherit annotation from human structural templates are listed as a function of the different typologies of magnesium binding in the pdb files. the table lists the number of clusters, of structural templates, of annotated sequences  according to our procedure, of sequences never annotated before as mg binding proteins according to uniprotkb and of *sequences annotated when the target/template identity is below the 30%. three different types of clusters are identified and listed in the first column: $ cluster with structures binding mg with a recognized functional role and whit an ec number, ^ clusters with structures binding mg with a recognized structural role , ° cluster containing structures  binding mg without recognized physiological role.

table legend is as in table  <dig> 

the number of pdb human protein structures with bound magnesium  univocally identifies  <dig> template sequences; within the bar+ environment this number reaches  <dig>  . some other  <dig>  human sequences inherit annotation within bar+ clusters where the structural templates are from other organisms  .

when more pdb structures fall into the same cluster  their rmsds are very low  for all the groups. this indicates that the bar+ clusters preserve the structural specificity. therefore when a target sequence falls into a cluster characterised by mg binding, the corresponding site annotation can be safely inherited. this is so also for very distantly related sequences  that are in the same cluster.

in bar-hmg some  <dig>  human sequences are annotated as mg binding. about 98% of this set is annotated for the first time. for these sequences the corresponding uniprotkb entry neither has any information on mg binding nor contains any go term related to mg binding.

characteristics of mg2+ binding sites can be detected from a simple counting on the retrieved  <dig>  pdb structures contained in the  <dig> clusters of the bar-hmg data base. results  are split into binding sites stabilised by lateral side chains and by backbone carbonyl groups. the highest frequency is observed for asp and glu residues. similar frequency distribution is obtained when counting is done on the newly annotated human sequences . here binding is referred only to the residue type.

localising the human mg2+ binding sequences
in table  <dig> we list the most populated cellular localizations  of the human sequences  sorted out according to the different magnesium binding modes. for each go term, the number of human sequences is reported. the selected terms are those that are the most distant from the ontology root in the corresponding bar+ cluster of each sequence. similarly go terms of biological process and molecular function can be obtained for each sequence .

the "human magnesome" database
the "human magnesome" is a data base of human sequences generated after annotation with the procedure here described. the main page allows a sequence search either with a uniprotkb accession code or the fasta format of the sequence. when the sequence is present in the database it is returned with the putative magnesium binding sites, the structural templates from where it inherits magnesium binding and the number of magnesium ions present in the structural templates. different colors are displayed when the binding residues are identical, similar or different to the template reference/s. residue substitution is scored with blosum <dig> matrix. in figure  <dig> a typical output is shown. the data base is available at http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/mg.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we address the problem of annotating magnesium binding sites in proteins starting from their sequence. we take advantage of an annotation resource recently introduced , where functional and structural features derived from pdb structures are implemented into hmm models that allows sequence to template alignment even when sequence identity is below 30%. this procedure is based on the notion of "cluster", a set of sequences retrieved as connected components of a graph where two proteins are linked together when they share a sequence identity greater or equal than 40% in at least 90% of the pair wise alignment length. by restricting our analysis to clusters containing human sequences and magnesium binding pdb structures, we align with the cluster hmms some  <dig>  human sequences that fall in the same clusters and inherit by this the magnesium binding feature. some  <dig> human sequences share an identity to the template less than 30%.

we therefore prove feasible that magnesium binding sites can be inherited from a given template when the sequence falls inside a well annotated cluster from where it derives also validated pfam functional domains and go functional terms. presently we can annotate some 5% of the human genome as inheriting the capability of binding magnesium ions. all the analysed sequences, their binding sites, and the corresponding clusters from where they derive annotation are included in the human magnesome data set , freely available at http://bar.biocomp.unibo.it/mg.
