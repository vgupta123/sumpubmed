BACKGROUND
at  <dig>  days of development  the mouse egg cylinder appears radially symmetrical about its proximo-distal axis with respect to known molecular markers and to the arrangement of its three principle tissue layers – epiblast, extra-embryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm. however, shortly after e <dig>  the first molecular asymmetries that determine the anterior-posterior axis begin to emerge. these involve movement of a subset of visceral endoderm cells, anterior visceral endoderm , located at the distal tip of the egg cylinder towards the future anterior side  <cit> . subsequent to this, molecular markers with a previously radial distribution near the embryonic-extra-embryonic boundary become restricted to the future posterior side at the site of the emerging primitive streak  <cit> . in this way the proximo-distal signaling anticipates the anterior-posterior patterning  <cit> . patterning thus occurs through a combination of tissue interactions and cell movements .

the stages of mouse development between implantation and the gastrulating egg cylinder have been relatively little studied. this is due partly to the relative inaccessibility of embryos within the uterine deciduae during this time, and partly to their relatively poor development in culture compared with preimplantation and gastrula stages. more recently, much attention has been focused on the events preceding gastrulation and their relation to earlier preimplantation development, providing an incentive to identify novel genes with restricted expression patterns during these stages.

several recent microarray screens have focused on stage-specific expression in pre-implantation embryos  <cit> , whilst other screening strategies have targeted specific tissues of post-implantation embryos  <cit> . in an effort to identify new genes that are differentially expressed along the proximo-distal axis and may have roles in early pre-gastrula patterning events, we employed microarray analysis to compare gene expression between proximal and distal halves of the e <dig>  egg cylinder. the proximal half includes extraembryonic ectoderm and the proximal portion of the visceral endoderm, while, the distal half includes the epiblast and the distal portion of the visceral endoderm. after secondary screening by in situ hybridisation, we identified both known and novel genes with previously unreported differential expression in the early mouse egg cylinder.

RESULTS
we compared gene expression between the proximal and distal halves of the e <dig>  egg cylinder by microarray analysis to identify genes with previously unreported differential expression at this stage of development. a scatter plot of expression levels in proximal and distal segments reveals a large number of genes that putatively show such differential expression . several genes with previously reported differential expression in the egg cylinder showed relative hybridisation levels consistent with such expression patterns. these included otx <dig>  <cit> , cripto  <cit> , dnmt3b  <cit>  and oct <dig>  <cit>  distally, and gjb <dig>  <cit> , pem  <cit> , igf <dig>  <cit>  and h <dig>  <cit>  proximally. we therefore wished to test whether other previously uncharacterised genes were also differentially expressed. we selected  <dig> genes, partly on the basis of differential and absolute levels of hybridisation in the microarray and partly on their likely involvement in developmental pathways, and further screened these genes by in situ hybridisation. of these, we successfully identified  <dig> genes with previously unreported differential expression at e <dig>  and e <dig> , while the remainder showed either undetectable or ubiquitous expression. the  <dig> genes and their expression patterns are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and summarised in table  <dig>  in situ hybridisation was extended to later stages from e <dig>  to e <dig>  for several genes, including cubilin, jarid1b, sfmbt <dig>  ndrg <dig>  talia and plet <dig>  however no tissue specific-expression within embryonic tissues was identified for any of these gene later than e <dig>  , aside from continued extraembryonic expression for cubilin, sfmbt <dig>  ndrg <dig>  and plet <dig> 

expression patterns fell into several broad categories. peg <dig>  ctsz and cubilin were expressed in the visceral endoderm mainly within the proximal or "extraembryonic" part of the egg cylinder. the expression of cubilin also extended into the distal portion of the egg cylinder in the form of two lateral "wings" overlying the epiblast. tissue sectioning showed that this expression corresponds to the distal extent of cuboidal visceral endoderm cells .

jarid1b  was expressed strongly in the epiblast at e <dig>  but more weakly and ubiquitously at e <dig>   and later stages . rt-pcr suggested a higher level of expression in whole e <dig>  embryos than in adult tissues, with the exception of strong expression in the brain .

two genes, and gjb <dig> and sfmbt <dig>  were expressed throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm. in sectioned embryos, sfmbt <dig> expression appeared uniform within the chorionic ectoderm and also within the ectoplacental cone until at least e <dig>  . sfmbt <dig> expression was also detected in all adult tissues tested but was substantially stronger in brain, lung and spleen compared with heart, kidney and liver .

ndrg <dig> was expressed uniformly throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm but more strongly within the labyrinth of the ectoplacental cone in all stages examined . at e <dig>  and e <dig>  , expression was also present in the node, while becoming weaker within the chorionic ectoderm. no specific expression in other embryonic tissues was detected later at either e <dig>  or e <dig>  .

plet <dig> was also specifically expressed in the extraembryonic ectoderm, but restricted to its distal-most part as early as e <dig>  as well as a separate domain of much stronger expression within the ectoplacental cone. the distally-restricted expression persisted, but becoming weaker and restricted to the peripheral chorion, until at least e <dig>  . expression was also detected within the ventral layer of the node .

talia
a previously undescribed gene corresponding to clone h3001d07- <dig> was also uniformly expressed in the extraembryonic ectoderm at e <dig> , and by e <dig>  was also restricted to its more distal part, adjacent to the epiblast. although levels appeared lower at later stages, expression appeared to be strongest around the perimeter of the distal part of the chorionic ectoderm at e <dig>  . expression was detected ubiquitously in all adult tissues examined by rt-pcr .

a blast search of genomic databases identified the gene as mapping to region xa <dig> of the murine x-chromosome. a human orthologue was also identified in the syntenic region xq <dig> of the human x-chromosome and in the marsupial monodelphis domestica by sequence database searches, indicating that the gene is conserved in mammals. the 5'-most part of the predicted transcript also showed homology to another previously described human gene, xe <dig>  which maps to xp <dig>  of the x-chromosome and was originally identified as a pseudoautosomal gene that escapes x inactivation  <cit>  and encodes a cell surface glycoprotein expressed in trophoblast and lymphocytes  <cit> . the murine gene represented by clone h3001d07- <dig> we thus named talia  to reflect its belt-like expression pattern in the distal part of the extraembryonic ectoderm.

sequence analysis of talia and xe7
analysis of genomic sequence data and ests revealed  <dig> exons for murine talia with a predicted mrna length of  <dig> nucleotides . promoter prediction software  <cit>  indicated an additional promoter and transcription initiation site within the 5' part of exon  <dig>  suggesting alternative primary transcripts. however probes specific for sequences either 5' or 3' of this position showed indistinguishable expression patterns by in situ hybridisation , suggesting that either the latter putative promoter is non-functional or that both are functional but share common regulatory mechanisms.

talia and xe <dig> showed homology between exons 3– <dig> of murine talia and exons 2– <dig> of human xe <dig> . blast searches revealed numerous ests derived from various tissue sources that were concluded to represent murine xe <dig>  despite its apparent absence from current genomic databases. blast searches also identified ests representing genes with homology to this conserved region at the amino acid level from each of a broad range of metazoans, including gallus gallus, xenopus spp., danio rerio, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans and hydra magnipapillata, suggesting a highly conserved function for this gene among metazoans. alignment of sequences indicated amino acid conservation was maximal within the region corresponding to exon  <dig> of talia .

talia/talia appears to be specific to mammals, being more divergent than xe <dig> from homologues in other metazoans, and apparently represents the only conserved evolutionary duplication of the ancestral gene detectable in genomic databases. functional orthologues of talia in pig and rat are supported by est evidence, however human talia is apparently not expressed, as no corresponding ests were identified in existing databases. furthermore, the human genomic sequence  contains two premature in-frame stop codons , suggesting that it is non-functional. conversely, many more ests for human xe <dig> appeared to be present in databases compared with those for murine xe <dig>  raising the possibility that mammalian xe <dig> and talia have overlapping roles and may variously substitute for one another in different species.

voland et al.  <cit>  identified several potential functional motifs within xe <dig>  including a putative leucine zipper domain, transmembrane domain and n-glycolsylation sites. however these motifs are not conserved in either talia or xe <dig> from different species. moreover, comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of talia and xe <dig> with protein databases revealed a significant similarity within the conserved region to the first two tandem rna recognition motifs  of hu proteins, which bind to adenosine-uridine-rich elements  in the 3' untranslated regions of mrnas  <cit> . the predicted secondary structure of this region of talia is similar to the known secondary structure of hud , which consists of a β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β <dig> topology within each rrm  <cit> . however, the residues of hud that were shown to interact with are sequences are not conserved in talia or xe <dig>  suggesting that they interact with different target sequences.

discussion
this study identified a number of genes with previously unreported differential expression in the early postimplantation mouse embryo. several represent new candidates for genes involved in tissue interactions controlling early events upon implantation. three genes identified in the screen – peg <dig>  ctsz and cubilin – showed specific expression in the visceral endoderm of the egg cylinder. the human orthologue of peg <dig> was originally identified as a paternally expressed imprinted gene with homologies in two open reading frames to gag and pol proteins of some vertebrate retrotransposons  <cit> . it forms part of a novel imprinted gene cluster on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and has been shown to have oncogenic activity in hepatoma cells, suggesting a role in cell proliferation  <cit> . cathepsin z, encoded by ctsz, is a member of the c <dig> family of cysteine proteases of unknown function. the gene lies proximal to a cluster of imprinted genes but is not itself imprinted  <cit> . previously, ctsz was reported as ubiquitously expressed in adult tissues  <cit> . this study, however, shows that ctsz has tissue-specific expression at least in the early post-implantation embryo.

cubilin encodes a multiligand endocytic receptor involved in uptake of low density lipoproteins and is present in absorptive epithelia of the ileum, kidney and visceral yolk sac . its lateral endodermal expression overlying the epiblast at both e <dig>  and e <dig>  is of interest as it may reflect the movements of this tissue during early gastrulation . while no antero-posterior asymmetry was evident in the expression of cubilin alone, it would be interesting to investigate the degree to which it overlaps with ave markers such as lefty <dig>  <cit> , cer <dig>  <cit>  and particularly dkk <dig>  which is expressed in the more proximal part of the embryonic ve from e <dig>  and of the later ave  <cit> .

jarid1b showed expression in epiblast and the outer part of the ectoplacental cone at e <dig> , however by e <dig>  epiblast expression was weak or undetectable. jarid1b encodes a nuclear protein that was originally identified in human breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . in normal adult tissues of human and mouse, expression is largely restricted to testis and ovary  <cit> . in e <dig> - <dig>  mouse embryos, expression occurs in a spatially restricted pattern that overlaps with those of bf- <dig> and pax- <dig>  <cit> , with which plu- <dig> has been shown to interact  <cit> .

three genes – ndrg <dig>  sfmbt <dig> and gjb <dig> – identified in the screen showed specific expression throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm at both e <dig>  and e <dig> . ndrg <dig> was originally identified by its upregulation in n-myc deficient mice  <cit> . while its precise function remains obscure, it has been reported to be involved in cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . sfmbt <dig> is related to the drosophila polycomb group of transcriptional repressors, which regulate homeotic and other genes  <cit> . the closely related murine gene sfmbt <dig>  was shown to be highly expressed in adult testis, with a much lower expression in other adult and late embryonic tissues  <cit> . sfmbt <dig> has not been characterised, however database searches of matching ests indicate expression in testis and germ cells, suggesting that sfmbt <dig> and sfmbt <dig> may have related roles.gjb <dig>  which showed very strong specific expression in the extra-embryonic ectoderm, encodes one of a large family of gap junction proteins. a number of other gap junction proteins also show spatially restricted expression during early post-implantation development, indicative of a role in establishing communication compartments  <cit> , whilst gjb <dig> expression has previously been shown in preimplantation embryos  <cit> . while the roles of gap junctions during early development remain unclear, it is possible they may help to facilitate the transduction of signalling molecules within tissues.

two genes – plet <dig> and talia – showed localised expression in the extraembryonic ectoderm that may suggest a role in the interactions between epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm. signals from this region of the egg cylinder are believed to regulate proximo-distal patterning of the epiblast via such factors as nodal, cripto and otx <dig>  <cit> . proximo-distal signaling contributes to anterior-posterior patterning via asymmetric cell movements that position the ave opposite the site of primitive streak formation. the specific identity of extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the epiblast is thought to be regulated by fgf <dig> signaling via activation of the erk pathway . thus it is likely that expression of plet <dig> and talia is regulated downstream of this signaling, and may have roles in specifying this identity. in particular, the restricted expression of plet <dig> from e <dig>  appears to be earlier than has been reported for other genes such as eomes  <cit>  and bmp <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that plet <dig> expression may be directly regulated by this pathway. recently identified by its trophoblast-specific expression at later stages of mouse, pig and human  <cit> , no functional motifs are evident to suggest a role for the protein.

by contrast, we have shown from its predicted tertiary structure that talia is likely to function as a post-transcriptional regulator due to its similarities with hud, an rna-binding protein shown to have a role in specifying neural cell identity  <cit> . interestingly the role of talia is possibly substituted by a homologue, xe <dig>  in humans. the high conservation of orthologues of talia/xe <dig> amongst metazoans further supports an essential role in development.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated for the first time the application of a microarray strategy for identifying genes that are differentially expressed between dissected parts of the early post-implantation mouse embryo. it successfully identified several genes, both known and previously uncharacterised, with novel expression patterns in the early mouse post-implantation embryo. some of these, such as talia and plet <dig>  will be of particular interest for further analysis, particularly with respect to possible roles in specifying the identity of extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the epiblast or in signaling to the proximal epiblast.
