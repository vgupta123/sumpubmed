BACKGROUND
the system of figs and fig wasps is considered to be a classic example of coevolved mutualism. it is well known that in general each fig species has a unique pollinator, which is called the "one-to-one" rule. however, more and more examples of co-pollinators  have broken the "one-to-one" rule  <cit> . however, we do not yet know how they evolve. they might be distantly related species, suggesting host shifts, or sister species, suggesting speciation on the current host  <cit> . host shifts might be more likely when a fig colonises a new habitat, or is near the edge of its geographic range, because the normal pollinator is rare or absent. in this scenario, the co-pollinators are usually not closely related species  <cit> . alternatively, sister co-pollinators may evolve from a recent speciation event in the pollinator that is not accompanied by fig radiation  <cit> . however, the exact mode of speciation for co-pollinators has not been well understood yet.

wolbachia bacteria are the most common intracellular bacteria in arthropods and nematodes, and can manipulate host reproduction in many ways  <cit> . cytoplasmic incompatibility , the most common effect on host reproduction, usually occurs between infected males and uninfected females , inducing progeny sterility or mortality  <cit> . this post-zygotic reproductive isolation can potentially cause or facilitate host speciation  <cit> . fig wasp species have a very high incidence of wolbachia infection  <cit> , and previous work suggests that wolbachia might have an influence on fig wasp speciation, because cryptic pollinator species have different wolbachia infections  <cit> . so, wolbachia may play a potential important role in co-pollinator speciation.

in addition, wolbachia can influence host mitochondrial dna evolution. because wolbachia and mitochondria are co-transmitted maternally, the spread of wolbachia can result in the hitchhiking of mitochondrial haplotypes. one particular mitochondrial haplotype can sweep through a population, via hitchhiking, associated with the sweep of wolbachia  <cit> . this affects mtdna evolution by decreasing mitochondrial haplotype diversity and also sometimes the mtdna divergence between species  <cit> , and thus can confound phylogenies and barcodes based on host mtdna  <cit> . accordingly, we look forward to understanding the effect of wolbachia on mtdna evolution of fig wasps.

ficus microcarpa linn. is a functionally monoecious fig species. it is pollinated solely by eupristina verticillata waterston  <cit> . here, we investigate the genetic variance and wolbachia infection status of eupristina verticillata in order to explore whether co-pollinators exist, the association between wolbachia infection and co-pollinators speciation, and the effect of wolbachia on host mtdna evolution.

RESULTS
morphological study
we extracted dna from the specimens non-destructively, so the specimens can be conserved as vouchers for morphological study. according to the keys of bouƒçek and wiebes  <cit> , all the specimens are morphologically identified as eupristina verticillata.

wolbachia infection
after initial screening for wolbachia infection, we selected  <dig> pollinator specimens  for further research. only one specimen is infected by two wolbachia strains, while the other  <dig> specimens are infected by a single strain .

* a line means no wolbachia.

in view of the nj-tree based on wsp sequences and the divergence among wsp haplotypes , we recognise three wolbachia strains . the divergence between wev <dig> and wev <dig> is much smaller  than that between wev <dig> and wev <dig> , and between wev <dig> and wev <dig> .we then searched for similar wsp sequences on the ncbi database. the results show that wev <dig> and wev <dig> are 97-100% similar to the wsp sequences found in e. verticillata in australia-asia  <cit> , whereas wev <dig> is similar to a great number of wsp sequences found in many other insects, including other fig wasps, gall wasps, mosquitoes, bugs, fruit flies and so on.

phylogeny and molecular variance
we obtain coi and its <dig> sequences for all  <dig> pollinator specimens. there are  <dig> unique coi haplotypes of 652bp in length, of which  <dig> nucleotide sites are polymorphic and  <dig> are parsimony informative. the nj-tree based on coi sequences  shows that all the specimens cluster into  <dig> distinct clades with high bootstrap values. we name them as clade  <dig>  clade  <dig> and clade  <dig>  the mean coi genetic divergence within each clade is tiny , while the mean divergence among the clades is large  enough to suggest different species.

we also obtain  <dig> its <dig> sequences, whose length vary from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. the nj-tree based on its <dig> sequences  also shows three distinct clades . the sequences within each clade are nearly or absolutely identical. the divergence among the clades, due mostly to length variance, is  <dig> % between clade i and ii,  <dig> % between clade ii and iii, and  <dig> % between clade i and iii. remarkably, the nj-trees based on coi and its <dig> sequences have very similar topologies, and the members which cluster together in coi clades also cluster together in its <dig> clades .

distribution of pollinators
a summary of e. verticillata samples and their genetic characteristics is shown in table  <dig>  all samples from haikou, sanya, wanning, wuping fall into clade  <dig> and those from danzhou and wenchang belong to clade  <dig> and clade  <dig>  respectively. for xidao, lingshui and baisha, individuals of clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> coexist.

mitochondrial dna polymorphism and evolution pattern
we mapped the status of wolbachia infection onto the e. verticillata clades based on coi sequences. this reveals very strong concordance between e. verticillata clades and wolbachia infection status. clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> mainly harbour wev <dig> and wev <dig>  respectively, while clade  <dig> specimens are free from wolbachia infection . in order to examine the effect of wolbachia on host mitochondrial dna, we compared patterns of mitochondrial dna polymorphism and evolution among the clades. the results are shown in table  <dig> 

n = no. of fig wasps samples; h = no. of mitochondrial dna haplotype; hd = haplotype diversity; s = no. of segregating sites; pi = nucleotide diversity; d = genetic divergence. *: p <  <dig> ;**: p <  <dig> ;***: p <  <dig> .

the mean genetic divergence , haplotype diversity  and nucleotide diversity  among the three clades are significantly different. they are all much lower in clade  <dig> and  <dig> than in clade  <dig>  in addition, we could reject neutral evolution for clade  <dig> and  <dig> with neutrality values  significantly less than zero, but not for clade  <dig>  in summary, we detect predicted effects of wolbachia infection on both mtdna diversity and evolution.

discussion
cryptic co-pollinators
in this research, data from both mitochondrial  and nuclear  markers indicate that e. verticillata wasps fall into three distinct species . coi divergence among these clades is large  enough to suggest that these are different species. coi is the gene used for animal dna barcoding and has the potential to facilitate both the identification of known species and the discovery of new ones  <cit> . hebert et al.  studied the ability of coi to distinguish  <dig> species across  <dig> animal phyla, and the result revealed that more than 98% of species pairs showed greater than 2% sequence divergence  <cit> . in this study, the coi divergence is greater than 2%, so it suggests the existence of cryptic species within the morphologically defined e. verticillata. however, because wolbachia can confound dna barcoding based on mtdna, we need nuclear markers to support the conclusion from the analysis of mtdna. nuclear marker its <dig> sequences, which are not affected by wolbachia, also support the conclusion of cryptic species. its <dig> has been studied in other hymenopterans, and this nuclear dna fragment shows high conservation within species and high divergence between congeneric species  <cit> . in our study, its <dig> sequences within each clade are nearly identical but diverge considerably among clades . therefore, according to the tree topologies and the divergence of coi and its <dig>  we define the specimens in clade  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as e. verticillata- <dig>  e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> 

how can cryptic co-pollinators occur?
as background mentioned, co-pollinators may occur as a result of host shift or speciation. in south china, f. microcarpa is widespread, so host shift event seems unlikely. in addition, survey of fig wasps in hainan and other provinces in south china does not reveal that e. verticillata exists on other host figs . all the above information suggests that occurrence of co-pollinators on f. microcarpa is unlikely to be due to host shift.

alternatively, co-pollinators may evolve from a recent speciation event in the pollinator that is not accompanied by fig radiation  <cit> . in this circumstance, the co-pollinators are likely to be sister or close related species  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis indicates that the three species we found are not only cryptic species, but also closely related species . based on the commonly used mitochondrial dna clock rate of  <dig> % pairwise divergence/myr  <cit> , e. verticillata- <dig> diverged from e. verticillata- <dig> about  <dig>  million years ago, and e. verticillata- <dig> diverged from e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> about  <dig>  million years ago. although e. verticillata- <dig> seems distant from the other two species particularly based on its <dig> sequences, in view of the phylogeny and identical morphology, we still expect that the three species share the same ancestor. together with the evidence that in some locations , e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> occur on the same tree, we conclude that e. verticillata has diverged into three species on the same host. this pattern might be attributed to the comparatively longer generation time of figs compared to that of wasps  <cit> .

new species often arise via geographic isolation, but the current geographic distributions of the three species do not suggest geographic isolation . in some locations, e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> coexist. e. verticillata- <dig> is only found in wenchang, but this phenomenon might only reflect low sampling to date. additionally, speciation may also be driven by wolbachia-induced reproductive incompatibility. previous studies have indicated that wolbachia can induce reproductive incompatibility, and then facilitate host speciation  <cit> . in this study, we note that the three species have different wolbachia infection status. e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> are infected by closely related wolbachia strains, wev <dig> and wev <dig>  while e. verticillata- <dig> is uninfected. a blast search for similar wsp sequences on the ncbi database indicates that wev <dig> and wev <dig> are specifically related to e. verticillata. the strong correlation between phylogenetic trees of wasp species and wolbachia strains suggests that wolbachia may be involved in the divergence and speciation of hosts. in addition, we calculated the time when wev <dig> and wev <dig> diverged based on the wsp divergence rate   <cit> . the divergence between wev <dig> and wev <dig> occurred about  <dig> mya, earlier than the host wasp divergence. this makes it possible that wev <dig> and wev <dig> play a role in host speciation. although our results show that wev <dig> and wev <dig> may be involved in host speciation, we can not demonstrate that wolbachia cause reproductive isolation among these three host species. so, the exact mode of speciation for three e. verticillata still needs to be explored.

effect of wolbachia on host mitochondrial dna polymorphism and evolution pattern
many explanations have been proposed for lower mitochondrial dna polymorphism and deviation from neutral evolution, including population expansion from a bottleneck  <cit> , selective sweep  <cit>  and selection against weakly deleterious mutations  <cit> . we analyse the population size change by dnasp, and get no evidence for population expansion   <cit> . therefore, we should consider the other two possibilities. it is notable that e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> are infected by wolbachia and show lower mitochondrial dna polymorphism than uninfected e. verticillata- <dig>  the perfect concordance of mitochondrial dna polymorphism and wolbachia infection status suggests that wolbachia-associated selective sweeps of the mitochondrion have occurred in e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig>  decreased mitochondrial dna polymorphism as a consequence of wolbachia infection has also been reported in several other insects  <cit> . we also find that the coi genes of e. verticillata- <dig> and e. verticillata- <dig> deviate significantly from neutral evolution while this is not so for e. verticillata- <dig>  therefore, this is also likely due to an mtdna sweep associated with the spread of wolbachia, making the mtdna undergo purifying selection. in addition, a selection against the weakly deleterious mutation may also induce lower mitochondrial dna polymorphism and deviation from neutral evolution, and it needs to be explored further.

CONCLUSIONS
our study reveals the molecular variance within e. verticillata, and indicates the presence of cryptic species. further analyses suggest that the occurrence of cryptic species is attributable to successive speciation. a survey on the wolbachia infection in e. verticillata points to a strong correlation between wolbachia strains and the pollinator species, which may indicate an important role of wolbachia in the formation of the cryptic species. our study also reveals that wolbachia strains infecting e. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on host mitochondrial dna.
