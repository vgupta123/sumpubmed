BACKGROUND
baculoviruses are arthropod-specific viruses containing large double-stranded circular dna genomes of 80000- <dig> bps. a characteristic of these viruses is the presence of two different phenotypes during virus infection: budded virus  in the initial part of multiplication cycle and occlusion bodies  at the end of replication  <cit> . in nature, primary infection takes place in the insect midgut cells after ingestion of obs, and then the initial progeny of bvs is responsible for systemic infection  <cit> . finally, the obs are produced during the last phase of cycle and comprise virions embedded in a protein matrix that protects the viruses in the environment  <cit> . baculoviruses have been used extensively in many biological applications such as protein expression systems, as models of genetic regulatory networks and genome evolution, as putative non-human viral vectors for gene delivery, and as biological control agents against insect pests  <cit> . in particular, the anticarsia gemmatalis multinucleopolyhedrovirus  was studied thirty years ago and it is suggested as the most successful example of baculovirus applied as bioinsecticide  <cit> . agmnpv is used to control the velvet bean caterpillar anticarsia gemmatalis hübner , one of the most important insect pests of soybean crops in america  <cit> .

usually, the easiest way to replicate baculoviruses is by infection of susceptible larvae colonies. however, it is possible to produce baculoviruses in vitro in a more simple way due to the selection of insect cell lines, taking into account current limitations such as the accumulation of point mutations in the fp25k locus conducting to a reduction in the yields of polyhedra  <cit> . the cell line ufl-ag- <dig> from embryos of anticarsia gemmatalis was established to produce agmnpv in laboratory conditions  <cit> . nevertheless, viral production levels are not always suitable to baculovirus applications, forcing the use of alternative strategies that involve the use of methods for viral concentration, which increases costs and production times. this situation stimulates the development of new methods oriented to improve the process of infection in cellular cultures to reach better viral yields. thus, the production of agmnpv in ufl-ag- <dig> cells could be favored, for example, doing the infection in a specific cell cycle stage. however, there is little information about cycle synchronization in insect cell lines. it was described that spodoptera frugiperda  cells are affected when treated with conditioned medium; and it was observed that they are arrested in g2/m cell stage by acmnpv infection generating implications in cell proliferation and recombinant protein production  <cit> . the same authors were also evaluated the effects of synchronization in trichoplusia ni  insect cell using similar tests  <cit> . on the other hand, there are standardized protocols for synchronization in mammalian cells, such as those based on serum deprivation, contact inhibition or chemical treatments  <cit> . serum deprivation is used widely for synchronizing cells by arresting them in g0/g <dig> phase, but it often reduces cell survival and increases dna fragmentation  <cit> .

taking into account the cited antecedents, this work describes the optimization of a synchronization process by serum deprivation in ufl-ag- <dig> cells and its impact on the productivity of agmnpv.

RESULTS
fbs deprivation and cellular growth
in order to obtain synchronized cultures of anticarsia gemmatalis  cells, different growth conditions in grace's medium with decreasing amounts of fbs were tested, because it was reported that the deprivation of this component allows arrest of cell cultures into g0/g <dig> cell cycle state  <cit> . first, with the goal to select the lowest concentration of fbs that did not affect cell survival, the total number of ufl-ag- <dig> cells after incubation for  <dig> h in four different culture conditions  were tested .

the results indicated that cell culture media containing both  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of fbs caused an unacceptable decrease of the cellular viability, while the treatment with  <dig> % fbs allowed to arrest the cell growth and preserve the initial viability . it should be noted that cells growing in standard conditions  showed typical behavior of cell multiplication , which is in agreement with previous literature  <cit> . according to the above, the culture condition of 1% fbs in grace's medium was chosen to continue with the trials in comparison with the standard growing condition . lower concentrations of fbs  caused a significant decrease in cellular quantity after  <dig> h of treatment, condition that could induce dna fragmentation and subsequent cell death  <cit> .

cell stages and actin cytoskeleton
cells growing with 1% fbs or 10% fbs during  <dig> h were studied by flow cytometer experiments in order to obtain a quantitative determination of cell stage subpopulations. the analysis of in vitro cell cultures in active replication state can be achieved by nucleic acid fluorescence labeling and then analyzing the fluorescence properties of each cell in the whole population. quiescent and g <dig> cells have one unit of nuclear genome and will therefore have 1× fluorescence intensity. on the other hand, cells in phase g2/m have two units of nuclear genome and thus have a 2× fluorescence intensity; whereas s phase cells, that are synthesizing dna, have values of fluorescence intensity intermediate between 1× and 2× . according to this, it was found that after carrying out the deprivation process with 1% fbs in grace's medium during  <dig> h 90% of ufl-ag- <dig> cells were in g0/g <dig>  3% in s, and 7% in g2/m, yielding similar results than those obtained in mammal cells  <cit> . meanwhile, actively growing cells showed only 69% of the population in g0/g <dig>  6% in s and 25% in g2/m.

also, to support that the ufl-ag- <dig> cells could be synchronized by serum deprivation in the g0/g <dig> phase, stains of nucleus  were done. thus, the images obtained showed nuclei with different morphologies, mitotic events, and evidence of cellular division in cells growing in standard condition. otherwise, the images for the fbs starved cells showed a more homogenous behavior, with the nuclei in an expanded morphology suggesting a non-mitotic cell cycle state according with flow cytometer results . moreover, in order to analyze the actin cytoskeleton a specific probe of actin polymers  was tested in cells growing in both culture conditions . in this way, captured images showed that ufl-ag- <dig> cells under standard conditions of growth revealed arrangements of actin, a typical feature of cells in active division. in contrast, serum deprived cells showed mainly diffuse cytoplasm fluorescence, suggesting that cellular actin was in a non-polymerized topology, with just the presence of actin microfilaments associated to the plasma membrane like filopodia.

baculovirus production
once synchronized ufl-ag- <dig> cells were in g0/g <dig> stage, the productivity of baculovirus infections was tested. first, the virus genome production in bvs was measured. ufl-ag- <dig> monolayers, synchronized and non-synchronized, were exposed to agmnpv-sf  and then incubated in grace's medium containing 10% fbs during  <dig> h. the quantitation of viral dna recovered from bvs from both culture conditions showed that synchronized cells produced  <dig>  more viral dna than non previously fbs deprived cells. besides, the integrity of genome was confirmed by rflp assays using hindiii and ecori enzymes. an identical pattern of fragments was obtained in both cases .

keeping in mind that the increment in the amount of dna suggests an increase in the quantity of virions and it should be accompanied by an increment in the viral transcription activity, an mrna analysis was done. to carry out this, a set of ufl-ag- <dig> monolayers previously synchronized by fbs deprivation or growing in standard conditions were exposed to agmnpv-sf . first, the mrna levels of ie <dig>  gp <dig> and polh genes  were analyzed with respect to the mrna level of the cellular actin gene by hybridization with specific probes. actin mrna was used as reference in transcript analysis because actin is one of the housekeeping genes more frequently employed in this kind of studies, together with alpha-tubuline or elongation factor  <dig> alpha genes  <cit> . because there are no sequence information about anticarsia gemmatalis, except for a fragment of actin gene   <cit> , that sequence was used as an internal standard in mrna assays. taking into account that actin transcription could have affected by baculovirus infection processes, the quantity of actin mrna was estimated along the time period considered in the assays . thus, no significant changes in actin transcription level were observed. in function of this, whole rnas from infected ufl-ag- <dig> cultures in each condition at the three assayed mois and in three different times of cycle  were isolated. then, the relative amounts of each considered gene were tested by slot blot hybridization and densitometry analysis .

the transcript analyses showed that synchronized ufl-ag- <dig> cells produced  <dig> to  <dig> times more specific transcripts than non-synchronized cells. the ie <dig> gene, dependent on cellular rna polymerase ii, was that achieved highest levels of transcription in synchronized cells , whereas gp <dig> and polh show lowest comparative values probably due to the partial or complete dependency of the viral transcription machinery. it is noteworthy that in the shorter times the behavior was more variable. even when a synchronized cell culture was used, infections at moi's  <dig> or less introduce high variability in the repetitions because the efficiency of primary infection follows a stochastic behavior. this possible effect would become more marked when the observation time was very short , period in which bvs have not been generated yet and, therefore, the subsequent infections of neighboring cells are not feasible. secondary infections tend to normalize the situation, leading to infect all cells. however, when the initial moi was  <dig>  synchronized infection could be assumed, where all susceptible cells could be subject to primo-infection, and initial bvs could not significantly alter the results given the absence of available cells for secondary infection. in spite of these considerations, the fact that the method sensitivity could have affected the obtained results should not be discarded.

the previous results should be correlated with differences in the production of bvs and obs. in order to test this, agmnpv bvs and obs were isolated from infected ufl-ag- <dig> monolayers , previously synchronized or non-synchronized. bvs were quantified by titration assays and obs were quantified by microscopic count .

according to obtained data, an increase in agmnpv productivity was achieved both in bv and ob phenotypes when cells were previously arrested in g0/g <dig> stage. thus, the agmnpv infection of synchronized cell cultures produced  <dig>   times of bvs and  <dig>   times of obs  respect to the same assay using cells growing in standard conditions. the increase in virus production was expected because the infection occurs better when cells are in g <dig> stage  <cit> . however, of the non synchronized cells 69% exhibited the g0/g <dig> stage. this could be due to differences in cytoskeleton polymerization/depolymerization induced by the same treatment. processes of infection at the g <dig> cell stage cause a brief delay in the onset of immediate early virus transcription, while those that occur at other times of cell cycle produce a longer lag phase , because baculoviruses promote cell arrest in g <dig> in order to better exploit the cell machinery in its own multiplication  <cit> . another factor that may contribute in increasing the transcription levels and viral production in cells synchronized is the availability of g-actin, because the actin monomers function as transcriptional activators as part of complexes formed by rnapol ii and promoter sequences  <cit> . in fact, there were few actin filaments when ufl-ag- <dig> cells were synchronized by serum deprivation, being instead primarily as g-actin. thus, there would be many more transcription activator complexes and, therefore, a bigger transcriptional activity would be reached  <cit> . otherwise, the differences in the achieved increases in the yield of budded and occluded phenotypes between the two conditions tested can be related to the limiting factor given by the accumulation of late and very late proteins in the infected cells. this implies a deep redirection of the cellular biochemical machinery and has a completely requirement of the viral transcriptional machinery.

in addition, and taking into account that it is unknown if the molecular context of the cells is totally homogeneous it should be considered that there were also other modified cellular factors that could have collaborated with the obtained yields.

CONCLUSIONS
baculoviruses are useful tools for various biological applications, such as heterologous protein expression, as bioinsecticides against agricultural lepidopteran pests or as gene delivery vectors in mammals, among other potential uses  <cit> . for any of these applications is necessary to produce large quantities of viruses, which can be generated in vivo using the natural host insect larvae by per os infection with obs; or in vitro, using cell lines derived from the same hosts, by infection with bvs. in any case, it is important to optimize production strategies in order to obtain the highest yields of baculoviruses. in particular, we are interested in agmnpv, the most used baculovirus for biological control of agricultural pests  <cit> .

this study has shown that insect cell cultures can be synchronized by serum deprivation, and thereby ensuring that most of them are in g0/g <dig> stage. thus, this cellular sub-phase would be the most susceptible to infection. moreover, the reduction of actin cytoskeleton and high availability of g-actin would have a positive impact both for the transport of nucleocapsids to the nucleus, and enhancing the transcription of early viral genes.

these results show that the fbs deprivation treatment on ufl-ag- <dig> cells during  <dig> h prior to the infection had a high impact in agmnpv yields. in conclusion, this method has proven to be useful for increasing the production of agmnpv in ufl-ag- <dig> cells, and also has provided evidence about the influence of host cell phenotype respect to its susceptibility to replicate baculoviruses.
