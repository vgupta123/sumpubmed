BACKGROUND
the acute phase response is an unspecific systemic reaction of the organism that occurs after infection or inflammation  <cit> . this reaction includes changes in the concentrations of some plasma proteins called acute phase proteins   <cit> . changes of app concentration in pigs serum have been extensively investigated during last years 2– <dig> but, to the best of our knowledge, no studies related to the app behavior following influenza virus and pasteurella multocida  coinfection has been reported.

respiratory diseases in pigs are often considered as multifactorial problems caused by various pathogens  in combination. the most common infectious agent responsible for respiratory infection in pigs are: swine influenza virus , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , pasteurella multocida , actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  <cit> . these pathogens may act together to increase the severity and duration of the disease. in pigs, as well as in humans, bacterial pneumonia secondary to influenza is often observed  <cit>  and siv is an important contributor to the porcine respiratory disease complex . the bacterial pathogens associated with prdc are classified as primary or secondary pathogens, and pm plays a key role as a secondary invader  <cit> . up to now the kinetics of acute phase response after experimental infection of pigs with siv or pm alone have been investigated  <cit> . exposure to multiple pathogens may result in different kinetics of app response, as compare to monoinfection with siv or pm.

in this study the immune and c-reactive protein , haptoglobin , serum amyloid a  or/and pig major acute phase protein  responses after simultaneous co-infection with common porcine pathogens: siv  and pm were evaluated in piglets. the correlation between concentration of investigated app in serum and severity of infection  were also studied, to estimate the utility of app measurement in the evaluation of pigs health status.

RESULTS
clinical signs
in all coinfected pigs clinical sings including fever, coughing, nasal discharge, dyspnea and anorexia were observed. in all infected animals the rectal temperature increased over 40°c . clinical score ranged between  <dig> and  <dig>  in the control pigs no clinical signs of any disease were seen.

pathological examination
in all inoculated pigs necropsied at  <dig> dpi atrophy of turbinates was observed  . in pigs euthanized at  <dig> or  <dig> dpi no clear macroscopic changes in the turbinates were observed.

postmortem examination revealed also macroscopic lesions in the lungs of 10/ <dig> infected pigs. the mean lung score was 30% ±  <dig> %  . there were no significant differences between lung score observed at different days post inoculation.

hematological examination
in coinfected pigs, the overall number of leukocytes increased significantly during study and ranged from  <dig>  × 109/l at  <dig> dpi to  <dig>  × 109/l at  <dig> dpi . in control pigs total number of leukocytes ranged from  <dig>  × 109/l to  <dig>  × 109/l. the number of lymphocytes remained relatively stable, while the number of granulocytes increased significantly from  <dig>  × 109/l at  <dig> dpi to  <dig>  × 109/l at  <dig> dpi  and then decreased to  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi . the mean percentages of lymphocytes were the lowest at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, and reached  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, while on day  <dig> the percentage of lymphocyte reached over 60% . in control piglets the mean concentration as well as percentage of lymphocytes remained stable and ranged from  <dig>  × 109/l to  <dig>  × 109/l and from 53% to 67%, respectively. in infected pigs a significant increase in the percentage of granulocytes was observed from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  . additionally, a significant increase of mean concentration of medium-sized  cells, from  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi to  <dig>  × 109/l,  was observed at  <dig> dpi .

humoral immune response to swh1n <dig> and pasteurella multocida dnt
all infected pigs exhibited specific antibodies against hemagglutinin from  <dig> dpi; the hi titre ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . sera from control pigs had no antibody titres . the mean level of anti-dnt ab started to increase significantly from  <dig> dpi in infected pigs as compared to controls, and tended to increase till the end of study  .
 data are geometric mean ± sd. * significant increase as compared to control animals, p <  <dig> .

presence of siv and toxigenic pm in swabs and tissues
real-time rt-pcr assay, used to confirm the presence of siv in the nasal swabs revealed positive results from all infected pigs between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. at  <dig> dpi positive results were found only in  <dig> out of  <dig> infected pigs. in the nasal swabs taken before inoculation no siv genetic material was found. in all infected pigs, euthanized at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, the presence of siv was confirmed for the trachea as well as middle lobes of the lungs. in three piglets, the occurrence of siv was also confirmed for apical and accessory lobes. no viral rna was found in diaphragmatic lobes. no viral rna was detected in lungs on day  <dig> post inoculation

the results of the bacterial isolation, identification of pm genes encoding dnt with the use of the pcr technique, and results of the real-time rt-pcr assay, used to confirm the presence of siv in samples taken from infected pigs, are given in table  <dig>  in the nasal swabs taken before inoculation, no dnt producing pm were found . with the use of standard bacteriological method the presence of pm was confirmed in  <dig> out of  <dig> swabs, while with the use of pcr in  <dig> out of  <dig> swabs, taken after coinfection.

in control pigs no genetic material of toxigenic pm and swh1n <dig> were found at any time points.

acute phase proteins
all investigated app increased significantly after coinfection, with mean maximum concentration from day  <dig> to  <dig> . in the control pigs levels of investigated app remained relatively constant.

c-reactive protein
prior to inoculation, experimental pigs had crp serum concentration below  <dig> μg/ml . twenty four hour after coinfection the mean concentration of crp reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml. significant difference, as compared to control animals, were seen between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . the maximum mean level was observed at  <dig> dpi and reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml . starting from  <dig> dpi after coinoculation, the mean concentrations of crp did not differ significantly from that observed in the control pigs .

haptoglobin
preinoculation individual levels of hp were found to be below  <dig>  mg/ml. the highest individual level after coinfection reached  <dig>  mg/ml . in all coinfected pigs the significant changes in the concentration of hp were observed during study. the mean concentration of hp had increased by  <dig> h after coinoculation and from that time-point were significantly higher as compared to control pigs . the highest mean concentrations of hp were observed at  <dig> dpi. the mean peak level was over 4-fold higher, as compared to the mean preinoculation concentration.

serum amyloid a
significant increase of saa after coinfection, as compared to the control pigs, was observed only at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . during first  <dig> h after inoculation the increases of saa concentration was not significant as compared to control pigs . the mean peak level reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml, this was almost 40-fold higher compared to day 0-level. from  <dig> dpi the saa concentration had decreased and did not differ from those observed in control animals.

pig major acute phase protein
preinoculation levels of pig-map were found to be below  <dig>  mg/ml . concentration of pig-map increased significantly  <dig> h after coinfection  and remained significantly elevated till  <dig> dpi. the highest pig-map concentrations in particular pigs were detected between  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. the maximum mean concentration of pig-map, observed at  <dig> dpi in coinfected piglets, was almost  <dig> times higher as compared to day 0-level. from  <dig> dpi the pig-map concentrations had decreased and did not differ significantly between control and infected pigs.

significant positive correlations were found between maximal concentration of hp and saa and lung scores . positive correlation was also observed between maximum concentration of pig-map in serum and turbinate score  and between clinical score and pig-map and saa maximal concentrations in the serum .

discussion
swine influenza is generally characterized by acute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms  <cit> . the most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia. pasteurella multocida is believed as a major bacterial agent that complicates swine influenza virus infections, and still remains the most common respiratory bacterium isolated in cases of prdc  <cit> . pasteurella multocida is considered to be an opportunistic invader that could be cleared from the lungs of normal pigs  <cit> , but siv-induced damage to the respiratory tract  reduced ability to clear the infection  <cit> . previous study conducted on turkey revealed that in birds infected with avian influenza virus , the numbers of pm in their respiratory tracts increased to a greater extent than in birds which had not been infected with the aiv  <cit> .

until now there have been no reports published on the kinetics of acute-phase response after coinfection of pigs with siv and pm, even though this coinfection is often found in the field conditions  <cit> . only reports dealing with analyses of app response in pigs monoinfected with pm or siv have been published to date  <cit> .

after intranasal simultaneous coinfection of pigs with swh1n <dig> and pm various kinetics of responses could be recognized within the app tested. the concentration of crp increased significantly at  <dig> dpi as compared to control pigs, and remained significantly higher to  <dig> dpi. level of saa was significantly induced from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. haptoglobin was significantly elevated from  <dig> dpi to the end of study, while pig-map from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi. the concentrations of crp, hp and saa significantly increased before specific antibodies were detected.

the significant increase in the concentration of crp, hp, saa and pig-map have been also found previously in pigs infected with pm only   <cit> . however, in pm monoinfection the concentration of crp was higher, as compared to control pigs, only at  <dig> dpi. the mean maximum concentration of crp in pm-infected pigs was lower than in coinfected piglets . in piglets infected with siv  the mean maximum concentration of crp reached only  <dig> μg/ml  <cit> .

changes in hp concentrations in present study were similar to those observed previously in pm-infected pigs  <cit> , but after coinfection with siv the response were more protracted. the mean maximal concentrations were similar. in contrast in only siv-infected pigs the level of hp in serum increased significantly only at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi and reached considerably lower value   <cit> .

serum amyloid a response in coinfected pigs was observed earlier than in pm-infected ones, but later than in siv infected piglets  <cit> . mean maximum concentration of saa in serum were higher in coinfected piglets, as compared to pm monoinfected animals . in only siv infected piglets the maximum level reached only  <dig>  μg/ml  <cit> . the response of pig-map in coinfected piglets were similar to those observed by us previously after single infection with pm  <cit> , but totally different  from those observed after siv infection  <cit> .

generally, in pm and swh1n <dig> coinfected pigs, the app response was observed earlier than in pm-infected, and the mean induction levels of most app were higher in co-infected animals . in comparison to siv- infection, the app response was much stronger and more protracted in coinfected pigs.

interactions among multiple pathogens in pigs appear to generate a more severe or chronic outcome than is observed with individual pathogens by themselves  <cit> . pulmonary lesions observed in present study were more severe when compared to singly infected animals  <cit> . it seems that siv and pm co-infection contributes to exacerbate of pulmonary lesions. there are several mechanism reported by which siv infection predisposes to secondary bacterial infection, which include: impairment of respiratory epithelial barrier, increase host expression of receptors for bacteria leading to enhance colonization, modification of host immune responses   <cit> .

earlier response of the most app after infection with siv or swh1n <dig> + pm, as compared to pm-mono infection, could be a result of shorter incubation period with regard to siv-infections and the earliest induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially il- <dig>  which are known to be a major regulator of app production by hepatocytes  <cit> . as it have been found by barbé et al.  <cit> , during siv infection il- <dig> concentration in piglets’ serum peaked from  <dig> to  <dig> h post infection. at later time-points post infection, the concentration of this cytokine was either >20-fold lower or at the limit of detection. the serum levels of other cytokines stimulating production of app by hepatocytes  were under the limit of detection. rapid disappearance of il- <dig> from serum could also explain a fast drop in app concentrations during to the preinoculation levels in only siv infected piglets  <cit> . studies conducted on mice reveled that after pm infection concentration of cytokines involved in regulation of app production by hepatocytes increased at later time-points post infection  <cit> . the concentration of il- <dig> peaked at  <dig> h post pm infection of mice and remained elevated for the longer period of time   <cit> .

in the study by francisco et al.  <cit> , a slight correlation between hp concentration in serum and extent of turbinate atrophy was found after infection with pm. our results did not confirm this finding, but we found the significant positive correlation between maximum serum pig-map concentration and degree of turbinate atrophy . it should be mentioned that the timing of sampling must be taken into consideration as it may be critical in showing a precise correlation, as was reported previously by francisco et al.  <cit> . moreover, we found positive relationships between maximal concentration of hp and saa in serum and lung scores. the significant positive correlation found between maximum concentrations of saa in serum and lung scores were also reported previously in pigs infected with h1n <dig> swine influenza virus  <cit> . similarly, positive correlation between hp and saa concentration in pigs’ serum at the day of necropsy and changes in the lungs were reported after pm infection  <cit> . furthermore, the positive association between concentration of saa and clinical score were found in present study. the positive correlation between clinical course and hp concentration in pigs serum was also previously reported by grau-roma et al.  <cit>  in pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study confirmed that monitoring of app may revealed ongoing infection, and in this way may be useful in selecting clinically healthy pigs i.e. before integration into an uninfected herd. the highest concentrations of all investigated app were observed from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, before specific antibodies in serum were present. exposure to multiple pathogens resulted in the strongest crp, hp and saa response as compared to mono-infection with siv or pm  <cit> . additional studies need to be done in order to confirm these findings with regard to other coinfections. present result also confirm our previous findings that saa could be a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies  or as a marker for disease severity, because of correlation observed between its concentration in serum and disease severity .
