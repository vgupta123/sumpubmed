BACKGROUND
it is well known that the teflon event involving the dupont company of usa drew serious international attention to perfluorooctanoic acid   <cit> ; pfoa is formed from the raw materials used in the production of teflon-lined non-stick cooking appliances. fluoropolymers such as teflon have very good performances e.g. as fire retardants and for oil and fat resistance; their byproducts such as pfoa can be formed by cooking, burning and environmental degradation. pfoa is still widely used in basic processes in the aviation, automobile, building materials, chemicals, electronic, semiconductor and textile industries. it is persistent and non-biodegradable and becomes widely distributed in nature, e.g. water  <cit> , biological bodies  <cit> , human tissues  <cit>  and foods  <cit> . it can certainly enter the gastrointestinal tract via the intake of foods and water and then it is absorbed and permeates into the blood and various tissues. sampling studies have revealed the presence of pfoa in the bloods of over 90% of us residents  <cit> . it may have serious effects on the endocrine, immune and nervous systems and it can be delivered to the fetus through the umbilical cord and can accumulate  <cit> . it can also cause cancers of the liver, testis, pancreatic and mammary glands  <cit> , and can lead to embryonic deformities and other diseases  <cit> . in recent years, pfoa has become a significant issue in many aspects of environmental ecology, toxicology, pathology and life sciences  <cit> .

human serum albumin  is a major protein component of blood plasma but is also found in the interstitial fluid of body tissues. in mammals, albumin is synthesized by the liver and has a half-life of  <dig> days in the circulation  <cit> . it is the major contributor to the oncotic pressure of the blood plasma  <cit> . it is called a multifunctional plasma carrier protein because of its ability to bind an unusually broad spectrum of ligands e.g. inorganic ions, various drugs, amino acids, fatty acids, etc. binding to hsa facilitates their transport throughout the circulation  <cit> . without doubt, interaction of any toxicant with hsa influences the transport of nutrients and drugs. recently, studies have been conducted on the binding of organic contaminants or toxins to hsa e.g. arazine  <cit> , ochratoxin  <cit> , methyl parathion  <cit>  and arsenic  <cit> . bindings of pfoa to biomacromolecular such as rat and human plasma proteins  <cit> , rat liver-form and kidney-form alpha 2u-globulins  <cit> , have been investigated at room temperature. the interaction of organic contaminants and hsa is always affected by various environmental conditions such as ph, strength and temperature  <cit> . in this work, we investigated the interaction of pfoa with hsa by equilibrium dialysis, fluorospectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry  and circular dichroism  under normal physiological condition, ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  m electrolyte and 37°c. the object is to analyze the interaction forces, sites and type and then further understand the toxigenicity of pfoa.

RESULTS
equilibrium dialysis of pfoa
the equilibrium dialysis method was used to investigate the interaction of pfoa with hsa. the pfoa concentration in the dialysis solution was measured at 37°c at various dialysis times with no protein in the membrane. the pfoa dialysis rate approaches 90% at  <dig> h and exceeds 98% after  <dig> h . pfoa passes freely through the semi-permeable membrane until equilibrium reached. hsa solution was put into the dialysis membrane as dialysate instead of pfoa, but it was found only in the dialysis bag. therefore, the equilibrium dialysis is suitable for investigating the interaction of pfoa with hsa. the dialysis solution was sampled and measured spectrophotometrically to determine the pfoa concentration after more than  <dig> h of dialysis.

characterization of the interactions of pfoa with hsa
the interaction of pfoa with hsa is summarized as follows:

  

both cl <dig> and cm <dig> are the initial mole concentrations of pfoa and hsa, cl is the equilibrium concentration of pfoa described above. n is the saturation binding number of pfoa. the effective fraction  of pfoa bound to hsa and its molar binding ratio  are calculated by the relations: f = 1-cl/cl <dig> and γ = fcl0/cm <dig>  the γ value will approach n with increasing pfoa.

in fact, ph varies widely among normal tissues in the human body. for example, less than ph  <dig>  in gastric fluid, ph  <dig>  in liver and saliva, ph  <dig>  –  <dig>  on the skin and around ph  <dig>  in blood and intestinal tract. normal human temperature is 37°c and the electrolyte concentration is between  <dig>  and  <dig> % . in this present work, the experiments were conducted in  <dig>  m nacl at ph  <dig>  at 37°c. by measuring a series of pfoa solutions containing known concentrations of hsa at ph  <dig> , the f and γ values were calculated according to the above equations. the f decreases linearly with increasing pfoa concentration from curve  <dig> in fig.  <dig>  but γ increases from curve  <dig>  the binding of pfoa approaches to a constant maximum at  <dig> when cl0/cm <dig> is more than  <dig> from curve  <dig>  the number of amino acid residues positively charged e.g. lys, his and arg is  <dig> in hsa, which is no correlation with such an n value. different from a sulfonic azo ligand  <cit> , the pfoa binding to hsa doesn't results from ion-pair attraction. strong intermolecular forces e.g. hydrogen bond, van der waals forces and hydrophobic interaction may be involved. the temkin isothermal model,   was used to fit the above experimental data. from curve  <dig> , the interaction of pfoa with hsa corresponds to chemical monolayer adsorption. both Δq and ka were calculated to be - <dig>  kj/mol and  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig>  the adsorption of pfoa on hsa is exothermic and non-covalent  <cit> , i.e. no strong bond was formed between pfoa and hsa.

in order to understand the mechanism of pfoa-hsa binding, some detailed thermodynamic data are needed. the itc measurement may provide information on thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy and heat capacity changes during the molecular interaction directly from the heat produced by the reaction, and have been used to study, for example, protein interactions  <cit> , dna triplex formation  <cit>  and hiv protease activity  <cit> . fig. 3a depicts a typical isothermal titration profile obtained by injecting pfoa into the itc cell containing hsa. the resulting values were plotted as a function of cl0/cm <dig> and fitted to a two-step sequential binding model by a nonlinear least squares method . values for the equilibrium constant , enthalpy change  and entropy change  of the pfoa-hsa reaction were obtained and calculated by the gibbs free energy  equation: Δg = -rtlnkb = Δh-tΔ s. the thermodynamic parameters derived from this curve are summarized in table  <dig>  because both Δhi values are much less than  <dig> kcal/mol  <cit> , the non-covalent binding of pfoa to hsa is confirmed.

pfoa is more lipophilic in aqueous solution and it decreased obviously the aqueous surface intensity. fifteen electrophilic f-groups in pfoa can attract strongly the lone pair electrons of polar side groups of peptide chain, e.g. f⋯n and f⋯o halogen bonding  <cit> . hsa is consisted of three homologous all α-helical domains , each divided into two subdomains  <cit> . all the helixic subdomains are distributed round a hydrophobic intracavity and the hydrophilic side groups of hsa exposed on the outer surface. in the first step, only one pfoa molecule bound on hsa . the f of pfoa is always more than 90% from curve  <dig> in fig.  <dig> when the cl0/cm <dig> is less than  <dig>  therefore, the first step is complete at approximately  <dig>  of cl0/cm <dig>  hsa binding pfoa caused the entropy decreasing  in this step. the refolding of hsa occurred by resuming the released heat. from Δg <dig> value, the pfoa-hsa reaction is spontaneous. moreover, the higher kb,  <dig> value indicated that the binding of the first pfoa molecule to hsa is firmer. from curve  <dig> to  <dig> in fig.  <dig>  the blue shift of peak emission wavelength from  <dig> to  <dig> nm indicated that the static quench of the hsa's intrinsic fluorescence occurred in the presence of pfoa, specially obviously when cl0/cm <dig> is less than  <dig>  thus, the first pfoa molecule may bind to the side group of tyr. as a result, the deformable linear pfoa may insert into the hydrophobic intracavity of hsa and bridge between subdomains iia and iib  across trp  <dig> by f⋯n and f⋯o halogen bonding with the polar side groups of asn, gln, asp, glu, arg, his, tyr and trp and hydrophobic interaction with the non-polar side groups, e.g. val, leu, met, ala and ile. the first step binding of pfoa to hsa is similar to that of long chain fatty acids to hsa  <cit> .

besides a long carbon chain, pfoa has strong extensibility on interface of water – particles so that it may spread on the exposed outer surface of hsa. when cl0/cm <dig> is more than  <dig>  pfoa began to bind on the hydrophilic surface of hsa till a saturation  via the polar bonds e.g. ionic interaction, hydrogen bond and f⋯n and f⋯o halogen bonding . by comparison of n obtained by equilibrium dialysis  and that  obtained by itc , two methods achieves the same result. from the higher Δh <dig> value, the binding sites of pfoa may bridge between any two helixes all over the outer surface of hsa . from Δg <dig> value , the pfoa-hsa reaction is spontaneous. in the 2nd step, the binding of pfoa to hsa caused an obvious entropy decreasing, i.e. more negative Δs <dig> , the hsa structure changed refolding.

by comparison of the emission spectra in fig.  <dig>  the obvious blue shift of peak wavelength was found when cl0/cm <dig> is more than  <dig>  this indicates an obvious change of hsa conformation, too. as a result, the interaction of pfoa with hsa is assignable under normal physiological condition. in addition, the β-pleated sheet content of hsa decreased obviously and its α-helix increased by 15% in the presence of pfoa from the change of cd spectra of hsa . thus, the second step in pfoa binding changed a substantial part of the β-pleated sheet of hsa into α-helix form. without doubt, such a binding would cause a great change of hsa structure and affect the function of hsa in blood.

CONCLUSIONS
the current work investigated the interaction of pfoa with hsa in the normal physiological acidities of blood and intestinal tract tissue where pfoa molecules may be present. the interaction of pfoa with hsa accorded with the langmuir isothermal model in two-step sequence, in which only one pfoa molecule entered the hydrophobic intracavity in the first step and  <dig> pfoa molecules binding on the hydrophilic outer surface in the second step. the interaction of pfoa and hsa is spontaneous and the non-covalent bond results in change of hsa conformation. the possible binding sites were also speculated. the present work proposed a determination and characterization method for the intermolecular weak interaction. if combined further with the other experiments e.g. biomolecular function effect  <cit> , cell membrane transport of contaminant  <cit>  and toxicological testing  <cit> , it is more helpful for elucidating the toxigenicity of perfluorochemicals.
