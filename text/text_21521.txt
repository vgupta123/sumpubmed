BACKGROUND
insect development occurs through a series of exoskeleton  renewals, or molts, that are timed by ecdysteroids pulses. molt succession includes apolysis , synthesis of a new cuticle and ecdysis .

after four molting episodes, the honeybee larva reaches the fifth larval instar without phenotypic changes, except for a considerable increase in size. the larva-to-pupa metamorphic molt takes place within the cuticle of the fifth larval instar. this is followed by pupal ecdysis, after which a white pupa breaks free from the larval cuticle. a genuine honeybee pupa exists for a relatively short period, lasting approximately 40 h from pupal ecdysis. apolysis marks the onset of adult cuticle synthesis and deposition. during the next 160 h, the bee is a pharate-adult, meaning that it is producing the adult cuticle underneath the pupal cuticle. melanization starts and intensifies in the adult cuticle throughout the final half of the pharate-adult period, even after adult ecdysis. concomitantly, the adult cuticle becomes increasingly sclerotized  <cit> . thus, development toward the adult stage involves the reconstruction and maturation of the definitive cuticular exoskeleton, formation of internal tissues and organs, and programmed cell death of many larval tissues.

the structure, chemical composition, mechanical properties and renewal of the insect exoskeleton during growth and metamorphosis have been extensively studied  <cit> . the exoskeleton mainly consists of the polysaccharide chitin and a variety of structural proteins, the cps. nearly a decade ago, willis et al.,  <cit>  compiled  <dig> insect cps derived from direct sequencing of purified proteins, or from conceptual translations of dna sequences. since then, insect genome projects have expanded the number and types of potential cps, thus underscoring the variety of cuticle-forming proteins  <cit> . however, except for extensive studies on cuticular gene expression in anopheles gambiae <cit> , few putative cp genes in annotated insect genomes have been experimentally validated . in a. mellifera, only six of the  <dig> cp genes screened in the annotated genome  <cit>  have been validated, including the amelcpr <dig> gene  <cit>  , three genes in the apidermins class  <cit> , and the tweedle class genes, ameltwdl <dig> and ameltwdl <dig> <cit> .

thoracic exoskeleton construction and differentiation in pharate-adults occur concomitantly with the de novo formation of striated muscle fibers. the larval thoracic muscles are entirely disintegrated during the honeybee metamorphic molt, and are replaced by imaginal muscles originating from myoblast precursors, which elongate, join, and form the striated muscle fibers. motor function is accomplished by the attachment of these muscle fibers to specific points, or ingrowths, in the developing thoracic exoskeleton  <cit> . thus, the integument  and associated musculature form a cohesive and functional structure.

the morphological and cellular changes in the dorsal portion of the honeybee thorax during the pupal-to-adult molt were previously characterized in our laboratory using conventional light microscopy  <cit>  and transmission electron microscopy  <cit> . in addition to these detailed morphological descriptions, we used oligonucleotide microarray hybridization analysis, real-time rt-pcr  transcript quantification and fluorescent in situ hybridization to extend our knowledge. unlike recent approaches in other insects, including microarray-based studies  <cit> , we studied honeybee gene expression in the context of reconstruction of the hard exoskeleton that forms the thoracic dorsum, which includes the pronotum, mesonotum, metanotum, propodeal tergum  and the subjacent musculature. in contrast to the diversity of cuticle types that covers the entire insect body , the thoracic dorsum is uniformly hardened and darkened. thus, genes involved in the formation of a hard cuticle could be characterized. the thorax also has fewer glands that could contribute to the total rna pool. although there are integument glands in the thorax  <cit> , they are much less abundant than in the abdomen. as described in drosophila, the thoracic dorsum  and associated musculature both originate from the same embryonic precursors   <cit> . thus we also investigated their potential shared gene regulatory networks for coordinated development.

our microarray analyses identified genes involved in adult thoracic dorsum formation. we used this information to characterize potential binding sites for known transcription factors in the upstream control region  of the differentially expressed genes . cp genes and muscle-related genes involved in thoracic dorsum formation were used to construct a putative gene regulatory network. ecdysteroids control the pace of pupal-to-adult molt and adult thoracic dorsum development; therefore, we could also identify cp- and muscle-related genes that are potentially regulated by these hormones.

methods
africanized apis mellifera samples
newly-ecdysed pupae , pupae-in-apolysis  and pharate-adults  were collected from colonies maintained at an experimental apiary  and staged according to the criteria established by michelette and soares  <cit> . dissections of the dorsal portion of the thorax, including pronotum, mesonotum, metanotum and the propodeal tergum, were performed in ringer saline . the total rna was extracted from samples using 1 ml trizol  following manufacturer’s instructions. the a. mellifera experiments performed in the present study comply with the current laws of brazil.

semithin sections
the thoracic dorsum of pupae and pharate-adults were dissected and immediately fixed in a mixture of glutaraldehyde 2% and paraformaldehyde 2% in  <dig>  m cacodylate buffer, ph  <dig>  for 2 h at 4°c. next, they were washed in  <dig>  m phosphate-buffered saline, ph  <dig>   and re-fixed for 30 min in 1% osmium tetroxide in  <dig>  m pbs. the samples were then dehydrated in a graded acetone series and propylene oxide, pre-embedded in lx <dig> resin  in propylene oxide  and, finally, embedded in pure lx <dig> resin. semithin sections  where stained with toluidine blue.

microarray hybridization and analysis
oligonucleotide-based microarrays  were purchased from the keck center for comparative and functional genomics, university of illinois, urbana-champaign, usa. the array contains oligonucleotide probes including  <dig>  protein-coding gene predictions from the honeybee genome, and probes specific for ests, pathogens and parasites in a total of  <dig>  oligos, comprising each  <dig> nucleotides double-spotted on glass microscope slides .

the experiments were designed and performed to meet the minimum information about a microarray experiment  specifications. the obtained microarray data were deposited at the gene expression omnibus database . the microarray experiments compared gene expression in the thoracic dorsum  of newly-ecdysed pupae, pupae-in-apolysis and pharate-adults  collected at the same time from a single honeybee colony. two separate pools of  <dig> thoraces  were prepared for each of these developmental phases. total rna was extracted from the pooled samples using trizol reagent and following manufacturer’s protocol. rneasy mini kit, qiagen, cat.  <dig>  was used to purify the extracted rna, which was quantified in nanodrop . one microgram of the purified total rna was used for rna amplification with amino allylmessageamp™ ii arna amplification kit , and following manufacturer´s protocol.

the microarray slides were uv cross-linked and subsequently incubated in  <dig> % sds for 2 min and rapidly in water and isopropanol, and centrifuged for 3 min at a low speed. pre-hybridizations were performed in a mixture of 20 ml formamide,  <dig>  ml ssc 20x, 10 ml denhardt’s solution 50x,  <dig>  ml trna 10 mg/ml, 1 ml sds 10% and  <dig>  ml milli-q water for 60 min at 42°c. the slides were then rinsed twice in milli-q water, soaked in isopropyl alcohol and dried by centrifugation at low speed for 3 min.

twenty micrograms of the amplified rna samples  were used for dual channel microarray hybridization with cy <dig> and cy <dig> dyes . dye swaps were done for each comparison and two slides were used to evaluate the differential expression. the rna was dye-coupled and combined with hybridization buffer , pre-heated at 55°c for 3 min, applied to arrays, and hybridized for 17 h at 42°c in single slide hybridization chambers placed in a water bath. a series of 30 s shaking washes in 2× ssc plus  <dig> % sds; 2× ssc;  <dig> × ssc and milli-q water, at room temperature, removed probe excess. the hybridized slides were spin dried and scanned using an axon genepix 4000b scanner  with genepix software , 10-micron resolution, cy <dig> with green laser , and cy <dig> with red laser . genepix pro  <dig>  software was used for quantification of the spots and image analysis with default parameters.

the microarray data analyses were performed with limma package  together with r   <cit> . the normexp method was used for background normalization adding an offset of  <dig> to the corrected intensities. normalization within-arrays was done using print-tip loess to adjust imbalances between the green and red dyes due to spot intensity and spatial position on the slide. average intensities were normalized between-arrays using the aquantile method. after normalization, the log <dig> ratio of gene expression differences between the developmental phases was calculated. fold-change values and standard errors were estimated by fitting linear regression to the normalized expression data. the empirical bayes statistics  was used for differential expression analysis  <cit> . the p-value of the differentially expressed genes was corrected using fdr   <cit> .

the degs were annotated according to gene ontology  terms for biological process , molecular function  and cellular component   <cit>  using david  gene functional classification tool   <cit> .

rt-qpcr analysis
the rna samples were incubated in the presence of  <dig> units of rnase-free dnase  for 40 min at 37°c to eliminate contaminant dna, and for 15 min at 70°c to inactivate the dnase. first-strand cdna was synthesized by reverse transcription  using  <dig>  μg of total rna, superscript ii reverse transcriptase and the oligo12– <dig> primer . reactions not including the superscript ii reverse transcriptase, or cdna template, were prepared as negative controls and analyzed in parallel. pcr amplification was carried out at a  <dig> real time pcr system  using 20 μl reaction volumes containing 10 μl sybr green master mix 2x , 1 μl cdna,  <dig>  μl water, and  <dig>  μl of each gene-specific primer  . the pcr conditions were 50°c for 2 min and 95°c for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 15 s, and 60°c for 1 min.

when possible , the primers used for amplification of the target genes were designed to span an intron, thereby serving as control for genomic dna contamination. the gene encoding a ribosomal protein, amrp <dig>  which is expressed in similar levels during the pupal and pharate-adult stages of the honeybee, and was validated as being a suitable reference gene  <cit> , was used for normalizing the rt-qpcr data. the primers for the amrp <dig> gene were designed to span one intron.

each pcr run was followed by melt curve analysis. primer specificity and absence of prime dimers were confirmed by the sharp melting curve of the pcr product and by the presence of a single band on agarose gel electrophoresis. the efficiency  of pcr amplification was calculated from the slope of standard curves  using the equation e =  <dig> and set near  <dig> 

to check reproducibility, each sybr green assay was done twice  and repeated with  <dig> independent samples . the baseline and threshold were correctly set. the data quantification and normalization relied on the calculation of target threshold cycle  values and reference gene ct values in qbaseplus version  <dig> software  <cit> .

cdna cloning and sequencing
the cdnas obtained from two putative cp genes, gb <dig> and gb <dig>  were amplified using specific primers . pcr products were subjected to electrophoresis on agarose gel, purified with perfectprep gel cleanup kit , and cloned into pgem-t easy vector . insert-containing plasmids were sequenced using m <dig> forward and reverse universal primers. dideoxy sequencing was performed in an abi prism  <dig> dna analyser using bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing ready reaction . sequencher™software version  <dig>   was used to analyze the sequences, which were then mapped to the annotated honeybee genome using artemis software .

fluorescent in situ hybridization
in situ hybridization was carried out to investigate the presence of gb <dig> and gb <dig> transcripts in the honeybee epidermis. to construct the fluorescent probes, pairs of specific primers were designed to amplify regions of the gb <dig> and gb <dig> dna sequences comprising  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively . single-stranded antisense and sense probes were synthesized using the fish tag rna green kit , following manufacturer’s instructions.

thoracic samples were dissected in cold ringer saline and fixed in 1 ml heptane, 80 μl hepes buffer , 100 μl 8% paraformaldehyde, 20 μl dimethyl sulfoxide  for 30 min under shaking. the fixative was discarded, the samples were quickly rinsed in absolute methanol  and in absolute ethanol , and then stored up to 2 weeks in ethanol at −20°c or immediately rehydrated in pbs ph  <dig>  containing  <dig> % tween- <dig> . after an additional fixation during 20 min in a 9:1 v/v mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde/ <dig> % triton x- <dig> and dmso, the samples were washed in ptw. to facilitate permeabilization and mrna probe penetration, samples were incubated in a freshly prepared 20 μg/ml proteinase k in ptw for 5 min, followed by washes in a filter-sterilized 10 mg/ml glycine solution. samples were then rinsed in ptw and re-fixed, as above. after washes in ptw, samples were equilibrated in hybridization solution  , washed in 1: <dig> ptw/hs and subsequently in hs. equilibrated samples were transferred to fresh tubes and pre-hybridized in hs for 1 h at 45°c. sense and antisense probes were separately diluted in hs , heat-denatured for 2 min at 98°c, chilled on ice and added to the pre-hybridized samples. hybridization was carried-out overnight at 45°c under gentle shaking. the hybridized samples were washed in hs: ptw  and in ptw solution. for cell nuclei co-localization the thoracic samples were stained with diamidino-2-phenylindole  diluted 1: <dig> in ptw, followed by washes in ptw. the thoracic pieces were transferred to 70% glycerol in ptw, and mounted on slides using slowfade ® gold  for observation under a confocal microscope tcs-sp <dig> aobs .

characterization of potential regulatory sequences
we retrieved functional information from the gene ontology  database  <cit>  for the d. melanogaster ortholog genes differentially expressed in the honeybee thoracic dorsum during the pupal-to-adult molt. a pipeline for cis-regulatory motifs discovery was designed based on reliable strategies previously proposed by macisaac and fraenkel  <cit> , and adapted to analyze the honeybee genome  <cit> . this pipeline integrates three motif-detection programs: alignace  <cit> , meme  <cit>  and mdscan  <cit> . honeybee intergenic databases were constructed for 3 kb sequence sizes that were trimmed whenever another open reading frame  was found to be flanking these regions. these databases were exploited for score calculations using group specificity scores   <cit> , roc-auc scores  <cit>  and enrichment scores  <cit> . two additional specific score metrics, the map score from alignace and mdscan and the e-value from meme, were also used as a first filter for selecting the most significant motifs . the second filter was set up to decrease the amount of spurious hits among the identified dna motifs . the main criterion for identifying known cis-regulatory sites among the overrepresented motifs was the alignment of the pssm  with the transcription factor binding sites as described in the transfac database, version  <dig>   <cit> . only the alignments passing a threshold of 70% identity for each pssm were considered as significant matches. we used concepts of graph theory and complex networks  <cit> .

we also used the consensus sequence for fushi tarazu transcription factor  <dig>  binding site  to build a pssm and then identify putative ftz-f <dig> binding sites  in the 3 kb upstream intergenic regions of selected degs. we used the same score metrics  to estimate the specificity of ftz-f <dig> binding sites.

RESULTS
ecdysteroid-coordinated development of the thoracic dorsum during the pupal-to-adult molt
figure  <dig> shows the ecdysteroid titer-coordinated changes in external morphology  during pupal-to-adult transition. toluidine-stained cross sections of the thoracic dorsal integument and subjacent tissues are also shown for pupae-in-apolysis and two successive pharate-adult phases. the ecdysteroid peak induces the detachment of the pupal cuticle from the epidermis. the exuvial fluid is then secreted by the epidermis in the space created beneath the detached pupal cuticle. next, the adult cuticle  is gradually deposited on the epidermis. the thoracic sections of the newly-ecdysed-pupae  and pupae-in-apolysis are histologically very similar, except that in the former the cuticle is still attached to the epidermis, while in the latter it is already detached.

changes in gene expression in the thoracic dorsum during pupal-to-adult development
the cdna microarray analysis revealed  <dig> and  <dig>  spots corresponding to up- or downregulated genes in the thoracic dorsum of pharate-adults compared with newly-ecdysed-pupae and pupae-in-apolysis, respectively. these genes represent  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the  <dig>  oligonucleotides spotted on the microarray slides. the oligonucleotide set included the following: official gene set sequences ; variable exons from the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin and from the ig-family gene dscam; representative genes from viral, fungal, bacterial, and microsporidian pathogens of honeybees; and non-ogs expressed sequence tags  from a subtractive library biased toward larval genes upregulated upon exposure to paenibacillus larvae. our analyses focused exclusively on the ogs sequences, which included  <dig>  and  <dig>   genes showing changes in their expression levels in pharate-adults compared with newly-ecdysed-pupae and pupae-in-apolysis, respectively. some of these oligonucleotides were duplicated in the microarray slides; thus, there were  <dig> and  <dig>  unique degs in the respective comparisons. notably, statistically significant changes in gene expression were not detected during the newly-ecdysed-pupae to pupae-in-apolysis transition; the changes were greater, and therefore statistically significant, after apolysis.

the numbers of degs in the thoracic dorsum are shown in figure  <dig>  some of these genes were differentially expressed in both comparisons; therefore, we compiled a total of  <dig>  unique degs. these data highlighted the changes in gene expression during the transition from pupal-to-adult thoracic dorsum. the up- and downregulated genes are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 4: table s <dig> 

figure  <dig> illustrates the magnitude of the differences in gene expression between the pupal and pharate-adult thoracic dorsum.

gene ontology  functional analysis
david was used for go analysis of degs that were orthologous to d. melanogaster genes. the comparisons of pharate-adults with newly-ecdysed-pupae or pupae-in-apolysis revealed  <dig>  and  <dig>   degs, respectively, with predicted orthology to d. melanogaster genes.

the go results for the enriched biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories are shown in figure  <dig>  degs from newly-ecdysed-pupae and pupae-in-apolysis were grouped in the same biological process categories  and molecular function . by contrast, pharate-adult degs were grouped in distinct biological process categories , and molecular function  .

several of the cellular component categories were shared by pupal and pharate-adult degs, although some of them  were exclusively assigned to pharate-adult degs .

therefore, go analysis clearly separated most of the pupal and pharate-adult degs into distinct functional categories.

differentially expressed cp genes
within the degs, we found  <dig> genes encoding cps. figure  <dig> shows the classes of differentially expressed cp genes detected in the microarrays. the cpr genes , which encode proteins containing the chitin-binding r&r consensus  <cit> , were the most abundant among the differentially expressed cp genes . the genes encoding apidermins , cpf and cplcp <dig> proteins, the analogous-to-peritrophins proteins am-c and am-d, and the tweedle <dig> and tweedle <dig> proteins accounted for the remaining differentially expressed cp genes. another three sequences, gb <dig>  gb <dig> and gb <dig>  were included in this list of cps .

the structures of the differentially expressed cp genes were determined in silico by mapping them to the annotated honeybee genome using artemis software  . the differentially expressed cp genes comprised  <dig> exons ,  <dig> exons , or 4– <dig> exons . the first exon is relatively small in  <dig> of the differentially expressed cp genes. schematic representations of the clustered cp genes are shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  and the characteristics of the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed cp genes are described in additional file 6: table s <dig>  all  <dig> cps contain an n-terminal signal peptide, consistent with their secretion by the epidermis to integrate the cuticle. a low molecular mass was a common feature shared with cps from other insects. of the  <dig> mature honeybee cps,  <dig>  have a molecular mass of less than 30 kda. the smallest cp is  <dig>  kda, and the largest is  <dig>  kda. the r&r consensus-type was identified using hmmfind software, available at the cuticledb web site , using default parameters. among the  <dig> cpr genes identified in the arrays, six contain the rr- <dig> consensus sequence, and five have the rr- <dig> consensus sequence. we could not determine whether the cpr gene amelcpr <dig> has the rr- <dig>  rr- <dig> or rr- <dig> consensus sequence.

the expression  of each of the  <dig> cp genes was quantified by rt-qpcr using specific primers and thoracic dorsum samples from newly-ecdysed-pupae, pupae-in-apolysis, and pharate-adults. the position of the primers in each predicted gene sequence is illustrated in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  seventy-two comparisons were performed in triplicate with independent samples. the rt-qpcr results agreed with the microarray data in  <dig> of these comparisons, indicating an accuracy of  <dig> %. except for the gene amelcpf <dig> , all the other  <dig> cp genes were upregulated in pharate-adults, when the adult cuticle is being deposited .

gb <dig> and gb <dig> genes are expressed in the epidermis
the protein fasta sequence of each deg was obtained from amel_prerelease2_ogs_pep data bank  using gbs as accession numbers. these sequences were analyzed by blastp using the non-redundant database . the first  <dig> blast hits were searched for the terms “cuticle”, “exoskeleton”, and “cuticular”, which could indicate similarity with described cps. the predicted proteins encoded by gb <dig>  gb <dig> and gb <dig> could not be unequivocally included in any of the  <dig> previously-defined cp classes  <cit> .

sequencing of the corresponding cdnas validated the sequences of gb <dig> and gb <dig> . both have features that may qualify them as encoding cps:  abundance of glycine residues ;  presence of ggygg and/or ggy motifs, typical of glycine-rich cps;  presence of an n-terminal signal peptide;  absence of cysteine residues in the mature protein .

using in situ hybridization, gb <dig> and gb <dig> transcripts were localized in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells in the thoracic dorsum of pharate-adults , where these genes were expressed at high levels . in summary, these genes are expressed in the epidermis and possibly encode proteins involved in cuticle formation.

the protein encoded by gb <dig> was identified in integument extracts from honeybee pupae and pharate-adults using 2-dimensional electrophoresis . well-focused protein spots were trypsin-digested, and identified by peptide mass fingerprint using maldi-tof mass spectrometry. mass spectra were analyzed against the ncbi non-redundant protein database using mascot software for protein identification and characterization. this analysis confirmed the presence of the gb <dig> protein in the integument  <cit> .

differential expression of genes related to thoracic muscle formation
among the degs, we detected genes that are potentially involved in the differentiation of thoracic muscles from precursor cells. myoblasts derived from mesenquimal cells are the precursors of myocytes that elongate and fuse to form the adult thoracic muscles  <cit> . conventional light microscopy analysis of the thoracic dorsum of pupae-in-apolysis  showed a mass of myocytes subjacent to the integument and surrounded by fat cells. the myocytes differentiate into striated muscle fibers that contact specific regions of the epidermis. functioning as tendons, the integument infolds  and specific points in the superficial epidermis serve as attachment sites for the striated muscles. muscle attachment to the epidermis starts in early pharate-adults . in the thoracic dorsum of the pbl phase, the musculature is already in close contact with the integument .

among the  <dig> genes identified as “muscle genes” in the deg list,  <dig> were upregulated during thoracic musculature formation . these genes are potentially involved in functions such as structural constituents of muscle fibers, muscle tendon junction, muscle attachment, adult somatic muscle development and sarcomere organization.

before the onset of muscle fibers formation from precursors, the thoracic dorsum is filled with fat body cells . as development proceeds, the fat body cells are gradually replaced by the thoracic musculature . the hexamerin genes highly expressed in the fat body, hex 70a , hex 70b , hex 70c  and hex  <dig> , were revealed in the microarray analysis of pupal thoracic dorsum. their transcript levels were reduced in the subsequent developmental phases, when the fat body cells become scant or disappear from the thoracic dorsum .

in summary, the developmental morphology of the thoracic dorsum was in agreement with the expression of fat body and muscle-related genes in the microarray data.

regulatory motifs shared by the degs
thirty motifs resembling previously identified transcription factor binding sites  were discovered in the ucrs of the honeybee degs . ten of these cis-regulatory motifs were shared by several of the upregulated cp- and muscle-related genes. the regulatory network shown in figure  <dig> organizes all this information and suggested that cp- and muscle-related genes are co-regulated in the developing thoracic dorsum.

motif_ <dig> and motif_ <dig> showed greater than 80% similarity with binding sites for known transcription factors. motif_ <dig> is 83% similar to the serpent  binding site. srp is a gata-like transcription factor involved in the specification of mesoderm-derived tissues in d. melanogaster, including the thoracic musculature. motif_ <dig> showed 87% similarity to the antennapedia  binding site motif, 85% similarity to the engrailed  and zeste  binding site motifs, 82% similarity to the giant  binding site and 88% similarity to the t-cell-factor  binding site. importantly, antp, en, z, and tcf are all expressed in the precursors of the thoracic dorsum, i.e., the wing imaginal discs .

we also found binding sites sharing more than 70% similarity with broad-complex  response elements . broad-complex isoforms are ecdysone signal-related transcription factors reported to be important during adult cuticle differentiation  <cit> . the presence of a br-c z3-like binding site  in the regulatory region of genes encoding a cp  and a muscle-related protein   suggests direct co-regulation by ecdysone during thoracic dorsum formation.

there is experimental evidence that the ftz-f <dig> transcription factor regulates the transcription of cp genes in b. mori and d. melanogaster ; therefore, we also searched for ftz-f <dig> binding sites in the promoter region of the upregulated cp- and muscle-related gene set shown in figure  <dig>  except for the occurrence of one ftz-f1-like binding site in the am-c gene , which is very similar  to the consensus sequence, the presence of ftz-f1-like binding sites was not supported by any of three enrichment scores used in our computational analysis .

discussion
differential expression of genes involved in thoracic dorsum formation during the ecdysteroid-regulated pupal-to-adult molt
our microarray data underscored the intense changes in gene expression in the thoracic dorsum during the pupal-to-adult molt, and revealed a set of genes involved in adult cuticle formation. go analysis clearly grouped the pupal and pharate-adult degs into distinct biological process and molecular function categories, and revealed the complexity of functions needed for the relatively rapid process of definitive exoskeleton formation.

the most represented go categories among the pupal degs were related to dna replication, transcription, mrna splicing and polyadenylation, trna metabolic process, rrna processing, translation, protein folding and golgi organization. this is in agreement with dna, rna and protein syntheses occurring in the epidermis for cell division or increase in size  <cit> . other go categories associated with pupal degs  suggest roles in cell division. such activities precede, and are usually correlated with, the increase in ecdysteroid titer and apolysis. furthermore, secretion and membrane trafficking apparently occurs in response to ecdysone, which has been reported to induce golgi formation .

by contrast, the most represented go categories among pharate-adult degs were mainly related to mitochondrial activity and energy generation . the go categories including structural constituent of the cuticle, peroxidase activity, oxidoreductase activity and transmembrane and protein transport, could be intuitively connected to adult cuticle deposition and differentiation.

the most prominent epidermal products involved in cuticle formation are the structural cps. based on sequence motifs, the cps identified to date in insects and other arthropods were tentatively classified into  <dig> different families  <cit> . only six of the  <dig> cp families have been predicted in the honeybee genome. proteins in these six families are encoded by  <dig> cp genes, of which  <dig> have the r&r consensus sequence characteristic of the cpr family, three encode proteins from the cpf/cpf-like families  <cit> , two encode tweedle proteins  <cit> , two encode cplcp proteins , three encode apidermins  <cit>  and five encode cpap <dig> family proteins   <cit> .

the whole-genome oligonucleotide array analysis revealed  <dig> cp genes, including six that were previously validated  <cit> . all but one  of these genes was upregulated during the synthesis and deposition of the adult cuticle. twelve of them encode cpr proteins. eight genes encode cps from the apidermin, cplcp, analogous-to-peritrophin and tweedle families. the other three upregulated genes  could not be categorized into a cp family. however, gb <dig> and gb <dig> sequences showed motifs and features that have been frequently used to identify putative cp genes in insect genomes. furthermore, in situ hybridization experiments showed that gb <dig> and gb <dig> transcripts are abundant in the epidermis during adult cuticle deposition, suggesting that their products are structural cps. the gb <dig> translation product was identified in the integument by 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, and was found in higher levels in pharate-adults than in pupae  <cit> . the upregulation of these  <dig> cp genes in pharate-adults, as verified in the microarray data, was confirmed by rt-qpcr transcript quantification. all these genes are induced after apolysis, i.e., after the ecdysteroid pulse, coinciding with adult cuticle deposition.

as revealed by microarray hybridization and rt-qpcr analyses, amelcpf <dig> did not fit the typical pattern of cp gene regulation because its expression is higher in the integument of newly-ecdysed-pupae than in pupae-in-apolysis and pharate-adults. this suggests that amelcpf <dig> is downregulated during apolysis by the ecdysteroid peak. this gene is apparently not involved in adult thoracic cuticle formation, although it may have a role in structuring the pupal cuticle. using stringent criteria for characterizing stage-specific cpr family genes in anopheles gambiae, togawa et al.  <cit>  identified genes that appeared to be specific to a single developmental stage, namely, the larval, pupal, or adult stages. the investigation of amelcpf <dig> expression in other developmental stages, or instars, may help to elucidate its stage-specific character.

the rt-qpcr findings highlighted the transient and statistically significant downregulation of amelcpr <dig>  apd- <dig> and gb <dig> during apolysis , when the ecdysteroid titer is maximal. several cp genes are downregulated in vivo by the high ecdysteroid titer that induces apolysis, or in vitro by a high ecdysteroid concentration; expression is then recovered following the hormone peak, or after its removal from the incubation medium . the ecdysteroid peak seems important for reprogramming these genes, and other genes involved in the molting process, for later expression. this type of ecdysteroid-modulated expression was previously demonstrated for amelcpr <dig> <cit> , ameltwdl <dig> and ameltwdl <dig> <cit> . the microarray and rt-qpcr findings have extended the number of cp genes that are potentially upregulated by the ecdysteroid pulse for construction of the adult exoskeleton.

the cpr genes upregulated in the thoracic dorsum of pharate-adults encode proteins containing rr- <dig>  or rr- <dig>  consensus sequences, implying that both contribute to the structure of the hard  thoracic cuticle. this finding contrasts with earlier studies connecting rr- <dig> to soft  cuticles and rr- <dig> to hard cuticles. this is a subject not yet fully resolved, because studies on cuticle genes and proteins have been mainly made with whole body extracts. andersen  <cit>  suggested that rr- <dig> proteins are part of the exocuticle deposited during the pharate stage, whereas rr- <dig> proteins integrate the post-ecdysial endocuticle. however, this hypothesis has not yet been unequivocally validated  <cit> .

the differential expression of genes encoding enzymes such as prophenoloxidase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and dopa-decarboxylase, which catalyze reactions leading to cuticle melanization and sclerotization, was not detected by the microarray analysis. we previously used rt-qpcr to investigate the expression of these genes in the honeybee integument  <cit> ; there were significant increases in transcript levels in pharate-adults  older than those used in the current study  . consequently, the genes encoding these enzymes were not detected among the degs in our microarray analysis. however, other genes potentially involved in cuticle tanning, such as those encoding a laccase  and five peroxidases, were upregulated in pharate-adults. amlac <dig> encodes a laccase involved in the cross-linking of cps and quinones for cuticle sclerotization  <cit> . two of the peroxidase genes, gb <dig> and gb <dig>  displayed 20% and 32% similarity , respectively, at the protein level with the translation product of a previously described cuticular peroxidase gene, ampxd   <cit> . these animal heme domain-containing peroxidases catalyze oxidative reactions, and may play a role in the oxidation of catechols to quinones, which leads to cuticle sclerotization  <cit> .

the other peroxidase genes included a glutathione peroxidase  and two peroxiredoxins , also known as thioredoxin peroxidases. the honeybee glutathione peroxidase gene was previously included in a study on the evolution of this gene family in invertebrates  <cit> . glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins have been characterized in numerous taxa as important antioxidants. both proteins were identified in the cuticle of parasitic nematodes, possibly for protection against reactive oxygen species generated by the defense system of the host .

like the cp genes and peroxidase genes identified in the microarray analysis, amlac <dig> and ampxd displayed increased expression in pharate-adults, following the ecdysteroid pulse.

cp- and muscle-related genes in the thoracic dorsum may share common regulatory motifs
studies in drosophila have shown that the notum epidermis and subjacent muscle fibers share the same precursors, i.e., both develop from the wing imaginal discs  <cit> ). the epithelial cells of the discs are ectodermal in origin and differentiate into the notum and wing epidermis. mesodermal adepithelial cells associated with the wing imaginal discs give rise to myoblast precursors of flight muscles  <cit> . ten of the  <dig> potential binding sites for known transcription factors in the transfac database were shared by upregulated cp- and muscle-related genes . thus, these genes may be co-regulated during the differentiation of the thoracic exoskeleton. two of these motifs, motif_ <dig> and motif_ <dig> , are noteworthy because they are more than 80% similar to binding site motifs for known transcription factors.

motif_ <dig> is similar to the srp transcription factor binding site. srp is important for differentiation of mesoderm-derived tissues, such as the fat body and muscle precursors, in d. melanogaster embryos  <cit> , and may downregulate the expression of a gene essential for myogenesis: mef <dig>   <cit> .

motif_ <dig> is highly similar to binding sites for transcription factors active in developing wing imaginal discs in drosophila, such as antp, z, en, and tcf. antp is expressed in the presumptive notum  region  <cit> . during metamorphosis, z is expressed in all imaginal disc derivatives and in the thoracic musculature of pharate-adults  <cit> . en plays a major role in the territorial subdivision of the imaginal wing discs for wing and thoracic dorsum  definition . dtcf  mediates the wingless  signal transduction pathway in the wing imaginal discs. like en, wg is a player in wing disc territorial subdivision, and is involved in intercellular signaling that specifies the wing and notum primordia  <cit> . it is likely that factors active in the precursors  remain active in the tissues derived from them . this is an inference awaiting functional analysis.

several of the potential transcription factor binding sites identified in the honeybee degs were previously found in a. gambiae cpr genes  <cit> , such as zen, gt, tll, eve, ubx, abd-b, twi, z, and broad-complex isoforms , the ecdysone signaling-related transcription factors. there is experimental evidence that broad-complex proteins regulate the transcription of cp genes in b. mori <cit> .

the presence of binding sites for br-c isoforms suggests that ecdysone directly regulates some degs during thoracic dorsum formation. as we previously demonstrated, the expression of the cp gene ameltwdl <dig> is modulated by the ecdysteroid titer  <cit> . the discovery of a potential br-c z3-like binding site motif in the ameltwdl ucr  is consistent with this finding. in d. melanogaster, the attachment of thoracic muscles to the dorsal epidermis requires br-c z <dig> function. it was proposed that br-c z <dig> is induced by ecdysteroids in the thoracic wall and regulates target genes involved in tendon cell maturation  <cit> . ecdysteroids also plays a key role in adult muscle development  <cit> . the muscle-related gene wnt <dig> has a potential br-c z3-like binding site motif , suggesting its regulation by ecdysteroids. in drosophila wnt <dig> mutants, flight muscles are lost or fail to attach to their epidermal targets during adult thoracic muscle formation  <cit> .

in addition to tweedle  <dig> and wnt <dig>  other upregulated cp- and muscle-related degs contain potential binding sites for br-c isoforms. motif_ <dig>  which is similar to the br-c z <dig> binding site, was identified in the cp gene encoding an apidermin, apd-2; motif_ <dig>  a possible binding site for br-c z2/z <dig>  was detected in the muscle-related gene myofilin. similarly, putative binding sites for br-c z <dig>  were identified in genes encoding a peroxidase and a peroxiredoxin. both enzymes have been associated with cuticle pigmentation and sclerotization  <cit> , which are regulated by ecdysteroids  <cit> . these motifs were omitted from the regulatory network  because they were identified in cp- or muscle-related genes, and the regulatory network was constructed exclusively with those motifs detected in both cp- and muscle-related genes.

functional analysis has shown that ftz-f <dig> regulates the transcription of cp genes in b. mori and d. melanogaster . although ftz-f <dig> binding sites are not enriched in the honeybee cp genes, the occurrence of a putative site in the am-c gene  may suggest this cuticular gene is regulated by ftz-f <dig> 

our bioinformatics approach only hints at the complex regulatory network supposedly involved in thoracic exoskeleton development. by integrating our data in a gene network  we provide a hypothetical framework, which can be the basis for further functional analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
our data broadens our understanding on thoracic dorsum formation, at the molecular level, during the pupal-to-adult molt. gene expression changes associated with formation of the hard thoracic dorsum in the honeybee were demonstrated using genome-wide cdna microarray analysis and rt-qpcr. of the  <dig>  degs,  <dig> were upregulated in the thoracic dorsum following apolysis, implying induction by the ecdysteroid pulse that triggers cuticle deposition. cp genes potentially encoding proteins of the cpr, tweedle, apidermin, cpf, cplcp <dig>  and analogous-to-peritrophins families were associated with thoracic dorsum formation. three other genes, which do not belong to any known cp families, are novel cp candidate genes. in support of this hypothesis, fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed abundant expression of two of these novel genes in the pharate-adult epidermis, which is actively engaged in adult exoskeleton synthesis. several potential binding sites for biologically relevant transcription factors were shared by upregulated cp- and muscle-related genes, suggesting co-regulation for coordinated development of thoracic exoskeleton and subjacent striated musculature. further functional analysis of these cis-elements will be needed to test this hypothesis.
