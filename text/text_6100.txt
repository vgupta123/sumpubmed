BACKGROUND
members of the genus chlamydia are gram-negative, obligate intracellular pathogens that share a biphasic developmental cycle. chlamydia pecorum infects a broad host range, including small and large ruminants, swine, birds and marsupials. seroprevalence and pcr-based studies suggest that infection or exposure to c. pecorum and/or c. abortus is almost ubiquitous in cattle and sheep . in the majority of these cases, infection is subclinical, with c. pecorum being routinely detected in the intestine and genital tract. the incidence and severity of disease caused by c. pecorum appears to be heightened in koalas and is associated with clinical disease such as conjunctivitis, urinary- and reproductive tract disease, and infertility  <cit> . many chlamydial species, including c. pecorum can enter persistent states, characterised in vitro by enlarged, morphologically aberrant, non-fusogenic reticulate bodies . persistence can be induced in vitro by antibiotic exposure  <cit> , amino acid-  <cit>  or iron-  <cit>  deficiencies and exposure to ifn-γ  <cit>  and it is likely that c. pecorum causes a persistent, subclinical infection in the host. subclinical infections can have detrimental effects on the animal’s health. animals with inapparent chlamydiae infections have higher body temperatures, lower body weights, reduced growth rates, reduced iron, haemoglobin, haematocrit and leukocyte levels and a higher incidence of follicular bronchiolitis . c. pecorum can also cause clinical disease including encephalomyelitis, vaginitis, endometritis, mastitis, conjunctivitis, polyarthritis, pneumonia, enteritis, orchitis, pleuritis, infertility or pericarditis  <cit> .

genetic variation has been reported to occur between c. pecorum strains in ompa, the rrn-nqrf intergenic region, inca, rrnas, a number of housekeeping genes and the hypothetical protein orf <dig> . these and other unidentified genomic differences may enable differentiation between strains isolated from asymptomatic or diseased animals. however, to date, only the genome sequence of a single c. pecorum strain  has been published  <cit> . the genetic factors responsible for the diverse host range, tissue tropism, disease outcomes and associated sequelae of c. pecorum infections are thus still poorly understood. in this study, we present the complete genome sequences of three c. pecorum strains isolated from animals exhibiting different disease manifestations and use comparative genomics to provide insights into the biology of c. pecorum and to identify both genus- and species-specific virulence factors.

RESULTS
genome features and comparative analysis
the genomes of c. pecorum pv3056/ <dig> , w <dig>  and p <dig>  each comprise a single circular chromosome of  <dig> ,552 bp,  <dig> ,534 bp and  <dig> ,412 bp, respectively. the general features of these genomes compared to reference strain e <dig>   <cit>  are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the g + c content of each genome is  <dig> % and none of the strains contain any plasmids. the origins of replication were assigned based on base composition asymmetry of the genomes and in each genome the oric is located upstream of the hemb gene. there are  <dig> trna genes corresponding to all the amino acids except selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, one rrna operon, and  <dig> srna molecules corresponding to ssra, rnasep and ffs  present in each chromosome. annotation identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  predicted coding sequences , representing a coding density of  <dig> %. of the predicted cdss,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were functionally assigned based on previous experimental evidence or database similarity and motif matches. for hypothetical proteins with no functional assignment,  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins  were either unique to c. pecorum or significantly similar to proteins from chlamydial species. the number of pseudogenes varied between c. pecorum strains, with the majority occurring due to frameshift mutations in homopolymeric tracts. pv3056/ <dig> contained  <dig> pseudogenes, while p <dig> and w <dig> contained  <dig> pseudogenes each. pseudogenes were annotated as phospholipase d family proteins, an abc transporter protein and hypothetical proteins .figure  <dig>

metabolic characteristics
comparative genomics of chlamydial species has identified a number of genes coding for metabolic functions, such as tryptophan metabolism, biotin biosynthesis and folate biosynthesis, where subtle variations in gene content may contribute to growth of the organism in vivo and the ability to evade the host immune system .

the genome of c. pecorum contains an almost intact tryptophan biosynthesis operon, consisting of anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase , phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase , indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase , tryptophan synthase alpha chain  and tryptophan synthase beta chain  genes. this complement of genes and the gene arrangement is most similar to that found in c. caviae, however the tryptophan biosynthesis operon in c. pecorum is not located in the plasticity zone and does not contain the additional trpb gene found in c. caviae <cit> . the complement of genes observed in c. pecorum would theoretically permit the production of tryptophan from the substrate anthranilate. however, the gene complement will not permit the first step of tryptophan biosynthesis, the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate, which is catalysed by anthranilate synthetase . the acquisition of anthranilate could be achieved by c. pecorum through the direct uptake of kynurenine from the host cell via an aromatic amino acid transporter similar to tyrp , converted to anthranilate by kynureninase  and further metabolised to phosphoribosyl anthranilate by trpd in the presence of prpp synthase and then to tryptophan via a series of intermediates . in mammalian cells, the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine ifn-γ by the host has been documented to decrease the availability of l-tryptophan in host cells by the induction of indoleamine  <dig> -dioxygenase  that converts l-tryptophan to l-formylkynurenine and then subsequently to kynurenine by arylformamidase  <cit> . this limitation of tryptophan by the host can lead either to the resolution of chlamydial infections or the establishment of persistent infections by chlamydial species  <cit> . the ability of c. pecorum to synthesise tryptophan in an ifn-γ rich environment may contribute to its ability to form persistent, subclinical infections.figure  <dig>

c. pecorum
and the host-cell involved in tryptophan metabolism.




the  <dig> sequenced c. pecorum strains and e <dig> contain the biotin biosynthesis operon encoding biobfda. . this region shows significant variability between chlamydial species, being absent in c. caviae, c. trachomatis and c. muridarum but present in c. abortus, c. psittaci, c. felis and c. pneumoniae. the ability to synthesise biotin is hypothesised to assist in the colonization of biotin-limited niches and contribute to the tissue tropism differences observed in the chlamydiae  <cit> . upstream of biobfda, located between dapb and biob, a series of genes encoding hypothetical proteins with unknown function and limited distribution across chlamydial species are present. chlamydia abortus, c. psittaci and c. felis genomes contain four genes , c. pneumoniae contains  <dig> genes in this region that are homologues of cab <dig> and cab <dig>  while c. pecorum contains one gene in this region that is homologous to cab <dig> .

three genes encoding key enzymes involved in folate biosynthesis, namely dihydrofolate reductase , dihydropteroate synthase  and dihydroneopterin aldolase , are absent from all  <dig> c. pecorum genomes . these genes are present in other chlamydiaceae species  . these findings suggest that c. pecorum will be unable to synthesize folate or  <dig> -dihydrofolate  and may require an exogenous source. in members of the firmicutes, this is achieved through active transport systems  <cit> , however homologues to these could not be identified in c. pecorum. the absence of genes fola and folkp in c. pecorum would theoretically confer a natural resistance to trimethoprim and sulphonamide antibiotics, which act as substrate analogues of dihydrofolate reductase  and dihydropteroate synthase , respectively. the absence of genes thya  and fola in all c. pecorum genomes indicates that the formation of  <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydrofolate , an essential donor of one-carbon units for dna, rna and protein syntheses, must be achieved through other pathways. indeed, all chlamydiaceae species sequenced to date, including c. pecorum, contain homologs for thyx , glya, fold, ygfa and fmt that encode enzymes allowing the synthesis and interconversion of carbon-one folate derivatives  in the production of dtmp  and formylmethionine . the flavin-dependent alternative thymidylate synthase thyx uses  <dig> -methylenetetrahydrofolate as a one-carbon donor and links dtmp catalysis with the formation of thf  <cit> . however, bacteria with a thyx+/fola-/thya- genotype, like c. pecorum, must still contain reduced folates for rna and protein synthesis to take place. this is likely achieved through an alternate pathway involving other enzymes encoded by glya , fold , ygfa  and fmt . the novel folate cycle observed in c. pecorum may contribute to the occurrence of persistent infections due to the limited pool of reduced folates available to the cell. as c. pecorum is likely to acquire folate directly from the host cell, increased competition could result in folate deficiency in the host, contributing to the increased levels of anaemia and lower body weights observed in infected animals  <cit> .figure  <dig>

c. pecorum
and other chlamydial species.




bacterial secretion systems
the c. pecorum genomes each contain  <dig> genes that encode members of the type v “autotransporter ” secretion system . in chlamydial species, these are referred to as polymorphic membrane proteins  and are present in all sequenced genomes, in numbers ranging from  <dig> in c. trachomatis to  <dig> in c. pneumoniae. c. pecorum ats range in predicted size and pi from  <dig> to 176 kda and  <dig>  to  <dig>  respectively  and possess the conserved at domain architecture comprising a central pmpm domain, c-terminal autotransporter  domain and predicted passenger-domains with a variable number of the repeat motifs gg and fxxn  <cit> . n-terminal signal sequences with potential signal peptidase  <dig> cleavage sites were identified in  <dig> ats . phylogenetic analysis of the c-terminal at domains identified the c. pecorum ats as belonging to  <dig> gene families. individual gene families showed high bootstrap support  but only weak support at deeper branches  . phylogenetic network analysis performed on at sequences show separation into the at gene families but suggests that recombination is occurring between at domains  . ats were located in  <dig> genetic loci consisting of two singletons belonging to the pmpd  and pmpg  protein families, two pairs of genes belonging to pmpb and pmpa , and a cluster of  <dig> genes belonging to the pmpe , pmph  and pmpg  protein families . all at-encoding genes were intact in c. pecorum except for the gene encoding pmpa in e <dig> . based on the short length of homopolymeric tracts identified in c. pecorum ats , it appears less likely that expression of these genes are subject to phase variation by strand slippage mechanisms compared to ats from other organisms such as c. abortus .figure  <dig>

the type iii secretion system  consists of  <dig> genes encoding the major structural components of the secretion apparatus, accessory proteins and chaperones and is arranged in  <dig> genetic loci . in sequenced chlamydial genomes, a number of putative t3ss effector proteins belonging to the inc or transmembrane head  protein family are located in the region extending between pmpd and lpxb . the distance between the 3′ ends of these genes in c. pecorum is ~ <dig>  kb  compared to  <dig>  kb c. abortus ,  <dig>  kb in c. psittaci ,  <dig>  kb in c. caviae ,  <dig>  kb in c. felis  and  <dig>  kb in c. pneumoniae . the two genes present in this region in c. pecorum , cpe1_ <dig>  cpe2_ <dig>  cpe2_ <dig>  cpe3_ <dig>  cpe3_0766) possess an n-terminal signal sequence, a single n-terminal transmembrane domain and two domains of unknown function . members of this protein family are present in c. abortus, c. psittaci, c. caviae and c. felis  and c. pneumoniae .

simple sequence repeats
a region of variability between c. pecorum and other chlamydial species is located immediately upstream of the 5s rrna gene. this region, between the 3′ ends of the 5s rrna and nqrf genes range in size from 261–269 bp in c. pecorum to 4464 bp in c. caviae. in c. caviae this region encodes a 1291aa residue pseudogene identified as a member of the virulence-associated invasion/intimin family of outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria. the genome of c. abortus contains two cdss in place of the intimin family gene in this region, encoding a conserved membrane protein and a unique hypothetical protein. in c. psittaci, c. felis and c. muridarum these two proteins are fused to encode a single hypothetical protein. in c. pecorum there are no predicted cdss in this region and the intergenic region between the 5s rrna and nqrf genes comprises an 8 bp simple sequence repeat sequence aaagcact repeated  <dig>  or  <dig> times  .

clustered tandem repeat sequences  appearing in the hypothetical protein orf <dig>  have been used to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of c. pecorum with non-pathogenic strains containing a greater number of ctrs  <cit> . the c. pecorum strains contained different numbers and types of ctrs varying from 14– <dig> ctrs in the c. pecorum strains originating from diseased animals  to  <dig> ctrs in w <dig> that was isolated from an animal with subclinical disease . whilst no predicted function has been assigned to orf <dig>  n-terminal signal peptides and two transmembrane domains were identified in the corresponding genes of pv3056/ <dig>  w <dig> and p <dig> suggesting that the protein may be surface expressed. indeed, the high proportions of serine , proline  and lysine  in orf <dig> could indicate adhesion functions, such as those observed in staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.  <cit> . in streptococcus sp. correlations between the number of ctrs and pathogenicity has been reported, with deletions in the ctr causing either a loss of conformational epitopes or a decrease in the antigen size and reduction in antibody binding to the bacterial surface, resulting in increased pathogenicity  <cit>  and it is feasible that this also occurs in chlamydiae.table  <dig> 
clustered tandem repeat  sequences observed in orthologs of hypothetical protein orf663




the inca protein is an effector protein secreted by the type iii secretion system  that is known to localize to the chlamydial inclusion membrane  <cit> . in c. pecorum, inca has been identified as an antigen that can be used for serodiagnosis  <cit> , and the identification and survey of ctr sequences in inca from isolates originating from symptomatic and asymptomatic animals suggest that the inca ctr motif composition in c. pecorum could be associated with virulence  <cit> . the number and composition of inca ctrs in the sequenced genomes varied from  <dig> in p <dig> to  <dig> in w <dig> . this differs from those previously reported for e <dig>  and w <dig>   <cit> . the differences observed in these ctrs between strains held in different laboratories could result from adaptation of the strains to laboratory growth conditions. as inca has been shown to contribute in establishing interactions between the inclusion and the host cell, participating in vesicle fusion or septation of the inclusion membrane during bacterial cell division  <cit> , the presence of ctrs could contribute to the ability of c. pecorum to evade the host immune system or contribute to the formation of sub-clinical infections by forming non-fusogenic inclusions  <cit> .table  <dig> 
clustered tandem repeat sequences  observed in inca




plasticity zone
in chlamydial species, the plasticity zone is defined as the region between inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase  and acetyl-coa carboxylase  and is the region of the genome that is most variable in gene content and sequence. in c. pecorum, this region is  <dig> - <dig>  kb in size and contains  <dig>  or  <dig>  genes encoding gmp synthase, an adenosine deaminase superfamily-protein, a mac/perforin domain-containing protein,  <dig>  or  <dig>  phospholipase d family proteins,  <dig> cytotoxins and  <dig> hypothetical proteins .

the presence of two cytotoxin genes in the pz of each of the sequenced c. pecorum strains  may contribute to the ability of the organism to switch from persistent infection to causing acute disease. the cytotoxin genes share sequence similarity with e. coli and citrobacter rodentium lymphocyte inhibitory factor a  and clostridium difficile toxin b as well as other chlamydial cytotoxins. the 10– <dig>  kb cytotoxins in c. pecorum consist of an n-terminal glucosyltransferase domain responsible for the biological effects of the toxin, a cysteine protease domain responsible for autocatalytic cleavage and a large domain of unknown function that may play a role in cytotoxin translocation or receptor binding. phylogenetic analysis of cytotoxins from c. psittaci, c. felis and c. cavie , c. pecorum  and c. muridarum  reveals extensive diversity within these genes . c. pecorum cytotoxins belonged to two separate gene clusters  each showing greatest similarity to cytotoxins from c. muridarum. it is unclear whether the two different cytotoxins in c. pecorum have different biological functions or host specificity. related cytotoxins in e. coli and c. difficile act by glycosylating small gtp-binding proteins of rho and ras families, inhibiting the host signalling and regulatory functions  <cit> , lymphocyte activation  <cit>  and by blocking the induction of ifn-γ. numerous studies have shown the progression of the chlamydial infection cycle to be influenced by ifn-γ production by the host. at low ifn-γ concentrations acute infections typically occur whereas persistence and clearance of infection occurs at medium and high ifn-γ concentrations, respectively  <cit> . the ability to block ifn-γ production by the host cell may be an important virulence determinant of c. pecorum enabling persistent infection of the host with acute disease symptoms occurring when cytotoxins are overexpressed.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic analysis of chlamydial cytotoxins. bayesian  phylogenetic tree calculated using a wag + i + g substitution model of cytotoxin protein sequences of chlamydiaceae species. trees were generated using markov chain monte carlo settings of  <dig> runs of  <dig>  generations with a burn-in of  <dig>  generations with trees sampled every  <dig> runs. posterior probabilities are indicated by the number at the node.



flanking the cytotoxin genes in c. pecorum are  <dig>  or  <dig>  phospholipase d  genes each containing the conserved hxkx4dx6gsxn  motif essential for the initiation of phosphodiesterase activity and amino acid motifs that are responsible for catalytic activity. pld genes identified in the plasticity zone of p <dig>  w <dig> and e <dig> share 95-99% amino acid sequence identity  whereas orthologous pld genes in pv3056/ <dig> are more divergent  . the remaining pld gene is almost identical in e <dig> and w <dig>  but divergent in the remaining strains . the presence of poly and poly homopolymeric tracts ranging in size from 5– <dig> nucleotides within the pld genes and the presence of intact variants in the sequence reads of pseudogenes could indicate that these proteins are subject to phase variation by slip-strand pairing  <cit> . whilst the function of pld in c. pecorum is currently unknown, pld can perform numerous functions ranging from dna hydrolysis, to protein-protein interactions with host signalling pathways, to the more classic lipase function. in c. trachomatis, pld genes located in the pz have been associated with inclusion formation  <cit> , whereas in other bacteria pld has been identified as an important virulence determinant involved in dissemination, serum resistance and invasion of epithelial cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome sequence of c. pecorum p <dig>  w <dig> and pv3056/ <dig> was determined by illumina/solexa and roche  <dig> genome sequencing. despite the differences in the clinical manifestations of infections caused by the strains, comparative analysis revealed a high level of sequence conservation, gene content and order between the genomes. additional genomic analyses of strains originating from other non-ruminant host species, such as pig and koala, will determine if the high level of sequence similarity is common to all, or just ruminant strains of c. pecorum. in agreement with previous studies  <cit> , differences in the number of clustered tandem repeat sequences in orf <dig> were observed between strains isolated from diseased  or asymptomatic  animals however, no other genetic differences were observed that may account for the different disease manifestations. a number of metabolic traits were identified in c. pecorum that may contribute to its ability to evade the host immune system and enable persistent infections to be established in the host. specifically, this study has particularly highlighted the absence of genes involved in folate biosynthesis and the presence of tryptophan and biotin biosynthesis pathways. the presence of clustered tandem repeats in surface expressed proteins,  <dig> polymorphic membrane proteins, two cytotoxin genes and multiple phospholipase d genes that are likely to be subject to phase variable expression may play a role in the invasion of host cells and trigger the switching between persistent and acute disease in the host.
