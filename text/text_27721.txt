BACKGROUND
canine mammary tumors are the most common tumor in female dogs. the spontaneous, naturally occurring canine mammary tumors share many features with human breast cancer such as the predominant malignant histological type being adenocarcinoma  <cit>  and the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors , and epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig>  in subsets of canine mammary carcinoma  <cit> . it has been suggested that canine mammary carcinomas may be a suitable natural model for the comparative study of human breast cancer  <cit> .

the krüppel-like factor  family proteins are transcription factors that play important roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including embryogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, migration, inflammation and tumorigenesis  <cit> .

the klf family consists of  <dig> different members in which many have been identified as potentially novel oncogenes or tumor suppressors  <cit> . human klf <dig> was first identified using a dna probe containing the zinc finger region of human erythroid krüppel-like factor from human umbilical vein endothelial cell cdna library  <cit> . the biological effects of klf <dig> seem to depend on cancer type rather than unique. klf <dig> transcription factor can function as a tumor suppressor and is down-regulated in various human cancer types such as gastric and colorectal cancer  <cit> . on the other hand, high level and oncogenic role of klf <dig> were also reported in human breast cancer and oral squamous carcinoma  <cit> . this study investigated the presence of klf <dig> and established their clinical significance in canine mammary carcinoma.

RESULTS
one hundred forty-two dogs  were investigated in this study. of the  <dig> cases,  <dig> %  were histologically confirmed as carcinoma.

analyzing the expression of klf <dig> in paraffin-embedded tissues by ihc revealed up-regulated nuclear klf <dig> expression in mammary carcinomas as compared to benign tumor cases . we divided carcinoma patients into three groups, either high klf <dig> expression with quick score of 9- <dig>  moderate klf <dig> expression with quick score of 5- <dig>  or weak klf <dig> expression with quick score of 1- <dig> . high expression of klf <dig>  was identified in 59%  of dogs with mammary carcinoma and none in the benign tumors. moreover, high expression level of klf <dig> occurred preferentially in the tumor cells and not the adjacent non-tumor cells in mammary carcinoma . chi-square analyses for the clinicopathologic characteristics of the  <dig> canine mammary carcinoma cases in relation to nuclear klf <dig> expression showed that high klf <dig> expression correlated significantly with shorter 24-month survival . high klf <dig> expression was also closely associated with poor grade, late stage, and histological subtypes of simple and complex carcinoma. the kaplan-meier survival curves indicated that patients with high nuclear expression of klf <dig> had a significantly poor survival than those with low/moderate klf <dig> expression as defined by log-rank test .

a twenty-one cases lacked survival data and were excluded from the analysis.

discussion
studies of klf proteins in mouse models of human diseases have revealed the normal biological roles of the klfs as well as their involvement in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases such as cancer  <cit> . previous studies have shown that approximately 70% of human breast cancer has increased klf <dig> expression and that up-regulated nuclear klf <dig> expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype  <cit> . the oncogenic properties of klf <dig> in breast cancers was also confirmed in vitro and using xenograft tumor model in which klf <dig> knockdown inhibited breast cancer development  <cit> .

the breast cancer stem cell hypotheses suggest that breast cancer is derived from a single cell with stem-like properties that is capable of tumor initiation and formation. klf <dig> can inhibit differentiation and increase self-renewal in embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . forced expression of klf <dig>  along with transcription factors, oct <dig>  c-myc, and sox <dig>  can reprogram or dedifferentiate somatic cells into

induced pluripotent stem cells  in both mice  <cit>  and human  <cit> . taken together, these finding suggest that klf <dig> is indispensable for the regulation of stem cells and contributes to tumorigenesis.

in this study, we investigated the expression and clinical relevance of klf <dig> in canine mammary carcinoma. immunihistochemistry revealed that nuclear expression of klf <dig> was elevated in tumor cells of canine mammary carcinoma. although increased klf <dig> expression was not related to prognostic markers such as er, pr or her <dig>  high nuclear klf <dig> expression was associated significantly with a more aggressive phenotype as indicated by poor grade, late stage, histological subtypes of simple and complex carcinoma, and shorter 24-month survival in canine mammary carcinoma. despite diffuse cytoplasmic klf <dig> expression with different degree of intensity was observed among the samples. the cytoplasmic klf <dig> expression was not related to any clinicopathologic parameters and survival . the kaplan-meier survival analysis also indicated that dogs with high nuclear expression of klf <dig> had a significantly shorter survival as compared with ones with low/moderate nuclear klf <dig> expression.

we provided evidence for the first time that klf <dig> is preferentially and highly expressed in canine mammary carcinoma. as in human breast cancer, klf <dig> plays an oncogenic role in canine mammary carcinoma. further studies are needed to validate whether systemic targeting of klf <dig> would inhibits the oncogenic functions of klf <dig> thus provides an effective strategy for the treatment of canine mammary carcinoma.

CONCLUSIONS
nuclear expression of klf <dig> is frequently elevated in canine mammary carcinoma and closely correlated with a more aggressive phenotype and shorter survival.
