BACKGROUND
the preclinical validation process in cancer drug discovery generally comprises a series of primary biochemical and cell-based assays, followed by evaluation in animal tumor models. however, there is a high rate of attrition and fewer than 10% of candidates identified by high-throughput  screening become licensed drugs  <cit> . standard two-dimensional cell cultures for testing effects of anticancer agents are simple and convenient, but present significant limitations in reproducing the complexity and pathophysiology of in vivo tumor tissue  <cit> .

three-dimensional culture systems are of increasing interest in cancer research since tissue architecture and the extracellular matrix  significantly influence tumor cell responses to microenvironmental signals. for example, inhibition of β1-integrin on breast tumor cells reverted their morphological and functional features to a normal epithelial phenotype, but only in three dimensions  <cit> . this and many other studies have highlighted significant differences between two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, with the latter reflecting better the in vivo tumor microenvironment in terms of cellular heterogeneity, nutrient and oxygen gradients, cell-cell interactions, matrix deposition and gene expression profiles  <cit> . to model solid tumors more effectively, several three-dimensional culture systems have been established: whole perfused organs, tissue explants, scaffold/microcarrier-based cultures, hollow-fiber bioreactors, organotypic cultures  and gel/matrix-based cultures  <cit> . of these, the multicellular tumor spheroid model is the best characterized and most widely used.

tumor spheroids are heterogeneous cellular aggregates that, when greater than  <dig> μm diameter, are frequently characterized by hypoxic regions and necrotic centers  <cit> . three-dimensional spheroids are therefore considered valid models to recapitulate features of tumor microregions, intervascular domains or micrometastases  <cit> . sutherland et al. first applied this technique in cancer research  <cit> . since then, several methods have been used to generate tumor spheroids: spontaneous aggregation  <cit> , spinner flasks  <cit> , rotary cell culture systems  <cit> , poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate -coated plates  <cit> , hanging drops  <cit> , liquid overlay on agar  <cit> , low binding plates  <cit> , gel/matrix-based culture  <cit> , polymeric scaffolds  <cit>  or micropatterned plates  <cit> .

each method has advantages and limitations  <cit>  but simple, standardized and rapid protocols appropriate for routine preclinical drug development studies within academic or pharmaceutical labs are lacking. furthermore, there is an appreciation that the next generation of anticancer drugs will need to address aspects of the malignant phenotype beyond cell proliferation if we are to effectively address disseminated disease. we have therefore developed a complete suite of in vitro three-dimensional spheroid-based assays for measuring tumor growth, migration, invasion and tumor angiogenesis that, combined with new technologies of automated imaging and analysis, demonstrate applicability in relatively high-throughput formats.

we initially screened and classified a diverse collection of human tumor cell lines for their ability to form spheroids. for more detailed assay exemplification, selected lines representing highly malignant human tumors and characterized by an optimal three-dimensional structure were used. the following report is divided into two sections: a description of the establishment of the suite of three-dimensional spheroid growth and functional assays, and an exemplification of the utility of the assays to measure inhibitory effects of molecularly targeted agents. inhibitors of heat shock protein  <dig>  chaperone ), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase -mammalian target of rapamycin   and phospholipase c γ , representing a variety of validated targets in tumor growth, invasion and angiogenesis  <cit> , were selected for evaluation. we believe that these assays will contribute to increased utility and predictive value of preclinical drug discovery studies.

RESULTS
establishment of three-dimensional spheroid-based assays
rapid generation of reproducibly sized tumor spheroids and automated growth kinetic analyses
to deploy three-dimensional cultures in cancer drug discovery and target validation, we established a standardized microplate method with the following desirable characteristics:  96-well suspension culture;  a single spheroid/well, centered for ease of optical imaging;  high reproducibility;  simple harvesting for further analysis;  fully automated imaging and quantitative analysis.

we used ultra-low attachment  96-well round-bottomed plates that, in contrast to standard methods, do not require coating to prevent cell adhesion. tumor cell suspensions formed a three-dimensional structure within  <dig> to  <dig> h. the well shape promotes the formation of single, centrally located spheroids of reproducible size . optimal seeding densities were established such that tumor spheroids for every cell line tested  fell within a size range of  <dig> to  <dig> μm in diameter on day  <dig>  considered appropriate for initiating experimental studies. cultures were maintained by replacing 50% of the medium on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

for rapid, routine imaging and analysis of tumor spheroids, we utilized a celigo™ cytometer  , which is a benchtop in situ cellular analysis system providing high quality, full or partial images of wells using brightfield or fluorescent illumination. images were acquired and analyzed using the colony counting embryoid body  application that identifies and counts individual three-dimensional structures  and small clusters of cells. with our centrally located spheroids and by selecting 1/ <dig> field of view/well  the celigo cytometer scans a ula 96-well plate in  <dig> minutes, allowing fast, automated multiparametric analysis including measurements of spheroid diameter, perimeter and area. this application allows the generation of image segmentation around the spheroid, as shown in figure 1b. images are acquired at intervals and growth curves are rapidly and easily generated, showing linear volume increases up to  <dig> days following cell seeding. an example using u- <dig> mg glioblastoma is shown in figure 1c. small standard deviations demonstrate the reproducibility and robustness of the method.

we tested  <dig> tumor cell lines in total  and classified spheroids according to their morphology, extending the original ivascu classification  <cit>  as follows: tight spheroids : tight, spherical and regular; compact aggregates : acceptable for three-dimensional studies but less regular; loose aggregates : irregular, friable aggregates . the three-dimensional structure of compact and loose spheroids can be improved by the addition of matrigel™  at the time of initiation, extending the range of tumor cells suitable for further study .

acell lines in which three-dimensional structure is improved by addition of matrigel at spheroid initiation.

medium:  <dig> = dmem;  <dig> = dmem:f12;  <dig> = rpmi;  <dig> = iscove's modified dulbecco's medium;  <dig> = eagle's minimum essential medium.

atcc = american type culture collection; c = compact aggregate; ecacc = european collection of cell cultures; gbm = glioblastoma; jcrb = japanese collection of research bioresources; l = loose aggregate; scc = squamous cell carcinoma; t = tight spheroid

to demonstrate the reproducibility in spheroid size, the coefficient of variation  of spheroid volumes on day  <dig> was determined for selected highly malignant tumor cell lines that form tight spheroids. the intraplate cv was  <dig> % to  <dig> % for u- <dig> mg ,  <dig> % to  <dig> % for kns <dig>  and  <dig> % to  <dig> % for licr-lon-hn <dig> . the interplate cv gave values of  <dig> % for u- <dig> mg,  <dig> % for kns <dig> and  <dig> % for licr-lon-hn <dig> . furthermore the spheroid volume distribution follows a gaussian distribution . similar results were obtained for other cell lines such as kns <dig> and licr-lon-hn <dig> .

in order to compare our system to a standard conventional method, u- <dig> mg spheroids were initiated and cultured in parallel on agar-coated 96-well flat-bottomed plates  <cit>  and in ula 96-well round-bottomed plates . the agar-coated plates, unlike the ula plates, proved unsuitable for automated image analysis on the celigo cytometer . thus, images were obtained at intervals using an olympus ix  <dig>  inverted microscope. analysis was carried out using image-pro plus analyzer software . reproducibly sized spheroids  were obtained in each system, with ula spheroids growing to slightly larger sizes than the agar-based spheroids but both growth curves reached a plateau at around day  <dig> .

spheroids grown on ula plates showed a more compact structure than those on agar-coated plates . in both cases,  larger u- <dig> mg spheroids develop a gradient of proliferation as measured by ki- <dig> staining  <cit>  and a more intense glucose transporter  <dig>  staining  that correlates with tumor hypoxia  <cit> . central necrosis was not evident in u- <dig> mg spheroids over this observation period although was seen in hct  <dig> spheroids . thus, overall our system compares closely with conventionally-generated spheroids, but with the advantage that automated analysis and retrieval of spheroids for molecular analysis is more easily achieved with suspension cultures in ula plates. u- <dig> mg spheroids were also grown on poly-hema-coated 24-well plates and in a rotary cell culture system   but multiple non-reproducibly sized spheroids were formed and hence these methods were not pursued further.

three-dimensional tumor spheroid functional assays
another major advantage of our approach is its convenient extension to additional three-dimensional functional assays to address important cellular processes in tumor progression:  migration on extracellular matrix proteins ,  invasion into matrigel and  simultaneous tissue invasion/angiogenesis  .

migration on matrix protein
we utilized a tumor spheroid-based migration assay that resembles tumor cell dissemination from a solid microtumor or micrometastasis in terms of engagement of host stromal matrix proteins with characteristics that differ from isolated cells  <cit> . the same type of assay has been used previously in a lower throughput format and with more time-consuming methods for generation of tumor spheroids  <cit> . we successfully modified the assay for ht format by rapidly transferring tumor spheroids generated in ula round-bottomed plates into gelatin-coated flat-bottomed 96-well plates  using a multichannel pipette . within a few hours, tumor cells disseminate from the spheroid over the coated surface  <cit>  and migration is recorded at intervals up to  <dig> h. images can be obtained using an inverted microscope and analysis performed using image-pro analyzer software by manually recording the leading edge of the migrating cells, which enables the software to calculate the area covered. this assay also provides valuable qualitative information on different cell migration patterns . for example, u- <dig> mg cells show rapid, single cell dispersal resembling typical amoeboid migration  <cit> . in contrast, kns <dig> cells move slowly and collectively in a radial pattern, reflecting a more mesenchymal phenotype  <cit>  .

three-dimensional invasion into matrigel
to measure three-dimensional tumor invasion , spheroids are initiated as described above and on day  <dig> matrigel is added to the wells. this provides a semisolid gel-like matrix into which cells extend invadopodia  <cit> ; these processes contribute to cell movement and also matrix degradation via localized proteolysis  <cit> . within a few hours, the invadopodia are apparent and invasion is monitored at intervals over  <dig> h. image analysis is performed on a celigo cytometer by using the cell counting confluence application, which determines the area occupied by individual cells or cell clusters, identified by image segmentation around the invading cells . the central location of each spheroid allows rapid and automated image analysis and by selecting 1/ <dig> field of view per well the scan is completed within  <dig> minutes/plate. alternatively, images can be obtained using an inverted microscope and analysis is performed as described for the migration. microscopy additionally provides detailed images of the invading cell protrusions as shown in figure 4e.

tissue invasion and angiogenesis
the angiogenic switch is a critical step in tumor progression  <cit> . we modified a confrontation culture assay of spheroids and ebs  <cit>  to mimic simultaneous tissue invasion and tumor angiogenesis in vitro. with their complex cellular heterogeneity, including differentiated endothelial cells, ebs represent a true tissue environment. the method is a simple three-step procedure:  culture of mouse embryonic stem cells  ;  differentiation of mescs into ebs ;  coculture of spheroids and ebs . to optimize the assay for future ht target validation and/or drug evaluation studies, ebs were grown in ula 96-well round-bottomed plates rather than petri dishes  <cit>  or spinner flasks  <cit> , increasing eb reproducibility and significantly reducing the time needed for assay set-up. fully automated cytometer image analysis shows linear growth curves with increased variability only during later stages of maturation . consistent with previous reports  <cit> , we demonstrated endothelial differentiation by cd <dig> staining .

our confrontation culture is a significant enhancement of previous assays, since day  <dig> tumor spheroids are transferred directly into wells containing day  <dig> ebs  and the system allows real-time analysis of subsequent interactions. representative images from the celigo cytometer show two distinct bodies at confrontation, with the u- <dig> mg spheroid identified by green fluorescent protein  fluorescence. the mutual integration process is complete within  <dig> to  <dig> h, as shown in the merged brightfield and fluorescent images . confrontation cultures can also be imaged by microscopy, allowing timelapse studies . treatment with 17-aag was shown to inhibit u- <dig> mg eb tissue invasion . tumor-stimulated angiogenesis is illustrated by immunohistochemical staining of eb-derived endothelial cells within tumor spheroids .

together, these assays provide a suite of novel, complementary functional assays with immediate relevance to cancer progression and enabling rapid evaluation of new therapeutic agents, as exemplified below.

exemplification of the methods for evaluation of anticancer agents
evaluation of effects of signaling inhibitors on cell viability in three-dimensional vs two-dimensional cultures
in order to evaluate responsiveness in our suite of tumor spheroid assays, we first compared the sensitivity of cells in three-dimensional vs two-dimensional cultures to selected compounds using the celltiter glo cell viability assay which is quick, easy and reproducible. this was validated in pilot studies that determined optimum incubation time of the reagents, and showed good correlation between spheroid size and luminescent emission as well as spheroid size and the number of viable cells per spheroid .

mda-mb- <dig>  u- <dig> mg, kns <dig> and licr-lon-hn <dig> cells were treated with 17-aag , pi- <dig>  or cct <dig>  in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, and concentrations inhibiting cell viability by 50%  were determined after  <dig> h. tumor cells were generally less sensitive to compounds in three-dimensional than in two-dimensional cultures . mda-mb- <dig> p  cells treated with 17-aag showed a clear shift of the cell survival curve, resulting in a higher gi <dig> in three dimensions . this could reflect reduced compound access or pathophysiological differences in the response of hypoxic or more slowly cycling cells under these conditions . this was not the case with cct <dig> in three dimensions . furthermore, both u- <dig> mg and kns <dig> were more sensitive in three dimensions to pi- <dig>  confirming previous reports of increased sensitivity to pi <dig> kinase inhibitors in three dimensions  <cit> . this highlights the importance of accurately evaluating drug responses under appropriate conditions in vitro in order to avoid overestimating or underestimating the effect of compounds prior to in vivo studies.

cells cultured in two dimensions and three dimensions were treated with compounds for  <dig> h. a celltiter glo® viability assay was performed and gi <dig> values were obtained. values are means ± sd of the studies reported in additional file  <dig> .

tumor spheroid growth inhibition with 17-aag and pi-103
for evaluation of the effects of molecularly targeted agents on three-dimensional tumor growth kinetics, 4-day-old spheroids  were treated with compounds for  <dig> h. medium replenishment and imaging was performed as shown on the schematic protocol in figure 6a. 17-aag and pi- <dig> induced concentration-dependent growth inhibition .

this assay allows dynamic effects of compounds to be measured over time; a significant advantage compared to standard endpoint assays in two dimensions. moreover, it can demonstrate whether a single administration of the agent is sufficient to inhibit spheroid growth or induce 'regression' as shown in figure 6b. note the excellent reproducibility of the spheroids on each plate across the six replicates/conditions  and the gaussian distribution of the spheroid volume that is maintained over the observation period, not only in controls but also in treated u- <dig> mg spheroids . tumor spheroid growth in this system is thus characterized by small standard deviations, which facilitate quantitative analysis and the ability to sensitively discern statistically significant differences between test and control conditions. similar results of dose response inhibition on tumor spheroid growth were obtained with further cell lines, for example, kns <dig> and licr-lon-hn <dig>  treated with pi- <dig> and 17-aag, respectively .

kns <dig>  licr-lon-hn <dig> and u- <dig> mg generate tight spheroids, ideal for fully automated growth kinetic assays. with spheroids of looser morphology, or where agents cause dissociation of the three-dimensional structure, a celigo cytometer still provides fully automated imaging but does not always provide accurate size determination. images can then be imported into image-pro analyzer software and manually manipulated for data analysis . alternatively, if no cytometer is available, images can be obtained using an inverted microscope and analyzed on image-pro analyzer software. the results obtained using both methods are highly comparable; thus the latter is a perfectly acceptable  alternative. two comparative examples are shown in additional file  <dig> for u- <dig> mg and licr-lon-hn <dig> spheroids treated with 17-aag. concentration-dependent inhibition trends are fully reproducible between the two imaging/analysis systems as demonstrated by a head-to-head comparison using licr-lon-hn <dig> .

hsp <dig> and plcγ inhibitors prevent tumor dissemination on matrix protein
the tumor spheroid-based migration assay  was adopted to mimic cell motility mediated by cell-substrate interactions. we previously reported that plcγ <dig> is important in integrin-mediated cell migration  <cit> . to exemplify the power of the assay, we show here that an in-house plcγ inhibitor  reduces the migration of both u- <dig> mg and mda-mb- <dig> tumor cells at sub-gi <dig> concentrations .

hsp <dig> is also involved in tumor cell migration through client proteins including c-met, src and fak  <cit> . the hsp <dig> inhibitor 17-aag potently inhibited migration of u- <dig> mg, kns <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells in a concentration-dependent manner as early as  <dig> h . the fact that inhibitory effects are manifest at low concentrations and short time intervals is of particular importance, indicating selective effects on tumor cell migration at least partly independent of proliferation.

17-aag inhibits three-dimensional tumor spheroid invasion into matrigel
another aspect of tumor progression is the ability of cells to invade basement membranes and connective tissue, enabling escape from the primary tumor and, in some cases, subsequent metastasis. u- <dig> mg glioma spheroids  were embedded in matrigel and treated with 17-aag. tumor cell invasion was monitored up to  <dig> h, although effects of the compound were apparent after just  <dig> h and invasion was inhibited at sub-gi <dig> concentrations . a celigo cytometer was used for a fully automated image analysis  and representative images with the segmentation analysis around the invading cells are shown in figure 8b at the  <dig> h timepoint. additionally, similar results are obtained using the celigo cytometer for automated imaging only, with the analysis performed on image-pro analyzer software as an example of lower throughput . as indicated previously, a non-automated image capture and analysis method  can similarly be applied. this is illustrated by the inhibitory effects of 17-aag on invasion of spheroids formed by highly malignant mda-mb- <dig> m  triple negative breast cancer cells .

discussion
building on the pioneering work of friedrich et al.  <cit>  and others, here we demonstrate a novel method for the rapid generation and quantitative analysis of tumor spheroid growth in ht format, with additional applications in further important aspects of the malignant phenotype. the assays can readily be established in any laboratory without specialized equipment and negate the need to purchase preformed spheroids, which may only be available for a limited number of cell lines. although the quantitation is significantly enhanced by the use of automated cytometry, we have also deliberately exemplified its utility using standard microscopy to broaden its accessibility to the research community.

recent advances in the development of three-dimensional cultures for cancer drug evaluation have focused mainly on methods that avoid cell surface adhesion and promote cell-cell attachment  <cit> . most are based on cellular aggregation on agarose-coated flat-bottomed plates  <cit> , poly-hema-coated round-bottomed or v-bottomed plates  <cit>  or hanging drops  <cit> . although able to generate reproducibly-sized spheroids, all such methods rely on time-consuming procedures or the need to transfer spheroids from delicate hanging drops to plates for further analysis. more recently, advances in microtechnologies have engineered plates for low binding of cells to the surface  <cit> .

in pilot studies we compared different techniques for generating spheroids . we found that the ula 96-well round-bottomed plate method is the least time consuming and generates the most reproducible spheroids. we have carried out a direct comparison with agar-coated plates and demonstrated that the tumor spheroids grown in ula plates have equivalent growth rates, comparable gradients of proliferation and increased hypoxia in older spheroids but in general present a more compact and uniform structure. also ula plate-generated spheroids have the significant advantage that they are ideally suited to automated image analysis using a celigo cytometer. overall, the system  represents an important advancement towards the routine use of three-dimensional cultures for preclinical oncology drug development.

ht three-dimensional growth assays must satisfy several key requirements: large scale, speed, simplicity, reproducibility and automation . here, we demonstrate that combining the use of ultra-low attachment round-bottomed plates with a celigo cytometer, it is possible to utilize three-dimensional tumor spheroid assays in drug discovery projects in ht format. building on this basic growth kinetic assay, we also successfully optimized de novo three-dimensional tumor spheroid-based functional assays in 96-well plates, for relatively ht formats: in situ three-dimensional tumor spheroid invasion into matrigel, migration of cells from tumor spheroids on matrix proteins , and coculture of tumor spheroids with ebs representing tissue invasion with reciprocal angiogenesis.

in contrast to previously reported invasion assays  <cit> , our method avoids the need to move spheroids and allows true three-dimensional invasion rather than superficial interactions between spheroids placed on top of  layers of matrix proteins. in the complementary assays of cell migration and tissue invasion/angiogenesis, preformed tumor spheroids are easily and quickly transferred onto matrix-coated wells or into coculture with ebs , in a single step using multichannel pipettes. our methods significantly accelerate and simplify the assays, but at the same time generate highly reproducible results. furthermore, they combine real-time quantitative kinetic analyses with options for more detailed morphological and molecular investigations: for example, qualitative determinations of modes of cell motility; recovery of spheroids for genetic/phenotypic or pharmacodynamic analyses, target validation using cells in which genes of interest are genetically repressed or mutated.

the assays can easily be modified further according to specific requirements: migration/haptotaxis on different matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, laminin, on endothelial cell monolayers, or  on recently described nanofiber scaffolds  <cit> : invasion into alternative matrixes  or, to avoid animal tissue derivates, fully synthetic biopolymers; microenvironment-enriched spheroids incorporating endothelial cells, immune cells and/or stromal cells  <cit> . the current spheroid-eb coculture is designed to mimic xenograft tumor transplant systems , the mainstay of preclinical drug evaluation studies, but human escs could be substituted to generate a fully human three-dimensional confrontation culture system.

in addition to optimization and streamlining of spheroid generation and a suite of functional assays, we have successfully automated imaging and quantitation of real-time spheroid growth and also invasion using a celigo cytometer. we are currently developing further protocols for fully automated imaging and analysis of the migration and the coculture assays. these, together with the tumor spheroid growth kinetic and viability assays will allow a complete analytical package to bridge the gap between simple two-dimensional proliferation assays and in vivo studies. we are currently using these assays in a number of target validation and cancer drug discovery projects where our data suggest that they have the ability to reflect in vivo activity. once fully validated for a wider range of agents and shown to have predictive value for therapeutic efficacy, we believe such assays will become a mainstay of the preclinical functional tumor assay portfolio and reduce the need for extensive testing in animal tumor models.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide a comprehensive suite of simple, reproducible three-dimensional tumor spheroid models that recapitulate in vitro some of the key hallmarks of cancer and that at the same time can provide a dynamic, automated, quantitative imaging and analysis compatible with high-throughput preclinical studies. we provide evidence that our methods have the potential to enhance target selection through rapid functional screening assays and the effective triaging of drug candidates prior to in vivo studies.
