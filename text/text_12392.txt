BACKGROUND
diabetes is a worldwide epidemic, with the world health organization estimating that more than  <dig> million people have diabetes worldwide http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/index.html, with greater than 90% of those having type  <dig> diabetes mellitus . t2dm is thought to develop as a combination of insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell failure  <cit> . therefore, identification of novel treatments that would increase pancreatic insulin secretion while protecting pancreatic β-cells are of great interest.

incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide- <dig> , are secreted from cells in the gastrointestinal  tract into the circulation in response to nutrient absorption. they are a major component of the mechanism regulating post-prandial insulin secretion when it is needed following meals  <cit> . incretins account for up to 60% of the post-prandial insulin secretion in healthy individuals, but the incretin response is impaired in t2dm  <cit> . incretin effects do not lead to insulin release per se, but potentiate the physiological release of insulin from the pancreas in response to increases in plasma glucose. since glp- <dig> has been shown to have the major incretin effect on glucose homeostasis in patients with type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> , much work has been done to understand the effects of this incretin hormone on normal and pathophysiological glucose homeostasis.

following its secretion, dipeptidylpeptidase- <dig>  rapidly metabolizes the intact form of glp- <dig>  to inactive glp-19- <dig> with a half-life of  <dig> to  <dig> minutes in vivo  <cit> . therefore, two approaches have been taken to increase activity of the incretin axis, parenteral administration of dpp4-resistant glp- <dig> analogues or oral administration of dpp <dig> inhibitors. dpp <dig> inhibitors have minimal risk of hypoglycemia because they enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and glucagon reduction. they are also weight neutral; i.e., they do not promote weight gain that is typically seen with many other anti-diabetic agents. dpp <dig> inhibitors are also effective in combination with several other diabetes drug classes  <cit> . finally, data from animal models indicate that glp- <dig> is a trophic factor for β-cells, and potentiating endogenous incretins with dpp <dig> inhibitors does increase β-cell function and number, thereby contributing to improvement of β-cell function over the long-term  <cit> .

there are many examples of enzyme inhibitors displaying time-dependence , with several becoming marketed drugs, including members of the dpp <dig> inhibitor class  <cit> . in many cases, prolonged pharmacodynamic effects on the target enzyme  confers an advantage over rapidly dissociating compounds, because time-dependent drugs typically require lower plasma levels and reduced drug peak-to-trough ratios, reducing the risk of off-target toxicity  <cit> . in humans, peak glp- <dig> secretion occurs during the first phase of secretion, which occurs rapidly following a meal, giving a 2- to 3-fold increase that lasts  <dig> to  <dig> minutes  <cit> . this can be followed by a prolonged phase that gives a small increase in glp- <dig> levels above fasting levels for up to  <dig> hours [reviewed in  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that if a time-dependent inhibitor has a half-life for dissociation close to the duration of the first phase of glp- <dig> secretion, the majority of the enzyme-inhibitor complex would not dissociate during the release of glp- <dig> and this would maximize the compound's beneficial effects while minimizing plasma drug levels. dpp <dig> also has many other substrates in vitro, although only a few have been shown to be cleaved by dpp <dig> in vivo . therefore, it would be ideal if binding did not extend past the duration of first phase glp- <dig> secretion, such that the inhibitor activity would follow its pharmacokinetics for inhibition of cleavage of other substrates of dpp <dig>  should any such substrates have more prolonged in vivo half-lives relative to glp- <dig> 

here we describe the inhibitory properties of saxagliptin and its 5-hydroxy metabolite, which are both slow binding dpp <dig> inhibitors with extended off-rates from dpp <dig> at 37°c, similar to the duration of the first phase of release of glp- <dig> in vivo. we also use the ex vivo plasma dpp assays that are used in preclinical animal models and the clinic as a biomarker for efficacy, to demonstrate how slow binding compounds such as saxagliptin differ from rapidly dissociating dpp <dig> inhibitors. we show that saxagliptin does not have a dilution artifact or a large dependence on the pseudo-substrate used in the assay, unlike rapidly dissociating dpp <dig> inhibitors, and we discuss the significance of these findings.

RESULTS
saxagliptin is a potent inhibitor of human dpp <dig> in vitro irrespective of substrate
we measured the ic <dig> for inhibition of substrates across a range of substrate concentrations  that straddled the km for the pseudo-substrate gly-pro-pna , and glp- <dig> , then calculated the ki for inhibition of cleavage by each substrate .

each of the dpp <dig> inhibitors tested were equipotent inhibitors of glp- <dig> and gly-pro-pna, as expected for inhibitors that are competitive with substrate and bind in the active site of dpp <dig>  therefore, we used gly-pro-pna as a substrate in subsequent experiments. saxagliptin was approximately 10-fold more potent than vildagliptin or sitagliptin under these conditions at room temperature.

potency and selectivity of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin for human enzymes in vitro at 37°c
routine screening was performed at room temperature. however, as dpp <dig> inhibition in vivo occurs at 37°c, we measured the potency and selectivity of dpp <dig> inhibitors in vitro at that temperature . the km and turnover rate of gly-pro-pna pseudo-substrate for dpp <dig> increased , as did the ki values for inhibition of dpp <dig> by dpp <dig> inhibitors . saxagliptin was 10-fold more potent than either vildagliptin or sitagliptin at 37°c. saxagliptin generates an active metabolite in vivo  <cit> , 5-hydroxysaxagliptin; it was 2-fold less potent than saxagliptin.

the gly-pro-pna pseudo-substrate is not specific to dpp <dig> and is also cleaved by other enzymes, including dpp <dig>  and dpp <dig> , although the cleavage rate of both enzymes is 20-fold lower than dpp <dig>  therefore, we also used this substrate to investigate inhibition of dpp <dig> and dpp <dig> by dpp <dig> inhibitors. saxagliptin is approximately 400-fold selective and 75-fold selective for dpp <dig> versus dpp <dig> and dpp <dig>  respectively, with the 5-hydroxymetabolite having approximately twice the selectivity . in comparison, vildagliptin had 400-fold selectivity for dpp <dig> and 20-fold selectivity for dpp <dig>  while sitagliptin had 1900-fold selectivity for dpp <dig> and 3000-fold selectivity for dpp <dig> 

saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin were tested against multiple other enzymes . both compounds had > 1000-fold selectivity against fap, and > 6000-fold selectivity against dpp <dig> and all other proteases tested: these included neutral endopeptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme, aminopeptidase p, prolidase, prolyl carboxypeptidase, activated protein c, chymotrypsin, factor ixa, factor viia, factor xa, factor xia, factor xiia, plasma kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin, tissue kallikrein, tissue plasminogen activator, trypsin and urokinase . they also had >  <dig> -fold selectivity against a panel of  <dig> unrelated proteins that included  <dig> g-protein coupled receptors,  <dig> nuclear hormone receptors,  <dig> ion channels,  <dig> other enzymes and  <dig> transporters .

the potency and selectivity for all  <dig> compounds for inhibition of cynomolgus monkey  dpp <dig>  dpp <dig> and dpp <dig> is shown in table  <dig> and is very similar to that found versus the human enzymes.

similar data were also obtained for mouse and rat enzymes . therefore, we confirmed that the potency and specificity of saxagliptin and its 5-hydroxymetabolite were similar across species in vitro. we did not investigate the effects of dpp <dig> inhibitors on other peptidases from other species because no effect of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin were seen on the human proteins tested.

saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin are long-acting dpp <dig> inhibitors in vitro
during the course of initial experiments, we noticed that there was time dependence to inhibition of dpp <dig> by some dpp <dig> inhibitors. in order to determine time-dependence, we preincubated dpp <dig> inhibitors with dpp <dig> and measured the rate of dissociation of dpp <dig> inhibitors from dpp <dig> using an 'infinite dilution' method.

the data in table  <dig> show that saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin have slow binding when tested at 37°c, with t1/ <dig> for dissociation of  <dig> minutes and  <dig> minutes, respectively. while vildagliptin shows some evidence of slow binding , this was much less pronounced. sitagliptin showed no time dependence . the time dependence was only found for inhibition of dpp <dig> and was not seen during experiments investigating the inhibition of dpp <dig> and dpp9; therefore, these prolonged effects would only relate to inhibition of cleavage of dpp <dig> substrates by dpp <dig>

saxagliptin does not have a dilution artifact in plasma dpp assays in vitro
the ex vivo assay measuring inhibition of plasma dpp <dig> activity has been used as a key biomarker assay for dpp <dig> inhibitor assessment by multiple groups in both animal models and in the clinic. given that the duration of the ex vivo assay is typically between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes, there would be no dilution artifact predicted for ex vivo determination of inhibition from saxagliptin dosed animals, because negligible dissociation of saxagliptin from dpp <dig> would occur over the time frame of the experiment . to confirm this for saxagliptin, we took naive human plasma and compared samples with just the addition of compound to plasma only, to samples where compound was added to both plasma and buffer .

saxagliptin is unaffected by the 3-fold dilution in the human plasma assay  using ala-pro-afc as substrate. however, sitagliptin clearly has a dilution artifact . when sitagliptin was added only to the plasma, the inhibition curve shifted 3-fold to the right compared to when compound was added to both the plasma and the dilution buffer , except where there is virtually no inhibition or full inhibition, consistent with the 3-fold dilution during substrate addition. this is presumably due to a new equilibrium being rapidly established following dilution, such that the potency of sitagliptin will be underestimated when compound is only present in the plasma. similar data were also obtained using both cynomolgus and rhesus monkey plasma .

maximum inhibition of plasma dpp <dig> activity in plasma samples by dpp <dig> inhibitors differs between species
untreated human plasma samples gave a plasma dpp enzyme activity rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmoles/min per ml plasma  when ala-pro-afc was used as substrate. untreated cynomolgus and rhesus monkey plasma dpp <dig> rates were similar to those seen in human, with rates of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmoles/min per ml plasma, respectively. however, the ability of dpp <dig> inhibitors to inhibit cleaveage of peudo-substrates differs among species. figure  <dig> shows that the maximum inhibition of plasma dpp activity seen with saxagliptin was approximately 85% in rhesus and 80% in cynomolgus monkeys, but > 95% in humans . like human, rodent  and dog plasma dpp is inhibited > 95% by saxagliptin .

these effects were shown to be independent of dpp <dig> inhibitor and similar data were obtained with gly-pro-pna as the pseudo-substrate . since the pseudo-substrates are not specific for dpp <dig>  presumably these findings reflect a species difference in the relative activity of all the other plasma peptidases that cleave these pseudo-substrates.

the in vitro ic <dig> for inhibition of human, rhesus monkey and cynomolgus monkey plasma dpp activity by saxagliptin, vildagliptin and sitagliptin was similar across species . therefore, although there were different amounts of maximal inhibition among species, dpp <dig> inhibitors have similar potency in rhesus monkey, cynomolgus monkey and human plasma for inhibition of plasma dpp activity.

choice of assay affects the ic <dig> measured for inhibition of plasma dpp activity by dpp <dig> inhibitors at steady-state in vitro
the measured ic <dig> varies with the ratio of substrate concentration to substrate km for competitive inhibitors . using the assays described here, km values were calculated as  <dig> ±  <dig> μm  for the ala-pro-afc assay, and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm  for gly-pro-pna assay in human plasma. km values were similar in cynomolgus monkey plasma, at  <dig> ±  <dig> μm  for ala-pro-afc assay and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm  for gly-pro-pna assay. since the majority of dpp <dig> inhibitors are competitive with substrate, a difference in substrate concentration will affect the measured ic <dig> of these inhibitors. in the two pseudo-substrate assays we used to measure inhibition of plasma dpp activity, the ratio of km to substrate concentration is approximately 7-fold in the ala-pro-afc assay , but is only 2-fold in the gly-pro-pna assay . therefore, using gly-pro-pna as substrate would give an apparent increase in potency of dpp <dig> inhibitors compared to ala-pro-afc. further, the difference in temperature  and ph  of the two assays would also affect the measured ic <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the inhibition of cynomolgus monkey plasma dpp activity in vitro for saxagliptin and sitagliptin under pseudo-steady-state conditions. there was a small change in ic <dig> for saxagliptin , with a narrow concentration range over which a difference would be seen between the two assays . this presumably reflects differences in temperature and ph between the two assays. however, at concentrations of sitagliptin between  <dig> and >  <dig> nm, much more inhibition of dpp activity is seen with the gly-pro-pna assay than with the ala-pro-afc assay . further, the ic <dig> for inhibition in the ala-pro-afc assay was significantly increased 26-fold compared to the gly-pro-pna assay, from  <dig> ±  <dig> nm to  <dig> ±  <dig> nm . similar data were obtained using human plasma .

measurement of plasma dpp activity in ex vivo assays
the differences in dissociation rate from dpp <dig> and the substrate used have substantial implications for measurement of activity following dosing in animals and humans. figure  <dig> shows data from an in vivo study where various doses of saxagliptin and sitagliptin were given to cynomolgus monkeys and plasma dpp inhibition was measured after  <dig> hours, at trough.

when the ala-pro-afc assay was used to measure plasma dpp inhibition ex vivo, saxagliptin treatment resulted in close to maximal inhibition of the inhibitable plasma dpp activity at its highest doses, with the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg doses being statistically different from vehicle. however, sitagliptin treatment had no effect on plasma dpp activity at any of the doses. when the gly-pro-pna assay was run on exactly the same samples, similar results were obtained for saxagliptin and there was no statistical difference between the data obtained with either assay at any dose. in contrast to the ala-pro-afc assay, sitagliptin treatment gave statistically significant inhibition of plasma dpp activity at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg doses when compared to vehicle in the gly-pro-pna assay. further, plasma dpp inhibition in the gly-pro-pna assay at the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg doses were statistically significantly different from those obtained using the ala-pro-afc assay . however, the highest dose tested still did not give maximal inhibition of plasma dpp activity. therefore, choice of assay had significant relevance for the interpretation of inhibition by sitagliptin in this study.

discussion
saxagliptin  is a potent inhibitor of dpp <dig> that is approximately 10-fold more potent than vildagliptin or sitagliptin. saxagliptin also has an active metabolite, 5-hydroxysaxagliptin, which is present in human plasma at levels between 2- and 7-fold higher than saxagliptin . 5-hydroxysaxagliptin is 2-fold less potent than saxagliptin, but approximately 5-fold more potent than sitagliptin and vildagliptin.

the data here shows that temperature and the choice of substrate can have significant effects on ic <dig> values, accounting for some of the differences in values typically reported . however, thomas et al.  <cit>  reported very high ic <dig> values for saxagliptin and vildagliptin in particular. in the case of saxagliptin, the value was 50-fold higher than the ki value reported here and 50-fold higher than the value reported for their dpp <dig> inhibitor, linagliptin. saxagliptin  is available commercially in many world markets at doses of  <dig>  mg and  <dig> mg  <cit>  and the minimal efficacious dose of linagliptin is  <dig> mg  <cit> . it is difficult to conceive how saxagliptin could be 50-fold less potent than linagliptin in vitro, but at least equipotent in the clinic; therefore, it seems likely that the data reported here are more accurate determinations of the activity of saxagliptin and vildagliptin. a known concentration of pure dpp <dig> is typically used in the majority of these in vitro studies  because a low concentration of dpp <dig> is important for avoiding obtaining artifactually high inhibition values. part of the reason for the discrepancy may be that thomas et al.  <cit>  are the only group to use "dpp <dig> extracted from caco cell membranes", with dpp <dig> purity and concentration undisclosed.

the increased potency and prolonged binding of saxagliptin compared to sitagliptin and vildagliptin may be a reflection of its strong interactions with both ser <dig> and glu205/glu <dig>  whereas sitagliptin interacts primarily with glu205/glu <dig>  and vildagliptin with ser <dig>  <cit> . further, we showed that saxagliptin demonstrated slow-onset inhibition at room temperature that was partially due to a covalent, but reversible enzyme-adduct formation at ser <dig>  but also partially due to another conformational change induced by saxagliptin  <cit> . both saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin also have slow binding kinetics at 37°c and would be expected to have prolonged pharmacodynamic effects in vivo.

the data in figure  <dig> shows that saxagliptin bound to dpp <dig> prior to substrate addition remained bound during the time course of the ex vivo assay. the half life for dissociation of saxagliptin from dpp <dig>  is similar to the duration of first phase of elevated glp- <dig> in the plasma following a meal in humans  <cit> . this may be relevant to the cleavage of endogenous substrate because saxagliptin  given before a meal will already be bound to dpp <dig> at its site of action. when incretins are released in response to a meal, incretins will increase and compete with inhibitors with rapid off-rates. however, this would be unlikely to occur for saxagliptin, unless substrate concentrations were raised for significantly longer than the duration of the first phase of glp- <dig> secretion, when saxagliptin would equilibrate with substrate as with the other dpp <dig> inhibitors. in clinical practice, dpp <dig> inhibitors currently have a placebo-like side-effect profile in trials up to  <dig> years in length. therefore, rapidly dissociating dpp <dig> inhibitors can be given at high enough doses that any theoretical advantages from extended binding are currently not seen in the clinic. however, the chronic adverse event profiles of current dpp <dig> inhibitors are not yet fully defined and differences between dpp <dig> inhibitors may yet be seen.

saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin are selective for dpp <dig> versus dpp <dig> and dpp <dig> at 37°c. neither saxagliptin nor 5-hydroxysaxagliptin exhibited slow binding kinetics to dpp <dig> or dpp <dig>  so any dpp8/ <dig> related pharmacodynamics would closely match their pharmacokinetics. the potential for inhibition of dpp <dig> and dpp <dig> in vivo is difficult to assess in the absence of a known physiologically relevant substrate and knowledge of the specific tissues and cells where either may play a physiological role. further, as dpp <dig> and dpp <dig> are cytosolic enzymes  <cit> , the cytosolic concentration of saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin in those cells would also be required to accurately predict the potential for inhibition. since this information is unknown , extensive toxicity studies are typically undertaken in several species and adverse events are scrutinized in clinical studies. as discussed previously , the preponderance of evidence for saxagliptin would show that there is no toxicity attributable to inhibition of dpp <dig> or dpp <dig> at clinically relevant doses across species.

there was no significant species difference for potency of inhibition of human and cynomolgus monkey dpp <dig>  dpp <dig>  dpp <dig> or plasma dpp activity for three dpp <dig> inhibitors . however, there were significant differences in the maximum amount of inhibition of plasma dpp activity seen between rhesus and cynomolgus monkey plasma  and the other species tested . this presumably shows a difference between the levels of dipeptidylpeptidases found in the plasma of the two species. the identities of the peptidases that underlie this difference are unknown and were not a focus of these experiments. however, as there was no differentiation between saxagliptin, vildagliptin and sitagliptin, it is unlikely to be attributable to species differences in dpp <dig> or dpp <dig> expression .

based on the data presented here, interpretation of data from ex vivo assays for dpp <dig> inhibitors should be done with caution because the choice of substrate, as well as the nature of the ex vivo assay , can all affect measured efficacy. the difference in plasma dpp inhibition for sitagliptin between these two assays  can be explained by sitagliptin's rapid dissociation and reassociation with the active site of dpp <dig>  due to the difference in the ratio of km to substrate concentration between the two assays, one substrate is less effective at competing out the inhibitor and the inhibitor appears more potent in that assay. consistent with this conclusion was the in vitro data that showed that this issue would most likely manifest itself across the range of plasma concentrations typically found at trough  for sitagliptin in cynomolgus monkeys. in contrast, saxagliptin would not dissociate appreciably from the active site during the time course of the assay and there would be no inhibitor-substrate competition.

krishna et al.  <cit>  recently illustrated the benefits of accelerating drug development using biomarkers with the example of dpp <dig> inhibitors and the plasma dpp <dig> assay. while this approach can be fundamentally useful, some important caveats to this approach have been demonstrated here. the pseudo-substrate gly-pro-pna was used in both clinical assays to determine plasma dpp inhibition for saxagliptin and sitagliptin. however, the conditions are very different: i.e. the substrate concentration is  <dig> μm , with an 11-fold dilution step and  <dig> minute assay duration in the saxagliptin assay  <cit> ; the substrate concentration is  <dig> μm , with a  <dig> -fold dilution step and a  <dig> minute assay duration in the sitagliptin assay  <cit> . the data presented here show that, given the comparably longer duration of the assay, the larger dilution factor and the higher substrate concentration in the saxagliptin clinical assay, it is not possible to perform a meaningful direct comparison between clinical data for the two drugs using these different assays. this may explain why krishna et al.  <cit>  reported that they need 80% inhibition of plasma dpp <dig> activity at trough  to obtain maximal glucose lowering for sitagliptin. however, only 50% to 60% inhibition of plasma dpp activity was seen 24-hours post dose for vildagliptin at the  <dig> mg dose  <cit>  and for saxagliptin at the  <dig> mg dose  <cit> . despite these differences, all the dpp <dig> inhibitors have similar glucose-lowering efficacy in the clinic at those doses, leading neumiller et al.  <cit>  to conclude that "there does not appear to be a compelling advantage of one dpp- <dig> inhibitor over another".

further, saxagliptin is localized to the gi tract when given intra-arterially in animal models  <cit> . holst and deacon  <cit>  proposed that glp- <dig> cleavage in the gi tract is important: therefore, saxagliptin, by virtue of its location in the gi tract, may give rise to total inhibition of glp- <dig> cleavage, while cleavage of another substrate in a different tissue could be unaffected, and the ex vivo plasma dpp assay shows only partial inhibition of dpp <dig>  further, the tissue distribution of all dpp <dig> inhibitors is unlikely to be the same and different dpp <dig> inhibitors may have different effects if there is tissue-specific localization of inhibitor or substrate. thus, the action of a dpp <dig> inhibitor in the relevant tissue can only be approximated by the evaluation of ex vivo plasma dpp activity.

CONCLUSIONS
saxagliptin and its active metabolite are potent, selective inhibitors of dpp <dig>  with prolonged dissociation from its active site. they also demonstrate prolonged inhibition of plasma dpp <dig> ex vivo in animal models, which implies that saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin would continue to inhibit dpp <dig> during rapid increases in endogenous substrates . however, this remains to be demonstrated for a physiologic substrate in vivo.

interpretation of data from ex vivo assays for dpp <dig> inhibitors should be done with caution because the choice of substrate, as well as the nature of the ex vivo assay , can all affect measured efficacy. therefore, while ex vivo plasma dpp assays may be useful as a biomarker for a compound, for the reasons discussed in this paper, clinically relevant efficacy, efficacy for endogenous substrates, or relative efficacy across dpp <dig> inhibitors cannot be predicted solely using a plasma dpp activity assay.
