BACKGROUND
the mammalian semen coagulum proteins are a heterogeneous collection of proteins secreted at very high concentration by the seminal vesicles. there are two homologous semen coagulum proteins, denoted semenogelin i  and semenogelin ii , in most primates  <cit> . duplication of tandem repeats of  <dig> amino acid residues in both semg <dig> and semg <dig> is responsible for most of the size heterogeneity of semenogelin molecules in primates, but the frequent occurrence of premature stop codons is also a contributing factor  <cit> . it has also been reported that the structure of semenogelin molecules can be affected by gene conversion  <cit> .

the murine seminal vesicles secrete six proteins, svs1-svs <dig>  at high concentration  <cit> . it has been shown that the genes of svs2-svs <dig>  and semg <dig> and semg <dig> are homologous, in spite of lacking similarity between their protein products  <cit> . this apparent paradox is explained by rapid evolution of single exon that codes for most of the gene product. the homologous genes are composed of three exons, the first of which encodes the signal peptide and the very first residues of the secreted protein, the second codes for the remainder of the protein and also carries a few 3' non-translated nucleotides, whereas the third exon only has 3' non-translated nucleotides and holds the poly-adenylation signal. sequence comparison shows that the first and last exons are conserved in these genes, whereas the second exon is not  <cit> . differing selection of splice acceptor sites and species unique repeat expansion have been proposed to explain the diversity of the second exon  <cit> .

the proposed evolutionary mechanisms suggest that the seminal vesicle-transcribed genes might be related to genes with similar organization that code for secreted, but structurally very different proteins. this hypothesis led to the discovery that the genes of the elastase inhibitors elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor , and the predominating seminal vesicle-secreted proteins are homologous, in spite of lacking similarity between their protein products  <cit> . elafin and slpi belong to the whey acidic protein four-disulfide core  family of small protease inhibitors, which interacts with cognate proteases by what is known as the standard mechanism, by which the protease-binding loop of the inhibitors interacts with the catalytic site of proteases in a similar way as substrates  <cit> .

with the advent of nucleotide sequences from the human genome project, it became possible to assign the chromosomal location of genes in detail. analysis of the human semenogelin locus on chromosome 20q12- <dig>  showed that pi <dig>  the gene of elafin, and slpi are flanking semg <dig> and semg <dig> and an extended analysis of the chromosomal region identified  <dig> additional, homologous genes encompassing wfdc motif  <cit> . most of the wfdc genes and svs2-svs <dig> are conserved at the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse, which suggests that the semen coagulum proteins probably originate from a wfdc gene  <cit> . many of the wfdc genes are with certain specificity expressed in the epididymis and display accelerated evolution, which might indicate that they are of importance in male reproduction  <cit> .

three of the novel genes with wfdc motifs, wfdc <dig>  spinlw <dig>  and wfdc <dig> also carry the motif of kunitz-type protease inhibitors  <cit> . similar to the wfdc domain, the conserved kunitz domain is present in several proteins that inhibit proteases by the standard mechanism  <cit> . a well-known and much studied example is the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor , also known as aprotinin and until recently marketed as an anti-bleeding drug under the name of trasylol®. kunitz domains are also present in important protease inhibitors, such as the tissue factor pathway inhibitor, which regulates blood coagulation, and the light chain, also known as bikunin, of the multifunctional inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor  <cit> .

we have in several previous studies, as outlined above, demonstrated that many of the genes at the semenogelin/wfdc locus are expressed in the male reproductive tract and display accelerated evolution by a variety of mechanisms. most compelling are the findings suggesting that a wfdc gene gave rise to the genes of the semen coagulum proteins, as it also rises the question whether there could be still more genes at the locus on chromosome  <dig> that have gone through a similar metamorphosis. our finding that the protease inhibitor locus on chromosome  <dig> carries several genes that code for inhibitors containing wfdc motifs only, while other genes encode products containing both wfdc and kunitz motifs, raised the question as to whether there also exists homologous genes encoding putative inhibitors with kunitz motifs alone. in this report, we have searched the locus for novel genes encoding proteins with kunitz motifs. the identified genes have been analyzed with respect to structure, expression and function.

RESULTS
identification of three novel genes encoding kunitz domains
the nucleotide sequence of  <dig>  mb centered on the  <dig>  mb wfdc locus on chromosome 20q <dig>  was translated in  <dig> reading frames and screened for kunitz motifs. a total of six kunitz motifs were detected, three of which were associated with proteins containing both kunitz and wfdc motifs; the previously characterized spinlw <dig>  wfdc <dig> and wfdc <dig>  <cit> . the human wfdc locus consists of two subloci and the six genes encoding kunitz motifs are all located at the telomeric sublocus . the first of the novel genes, spint <dig>  is located  <dig> kb on the telomeric side of wfdc <dig> and  <dig> kb on the centromeric side of wfdc <dig>  we located spint <dig> and spint <dig> next to each other, separated by  <dig> kb of intergenic dna, with spint <dig> located  <dig> kb on the telomeric side of wfdc <dig> and spint <dig>  <dig> kb on the centromeric side of wfdc <dig> 

structure of transcripts
the nucleotide sequences of full-length transcripts of the novel genes were obtained from overlapping sequences generated by 3', and 5' race with cdna from epididymis. the procedure yielded a single transcript for spint <dig>  whereas two transcripts were associated with spint <dig> and presumably three with spint <dig>  all genes give rise to transcripts that encode a kunitz domain preceded by a signal peptide of  <dig> amino acid residues, indicating that the protein products are secreted. there are no signals for n-linked glycosylation in the primary structures, which suggests that the proteins are secreted without carbohydrate chains. sizes of exons and introns are given in table  <dig> 

exons were identified by sequence comparison between transcripts and the reference genomic dna in the ensembl database . race products generating alternative 5' and 3' ends are indicated with alt 5' and alt 3' respectively. overlapping exon and intron sequences are written with bold fonts.

the spint <dig> transcript of  <dig> bp  terminates in a poly-a tail that is preceded by an unconventional poly-adenylation signal, tataaa, which notably is identical to the canonical tata-box sequence in eukaryotic genes . it gives rise to a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues that will be processed to a secreted protein of  <dig>  kda. the gene is not preceded by a conventional tata-box, but there is an a and t rich sequence, taaaat,  <dig> bp upstream to the transcription initiation site.

the two spint <dig> transcripts are  <dig>  and  <dig>  nucleotides respectively. the difference between the transcripts is found in the 3' non-translated part, which in the smaller transcript consists of  <dig> nucleotides that overlap with those in the longer transcript of  <dig> nucleotides . the conventional poly-adenylation signal, aataaa, used in the shorter transcript, is skipped in the longer transcript for an unconventional poly-adenylation signal, aatgaaa, located further downstream. both transcripts give rise to a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues, which is processed to a protein of  <dig>  kda, encompassing a kunitz motif that is lacking the fifth cys of the consensus motif. normally this would yield a free thiol group in the third cys, the binding partner of the fifth cys in the motif. however, there is another cys located upstream to the kunitz motif that potentially can form a disulphide with the third cys of the motif . there is a tata-like sequence, tataac, preceding the gene by  <dig> bp.

it was more difficult to obtain race products from spint <dig> than from the other two novel human kunitz genes, but two transcripts were generated each by 3' race and 5' race when run with nested primers. the amplification problems suggests very low mrna levels and the structures of the transcripts, which include premature stop codon and extensively many 3' non-translated exons, indicated that they might be spurious and not fully processed. therefore, in another set of experiments, the kunitz motif of spint <dig> was identified in silico in the mouse genome. following rt-pcr detection of the transcript in mouse testis, race, with testicular cdna and primers based on the genomic sequence, yielded overlapping dna fragments from which we could determine the complete structure of mouse spint <dig> . the mouse transcript of  <dig> bp is derived from four exons, two of which are located upstream to the exon coding for the kunitz domain . in contrast to the human, the mouse transcript can be translated to yield a pre-protein of  <dig> amino acid residues that contains both a predicted signal peptide and the kunitz domain. removal of the signal peptide gives rise to a secreted protein of  <dig>  kda. the human and mouse transcripts differ with respect to the splicing of the second exon, which is only nine nucleotides in the mouse and codes for three amino acid residues. the splice acceptor site of the mouse transcript is structurally conserved in the human genome and, if used, it could generate a translation product encompassing both a signal peptide and a secreted protein of  <dig>  kda with a kunitz domain .

the race procedure also yielded products for alternative 5' and 3' ends of human spint <dig>  the sequence of a shorter 5' race product overlaps with the human transcript that is orthologous with mouse spint <dig>  but starts three nucleotides downstream of the splice acceptor site of the second exon . this transcript could potentially generate an intracellular kunitz domain, as it is lacking the coding information of the signal peptide. the alternative 3' end is longer and derived from  <dig> exons located 3' to the exon with the kunitz motif.

expression of transcripts in normal human tissues
gene expression was analyzed by rt-pcr using rna from a panel of  <dig> tissue specimens that previously had been screened for genes encoding wfdc domains  <cit> . tissues that generated pcr products with the correct size of spliced transcripts were taken to quantitative analysis using real time pcr. the housekeeping genes cstb and aprt, which were used for normalization of the pcr data, generated transcripts with melting temperatures of 80°c and  <dig> °c and yielded ct values in the range of 23- <dig> and 25- <dig> respectively. spint <dig> and spint <dig> gave rise to transcripts with melting temperatures of  <dig> °c and 74°c and with cdna from epididymis they generated ct values that were similar or slightly lower than those of cstb, but for the remainder of tissues the ct values were  <dig> or higher; in a few tissues transcript was not even detectable. different primer combinations were tested in order to measure the expression of spint <dig>  but a detectable and specific signal was only obtained with a primer pair that primed in the kunitz domain and in the last exon of the transcript; it yielded a ct value of 35- <dig> in the epididymis. the efficacy of the pcr reactions was analyzed by linear regression of ct values generated by serial dilution of epididymal cdna . an efficacy of  <dig> was assumed for spint <dig>  as low levels prohibited analysis of its transcript by linear regression. calculation of the relative expression shows that the level of spint <dig> and spint <dig> transcripts in the epididymis exceeds those in other tissues by more than three orders of magnitude .

the efficiency of pcr experiments was calculated by regression analysis of ct values generated by serial dilution of epididymis cdna.

transcript levels of putative kunitz inhibitors in normal tissues were analyzed by qrt-pcr. the transcript levels were calculated by the comparative ΔΔct method and normalized with the housekeeping genes aprt and cstb. transcript levels are given as % of spint <dig> levels in the epididymis, which was set to 100%. spint <dig> was only detected in the epididymis.

recombinant expression and functional analysis
recombinant expression yielded proteins of around  <dig> kda, which contain the kunitz domains fused to vector encoded thioredoxin. experiments with bpti and bsti, which served as positive controls, yielded around  <dig> mg of recombinant protein from  <dig> l of cultured bacteria after purification on ni-chelate column. the isolated proteins were highly pure and appeared as single bands on sds-page under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. the isolated proteins were functionally active, as demonstrated by the inhibition of trypsin, plasmin and chymotrypsin by approximately equimolar concentrations of bsti or bpti . a comparison with commercially available bpti isolated from bovine pancreas showed that the recombinant protein inhibited chymotrypsin equally well .

experiments with spint <dig> and spint <dig> generated recombinant proteins in yields that were similar to those of bpti and bsti. almost all recombinant spint <dig> was in a monomeric form, whereas this was the case for only a fraction of spint <dig> . repeated experiments to produce recombinant spint <dig> in the same way failed and no recombinant protein could be isolated with the ni-chelate column.

recombinant spint <dig> and spint <dig> were tested on a panel of eight proteases with different specificity, in order to identify target enzymes. the recombinant proteins were tested at different molecular ratios of enzyme and inhibitor, but none of them displayed inhibitory activity towards the proteases in the panel at up to 1000-fold molar excess.

discussion
in this report, we describe the transcripts of three novel genes encoding kunitz motif. they were discovered by analysis of nucleotide sequences from a locus where we previously have identified homologous genes of semen coagulum proteins and putative wfdc-type serine protease inhibitors  <cit> . in earlier studies we have shown that genes of different semen coagulum proteins and wfdc-type protease inhibitors are homologous, in spite of lacking structural similarity of their protein products  <cit> . by and large, these similarly organized genes carry the signal peptide, the secreted protein and 3' non-translated nucleotides on three separate exons. sequence and size conservation of the first and the third exon suggests that the genes are homologous, whereas the second exons, encoding the secreted protein, in most instances display very little sequence conservation. two mechanisms, de novo selection of splice sites and size expansion by duplication of repeats in combination with replication slippage, have been proposed to explain the structural variation of the second exon  <cit> .

the novel genes of putative kunitz inhibitors are organized in a similar way as the semen coagulum and wfdc genes. another characteristic feature of the genes is that the splice acceptor of the second exon always is that of a phase  <dig> exon, which means that it starts with the second nucleotide of the codon. of the novel genes, it is only spint <dig> that has all of the common features, whereas spint <dig> is lacking the third exon similar to wfdc10a and wfdc10b. at a first glance, human spint <dig> might appear to differ from the other genes at the locus, as the structure of the longer 3' race product suggests that it could be transcribed from  <dig> exons. however, the splice form that is orthologous with mouse spint <dig> is very similar organized as spint <dig>  except for the presence of the puzzling small second exon. in spite of the lacking relationship between the protein products, the similarities in gene organization, chromosomal location, and site of expression, suggests that the novel genes with kunitz motif are homologous with genes encoding wfdc-inhibitors and semen coagulum proteins. a kunitz inhibitor within the frame of a wfdc gene could have evolved by exon shuffling that created an intermediate encompassing both a wfdc and a kunitz domain, as is present in spinlw <dig> and wfdc <dig>  a subsequent loss of the wfdc domain in a purifying process would have created a kunitz gene with the same regulatory sequences as the original wfdc gene.

the problems we experienced in generating a full-length transcript of human spint <dig> were probably caused by low levels of transcript in the samples from our tissue panel. furthermore, the in frame stop codon between the signal peptide and the kunitz motif could indicate that the race products were emanating from either a not fully spliced nuclear transcript or a erroneously spliced cytoplasmic transcript. in order to address this, we generated the sequence of mouse spint <dig> and compared it with those of the human transcripts. the failure to detect a mouse equivalent of the alternative human spint <dig> transcripts and the peculiar structure of them, with no coding information for a signal peptide or a 3' non-translated sequence derived from four exons, suggests that they could originate from not fully processed messages or cryptic transcripts generated by accidental transcription of the gene in a tissue where it is not normally expressed. the former could also be the case for the human transcript that is orthologous with the single mouse transcript, where the second exon might not have been fully processed, as it contains an in frame stop codon that prevents translation of the kunitz motif. when the sequence of the second exon was shortened to the corresponding nine nucleotide of its mouse ortholog, the reading frame is kept and a kunitz domain is translated from the third exon. the presence of an appropriately located cag triplet that could function as splice acceptor in exon  <dig> raises the possibility that human spint <dig> could be processed the same way as mouse spint <dig> 

semi-quantitative rt-pcr has previously shown that several of the wfdc genes at the locus on chromosome  <dig> are expressed in many different tissues  <cit> . however, the same study also showed that a number of the genes at the telomeric sublocus, e.g. wfdc <dig>  wfdc <dig>  wfdc10a and wfdc <dig>  are transcribed in the epididymis with certain specificity. epididymal specificity in expression has also been reported for spinlw <dig> and wfdc <dig>  <cit> . in this study it is shown that spint <dig> and spint <dig> are highly specific for the epididymis as well. this conclusion is supported by qpcr that show expression levels in the epididymis that are of the same order of magnitude as for cstb, a housekeeping gene with low to moderately high expression levels. more importantly, the transcript levels of spint <dig> and spint <dig> in the epididymis exceeds those of the same genes in other tissues that were analyzed by more than three orders of magnitude, which suggests that the expression in those tissues might be neglectable. the result is also in line with an earlier study aiming at identification of epididymis-specific genes in the mouse, in which spint <dig> was found to be highly expressed in a narrow segment encompassing distal caput and proximal corpus of epididymis  <cit> .

transcripts of spint <dig> were only detected in the epididymis, but at a level that is at least four orders of magnitude lower than for spint <dig> and spint <dig>  in analogy with the discussion above, the low transcript level would indicate that under normal conditions spint <dig> presumably is of less importance in the tissues that were analyzed in this study. from this follows that spint <dig> probably is expressed either at a relatively rare anatomical site or at a developmental stage that is not covered by this investigation. in ruminants, it has been shown that several proteins with kunitz motifs are expressed and secreted by the conceptus prior to, or at the time of, trophoblast implantation  <cit> . although, there are major differences in the implantation process between ruminants and many other mammals, e.g. in the timing, it is not unlikely that kunitz inhibitors could be expressed at the time of trophoblast implantation also in humans, and one interesting candidate to study would be spint <dig> 

protein domains are building blocks that usually fold to explicit three dimensional structures, which many times have a specific function. the kunitz domain consists of 50- <dig> amino acid residues, six of which are cys that form three disulphide bonds and have characteristic locations in the primary structure. studies on recombinant kunitz domains expressed in e. coli show that proper folding and disulphide formation can be achieved either by directing the recombinant protein to the periplasmic space or by refolding of the protein extracted from inclusion bodies  <cit> . our approach was to express the recombinant protein as a part of a larger fusion product with thioredoxin, that would generate high solubility and support the proper folding of the kunitz domain, and by using the e. coli k- <dig> sub-strain origami, formation of disulphide bonds in the cytoplasm would be favored. studies with recombinant bpti and bsti showed that the proteins isolated from the cytoplasm were almost exclusively in a monomeric state, which suggests correct disulphide formation and folding of the kunitz domain. furthermore, the recombinant inhibitors were as functionally active as bpti isolated from bovine pancreas, something that also indicates that they are correctly folded. expression of spint <dig> yielded an exclusively monomeric protein in a similar way as bpti and bsti, which suggests that the kunitz domain was properly folded. recombinant expression of spint <dig> yields high molecular mass complexes that probably consist of misfolded peptide chains held together by disulphide bonds in an unorganized way, but also a substantial fraction of monomers that presumably are correctly folded. the structure of spint <dig> differs from that of the consensus kunitz domain. the latter contains three conserved disulphide bridges, but in spint <dig> there will only be two, as one cys is missing. the absent disulphide would have linked the c-terminal alpha-helix to one of the beta-strands at the core of the molecule. earlier experiment has shown that the folding of the kunitz domain is only minimally affected by removal of this bridge and would not affect the protease-binding loop that is situated at the opposite side of the molecule  <cit> . the location of a cys amino-terminal to the kunitz domain in spint <dig> suggests that the monomeric form will have either two free thiol groups, or more likely a disulphide bridge between them. the crystal structure of bpti shows that the amino-terminus of the protein is located relatively close to the third cys of the kunitz motif. therefore, it is not unlikely that a disulfide bridge could be formed in spint <dig> without affecting the protease-binding loop, which is located at the other end of the molecule. this would create a strand of  <dig> amino acid residues that links the protein's amino-terminal part to the third cys of the kunitz motif.

despite several attempts, we did not succeed to isolate recombinant spint <dig> from the cytoplasm of origami cells. it is not clear whether the failure was due to inherent instability of the protein product or whether the problems are due to technical problems with our construct, but future studies will presumably give an answer.

the experiments with recombinant bpti demonstrated, not only that the kunitz domain can be correctly folded in origami cells, but also that the fusion product with thioredoxin could be an equally efficient protease inhibitor as bpti isolated from a natural source. it is therefore likely that recombinant spint <dig> and spint <dig> would be functional as well. they were tested by a set of proteolytic enzymes that represent different catalytic specificities, but unfortunately, we did not succeed to identify a target protease. the amino acid residues in bpti that interact with target proteases have been characterized in detail and homologous residues can be identified in other kunitz domains by sequence alignment  <cit> . there are several residues that are important for protease-binding, but those flanking the scissile bond, particularly the residue at the p <dig> position, are vital for the target- protease specificity  <cit> . the probable scissile bonds in spint <dig> and spint <dig> are between gln and thr, and tyr and glu, respectively . one might then have expected both of them to inhibit psa, which has been demonstrated to cleave c-terminal to both gln and tyr in semg <dig> and semg <dig>  <cit> . there was no inhibition and perhaps the interaction with the inhibitor protein was prevented by the kallikrein loop in psa, which restricts the access to the catalytic cleft  <cit> . in chymotrypsin there is no such structure as the kallikrein loop and spint <dig> could be predicted to interact with this enzyme, which cleaves after large hydrophobic residues. under our experimental condition there was no inhibition, which suggests that there is no high affinity interaction between chymotrypsin and spint <dig>  this emphasizes the importance of contact between amino acid residues other than those of the scissile bond, which is nicely shown with the inhibition of chymotrypsin by bpti; the scissile bond in this case is between lys and ala, i.e. residues that would predict specificity for trypsin, but not chymotrypsin. in spite of this, chymotrypsin is inhibited by bpti.

the wfdc genes at the locus on chromosome  <dig> could be important during sperm maturation, as several of them are highly expressed in the epididymis. there is this far no report on target proteases in the epididymis. it has also been speculated that the wfdc genes are important but not fully recognized components, of innate immunity; in which some modulate host response by regulating endogenous pro-inflammatory proteases, such as elastase and cathepsin g, whereas others regulate poorly characterized exogenous proteases used for tissue invasion by microbes  <cit> . the genes expressing kunitz domains could have a similar function. in this report it is shown that spint <dig> and spint <dig> with high specificity are expressed in the epididymis, which suggests a role in the maturation of spermatozoa. an innate immune function can also inferred, as it has been shown that the kunitz domain of spinlw <dig> inhibits elastase and display antibacterial activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have in this report described three genes that produce small secreted proteins, composed of single kunitz domains that are relatively specific for the epididymis. the similar organization, chromosomal location and site of expression, suggests that the novel genes encoding kunitz motifs are homologous with the genes of wfdc-type protease inhibitors and semen coagulum proteins, in spite of lacking similarity in primary structure of their protein products. a likely mechanism, by which the genes could have been formed, include an exon shuffling event, in which the kunitz motif was taken up by a wfdc gene, and a following purifying process, in which the wfdc domain was lost. this would then be the third mechanism, beside de novo selection of splice site and repeat expansion, by which the regulatory frame of a conserved wfdc/semen coagulum gene could generate a new protein product. the restricted expression of the novel genes to the epididymis suggests that the secreted kunitz domains are important in male reproduction. the recombinantly produced proteins are presumably bioactive, as demonstrated with similarly made bpti, but may have a narrower spectrum of inhibition, as indicated by the lacking activity against eight proteases with differing specificity. another possibility is that they have lost the protease inhibiting property, which is typical of kunitz domains, in favor of new hitherto unidentified functions.
