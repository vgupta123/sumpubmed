BACKGROUND
the olfactory neuroepithelium  is a specialized epithelium responsible for the perception of odours and undergoes neurogenesis throughout life in order to cope with damage suffered by being in direct contact with the external environment. it is also an easily accessible source of stem cells for cell therapy, so that the on has become a useful model of neurogenesis  <cit> .

the on is a simple pseudostratified epithelium composed, in a basal to apical organization, of horizontal basal cells, globose basal cells, olfactory sensory neurons , bowman's gland duct cells, microvillar cells and sustentacular cells. underlining the on, the lamina propria is composed of connective tissue, osn axon bundles and respective olfactory ensheathing glia, blood vessels and bowman's glands  <cit> . many studies have involved the identification of the on stem cell and both horizontal basal cells and globose basal cells have been identified as two distinct putative stem cell populations, responsible for giving rise to all the different cell types within the on and having different roles in normal neurogenesis and neuronal replacement after injury  <cit> . in previous studies sustentacular cell endfeet showed expression of the neural stem cell marker, nestin  <cit>  and were likened to radial glial cells. isolated populations of glandular cells were able to proliferate and form olfactory neurospheres  <cit> . this suggests that there are other potential populations of olfactory stem cells within the mouse on.

different models of on degeneration have been used, including the exposure to the solvents zinc sulphate  <cit> , acetone  <cit> , toluene  <cit>  and the anti-thyroid drug, methimazole  <cit> . another approach has been the inhalation of volatile chemicals, such as co <dig> <cit>  and methyl bromide  <cit> . all of these methods rely on a widespread variable degeneration of the on, destroying multiple cell populations, without specifically targeting olfactory stem cells. bulbectomy instead induces a retrograde degeneration of osns but does not allow for axonal re-targeting to the olfactory bulb  <cit> .

in this study, we analysed the effects on neuronal and non-neuronal cells within the on following x-ray irradiation of proliferating olfactory stem cells. neural stem cells are more vulnerable than other cell types to ionizing radiation. it has been shown that ionizing radiation induces apoptosis of proliferating stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat hippocampus  <cit> . x-ray irradiation of young adult rat brain has resulted in apoptosis especially in the subependyma, a region harbouring a population of proliferating neural and glial stem cells  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that x-ray irradiation can specifically target the neural stem cell population in the rat brain subventricular zone  <cit> .

we hypothesize, based upon previous work published by our group, that glandular cells, apically-situated sustentacular cells as well as suspected basal cells will be affected by x-ray irradiation and cause both morphological and behavioural disruption of the mouse on. this study contributes to the understanding of cellular events that occur within several olfactory cell populations after an induced selective damage to the proliferating olfactory stem cell populations.

RESULTS
anaesthetized adult mice were irradiated with a sub-lethal dose of x-rays on the mouse on. the olfactory bulbs  were protected from irradiation by use of a lead shield designed to protect the whole body except the nose snout . experimental groups were as follows: unlesioned control group,  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> week,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks post-x-ray irradiation groups, with all animals injected with brdu  <dig> hours before perfusion. mice were monitored and weighed daily. none of the irradiated mice presented with oral or nasal ulceration, nasal discharge, breathing problems, nose scratching or signs of distress at any level. olfactory behavioural tests were performed as well as on detailed immunohistochemical analysis. due to the complexity and timing of the olfactory behavioural tests, these were not performed for the  <dig> hours group.

morphology of the on and ob post-irradiation
haematoxylin and eosin  staining was performed on both on  and ob and sections analyzed at roughly the same coronal level for each group. for the on,  <dig> areas  were defined for morphological analysis and for posterior detailed immunohistochemical analysis . the gross morphology of the turbinates and nasal septum as discerned using low magnification microscopy was identical for all groups indicating that following irradiation no gross abnormalities occurred within the mouse on  or vomeronasal organ .

we analysed the morphology of the on, ob as well as the nerve fibres connecting them. we studied these structures following staining of βiiitubulin. we showed that in the controls and at all time points following irradiation  βiiitubulin was present in the cell soma of osns, processes and axon bundles in the on . furthermore, at low magnification the βiiitubulin-positive nerve fibres can be seen traversing from the on to the ob in the control as well as the  <dig> hour and  <dig> week groups . higher magnification of the immunohistochemical analysis of βiiitubulin in the ob can be seen in additional file  <dig>  qualitative analysis reveals there was no differential localization in controls or irradiated mice. βiiitubulin labels the cell soma of glomerular and mitral cells as well as the nerve fibres in the untreated and treated mice.

we quantified the number of osns positively stained for βiiitubulin   <cit> , carnosine   <cit>  and olfactory marker protein    <cit>  for all groups. the results showed no significant difference for βiiitubulin , but there is an increase in the number of both carnosine- and omp-positive osns at  <dig> week  in the regions examined. carnosine and omp label more mature osns compared to βiiitubulin which labels only a subpopulation of mature osns  <cit> .

proliferation was abolished immediately following irradiation
for analysis of cell proliferation, three different markers were analyzed: detection of brdu incorporation during the s phase of the cell cycle ; ki <dig>  a marker of cell proliferation at g <dig>  s and g <dig> phases of the cell cycle  and ph <dig>  a marker of mitosis . brdu staining showed a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells at the level of the basal cell layer, which decreased at  <dig> hours and was almost abolished at  <dig> hours. the number of brdu-positive cells returned to half the control level after  <dig> week and remained so up to  <dig> weeks . there was a small proportion of brdu-positive cells within the sustentacular cell layer, which disappeared at  <dig> hours . brdu and keratin, a marker for horizontal basal cells, did not generally co-localize, with most of the brdu-positive cells appearing on top of keratin-positive cells in the globose basal cell layer . still, we did observe some cells positive for both brdu and keratin at  <dig> week, indicating that a small percentage of proliferating cells were indeed horizontal basal cells at least at  <dig> week post-irradiation .

we found an increase in ki67-positive cells in the basal layer of the on at  <dig> hours, which was significantly reduced below normal levels after  <dig> hours . figure 4g,h shows a sustentacular cell and a horizontal basal cell labeled with ki <dig>  respectively. overall there were more ki67-positive cells in the sustentacular cell  layer .

in order to more clearly dissect cell proliferation within the on, we have analyzed also ph <dig>  a specific marker for mitosis. results are in agreement with brdu, in that we have found mitosis at the level of the basal lamina, showing a reduction at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours, with values returning almost to normal after  <dig> week . positive cells were seen also at the sustentacular cell layer at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks , indicating an increase in mitosis in both the basal and apical layers following irradiation. there were also a few ph3-positive cells within the lamina propria at  <dig> weeks .

the overall analysis of proliferation markers shows a significant reduction in olfactory progenitor cell proliferation following x-ray irradiation, which is almost abolished after  <dig> hours, and returning to normal levels after  <dig> weeks.

x-ray irradiation did not induce apoptosis in the on
apoptotic cells were quantified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick end labeling , which measured fragmented dna by incorporating fluorescein-12-dutp at 3'-oh dna ends, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme. apoptotic cells were quantified separately at the level of the basal, intermediate and sustentacular cell layers and we saw a significantly higher number of apoptotic cells within the basal and intermediate cell layers of the on . this distribution was roughly the same for irradiated and non-irradiated groups. when the total number of apoptotic nuclei throughout the on was quantified, we did not observe an increase in apoptosis. instead, we observed a significant decrease in apoptosis  <dig> hours post-irradiation .

anatomical morphology of the basal lamina post-irradiation
we noticed a significant disruption of the basal lamina starting  <dig> week post-irradiation, as seen by keratin-positive horizontal basal cells that line the basal lamina , compared to the controls . these areas did not present an increase in brdu incorporation, showing there was no increase in proliferation where the basal lamina was disrupted . when analyzing the position of the osns as indicated by βiiitubulin staining the basal lamina was not disrupted at  <dig> hours but was disrupted at  <dig> weeks where osns can be seen below the basal lamina in a pouch-like configuration within the lamina propria where βiiitubulin-positive axon bundles  and gfap-positive ensheathing cells  are evident .

migration of glandular cells post-irradiation
cd <dig> labels duct cells of the bowman's gland in the on and acinus cells in the lamina propria . importantly, cd <dig> expression was seen apically in the mucous layer of the on . at  <dig> hours cd <dig> expression was absent from the mucosal layer , faint at  <dig> week  and returning to normal levels  <dig> weeks following irradiation . this result indicates involvement of bowman's glands following irradiation.

moreover we saw many cd15-positive cells in between the lamina propria and the on where they do not normally appear . not all areas where the basal lamina was disrupted had cd15-positive cells and not all the cells in a single disrupted region were cd15-positive.

expression of neuronal transcription factors post-irradiation
we observed a statistically significant increase in both mash <dig>  and pax <dig>  expression in the mouse on following irradiation, with a peak at  <dig> hours. mash <dig> expression was seen in the nuclei of sustentacular cells and osns throughout the on . pax <dig> nuclear expression was seen throughout the on in the basal layer as well as the neuronal layer and the sustentacular cell layer . the areas of the on where pax <dig> expression patterns were effected by irradiation was most evident in the bowl-like areas . at  <dig> hours post-irradiation where there was an increase in expression of mash <dig> and pax <dig>  with more nuclear staining evident in cells within the sustentacular cell layer of the on at this time point . quantification of numbers of cells labeled with mash <dig> and pax <dig> was represented as the total number cells in the on and not separately into specific cell types.

x-ray irradiation of the nose disrupts olfactory function
to assess the olfactory function following x-ray irradiation of the mouse nose, two olfactory tests were performed: the buried food pellet and the habituation/dishabituation test at  <dig> hours,  <dig> week,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks . the buried food pellet measures the mouse's ability to find a buried piece of food using olfactory cues. the habituation/dishabituation test assesses the mouse’s ability to discriminate between different odours. a decrement in the amount of time the mouse spends with its nose to the odour is inferred to signal its ability to habituate to a repeatedly exposed odour. the increase in time exploring a new odour is interpreted to reflect dishabituation. irradiated mice had no detectable change in behaviour with respect to controls either during their time in the home cage or during behavioural testing.

results for the buried food pellet test  show a statistically significant difference between groups, as determined by one-way anova. in particular, mice spent significantly more time to find the buried food pellet  <dig> hours post-irradiation, with respect to control group , indicating an impairment in the olfactory function at this time point. moreover, there seems to be a trend to return to normal values, as seen  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks post-irradiation.

for the habituation/dishabituation test, we measured two different odours: strawberry and coconut . for strawberry , we did not see a significant difference after  <dig> hours but only after  <dig> week , and this impairment was maintained up to  <dig> weeks. instead, for coconut , we saw a significant impairment in identifying this odour as new at  <dig> hours . moreover, this impairment recovered over time, as seen after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks. overall, performances in both tests demonstrate a significant impairment in the olfactory function following x-ray irradiation of the nose.

discussion
following x-ray irradiation, we observed an overall decrease in cell proliferation at  <dig> hours, a complete abolition of mitosis at  <dig> and  <dig> hours and a decrease in apoptosis at  <dig> hours. these data seem to indicate that the on, and especially the active cycling zone of the on, the basal lamina, has suffered a cell cycle arrest immediately after and as a consequence of ionizing radiation. x-ray irradiation has been shown before to induce permanent cell cycle arrest and the exhibition of senescence-like phenotypes in normal human cells  <cit>  and to induce senescence in adult human mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . we do not believe these cells have entered senescence, a process in which cells permanently stop dividing and that can happen after dna damage following x-ray irradiation, because both proliferation and apoptosis tend to return to normal levels after 2– <dig> weeks. we believe these cells have entered a reversible cell cycle arrest triggered by ionizing radiation-induced dna damage, from which they recover after only 1– <dig> weeks, confirming the plasticity of the on. following x-ray irradiation, there are variations in radiation sensitivity of neural stem and progenitor populations in the developing mouse brain  <cit> . this radiation sensitivity applies to cell proliferation and apoptosis. x-ray irradiation of the adult mouse nose did not cause increased cell death at any time points post-irradiation.  <dig> gy of x-rays  caused a significant increase in the numbers of apoptotic nuclei in the dentate subgranular zone following x-ray exposure to the brains of mice  <cit> . a single  <dig> gy dose of irradiation caused an increase in apoptosis within the subventricular zone however, no apoptosis was observed in other brain regions  <cit> . therefore different regions of the mouse central nervous system have varying levels of sensitivity to irradiation with respect to both the proliferation of neural precursors as well as cell death.

contrary to other models of on degeneration, which result in high morphological alterations and overall degeneration of the on, our model seems to target specifically the proliferating cell populations, with minor morphological changes. we have found a disruption of the basal lamina at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks post-irradiation, but the overall gross morphology of the on remained unaltered.

as expected, for all groups, the changes in proliferation and apoptosis mostly occurred in the basal lamina, indicating that this area is indeed actively cycling. this area is historically considered the locus for olfactory stem cells in the on and the only zone for cell proliferation. our results have also shown that apical sustentacular cells undergo proliferation and apoptosis. following x-ray irradiation, there are greater numbers of cells in the apical layer of the on expressing ki <dig> compared to brdu. it has been shown before that nestin, an intermediate filament protein expressed in progenitor cells of the neural lineage, in the on is mainly expressed by endfeet and inferior processes of sustentacular cells  <cit> . it has also been shown that during mouse on development, in particular at e <dig> , there are two populations of dividing progenitors, located respectively on the apical and basal sides of the on  <cit> . the proportion of basal progenitors then increases progressively, as development of the on proceeds, and that of apical progenitors decreases  <cit> . it has been suggested that these apical progenitors, which express mash <dig>  would give rise to more mature progenitors that migrate basally  <cit> . others have shown that apical progenitors also express the transcription factors six <dig> and hes <dig>  <cit>  and that they may be progenitors for sustentacular cells. it could be that different genes regulate neurogenesis differently during embryonic and established neurogenesis  <cit> . the endfoot of the sustentacular cell is adjacent to the basal lamina of the on. we have shown that the basal lamina is disrupted following x-ray irradiation. it is possible that this process causes the sustentacular cell to undergo morphological changes. a study of the human on showed that nestin expression in sustentacular cells was related to olfactory function however, olfactory impairment was not connected with abnormalities at the basal cell level  <cit> . overall, it seems that there might be indeed a role for sustentacular cells that is more complex that presently believed.

cd15-positive olfactory glandular cells migrate from the lamina propria into the basal layer of the on corresponding to a severe disruption in the basal lamina at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks post-x-ray irradiation. a previous study showed that degeneration of the on during normal aging spatially co-localizes with lesions in the bowman's gland in the mouse olfactory mucosa  <cit> . we have observed activation/migration of cd15-positive glandular cells coinciding with an increase in olfactory neuron markers , an increase in cell proliferation and an overall surge of activation/regeneration in the on. cd <dig> is considered a marker for glandular cells but it has been shown previously to label adult neural stem cells  <cit> . the previous demonstration that olfactory cell populations marked by cd <dig> give rise to neurospheres  <cit> , indicates that glandular cells marked by cd <dig> might have neurogenic potential. it has been proposed that there is a mesenchymal stem cell population in the lamina propria, which is able to cross to the on  <cit> . the disruption of the basal lamina and the opportunity for cd15-positive glandular cell to migrate across the basal lamina as a consequence of x-ray irradiation, leads us to hypothesize that there may be a fluidic interaction between bowman's gland in the lamina propria and the on.

mash <dig> is a transcription factor involved in neurogenic cell fate  <cit> , and is necessary for the differentiation of osns in the on  <cit> . pax <dig> is a transcription factor expressed in embryonic and adult stem cells and involved in determination of neurogenic cell fate  <cit> . in the olfactory system pax <dig> has been shown to be involved in the development of olfactory supporting cells  <cit> . both mash <dig> and pax <dig> were expressed in cells throughout the on . the numbers of pax6- and mash1-positive nuclei are at their highest levels  <dig> hours post-irradiation and then decline from 1– <dig> weeks post-irradiation. this increase in transcription factors subsequently led to a greater number of mature osns  <dig> week post-irradiation. we know from previous experiments that an increase in the numbers of mash1-positive cells followed a reduction in osns after bulbectomy  <cit> . following methyl bromide lesion, expression of the transcription factor p <dig> is no longer evident in horizontal basal cells  <cit> . it is re-expressed  <dig> days post-lesion and by  <dig> days post-lesion, orns are evident  <cit> . however, another cue for regulating transcription factors is driven by the apoptosis of olfactory precursors. over expression of the apoptosis signaling regulating kinase- <dig>  in adult hippocampus-derived progenitor cells activated the mash <dig> promoter  <cit> .

x-ray irradiation has undoubtedly resulted in impairment in the olfactory function, measured by both the buried food pellet test and the habituation/dishabituation test. it is evident at  <dig> hours post-irradiation that there is olfactory impairment. as olfactory bulbs were protected by a lead shield during irradiation, we do not think the olfactory impairment is due to a deficit in olfactory bulb function, osn signaling via axons or odorant detection by olfactory neuron cilia. the examination of βiiitubulin expression in the cell soma, nerve fibres and cilia of osns in the on and the nerve fibres, glomerular and mitral cells of the bulbs showed no change following irradiation. previous studies have shown that βiiitubulin forms microtubules that form neurites  <cit>  and that it is specific for the cilia, dendrites, somata and axons of osns  <cit> . following axonal degeneration caused by bulbectomy in the rat, βiiitubulin expression is lost in osns  <cit> . this did not occur in our irradiated mice. in the habituation/dishabituation test one of the odours  could still be identified after  <dig> hours and impairment for this odour was only seen  <dig> week post-irradiation. the repertoire of osns in the mouse on is highly complex  <cit> , so that the identification of each odour probably relies on the use of distinct or partially distinct osn families, differently affected by our irradiation protocol. the buried food pellet test relies on the animal’s natural tendency to use olfactory cues for foraging whereas the habituation/dishabituation test relies on the animal’s tendency to investigate novel smells and discriminate between different odours. the irradiation of the on led to an immediate disruption of olfactory responses. detection of general odorants by the vomeronasal organ has been reported  <cit> . examination of the vomeronasal organs of the irradiated mice compared to the control group showed no histological aberrations. therefore we do not attribute the loss of olfactory function to a defect in the vomeronasal organs of irradiated mice. however, we were able to show that the mucous layer as shown by cd <dig> expression was absent at  <dig> hours post-irradiation. nagashima & touhara  <cit>  demonstrated that enzyme inhibitors in the mucosa cause the enzymatic conversion of odours fast enough to affect recognition of the odorant at the levels of the osns. therefore, following x-ray irradiation the detection and discrimination of odours is affected by the differential presence of nasal mucous.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated that x-ray irradiation of the on induces a reversible cell cycle arrest in the on as well as a series of transcriptional alterations and a disruption of olfactory function which are mostly recovered  <dig> weeks post-irradiation. coincident with changes to the basal lamina and basally situated olfactory stem cell populations, the sustentacular and glandular cells of the on were shown for the first time to respond to irradiation by undergoing anatomical and spatial alterations. this study extends the understanding of on plasticity and chemosensory function to include the role of olfactory supporting cells. moreover, it might impact on the understanding of the effects on proliferating cells of ionizing radiation, which is commonly used in computed tomography scans, cancer radiotherapy and nuclear medicine.
