BACKGROUND
the number of globin families has grown markedly since the 1970's, when they were limited to the α- and β-globins and mbs, mostly of vertebrates, and the shbs  of legume plants  <cit> . the ensuing years brought to light several new globins: shbs in plants other than legumes, nshbs in a wide variety of plants  <cit> , and fhbs, chimeric proteins  comprising an n-terminal globin domain and a c-terminal fad- and nad-binding domain, related to the ferredoxin-nadp+ reductases, found in e. coli  <cit>  and in yeasts  <cit> . concurrently, "truncated" globins, sequences shorter than normal , were discovered in protozoa  <cit> , cyanobacteria  <cit> , a nemertean  <cit> , and bacteria  <cit> . globins longer than normal , similar to the "truncated" hbs, were observed in a green alga  <cit>  and in plants  <cit> . the crystal structures of several "truncated" hbs showed them to have a novel 2-over- <dig> α-helical fold instead of the canonical 3-over- <dig> α-helical fold, with an abbreviated a helix, a decreased ce interhelical region and most of the f helix occurring as a loop  <cit> . consequently, we advocate using 2/ <dig> hb instead of "truncated", to indicate the distinctive secondary structure of this group of globins and to bring order to the chaotic terminology in the existing databases, where "truncated", "cyanobacterial", "protozoan" and "2-over-2" are all in current use.

the utilization of molecular biological techniques allowed the detection of globins in organisms where their presence was unsuspected, such as the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and in other nematodes  <cit> , the dipteran drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and the urochordate ciona intestinalis  <cit> . the recent, rapid accumulation of genomic information has resulted in a substantial increase in newly recognized globins. this list includes the ngbs  <cit>  and cygbs  <cit> , which are believed to occur in all vertebrates from humans to birds and fish  <cit> , gbe, the eye-specific globin in the domestic chicken gallus gallus, related to cygb  <cit> , and gbx, a new and fifth type of globin gene in fish and amphibians, thought to have been lost in the higher vertebrates  <cit> . fhbs were found in a variety of bacterial groups  <cit>  together with sdgbs, which align with the fhb globin domains  <cit> . furthermore, globin coupled sensor proteins, chimeric two-domain gene regulators  comprising an n-terminal globin domain, were discovered in an archaean and several bacterial groups  <cit> . lastly, "protoglobins"  related to the former, were found in archaea and in several bacteria  <cit>  and proposed to represent the "ancestral" globin.

RESULTS
overview
the  <dig> bacterial,  <dig> archaeal and  <dig> eukaryote genomes, and the identified known and putative globins, are listed in supplemental data tables 1– <dig> . an alignment of the sequences is provided in supplemental data fig.  <dig> . all the globins identified in our survey can be assigned to two general classes: single chain globins and globin domains within chimeric proteins. the former group comprises the vertebrate α- and β-globins, mbs, ngbs and cygbs, the metazoan intra- and extracellular hbs , the plant shbs and nshbs, the ~195aa pgbs and the 2/ <dig> hbs. the two groups of chimeric proteins, which generally have an n-terminal globin domain, are the ~400aa fhbs with an nad and fad-binding c-terminal domain, and the gcss with highly variable  c-terminal domains. thus, all globins belong to one of three globin lineages: the 3/ <dig> fhbs and sdgbs , the 3/ <dig> gcss and pgbs and the 2/ <dig> sdgbs  <cit> . fig.  <dig> provides the number of genomes that have globins and illustrates a key result: only one of the three globin lineages, the 2/ <dig> hbs, are represented in all three kingdoms of life. fig.  <dig> shows the approximate phylogenetic relationships between the main groups of the three kingdoms of life based on baldauf et al.  <cit>  and depicts the phylogenomic profile of globins.

it should be emphasized, that the presence of putative globins inferred using superfamily and blastp and psiblast searches of the genbank database, does not require having a completed genome. on the other hand, the absence of a globin is certain only when a complete genome is searched and no sequence is found.

archaea
bacteria
alignment of bacterial 2/ <dig> hb sequences indicates that they can be divided into three separate classes  <cit> . the length of the 2/ <dig> hbs varies from 118aa for the cyanobacterium nostoc  to 260aa in streptomyces avermitilis , with the majority  being <140aa. examination of coexistence of the three classes of 2/ <dig> hbs  shows an interesting trend: although only the alphaproteobacterium hyphomonas neptunium has both  <dig> and  <dig> and two have all three classes,  <dig> genomes have classes  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> have classes  <dig> and  <dig>  these results suggest that the class  <dig> and  <dig> 2/ <dig> hbs are derived from the class  <dig> 2/ <dig> hbs, as pointed out very recently by vuletich and lecomte  <cit> .

the finding of an fhb in e. coli  <cit>  led to the discovery of some  <dig> bacterial fhbs  <cit> ; currently, the number is over  <dig> . r. poole and his group  <cit>  and frey and kallio  <cit>  were the first to point out the similarity between the fhb globin domains, the first bacterial hb to be sequenced, that of vitreoscilla stercoraria  <cit> , and several other sd bacterial globins. we now have a total of  <dig> sdgbs in  <dig> genomes. the crystal structures of the p. aeruginosa   <cit>  and vitreoscilla stercoraria   <cit> , show them to be very similar to the globin domains of the fhbs from e. coli   <cit>  and ralstonia  eutropha  , thermobifida fusca zp_ <dig>  and thermosynechococcus elongatus np_ <dig>   <cit> . blastp searches found an additional two dozen gcss, and pgbs in thermus thermophilus yp_ <dig>  and the actinobacterium rubrobacter xylanophilus zp_ <dig>   <cit> . the recent crystal structure of b. subtilis gcs shows it to have a 3/ <dig> fold  <cit> .

the genomes with the largest number of globins,  <dig> to  <dig>  are all from the alpha- and betaproteobacteria; they do include however, redundant sequences. the following have all three lineages of globins:burkholderia fungorum , chromobacterium violaceum , novosphingobium aromaticivorans  and silicibacter sp.tm <dig> , each with  <dig> globins, the three bordetella species , exiguobacterum sp.255– <dig> , shewanella baltica , sinorhizobium meliloti and thermobifida fusca , each with  <dig> globins, and azotobacter vinelandii , all the bacillus species   and geobacillus kaustophilus , each with  <dig> globins. at the other end of the scale, the smallest genome  to have a globin, a 2/ <dig> hb <dig>  is that of the marine alphaproteobacterium pelagibacter ubiques , followed by aquifex aeolicus , and the epsilonbacterium campylobacter jejuni , with one  and two  globins, respectively.

the bacterial divisions represented by  <dig> or more genomes, rank in the following order of having globins: betaproteobacteria – 92%  > actinobacteria – 85%  > gammaproteobacteria – 76%  > alphaproteobacteria – 69%  > cyanobacteria – 58%  > firmicutes – 49% . overall,  <dig> of the  <dig>  bacterial genomes have globins and the number of globins varies from  <dig> to  <dig> 

fig.  <dig> depicts the size distribution of bacterial genomes lacking globins  and comprising globins ; the stippled columns represent the genomes associated with a host . although the two distributions overlap, it is evident that presence of globins is correlated with genome size and that the majority of genomes lacking globins are host associated. table  <dig> shows the mean genome size for completed genomes lacking globin and with one or more globins. the mean size of the genomes shows a positive correlation with the number of globins present. about 80%  of genomes < <dig>  mbp lack globins . very small genomes are characteristic of bacteria with lifestyles characterized by continuous association with a host  <cit> . the majority of the bacteria whose genomes have been sequenced, are human, animal and plant infectious agents. thus, it is likely that the estimate of approximately two thirds of all bacteria having globins obtained in the present study, is on the low side.

eukaryotes
the globins identified in eukaryote genomes are listed in supplemental data tables 4– <dig> . the globins listed for the vertebrate genomes, danio  rerio, fugu  rubripes, gallus gallus, homo sapiens, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus and xenopus tropicalis, include the familiar α- and β-globins and mb, as well as the recently discovered ngbs  <cit>  and cygbs  <cit> . a recent addition to human α-globins is μ-globin  which appears to be very similar to the avian α-d globin  <cit> . in addition, an eye-specific globin, gbe, was found in gallus gallus  <cit>  and a new globin, gbx, was discovered in the fish, bird and amphibian genomes  <cit> . curiously, no mb-like sequence was found in either xenopus tropicalis or x. laevis. the zebrafish danio rerio has  <dig> embryonic globins  <cit> , three α and three β- only  <dig> are listed in the genbank. the pufferfish fugu rubripes, appears to have four α-globin chains  <cit> ; only three of them are listed in the genbank.

the four globins found in the genome of the urochordate ciona intestinalis , have been identified earlier  <cit> . this important finding corrects the erroneous claim of total absence of globins in the report of the genome  <cit> .

at least one putative globin  was found in the recently completed genome assembly of the echinoderm strongylocentrotus purpuratus . used as query in blastp searches it hits the glbxs and cygbs of fish, and other vertebrate cygbs, before recognizing the coelomic globin  of a fellow echinoderm, the holothurian caudina arenicola.

there appear to be  <dig> putative globins in anopheles gambiae: gi|55246163| eaa <dig>  , gi|31201271|xp_ <dig> , gi|31198253|xp_ <dig>  and gi|57914327|xp_ <dig> . their alignment shows that the first three are closely related, sharing essentially identical globin domains: gi| <dig> has an 18aa deletion in the bc helix and the cd corner, while gi| <dig> lacks part of the g and all of the h helices. thus, it is likely that gi| <dig> and gi| <dig> are the only stable globins. the c-terminal 115aa globin domain of gi| <dig> is reminiscent of the mb gene sequence from the antarctic icefish champsocephalus esox  that does not appear to be expressed  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the n-terminal domain of gi| <dig> stabilizes it enough to be expressed.

at least  <dig> putative globins and globin domains were identified in caenorhabditis elegans, together with their orthologs in c. briggsae  <cit> : they are listed in supplemental data table  <dig> ; their alignment is provided in supplemental data fig.  <dig> . several c. elegans/c. briggsae orthologs have unusually long interhelical inserts between the g and h helices: 40aa in ce01012/cbp03870) , 21aa in ce <dig>  , 22aa in ce34964/cbp <dig>  and 21aa in ce34658/cbp <dig> . although three pairs, ce17437/cbp <dig>  ce04582/cbp <dig> and ce35828/cbp <dig>  have n-terminal globin domains, several have c-terminal domains: ce03523/cbp <dig>  ce04843/cbp <dig>  ce05316/cbp <dig>  ce12774/cbp21478), ce36044/cbp02078), ce29586/cbp <dig>  ce30683/cbp <dig> and ce31132/cbp <dig>  the n-terminal portion of the latter is identified as a g protein-coupled receptor-like domain with  <dig> putative transmembrane helices . the nonglobin domains in the remaining proteins could not be identified via blastp searches.

although globin genes were thought to be absent in the genome of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , the presence of at least one  has been demonstrated unequivocally by burmester and hankeln  <cit> . there appear to be two more putative globins, cg <dig>  and cg <dig> ; both provide acceptable alignments. three putative globins are also found in d. pseudoobscura, eal <dig> , eal <dig>  and eal  <dig>   <cit> , and appear to be orthologs of d. melanogaster cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  respectively. although the d. pseudoobscura eal <dig> and eal <dig> are scored by fugue as certainly globins , the former lacks an appropriate f <dig> his residue and the latter appears to be missing the a helix. psiblast searches show that the ortholog pairs cg15180/eal <dig> and cg14675/eal28094) recognize each other but not the cg9734/eal <dig> pair, and also recognize the anopheles globins , together with distant recognition of echinoderm globins and vertebrate β-globins. the cg9734/eal <dig> pair hits the other known insect globins , the vertebrate cygbs and the arthropod multidomain hbs.

three of the four arabidopsis thaliana sequences, glbs 1– <dig> have been identified earlier  <cit> : glb <dig> and glb <dig> are nshbs and glb <dig> is a 2/2hb. a 693aa protein  was found to have an n-terminal 2/2hb domain, with the first 138aa , identical to glb <dig>  although the ~500aa c-terminal portion does not correspond to any known protein domain, a blastp search using it as query found an identical sequence in the n-terminal portion of the 2154aa protein tebichi . both proteins share the same region on arabidopsis chromosome  <dig> and tebichi has a helicase domain at 490–890aa and a polymerase domain at 1700–2150aa; furthermore, this n-terminal portion is missing in animal homologues of teb protein, mus308/polq .

the genome of oryza sativa contains the four nshbs identified by arredondo-peter et al.  <cit> , a 172aa 2/2hb  and a 145aa globin . a blastp search identified the latter as another nshbs.

several putative globins occur in the genome of the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and two larger sequences,  <dig>   with one n-terminal globin-like domain, and  <dig>   with two consecutive n-terminal globin domains. two globins were found in the genome of the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum: ptmm <dig> and  <dig>  two globins occur in the genome of another diatom thalassiosira pseudonana, scaffold_ <dig>  and scaffold_ <dig> , and a single 185aa globin, cmr319c, in the genome of the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae. blastp searches identified all the c. reinhardtii globins, the phaeodactylum ptmm  <dig> and the thalassiosira scaffold_ <dig> as 2/ <dig> hbs, and the cyanidioschyzon cmr319c,phaeodactylum ptmm  <dig> and thalassiosira scaffold_ <dig> as sdgbs, closely related to the bacterial and fungal fhbs and the bacterial sdgbs.

the globins present in the fungi are listed in supplemental data table  <dig> . all the recently completed fungal genomes, which belong overwhelmingly to the ascomycota , have fhbs;  <dig> have two to four fhbs, probably due to genome duplication  <cit> . in addition to saccharomyces cerevisiae np_ <dig>  which was known to have a central globin domain  <cit> , we found an additional  <dig> fhbs to have globin domains within the central portion of their sequences. all belong to the saccharomycotina: candida albicans eak <dig> , candida glabrata xp_ <dig> , eremothecium  gossypii np_ <dig> , kluyveromyces lactis xp_ <dig> , kluyveromyces waltii kwal_ <dig>  kwal_ <dig>  and kwal_ <dig> , saccharomyces bayanus orfp: <dig>  saccharomyces mikatae orfp: <dig> , saccharomyces paradoxus orfp: <dig>  and yarrowia lipolytica xp_ <dig>  and xp_ <dig> . although the globin domains align well with the other fhbs, the n- and c-terminal portions do not recognize the c-terminal moieties of the other fungal and bacterial fhbs or any other known protein, as found earlier for the s. cerevisiae fhb  <cit> . surprisingly, the percent identities between the cdfhbs and the fungal and bacterial fhb globin domains is about 40% and 30%, respectively.

among the lower eukaryotes, the diplomonad giardia lamblia has one fhb  <cit>  and the mycetozoan dictyostelium discoideum has two  <cit> . the giardia sequence has a 21aa insert between helices e and f.

no globin genes appear to exist in the genomes of the apicomplexans entamoeba histolytica and plasmodium falciparum, as well as the microsporidian encephalitozoon cuniculi and the euglenazoan trypanosoma brucei. although a plasmodium bergei globin-like protein of 228aa  is listed in the genbank, it is probably an artefact, since when used as a query in blastp searches, it hits only vertebrate β- and α-globins.

compared to archaea and bacteria, the fraction of eukaryote genomes with globins is much higher, over 90%. although all vertebrates have hb and mb and probably ngb and cygb as well  <cit> , the antarctic icefish belonging to the family channichthyidae do not express hb  <cit> . furthermore, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> icefish species also do not express mb  <cit> . the lack of hb is due apparently to deletion of the β-globin gene  <cit> , which occurred during the last  <dig> to  <dig> myr, the approximate date of divergence of the notothenioid lineage including the channichthyidae  <cit> . in contrst, the lack of mb appears to be due to errors in mb gene transcription  <cit> . it is not known whether the icefish have ngbs and/or cygbs. in the remaining two chordate phyla, the urochordate ciona has  <dig> globins , which when used as queries in psiblast searches, recognize the vertebrate globins and the eukaryote and bacterial fhbs and sdgbs. the report of a hb in the notochord of the cephalochordate amphioxus   <cit> , suggests that globins are present in all chordates. among the remaining deuterostome phyla, intracellular hbs have been reported in two of the  <dig> classes of echinoderms  <cit> , and we find a putative globin in the recent assembly of the genome from the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus, which belongs to another class. no globins have been reported so far in hemichordates.

among the remaining metazoans, direct visual observation of hbs is highly episodic among the metazoans, and varies from total absence of hb in porifera and cnidaria, to frequent presence in some nematode and platyhelminth groups  <cit> . in the largest metazoan group, the insects, of which about  <dig>  species have been described, and which outnumber the combined total of all other animal species, with estimates ranging from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig>  <cit> , globins are so far known to be present only in dipterans, such as gasterophilus, drosophila and chironomus. it is evident that much work needs to be done before we have any clear idea of globin distribution in metazoans other than deuterostomes.

among the lower eukaryotes, our census suggests that globins could be ubiquitous in fungi , mycetozoa , diplomonads , ciliates , stramenopiles , rhodophytes , chlorophytes  and plants . in contrast, the genomes of pathogenic microsporidians, entamoebae, apicomplexans anad trypanosomes are devoid of globins. in view of a very large potential diversity of small, bacterial-sized eukaryotes revealed by recent, culture-independent surveys  <cit> , much remains to be done.

since our census indicates that gcss do not occur in eukaryotes, it is necessary to consider the heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase , which was found recently to have two heme-binding domains, of which the n-terminal domain was considered to be globin-like  <cit>  although it was demonstrated that his <dig> and his <dig> were the two residues involved in heme binding  <cit> , we find that the n-terminal 138aa of the rabbit protein  is not recognized as a globin in cd or fugue searches. a blastp search of the genbank database found at least  <dig> mammalian counterparts; clearly, a structure is required to determine whether these sequences are globins.

molecular evolution
the broad distribution of the three lineages of globins, the 3/ <dig> fhbs/sdgbs, the 3/ <dig> gcs/pgbs and the 2/ <dig> hbs, is illustrated in the bayesian phylogenetic tree shown in fig.  <dig>  based on a global manual alignment of  <dig> sequences representing all the major groups of globins . the 2/ <dig> hbs and the gcss/pgbs cluster separately , with the three classes of 2/ <dig> hbs clearly delineated. within the 2/2hb clusters, the archaeal , ciliate  and chlorophyte  globins occur with the class  <dig> and the diatom  and plant  hbs group with the class  <dig>  the remaining stem encompasses the bacterial and eukaryotic fhbs and related sdgbs , including the cyanidioschyzon and thalassiosira sdgbs, the separate clusters of plant nshbs and shbs  and all the known metazoan globins, including the vertebrate globins . noteworthy is the clustering of bacterial sdgbs with the globin domains of bacterial and eukaryote  fhbs, suggestive of past lateral gene transfer events  <cit> . likewise, the clustering of the archaeal 2/ <dig> hbs with the class  <dig> bacterial 2/ <dig> hbs, could be indicative of a past lateral gene transfer. very recently, a 2/2hb and an fhb were found in the multicellular red alga chondrus crispus : these two sequences cluster with the thalassiosira 2/2hb and aquifex sdgb, respectively. an interesting result is the close grouping of amphitrite ornata dehaloperoxidase  <cit>  with the intracellular hemoglobin of the hydrothermal vent annelid alvinella pompejana  <cit> , suggesting that the latter may be a dehaloperoxidase also. the gallus and xenopus hbx group with the vertebrate ngbs as found earlier  <cit> . of particular interest is the large c. elegans globin family: all except f21a <dig>  and zk <dig> , cluster together, and appear to be closest to the vertebrate ngbs. zk <dig>  groups with globins from other nematode species, f21a <dig>  clusters with crustacean  and platyhelminth  sequences. it should be noted that the locations of these three globins is dependent on the number of globin sequences used to construct the phylogenetic tree.

we have discussed elsewhere  <cit>  the possible evolutionary scenarios for the emergence of the proposed three lineages of globins in two structural classes:  the 3-over- <dig> sd globins and fhbs,  the 3-over- <dig> gcs/pgbs, and , the 2-over- <dig> sdgbs. here, we would like to reiterate our proposal that all metazoan and plant globins originated from a sdgb related to the present day bacterial and algal sdgbs and the n-terminal globin domains of fungal and bacterial fhbs. this proposal is based on two results, one of which, is the clustering of all metazoan and plant sequences with the bacterial and eukaryote fhbs and sdgbs and separate from the branches encompassing 2/ <dig> hbs and gcss/pgbs, in the bayesian phylogenetic tree obtained earlier  <cit>  and in the one shown in fig.  <dig>  another key result, is that bacterial sdgbs and eukaryote fhb globin domains used as queries in iterated psiblast searches, recognize  vertebrate globins, particularly ngbs, and other metazoan globin groups, ahead of the 2/ <dig> hbs and gcss/pgbs  <cit> . conversely, vertebrate ngbs as a group, recognize the bacterial sdgbs ahead of other vertebrate globins. furthermore, the tree shown in fig.  <dig> is in very good agreement with recent models of vertebrate globin evolution  <cit> , wherein duplication of the ancestral globin gene resulted in neuroglobin and cellular globin genes, with subsequent duplication of the latter into cellular and hb gene loci, followed by additional duplications of the cellular globin locus into mb and cygb and of the hb gene into the α- and β-globin genes.

the first attempt at defining the molecular phylogeny of globins  <cit>  was a tree based on  <dig> sequences, all from eukaryotes. a subsequent study by moens et al.  <cit>  based on  <dig> sequences, including bacterial ones, proposed that all globins «evolved from a family of ancestral, ca.  <dig> kda hemeproteins, which displayed the globin fold and functioned as redox proteins». the present survey of extant globins in the three kingdoms of life provides some interesting additional details: we now know that there are three lineages of globins, two with a 3/ <dig> α-helical fold and one with the 2/ <dig> fold, and that only the latter occurs at present in all three kingdoms of life. furthermore, it appears likely that formation of chimeric proteins containing globin domains occurred, as separate events, prior to the emergence of the three kingdoms of life. there are no obvious explanations for the absence of fhbs in archaea and of gcss in eukaryotes. although it is not possible at present to decide which of the two folds originated from the other, the occurrence of 2/ <dig> hbs in all three kingdoms of life would suggest that it is the ancestral fold. a recent computational study of plant hb folding showed that one of the folding modules of rice 3/ <dig> nshb overlaps the 2/ <dig> fold of mycobacterium tuberculosis hbo  suggesting that it is an ancient structural feature of globins  <cit> .

globin function
the pesence of multiple globins in all three kingdoms of life raises the question of their function, paticularly among the unicellular organisms. although a complete discussion is not possible here, some general observations can be made, limited to organisms other than animalia. the bacterial fhbs appear to have a role primarily in the detoxification of no, via two nadh dependent activities, an no dioxygenase activity under aerobic conditions, or an no reductase activity under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . furthermore, the recent demonstration that the e. coli fhb binds lipids and is an efficient alkylhydroperoxide reductase, suggests that it may be involved in the repair of lipid membranes damaged by oxidative/nitrosative stress  <cit> . the function of bacterial sdgbs appear to be somewhat similar to the fhbs. although the function of vitreoscilla hb is to increase the effective intracellular o2concentration under microaerobic conditions  <cit> , that of campylobacter sdgb was shown recently to function only in no scavenging and detoxification and not provide resistance against superoxide or peroxides  <cit> . in eukaryotes, such as yeasts and dictyostelium, fhbs also provide protection against no  <cit> , as well as enhancement of respiration, directly by functioning as an o <dig> buffer and indirectly, by reducing the no concentration in the mitochondria which otherwise inhibits respiration  <cit> . in pathogenic microorganisms, fhb provides protection from human macrophage no-mediated killing and promotes the virulence of bacteria, e.g. salmonella  <cit> , and of yeasts, candida  <cit>  and cryptococcus neoformans, a worldwide pathogen causing pulmonary infection in animals and humans  <cit> . it is interesting to note, as suggested by one of the reviewers, that since most of the archaea are not pathogenic, they may have dispensed with the fhbs and their protective role in bacteria.

in plants, the shbs have been shown to be required for establishing a low oxygen concentration for the effective functioning of the bacterial nitrogenase necessary for nitrogen fixation  <cit> . although the role of 2/ <dig> hbs in plants is completely unknown, the nshbs, induced in plant cells upon exposure to low oxygen concentrations, are thought to play a role in a metabolic pathway which also involves nitric oxide and which provides an alternative type of respiration to the mitochondrial electron transport under hypoxic conditions  <cit> .

the gcss represent one of the four known families of heme-based sensors  <cit> , and can be subdivided into two groups, the hemats and the gene regulators. the former are aerotactic heme sensors, with a c-terminal domain that is related to chemotaxis methyl-accepting proteins. although bacillus subtilis hemat elicits an aerophilic response, that from the archaean halobacterium salinarum provides an aerophobic response  <cit> . the gene regulators have c-terminal domains, some of which may regulate second messengers and others that have unknown functions . although little is known about the specific function of the pgbs, they have a cys at position e <dig>  similar to globins of the annelids living in sulfide-rich environments, including deep sea hydrothermal vents and marine sediments, where this residue has been implicated in sulfide binding  <cit> .

recent studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis 2/ <dig> hbs, hbn  and hbo , indicate that the former functions in no detoxification, while hbo, which differs substantially from hbn in structure  <cit> , is expressed in association with cell membranes and significantly enhances respiration, suggesting an interaction with the electron transport chain  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether these findings apply to other bacterial 2/ <dig> hbs. although nothing is known about the function of the 2/2hb3s, it is safe to assume that it must differ from the other two classes, since  <dig> bacteria have two and mycobacterium avium ssp. tuberculosis and methylococcus capsulatus have all three classes of 2/ <dig> hbs.

finally, it is appropriate to mention here the case of the extracellular hb from the nematode ascaris suum, an octamer of two-domain globin chains, long known for its high oxygen affinity  <cit> , whose function appears to be that of an no reductase  <cit> , similar to that of fungal and bacterial fhbs. interestingly fugue searches using fhb and sdgb sequences as queries, invariably include the ascaris hb domain  <dig> structure  among the highest scoring globin structures. this case provides an additional bit of evidence in support of our proposal that the fhbs and related sdgbs from bacteria, algae and unicellular eukaryotes, including fungi, are part of one of the three globin lineages, and the one from which originated all metazoan globins and all plant shbs and nshbs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenomic profile derived from our survey of genomes from the three kingdoms of life presented here, delineates the present day limits of the occurrence of the three lineages of globins, and provides a clear view of the work that remains to be done. it appears likely that in contrast to archaea, where ~20% of the known genomes have globins, the majority of bacteria will be shown to have globins. based on the prevailing opinion that all plants have globins, it is likely that this will also hold true for the unicellular, photosynthesizing eukaryotes. globin occurrence in other unicellular eukaryotes is likely to be episodic, just as in the case of nonvertebrate metazoans.

another obvious conclusion is that globins are mostly enzymes and less frequently sensors, and that transport of oxygen is a function that developed relatively recently, accompanying the emergence of multicellular organisms. there are at least two more known instances of evolution from enzyme to transporter. one, is the convergent evolution of indoleamine dioxygenase into a muscle heme protein with mb-like oxygen binding properties, in gastropod molluscs  <cit> . another are hemocyanins, the copper containing respiratory proteins in molluscs and arthropods, which have evolved from phenoloxidases, prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes  <cit> . the recent finding of hemerythrins, similar to the nonheme iron respiratory protein of sipunculids, brachiopods and priapulids, in the methanotrophic gammaproteobacterium methylococcus capsulatus, and in other prokaryotes  <cit> , and also in the hydrothermal vent annelid riftia pachyptila , where they may have an enzymatic function, suggests yet another possible instance.
