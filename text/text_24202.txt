BACKGROUND
the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  include diseases such as scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle, and creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in humans. prions are the causative agent of tses and consist predominantly of an abnormally folded, partially protease resistant isoform of the cellular prion protein   <cit> . prions are notoriously difficult to inactivate and, in the case of bse, pose a lethal zoonotic disease risk  <cit> . oral exposure is considered the natural route of infection for most tses affecting domestic species, and is considered the route by which humans acquired a new variant form of cjd  after exposure to bse-contaminated beef during the bse epidemic in the united kingdom  <cit> . effective prion decontamination methods in settings such as abattoirs, for example, are desirable to further minimize the risk of zoonotic tse transmission. efficacious decontamination procedures that can be applied to environmental settings also are desirable to aid in the control of tses such as scrapie and chronic wasting disease, which are horizontally transmitted  <cit> .

prions are unusually resistant to methods effective at inactivating conventional microorganisms, such as moderate heating, ultraviolet irradiation, and formalin exposure  <cit> . current decontamination recommendations by the world health organization, depending on material to be sterilized, include autoclaving at 134°c for up to  <dig> hour, or prolonged exposure to  <dig> n sodium hydroxide or ≥  <dig>  ppm sodium hypochlorite  <cit> . procedures such as treatment with sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite are especially detrimental to delicate surgical and diagnostic equipment, spurring research into less caustic alternatives. recent lines of investigation have included treatment of contaminated material with proteolytic enzymes  <cit> , sodium dodecyl sulfate  <cit> , and peroxygen compounds  <cit>  with variable success. a  <dig> - <dig>  log <dig> reduction in infectivity of scrapie strain  <dig> k bioassayed in syrian hamsters was demonstrated after treatment of contaminated stainless steel wires with vaporized hydrogen peroxide with or without an enzymatic cleaner  <cit> . in contrast, a ≤ <dig> log <dig> reduction in infectivity was demonstrated with liquid hydrogen peroxide  <cit> .

sodium percarbonate, an oxidizing agent comprising an adduct of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide , is the active ingredient in a number of commercially available cleaning products. a major advantage of sodium percarbonate is its high degree of environmental compatibility, with degradation products consisting of water, oxygen, and sodium carbonate. in aqueous solution, sodium percarbonate generates a ph of 10– <dig>  prompted by positive results using vaporized hydrogen peroxide to inactivate the scrapie agent, we investigated the prion-inactivating potential of a commercial product containing sodium percarbonate . sodium dodecyl sulfate alone has been shown to variably reduce prion infectivity  <cit> . we chose to incorporate it in this study due to its detergent and denaturant properties. brain homogenate from terminally ill c57bl/ <dig> mice positive for the mouse-adapted rml strain of scrapie was subjected to various spc-p-based treatment conditions. western blot  analysis was used to detect residual prpsc in treated samples, and residual infectivity was assayed by intracranial inoculation into prion protein overexpressing tga <dig> mice  <cit> .

RESULTS
immunoblotting
residual prpsc in brain homogenate treated with a low or high concentration of the spc-containing product  alone or in combination with  <dig> % sds was assayed via wb. immunoblots were performed in triplicate with representative blots presented in figure  <dig>  immunoreactivity for the di-, mono-, and unglycosylated forms of prpsc was present in spc-pl treated samples after proteinase k  digestion , but was undetectable in spc-ph treated samples . when pk digestion was omitted, prp immunoreactivity was similarly detectable in all spc-pl treated samples and faint banding was present in spc-ph treated samples . when samples treated with either spc-pl or spc-ph in combination with sds were subjected to limited proteolysis with pk prior to immunoblotting, prpsc immunoreactivity was undetectable for all treatment conditions . rml brain homogenate exposed to sds only retained detectable but decreased prpsc immunoreactivity after pk digestion . both concentrations of spc-p used in this study generated a ph of approximately  <dig> in solution. to evaluate the effect of ph, brain samples buffered with  <dig>  m sodium hydrogen phosphate  were incubated at room temperature for  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> minutes. prpsc immunoreactivity was undetectable after pk digestion at all time points .

mouse bioassay
residual infectivity in treated samples was assayed via intracranial inoculation of tga <dig> mice. the average number of days to terminal disease for the positive control group  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, which is typical of rml disease kinetics in tga <dig> mice inoculated intracranially  <cit> . ten-fold serial dilutions of this stock resulted in an increase in incubation and mean survival times. the survival curves generated from these data were used as the comparative standard when evaluating survival time in mice inoculated with treated samples and for approximating reductions in infectivity. all animals inoculated with a 10- <dig> or greater dilution survived until termination of the study at  <dig> months post-inoculation  , with the exception of  <dig> mice removed from the study and censored from survival statistics due to intercurrent disease. one mouse from the 10- <dig> group was also censored from survival data due to intercurrent disease. consistent clinical signs observed in scrapie-affected mice included ataxia that progressed to a listing or rolling gait in some cases, pelvic limb paresis, and lethargy. all but  <dig> animals in the negative control group  survived until study termination at  <dig> months pi. one mouse was euthanized due to severe hydrocephalus and the other death was undetermined.

treatment of brain homogenate with spc-pl or spc-ph alone had minimal effect on infectivity. the average time to disease in all animals inoculated with spc-pl or spc-ph was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, respectively. the limited increase in survival time of the spc-ph treated groups corresponded to an approximate  <dig> log <dig> reduction in infectivity . in contrast, exposure of the inoculum to a solution of spc-pl or spc-ph containing sds resulted in a 2– <dig> log <dig> reduction in infectivity . the average time to terminal disease for the spc-ph + sds groups at  <dig> min,  <dig> min, and  <dig> min was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, respectively. these values corresponded to an approximate  <dig> log <dig> reduction; however, the transmission rate was 100%. a 2– <dig> log <dig> reduction was achieved with spc-pl + sds. this effect was time-dependent with  <dig> min,  <dig> min, and  <dig> min treatment groups surviving on average  <dig> ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, respectively. additionally, 10% of mice in the  <dig> min treatment group and 20% in the  <dig> min group survived until study termination at  <dig> months pi. mice inoculated with samples exposed to sds alone for  <dig> min,  <dig> min, or  <dig> min developed disease in  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days, respectively, corresponding to an approximate  <dig> log <dig> reduction in infectivity for each group , but with a transmission rate of 100%. eight mice total were censored from survival statistics due to intercurrent disease including  <dig> mice in the spc-ph + sds group ,  <dig> mice in the  <dig> min spc-pl + sds group , and  <dig> mouse in the  <dig> min spc-pl + sds group .

neuropathology and prp immunohistochemistry
lesions of spongiform encephalopathy  in affected mice were predominantly present in thalamic and midbrain nuclei and consisted of  <dig> –  <dig> μm, clear, round vacuoles primarily within the neuropil, but also occasionally present within neurons. milder se lesions were present in the cerebral cortex, septal nuclei, cornus ammonis regions of the hippocampus, cerebellar nuclei, and brainstem nuclei. the cerebellar cortex lacked definitive se lesions as did cerebral and cerebellar white matter. mild to moderate gliosis and scattered degenerate neurons, characterized by hyperchromasia, a shrunken and angular profile, and loss of fine nuclear detail were associated with areas of se. approximately 8% of mice exposed to inocula from the spc-p + sds treated groups developed varying degrees of hydrocephalus that was most often noted incidentally at necropsy. immunoreactivity for prpsc in affected mice corresponded to areas of se and was most intense in midbrain and vestibular nuclei. immunoreactivity was predominantly present as fine punctate granules within the neuropil and less often as fine deposits around individual neuronal soma and dendrites .

discussion
in this report, we investigated the effectiveness of a product containing the oxidizing agent sodium percarbonate to inactivate the rml scrapie agent. sodium dodecyl sulfate at  <dig> % w/v also was added to certain treatment groups to evaluate the combinatorial effect of spc-p and sds. treated samples were evaluated for prpsc immunoreactivity by western blot and residual infectivity by mouse bioassay using tga <dig> mice. our choice for using the tga <dig> mouse for the bioassay was largely due to the well-characterized and relatively rapid disease kinetics of rml scrapie in this strain of mouse  <cit> . we were able to measure a reduction in infectivity over a range of 105-fold with this model, which was adequate for this particular study because of the poor efficacy of the product resulting in survival times well within the detection range. product choice and treatment conditions for this study were defined by the following considerations: 1) the product should be sufficiently non-hazardous to the environment and human health to be applied safely on a large-scale; and 2) treatment conditions  should be similar to those that could be realistically achieved in, for example, an abattoir.

a major finding of this study was the increased sensitivity of prpsc to pk by the spc-based product without  or with sds at room temperature, as judged by immunoblotting after exposure of the samples to limited proteolysis. based on the loss of detectable prpsc immunoreactivity after incubation at ph  <dig>  it appears this effect may be largely ph-dependent. it is well established that prion infectivity is reduced under extremely basic conditions, such as exposure to naoh   <cit> . while the ph generated by spc-p is lower at  <dig>  it appears to be a favorable characteristic of the compound with regard to prpsc protease sensitivity. however, a solely ph-dependent effect does not explain why spc-pl treatment alone  did not yield similar wb results. one possible explanation is that a lower concentration of the product may have contained diminished buffering capacity resulting in a drop in ph as treatment proceeded, but serial ph evaluation of treated brain homogenate at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> min revealed that the ph remained above  <dig> . although treatment with the spc product did render prpsc sensitive to digestion by proteinase k, it did not eliminate infectivity. recent studies examining prion infectivity in infected tissue and cell cultures have also demonstrated loss of detectable prpsc on western blot, but residual infectivity  <cit> . our results support the inference that biochemical analysis alone is insufficient for determination of prion infectivity. the observed prpsc/infectivity mismatch in this study and in others warrants a number of considerations including wb sensitivity, epitope disruption by inactivation treatments, and alternative infectious agents to prpsc, such as pk-sensitive forms of prp or viruses. it is possible the amount of residual prpsc in our treated samples was below the detection limit of our wb , or it may be that a true dissociation of prpsc and tse infectivity exists supporting the actuality of alternative infectious agents to prpsc <cit> . a recent study has demonstrated poor correlation between infectivity and wb results for sheep scrapie and sheep bse  <cit>  in line with observations that pk-sensitive prp particles are associated with disease  <cit> .

the bioassay results we present indicate that exposure to the selected spc-based product alone or in combination with  <dig> % sds is not a viable option for the inactivation of prions. no decrease in infectivity was observed using the spc-pl solution alone, and a modest  <dig> log <dig> reduction was achieved with the spc-ph solution. however, recent investigations have demonstrated differential susceptibility of distinct prion strains to the same inactivation procedure  <cit> ; therefore, we are currently investigating the efficacy of these treatment conditions in an ovine scrapie model. it should also be acknowledged that chemical treatment of the scrapie agent has been shown to delay the dose–response relationship  <cit>  resulting in prolonged incubation times without a change in calculable titer. it is possible our results could be reflecting this phenomenon, but without bioassay data from serial dilutions of treated brain homogenate this cannot be definitively determined. some caution may therefore be warranted when interpreting these results. the addition of  <dig> % sds to the spc-p solutions resulted in a 2– <dig> log <dig> reduction in infectivity, but exposure to sds alone resulted in an approximate  <dig> log <dig> reduction. this suggests much of the observed combinatorial effect was due to sds. prior studies using sds have demonstrated minimal effects on cjd infectivity  <cit> , but up to a  <dig> log <dig> reduction on scrapie infectivity  <cit> . exposure of hamster-adapted sc <dig> scrapie to room temperature sds at ph values of ≤ <dig>  or ≥ <dig> resulted in increased pk sensitivity of prpsc, and exposure to acidic sds resulted in decreased infectivity  <cit> . since sds at room temperature is an effective denaturant at a ph ≥ <dig>  this could have contributed to the loss of detectable prpsc-immunoreactivity we observed after proteolysis in samples treated with spc-p and sds. there was also enhanced reduction in infectivity with the combination of spc-pl and sds. this may be indicative of an enhanced effect of sds under basic conditions or a two-step mechanism whereby denaturation of prpsc by the relatively high ph of the solution and/or sds is followed by exposure of sites sensitive to oxidative damage. alternatively, the two treatment components could be acting on different prpsc fractions in the inoculum resulting in an additive effect since the combination of spc-pl and sds was roughly equivalent to slightly greater than the sum of the effects of each individual component. the combination of spc-ph and sds did not provide an equivalent or better increase in survival time than the combination of spc-pl and sds. while we are confident in this result, we cannot definitively explain this observation. perhaps disease in this group was exacerbated by oxidative damage induced by the introduction of treated brain samples containing a greater concentration of sodium percarbonate. oxidative stress, whether a cause or consequence of disease progression, is considered an important contributor to prion neuropathology  <cit> . it is also possible that the spc-p solution at higher concentration may somehow be interfering with the denaturing action of sds. sds action may be enhanced when combined with lower concentrations of spc-p for longer exposure times, but restricted by higher concentrations, perhaps via chemical modification of sds binding sites on the protein.

oxidizing agents have been used with variable success in prion inactivation studies. exposure of prions to halogens such as sodium hypochlorite at ≥  <dig>  ppm is an accepted means of decontamination  <cit> , but chlorine dioxide is much less effective at inactivating hamster-adapted  <dig> k scrapie  <cit> . peroxygens such as liquid hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  and peracetic acid  <cit>  also promote limited inactivation. however, recent studies using vaporized hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate stainless steel surfaces have demonstrated significant reductions in infectivity for hamster-adapted  <dig> k scrapie and mouse-adapted bse  <cit> . a protective effect from oxidation by peracetic acid has been demonstrated with the me <dig> scrapie agent and attributed to prion aggregation  <cit> . peracetic acid at 2% was effective at inactivating the me <dig> scrapie agent in intact brain tissue, but not homogenized tissue. samples in the current study were homogenized, which may have imparted a degree of protection from oxidation and contributed to the ineffectiveness of spc-p alone at decreasing infectivity. we propose that the addition of sds would have decreased aggregation of cell membranes to which infectivity is bound, thus enhancing the activity of spc-p and perhaps contributing to the increased survival observed with the combination.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that exposure of the rml scrapie agent to an spc-containing product alone or in combination with sds does not eliminate prion infectivity, but does render prpsc sensitive to proteinase k. because of this, it is interesting to consider the potential viability of a combination of spc and sds, even at relatively low concentrations and mild temperatures, concomitant with or followed by a protease for prion decontamination. also, because the spc product we used contains additional proprietary ingredients, we cannot rule-out contributions to increased pk-sensitivity or increased survival by other components of the product. studies in our laboratory are currently underway examining exposure of prions to chemical grade spc with or without sds followed by exposure to a protease.
