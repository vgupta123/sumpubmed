BACKGROUND
branching is a major determinant of shoot architecture in plants and highly influences the yield of agricultural crops. the formation of branches begins when small meristematic tissue develops in the axils of leaves to form axillary buds  <cit> . once formed these buds usually remain in a state of suspended growth  until they receive a growth-triggering signal. these signals may be environmental, such as light, nutrients, and decapitation of the shoot tip, or endogenous, such as hormones and sugars  <cit> . the ability of a plant to respond to each of these signals determines its final shoot architecture.

there is still much debate and poor clarity on exactly how axillary buds are maintained dormant or promoted to grow out  <cit> . multiple signaling pathways are known to regulate this process, but little is known about how these pathways are integrated and which signaling pathways predominate at which stages of development. for example, it has recently been shown that sugars are the likely initial trigger of bud outgrowth after decapitation of the shoot tip  <cit> , but whether sugars also interact with hormone or other environmental signaling pathways is yet to be determined. therefore, in order to better understand the genetic changes involved in bud outgrowth, we sequenced the first transcriptome of axillary buds from garden pea  plants. garden peas have large buds separated by long internodes, making it easier to harvest bud tissue specifically. in addition, branching has been well studied in garden pea with many resources available, including branching mutants and curated transcriptome libraries  <cit> .

this is the first of two gene expression studies of pea axillary buds using this new transcriptome resource. here we report and describe the pea axillary bud transcriptome and identify a significant time-of-day experimental variable influencing gene expression during the sample collection time frame in the rms5- <dig> genetic background. these mutants are near-isogenic with the wild type cv. torsdag widely used in developmental genetics and hormone studies, and produce very little endogenous strigolactone, a plant hormone which represses axillary bud outgrowth  <cit>  therefore enabling inclusion of transcripts involved in active bud outgrowth. in addition to establishing a quality pea bud transcriptome, we identified gene expression changes in the growing axillary buds samples at different time windows over a 170 min time frame that are contributed by diurnal and circadian effects. these results have implications for future design of gene expression studies as most gene expression studies that utilize multiple treatments and replicates require the samples to be harvested over a period of time.

assessment of the transcriptome assembly
a number of criteria were used to determine the redundancy and quality of our pea bud transcriptome assembly, including comparisons to published transcriptomes from pea and other plant species, and alignment to available pea gene sequences.

the pea axillary bud transcriptome redundancy and comparison to other pea gene sequences
firstly, we tested within-assembly redundancy by comparing the assembled isoforms to all other isoforms using blastn  and a minimum hit coverage of 80% . most of the matches were between isoforms from the same transcript, with only six matches between different transcripts. this suggests a very low redundancy of transcripts in our assembly.

as a number of pea transcriptomes have previously been published , we compared them with our pea bud transcriptome. over 90% of the pea transcripts generated using earlier  <dig> sequencing technology  are contained within our transcriptome assembly . in line with this, our transcriptome contained significantly more transcripts than the other transcriptomes . these results are likely due to the increased sequence read length and depth used in our transcriptome sequencing, resulting in a more comprehensive transcriptome assembly and discovery of novel pea genes. this is further corroborated by comparisons to the more recent pea transcriptomes of the kaspa and parafield genotypes  <cit>  that used similar illumina sequencing technology to ours. in these cases, we found that ~75% of our isoforms are present in the kaspa and parafield transcriptomes, while ~78% of the kaspa and parafield transcripts were present in our transcriptome . it is worth noting that all of the published pea transcriptomes comprise a number of different plant tissues while ours is restricted to the axillary bud. this may imply that many of the differences in overlap are the result of true biological differences between tissues, highlighting the complexity of the transcriptome of the developing axillary bud.table  <dig> blast comparisons  between the pea bud isoforms as the query and pisum sativum contigs  or medicago cds and proteins as the reference






we also found that approximately 80% of pea protein sequences available in the swiss-prot and uniprotkb databases had a matching transcript in the transcriptome, using blastx  with a minimum hit coverage of 80% . therefore, our comprehensive de novo transcripts assembly has allowed us to generate a representative catalog of genes expressed in a pea bud.table  <dig> blastx  comparisons between the pea bud isoforms as the query and ultra-conserved ortholog  protein sequences, swiss-prot pea or uniprotkb pea protein sequences as the reference




inter-specific sequence comparison
in the absence of garden pea reference genome sequences, we used the coding sequences  annotated in the whole genome assembly of the closest available relative, medicago truncatula , to annotate the axillary bud transcriptome isoforms using tblastx . over 60% of the pea isoforms matched to a medicago cds, while ~77% of the medicago cds matched a pea isoform . the discrepancy between the pairwise tblastx searches is likely explained by a combined effect of pea-specific and non-coding transcripts which is especially likely given the almost 9-fold increase in the garden pea genome size relative to medicago  <cit> , as well as alternatively spliced isoforms or potential mis-assemblies.

furthermore, we compared our transcriptome to a list of  <dig> ultra conserved orthologs . these are single copy genes conserved across eukaryotes, specifically arabidopsis thaliana, humans, mice, yeast, fruit flies and caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . using blastx  and a minimum 75% sequence coverage, we found 81% of the uco sequences in our pea bud transcriptome .

comparison to single copy gene sequences from pea
we used an arbitrarily selected set of ten previously sequenced single copy pea genes  to determine how well each transcript has been assembled. blastx  was used to compare these ten reference sequences against the pea bud transcriptome to determine how many copies of each gene was present in the transcriptome, and how well each transcript was assembled. only two of the ten reference sequences, psfed- <dig> and psrms <dig>  had more than one copy in the transcriptome . both of these transcripts had low read coverage over the reference transcript which could have impacted on the ability to properly assemble full-length transcripts . importantly, six of the reference sequences are matched by a single isoform covering the majority of the reference sequence , reflecting the high level of completeness of our assemblies. in support of this, eight of the assembled transcripts match at their 5′ end with the 5′ end of the reference sequences . as expected, transcript abundance affects this analysis, such that the transcripts of three pea genes with low abundance, psrms <dig>  psfed- <dig>  and pspete, are found only partially assembled in the pea axillary bud transcriptome.

annotation
in order to predict the putative function of the pea bud transcripts and their isoforms, blastx was used to align the isoforms, firstly with arabidopsis thaliana proteins , and secondly with all proteins from the ncbi non-redundant  sequence database . this led to  <dig> and 61% of the isoforms, and  <dig> and 34% of the transcripts being annotated by protein sequence similarity, respectively .

when we compared the length of the isoforms annotated with the nr protein sequence database with the unannotated isoforms, we found that the average unannotated isoform was 472 bp in length while the average annotated isoform was ~ <dig> times longer, with an average length of 1805 bp . to account for the fact that some of the isoforms may contain untranslated regions, we also determined the open-reading frame  sizes of the isoforms. the average orf size was 65 bp for the unannotated isoforms and 320 bp for the annotated isoforms, a similar fold-change to the difference in overall length between the two types of isoforms. the unannotated isoforms are mostly quite short in length, which suggests either that they are incomplete assemblies and so cannot be matched adequately to their homologues in other species, or that they may be non-coding rnas.fig.  <dig> 
a comparison of the sequence length  of unannotated and annotated isoforms from the de novo pea axillary bud assembly, and b the overlap between the number of unannotated isoforms and the number of lncrna in the pea bud transcriptome




to identify putative long non-coding rnas  in the pea bud transcriptome, we used a custom lncrna prediction computational pipeline which took into account four core filtering criteria: 1) similarities to known protein sequences and protein domains, 2) the presence of signal peptides, 3) isoform length , and 4) open reading frame size . using this approach, we found  <dig>  putative lncrnas , with a median length of 293 nt and a range from  <dig> to 2781 nt . two-thirds of the unannotated isoforms were identified as putative lncrnas ; conversely, none of the annotated isoforms were putative lncrnas.

the large number of putative lncrnas in pea is at the higher end of the range of the number of lncrnas predicted in other plants species with a genome sequence reference . this could be the result of a much larger non-coding portion of the pea genome  <cit> , and it would imply that some of the non-coding portion of the pea genome is transcribed. indeed, sequence comparison between the predicted lncrna and available pea repetitive dna sequences  <cit>  revealed that  <dig>   of the predicted lncrna represent various types of repetitive portions of the pea genome, with transcripts of the ltr retrotransposons ogre and maximus, as well as unclassified repeats, representing 68% of all repetitive dna transcripts . furthermore, in the absence of a reference pea genome sequence, isoforms of lncrna are not easily identifiable, potentially leading to inflated lncrna counts. in addition, our rna purification did not include a polya+ selection step; therefore it is likely that some of the lncrna may represent non-polyadenylated transcripts. recently, novel non-polyadenylated transcripts have been detected in the model plants arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . these non-polyadenylated transcripts, known as intermediate sized ncrnas , are 50–300 nt in length, have low protein-coding potential, and do not show sequence similarity to any known ncrna  <cit> .

sequence comparisons to lncrnas from medicago  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  were also made, identifying  <dig>  and  <dig>  lncrnas, respectively, conserved in pea . as lncrna are thought to be fast evolving and constrained by their secondary and tertiary structures  <cit>  and sometimes synteny  <cit> , rather than just their sequence, detecting hundreds of sequence-conserved lncrna provides a new resource for comparative analysis of lncrna sequence and structure conservation in flowering plants.

the pea bud transcriptome was also annotated with the rfam database of rna families  <cit> . a total of  <dig> isoforms and  <dig> transcripts were annotated in this way , of which small nucleolar rnas  and microrna  precursors  were the most highly represented rna families. interestingly, we identified  <dig> likely mirna precursor transcripts representing  <dig> mirna gene families expressed in the pea axillary bud .fig.  <dig> rfam non-coding rna families represented in the pea bud transcriptome




functional annotation of the pea axillary bud transcriptome
we functionally annotated the pea axillary bud transcriptome using both gene ontology  terms  <cit>  and kegg metabolic pathways  <cit> . we identified  <dig> kegg pathways with at least one member of the pathway annotated in the pea bud transcriptome, and at least  <dig> kegg pathways with more than 50% represented in the pea bud transcriptome . the kegg pathways with the highest percentage of enzymes annotated in the transcriptome were carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms with 21/ <dig>  enzymes annotated in the transcriptome, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis with 25/ <dig>  of the enzymes annotated in the transcriptome . this, along with the most highly represented go categories which included numerous metabolic processes , supports the fact that active and diverse metabolic processes are occurring in the photosynthetically active buds as they are growing.fig.  <dig> enzyme representation of the top five kegg pathways ranked by the percentage of enzymes annotated in the pea axillary bud transcriptome




diurnally regulated transcripts in pea axillary buds
to determine whether time of day had an effect on gene expression in axillary buds over the 170 min time frame of the collection of the samples, we used the rna-seq data from our mock treated samples for differential gene expression analysis contrasting gene expression between the three collection time windows. in addition to identifying diurnally regulated genes in pea buds , this analysis will inform future experimental design on axillary bud growth dynamics and gene expression studies. as the samples were collected in three groups between  <dig>  and  <dig>  pm , we designated samples harvested between  <dig>  and  <dig>  pm as time window  <dig>  samples harvested between  <dig>  and  <dig>  pm as time window  <dig>  and samples harvested between  <dig>  and  <dig>  pm as time window  <dig> as described in the methods section.

pairwise comparisons of gene expression differences were made between each of the time windows , which identified a total of  <dig> unique differentially expressed  transcripts. the time windows harvested closer together showed fewer de transcripts between them, with no de transcripts between time windows  <dig> and  <dig>  and only  <dig> de transcripts between time windows  <dig> and  <dig>  the time windows that were the furthest apart, time windows  <dig> and  <dig>  showed  <dig> de transcripts. there was an overlap of  <dig> de transcripts between the two analyses. we tested  <dig> randomly chosen de transcripts by qrt-pcr; all  <dig> were identified as de in our differential gene expression analysis between time windows  <dig> and  <dig>  while six were identified as de in the analysis between time windows  <dig> and  <dig>  the qrt-pcr results showed ten out of the  <dig>  transcripts were validated between time windows  <dig> and  <dig>  while only two out of six  were validated between time windows  <dig> and  <dig> . for the genes that were validated by qrt-pcr, very similar fold changes were identified by both the edger analysis and qrt-pcr . notably, due to the short time differences, these fold-changes were generally less than 3-fold.table  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts  between pairwise comparisons of each time window collected over a time frame of 170 min in pisum sativum buds

only half of the total unique de transcripts were annotated , which suggested an involvement of pea-specific genes, including non-coding rna. this was confirmed as 44% of the unannotated de transcripts were classified as putative lncrna using our criteria ; however, none of the de transcripts showed sequence homology to rfam and repetitive dna databases. this suggests that as well as affecting expression of protein-coding genes, the time of sample collection also affects expression of putative lncrnas. as not all of the unannotated transcripts were classified as putative lncrna, the remaining unannotated transcripts could have other functions such as encoding as yet unknown or pea-specific proteins or small rna precursors.table  <dig> list of annotated differentially expressed transcripts identified in pairwise comparisons  between the three time windows in pisum sativum buds collected over a 170 min time frame




lncrnas have previously been associated with diurnal changes and light responses  <cit> . hazen et al.  <cit>  looked for non-coding sequences that exhibited rhythmic expression and identified  <dig> intergenic regions of the arabidopsis genome that had rhythmic expression. in addition, 7% of protein-coding genes exhibited rhythmic expression of lncrna on the antisense strand, otherwise known as natural antisense transcripts . interestingly, they also found that a number of circadian clock genes had nats that exhibited diurnal fluctuations. this included pseudoresponse regulator , a transcriptional repressor that regulates key clock genes  <cit> , which was also identified as de in our study; the transcript comp90486_c <dig> assembly contained six isoforms, five of which were annotated as prr <dig> and one of which was annotated as a putative lncrna. unfortunately, as our libraries are not stranded, we were unable to confirm the putative lncrna isoform as a bona fide nat. we also found that ten of the de transcripts identified in our analysis were identified by nakamichi et al.  <cit>  as being bound and/or upregulated by prr <dig> .

enrichment analysis
to examine the function of the de transcripts, we performed a fisher’s exact test  to identify go terms that were enriched in the annotated de transcript data set compared to the reference transcriptome.

there was a significant, 9-fold enrichment in the number of de transcripts that were annotated with the go terms rhythmic process and circadian rhythm , which reflects the diurnal changes occurring in the buds. we have identified  <dig> genes in this set that have been characterized in the literature as being light-regulated or circadian clock-associated . in addition,  <dig>  de genes identified in this study were previously identified as diurnally regulated by blasing et al.  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> go terms enriched in the differential expression analysis according to fisher’s exact test , and ordered according to % of sequences annotated in the de gene set  and the reference gene set . the longest isoform for each transcript in the transcriptome was used in the analysis




importantly, we also identified six  go terms related to post-transcriptional modifications including rna methylation, ribonucleoprotein complex and nuclear speck . this finding is consistent with previous studies showing a role of post-transcriptional regulation in diurnal gene expression changes  <cit> .

we also examined the kegg pathways that were represented by the de genes by comparing the percentage of annotated de genes annotated in the each kegg pathway with the percentage of annotated reference genes present in each kegg pathway. we found that genes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway had the largest increase in the de gene set, with a 9-fold change . other large increases occurred in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway .fig.  <dig> kegg pathways represented in the differential expression analysis, ordered according to fold change difference between the percentage of genes annotated in the de gene set  and the reference gene set . the longest isoform for each transcript in the transcriptome was used in the analysis




3-ketoacyl synthase  <dig> , which is involved in the first steps of very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> , and long-chain acyl-coa synthetase  <dig> , which preferentially modifies very long chain fatty acids  for wax synthesis and long-chain fatty acids for cutin synthesis  <cit> , were both identified as de in this study. fatty acid synthesis occurs in the plastid to provide the components of cell membranes for all plant cells  <cit> , and has previously been linked to diurnal changes  <cit>  and is also required for growth.

increased requirements for energy needed for bud growth are met by increases in atp levels. oxidative phosphorylation is a key stage of respiration that occurs in the mitochondria to synthesize atp  <cit> . in agreement with this, enzymes from the mitochondria respiration complex i, nadh hydrogenase, , and complex iii, ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase subunit  <dig> , were identified as de in this study, and could potentially be regulated in a circadian fashion, likely to regulate the balance between glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation, as suggested by wagner et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a comprehensive pea bud transcriptome for which coding genes, putative lncrnas, and mirna precursors were identified. the assembly was validated by comparisons to other transcriptomes, which identified transcripts specific to pea axillary buds. further analysis of this transcriptome found that growing pea buds contain many transcripts related to metabolic pathways, suggesting that the growing buds are highly active.

gene expression was characterized in these growing axillary buds sampled in three time windows over a 170 min time frame. this analysis identified a number of transcripts changing over the short period of time and many of these could be annotated as genes with known or predicted diurnal regulation. it implies that changes in expression of genes known to be diurnally regulated are occurring quite rapidly in growing pea buds. the fact that we were able to discover a suite of differentially expressed genes over 170 min, and that some of them were annotated as diurnally related, indicates that our pea bud system should be sensitive enough to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to experimental treatments. it also implies the need for consideration of fast diurnal changes in gene expression when designing gene expression studies in pea axillary buds. further analysis discovered that a large proportion of the de transcripts were putative lncrnas and coding transcripts associated with post-transcriptional modifications.
