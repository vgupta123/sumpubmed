BACKGROUND
peach  is an important deciduous fruit, and its total production is ranked as 4th after grape, apple, and pear worldwide. china is the world’s leading producer of peach fruit, accounting for about 57 % of the total production. in japan, peach is ranked 6th in production, after mandarin, apple, pear, persimmon, and grape in  <dig>  fruit skin color is one of the most important traits for the commercial value of peach fruit, and it is mainly determined by the content and composition of anthocyanins for red color or carotenoids for yellow color  <cit> . with respect to carotenoid accumulation, yellow- and white-skinned types have been found, and the trait is controlled by a single y/y locus in linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . recently, characterization of the y/y locus has been reported by several research groups; carotenoid cleavage deoxygenase  <dig>  has been identified as a regulator of yellow pigmentation, and loss of function of ccd <dig> results in the yellow-skinned type . in contrast, red coloration of red-skinned peach depends on the accumulation of anthocyanins, which are water-soluble pigments of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. the intensity of red coloration is known to show variations depending on cultivars and strains, which suggests that red coloration is genetically controlled. moreover, anthocyanin accumulation in the skin largely depends on environmental factors such as light and temperature conditions . most japanese cultivars, including ‘akatsuki’, show red skin color when environmental conditions are appropriate, while some japanese cultivars, such as ‘mochizuki’, seldom accumulate anthocyanin; therefore, this type of cultivar is suitable for canned processing. in japan, red-skinned peach has a generally high market value, so farmers sometimes use the paper-bagging treatment for enhancing skin color, although production of white-skinned peach by using red-skinned cultivars  has been established in okayama prefecture in japan .

the molecular mechanism underlying anthocyanin accumulation has been well-characterized in fruit trees . recently, many structural genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and various transcription factors have been identified and characterized . of these, myb transcription factor genes were often found to be the major determinant of anthocyanin accumulation by acting together with basic helix-loop-helix  and wd <dig> proteins  to activate key anthocyanin biosynthetic genes . in grape, myb genes contribute to anthocyanin biosynthesis via expression of ufgt  <cit> . in apple, mybs are involved in the activation of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, and they regulate the accumulation of anthocyanin in fruit  <cit> . in pear, the transcription level of myb <dig> in the skin was positively correlated with anthocyanin biosynthetic gene pathway and anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . in peach, three myb <dig> genes, ppmyb <dig>  , ppmyb <dig>  , and ppmyb <dig>  , localized in a genomic region of linkage group  <dig> where the anther color  trait is located, have been reported as important regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis in peach fruit  <cit> . ppmyb <dig>  positively regulates the promoter of ppufgt, which is the only gene that shows a similar expression pattern to that of anthocyanin accumulation in peach skin during fruit development  <cit> . rahim et al.  <cit>  showed that the expression levels of ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  correlate with anthocyanin content as well as expression levels of key structural genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. our preliminary study on anthocyanin accumulation using red-skinned cultivars showed high expression levels of ppmyb <dig>  but quite low levels of ppmyb <dig> , which may indicate that anthocyanin accumulation in peach skin is dominantly regulated by only ppmyb <dig> .fig.  <dig> flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in plants. chs, chalcone synthase; chi, chalcone isomerase; f3h, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; dfr, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; ans, anthocyanidin synthase; ufgt, udp-glucose:flavonoid-3-o-glucosyltransferase



the aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular characterization of the three ppmyb <dig> genes by using japanese peach cultivars. we first used two japanese peach cultivars, white-skinned ‘mochizuki’ and red-skinned ‘akatsuki’, to study the relationship between the transcription levels of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig>  anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, and anthocyanin accumulation in fruit skin during fruit development. next, we analyzed overexpression of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> in tobacco and regulation of ppufgt promoter activity by ppmyb <dig> . finally, we investigated the intensity of red coloration in the peach skin based on the allelic type of ppmyb <dig> .

RESULTS
total anthocyanin content and expression analysis of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in fruit skin of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’
the fruit skin of ‘mochizuki’ is green in the first four stages and pale-yellow in the ripening stage, stage  <dig> . ‘akatsuki’ fruit skin is also green in the early stages and partially or nearly red in stages  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . total anthocyanin content in fruit skin was measured . as expected, white-skinned ‘mochizuki’ did not show anthocyanin in the skin throughout fruit development. anthocyanin was also not found at the beginning of ‘akatsuki’ fruit development, and it only appeared in stage  <dig> and increased to a great extent in stage  <dig>  this is in accordance with the red coloration observed in stages  <dig> and  <dig> of ‘akatsuki’ skin.fig.  <dig>

expression profiles of structural genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were examined using quantitative real-time pcr  . in general, genes involved in the upstream pathway, including ppchs, ppchi, ppf3h, and ppdfr, showed similar expression patterns in the skin of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ during fruit development; the expression levels increased from stage  <dig>  peaked at stage  <dig>  and then decreased in the last three stages. this is also the expression pattern of ppans in the skin of ‘mochizuki’, while ppans revealed the highest expression level in stage  <dig> for ‘akatsuki’. the mrna level of ppufgt was low in ‘mochizuki’ skin in all stages, and it was also low in ‘akatsuki’ skin in the three early stages and increased in stages  <dig> and  <dig>  although the expression levels of ppchs, ppdfr, and ppans were higher in the skin in stages  <dig> and  <dig> of ‘akatsuki’ fruit, only the last step gene that directly leads to anthocyanin accumulation, ppufgt showed an expression pattern tightly correlated with anthocyanin accumulation in the skin throughout fruit development in ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. these results suggest that ppufgt is the key gene for anthocyanin accumulation in the skin of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ fruit. therefore, we characterized myb genes that could act as a trans-factor of ppufgt.

expression analysis of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> in the skin of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ fruit
ppmyb <dig> , ppmyb <dig> , and ppmyb <dig>  are localized near each other in linkage group  <dig>  due to high similarity of the nucleotide sequences among these ppmyb10s , qrt-pcr primers for ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> were manually designed on the basis of divergent nucleotide sequences between them. real-time pcr products were then carefully tested for specificity by cloning into a pcr <dig> -topo vector, and seven individual plasmid clones were sequenced to ensure product specificity for each primer set. expression levels of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> were low in the skin during the five developmental stages of ‘mochizuki’ fruit . in ‘akatsuki’ skin, expression levels of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> were also low at the beginning of fruit development; then, transcription levels of ppmyb <dig>  dramatically increased in stages  <dig> and  <dig>  while expression levels of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> remained low throughout fruit maturation. high mrna levels of ppmyb <dig>  found in stages  <dig> and  <dig> were correlated with anthocyanin content and red pigmentation, which were observed only in these two ripening stages of ‘akatsuki’ fruit. these results demonstrated that ppmyb <dig>  alone is responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in the skin of ‘akatsuki’. to confirm this assumption, we then created transgenic tobacco plants that overexpressed the three ppmyb <dig> genes.fig.  <dig>

characterization of transgenic tobacco plants that overexpressed ppmyb <dig> /2/3
orfs of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> driven by the camv 35s promoter were introduced into nicotiana tabacum sr <dig> by using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain lba <dig>  regenerated plants on plates containing 50 mg/l of kanamycin were examined for the presence of transgenes by using pcr with extracted genomic dna . for each overexpression construct, six independent lines of transgenic plants showing the presence of the corresponding transgene were selected to transfer to the soil and grown under greenhouse conditions. as observed in fig. 4a, introduction of ppmyb <dig>  resulted in a deeper red color in transgenic tobacco flowers when compared with the wild-type tobacco flowers. the capsule skin of transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing ppmyb <dig>  also displayed a pale red color, while the capsule skin of wild-type tobacco was green . transgenic tobacco plants transformed with ppmyb <dig> / <dig> showed no coloration differences with respect to flowers when compared with wild-type flowers . this color observation reflected that obviously higher anthocyanin accumulation was only found in the flowers of six ppmyb <dig>  transgenic tobacco lines . to investigate the regulation of branching genes for specific flavonoid groups, such as flavonols and tannins, by transgenes, expression levels of transgenes ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> and n. tabacum fls, lar, anr, and ufgt were analyzed in transgenic tobacco flowers . the results showed that all ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> mrnas were transcribed . moreover, overexpression of ppmyb <dig>  substantially upregulated only ntufgt expression, and overexpression of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> did not markedly alter the transcription of all four examined genes in transgenic tobacco flowers . in addition, expression level of ntufgt was consistent with the expression level of ppmyb <dig>  transgene in six independent transgenic lines . taken together, only ppmyb <dig>  can activate tobacco ntufgt, resulting in higher anthocyanin accumulation and deeper red color in transgenic tobacco flowers. then, what are the functions of ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig> ? to confirm this, we analyzed expressions in leaves and flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’.fig.  <dig> photographs  and total anthocyanin content  of transgenic tobacco flowers overexpressing ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig>  height of the bars and error bars shows the mean and standard error, respectively, from three independent measurements

total anthocyanin content and expression analysis of ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> in leaves and flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’
leaves of both ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ are green and showed no anthocyanin accumulation and very low ppufgt transcription . ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  were also poorly transcribed, but a high expression level of ppmyb <dig>  was found in the leaves of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ . ‘akatsuki’ flowers showed higher ppufgt expression levels than ‘mochizuki’ flowers, leading to higher total anthocyanin content in ‘akatsuki’ flowers . it was correlated with the expression of ppmyb <dig>  in flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. ppmyb <dig>  transcription was high but not associated with anthocyanin content, and only trace ppmyb <dig>  expression was detected in flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. these results indicate that ppmyb <dig>  is responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  have functions other than anthocyanin accumulation in leaves and flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’.fig.  <dig>

functional analysis of ppmyb <dig>  by transient promoter assay in a heterologous system
to evaluate the regulatory capacity of ppmyb <dig>  on the expression of ppufgt, transient expression of a fluc reporter gene under the control of the putative ppufgt promoter regulated by ppmyb <dig>  alone or a combination of ppmyb <dig>  and ppbhlh <dig> was evaluated in nicotiana benthamiana leaves. as shown in fig.  <dig>  activity of the ppufgt promoter was significantly induced by ppmyb <dig>  in the presence of ppbhlh <dig>  ppmyb <dig>  and ppbhlh <dig> alone could not significantly increase the promoter activity of ppufgt.fig.  <dig> transient activation of the 2000-bp upstream regions of ppufgt by ppmyb <dig>  alone or in combination with ppbhlh <dig>  height of the bars and error bars shows the mean and standard error, respectively, from six independent measurements. the asterisk indicates a significant difference  from leaves infiltrated with the only promoter of ppufgt, by using the two-tailed student’s t-test



investigation of the differences in ppmyb <dig>  expression in ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’
since ppmyb <dig>  was differentially expressed in red-skinned ‘akatsuki’ and white-skinned ‘mochizuki’, we then intended to investigate the expression of nac including blood  and squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor  genes that have been reported as upstream transcription factors for myb regulation in red-fleshed peach  <cit> . the expression level of ppbl in ‘akatsuki’ was higher than in ‘mochizuki’, but apparent expression of ppbl was also recorded even in white-skinned ‘mochizuki’ albeit less much . expression of ppspl <dig>  which was believed as a transcriptional repressor of the promoter of ppmyb <dig>   <cit> , was inversely correlated with the transcription of ppmyb <dig>  in fruit skin during fruit development of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. these results indicated that ppmyb <dig>  expression and red skin color was regulated by ppbl and ppspl <dig> as in the case of blood flesh  <cit> . however, it was noticed that ppbl expression was increased in skin of stage  <dig> of ‘mochizuki’ fruits where ppmyb <dig>  expression level remained low, indicating other factors such as genomic structure may be also involved in the regulation of ppmyb <dig>  activity. therefore, we further investigated the genomic sequences of ppmyb <dig>  in red-skinned cultivar and white-skinned cultivar. there were many insertion/deletion  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the sequences of up- and down-streams as well as introns in mochizuki-type ppmyb <dig>  compared to akatsuki-type ppmyb <dig>   . especially, the coding regions of myb <dig> - <dig> type showed one deletion at 8–13 nt of exon i and three snps at  <dig>   <dig> and 617 nt of exon iii, causing two amino acid deletion and four amino acid substitution in coding regions of myb <dig> - <dig> compared to that of myb <dig> - <dig> type . based on these three snps of exon iii, we investigated the mrna sequences of ppmyb <dig>  in ‘shimizu-hakuto’, which was preliminary found to be heterozygous for ppmyb <dig>  locus . the results showed that all the transcripts of ppmyb <dig>  from  <dig> independent clones were derived from myb <dig> - <dig> only , indicating that the reason for induction of ppmyb <dig>  expression is ascribed to ppmyb <dig>  genomic structure. based on the differences in two ppmyb <dig>  types, we tried to classify  <dig> japanese peach cultivars. thirteen cultivars showing red skin color  including ‘akatsuki’ possess two myb <dig> - <dig> type, while those with white skin color  including ‘mochizuki’ had two myb <dig> - <dig> type . among seven analyzed cultivars with pale red skin color , three cultivars had two myb <dig> - <dig> type, while other four cultivars were consisted of one myb <dig> - <dig> type and one myb <dig>  type . although we cannot exclude other possibilities such as epigenetic regulation for the differences in ppmyb <dig>  expression in ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’, these results demonstrated that the skin color phenotypes can be partially explained by the differences in ppmyb <dig>  allelic types.fig.  <dig> genomic structure of ppmyb <dig>  allele. “∣”, “+n”, and “-n” indicate the single nucleotide polymorphism, number of nucleotide insertion, and number of nucleotide deletion, respectively, of myb <dig> - <dig> type compared to myb <dig> - <dig> type.  indicate the nucleotide position relative to start codon atg. p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> are three primers used to discriminate myb <dig>  allelic types



discussion
ppmyb <dig>  contributes to anthocyanin accumulation in peach fruit skin and flowers
the transcription factor myb <dig> group has been reported to be responsible for the red coloration in the skin of several rosaceae fruit trees such as apple, pear, and strawberry  <cit> . for peach, ravaglia et al.  <cit>  first demonstrated the importance of ppmyb <dig>  in anthocyanin accumulation in nectarine, while rahim et al.  <cit>  reported that expression levels of ppmyb <dig>  and ppmyb <dig>  correlated with the anthocyanin content of the peel, mesocarp, and mesocarp around the stone. these results were not consistent with our expression analysis results that ppmyb <dig> / <dig> transcript was very low in the red-skinned samples and only expression of ppmyb <dig>  was highly consistent with anthocyanin accumulation throughout fruit development . recently, zhou et al.  <cit>  also showed that only ppmyb <dig>  expression is correlated with anthocyanin level in blood-flesh peach. we assumed that the anthocyanin biosynthetic mechanism may depend on the analyzed peach cultivars and fruit tissues. in this study, the direct contribution of ppmyb <dig>  to anthocyanin accumulation and red coloration of fruit skin and flowers of ‘akatsuki’ was found . during fruit development in ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’, ppmyb <dig>  expression was highly correlated with ppufgt . transient expression analysis of tobacco leaves indicated that ppmyb <dig> /ppbhlh <dig> significantly increased the activities of the ppufgt promoter . furthermore, overexpression of ppmyb <dig>  resulted in higher anthocyanin content and deeper red color in transgenic tobacco and increased only ntufgt expression but no other branching genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway . in addition, ppmyb <dig>  alone contributes to anthocyanin accumulation and red coloration in the flesh, like in the skin of ‘akatsuki’ fruit . these results confirm that ppmyb <dig>  is the key regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and that it successfully activates the promoter of ppufgt at least in japanese peach cultivars, including ‘akatsuki’.

ppmyb <dig> / <dig> contributes to processes other than anthocyanin accumulation
expression levels of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> were low throughout the fruit development of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ and were not associated with anthocyanin accumulation and red coloration . a considerable level of ppmyb <dig>  expression was detected in peach leaves that do not contain anthocyanin, and high expression of ppmyb <dig>  was not also consistent with the anthocyanin content of flowers of ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’ . rahim et al.  <cit>  showed that ppmyb <dig>  contributes to anthocyanin accumulation during leaf senescence and flower development. however, a recent study indicated that ppmyb <dig>  on linkage group  <dig> regulates anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaf, while ppmyb <dig>  do not contribute to the leaf red coloration  <cit> . in this study, our results also proposed that ppmyb <dig> / <dig> do not play roles in the accumulation of anthocyanin in peach leaves and flowers . moreover, introduction of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> did not alter the flavonoid biosynthetic genes in tobacco as well anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic tobacco flowers . in arabidopsis, atmyb <dig>  and atmyb <dig> , named production of anthocyanin pigment  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were identified as regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis. atpap <dig> and atpap <dig> share high sequence identity and were clustered together in the myb phylogeny tree constructed by ravaglia et al.  <cit> . however, overexpression of not atpap <dig> but atpap <dig> stimulates expression level of the anthocyanin structural gene and anthocyanin accumulation in seedlings of transgenic arabidopsis plant  <cit> . similarly, ppmyb <dig> /2/ <dig> share high sequence identity at amino acid level. we hypothesized that the r/b-like bhlh binding motifs  of ppmyb <dig> / <dig> showed an amino acid different with those of ppmyb <dig>    <cit> , by which ppmyb <dig> / <dig> proteins probably act with different bhlhs with ppmyb <dig>  to play roles in processes other than anthocyanin biosynthesis.

preliminary comparisons of myb <dig>  alleles of white-skinned and red-skinned peach cultivars
since ppmyb <dig>  is a key regulatory gene for anthocyanin accumulation in skin, flower, and flesh, we tried to obtain a preliminary insight into the differences of ppmyb <dig>  activation observed in ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatsuki’. we first tried to find the cause in the upstream transcription factors of ppmyb <dig> . expression analysis of ppspl <dig> and ppnac indicated that these genes could be one of the factors for regulating ppmyb <dig>  expression levels in ‘mochizuki’ and ‘akatuski’, but other factors would be also involved in the cause for differential expressions observed . to confirm this, we identified the transcribed ppmyb <dig>  types using ‘shimizu-hakuto’. the results clearly showed that all the transcribed ppmyb <dig>  types were derived from not myb <dig> - <dig> but myb <dig> - <dig> , indicating that the activation of ppmyb <dig>  expression depends on ppmyb <dig>  allelic types. we then compared the differences in nucleotide sequences of ppmyb <dig>  orfs between white-skinned ‘mochizuki’ and red-skinned ‘akatsuki’ peach, causing different ppmyb <dig>  proteins were translated from myb <dig> - <dig> and myb <dig> - <dig> types . moreover, several sequence differences in myb <dig> - <dig> and myb <dig> - <dig> including indels and snps were recorded in the 5′-upstream, 3′-downstream, and intron . thus, genomic sequences of ppmyb <dig>  using  <dig> japanese peach cultivars with being different skin color enabled to classify into two types of ppmyb <dig> , myb <dig> - <dig> and myb <dig> - <dig> type, where two myb <dig> - <dig> types resulted in the white skin color, while two myb <dig> - <dig> or myb <dig> -1/myb <dig> - <dig> types showed red or pale red skin color . the question that which sequence differences among myb <dig> - <dig> and myb <dig> - <dig> types are the cause for activation and inactivation of ppmyb <dig>  was raised. zhou et al.  <cit>  who surveyed the differences in dna sequences of ppmyb <dig>  between chinese white-fleshed and red-fleshed peach cultivars, reported a 483-bp insertion and a snp in the promoter region and the second intron of ‘dahongpao’ blood-fleshed cultivar, respectively. this 483-bp insertion seems to be comparable to the 494-bp indel found in our study . however, this 483-bp insertion was not proved to link to the red flesh color in other chinese peach cultivars  <cit> ; in other word, this insertion was not a cause for activation/inactivation of ppmyb <dig> . similarly, considering that peach reference myb <dig>  gene using red peach cultivar ‘lovell’ possessed this insertion , we also assumed that 494-bp insertion in myb <dig> - <dig> did not relate to the function, but our 494-bp indel was found to associate with the red color index in  <dig> japanese cultivars. twenty-three japanese peach cultivars examined in this study share close genetic relationships to each other as you can see the several sports of ‘hakuto’ peach , which may explain why ppmyb <dig>  allelic types were associated with the red color indexes in skin of these cultivars.. therefore, we are not sure if our results can apply to other peach cultivars/strains especially other than japanese cultivars. by contrast, we also found other indels and many snps in the 5′-upstream, 3′-downstream, exons and introns in ppmyb <dig>  alleles of japanese peach cultivars. it suggested that the genomic structures of japanese peach cultivars are not completely similar with those of chinese peach cultivars  <cit> . at present, we have not yet determined the actual key sequence differences in myb <dig> - <dig> and myb <dig> - <dig> types that lead to the activation of myb <dig> - <dig> type. further surveys are required to establish the essential factors in dna sequences that directly contributed to the expression of ppmyb <dig>  in red-skinned peach.

CONCLUSIONS
we concluded that ppmyb <dig>  is a major regulator of anthocyanin accumulation in red-skinned peach and that a close relationships between ppmyb <dig>  allelic type and skin color phenotype . this finding will enable further investigation of dna sequences of ppmyb <dig> , providing essential information to establish dna markers linked to white- and red-skinned peach for fruit breeders.
