BACKGROUND
with the advances in dna microarray and the next-generation sequencing  technologies, transcriptomic profiling of biological samples can be obtained fast and cost effectively. the high-throughput genomic data enable systematic inference of gene regulatory networks   <cit> . in parallel, online databases, such as the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit>  and the pathway interaction database   <cit> , curate large volume of biologically  validated gene regulatory pairs. these grns and pathways provide overall landscape of complex genome-wide gene regulation in biological systems. however, these gene regulatory relationships are typically derived under a single condition in a single cell line/tissue. from biological intuition, cells undergoing changes in cell cycle, environment, or cellular stress, and cells of different disease types or disease subtypes may recruit differential signaling pathways in response of cellular stimulation. thus, strength and relationships of gene regulation are less likely to remain constitutive  among these cells . ideker and krogan proposed the scenario of "differential network biology" where grns and pathways can be massively rewired during adaptive cellular responses  <cit> . notably, dynamic interaction among proteins was shown to be predictive of breast cancer outcome  <cit> , implying that studying the dynamic changes in network topology, as the differentially expressed genes, can provide biological clues of complex diseases.

from the viewpoint of regulation under modulation, the dynamics of cellular conditions can be determined  by status of certain modulator genes. in other words, gene a regulates gene b under the modulation of c refers to the scenario where regulation strength between gene pair a and b is dependent on expression level of the modulator c. for instance, previous study identified genes that were predictive of patient prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas in the ras signature dependent manner  <cit> . also, competing endogenous rna  regulation, referring to genes sharing common targeting mirna that can regulate each other by competing for the limited pool of mirnas  <cit> , was shown to be modulated by expression levels of the common targeting mirnas  <cit> . in breast cancer, estrogen receptor  is the most well studied modulator in gene regulation. topological and temporal changes in grn of transcription factors were observed in mcf <dig> breast cancer cell line upon estradiol stimulation  <cit> . furthermore, the er encoding gene esr <dig> was shown to be capable of modulating coexpression among a handful of genes  <cit> . in order to systematically investigate gene regulation modulated by individual modulator genes, comprehensive mathematical methods were developed and carried out biologically testable findings  <cit> .

gene regulation under modulation provides an alternative layer of gene regulatory networks. however, since gene regulation involves complex mechanism, especially in cancer, analysis based on individual modulator genes may be limited in understanding joint effects among multiple modulators and unveiling the landscape of modulation. addressing this, in the present study we investigated the joint  effects of modulator genes in determining genome-wide gene regulation strength. here we propose the covariability-based multiple regression  method to model the relationships between multiple modulator genes and modulated gene-gene regulation in breast cancer. comre was built mainly based on the multiple regression analysis which takes expression levels of modulators as model inputs and strength of gene-gene regulation, measured by our developed parameter "covariability", as output. on the other hand, investigation into functions governed by gene modulation in breast cancer remains largely unexplored. thus, we further analyzed and interpreted the results identified by comre in the systematic functional level. collectively, the present study is aimed to statistically infer the relationship between multiple modulators and modulated gene regulation and to study the associated biological functions in breast cancer.

RESULTS
model overview of comre
in the present study we aim to statistically infer the relationship between multiple modulators and modulated gene regulation  and dissect biological functions governed by it in breast cancer. here the modulated gene regulation refers to the scenario where regulation strength between two genes is specifically intensified when the modulator gene is highly up-regulated or down-regulated. we proposed the comre algorithm to carry out the analysis. figure 1b illustrates the analysis flowchart of comre. the comre algorithm is mainly composed of a multiple regression model that takes expression levels of the modulator genes as regressors  and the regulation strength of a modulated gene pair as regressand . here we designed the "covariability" measure to model regulation strength between two genes in each sample. the covariability is simply the per-sample contribution into the pearson correlation coefficient of genes i and j. from biological aspect, the covariability measures the magnitude of changes in two genes in the same direction in one sample; i.e., positive  covariability with greater magnitude is indicative of larger changes in two genes in the same  direction. mathematical details of comre are provided in the methods section.

in this study we analyzed the gene expression dataset from  <dig> lymph-node negative breast cancer patients  . after removing non-informative and background probe sets , we selected  <dig>  probes representing  <dig>  unique genes for consequent analysis. current knowledge of modulator genes in breast cancer is very limited. thus, besides the well-studied modulator gene estrogen receptor  <dig> , in the list of candidate modulator genes we exploratorily included  <dig> more candidate genes that were recorded as association with "breast tumor progression" in the knowledge-based database ingenuity pathway analysis . ten modulator genes analyzed in this study are listed in table  <dig>  these genes play crucial roles and execute complex functions in breast cancer; thus we reason their functions can be performed partially through modulation of gene regulation. we applied comre to investigate effects of the  <dig> candidate modulator genes in modulating pairwise gene regulation in the microarray dataset. for each pair of genes, comre outputs a co-modulation pattern, which is composed of ten-length vectors of regression β values and p-values. by studying all combinations of the  <dig>  genes , we then elucidated the effects of individual modulator genes and the cooperative  interaction among them in modulation. furthermore, we explored enriched functions in the modulated gene pairs carrying distinct co-modulation patterns. to test the reproducibility of results identified by comre, we also included two independent cohorts  as validation datasets.

a gene information was obtained from ingenuity pathway analysis .

dissecting individual effects of modulator genes in modulating gene regulation
for each of the  <dig> , <dig> gene pairs, comre analyzes how the  <dig> candidate modulator genes interact to determine regulation strength between the pair of genes, and outputs a co-modulation pattern. the covariability of all gene pairs was approximately normally distributed, with the mean, maximum and minimum values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , - <dig> , respectively . among the  <dig> , <dig> co-modulation patterns, regression p-values  were roughly uniformly distributed . the distribution of regression β values approximately followed the normal distribution . taken together, these observations indicate that the comre method provides an unbiased statistical model. we set the criteria of multiple regression p-value <  <dig>  to identify significant modulator genes for each gene pair. regulation strength of  <dig> , <dig>  gene pairs was modulated by neither of the  <dig> candidate modulator genes. the other  <dig> , <dig>  gene pairs showed significant dependence on the total count of  <dig> , <dig> candidate modulator genes; on average, each gene pair is modulated by ~ <dig>  modulators. a great majority  of all gene pairs were modulated by less than  <dig> modulator genes. figure 2d is the histogram of number of significant modulator genes in each gene pair. interestingly, only one pair of genes, keratin  <dig>  and n-acetylneuraminic acid synthase , was significantly modulated by all of the candidate modulators. also, there were  <dig> pairs of genes modulated by nine of the ten modulators, including the pair of forkhead box a <dig>  and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  <dig> . foxa <dig>  encoding a forkhead dna-binding protein, is well-known to associate the luminal subtype and favorable prognosis in breast cancer  <cit> . fbp <dig> was reported to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition  in the basal-like subtype  <cit>  and included in the widely used 70-gene expression predictor for breast cancer prognosis  <cit> . altogether, we elucidate that foxa <dig> may have highly modulated, thus "dynamic" across samples, regulatory relationship with fbp <dig>  contributing to these two genes' roles in prognosis in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

among the  <dig> candidate modulator genes, notably, the well-studied modulator gene esr <dig> was found significantly modulating the most number of gene pairs , followed by v-erb-b <dig> avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog  <dig>  and adam metallopeptidase domain  <dig>  . together with progesterone receptor , er and her <dig>  are genes currently used for molecular subtyping of breast cancers. the results indicate that the two genes define distinct molecular characteristics in breast cancer partially through modulation of gene regulation. among the modulator genes, reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs , tumor protein p <dig> , and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , were found to modulate the least numbers of gene pairs ,  <dig>  , and  <dig> , <dig>  gene pairs, respectively; figure 2e). although these genes are related to essential functions of breast tumor progression, they may possess relatively minor, or overtaken by other candidate modulators, effects in modulation of gene regulation. to generate a random baseline of our results, we replaced the inputs of modulator expression levels with ten randomly simulated variables and reran the analyses. each of the ten random variables showed significance only in  <dig> % to  <dig> %, approximating the p-value cutoff of  <dig> , of the  <dig> , <dig> gene pairs. taken together, our data suggest the capability of comre in identifying both biologically well-known results and novel insights into other candidate modulator genes.

investigating joint effects of multiple modulator genes in modulating gene regulation and related biological functions
to understand the joint effects of the  <dig> candidate modulators, we analyzed pairwise co-occurrence as significant modulators among the genome-wide gene pairs; i.e., we statistically inferred whether gene pairs modulated by one modulator gene are highly overlapped with those modulated by another modulator. interestingly,  <dig>  pairs of modulators showed significant positive co-occurrence ; i.e., gene pairs modulated by one modulator tended to be also modulated by another modulator. only  <dig>  modulator pairs exhibited significant negative association , including adam12−mk <dig>  adam12−tp <dig>  ccl5−tp <dig>  esr1−mif, mif−mk <dig>  and mif−tp <dig>  ccl5−reck and erbb2−mk <dig> showed negative pairwise association with borderline significance .

we further grouped all the gene pairs based on their co-modulation patterns  so that gene pairs significantly modulated by the same set of modulators were grouped. groups accounting for more than 5% of all gene pairs are tabulated in table  <dig>  in order to further realize underlying functions among genes in each group, we analyzed the parameter of node degree for genes as defined in graph theory. node degree of a gene is defined as the number of first-order  neighbor genes connected to it. genes with high degrees are considered as "central" players  in a gene regulatory network. the top three genes with highest node degrees in each group are tabulated in table  <dig>  as we described above, the largest group  was composed of gene pairs that were not modulated by any of the  <dig> modulators. interestingly, groups of gene pairs that were modulated by single modulators  were found with higher frequencies than those modulated by multiple modulators. gene pairs that were modulated merely by esr <dig> were found as the second largest group . top  <dig> hub genes in the esr <dig> modulated network were nuclear factor i/x , sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase, acid-like 3a , and vascular endothelial growth factor a , with direct connection to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nodes, respectively. in breast cancer, while function of nfix was previously uncharacterized, smpdl3a was reported to be dysregulated by progesterone treatment in hormone-independent breast cancer cells  <cit>  and metastatic mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines  <cit> . furthermore, vegfa has been widely known for its roles in angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth. in breast cancer, studies demonstrated that vegfa can prolong tumor cell survival  <cit>  and its gene variation is associated with patient overall survival  <cit> . our data further demonstrated that, potentially, the three hub genes' functions may be altered, fully or partially, under esr <dig> modulation. to gain insights into biological functions governed by esr <dig> modulation, we used the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig>  web tool to identify significantly enriched gene ontology  terms of molecular functions and biological processes. for extracting biologically core information from the group, here only  <dig>  "core" esr <dig> modulated gene pairs  composed of  <dig> genes were analyzed . the top three clusters of enriched go terms were i) dna metabolic process and response to dna damage, ii) identical protein binding, and iii) response to estrogen and steroid hormone stimulus . during early tumorigenesis, effective dna damage responses  can trigger cellular apoptosis and thus serve as candidate anti-cancer barrier  <cit> . also, since response to estrogen stimulus  typically recruits downstream signaling genes of estrogen receptor, our results suggest esr <dig> performs its functions, at least partly, by modulating these downstream genes. overall, these data illuminated the importance of esr <dig> modulation in breast cancer.

complex and tight interplay of esr <dig> and erbb <dig> modulation
in the list of groups of co-modulation patterns, esr1−erbb <dig> co-modulation was identified as the most frequent group with multiple modulators . the group accounted for  <dig>  gene pairs  and had the top hub genes of melanoma inhibitory activity , keratin 6b ; fyve and coiled-coil domain containing  <dig> . while the role of mia remains unexplored in breast cancer, it is predictive of malignant melanoma progression and metastasis  <cit> . krt6b is a basal specific marker in breast cancer  <cit> . presence of and interaction between er and her <dig> define molecular subtypes of breast cancer and are associated with resistance to tamoxifen, a selective er modifier  . here we showed that their encoding genes, esr <dig> and erbb <dig>  also interact with each other and co-modulate regulation among a wide range of genes. again, we used david to analyze the  <dig> core gene pairs comprised of  <dig> genes in the esr1−erbb <dig> co-modulation group and identified similar results as in esr <dig> modulation. the top three enriched groups of go terms were i) response to hormone stimulus, ii) oxidation reduction and cofactor binding, and iii) identical protein binding . notably, the core modulated genes in the erbb2-alone group were enriched in highly similar go terms . the core modulated genes of the esr <dig> alone, erbb <dig> alone, and esr1−erbb <dig> co-modulation groups were significantly overlapped . interestingly, all of the esr1−erbb <dig> co-modulated core genes were included in the esr <dig> or erbb <dig> groups . taken together, our data indicate that a highly common pool of genes is modulated by the two modulators while massive rewiring among these genes exists across different conditions . we elucidate that esr <dig> and erbb <dig> have complex and tight interplay in the aspect of gene modulation, through which identical biological functions are performed.

external validation of co-modulation patterns
in order to test the reproducibility and reliability of comre among different cohorts, we analyzed two independent breast cancer datasets, gse <dig> and gse <dig>  for validation. based on the co-modulation patterns  obtained from gse <dig>  we computed the "estimated" covariability profile for each patient in the two validation datasets using corresponding expression data of the modulator genes. the real covariability profiles were calculated using global gene expression data in each of the validation datasets. notably, the estimated and real covariability profiles were significantly positively correlated  in  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of patients in gse <dig> and gse <dig>  respectively. similarly, for esr1−erbb <dig> co-modulated gene pairs, the results were validated in 100%  and  <dig> %  of patients. the data suggest the stability of modulation effects among different cohorts and the reproducibility of results identified by comre.

limitations and future work
by far validation of modulator genes through biological experiments is very limited. in breast cancer, er is the most well-studied modulator gene. in the present study, in addition to the er encoding gene esr <dig>  we exploratorily included  <dig> more genes related to essential functions in breast tumor progression, with previously undiscovered function of modulation. our data first validated the role of esr <dig> as a modulator gene and suggested that it may jointly work with other modulators. also, the results implied the existence of other modulators genes in breast cancer, such as erbb <dig> and adam <dig>  however, ~37% of gene pairs were not modulated by any of the  <dig> candidate modulators, suggestive of the need for inclusion of other modulators. we have demonstrated the performance of comre and the benefits to study modulation in the joint manner. with advances in biological exploration of modulator genes, comre can be employed to reveal more biologically meaningful findings.

investigation of casual relationships between genes is one of the crucial topics in regulatory biology. indeed, correlation coefficients, as well as mutual information, are not capable of measuring causal relationships between factors. however, analyses of modulated gene regulation typically focus on how expression levels of modulators affect regulating strength, instead of the causal relationships, between modulated genes. previous studies have used non-causal statistical methods to reach comprehensive results in single modulator analyses  <cit> . in this study, our objective is to extend the analysis to inferring multiple modulators co-modulated gene regulation, using a correlation-based regression approach. therefore, comre was designed to evaluate how co-variability of genome-wide gene pairs was dependent on modulator genes based on a multiple regression model; the analysis was focused on modulation, rather than direct or causal regulation, or co-regulation .

comre is built on the basis of a multiple linear regression model. in statistics, multiple regression analysis typically assumes the independence among input variables . however, biological intuition is that two genes can hardly be independent to each other in cells. in previous studies, multiple regression model has been widely utilized to study genes  <cit> , different data types   <cit> , and survival significance of multiple genomic features   <cit> . findings of these reports suggest that multiple regression can achieve biologically meaningful results, in spite of the moderate dependency of genomic features. thus, we followed these literatures and designed comre to study multi-modulator modulation. future efforts may be spent on developing algorithms that can take dependent genomic features and enable statistically more meaningful inference.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we presented the comre algorithm for systematically investigating how multiple modulator genes jointly determine pairwise regulation strength of modulated genes. the algorithm was designed based on a multiple regression model for gene-gene covariability that measures how two genes regulate each other in each patient. among the ten candidate modulator genes, the positive control esr <dig> and two genes with essential functions in breast cancer were found modulating the most numbers of gene pairs. through functional annotation analysis, we showed that genes modulated by merely single modulator or co-modulated by multiple modulators play important roles in breast cancer. we elucidate that esr <dig> and erbb <dig> share complex interplay between each other in the aspect of gene modulation. we also demonstrated that the co-modulation patterns are stably retained and the results identified by comre are highly reproducible among different cohorts. from the viewpoint of multi-modulator modulation, this study paves the way for better understanding complex gene regulation in breast cancer.
