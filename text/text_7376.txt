BACKGROUND
domoic acid  is an ampa/kainate receptor ligand that elicits a very rapid and potent neurotoxic response, and as such, has been used as a reliable research tool to investigate excitotoxic damage in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit> . the hippocampus, among other brain regions, has been identified as a specific target site having high sensitivity to dom-induced toxicity  <cit>  and, at lower doses, to dom-induced structural plasticity relevant to temporal lobe epilepsy  <cit> . we have previously reported that mild excitotoxicity produced by low concentrations of dom was reversible and accompanied by a corresponding increase in the baseline rate of neurogenesis in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures   <cit> . however, the intracellular mechanisms responsible for cell proliferation and neurogenesis after transient excitotoxic insult remain unclear.

bdnf is a member of the neurotrophin family that plays important roles in many developmentally regulated processes, such as cell survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity of neurons as well as neurogenesis. some studies reveal that different forms of excitatory cellular stimulation can enhance bdnf synthesis and secretion  <cit>  and, accordingly, low doses of dom during postnatal development have been proven to induce significant increases in hippocampal bdnf expression as well as in its high-affinity receptor, the tropomyosin-related kinase b  in the resulting adult animals  <cit> . one of the most well know transcriptional regulators of bdnf gene expression is the cyclic amp responsive element binding protein ; activation of which can be mediated by the camp-dependent protein kinase , the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway or the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases , among others, depending on the activating signal and cell type  <cit> . these kinases have been reported to mediate cell proliferation and neurogenesis as well as neurite outgrowth, synaptic transmission and neuronal survival in a number of model systems  <cit>  and specifically to promote hippocampal neurogenesis both in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit> .

ohsc preserve normal hippocampal anatomical structure and functional properties in vitro for several weeks  <cit>  and provide an alternative model to the hippocampus in vivo that is accessible to extensive manipulation  <cit> . as all types of neurons and glia are preserved with their specific morphologies and localizations, the hippocampal neuronal network organization is very similar to that of the living animal  <cit> . accordingly, in the current experiments we tested the hypothesis that transient exposure to a low concentration of dom would enhance bdnf expression in cultured hippocampal slices. further, we aimed to utilize this in vitro system to investigate the activation of key intracellular pathways mediating neuronal proliferation after a mild excitotoxic insult.

RESULTS
dom induced overexpression of bdnf and trkb
to examine whether dom treatment increases bdnf expression in ohsc, preparations were treated with  <dig> μm dom for  <dig> h , changed to a dom-free medium and subjected to immunoblot analysis at different times after exposure as summarized in figure 1a. no significant changes in bdnf levels were found immediately after dom insult ; however,  <dig> h post-insult, bdnf levels were significantly increased  as compared with non-treated slices. dom treatment induced a maximum increase in bdnf expression  <dig> days post-insult  compared to age-matched control slices and this increase was maintained up to  <dig> days post-insult .

because bdnf signals primarily through its high-affinity receptor trkb, expression levels of the trkb protein were measured in both control and dom-treated ohsc . dom insult led to a sustained increase in the expression of trkb that was first detected at  <dig> hours post insult and was sustained throughout the  <dig> day period .

to determine which cell types overexpressed bdnf following transient dom treatment, we performed double immunostaining for bdnf and the microglial marker cd11b , the neuronal marker neun  or the astroglial marker gfap . under resting conditions microglial cells expressed basal levels of bdnf and had highly ramified fine processes, but when activated by the excitotoxin, they changed to an amoeboid phagocytic-like morphology and overexpressed bdnf . this can be seen in figure 2a  as double-labelling in the lower left quadrant of the image whereas bdnf expression from other cell type  is apparent in the upper right quadrant of the same image. similarly, bdnf immunoreactivity in both control and dom-treated groups was also observed in neun-positive cells  while only a reduced number of gfap-positive cells expressed the neurotrophin .

dom activates erk1/ <dig>  pka and camkii signaling pathways in hippocampal slices
next, to examine the cellular pathways activated by dom, phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  pka and camkii was examined by western blot analysis. dom insult  led to an increased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> , with significant activation relative to baseline levels starting  <dig> h post-insult , reaching peak levels at  <dig> hpi  and being sustained throughout the  <dig> h period . phospho-pka  activation was also significantly increased in ohsc following dom insult . protein phosphorylation was significantly increased immediately following the insult , and reached peak expression at  <dig> hpi . these results indicate that both erk and pka reached peak activation prior to maximal increases in bdnf and trkb receptor expression .

phospho-camkii  levels also increased significantly over the  <dig> h period . p-camkii levels were significantly increased relative to control levels with peak activation starting at  <dig> hpi .

inhibitors of mek and pka pathways suppress dom-stimulated increases in bdnf expression
to examine if the erk, the pka or the camkii pathways are involved in dom-induced bdnf overexpression in ohsc, we treated the cultures with the mapkk /erk kinase  inhibitor pd <dig>  the pka inhibitor h <dig> or the camkii inhibitor kn <dig>  to confirm that camkii, pka and erk pathways are reliably inhibited by the compounds listed above at the concentration used, we measured the levels of activation of the corresponding proteins after the application of these agents. the slices were exposed to the inhibitors  <dig> h before dom treatment. the results are summarized in additional file  <dig>  interestingly, dom-stimulated camkii activation was prevented by the mek inhibitor pd <dig> . coincubation of dom and pd <dig>  but not h <dig>  decreased camkii phosphorylation relative to that elicited by dom. dom-induced activation of erk was prevented by neither kn <dig> nor h <dig> . hippocampal slices co-incubated with h <dig> or pd <dig> elicited p-pka levels that were not significantly lower than those measured by dom alone .

to test whether the erk pathway is involved in dom-induced bdnf overexpression in ohsc the mek inhibitor pd <dig> was added to the cultured slices  <dig> h before dom treatment . western blot analysis demonstrated that pd <dig>  when coincubated with dom, significantly decreased dom-stimulated upregulation of bdnf expression . we then used a similar approach to examine the involvement of the pka pathway on the overexpression of bdnf after dom insult. although not as effective as pd <dig>  the pka inhibitor h <dig> reduced by approximately 45% the dom-stimulated upregulation of bdnf . taken together, these results suggest that the dom-induced rise in bdnf levels is largely both erk and pka-dependent. on the other hand, the camkii inhibitor kn <dig> failed to suppress or reduce the increased expression of bdnf induced by the transient injury .

dom stimulates hippocampal creb activation
both bdnf and trkb gene expression are known to be upregulated through phosphorylation of the transcription factor creb  <cit> . since creb activation has been proven to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis  <cit> , as has a low concentration of dom  <cit> , we investigated whether phosphorylated creb  was up-regulated in ohsc by dom insult. the total amount of creb and p-creb in control and dom-treated slices was determined by western blotting . organotypic slices were exposed to  <dig> μm dom and returned to dom-free culture medium after  <dig> h . we found that the insult increased creb phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. the increase was first detected immediately after termination of the dom insult ) and reached peak activation  <dig> hpi , remaining elevated until the end of the experiment .

there is ample evidence that the mapk signaling pathway is involved in the phosphorylation of creb to promote neuronal survival and protection  <cit> . in the current study, the mek inhibitor pd <dig> significantly decreased p-creb levels  compared to the increase elicited by dom alone . the observed increase in p-creb immunoreactivity in ohsc after dom insult was also down-regulated when dom was combined with the pka inhibitor h <dig> . on the other hand, when coincubated with dom, kn <dig>  a well-known camkii inhibitor, failed to block the increase in p-creb at either time-point evaluated . none of these treatments altered the protein expression of creb.

neurogenesis is up-regulated via activation of both the pka and the mek pathway
as described above, blocking the mek pathway with pd <dig> or the pka pathway with h <dig> significantly attenuated dom-induced overexpression of bdnf, but neither antagonist alone was able to restore immunoreactivity to control levels . concurrent exposure of cultured slices to pd <dig> and h <dig> 1h before dom treatment completely blocked the dom-stimulated increase in bdnf expression in ohsc . when pd <dig> and h <dig> were combined with dom, p-creb levels were also comparable to untreated controls . these data suggest that both the pka and the erk pathways are stimulating p-creb phosphorylation and the subsequent production of bdnf in parallel.

we have reported previously that dom insult  resulted in increased neurogenesis in ohsc  <cit> . in order to evaluate the potential role of mek and pka activation pathways, ohsc were treated with pd <dig> or h <dig> 1h prior to dom insult. we performed western blot analysis for doublecortin , a microtubule-associated protein widely expressed exclusively in neural progenitor cells that, as we have reported previously using immunohistochemistry  <cit> , was significant upregulated after dom insult. analysis of lysates revealed that dom insult increased significantly dcx expression , confirming the previously published immunohistochemistry results  <cit> . western blots further demonstrated that the mek inhibitor significantly decreased the dom-stimulated upregulation of dcx expression . on the other hand, when coincubated with dom, the pka inhibitor failed to block the dcx increase . coapplication of pd <dig> and h <dig>  <dig> h before dom treatment led to a greater decrease in dcx levels . this additive effect suggest that pka and erk activate the dcx pathway independently in ohsc after dom insult and that erk is, to some degree, capable of compensating for the inhibition of pka.

discussion
in a previous study, we demonstrated that a mild reversible injury to the hippocampal ca <dig> subfield induced by a low concentration of dom increases neurogenesis in both the dentate gyrus and the ca <dig> subfields of ohsc  <cit> . neuronal injury can lead to neural proliferation as a compensatory mechanism for cell death in the hippocampus  <cit>  and growth and mitogenic factors, such as bdnf, play a prominent role in proliferation and neurogenesis after excitotoxicity  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated whether dom alters bdnf expression after transient insult and explored the key intracellular signaling mechanisms by which dom modulates neurogenesis. our results showed that dom insult upregulated bdnf expression by activation of both mapk and pka cascades and that these two pathways mediate, at least in part, the increased neural proliferation resulting after mild excitotoxicity.

exposure to  <dig> μm dom for  <dig> h  followed by recovery induced a significant and long lasting increase in bdnf protein levels in ohsc. bdnf is a member of the neurotrophin family widely distributed in the brain with the highest levels in the hippocampus  <cit> . it has been previously reported that excitotoxicity and seizure activity induce an overexpression of hippocampal bdnf at both protein and mrna levels  <cit> . bdnf signals primarily through its high-affinity receptor trkb that promotes neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and cell survival  <cit> , and plays an important role in the development and plasticity of the brain  <cit> . consistent with the observed increase in bndf expression, dom insult also induced trkb upregulation. although trkb phosphorylation, which was not assessed in the current study, is required for receptor-mediated signaling, a number of recent papers have reported that increases in both bdnf and trkb expression correlate with functionally-relevant downstream effects both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> . thus, dom-induced changes in growth factors and/or their receptors could stimulate the increased cell birth observed after excitotoxicity.

to determine the cellular source of increased bdnf we performed double-label immunohistochemistry in the ca <dig> hippocampal subfield. although the response of progenitor cells in different hippocampal regions may vary  we have shown previously that the ca <dig> region is particularly sensitive to both excitotoxic damage by dom and shows robust microglial activation whereas other regions  do not  <cit> . our observation that bdnf is overexpressed in ca <dig> not only by neurons but also by microglial cells  is in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , which highlights the importance of microglial cells as a source of bdnf following injury. examination of the image presented in figure 2a  shows clear double-labelling of bdnf and cd11b in the lower left quadrant while cells in the upper right quadrant  express only bdnf. further, the image shows that the two cell types are in very close proximity in this region. therefore, we suggest that under mild excitotoxic conditions both neurons and microglia will respond with an increase in the production and release of bdnf.

clinical and basic evidence supports the idea that abnormalities in brain neuronal regeneration assisted by bdnf are associated with a wide range of disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric or stress-related conditions . our laboratory has reported previously that low concentrations of dom administered in vivo during perinatal development cause permanent alterations in both behaviour and hippocampal structure consistent with many animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy as well as what is found in the human condition. increased expression of both bdnf  <cit>  and its corresponding trkb receptor  <cit>  were found in the hippocampus of dom treated rats. thus, the changes observed in ohsc in the current study are consistent with observations in vivo. the organotypic hippocampal slice culture system, however, provided us the means by which to evaluate the intracellular mechanism of enhanced bdnf expression initiated by transient dom injury. using immunobloting of specific signaling intermediates, we followed three important intracellular cascades: the mapk, the pka and the camkii pathways.

dom insult led to increased p-erk1/ <dig> ; two signaling proteins activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway. erk1/ <dig>  promote growth and modulate differentiation and survival via transcriptional regulation. erk activation in ohsc was increased immediately following dom exposure, reaching peak expression at  <dig> h post insult. dom also caused a significant upregulation of p-pka levels. increases in intracellular ca2+ by activation of nmda receptors, ampa/kainate receptors, or calcium channels increases intracellular cyclic amp  through activation of adenylyl cyclases that will result in the activation of pka  <cit> . in addition to the increased p-erk and p-pka our results also demonstrated significant activation of camkii in ohsc. other studies have reported a pivotal role for both pka and camkii activation after long-lasting potentiation induced by a brief dom treatment  <cit>  and administration of dom at doses that produce no major observable behavioral changes has been previously shown to increase significantly camkii phosphorylation  <cit> . therefore, these results suggest that alterations in intracellular signaling pathways might be a protective mechanism against dom-induced excitotoxic damage.

ca2+-mediated signaling pathways tightly modulate bdnf expression mainly through the transcription factor creb  <cit> . in conjunction with the observed increase in bdnf and trkb, dom insult was found to stimulate activation of creb in hippocampal cultures. several studies have proven that creb activation requires serine- <dig> phosphorylation, which can be mediated by pka, mapk pathway or camks, among others, depending on the activating signal and cell type  <cit> . in the current experiments, inhibitors of both mek and pka attenuated the dom-stimulated activation of creb as well as upregulation of bdnf. in contrast, the camkii inhibitor failed to prevent or significantly decrease any of the protein changes observed. these data strongly suggest that transient dom exposure in hippocampal cultured slices upregulates creb-dependent transcription of bdnf by activating the mapk and pka pathways rather than the camkii cascade. erk activation has been previously associated with the transcription factor creb in cultured hippocampal neurons and brain slices  <cit>  and as mapk signaling is required for prolonged creb phosphorylation  <cit> , it has been suggested that mapk signalling might be highly relevant for the activation of creb-dependent transcription. it has also been reported that pka regulation of transcription via creb is implicated in brain plasticity, learning and memory  <cit> . our results showed that the dom-induced increases in bdnf expression and creb phosphorylation were completely blocked with concurrent exposure to pka and mek inhibitors. we further explored whether crosstalk between the pka and erk pathways might also play a role in the observed activation of creb following dom insult. although evidence of coupling between these signaling pathways has been provided previously in vivo and in vitro  <cit>  no evidence was found in ohsc after dom insult; namely, the mek inhibitor pd <dig> failed to modulate pka pathway activation and no significant changes were found in p-erk levels after concurrent exposure to the pka inhibitor h <dig> and dom compared to exposure to dom alone. together, these pieces of evidence suggest that the pka- and mek-activated pathways are operating in parallel in this system and converge upon creb, leading to bdnf overexpression. an interesting but currently unexplained finding from our experiments was that the dom-induced increase in camkii was attenuated with mek inhibition. it has been previously described that camkii, as an upstream kinase, interacts with raf, modulating the activation of erk proteins  <cit>  but, to our knowledge, there is no previous evidence of erk acting as an upstream regulator of camkii phosphorylation in the cns. the observed phenomenon and its implications should be investigated further in a future study.

a major goal of this study was to elucidate the relationship between pka/ mapk pathways and the increased neurogenesis we reported previously in ohsc using both immunostaining and dcx positive cell counts  <cit> . as shown in figure 7b, analysis by western blot revealed that concurrent chemical inhibition of pka and mek activation specifically attenuated the increase in the neuroblast cell marker dcx. in accordance with the results obtained in the present study, these kinases have been reported to mediate growth factor-induced neurogenesis and neuroprotection  <cit> . the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  is activated by mek in response to growth stimuli  <cit>  and much evidence exists that the erk pathway plays a role in progenitor cell proliferation or differentiation in a number of model systems. for example, the erk pathway is involved in neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival induced by either neurotrophic factors  <cit>  or pharmacological agents such as valproate  <cit>  or lithium  <cit>  and it has been proven that erk activation promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro <cit> . similarly, pka regulation of transcription via creb has been associated with growth factor-dependent neurogenesis, cell survival, synaptic transmission and cognitive function in the nervous system  <cit> .

phosphorylation of creb and overexpression of bdnf have been implicated in the regulation of the expression of many genes and cellular processes important in brain function  <cit>  and the up-regulation of hippocampal cell proliferation  <cit> . we have previously shown that neurogenesis after dom insult in ohsc occurred primarily during the first week of exposure in both the subgranular zone of the hippocampus and in the ca <dig> hippocampal subfield, with a decreasing tendency clearly observed over the next days  <cit> . in the current study, dom insult induced a significant long lasting increase in bdnf protein levels in ohsc that was sustained throughout the  <dig> day period, although in the current study we did not determine if this effect was regionally selective. bdnf is one of the most studied extrinsic factors that not only promotes neurogenesis, but also regulates dendrite outgrowth  <cit> , increases proximal dendrite growth and number in pyramidal neurons  <cit>  and promotes synaptogenesis  <cit>  and neuronal survival during development  <cit> . our results suggest that bdnf in ohsc may be promoting neurogenesis as well as maturation and integration of new neurons after dom insult, although the specific hippocampal regions at which these neurons originate, whether they in fact migrate to, or originate in, areas of transient damage, and whether they are capable of restoring normal function to the resulting circuitry needs to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that transient excitotoxic insult induced by dom promotes sustained bdnf and trkb overexpression in ohsc as well as increased hippocampal neurogenesis. enhancement in bdnf protein levels and over-phosphorylation of its transcription factor creb occurred via two distinct and independent signalling cascades, mek and pka pathways, which may be critical for hippocampal recovery after the transient dom insult due to their role in the neurogenic process.
