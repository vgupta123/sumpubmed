BACKGROUND
protein-ligand binding is important for some proteins to perform their functions. protein-ligand binding sites are the residues of proteins that physically bind to ligands. a ligand is a signal triggering molecule, binding to a site on a target protein. in biochemistry, a ligand is a substance, usually a small molecule, that forms a complex always with a molecule to serve a biological purpose. for instance, oxygen is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions and cannot be perfectly carried to tissues if it is only dissolved in blood serum. however, none of the amino acid side chains in proteins is suited for the reversible binding of oxygen molecules. the function is always fulfilled by certain transition metals having a strong tendency to bind oxygen, such as iron and copper. most commonly iron is used for the oxygen transportation. myoglobin  is an iron- and oxygen-binding protein to facilitate the oxygen diffusion in muscles. it is a single polypeptide consisted of  <dig> or  <dig> amino acid residues, which is found in almost all mammals, primarily in muscle tissue. commonly, there are several ligand categories: "metal ions" , "inorganic anions" , "dna/rna" for poly-ribonucleic acid binding sites, and "organic ligands" for cofactors, substrates, and receptor agonists/antagonists   <cit> , and so on.

a number of methods applied nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy  <cit>  or x-ray  <cit>  to determining protein structures. such structural information is essential to determine the ligand-binding sites. pintacuda et al. employed lanthanide ions for the determination of protein-ligand binding sites  <cit> . ziarek et al. emphasized a semi-automated throughput-focused method to identify practical aspects of binding site characterization and structure determination of protein-ligand complexes, by automated and semi-automated nmr assignment methods  <cit> . since experimental efforts to determine ligand-binding sites are always time-consuming, computational methods are needed that can assist in the identification of such sites.

most computational approaches searched for similar or homologous structures of the query sequence to determine its ligand-binding sites from the homologous structures  <cit> . for instance, in the casp <dig> competition, all top performing groups were based on the structure-based approach. although they yielded good predictions , such structure-based techniques are restricted by the limited number of available protein structures. therefore, sequence-based approaches are particulary useful when similar structural information is not available. a number of sequence-based methods have been developed to predict ligand-binding states  <cit> . passerini and co-workers introduced a method for identifying histidines  and cysteines  that participated in binding of several transition metals and iron complexes  <cit> . shu et al. developed a method combining support vector machines  and homology-based predictions to predict zinc-binding sites  in proteins from their amino acid sequences  <cit> . moreover, some sequence-based predictors attended the casp <dig> competition  <cit> .

however, the problem of whether ligand-binding sites can be predicted from sequence information remains open. little progress has been made on the sequence-based ligand-binding site prediction. kauffman and karypis proposed a method that combined machine learning and homology information for the sequence-based ligand-binding site prediction  <cit> . however, the method did not perform well. in this paper, we propose a sequence-based approach, ligandrfs , to identify protein-ligand binding residues based on the co-evolutionary context of amino acid residues. first, due to the imbalanced samples between ligand-binding sites and non-binding sites, several data sets are constructed. each of them is composed of the binding site subset  and part of the non-binding site subset . all the negative subsets are disjoint with each other. then a random forest  classifier is learned on each data set. experiments on the casp <dig> and casp <dig> data sets show that the consensus of these rf classifiers can yield good prediction on ligand-binding sites.

RESULTS
we first analyzed the amino acid preferences for ligand binding sites and non-ligand binding sites. figure  <dig> illustrates the preference comparison. it can be seen that amino acids, asp, gly and his, frequently occur in the ligand binding sites, while amino acids, leu and ala, are often regarded as non-ligand binding sites. however, it may not always be the case because our current data set is relatively small. despite of that, asp and his are considered as hydrophilic amino acids while leu and ala as hydrophobic ones in literature  <cit> , which is partially in agreement with our statistics. in fact, hydrophilic amino acids seem to be more likely to be ligand binding sites.

prediction results on casp9
in this work, we first used casp <dig> data set to train our method and then test it on casp <dig> protein ligand data set, both of the two data sets involve the same definition of protein ligand binding site. also we use sliding window to encode the input vector for each residue of the protein, which is then inputted into a classifier to determine whether or not it is a ligand binding site. by using the sliding window with length seven, table  <dig> shows the performance comparison of the  <dig> rf classifiers and that of the ensemble, on the prediction of all ligand binding sites that was extended to include the entire biologically relevant ligand. from table  <dig> it can be seen that the ensemble of the  <dig> rf classifiers with majority voting performs well. it yields an mcc of  <dig>  and an f1-score of  <dig> %, which outperforms any individual rf classifier, where the best individual prediction, the 2nd classifier, achieves an mcc of  <dig>  and an f <dig> of  <dig> %.

the left part shows the performance of each individual classifier, and the right shows the performance of the ensemble of the  <dig> classifiers with different votes, i.e., the ensemble predicts a residue to be ligand binding site if a number of rf classifiers predict it to be a ligand binding site residue. here the ensemble with majority vote predicts a residue to be ligand binding site if all of the  <dig> rf classifiers predict it to be a binding residue.

the italic number denotes the best performance by the measure of mcc.

moreover, other sliding windows for the input encoding are conducted here. table  <dig> shows prediction performance on different sliding windows and two ligand binding site groups: partial ligand sites including those only being in contact with atoms of the partial ligands, and all ligand sites including those being in contact with all atoms of the partial and the extended ligands. among the different sliding windows in table  <dig> window  <dig> performs the best in the case of the all ligand site group, while window  <dig> performs the best for the partial ligand site group. to reduce the effects of sliding window selection in encoding for input vectors, the combination technique  is used and the performance is listed at the last row of the table  <dig> respectively for the two binding site groups. it seems that the combination technique can reduce the effects of sliding window selection and achieves a little improvement.

it contains prediction performance on the all ligand site group and the partial ligand site group. the ensemble of all sliding windows is shown at the last row of the table.

the italic number denotes the best performance on the measure of mcc.

we also output the prediction performance for each target in casp <dig> and the details are shown in table  <dig>  the final prediction performance on casp <dig> data set is obtained by the average of all the targets. our predictor yields different performances over the data set, some targets obtaining good predictions and some ones performing worse. statistics from table  <dig> protein targets bound to metal ligands perform better than those bound to non-metal ions. experiments showed that template-based prediction methods will perform much better than de novo methods in the context  <cit> . however, for targets t <dig> and t <dig>  both of which are free modeling  targets, our prediction on t <dig> performs much better than that on t <dig>  the reason is seemingly that the target t <dig> is bound to metal ligands while t <dig> is bound to non-metal ligands. it should be noted that the ratio of the number of binding sites to the total number of residues of the target is not a significant factor on the prediction performance of our de novo method. it can be seen that the average ratios for metal binding sites and non-metal binding sites are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, but our predictor on those metal binding targets performs better than those non-metal ones, achieving an improvement of  <dig>  by mcc.

prediction results on casp8
we also apply our method to evaluate on the casp <dig> data set by training on the casp <dig> data set. in the same way, we list the prediction performance on different sliding windows for encoding input vectors and obtain the average performance over those sliding windows. results also show that the combination of different sliding windows yields better performance than any individual sliding window in a robust way, for there is no rule to determine the sliding window size in different data sets. in this work the best one is window  <dig> in casp <dig> while window  <dig> and  <dig> in casp <dig> . in table  <dig> the combination technique yields an mcc of  <dig>  while the best sliding window technique achieves an mcc of  <dig> .

the ensemble of all sliding windows is shown at the last column of the table.

the italic numbers denote the best performance among different sliding windows on the measure of mcc, while the italic number in the last column is for the combination of all sliding windows.

similar results of prediction performance on casp <dig> data set can be shown in table  <dig> comparing to that on the casp <dig> data set. the average performance by mcc on those targets bound to metal ligands is better than that bound to non-metal ligands, where the former achieves an average mcc of  <dig>  and the latter achieves an mcc of  <dig>  only. in addition, although targets with metal ligands contain less number of binding sites than those with non-metal ligands, our method can identify them more accurately, except for two targets, t <dig> and t <dig> 

§it stands for the ratio of the number of ligand sites to the total number of residues of the protein chain.

comparison with other binding site prediction methods
previous experiments showed that template-based prediction methods will perform much better than de novo methods in the context  <cit> , but our method provides a comparative prediction on protein ligand binding sites, especially for the casp <dig> data set. figures  <dig> and  <dig> illustrate prediction comparison on casp <dig> and casp <dig> data sets, respectively. although our method performs worse than most of template-based methods on the casp <dig> data set, it performs better than many methods on the casp <dig> data set.

it is difficult to compare our model with other similar methods for there are seldom methods of predicting ligand binding sites by using only sequence information. most of ligand binding site prediction methods applied structural information of homologous proteins for the prediction. in casp <dig>  fn <dig> is a predictor using svm to identify protein binding sites. it basically used sequence profile information, the results from the disorder prediction models as well as secondary structure prediction models as additional features for the ligand-binding prediction models. another work using sequence information was fn <dig>  which combined sequence information and homology-based transfer to identify protein binding sites. our method yields an mcc of  <dig> , which outperforms the two methods. other two sequence-based methods in table  <dig> performed even worse, only achieving an mcc of  <dig>  for fn <dig> and  <dig>  for fn <dig> in casp <dig>  moreover, the random predictor is also implemented here and ran  <dig> times. the average performance is appended at the last row of table  <dig>  results show that our method outperforms the random predictor by  <dig> times of the mcc score and  <dig> times of the f <dig> score.

the third column denotes how many targets in casp <dig> are tested in the evaluation of each method. the details for fn <dig>  fn <dig>  fn <dig>  and fn <dig> can be referred to  <cit> .

case studies
two targets in casp <dig> were free modeling  targets. the first one was t <dig> , which is a putative fad-dependent oxidoreductase with a bound fad molecule. experiments from casp <dig> showed that the target was the most difficult one in the fn prediction in casp <dig>  with a maximum mcc of  <dig>  and an average score of  <dig> . our sequence-based predictor yields an mcc of  <dig> . the prediction of our method on t <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  although the prediction is not good, our method can identify ligand binding sites partially. in addition, some wrongly predicted binding sites are around those true binding sites.

another fm target was t <dig> . it is formed by three chains and binds seven fe ions. each fe ion is complexed by six histidine residues, where each two histidine residues is from one chain. for the same structures of the three chains, only prediction on chain a is illustrated in figure  <dig>  experiments in casp <dig> showed that all predictors in casp <dig> can correctly identified a subset of the seven binding sites. our method can cover all of the true binding sites, and only contain five wrongly predicted binding sites where two ones are close to true binding sites. our method yields an mcc up to  <dig>  for the target, which outperforms most of the methods in casp <dig> 

the last case is for the target t <dig> , which binds gol nonmetal ligand coordinated to the mg metal ion. in target t <dig>  residues his <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig>  ile <dig>  phe <dig>  leu <dig> and trp <dig> are bound to the gol nonmetal ligand, while residues glu <dig>  asp <dig> and glu <dig> are bound to the mg metal ion. our method can identify four binding site residues: his <dig>  glu <dig>  asp <dig>  glu <dig>  some of which  bound to the gol ligand and some  bound to the mg ion. although our predictor performs worse than some structure-based methods in casp <dig>  it can cover half of the true binding sites and yield an mcc of  <dig>  for the target t <dig> 

discussion
experimental results showed that structure-based predictors yielded worse predictions on targets without local homologues  <cit> . target t <dig> is a typical case. it yielded a maximum mcc score of  <dig>  for the best prediction, and an average score of  <dig> . actually since the target has only remote homologues, its sequence profile is much sparser than other targets. the final encoding vectors for expressing the residues of the target cannot reflect the evolutionary context of binding sites. the following table  <dig> shows part of sequence profile for target t <dig>  where most of the elements are zero. therefore, other features such as secondary structure information as well as other physico-chemical characteristics of residues should be addressed and incorporated as input features, and thus might improve the prediction based on sequence features.

the first column is residue number in the target sequence, while columns  <dig> to  <dig> are acid/amide forms in proportion to their blasted database frequencies.

there is no evidence to show that binding sites to metal ions are easier to be identified than that to nonmetal ligands for those structure-based methods  <cit> , although non-metal ligands are larger and more residues will bind non-metal ligands than metal ligands. however, in this work our sequence-based method yields good prediction on targets bound to metal ions, and achieves an mcc of  <dig>  for the casp <dig> data set and  <dig>  for the casp <dig> data set; while predictions on targets bound to non-metal ligands are much worse. it might be that residues bound to metal ligands are more conserved in evolutionary context than that bound to non-metal ligands, and thus the former can be identified more accurate.

moreover, prediction performance may be changed with different sliding window sizes. to reduce the effects, we took eq.  <dig> to address the issue. results on both the casp <dig> and the casp <dig> data sets show the success and are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the combination of sliding windows performs better than all of the individual ones, it achieves an average mcc of  <dig>   for the casp <dig> data set and an average mcc of  <dig>   for the casp <dig> data set. therefore the selection of the sliding window in different situations can be avoided.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper proposes an ensemble of rf classifiers with only sequence information to predict ligand binding sites. in order to balance the ligand site data set, several data sets are constructed and composed of the binding site subset  and one of the non-binding site subsets , each of the negative subsets is independent to the others. then each data set is inputted into a rf classifier. the ensemble of these rf classifiers can yield good prediction on ligand-binding sites. the encoding schema integrating those properties and evolutionary information of amino acids is important to obtain the evolutionary context of ligand binding site residues and thus, the method yields good performance on predicting ligand binding sites. although structure-based methods still outperform sequence-based methods, our method provides a potentially alternative solution to the binding site prediction problem, especially when similar structure information of the query is not available.
