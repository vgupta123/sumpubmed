BACKGROUND
the majority of food and feed products from genetically modified  plants to date are claimed to be compositionally and nutritionally comparable to the parent crops   <cit> . there is, however, a concern that the inserted genes may constitute a risk of introducing new allergens and/or adjuvants into the food and feed chain . food allergy is an important public health problem, with a prevalence of about 8 % in children and 3 % in adults  <cit> . in food allergic individuals, the normal development of oral tolerance has been disturbed, resulting in t helper type  <dig>  immune responses, ige sensitization towards the allergen and a risk of immediate hypersensitivity reactions upon allergen re-exposure  <cit> . adjuvants may contribute to this break of tolerance by a number of mechanisms such as increased cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex  and co-stimulatory and/or adhesions molecules, and modulated release of cytokines  <cit> , although the mechanisms are not clarified in detail. the food allergic response involves several cell types and organ systems and can cause severe and sometimes fatal reactions. the primary treatment of food allergy is avoidance of the offending food items. obviously, the introduction into the food chain of gm plants containing new food allergens or proteins with adjuvant potential is unwanted and an expressed concern  <cit> .

a processed cry1ab-gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis , coding for a bioactive cry1ab insecticidal toxin, has been inserted into the genome of the maize event mon <dig>  in order to make these crops resistant to damage caused by lepidopterans. the bt bacterium produces a cry1ab protoxin that will exert toxicity after activation by enzymatic cleavage in the gut of susceptible lepidopteran species  <cit> . in the mon <dig> plant, however, an already activated version of the toxin is expressed. the european food safety authority  has concluded that cry1ab-containing crops are regarded safe for human and animal consumption  <cit> . however, intranasal  and intraperitoneal  immunisations with the purified cry1ab proteins have been reported to elicit immune responses in mice  <cit>  and we have previously demonstrated capacity of the trypsin activated cry1ab  toxin to elicit specific immunoglobulin  e and igg <dig> antibodies after i.n. exposure  <cit> . furthermore, feeding trials have revealed inflammatory or immune responses related to the ingestion of cry1ab-containing feed in sensitised fish  <cit> , weaning and old mice  <cit> , rats  <cit>  and pigs  <cit> . previous assessments of cry1ab immune effects have mainly focused on its capacity to provoke cellular and/or humoral responses. the structurally similar cry1ac protein has demonstrated adjuvant capacity in several studies . to our knowledge, only three studies have investigated allergic adjuvant effects of cry1ab, reporting no  <cit>  and possible  <cit>  adjuvant capacity after exposure by airways installation, feeding and oral gavage, respectively. so far, no experimental studies have investigated whether cry proteins have adjuvant properties in relation to clinical food allergy responses.

in the present work, we investigated whether repeated exposures to one high dose level of trypcry1ab may promote allergic responses  in an anaphylactic food allergy model in mice. based on the same immunization regime by intragastric  exposure, we have also explored immunogenic and allergenic properties of trypcry1ab by assessments of specific serum antibodies as well as intestinal gene expression.

RESULTS
assessment of adjuvant capacity of trypcry1ab
anaphylactic responses
during the 30 min after i.p. challenge with allergen extract  on day  <dig>  the rectal temperature dropped significantly in mice i.g. immunised with lupex + ct and lupex + ct + trypcry1ab compared to mice immunised with lupex or lupex + trypcry1ab. there was no significant difference in rectal temperature between the lupex + ct and lupex + ct + trypcry1ab immunised mice, or the lupex and lupex + trypcry1ab immunised mice . likewise, according to the anaphylactic score given during the 30 min observation period after the i.p. challenge with lupex, the clinical response was significantly more pronounced in mice gavaged with lupex + ct and lupex + ct + trypcry1ab, compared to mice gavaged with lupex or lupex + trypcry1ab. the mice gavaged with lupex + ct + trypcry1ab did not display a significantly stronger anaphylactic response than mice gavaged with lupex + ct, nor did the lupex + trypcry1ab versus lupex exposed mice . since animals experiencing strong anaphylactic shock  gave limited volume of blood at the terminal bleed, the number of blood samples per groups available for measurements of the anaphylaxis marker mcpt- <dig> were low . the few serum samples in these groups, however, all had high concentrations of mcpt- <dig>  but this increase did not reach statistical significance relative to the two negative control groups due to the low sample numbers. although not statistically significant for any of the endpoints, almost half of the animals in the lupex + trypcry1ab group tended to have a weak anaphylactic score and high mcpt- <dig> concentrations.fig.  <dig> anaphylactic responses in mice. anaphylactic responses in mice after intragastric  gavages with lupex, lupex + cholera toxin , lupex + ct + trypsinised cry1ab , lupex + trypcry1ab, and hbss  on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  followed by an intraperitoneal  challenge with lupex on day  <dig>  rectal temperature  was measured at  <dig>   <dig> and 30 min after challenge, and anaphylactic score  were determined continuously during those 30 min. mouse mast cell protease- <dig>  levels , a marker for intestinal anaphylaxis, was measured in serum collected after challenge . temperatures are presented as group medians over time, while anaphylactic scores and serum mcpt- <dig> concentrations are presented for each individual animal  and as the group median . asterisk  denote groups that are significantly different  from the lupex group. the dotted line denotes the upper detection limit of the mcpt- <dig> assay

the serum levels of both total ige  and lupin-specific igg <dig>  were significantly higher in mice gavaged with lupex + ct and lupex + ct + trypcry1ab than in the control and lupex groups, i.e., irrespective of the presence of trypcry1ab. neither did the antibody levels differ between groups receiving lupex with or without trypcry1ab.fig.  <dig> serum levels of total ige and lupin specific igg <dig>  serum levels of total ige  and lupin specific igg <dig>  in mice after intragastric  gavages with lupex, lupex + cholera toxin , lupex + ct + trypsinised cry1ab , lupex + trypcry1ab, and hbss  on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  levels are determined in blood samples drawn at day  <dig>  results are presented for each individual animal  and as the group median . asterisk  denote groups that are significantly different  from the lupex group

discussion
we investigated the capacity of a 10 μg dose of trypcry1ab protein given repeatedly by peroral gavage to act as an adjuvant and/or to induce immune responses, in a mouse model of food allergy. the mucosal adjuvant ct with or without trypcry1ab was able to condition for allergic sensitisation and thus anaphylactic responses in allergen-challenged mice, while trypcry1ab at the given dose did not affect any of the allergy or anaphylaxis markers included in the adjuvance experiment. furthermore, there was no indication of an immunogenic potential for i.g. administered trypcry1ab in the model and with the dose employed.

we did not observe any adjuvant capacity of the trypcry1ab protein on the clinical anaphylactic endpoints  or on sensitisation , neither when administered with lupex with or without the tolerance-breaking ct. serum mcpt- <dig>  a marker of anaphylaxis in food allergy mouse models  <cit> , was increased in half of the animals exposed to lupex + trypcry1ab compared to the animals exposed to lupex or vehicle . the elevated mcpt- <dig> in these few animals was, however, not accompanied with any changes in temperature loss, antibody or cytokine responses after challenge or ige sensitisation, thus did not seem to be associated with an allergic or anaphylactic reaction. further, no increase in mcpt- <dig> was observed in the groups exposed to trypcry1ab and trypcry1ab + ct , indicating that trypcry1ab itself was not eliciting a mcpt- <dig> response. unfortunately, expression of the mcpt- <dig> gene was not detectable in the intestinal tissue, and cannot contribute to confirm or reject the observation in serum. thus, it seems reasonable not to regard the increase in serum mcpt- <dig> in a few animals as an adverse outcome, although the possibility that trypcry1ab with lupex elicited local effects in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be excluded, also in light of previous reports  <cit> . we therefore conclude that the single dose of trypcry1ab did not act as an adjuvant in the present experiments.

we have recently demonstrated that airway exposure to different versions of the trypcry1ab protein did not promote allergic responses comparable to those observed with the inclusion of an adjuvant  in mice sensitised with the allergen ovalbumin   <cit> . furthermore, a recent study by reiner et al.  <cit>  investigated the initiation and severity of allergic asthma in mice fed a mon <dig> containing diet, and they were not able to detect any differences in eosinophilic airway and lung inflammation, mucus hypersecretion or ova-specific antibody production, compared to mice given a non-gm diet. taken together with the previous study, our present data from a clinical food allergy model further support the notion that trypcry1ab do not promote development of immune responses towards another allergen, i.e., exerts allergic adjuvant effect. these findings are also partly in agreement with a previous investigation of the adjuvant capacity of trypcry1ab in a model studying lung effects in orally sensitized animals  <cit> . as in the present study, the study showed no detectable effects of cry1ab on sensitisation parameters after intragastric exposure. however, while we did not see any effect after i.p. allergen challenge, guimaraes et al. reported that oral cry1ab enhanced local effects in the lungs after airway peanut challenge. observed responses after airway allergen challenge were early production of leukotrienes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid , and late th2- and th17-cytokine production and eosinophil/neutrophil influx. the methodological differences in doses, route of challenge and target organ  do not allow for a direct comparison of results on local effects.

in the present study, the trypcry1ab protein showed no indications of an immunogenic potential, even when administered together with a potent adjuvant, as the levels of cry1ab-specific antibody levels in serum were low  or below the limit of detection  in mice repeatedly gavaged with a single dose of trypcry1ab. in contrast, we previously demonstrated strong cry1ab-specific igg <dig> and ige responses following the i.n. route of exposure to a lower dose of trypcry1ab  <cit> . others have also detected the immunogenic potential of cry1ab proteins. for example, i.n. and i.p. immunisation with the trypcry1ab protein induced production of specific antibody responses in mice in a study by guerrero et al.  <cit> . also, in rats fed transgenic bt rice or feed spiked with the trypcry1ab a significant elevation of specific antibodies was detected  <cit> . notably, in that study, specific antibody responses were induced in all rats, including the control fed rats, suggesting that the airborne particles or dust from the cry1ab feed and/or the cry1ab spiked feed induced immune responses after inhalation. hence, the kroghsbo study cannot conclude on an immunogenic potential after intragastric exposure to cry1ab. adel-patient et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the i.p. route gave a mixed th1/th <dig> antibody response towards the purified cry1ab protoxin, while in contrast, i.g. administration of purified cry1ab protoxin or mon <dig> protein extract did not have any impact on the humoral immune response in mice. thus, although previous investigations suggest that the cry1ab protein may be immunogenic after airway exposures, the present study support the previous observations that cry1ab proteins do not exert these properties after i.g. exposures. because proteins that are able to escape the prototypical degradation in the digestive tract are more likely to reach the intestinal mucosa and to sensitise the mucosal immune system  <cit> , stability to digestion is considered to be one of several tools to assess the allergenic potential of a protein  <cit> . guimaraes et al.  <cit>  used simulated gastric fluid  at different ph values and demonstrated that while cry1ab were highly degraded at ph  <dig> , it contained its immunoreactivity at ph  <dig>  suggesting that the specific gastric conditions may influence the outcome of allergenicity assessments. nevertheless, degradation in the intestinal tract may explain why immunogenicity seldom is reported after feeding or i.g. studies, while other administration routes not involving similarly efficient degradation cause cellular and humoral responses.

induction of allergic immune responses following mucosal immunisation is usually dependent on the co-administration of appropriate adjuvants to achieve the allergy-associated th <dig> response  <cit> . in our food allergy model this is demonstrated by the necessity for the allergen to be co-administered with ct to disrupt the oral tolerance and thus enhance antibody responses  and the anaphylactic reactions  against the lupex allergen. for investigations of adjuvant effects, we chose two approaches. firstly, to test whether the trypcry1ab protein could act as an adjuvant with similar potency as ct, ct was replaced with the trypcry1ab protein. secondly, to test whether trypcry1ab could act as a further adjuvant in susceptible individuals where the oral tolerance already is broken, we also exposed animals to lupex + ct + trypcry1ab. the latter would allow detection of adjuvants in situations where other circumstances  to disrupt the oral tolerance, which as described above may happen in real life. in line with the criteria suggested by prescott and hogan  <cit>  for the assessment of gm foods we also included an experimental group without the ct. overall, neither of the experimental groups exposed to trypcry1ab differed from the respective control group, strengthening our conclusion of no immunogenic or adjuvant properties of the trypcry1ab proteins at the given dose after i.g. exposure.

in the food allergy models by vinje et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit> , ige antibodies against lupin and peanut allergens, respectively, were detected in the serum of female c3h/hej mice, and splenocytes demonstrated a mixed th1/th <dig> cytokine release and proliferative responses after ex vivo stimulation with allergens in the form of extracts or purified proteins. in addition, serum mcpt- <dig> together with high anaphylactic scores indicated the usefulness as a mouse model for clinical food allergy. in agreement, the positive control in the present study, lupex + ct, also showed increased antibody, mcpt- <dig> and anaphylactic responses. on the other hand, the cultured spleen cells stimulated with the antigens  secreted low or undetectable levels of the cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifnγ. in the cell cultures, the antigens were added at much lower dose than in the original protocol by vinje et al.  <cit>   due to practical limitations in the solubility of trypcry1ab proteins, which probably explain why cytokine release were not elevated even in the positive control . spleen cells stimulated with cona , as an “unspecific” t cell stimulating mitogen probably stimulating a much higher proportion of the t cells, secreted il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and ifnγ cytokines, however these levels were not different between any of the treatments. a trend, however not significant, was detected in the positive control  and it may be speculated that the time interval from the latest exposure on day  <dig> until the harvest and stimulation of splenocytes on day  <dig> did not allow for a robust secretion of cytokines.

to further look for local effects of cry1ab in the intestinal mucosa we assessed the expression of genes suggested to be involved in the immune response in the intestinal tissue, as indicated in a study by gu et al.  <cit> . the expression levels were quantified by normalisation against gusb, identified as one of the most stable reference genes in the mouse small intestine, also compared to the commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  proving to be unstable  <cit> . the present data could not confirm the alterations in gene expression reported in gu and coworkers’ study, where feeding of mon <dig> maize seemed to potentiate oxidative cellular stress in the intestine of sensitised fish, as indicated by increases in superoxide dismutase and hsp <dig> mrna expression. we cannot exclude that the different species, exposure regime, timing , or methodological considerations contributed to the observed lack of local gene expression changes in our mouse model.

the present study does not indicate adverse health effects of trypcry1ab in terms of immunogenic, allergenic or adjuvant properties, however, there are several experimental limitations that should be considered. the cry1ab protein is expressed at low levels in plant material , and methods for isolation/extraction of plant cry1ab protein in sufficient amounts for this study was not available. therefore, a recombinant version was produced in the e. coli bacteria and subsequently trypsin digested to “mimic” the activated form expressed in the plants. this introduces, however, a restriction to our conclusions, since trypcry1ab toxin may have a different immunomodulation capacity than the toxin expressed in plant material due to subtle structural differences. moreover, oral gavage was chosen as a model for oral exposure via food, and gives more accurate dose administrations than exposure via food. however, the daily bolus administration differs from the real-life situations where the proteins are consumed in whole foods. furthermore, our results from a repeated oral gavage of one dose level of trypcry1ab cannot directly be used to generalise for other doses . quantitative maize kernel cry1ab-expression data  <cit>  indicates that the applied dose of 10 μg per mouse per gavage equals the amount of cry1ab expressed in 40 g of maize kernels, which represent a relatively extreme intake for these mice that typically consume 4–5 g feed per day. this high dose was chosen for a proof-of-principle approach, and since there were no effects observed at this dose level, no further experiments with lower doses were performed. as always, caution should be taken to directly transfer results from mice models to humans. future research concerning cry1ab hazard characterisation, however, would benefit from use of the plant version of the cry1ab, several doses and/or realistic exposure regimes. epidemiological investigations of gmo-safety in general, and immune system effects in particular, are sparse, and systematic studies are warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
a single test model should not alone be used to prove or disprove the potential of gm proteins to induce adverse immune responses. however, taken together, the present study supports previous findings suggesting no detectable immunogenic, allergenic or adjuvant capacity of the trypcry1ab protein after i.g. exposure, within the limitations of the model, the doses and the protein contexts applied.
