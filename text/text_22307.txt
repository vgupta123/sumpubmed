BACKGROUND
haemophilus influenzae is a fastidious gram-negative bacterium that is an important cause of human infections including otitis media, meningitis, and pneumonia  <cit> . h. influenzae is unable to synthesise protoporphyrin ix , the immediate precursor of heme, since it lacks all enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway for the porphyrin ring  <cit> . however, most h. influenzae strains express a ferrochelatase which mediates insertion of iron into ppix to form heme  <cit> . thus, h. influenzae has an absolute aerobic growth requirement for an exogenous heme source or ppix in the presence of an iron source. since the only known niche for h. influenzae is humans, the organism must adapt its mechanisms of porphyrin and iron acquisition accordingly  <cit> .

heme is generally intracellular, in the form of hemoglobin or heme containing enzymes, and unavailable to invading microorganisms  <cit> . extracellular hemoglobin, derived from lysed erythrocytes, is bound by the serum protein haptoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is rapidly cleared by the reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, bone marrow or spleen  <cit> . free heme, principally derived from the degradation of methemoglobin, is bound by the serum proteins hemopexin and albumin and cleared from the circulation  <cit> .

hemoglobin and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin, heme-hemopexin, and heme-albumin complexes as well as catalase and myoglobin-haptoglobin can all be utilized by h. influenzae as heme sources in vitro  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying the utilization of these protein heme sources have been extensively studied  <cit> .

in addition to its ability to utilize these multiple heme sources, h. influenzae can also grow when supplied with ppix in the presence of an iron source in vitro. iron sources that can be utilized under such circumstances include various iron salts as well as iron bound to the human iron-binding protein transferrin  <cit> . utilization of iron bound to transferrin by h. influenzae is mediated by specific outer membrane binding proteins  <cit> .

in many microbial species utilization of iron is mediated by small secreted iron binding molecules termed siderophores   <cit> . siderophores have high affinity and specificity for ferric iron, which they bind in the extracellular milieu. the siderophore-iron complex then binds to the corresponding membrane protein receptor on the cell surface as the first step in the utilization of the bound iron  <cit> .

it generally has been assumed that h. influenzae neither produces nor utilizes siderophores as a means of iron acquisition. evidence to support this conclusion includes the following: 1) using the universal siderophore assay of schwyn and neilands  <cit> , modified to permit growth of haemophilus species  <cit> , the h. influenzae type b strain eagan did not produce detectable siderophore  <cit> ; 2) strain eagan was unable to utilize the exogenously supplied siderophores enterobactin, aerobactin or deferroxamine as an iron source  <cit> ; 3) utilization of iron bound transferrin by h. influenzae is dependent on direct contact between the bacterial cell and transferrin, indicating that there is no release of a small iron binding molecule by the bacteria  <cit> ; 4) outer membrane proteins from iron-restricted h. influenzae did not react to polyclonal antisera raised against various siderophore receptor proteins from e. coli, whereas similar outer membrane preparations from the closely related h. parainfluenzae did react  <cit> ; 5) dna probes based on the sequence of genes encoding e. coli siderophore receptor proteins did not hybridize to h. influenzae chromosomal dna  <cit> . although these data are essentially limited to examination of type b strains they have been generally interpreted to indicate that the species h. influenzae in general neither produces nor utilizes siderophores.

recently multiple genomic sequences from strains of h. influenzae have become available. one of these genomic sequences contains a gene cluster with significant homology to components of ferric hydroxamate uptake systems present in other bacteria. the objective of this study was to characterize these siderophore uptake gene homologs of h. influenzae with respect to their distribution across the species, their potential role in siderophore utilization and their regulation in response to iron and heme levels.

RESULTS
identification of a putative siderophore utilization gene cluster in h. influenzae
the genome sequence of the nontypeable h. influenzae  isolate r <dig> has recently become available  <cit>  . examination of the available r <dig> sequence revealed the presence of a putative siderophore uptake related gene cluster . this gene cluster consisted of five putative genes all apparently transcribed in the same direction. three of these genes exhibited significant homology to genes encoding ferric hydroxamate uptake proteins of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  <cit>  and of escherichia coli  <cit>  . these three genes, designated fhucdb, encode a probable abc transport system, with fhub encoding the periplasmic binding protein and fhucd encoding the cytoplasmic membrane permease. in pairwise comparisons  the products encoded by fhuc, fhud and fhub of strain r <dig> exhibited respectively 72%, 56% and 66% identity with the corresponding gene products from a. pleuropneumoniae strain  <dig> . corresponding figures for comparisons of the strain r <dig> fhucdb gene products with those of e. coli k <dig> substrain mg <dig> were 55%, 29% and 39% identity respectively. these data indicate that the fhucbd genes of nthi strain r <dig> constitute the abc-transport components of a siderophore transport system.

the protein encoded by the fourth gene  of the r <dig> gene cluster did not exhibit significant homology to the fhua protein of either e. coli or a. pleuropneumoniae . however, blast searches show that the encoded protein has significant homology to tonb-dependent outer membrane proteins of other bacterial species. tonb-dependent proteins are generally associated with the uptake of iron, heme and other small molecules  <cit> .

neisseria sicca, a common nasopharyngeal commensal which rarely causes infectious disease  <cit> , encodes a tonb-dependent receptor family protein that has the highest sequence homology to the protein encoded by r <dig>  from h. influenzae . the next highest homology to r <dig>  of r <dig>  was associated with a ferric siderophore receptor produced by bordetella pertussis, also a frequent colonizer of the human nasopharynx and a commonly occurring pathogen. r <dig>  also exhibits significant amino acid identity to other uncharacterized putative tonb-dependent outer membrane proteins from a number of additional bordetella species , as well as pseudomonas, burkholderia and nitrosomonas and acidovorax species. these homology studies suggest that the proteins comprising the hydroxamate siderophore abc transport system  may be of different origin than the putative siderophore-binding protein gene encoded by r <dig> . the h. influenzae locus r <dig>  may have originated from bacterial species known to colonize the human nasopharynx.

thus, r <dig>  of nthi strain r <dig> encodes a ton-b dependent outer membrane protein of unknown function. however, it is likely, based on its proximity to genes encoding proteins showing significant identity at the amino acid level to known siderophore associated periplasmic transport systems, that r <dig>  encodes a siderophore-binding outer membrane binding protein. however, since the product of r <dig>  exhibits low homology with characterized fhua proteins and since, to date, we have been unable to construct a mutant in r <dig>  for phenotypic analyses we will use the designation r <dig>  in the following discussions of this putative gene and its encoded protein.

the fhu gene cluster of nthi strain r <dig> is similarly arranged to those of a. pleuropneumoniae in that the putative receptor encoding gene  is located downstream of fhucdb, in contrast to the gene arrangement in e. coli where the outer membrane protein-encoding gene  is upstream of the other three genes. the gene arrangement seen in both nthi strain r <dig> and a. pleuropneumoniae, has also been reported for a third representative of the family pasteurellaceae, namely h. parasuis  <cit> .

blast searches demonstrate that the fifth gene of the gene cluster  identified in nthi strain r <dig> exhibits significant homology to an internal fragment of a transposon integrase . bioinformatic analyses indicate that orf <dig> is not transcriptionally linked to the fhu gene cluster, and thus orf <dig> is not a major focus of this study.

although a putative siderophore transport system was identified in nthi strain r <dig>  no genes with significant homology to known siderophore biosynthetic genes were detected in the r <dig> genomic sequence. the expression of receptor proteins that recognize siderophores produced by other microorganisms  is a well established characteristic of many bacterial species. these include members of the pasteurellaceae, as well as most enteric species, bordetella species, pseudomonads and the mycobacteria  <cit> . possession of a system allowing utilization of xenosiderophores may be of benefit to nthi strains in the complex polymicrobial environment of the human nasopharynx that this organism colonizes.

species distribution of the fhu genes
since an apparent siderophore uptake associated locus was detected in the genomic sequence of nthi strain r <dig> further analyses were performed to determine how widely this locus is distributed within the species.

initially blast searches were performed against fourteen nthi genomic sequences  available at the national center for biotechnology information  <cit> , as well as three h. influenzae genomic sequences available at the wellcome trust sanger institute  <cit> . of these seventeen total genomic sequences, five contained a locus homologous to the fhu locus of strain r <dig> . the five strains containing a fhu gene cluster were all nontypeable strains and were isolated from various niches; the six total strains identified as possessing the fhu locus were respectively isolated from: 1) a middle ear effusion from a child with acute otitis media , 2) middle ear effusions from children with chronic otitis media , 3) the nasopharynx of healthy children  and 4) an adult with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . the fhu negative strains also contained examples of strains associated with each of the above listed disease states/niches. in addition the fhu negative strains include a single strain isolated from the external ear canal of a child with otorrhea , a nontypeable strain isolated from the blood of a patient with meninigitis , a tybe b strain isolated from a patient with meningitis  and two isolates of h. influenzae biogroup aegyptius associated with an invasive infection termed brazilian purpuric fever  <cit> . no correlation between disease state/niche and presence of the fhu genes was evident.

as is the case for nthi strain r <dig>  none of the h. influenzae genomic sequences analyzed above contained genes with homology to known siderophore biosynthetic genes.

in addition to the above in silico analyses of sequenced h. influenzae genomes a pcr based survey of selected strains from a laboratory collection of h. influenzae isolates which had been previously characterized by the electrophoretic mobility of  <dig> metabolic enzymes  <cit>  was performed. thirty-nine strains representing  <dig> different electrophoretic types  were used in this study; four of these strains were type b strains and  <dig> were serologically nontypeable. in addition to characterization by et these strains were previously characterized by biotype, and representative strains of each of the five biotypes were analyzed . pcr assays for the presence of each gene in the fhu locus in each strain were repeated at least twice. of the four type b strains tested, none were positive for the presence of any gene in the fhu locus . in considering strains by biotype, all of the tested strains of biotypes i, iv and v were negative for the presence of all genes in the fhu locus . of six strains of biotype ii, one strain  was positive for the presence of fhucdb and r <dig>  but was negative for the presence of orf <dig> . of  <dig> strains of biotype iii, six strains were consistently positive for the presence of all five genes, ten strains were positive for the presence of at least four genes, and one strain  was consistently positive for the presence of three genes. four of the total  <dig> biotype iii strains tested were consistently negative for the presence of all five genes. negative results for one of the genes of the fhu operon in some strains may result from minor dna sequence variations leading to inefficient primer binding and probably do not reflect absence of the gene. for example strain hi <dig> was negative by pcr for the presence of fhub, but in growth curve assays was able to utilize ferrichrome as a heme source indicating that fhub is likely to be present . strains that consistently gave positive results for at least three of the five genes are designated as being positive for the presence of the fhu gene cluster.

combining the in silico analysis of sequenced isolates and the pcr analysis of additional strains these data indicate that the fhu locus is limited in distribution to nontypeable strains of h. influenzae. none of the five type b strains analyzed  contained the locus. among the nthi strains the locus appears to be predominately restricted to those of biotype iii; of the  <dig> strains that were positive for presence of the fhu locus by pcr,  <dig> were of biotype iii and one was of biotype ii. in considering the sequenced isolates that contained the fhu genes strain r <dig> is a biotype iii strain and strain r <dig> is a biotype ii strain .

in contrast to the clear association with biotype iii strains presence of the fhu locus cannot be associated with any particular disease state/niche since strains containing the fhu locus have been isolated from multiple sites .

a potential siderophore utilization locus has been identified in nthi that appears to be limited to strains of biotype ii and biotype iii, and to predominantly occur in biotype iii strains.

growth studies
since some h. influenzae strains possess an apparent siderophore utilization associated gene locus but lack the corresponding siderophore biosynthesis genes, the ability of such strains to utilize an exogenously supplied siderophore was determined. since homologous genes in e. coli and a. pleuropneumoniae are associated with the utilization of ferrichrome  <cit> , growth assays were performed with ferrichrome as the sole iron source.

having established that strain r <dig> can utilize ferric ferrichrome as a sole iron source we set out to determine if the fhu gene cluster was involved in the utilization of this iron source. an insertional mutation within the coding sequence of fhud was successfully constructed as described in the methods section and a mutation derivative of strain r <dig> was designated hi <dig>  figure 2a shows that strain hi <dig> was unable to grow when supplied with ferric ferrichrome as the sole iron source. the same mutation did not significantly impair the utilization of heme alone  or either ferric citrate nor ferrous ammonium sulphate in the presence of ppix , indicating that the defect is specific for the ferrichrome molecule rather than impacting the acquisition of the iron moiety or of ppix.

in addition to strain r <dig> the fhud insertional mutation was introduced into two strains that were positive for the presence of the fhu gene cluster as determined by pcr analyses ; the two additional strains into which the fhud mutation was introduced were hi <dig> and hi <dig> and correctly constructed mutants of each were identified and designated hi <dig> and hi <dig> respectively. both strains hi <dig> and hi <dig> were able to utilize ferric ferrichrome as an iron source while neither of the corresponding fhud insertion mutants, hi <dig> and hi <dig>  were able to do so . similarly to the data reported for nthi r <dig> neither of the mutant strains were impacted in their ability to utilize other heme and iron sources .

these data demonstrate that h. influenzae strains containing the fhu operon are able to utilize at least one exogenously supplied siderophore, ferrichrome, as an iron source. ferrichrome is synthesized by members of the fungal genera aspergillus, ustilago and penicillium, and may not represent a readily available iron source in the human nasopharynx. thus, ferrichrome may not represent the ideal substrate for the fhu locus of h. influenzae which would be utilized relatively inefficiently and this fact may be reflected in the long lag time observed for growth in ferrichrome. however, the fhubcda system may function more efficiently to transport other xenosiderophores produced by other microorganisms and further investigations will aim to address this issue.

iron/heme repression of transcription of the fhu genes
since the genes of the identified fhu gene cluster are involved in acquisition of iron the potential role of iron and heme  in the regulation of transcription of the genes was determined; since fhuc and r <dig>  are respectively the first and last genes in the putative operon transcriptional analysis within the operon was limited to these two genes. at the same time transcript levels of the two following genes were also determined: 1) hxuc, encoding a heme-hemopexin acquisition associated outer membrane protein  <cit>  and 2) adhc, encoding a glutathione-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase  <cit> . these latter two genes were selected since they represent examples of genes the transcription of which are repressible by fehm  and inducible by fehm  in multiple h. influenzae strains  <cit> . two flasks containing fehm-restricted media were inoculated with strain r <dig> and incubated at 37°c with shaking. samples  were taken from both flasks at  <dig> minute intervals over the first  <dig> minutes of incubation for rna isolation and quantitative-pcr  analysis. after this first  <dig> minute interval fehm  was added to one of the two flasks and samples were removed at  <dig> minute intervals from both flasks for rna isolation and q-pcr. figure  <dig> shows the transcript profile for all four target genes over the  <dig> minute total duration of the experiment. for the three genes fhuc, r <dig>  and hxuc transcript levels in both flasks rose steadily over the first  <dig> minutes of the experiment. in the flask to which fehm was added at  <dig> minutes transcript levels of all three genes fell substantially within  <dig> minutes following addition of fehm and continued to fall thereafter, reaching a plateau at between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes following addition of fehm . in contrast in the flask which remained iron restricted for the duration of the experiment transcript levels of fhuc, r <dig>  and hxuc remained elevated through the entire  <dig> minute experiment. transcript levels of adhc did not change in either flask during the first  <dig> minutes of incubation but rose rapidly following the addition of fehm reaching a plateau within  <dig> minutes . these data demonstrate that expression of the fhu operon in strain r <dig> is repressible by high levels of fehm, consistent with a role for this operon in the acquisition of siderophore bound iron. iron and heme acquisition associated proteins of nthi, including hxuc, have also been shown to be transcribed in vivo during clinical disease  <cit> , indicating the importance of iron and heme acquisition in the disease process.

CONCLUSIONS
our data demonstrate that the h. influenzae strains containing the fhu operon are able to utilize at least one exogenously supplied siderophore, ferrichrome, as an iron source. however, these strains lack the genes encoding the biosynthesis of ferrichrome. ferrichrome is a naturally occurring, prototypic compound of the hydroxamate class of siderophores. it remains unclear whether ferrichrome itself, or another biologically produced ferric-hydroxamate, is actually utilized in vivo by fhu-positive strains of h. influenzae.

several additional points relevant to this newly identified siderophore utilization operon of h. influenzae deserve comment. 1) in addition to h. influenzae, other opportunistic pathogens commonly resident in the oropharynx also contain a functional hydroxamate siderophore utilization operon but do not encode genes for the production and export of hydroxamate siderophores. examples of such microorganisms include staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> , neisseria meningitidis  <cit>  and the yeast, candida albicans  <cit> . this observation suggests that the acquisition of a complete uptake system for the utilization of hydroxamate xenosiderphores is adaptive for h. influenzae as it appears to be for other residents of the human oropharynx.

2) the occurrence in the oropharynx of multiple species which are capable of utilizing, but not synthesizing, ferric-hydroxamates as iron sources implies that one or more microbial sources producing this siderophore class are likely to occur in this niche. this observation supports the contention that presence of the fhu locus is potentially advantageous to those nthi strains that possess these genes.

3) bacteria residing in the human oropharynx and possibly other sites, such as the lung, are the most plausible microbial source of ferrichrome-like compounds available to h. influenzae. ferrichrome is known to be produced by certain filamentous fungi but these species do not occur in the human body. approximately  <dig> species of bacteria exist in the oropharynx of normal adult humans and over  <dig> bacterial species are present in dental plaque. the opportunity for the occurrence of hydroxamate siderophores in the oropharynx appears likely in this bacteria-laden, iron-limited environment. while many of the bacterial species colonizing the oropharynx are likely to be unable to synthesize hydroxamate siderophores, multiple species are known to do so, including pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , burkholderia cenocepacia  <cit>  and b. pertussis  <cit> . this observation suggests that ferric hydroxamates are likely to be available to nontypeable h. influenzae resident within the nasopharynx.

lastly, nontypeable strains of h. influenzae are known to be frequent participants in polymicrobial lung colonization and lung infections involving s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and burkholderia species as well as other bacterial species known to produce and/or utilize hydroxamate siderophores  <cit> . such polymicrobial infections occur in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as at sites in immunocompromized patients. as a subject for future studies, we postulate that expression of a functional fhu operon in nontypeable strains of h. influenzae is likely to afford a growth advantage by selectively increasing iron acquisition from ferric-hydroxamates produced by other bacteria in the mixed commensal environments of the healthy nasopharynx and within sites of polymicrobial infection.
