BACKGROUND
lactic acid bacteria  are part of the gut microbiota of mammals and birds with an important role in environmental, food and clinical microbiology. many lab produce ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins which attract considerable interest as natural and nontoxic food preservatives  <cit> , and as therapeutic agents for human and veterinary applications and in the animal production field  <cit> . bacteriocin-producing lab are also attractive vectors for delivery of therapeutic peptides and proteins and as probiotics .

most bacteriocins produced by lab are synthesized as biologically inactive precursors or prepeptides containing an n-terminal extension that is cleaved off during export to generate their biologically active or mature form. they are generally divided into two main classes. class i consists of the lanthionine-containing post-translationally modified bacteriocins or lantibiotics, while class ii consists of the bacteriocins containing non-modified amino acids. the class ii bacteriocins may be further subdivided into the pediocin-like  bacteriocins, the two-peptide  bacteriocins, the cyclic  bacteriocins, and the non-pediocin-like one peptide linear  bacteriocins  <cit> . however, additional subgroups have been suggested for leaderless peptides, circular bacteriocins, linear peptides derived from large proteins, and the glycosylated bacteriocins  <cit> .

environmental sources as well as wild and game animals are a powerful source of bacteriocin-producing lab . griffon vultures  belong to the old world vultures group, a diverse mix of colonial cliff-nesting scavenger birds that play an essential ecological role as garbage collectors and recyclers. their feeding habits are based almost exclusively on carrion, preferentially of mammals. consequently, their gut microbiota may derive from ecological and evolutionary strategies for carrion exploitation  <cit> . symbiotic relationships among animal hosts and bacteria that confer protection against pathogens are widespread in nature and are considered a driving force in evolution  <cit> . therefore, griffon vultures might be considered as potential reservoirs of bacteriocin-producing lab, with potential biotechnological applications. this work constitutes a first approach on the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity and safety aspects of bacteriocinogenic lab isolated from griffon vulture feces.

methods
microbiological analysis, indicator strains and bacteriocinogenic assays
fresh fecal samples from griffon vultures  were collected from the parque natural del alto tajo , and placed into sterile disposable plastic tubes at 4 °c. samples were 10-fold diluted in sterile peptone water  and homogenized in a stomacher. aliquots from decimal dilutions of the homogenates were spread on duplicate plates of  triptycase soya agar  at 37 °c, 48 h for aerobic mesophilic counts,  on de man, rogosa, and sharpe  plates  at 37 °c, 48 h for growth of lab, and  on slanetz and bartley  plates  and kanamycin aesculin azide  plates with the kanamycin selective supplement  at 37 °c, 48 h for growth of the enterococci. the direct antimicrobial activity of randomly selected isolates was screened by the stab-on-agar test   <cit>  against three gram-positive and four gram-negative indicator bacteria. next, cell-free supernatants of isolates producing halos of inhibtion larger than 7 mm or antimicrobial activity against, at least, three gram positive indicator strains were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity by an agar diffusion test , against a larger number of gram-positive indicators. finally, the most active isolates were also evaluated for the antimicrobial activity of their supernatants by a microtiter plate assay   <cit>  against listeria spp. strains. in the mpa test, one bacteriocin unit  is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the bacteriocin causing 50 % growth inhibition . supernatants were subjected to proteolytic treatment with proteinase k , at 10 mg/ml for 37 °c during 2 h, to ascertain the protein nature of their antagonistic activity. after proteinase inactivation by heat treatment , samples were assayed for residual antimicrobial activity by adt, as described above, using pediococcus damnosus cect <dig> as the indicator microorganism. strains with antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and susceptible to proteinase treatment were considered bac+ and selected for further characterization. indicator strains and specific bacterial growth conditions used in this study are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> indicator species and specific bacterial growth conditions used in this study

genus and species identification, and detection of bacteriocin structural genes and potential virulence factors
from the  <dig> lab isolates showing direct antimicrobial activity,  <dig> of them were taxonomically identified by pcr amplification and sequencing of genes encoding 16s rrna  with primers plb16/mlb <dig>  <cit> , and the gene encoding superoxide dismutase  with primers d1/d <dig>  <cit> . genus and species identification was performed by nucleotide blast analysis using the ncbi platform.

the presence of bacteriocin structural genes of previously described bacteriocins, was evaluated in  <dig> lab isolates with the highest antimicrobial activity in their supernatants. a total of  <dig> bacteriocin structural genes were analysed including  the pediocin-like class iia bacteriocins avicin a , bacteriocin  <dig> , bacteriocin mc4- <dig> , enterocin a , enterocin se-k <dig> , enterocin p , hiracin jm <dig> , mundticin l  and pediocin pa- <dig> ;  the  two-peptide class iib bacteriocins enterocin 1071a-1071b  and enterocin xa-xb ;  the circular class iic bacteriocin enterocin as- <dig> ;  the class iid non-pediocin-like one peptide linear bacteriocins including the leaderless bacteriocins enterocin l <dig> , enterocin js  and enterocin q , and other small heat-stable linear bacteriocins such as enterocin b , enterocin  <dig> , enterocin it , enterocin v <dig>  and brevicin 925a ; as well as the large bacteriolysin enterolysin a . the specific oligonucleotide primers, pcr conditions, positive control strains and references concerning each of the bacteriocin structural genes, are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the presence of genes coding potential virulence factors was evaluated in the nine most active bacteriocinogenic e. faecalis isolates, by using primer pairs and pcr conditions designed for detection of genes cylll–cylls , cylm , cylb , cyla , ace , agg , esp , efaafm and efaafs  and gele-spre and spre , as previously described  <cit> .

production of gelatinase, caseinolytic and hemolytic activity, and antibiotic susceptibility testing
for production of gelatinase, single colonies of the most active nine bacteriocinogenic e. faecalis isolates, previously grown on mrs agar , were streaked onto todd-hewitt agar  containing 30 g of gelatin  per liter, grown overnight at 37 °c, and placed at 4 °c for 5 h before examination of zones of turbidity around the colonies. the caseinolytic activity of the isolates was evaluated by streaking the colonies onto tsa agar  containing  <dig>  % bovine skim milk powder  and overnight growth at 37 °c. a clear zone of hydrolysis within 24 h of growth was considered positive. for investigation of their haemolytic activity, the strains streaked on columbia agar supplemented with 5 %  horse blood  were grown at 37 °c for  <dig> to 2 days. haemolysis was evidenced by the formation of clear zones surrounding the colonies on blood agar plates. the antibiotic susceptibility of the  <dig> selected enterococci with the highest antimicrobial activity in their supernatants was determined by overlaying antibiotic-containing disks  on the diagnostic sensitivity test agar , following the clinical and laboratory standards institute  guidelines  <cit> . the antibiotics tested were ampicillin , chloramphenicol , ciprofloxacin , erythromycin , gentamicin , nitrofurantoin , norfloxacin , penicillin g , rifampicin , teicoplanin , tetracycline , and vancomycin . inhibition zone diameters were measured after overnight incubation of the plates at 37 °c. resistance phenotypes were recorded as recommended by the clsi  <cit> . e. faecalis atcc <dig> and staphylococcus aureus atcc <dig>  were used as control strains.

the clonal relationship among the  <dig> e. faecalis and  <dig> e. faecium isolates from griffon vultures feces with the highest antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and from other enterococci from food, environmental and clinical origin was evaluated by eric-pcr, as previously described  <cit> . the resulting patterns were interpreted after constructing dendrograms using the unweighted-pair group method with arithmetic mean  and the similarity on the dice’s coefficient, analyzed with the phoretix v <dig>  software . for mlst analysis, purified genomic dna from selected enterococcal isolates was used for pcr-amplification of internal fragments of seven housekeeping genes, as previously described  <cit> . the resulting pcr products were purified with an exosap-it pcr clean up reagent  and sequenced in a abi prism  <dig> automated sequencer  at the servicio de microbiología, hospital universitario ramón y cajal, and instituto ramón y cajal de investigaciones sanitarias , madrid . clusters of related sequence types  were grouped into clonal complexes  by using eburst .

purification of bacteriocins
the peptides responsible of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium m1m <dig>  e. faecium m3k <dig> and e. faecium t <dig>  were purified to homogeneity by using a multichromatographic procedure, as previously described  <cit> . briefly, 1-l cultures of supernatants from the early stationary phase were subjected to precipitation with ammonium sulphate , desalted by gel filtration  and further subjected to cation-exchange  and hydrophobic-interaction  chromatographies, followed by reverse phase chromatography  in a fast-protein liquid chromatography system . the most active fractions from the last chromatographic step were combined and rechromatographied on the reverse-phase column to obtain the purified bacteriocin. all the chromatographic columns and equipment were from ge healthcare .

mass spectrometry analysis and amino acid sequencing

maldi tof/tof tandem mass spectrometry  was used to determine the partial amino acid sequence of the purified peptide produced by e. faecium m3k <dig>  acquisition of the ms data was performed on an ultraflex maldi-tof/tof  instrument operated in reflection mode with delayed extraction, at the proteomics core facility of the norwegian university of life sciences, Ås . ms/ms spectra of selected peptides were recorded using the lift ion optics of the mass spectrometer. recorded spectra were processed in flexanalysis software  and mass lists submitted to database searches  were performed using an in-house mascot server . manual annotation of ms/ms spectra  was performed in flexanalysis. the sequences generated were searched against ncbi/taxonomy firmicutes using protein blast.

for n-terminal amino acid sequencing, the purified peptide from e. faecium m1m <dig> was subjected to automatic edman degradation and sequence on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes  in a procise  <dig> ht sequencing system  at the centro de investigaciones biológicas .

RESULTS
identification of isolates with antimicrobial activity
in this study,  <dig> randomly selected isolates from griffon vultures feces grown on mrs plates,  <dig> isolates grown in sb plates and  <dig> isolates grown on kaa plates, were evaluated for their direct antimicrobial activity  against  <dig> gram-positive indicators  and  <dig> gram-negative bacteria . from the  <dig> lab evaluated,  <dig> isolates  showed direct antimicrobial activity against, at least, one of the gram-positive bacterial indicators tested. however, no evidence for direct antimicrobial activity was shown against any of the four gram-negative bacteria tested, including the two c. jejuni strains. from this initial screening,  <dig> lab isolates with the largest halos of inhibition were identified by pcr amplification and sequencing of genes encoding 16s rdna and soda. from these results  <dig> e. faecium ,  <dig> e. faecalis   <dig> e. hirae ,  <dig> e. mundtii ,  <dig> lactobacillus brevis  and  <dig> lactobacillus plantarum  strains were identified. the remaining  <dig> isolates were identified as enterococcus spp. .

antibiotic susceptibility of the  <dig> selected bacteriocinogenic enterococci revealed that all of them  were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics. furthermore, 85 % of the isolates were resistant to rifampicin, 77 % to tetracycline, 50 % to erythromycin, 44 % to cyprofloxacin, 29 % to chloramphenicol, 28 % to nitrofurantoin, 29 % to gentamycin and ampicillin, 25 % to penicillin, and 7 % to vancomycin. however, e. faecalis m3m <dig> and e. faecium m3k <dig> were only resistant to rifampicin while e. faecalis m2m <dig> was sensitive to all antibiotics tested. all isolates were sensitive to teicoplanin. the genotypic evaluation of the antibiotic resistance profile of the enterococci evaluated was not pursued in this study.

safety assessment of e. faecium m3k31
the sensitivity of e. faecium m3k <dig> to ampicillin resulted in a minimum inhibitory concentration  ≤ 2 mg/l and, thus, susceptible to ampicillin according to efsa guidelines  <cit> . this isolate also showed the absence of the virulence markers esp, hylefm and is <dig> 

molecular genotyping of selected enterococcal strains by eric-pcr and mlst analysis
the eric-pcr fingerprints of the nine most antagonistic e. faecalis strains isolated from griffon vultures feces and those from other e. faecalis strains from different food, environmental and clinical origin, revealed  <dig> different clusters . the first cluster included all the isolates from griffon vulture feces and other e. faecalis strains, mostly from human clinical origin. the second cluster included only e. faecalis strains from different origins . the eric-pcr dendrogram showing the genetic relatedness between e. faecium isolates from different origins could be also divided into two clusters. one cluster contained  <dig> out of the  <dig> most antagonistic e. faecium isolates from griffon vultures showing 60 % similarity. the second cluster grouped all the e. faecium isolates from different origins including e. faecium m4m <dig>  isolated from griffon vultures. among the griffon vulture isolates only e. faecium bs <dig> and e. faecium cs <dig> showed an almost identical genotype .fig.  <dig> dendrogram of eric-pcr showing the relatedness amongst the e. faecalis  and e. faecium  isolates from griffon vulture feces and enterococcal isolates from other food, environmental and clinical origin. source abbreviations as indicated in table 1




comparison of the resulting allelic profiles of e. faecalis m3m <dig> and m1s <dig> in the e. faecalis mlst database permitted their annotation as sequence types st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively. on the other hand, e. faecium m1m <dig>  e. faecium m3k <dig> and e. faecium pm1- <dig> were annotated as sequence types st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively, in the e. faecium mlst database. comparative eburst analysis of the resulting sequence types  permitted their location into clusters of related sts .

purification of bacteriocins, mass spectrometry analysis and amino acid sequencing
two of the bacteriocinogenic enterococci isolated from griffon vulture feces, e. faecium m1m <dig> and e. faecium m3k <dig> with high antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and encoding several or a single bacteriocin structural gene, respectively, were selected for purification of the bacteriocins being produced. purification of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium m1m <dig>  encoding five bacteriocin structural genes, permitted a 1397-fold increase of its specific activity and a 32 % recovery of the initial antimicrobial activity. maldi-tof ms of the purified peptide showed a major peak of  <dig>  da, suggesting the peptide was purified to homogeneity . furthermore, determination of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide by edman degradation permitted identification of its 15 n-terminal amino acids as endhrmpnelnrpnn, which unambigously correspond to the n-terminal sequence of the enterocin b . however, entb has a calculated theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  da. purification of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium m3k <dig>  encoding the entp gene, permitted an 897-fold increase of its specific activity and a 11 % recovery of the initial antimicrobial activity. maldi-tof ms analysis of the purified peptide showed a major peak of  <dig>  da . furthermore, the de novo amino acid sequencing of the resulting peptide by maldi tof/tof tandem ms permitted identification of the carboxy-terminal  27-residue peptide svdwgkaigiignnaaanlttggkagw and the amino-terminal  14-residue peptide aaanlttggkagwk , identical to the c-terminal amino acid sequence of enterocin hf  , and with a theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  da. primers devised from the nucleotide sequence of enthf from genbank accession number kj <dig> and pcr amplifications and sequencing of the resulting fragments, confirmed that e. faecium m3k <dig> encoded enthf.fig.  <dig> maldi-tof ms analysis of purified bacteriocins from e. faecium m1m <dig>  and e. faecium m3k <dig> . maldi tof/tof tandem ms analysis of the purified bacteriocin from e. faecium m3k <dig> . the carboxy-terminal  shows the 27-residue peptide svdwgkaigiignnaaanlttggkagw  and the amino-terminal  shows the 14-residue peptide aaanlttggkagwk . numbers indicate molecular mass in daltons

discussion
among other features, most bacteria produce compounds that inhibit competing and pathogenic microorganisms, improving host health  <cit> . since griffon vultures feed regularly on carcasses from dead birds and mammals, it may be hypothesized that vultures could benefit themselves hosting bacteriocin-producing lab to combat bacterial pathogens. in this study, 36 % of the evaluated lab isolates showed direct antimicrobial activity. the enterococci comprised the largest lab group with antimicrobial activity  with e. faecium  as the most identified antagonistic species. enterococci with antimicrobial activity have been previously identified from lab isolated from mammals, birds and fish , but not with this elevated percentage of isolation. enterococci are also the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples of euroasian griffon vultures  <cit>  and in turkey and black vultures whereas enterococcal symbionts living in the hoopoe  uropygial gland produce bacteriocins active against gram-positive pathogens  <cit> . thus, lab with antimicrobial activity isolated from griffon vulture feces mainly contains bacteriocinogenic enterococci.

in this work none of the lab isolated from griffon vultures showed antagonistic activity against any of the four gram-negative indicator bacteria evaluated, including two c. jejuni strains. since griffon vultures are not a reservoir for campylobacter spp.  <cit> , perhaps bacteria different than lab may inhibit or control their presence in this reservoir. several nonribosomal lipopeptides produced by bacillus and paenibacillus spp. have shown antagonistic activity against c. jejuni  <cit> . thus, these bacteria would be further evaluated for antimicrobial activity against c. jejuni when identified from animal and food reservoirs  <cit> . when selected lab were evaluated for antimicrobial activity in their supernatants, the e. faecalis isolates  were less active than e. faecium and other lab isolates , which has been observed from enterococci from other sources . but of interest is the high antimicrobial activity of e. faecium m3k <dig> against most bacterial indicators, including l. lactis bb <dig>  and most of the listeria spp. evaluated .

in this study, most selected bacteriocinogenic lab isolates encoded a variable number of bacteriocin structural genes . however, the presence of structural bacteriocin-producing genes, either alone or in combination with others, seems to be common in bacteriocinogenic enterococci from human, animal, clinical, food, agricultural and environmental sources . furthermore, is also difficult to find a correlation between the number of bacteriocin structural genes and the antagonistic activity and antimicrobial spectrum of the isolates. it may be hypothesized that some bacteriocin-producing genes may be silent, that modifications in the promoter region may affect transcription, and that immunity/regulation/transport of the synthesized bacteriocin may also be impaired. the production of bacteriocins is also regulated by environmental factors such as the temperature  <cit> .

the enterococci are lab with a beneficial role in the sensory characteristics of fermented foods and have been successfully used as starter and adjunct cultures, and permitted as probiotics  <cit> . however, the enterococci are also gastrointestinal  tract colonizers responsible of nosocomial and, to a lesser extent, community acquired infections  <cit> . e. faecalis harbours significantly more virulence determinants than e. faecium  <cit>  and, therefore, we screened the bacteriocinogenic e. faecalis isolates for presence of virulence determinants . in this study, only e. faecalis pm2- <dig> amplified all genes for expression of cytolysin. insertion/deletion events leading to truncated or absent cyl genes and possible sequence divergences may explain the difficulties to tackle genes involved in the production of active cytolysins. most e. faecalis isolates encoded ace, gele and spre. protease expression seems to be strain specific and not representative of clinical isolates although regulatory genes must be also active, to permit protease expression  <cit> . none of the e. faecalis evaluated encoded esp and this is considered a positive attribute since esp is supposed to promote primary attachment to surfaces and escape from the immune system.

enterococci are commonly resistant to macrolides, cephalosporins and tetracycline and often exhibit high-level resistance to gentamicin  <cit> . vultures rely greatly on food which usually derives from medicated livestock that could lead vultures to the acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, modification of the normal microbiota and acquisition of pathogenic bacteria. but, in this study several e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates did not show a large antimicrobial resistance. moreover, e. faecium m3k <dig> was susceptible to ampicillin and did not encode the virulence markers esp, hylefm and is <dig> being considered, according to efsa guidelines  <cit> , a safe probiotic for use in animal nutrition.

the virulence of the enterococci also reflects a selection for specific variants or clones with enhanced pathogenic potential  <cit> . the epidemiological typing of e. faecalis and e. faecium has mainly been performed by eric-pcr and mlst analysis. as expected, e. faecalis strains from griffon vulture feces showed a distinct genetic relatedness among them and from other strains from food, clinical and environmental origin when evaluated by eric-pcr . however, the e. faecium strains formed a more conserved, but also distinct group as compared to enterococcal isolates from different origins . these results suggest the reliability of eric-pcr for genotyping enterococci and, very likely, for their specific monitoring.

previous mlst studies have demonstrated the association between specific clonal complexes and human nosocomial infections for e. faecalis  <cit>  and e. faecium  <cit> . indeed, the majority of hospital-derived isolates of e. faecalis cluster in two clonal complexes, cc <dig> and cc <dig>  however, in e. faecium the sequence types st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> which were previously designated clonal complex cc <dig>  constitutes a hospital-associated clade genetically distinct from most commensal isolates  <cit> . in this study, e. faecalis m3m <dig> and e. faecalis m1s <dig> were identified with the sequence types st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively, none of them included into the clonal complexes cc <dig> and cc <dig> represented by sequence types st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively . in this context, e. faecalis m3m <dig> sensitive to most antibiotics, free of most virulence determinants and encoding gele-spre could be considered a potential strain for production of bioactive peptides with antihypertensive and antioxidant activity, during its growth on bovine skim milk  <cit> . the mlst analysis of the e. faecium isolates showed that while e. faecium m1m <dig>  and e. faecium pm1- <dig>  remain close to strains from a hospital-associated clade the strain of e. faecium m3k <dig>  remains distant from those of the clonal complex cc <dig> and, thus, is considered a safe isolate .

for bacteriocinogenic isolates the possibility exists for their antimicrobial activity being mediated by still unknown or not yet described bacteriocins or by regulation of the production of multiple encoded bacteriocins. in this study, maldi-tof ms analysis and n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified supernatant of e. faecium m1m <dig>  encoding several bacteriocin structural genes, permitted the identification of a major peptide fragment  unambigously recognized as the n-terminal sequence of entb  <cit> . the difference between the obtained and the calculated molecular mass of te entb may be adscribed to still unknown modifications. furthermore, the absence of other major peptide fragments in the purified activity of e. faecium m1m <dig>  may imply that:  other encoded bacteriocins are produced in much lower concentrations,  their structural genes remain silent and/or  their production is regulated by still unknown mechanisms.

on the other hand, maldi-tof ms analysis and the de novo amino acid sequencing by maldi tof/tof tandem ms of the major peptide from the purified supernatant of e. faecium m3k <dig> , encoding entp and with antimicrobial activity against l. lactis bb <dig>  a lab species with low or non-inhibitory activity by class iia bacteriocins  <cit> , permitted the identification of a peptide identical to the c-terminal amino acid sequence of the bacteriocin enthf. the difference between the measured and the calculated molecular mass of enthf, suggests the existence of a disulfide bond linking the two known cysteine residues in the molecule. in this context, mature enthf is 91 % identical to mundticin ks/enterocin crl <dig>  <cit>  and 90 % identical to mundticin l  <cit>  and avicin a  <cit> . these bacteriocins display a high antilisterial activity, and enterocin crl <dig> has even been postulated as a promising alternative agent for the in vivo prevention of listeria spp. infections  <cit> . the absence of the bacteriocin entp in the purified peptide fraction from e. faecium m3k <dig>  imply that further studies on the regulation of the expression of bacteriocin structural genes in bacteriocinogenic enterococci would be pursued.

the specific antimicrobial activity of purified enta and enthf against listeria spp. was higher for enthf as compared to enta . thus, although enta is one of the most potent class iia bacteriocins  <cit> , enthf is even more potent than enta against listeria spp. the determination of the three-dimensional  structure of enthf, produced by e. faecium m3k <dig>  suggest that apparently the β-sheet-like n-terminal domain mediates initial binding to the target cell whereas the helix-containing c-terminal half penetrates into the hydrophobic core of target-cell membranes, docks to domains of specific protein receptors and causes dead of sensitive cells  <cit> . modifications in the amino acid composition of the c-terminal end of class iia bacteriocins may alter the manner and/or extent to which bacteriocins interact with putative or cognate receptors and even with cognate immunity proteins in the membrane of target cells  <cit> . this would explain why the antimicrobial spectra of similar class iia bacteriocins and the susceptibility of sensitive cells to a given bacteriocin, varies much more than would be expected from their known amino acid sequences. accordingly, enthf may be considered a bacteriocin of elevated potential biotechnological interest as a natural food preservative and a therapeutic antimicrobial agent for human and veterinary applications. furthermore, because enthf is a primary metabolite of a linear peptidic nature, it may be considered suitable for the development of novel bacteriocin quimeras with increased target specifity and antimicrobial activity by peptide bioengineering.

within lab, enterococci are increasingly used as probiotics. most probiotics enhance intestinal barrier function, display immunomodulatory activity and exert protective effects due to production of antimicrobial compounds including bacteriocins  <cit> . moreover, the elucidation of the draft genome of e. faecium m3k <dig> has confirmed the existence in this strain of the enthf biosynthetic cluster, the enterocin p structural and immunity genes, and a gene encoding the putative antimicrobial peptide srcam  <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, e. faecium m3k <dig> producing enthf and free of defined virulence markers, would be also considered a safe probiotic for further biotechnological applications including animal nutrition.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has determined that enterococci is the largest lab group with bacteriocinogenic activity, isolated from griffon vulture feces. however, the absence of lab with antagonistic activity against gram-negative bacteria suggest that bacteria, other than lab, would be investigated for their activity against this bacterial group. most enterococci encoded multiple bacteriocins although is production seems to be regulated by still unknown and deficiently evaluated mechanisms. moreover, e. faecium m3k <dig> has been identified as producer of enthf, a bacteriocin with remarkable antimicrobial activity against most evaluated listeria spp. and elevated interest as a natural food preservative. e. faecium m3k <dig>  absent of defined virulent markers, would be also considered a safe probiotic for use in animal nutrition.
