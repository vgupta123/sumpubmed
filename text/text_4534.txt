BACKGROUND
the spread of multi-resistant bacterial pathogens poses a serious threat to the global society in light of commonly appearing hospital- and community-acquired drug-resistant infections. it is therefore urgent to search for new potent antimicrobial agents coping with arising pathogen invasion and, at the same time, minimising the probability of resistance induction in bacteria.

antimicrobial peptides  are widely recognized as promising alternatives to the currently used antibiotics and fungicides  <cit> . amps are widespread in living organisms and constitute an important component of innate immunity to microbial infections  <cit> . in mammals, they are produced by granulocytes, macrophages and most epithelial cells  <cit> . amino-acid sequences of the vast majority of amps share cationic and amphipathic properties that allow their insertion into lipid bilayers and can lead to alteration of biological membrane functions  <cit> . initial characterization studies linked these properties to antimicrobial killing activity. however, further data indicated that this is not the only mode of action and that more subtle mechanisms might mediate the interaction with, and effect on target microbes, as well as the specificity and toxicity of peptides.

the proline-rich peptides  are a distinctive group of amps, isolated in different animal sources, which display an unusually high content of proline and arginine residues in their sequences  <cit> . these peptides show a spectrum of activity limited to gram-negative bacteria and appear to have a stereospecific mode of action mediated by the internalization of the peptides into the cytoplasm without extensive membrane damaging effects  <cit> .

bac <dig> is a linear, 60-residue proline-rich peptide of bovine origin corresponding to the c-terminal antimicrobial domain of a specific protein precursor of cathelicidin family  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that bac <dig>  and its c-terminal truncated form bac <dig>  have a potent in vitro activity against many gram-negative bacteria including enterobacteriaceae, particularly salmonella spp., and the genera pseudomonas, acinetobacter, and sinorhizobium  <cit> , while it is inactive against most of the gram-positive bacteria. bac <dig> is also active against multi-resistant clinical isolates  <cit>  and is able to neutralize endotoxin in experimental rat models of gram-negative septic shock  <cit> . in contrast to most amps, this peptide is not toxic to mammalian cells at concentrations well above those effective against microbes  <cit> . in this respect, bac <dig> is internalized into eukaryotic cells through a pinocytic process  <cit> , but enters bacterial cells through a mechanism mediated by the membrane protein sbma/baca  <cit> . these features suggest that bac <dig> and its fragments might be used in vivo without being toxic to the host and be effective also against intracellular pathogens.

despite the high potential of many amps as antimicrobial agents  <cit> , in most cases, their residual toxicity towards host cells and their rapid degradation and/or inhibition by components of biological fluids represent a real obstacle to their development as therapeutic molecules  <cit> .

in this study we investigated the in vitro activity of bac <dig> in a more physiological context, such as in murine serum and plasma, and the in vivo potential in a murine infection model of typhoid fever. results indicate that the peptide remains substantially active at the site of infection and reduces significantly the mortality of infected animals despite its rapid clearance.

RESULTS
antibacterial activity of bac <dig> in serum or plasma
previous results showed that bac <dig> has a potent in vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . before testing whether this peptide can also be active in vivo, we assayed its antibacterial activity in vitro in the presence of body fluid components. when killing kinetics assays were performed in the presence of 66% murine plasma or serum, the activity of bac <dig> towards salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was reduced although still detectable . in particular, after 1h-incubation with serum or plasma, bac <dig>  reduced the number of cfu by  <dig> - <dig> log vs  <dig>  log detected in the absence of these biological fluids. to obtain a comparable reduction of cfu without the presence of plasma/serum,  <dig> μm peptide should be used. at longer incubation times, the activity of the proline-rich peptide seemed further inhibited, especially by murine serum . we also assayed the effects of serum albumin, the most abundant protein in blood, on the peptide activity. in contrast to what observed for other amps  <cit> , the bactericidal activity of bac <dig> did not change upon addition of  <dig> mg/ml bsa, a concentration corresponding to that present in the blood .

stability of bac <dig> in serum and plasma
inhibition of the peptide due to enzymatic degradation by blood proteases was taken into account to explain the reduced activity of bac <dig> in biological fluids. the stability of bac <dig> was therefore evaluated by incubating the peptide up to  <dig> h with murine plasma or serum followed by western blot analysis. immunodetection indicated a slow and progressive reduction of the band corresponding to intact bac <dig>  which disappeared after  <dig> h-incubation in serum . the degradation of bac <dig> in plasma was slower , suggesting that the activation of proteases of the coagulation cascade in serum may contribute to the faster peptide degradation in this medium. lc-ms analysis indicated that the amount of intact bac <dig> in murine serum decreases by 10% after  <dig> h of incubation and that the peptide was almost completely degraded after  <dig> h . the degradation process is slower in plasma than in serum, , confirming the result observed in the western blot analysis, while in pbs alone, no peptide degradation was observed even after several days of incubation at 37°c.

no fragments of bac <dig> were detected by lc-ms analysis. this may due to generation of hydrophilic fragments of a few residues by responsible protease, which are not detectable by either anti-bac <dig> antibodies or lc-ms. enzymes such as trypsin-like serine proteases, which may cleave at the many arg residues present in the sequence of bac <dig>  might have this effect. however, these results clearly indicate that the peptide should be quite stable in blood and its degradation occurs only after several hours, suggesting that the decreased activity of bac <dig> is only in part due to its degradation.

in vivo toxicity
as a first step to evaluate the therapeutic potential of bac <dig>  its in vivo toxicity was determined in balb/c and cba/ca mice after injection via i.p. of increasing single peptide doses. no apparent toxic effect was observed when the peptide was administered i.p. up to  <dig> mg/kg, but the mice receiving the highest peptide dose  died  <dig> days post injection. this result confirms that bac <dig> is much less toxic than other cathelicidin-derived peptides such as those belonging to the α-helical group  <cit>  and, in this respect, it behaves similarly to insect proline-rich amps. for example, pyrrhocoricin protected mice against e. coli infection, and showed no toxicity up to the maximal applied dose i.v. of  <dig> mg/kg. drosocin is completely devoid of toxicity to healthy animals when used via i.v. at  <dig> mg/kg  <cit> . on the contrary, lytic peptides such as bmap- <dig> and - <dig> are toxic via i.p. already at 10- <dig> mg/kg  <cit> .

in vivo bac <dig> activity in a mouse model of typhoid fever
the potential of bac <dig> to protect mice from a bacterial challenge was tested by a mouse model of salmonella infection. infected mice develop a systemic disease characterized by rapid bacterial multiplication in the liver and spleen that resembles typhoid fever caused by salmonella serovar typhi in humans  <cit> . cell-mediated immunity and macrophage activity play a key role in defence against murine salmonellosis, and it has been shown that these immune responses are lacking in balb/c mice  <cit>  so that also the antibiotic ciprofloxacin failed to prevent fatal s. typhimurium disease in this mouse strain  <cit> . for this reason, we preferred to use cba/ca mice that show a lower susceptibility to salmonella infection  <cit>  to study the antimicrobial properties of bac <dig>  nevertheless, an acute infection may be induced by i.p. injection of less than a hundred of cfu/mouse. male cba/ca mice were infected via i.p. with a lethal dose of s. typhimurium atcc  <dig> , followed by i.p. injection of peptide at  <dig> mg/kg. the number of survivors was monitored for  <dig> days and compared to that of control mice that only received the lethal bacterial challenge. the survival curves of untreated and peptide-treated mice are significantly different ; the mean survival time of control mice was  <dig> days, while the treatment of infected mice with bac <dig> increased the mean survival time to  <dig>  days. it is worth noting that 36% of the infected mice treated with bac <dig> were completely cured with respect to 0% survival for untreated animals  .

in parallel to survival experiments, a group of mice was also analyzed for bacterial load at  <dig> days post-inoculation, when the infected animals did not show any visible sign of disease. viable bacterial cells were counted in murine liver and spleen of infected mice and results are reported in figure 3b. the number of viable bacterial cells in liver and spleen homogenates decreased significantly in the animals treated with the peptide at  <dig> mg/kg, despite a remarkable variability in each group. in 1/ <dig> of the animals bacteria were undetectable in both the spleen and liver. this result is in keeping with the percentage of mice cured extrapolated by the survival curve .

given that i.p. injection of as few as  <dig> salmonellae is lethal for mice, the increased survival times and the eradication of the infection in 1/ <dig> of the peptide-treated animals is a promising result. in addition, the protective role showed by bac <dig> suggests that the peptide may exert its bactericidal action also in infected cells, since s. typhimurium is an intracellular pathogen and bac <dig> is able to penetrate host cells  <cit> .

in vivo time-domain optical imaging
following the results with the mouse model of infection, we investigated the in vivo biodistribution of bac <dig> by using a time-domain optical imaging instrument  <cit>  and a derivative of bac <dig>  fluorescently labelled with the dye alexa <dig>  showing an antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the unlabelled peptide .

the bac7-alexa <dig> peptide shows a fast elimination kinetics after i.p. injection, characterized by a specific fluorescence intensity signal in the kidney first and then in the bladder. the compound reaches the kidney and the bladder in respectively  <dig> and  <dig> hours after the injection. the in vivo and ex vivo analyses performed after  <dig> h confirm that the compound has been totally excreted . these results suggest that the labelled compound does not accumulate in any particular organ except those involved in the elimination processes, kidney and bladder, which result completely free of bac7-alexa <dig> one day after injection.

it is well known that mice eliminate drugs thought kidney much more quickly than humans  <cit> . as no nefrotoxic compounds causing renal dysfunction were used to alter pharmacokinetic parameters  <cit> , the very rapid clearance of the peptide may likely have limited its activity against pathogens after injection in the animals. in the light of this observation, the antibiotic activity of bac <dig> may be improved in the future by slowing the kinetics of its renal excretion.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, with this study we have shown that bac <dig> may exert antibacterial activity also in vivo, in a mouse model of infection resembling typhoid fever in humans. this model is particularly challenging in mice due to the extremely low lethal dose of s. typhimurium. intraperitoneal injection of bac <dig> at  <dig> mg/kg increased significantly the survival rate of infected mice and the mean survival times suggesting that it inactivates most of the inoculated bacteria in spite of a partial inhibition due to unknown blood components and a very fast renal excretion rate.

in the light of these observations, the results here reported provide encouraging evidence for a future development of a bac7-based drug in the treatment of gram-negative infections. its in vivo efficacy might be improved by decreasing its clearance rate, for instance by conjugation of the peptide with a drug delivery system. moreover, its effectiveness can also be improved by changing the treatment regimen, for example with repeated dosing. these studies are currently in progress.
