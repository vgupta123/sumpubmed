BACKGROUND
in the past decade, the demand for dna sequence data has driven the transformation of sequencing from a research activity into a manufacturing process. high-throughput sequencing facilities are focused on establishing automated procedures that maintain long read length and high overall success rates. it is neither practical nor economical to test each and every dna template before sequencing  <cit> . sequencing centres, therefore, monitor sequencing success on a larger scale referencing overall pass rates and average read lengths, typically in terms of phred  <dig> bases  <cit> . the percentage of "sporadic sequence dropouts" or failed reads that inevitably occur within a pool of high quality data is often overlooked and rarely examined. failed reads can be a result of numerous variables ranging from pipeline methodology employed to the nature of samples being sequenced. a failure mode analysis  strategy was developed to determine the likely causes of sporadic unsuccessful sequence reads. we systematically examine these failed reads in the context of a high-throughput sequencing pipeline to establish the mode and frequency of each type of failure. the standard production pipeline at canada's michael smith genome sciences centre  has a capacity to generate over  <dig>  million reads per year. as of december  <dig>   <dig>  we have generated  <dig> , <dig>  q <dig> bases using our 384-well culturing, dna preparation, and cycle sequencing procedures. the average q <dig> read length of data generated in the past  <dig> months  from various library types and vector systems is  <dig> bases. the present study was undertaken to provide insight into the causes of sequencing failures and possible corrective actions. although our pipeline uses exclusively abi  <dig> and 3730xl automated sequencers, these results should be applicable, in principle, to the improvement of other high throughput sequencing platforms.

RESULTS
we generated  <dig>  reads from  <dig>  clones selected randomly from two cdna libraries. for each of the two libraries,  <dig>  bacterial colonies containing cdna inserts were picked and arrayed into 384-well microtiter plates . to verify loss of dna due to handling or equipment mishaps , each microtiter plate was cultured in duplicate and replicates were processed using the same instrument model but on different physical units where available. a resulting  <dig>  reads were generated for the 5' end using the m13reverse  primer and  <dig>  reads were generated from the 3' end using the m <dig> forward  primer. the average q <dig> read length for the entire data set was  <dig> bases, average pass rate was 87% which was calculated as a percentage of sequencing reactions yielding a minimum of  <dig> phred  <dig> bases. figure  <dig> illustrates a break down of q <dig> read lengths from the full data set. the analysis methodology employed to determine the failure mode of each trace is outlined in figure  <dig>   <dig>  reads  represent the failed portion of the data set  for further analysis to determine failure mode. the electropherograms from the  <dig>  failed reads were evaluated and subsequently categorized into failure mode categories.  <dig> of these reads were yielded from sequencer capillaries that were clogged and therefore were removed from further analysis and categorized into the "blocked capillary" failure mode. the remaining  <dig>  traces were further classified into nine additional failure mode categories including low signal strength, mixed clone with vector sequence, mixed clone- no vector sequence, low signal to noise ratio, excess dye peaks, hardstop, repetitive sequence, homopolymer stretch, and poly a tail. results and trace characteristics used to classify each read are as described in table  <dig>  eight of the classifications described in table  <dig>  except "low signal strength", are final failure mode categories and contain 74% of the total reads.

* preliminary failure mode, further broken down to final failure modes in table  <dig> 

we identified various failure mode trends by examining process versus template-related failures. figure  <dig> shows  <dig> % of reads with q20< <dig> bp fail as a result of process-related problems while  <dig> % of reads in the q20: 500– <dig> bp bin fail due to template-related characteristics. the proportion of failed reads due to process-related problems are more abundant in traces with lower average read lengths while the opposite trend showing template-related failures increasing with increased average read length is true. a breakdown of failure modes for each  <dig> bp q <dig> bin is shown for process-related failed reads in figure 5a and template-related failures in figure 5b.

the most common mode of failure due to process was "low signal, no dna", there were  <dig> reads in this category, where no template dna was present in the sequencing reactions. this was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis.  <dig> of the reads resulted in read lengths less than  <dig> bp. from these  <dig> reads,  <dig> original clones failed to grow in the source glycerol stock microtiter plates. the remaining  <dig> clones were lost during the dna preparation/purification procedure. mixed clone reads containing vector sequence was the second most prevalent process-related failure mode. the  <dig> reads in this category were distributed broadly across the q20: 100– <dig> bp range. the more successful reads yielded electropherograms with significantly stronger signal strength from one reaction product compared to the other.

the most common failure mode resulting from template-related characteristics was "poly a tail" or failed reads with attenuated sequence due to poly a tails, there were  <dig> reads in this category. the distribution of these  <dig> reads is skewed towards the q20> <dig> bp bins. failures due to "low signal, 5', 3' template characteristics" also contribute to a significant number of template-related failures. these  <dig> reads were q20< <dig> bp and make up the majority failure mode within that q <dig> bin.

our sample set was made up of cdna clones and therefore contain some 3' template biases inherent in the sequencing of cdnas. in a best effort to obtain a distribution representing randomly generated end sequence from various library types, we remove all failed reads resulting from 3' template attributes. the two failure modes targeted for removal are "poly a tail" and the 3' reads within the "low signal, 5', 3' template characteristics" category.  <dig> and  <dig> reads were removed from each respective category representing  <dig> % of all failed reads. the resulting template-related failure mode distribution is represented in figure  <dig>  the process-related distribution of failed reads  remains the same. failed reads due to homopolymer stretches other than those resulting from poly a tails, make up the prominent failure mode within this new template-related failure distribution with  <dig> reads. the distribution of these reads is weighted towards q20> <dig> 

we further analyzed the  <dig> reads  in the preliminary "low signal strength" category in table  <dig> to more finely determine each failure mode . we removed the  <dig> reads and classified them as process-related, "low signal, no dna" failures as described above. for the remaining  <dig> reads, dna was found to be present but there was no evidence from gel images for excess dna. it is therefore unlikely that the low signal failures were due to overloading of capillaries with excess carryover template dna.

the  <dig> reads that appear to have sufficient template dna are grouped by source clone for further analysis. four possible reads may have failed for each unique clone: 5' replicate # <dig> , 3' replicate # <dig> , 5' replicate # <dig> , and 3' replicate # <dig> . there were  <dig> occurrences where two reads failed from one source clone,  <dig> instances where three reads from the same clone failed and  <dig> occurrences where all four reads failed from the same source clone. these results are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig> summarizes the overall breakdown of  <dig> reads in the low signal strength category. a binomial test of our data set indicates that the likelihood of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> reads failing from the same source clone is  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. thus, it is unlikely that more than one read failed per clone by chance.

groupings with two failed reads from the same end of the template, "f1/f2" and "r1/r2" showed trace data with noisy background or no signal trace therefore there was insufficient information to determine actual template characteristic leading to the problematic results. with the low probability of seeing two failed traces from one unique clone, we conclude that these failures are most likely a result of template dna with 5' or 3' ends that are problematic for sequencing. possibilities include secondary structure, mutated priming sites, long poly a tail, or other homopolymer stretches near the priming sites on the template.

the "f1/r1" grouping contained failed reads from both ends of the same replicate but successful end reads from the second replicate. this would indicate that there were no clone related attributes on either end of the template to prevent good sequence thus the failed reads were assessed a process-related failure due to loss of dna during the precipitation process.

the "f1/f2/r1/r2" grouping indicates that no passing sequence data were obtained from 5' or 3' ends of both replicates from the original source clone, all  <dig> reads showed presence of dna at each observational check in the process pipeline. the probability that  <dig> reaction products from a single clone were lost during precipitation is extremely improbable and it is more likely that the original clones had attributes that prevented successful sequencing from either ends. we therefore assign 5' and 3' template-related failure modes for the  <dig> reads in this grouping.

the final groupings of "f1/f2/r1" and "f2/r1/r2" contain  <dig> reads in total. each include failed reads from both ends of one replicate and a single failed read from the second replicate. we maintain the same logic for our failure mode evaluation by assessing both a template-related failure to the  <dig> failed reads from the same replicate and a process-related loss of dna during precipitation failure for the single read from the second replicate.

there were  <dig> reads in the singleton category where only a single read  failed from each clone. these failures cannot be attributed to the template as three other reads were successfully sequenced from the same source clone. failure mode was therefore likely to be process related and due to loss of dna during the precipitation wash steps.

discussion
having established a stringent pass criteria of  <dig> phred  <dig> bases or greater, we observed a broad range of failure modes distributed among the failed reads. reads less than  <dig> bp did not yield useable data and were usually a result of process-related failure modes. process-related mishaps in the pipeline would include missed colony picks, blocked capillaries on sequencers, faulty tips on automated liquid handling devices, or lost dna template during precipitation. the sequences generated have low average read lengths, or in cases where dna is totally lost, zero read length. 88% of reads within the largest "process" related failure mode category, "low signal, no dna", were a result of failed cultures at the beginning of the process pipeline. the absence of dna was verified early on by failed growth in the source microtiter plates and further confirmed by failed growth in the stamped replicate agar plate. failures are perhaps due to missed bacterial colony picks and adjustments such as recalibration or refining the morphology criteria of the colony picker should help. the second most prevalent failure mode in the "process related" category, "mixed clone with vector sequence" , is likely a result of two side by side colonies being picked into the same well or through contamination originating from the use of automated liquid handlers. these problems might be alleviated by increasing the stringency of the proximity criteria on the colony picking device to ensure sufficient distance exists between two bacterial colonies before they are chosen for picking. as we use new tips on the instruments daily, increasing the length or number of wash cycles on the automated liquid handlers between volume transfers may help in reducing carry over contamination from one plate to another. this will need further investigation. cross contamination between adjacent wells can also arise with the mishandling of plates, or when tips are plunged too deeply into the wells, displacing the volume into adjacent wells. adjusting the liquid handler by reducing the depth and speed of tips entering each well may help prevent the occurrences of cross contamination within a plate. despite the presence of mixed clones within one well, traces often yielded discernable sequence with read lengths broadly distributed up to the q20: 500– <dig> bp bin. this is likely the result of a presence in greater amount of one reaction product over the second leading to proportionately stronger signal strength.

template-related failures often still yielded reads of several hundred base pairs. template characteristics that might contribute to failed or truncated reads could be poly a tails, homopolymer stretches, or other highly repetitive regions. problems in sequencing these types of regions are well cited in the literature and are dependent on chemistry and methodology used in sequencing. these problems are best avoided by using an anchored primer for first strand synthesis of cdna as the first step in library construction. "poly a tail" was the single largest cause of failed sequence in both the template-related failure category as well as the entire data set, yet the reads make up the majority in the higher failed read length bins. in our regular production pipeline, we often circumvent this problem by using a combination of a 3' primer to resolve sequence immediately following the poly a coupled with an oligo23n  anchored primer to resolve the 3' ends of cdna inserts.

CONCLUSIONS
the fma pipeline described here was tailored to our high-throughput 384-well automated sequencing pipeline but many of the components in this platform are shared within the high-throughput sequencing community such as the alkaline lysis procedure to prepare and purify dna, dna sequencing using big dye chemistry, ethanol precipitation to clean up reaction products and equipment such as the genetix qpix, beckman coulter biomek fx, and applied biosystems  <dig> xl dna analyzer. for this reason our fma methods can be readily adapted to analyze other similar sequencing platforms. extending our present study to other library types commonly sequenced in the high-throughput community, such as shotgun or serial analysis of gene expression  should offer further information regarding template specific failures. this failure mode analysis provides information on distinguishing between process and template-related attributes that may lead to downstream failed sequence. it can therefore be a useful tool used to audit overall sequencing procedures and identify key problematic steps in a process pipeline. making proper adjustments to the pipeline based on the results will likely result in increased efficiency, enhanced data quality, and decreased cost.
