BACKGROUND
there is growing need for novel technologies to restore, maintain, and enhance organ function. since the 90s, stem cells have emerged as a new venue for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. human embryonic stem  cells, induced pluripotent stem  cells and mesenchymal stem cells , all has emerged as potential source for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications  <cit> . among those, mscs appear to have several advantages including the possibility of using autologous cells and the excellent safety record when transplanted into humans  <cit> . currently, there is urgent need for engineered blood vessels to treat subjects with peripheral and coronary artery disease and for the vascularization of engineered tissues  <cit> . in general, mscs have been isolated and characterized from different sources such as bone marrow  <cit> , adipose tissue  <cit> , umbilical cord blood  <cit> , placenta  <cit> , umbilical cord matrix  <cit> , amniotic membrane  <cit>  and dental pulp  <cit> , and also been found in the stroma of various tissues and organs. previous studies proved mscs endothelial lineage differentiation and vascular potential  <cit> . vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are the two major processes responsible for the development of blood vessels . the formation of endothelial tissue  is a course of action, referred to as the in situ formation of blood vessels from epcs  or angioblasts. these are differentiated from mesodermal cells and are prearranged to form a capillary network structure by growth and fusion of multiple blood islands  <cit> . alternatively, angiogenesis will also result in new blood vessels arbitrated through the sprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels, which happens in situations such as embryonic development  <cit> .

therapeutic angiogenesis is an essential process to maintain the integrity and treat disorders of insufficient perfusion of tissue by modulating the endothelial function or promoting blood vessels growth and proliferation. msc-mediated vascular regeneration has been studied in vitro and in vivo, using angiogenic cytokines and growth factor supplements such as vascular endothelial growth factor , basic fibroblast growth factor  and hepatocyte growth factor  in attempt to enhance vasculogenesis when endogenous neovascularization is inadequate  <cit> .

several preclinical and clinical trials have demonstrated positive outcomes with mscs in limb ischemia, ischemic stroke and peripheral ischemia with systemic sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and acute myocardial infarction  <cit> . in most of these cases, mscs generated vascular network, reduced skin necrosis and restored the blood flow  <cit> . in another study, mscs alone or co-cultured with ec promoted wound healing in diabetic and non diabetic animal models through the differentiation process and secretion of proangiogenic factors  <cit> . hence, these investigations were indicative that, mscs have paracrine effects through the secretion of a number of bioactive factors such as cytokines and growth factors that rejuvenate the injured or diseased tissues. recently, msc like population has been identified in skin dermis with immunoregulatory properties, multipotent differentiation into adipocyte, osteoblast, chondrocyte, neuron, hepatocyte and insulin-producing pancreatic cells   <cit> . these results suggest that, under the defined microenvironment, it is achievable to tailor the differentiation of msc-like stromal cells into numerous types of cells for therapeutic applications. the angiogenic property of skin derived cells has been showed indirectly by previous studies, when co-cultured with ec. ec formed capillary-like tubes in response to paracrine factors secreted by skin cells, especially vegf  <cit> . furthermore, another study showed that the neosynthesis of extracellular matrix by skin cells is an important factor in in vitro angiogenesis  <cit> . herein we report for the first time that sscs have the potential to differentiate into endothelial-like cells and to form capillary network using an in vitro matrigel  angiogenesis assay. using qrt-pcr and immunofluorescent imaging, differentiated cells expressed several markers  supporting their endothelial commitment. our findings have significant implications for the utilization of sscs as a novel source of multipotent cells for tissue engineering and regeneration.

RESULTS
morphology and characterization of cultured cells
the adherent cultured human msc-tert, admscs, adsscs and nfsscs exhibited fibroblast-like, spindle-shaped morphology when observed under light microscope . nonetheless, all groups were positive  for stromal cell-associated markers , and were negative  for endothelial and hematopoietic lineage markers  , indicating great similarities between mscs and sscs. huvec expressed high levels  of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and were dim positive for cd <dig>  and hladr , and were negative for cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> . the endothelial differentiation experiments were conducted on hadmscs, hadsscs and hnfsscs at passage 4; while the immortalized hmsc-tert cells were acquired at passage  <dig> 

adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential
we assessed the differentiation potential of cultured mscs and sscs. when induced in adipogenic medium for  <dig> days, hmsc-tert, hadmsc, hadsscs, and hnfsscs began to accumulate intracellular lipid vacuoles that progressively filled the cytoplasm adjacent to the cell membrane, and were positive for oil red o staining, confirming their adipogenic phenotype . similarly, cells induced under osteogenic conditions exhibited positive alkaline phosphatase  staining, thus confirming their osteogenic differentiation. by contrast, non-induced control cells didn't reveal any positive staining. notably, hadsscs and hnfsscs cells demonstrated less osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential when compared to mscs .

differentiation of mscs and sscs into endothelial cells 
in order to assess the endothelial differentiation potential of hmsc-tert, hadmscs, hadsscs and hnfsscs, cells were induced for  <dig> days as described in materials and methods. as shown in figure  <dig>  cell morphology of induced cultures  did not show significant difference when compared to non-induced  culture conditions, all maintaining fibroblast-like spindle shaped morphology. nonetheless, induced cultures exhibited similar expression pattern of stromal lineage cd markers to those seen under non-induced conditions . the angiogenic capability of induced cells was then assessed using an in vitro endothelial tube formation assay, whereas huvec cells were used as positive control. induced cells were cultured in the presence of endothelial differentiation cocktail for  <dig> days, followed by migration to matrigel-coated plates. twenty four hours later, cells exhibited tube-like interconnected structures, whereas the percentage of capillaries gradually increased until discrete matrigel regions were enclosed by cell islets or tubes , which was similar to capillary structures formed by huvec . in contrast, non-induced cells on matrigel showed scattered populations with very few tube-like clusters, mainly in the hnfsscs and hadsscs . notably, hnfsscs exhibited the highest tube formation capabilities compared to the other cell types when cultured on matrigel . to confirm the endothelial differentiation under our culture conditions, induced cells on matrigel were stained for cd <dig>  ve-cadherin, enos, vegf <dig> and vwf and were visualized under fluorescent microscope. non-induced cells did not express any of these markers, even when cultured on matrigel . on the other hand, cells induced for  <dig> days and cultured on matrigel exhibited significant expression of the aforementioned endothelial markers . concordant with the capillary formation data from figure  <dig>  hnfsscs and hadsscs exhibited the highest expression level of endothelial-associated markers . to further confirm their endothelial differentiation, the expression levels of various endothelial and angiogenesis-associated genes , vascular endothelial cadherin , factor viii  and vascular cell adhesion molecule  <dig> ) was assessed in non-induced, induced, and induced plus matrigel cultured cells using quantitative real-time pcr. the data presented in figure  <dig> demonstrated significant increases in the expression of vegfr <dig>  ve-cadherin, fviii, and vcam <dig> under induction culture conditions, further supporting their endothelial commitment.

correlation between vascular density, cd <dig> expression and endothelial differentiation
interestingly, immunohistological examination   <cit> ) of adipose, adult dermal skin, and neonatal foreskin tissues revealed a higher vascular density in human neonatal foreskin, followed by dermal skin and adipose tissue , which apparently paralleled the endothelial differentiation potential of cells derived from those tissues, suggesting that hnfsscs and hadsscs might be "more committed" toward endothelial differentiation. when we examined cd <dig> expression by facs, surprisingly it was predominantly present on hnfsscs  and hadsscs , which was close to its expression o huvec , while it was expressed at much lower level on hmsc-tert  and hadmscs  . similarly, immunohistochemical staining of cd <dig> revealed the same expression trend when comparing adipose, adult dermal and neonatal foreskin tissues .

discussion
in tissue engineering, development of blood vessel is one of the most attractive areas of research for the treatment of vascular diseases and tissue vascularization  <cit> . due to the differentiation and proliferation capabilities of mscs, this cell population is currently an integral part of regenerative medicine  <cit> . ecs are the main element of a primitive vascular plexus, however, the communication between ecs and other cells such as pericytes is also essential for vasculogenesis. vegf act as a potential regulator of ec-pericyte interaction and vascular progenitor cell differentiation in early embryogenesis. although embryonic stem cells have been successfully differentiated into endothelial cells in vitro  <cit> , the use of es for regenerative medicine is still controversial. on the other hand, adult blood vessel-derived ecs have recently been identified for their capability to form three dimensional vessel-like structures through in vitro ec co-culture system  <cit> . their inadequate in vitro proliferation had limited the wide utilization of ecs in tissue engineering  <cit> . considering procurement risk and their short lifespan, researchers have been searching for alternative sources of multipotent stem cells capable of differentiation into endothelial lineage  <cit> . thereafter, ec-like cells differentiated from ucb , placenta, umbilical cord wharton's jelly and adipose tissue derived mscs have been reported  <cit> . recently, it was shown that skin derived cells have adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential  <cit> . nonetheless, a number of other studies revealed that dermal skin cells are multipotent and are capable of differentiation into neurons, hepatocytes, and insulin-producing pancreatic-like cells  <cit> . consistent with previous studies, herein we demonstrated that both adult and neonatal stromal cells isolated from adult dermal skin and neonatal foreskin have similar phenotype to bm and adipose-derived mscs and could be differentiated into adipogenic and osteogenic lineages under the proper induction conditions  <cit> .

more importantly, our current study demonstrated for the first time that human adult dermal and neonatal foreskin derived cd13+ cd29+ cd44+ cd73+ cd90+ cd105+ stromal cells are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells and forming cd31+ vegf+ ve-cadherin+ enos+ vwf+ capillary tube-like structures.

abdallah et al. previously reported that hmsc-tert cells can undergo endothelial differentiation as evident by the upregulation of vegfa, epas- <dig>  hif-2a , etb , while no change in vegfr gene expression was observed after  <dig> and  <dig> days of induction  <cit> . when cultured on matrigel, induced hmsc-tert stained positive for vwf, which collectively would be consistent with the results obtained in the current study. our histological data revealed that hnfsscs and hadsscs are derived from a vascular rich anatomical regions, compared to hadmscs , suggesting that the differentiation potency might depend on the tissue from which the cells were derived. when compared to hmsc-tert and hadmscs, hnfsscs and hadsscs demonstrated the highest formation of tightly-packed capillary tube-like networks in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. interestingly and in contrast, hnfsscs and hadsscs showed the least osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential compared to hmsc-tert and hadmscs , again suggesting that the majority of skin-derived stromal cells might already be committed toward endothelial differentiation to better serve their anatomical location, especially in the event of wound healing which requires rapid neovascularization. concerning basal msc characterization, all cells isolated from these four sites exhibited typical msc characteristics: a fibroblastoid morphology, expression of a typical set of surface markers , and lack of the expression of endothelial and hematopoietic markers . therefore, it is unlikely that our culture system expanded pre-existing endothelial progenitors as the flow cytometry data clearly demonstrated homogeneous population of fibroblast-like spindle-shaped cells which did not express cd <dig> and cd <dig> endothelial progenitor markers  <cit> . interestingly, our data suggested a possible correlation between cd <dig> expression and endothelial differentiation potential . consistent with this, recent report has found that cd146+ mscs within bone marrow are localized in the perivascular region, while the cd146- cells were more in the bone lining region, again suggesting a possible correlation between cd <dig> expression on hmscs and hsscs and vascular commitment  <cit> . currently, cd <dig> is regarded one of the commonly reported positive surface antigens of mscs, among the several stem cell associated markers  <cit> . on the other hand, cd <dig> is also considered as an endothelial and pericyte marker  <cit> . therefore, our data suggest that stromal cell populations that are highly positive for cd <dig> might be more inclined to generate endothelial cells, however this assumption warrants further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that sscs derived from human adult and neonatal skin, are multipotent that have the potential to differentiate into endothelial-like cells, in addition to their adipocytes and osteoblasts differentiation capabilities. therefore, our data is the first to demonstrate endothelial-differentiation potential of dermal-skin stromal cells, which potentially could have a myriad of implications toward understanding the basic biology of wound healing, in tissue engineering, and in regenerative medicine applications.
