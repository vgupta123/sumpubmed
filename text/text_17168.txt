BACKGROUND
the complete sequencing of the genomes of major crop plants, including soybean, promises to revolutionize the study of these plants, especially for crop improvement. soybean was recommended as the model genome for the phaseoloid legumes  <cit>  because of its economic importance, moderate genome size, existing resources and genomic and genetic tools  <cit> . soybean is also an excellent model for studying the evolutionary dynamics of a paleopolyploid genome  <cit> . a research strategy for advancing soybean genomics and its applications was defined by the community based on the availability of numerous genomic resources for soybean and other legumes  <cit> .

soybean is a paleopolyploid genome consisting of ~ <dig> mbp  <cit> , which is thought to be the product of two to three rounds of genome duplication, polyploidization and diploidization in the last  <dig> my  <cit> . new evidence suggests that the most recent of these large-scale duplications may have occurred a mere  <dig> to  <dig> my ago  <cit> ; thus, some duplicated regions are highly similar at the sequence level, with 86–100% sequence identity  <cit> . some duplicate regions have nearly identical fingerprint patterns that can be distinguished only at the sequence level  <cit> . the duplicated nature of the soybean genome presents a significant challenge for genomic and biological research to identify the key regions important for determining agronomic traits. the soybean community has come together to develop a 'gold standard' physical and genetic map resource to facilitate this research  <cit> . integrated genetic and physical maps are extremely valuable for map-based gene isolation, comparative genome analysis, as sources of sequence-ready clones for genome sequencing projects and as important references for assembling of whole genome shotgun sequences. such a whole genome shotgun approach is currently being employed by the department of energy-joint genome institute to sequence the soybean genome  <cit> .

the soybean composite genetic map is well developed consisting of  <dig> linkage groups with  <dig>  markers, including  <dig>  ssrs,  <dig> rflps,  <dig> rapds,  <dig> classical traits, six aflps, ten isozymes, and  <dig> others  <cit> . another  <dig> sequence-based genetic markers were mapped to the soybean genome map  <cit> . a physical map of the 'forrest' genotype was initially developed from  <dig>  bac and bibac clones representing  <dig>  haploid genomes  <cit> . a physical map of the williams  <dig> genotype is also available  <cit>  and was constructed by fingerprinting  <dig>  bac clones from a bsty i library and  <dig>  clones from a hind iii library  <cit> . the current version of this map consists of  <dig>  bac clones in  <dig> contigs with  <dig>  singletons  <cit> . recent improvements to this map include the addition of  <dig> mapped ssr markers that helped resolve map inconsistencies  <cit> . however, a number of contigs still exist in which anchored genetic markers come from different linkage groups. these inconsistencies are likely the result of the recent soybean genome duplication and represent homoeologous regions of the genome.

screening of a bac library is an indispensable procedure for integration of both physical and genetic maps of a genome and is usually performed with a hybridization-based approach, such as overgo probe hybridization, or a pcr-based approach. overgo probes have gained in popularity as markers for large-scale physical mapping of both plant and animal genomes  <cit> . they are particularly useful for screening large-insert libraries to identify clones containing gene-specific sts  markers that can be used in contig assembly. however, overgo markers suffer from the limitations of hybridization and often cannot determine the locus-specific contig. this is especially problematic in a genome with recent duplications, such as soybean. in contrast, with appropriate primer design, pcr-based markers may be locus-specific, defined by single bands on agarose gels.

theoretical analysis of library screening using a n-dimensional pooling strategy  <cit>  led to a more efficient six-dimensional pooling strategy for pcr screening of bacs from large libraries of sorghum  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . this pooling strategy not only uniquely defines individual clones and efficiently eliminates false positives, but also reduces the tedious task of individual clone verifications, by simultaneously comparing any three different configurations of positive pools after one pcr screening without the need for additional pcr screening, such as the superpool strategies used in human  <cit> , bovine  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , and sunflower  <cit> . in contrast to hybridization-based approaches , pcr-based screening of bac pools also allows for rapid verification of results by sequencing of the resulting pcr product. this provides an accurate estimate of false positives and aids in the identification of paralogous regions that complicate the alignments between fpc contigs and genetic markers, since the size of the pcr products from paralogous regions may be identical.

in silico anchoring is an alternative strategy widely used in anchoring bac clones to a genetic map  <cit> , in the construction of comparative maps  <cit>  and in mapping sts markers onto a sequence-based map  <cit> . the in silico mapping approach was demonstrated to be robust in rice using stringent cutoff parameters  and filtering repetitive sequences  <cit> .

in this study, our goal was to obtain at least  <dig> connections between the soybean genetic and physical maps using a 6-d, pcr based strategy. based on the distribution of the more than  <dig> ssr markers  <cit>  and additional  <dig> gene-based markers on the genetic map  <cit> , we selected  <dig> genetic markers for our study. we also designed primers from suspected homoeologous regions and from bac-end sequences  to explore the utility of the 6-d pools for targeting duplicated contigs and assisting contig merging. we also mined the available bes and database sequences to anchor markers via in silico approaches. these methods resulted in the placement of thousands of molecular markers onto the 'williams'  <dig> bac contig physical map, establishing useful connections to the soybean genetic map. all these resource are available to the soybean scientific community  <cit> .

RESULTS
6-d bac pool generation
a bsty i bac library was constructed for the soybean cultivar williams  <dig> in vector pcugibac <dig> . the library consists of  <dig>  clones stored in  <dig> 384-well microtiter plates. to determine the size distribution of bac clones in the library, the insert size of  <dig> randomly sampled clones was estimated after bsty i digestion. the average insert size is  <dig> kb, with a range of  <dig> to  <dig> kb . more than 80% of the clones are larger than  <dig> kb. given the average insert size and estimated size of the soybean genome, the library represents approximately  <dig>  haploid equivalents. the library can be obtained through the clemson university genomics institute.

the 6d pooling design is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the pooling was performed using a modification of the established method used in sorghum  <cit>  as dictated by the soybean genome size. we selected  <dig> 384-well plates with the best uniform culture growth to generate bac dna pools. a total of  <dig>  bac clones were pooled in six distinct directions to generate  <dig> bac pools. each bac pool consists of  <dig> sub-pools except the side pool  with  <dig> sub-pools. the number of clones per pool is  <dig>  clones or  <dig> clones . as a reflection of the soybean genome size, these numbers are higher than those used for sorghum   <cit>  but lower than those used for maize   <cit> . given the genome coverage, an average of  <dig>  bac clones should be identified for each locus probed. the six dimensional pools should have an expected 36~ <dig> positives for each marker investigated.

anchoring genetic markers using the 6d pools
as a control, we constructed a bac pool consisting of all of the  <dig> pools. this mixture was used to test all primer sets before probing the 6d pools and was also helpful in optimizing pcr conditions to improve detection. in this way, we were assured that positive clones were present in the pools before investing time and money for pool screening. a subset of pools  was then used for pcr pre-screening to select primers which produced a number of positives with a defined range for further screening. the primers with many positives  or no positive in the  <dig> subset pools out of  <dig> pools were eliminated from further screening. in each step of screening, the williams  <dig> genomic dna was used as a control to easily identify which pcr amplicon corresponded to the targeted marker or gene. we observed in several cases that primers would generate multiple bands when using bac dna as the template, but only a single band was observed using genomic dna as the pcr template.

the pcr screening workflow is illustrated in additional file  <dig>  in this study,  <dig> primer sets were tested against a subset of bac pools . we used  <dig> primer pairs having 1~ <dig> positives out of the  <dig> subset pools for full screening of the  <dig> pools. the failure of  <dig> primer sets was due to a variety of reasons; such as, pcr failure , more than  <dig> positives out of the  <dig> subset pools , lack of primer specificity , or representing apparently unclonable regions .

the six-dimensional pools were screened with  <dig>  pcr-based markers, including  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> snp-containing stss and  <dig> sts markers without genetic location information. eventually,  <dig> clear pcr products from the williams  <dig> genomic dna amplified with  <dig> primer sets were de-convoluted. among  <dig> anchored markers,  <dig> primer pairs  amplified a unique band and  <dig> primer pairs  amplified multiple distinct bands . we assumed each band represented one locus. therefore, the  <dig> pcr amplicons represented  <dig> distinct loci. each locus was scored and de-convoluted independently. the  <dig> loci  were anchored onto the bac-based physical map  <cit> , among which,  <dig> loci are genetically mapped and  <dig> loci are unmapped. a proportion of markers  could not be de-convoluted because of either false negatives  or due to apparent amplification of repetitive sequences . the  <dig> loci  mapped to  <dig> physical map contigs. the complete dataset used to perform this analysis is provided in additional file  <dig> 

an example of integration of the genetic and physical map with  <dig> genetic markers for a detailed region of ~ <dig> cm length on linkage group  e is illustrated in figure  <dig>  we combined three sources of data  of williams  <dig> whole-genome shotgun sequences  provided by dr. jeremy schmutz) to analyze the  <dig> cm region to determine the degree of colinearity between the three sources of data in order to ascertain the potential difficulties to be encountered in a genome-wide integration. a total of  <dig> clones hit by  <dig> markers distributed to  <dig> fpc contigs ranging from  <dig> to <dig> clones/contig with two singletons . eight of the  <dig> contigs were targeted by two or more markers. from the alignments between genetic markers and fpc contigs, few discrepancies of marker order between physical and genetic maps are obvious. the position of several markers  on the genetic map may be not accurate because of genotyping errors. we used sequences of the  <dig> markers and bess of the  <dig> clones to blast against the 7× assembly. the wss scaffolds were arranged based on the marker order on the genetic map and aligned to fpc contigs if bess supported the anchoring . the result indicated that discrepancies of marker order indeed exist between the genetic map and 7× assembly. marker anchoring by 6-d pool screening was very accurate except for a few contigs with a single hit. therefore, fpc contigs detected by a single clone tend to be problematic and may be false positives. for the  <dig> fpc contigs, we estimated the average false positive rate for contig assembling of bac clones is 14% .

a detailed analysis of  <dig> clones identified by  <dig> ssr markers was conducted to confirm the accuracy of the data obtained from the bac pool screening. the results revealed an overall false positive rate of  <dig> %. however, more than 90% of the false positive clones came from those where only a single clone was detected in a contig. therefore, to reduce this source of error, we recommend that only overlapping clones detected by a genetic marker or non-overlapped clones detected by multiple genetic markers  should be used as anchoring points for integration of the genetic map and physical map. if we assume the linkage group assignment of the genetic markers used in our study and the assembly of the current fpc contigs all correct, 60% of the contigs with multiple markers would conflict with an anchor marker placed by assignment to a single bac clone. however, if we remove such markers, then these conflicts drop to only 7%. the real level of conflict may be even lower since we did not eliminate contigs for clearly duplicated regions or those that may be incorrectly assembled. thus, given the correct parameters, the 6d pool strategy is a powerful way to improve the alignment of the soybean physical and genetic maps.

in silico anchoring of sequence tagged sites
we used the soybean unigene set  from ncbi  <cit>  as query entries to blast against the non-redundant bac end sequences  of the williams  <dig> bsty i library. using a strict 10- <dig> e-value cutoff and keeping only one hit with the longest alignment within a blasted bes, we found  <dig> unique bes hits for  <dig> unigenes with ≥95% sequence identity over regions ≥ <dig> bp in length of the aligned sequences. the hits had an average of  <dig> % sequence identity and  <dig> bp sequence alignment length to the query unigenes. out of the  <dig> unigenes,  <dig>  had only one hit and  <dig>  had an average of  <dig>  hits . out of the  <dig> unigenes that had multiple hits,  <dig>  were located in different contigs . those unigenes located on few contigs likely represent duplicated regions. those unigenes hitting several contigs were found to be mostly retroelement-like sequences . a brief summary of the categorized search results is shown in table  <dig>  the complete blast list is available in the additional file  <dig>  the exact number of new gene-based markers that were unambiguously placed onto the williams  <dig> physical map using the in silico approach was  <dig> . another  <dig> unigenes were located on singleton bacs  or bac clones  without fingerprint data. most of unigenes located on singleton bacs could be mapped with the aid of manual editing or genetic markers in the same clone.

the in silico mapping data showed that the  <dig> unigenes were not evenly distributed throughout the  <dig> contigs of the most current version of the williams  <dig> physical map . of these contigs,  <dig>  have only one unigene,  <dig>  contigs have 2~ <dig> unigenes, and  <dig>  contigs have 9~ <dig> unigenes. in addition, among the  <dig> contigs anchored by in silico mapping of unigenes,  <dig> contigs were exclusively anchored by in silico mapping not by 6-d pool screening. the relative low number of genes used in our analysis prevents firm conclusions. however, it is tempting to speculate that the contigs with multiple unigenes represent gene-rich regions of the genome. however, our data would also suggest that some contigs with higher number of unigenes  may be misassembled since the 6-d pooling data revealed marker inconsistencies between the genetic and physical map locations in these contigs. table  <dig> shows the difference in the number of bacs anchored for  <dig> markers for which we obtained results by both pcr  and in silico  approaches. the lower number of bac hits using the in silico approach simply reflects the relatively low amount of sequence information available. these results are very similar to the data obtained from analysis of the grapevine physical map  <cit> .

mapping of paralogous sequences
primers to amplify paralogs in the soybean genome were identified during the discovery of snps via re-sequencing pcr amplicons across six diverse soybean genotypes  <cit> . primers were designed from the sequence trace files of pcr products showing 1–5% nucleotide polymorphisms across the  <dig> genotypes . a total of  <dig> sts markers were used to demonstrate the utility of the 6d pool screening method to map paralogous regions. the results of these pcr screens are shown in the physical map  <cit> . four of the markers detected only one bac clone. however,  <dig>  of the markers screened identified multiple clones, with  <dig>  markers anchored to different contigs. the proportion of bacs anchored to different contigs for these sts markers is much higher than genetically-mapped markers.

shotgun sequencing of four pairs of bacs anchored by four different sts markers was done to further evaluate the quality of the data. the two randomly-selected clones for each marker were located in different contigs. each clone was purified before dna isolation for pcr confirmation. sequencing of bac gm_wbb0080m <dig> yielded only  <dig> kb of sequence. however, all of the other bacs gave an average of  <dig> kb of sequence, representing > <dig> mb of combined sequence. a brief summary of the shotgun sequencing results is shown in table  <dig>  in the alignment fragments, each bac pair anchored by one marker exhibited a very high level of sequence identity, from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. this was especially true for bacs gm_wbb0033d <dig> and gm_wbb0027h <dig>  anchored by marker  <dig> , which shared 100% identical sequence throughout virtually their entire length. as an example, the alignments of homoeologous sequences between bacs gm_wbb0130b <dig> and gm_wbb0060p <dig> were illustrated in figure 5b. we confirmed that the genomic regions corresponding to the two bacs gm_wbb0130b <dig> and gm_wbb0060p <dig> are duplicated on separate chromosomes using fluorescence in situ hybridization  to soybean mitotic chromosomes .

merging small contigs into a big contig
collectively, the soymap project  <cit>  has placed > <dig>  markers onto the williams  <dig> physical map via either 6-d pool pcr screening or overgo hybridization. however, approximately  <dig> floating contigs  still exist. a total of  <dig> pairs of primers were designed from these contigs after eliminating repetitive sequences. after primer testing,  <dig> primer pairs were used for 6-d pool screening in an attempt to merge these floating contigs with larger contigs on the physical map. this same strategy can be used as an efficient way to walk out on contigs spanning large genomic regions of interest. of those primers tested,  <dig>  were anchored to a clone in the same contig containing the bes used for primer design, while  <dig> markers were mapped to different contigs . these results indicate that ~58% of the floating contigs could not be placed onto additional bacs in the bsty i library pools. the other floating contigs were either extended or merged to larger contigs via the 6-d pool pcr screening.

discussion
a 'gold standard' soybean physical map is the stated goal of the soybean community  <cit>  and will be an important resource for the assembly of the whole genome shotgun sequence being generated by the doe-jgi project. it will be particularly useful to aid assembly of repeat-rich regions such as telomeres, centromeres and duplicated regions that are highly similar at the sequence  <cit> . the sequence assembly, in turn, can be used to evaluate the accuracy of fingerprint map merges and to identify contig overlaps not recognized by fingerprint comparisons  <cit> . the degree to which the fingerprint map can be used to guide the assembly of shotgun sequences largely depends on the contiguity and quality of the map. the procedure for fingerprint map construction begins with fingerprint generation, followed by automated fingerprint assembly and manual editing, assisted by contig orientation and merging based on the information of genetic markers anchored on bac contigs. manual editing can improve the contiguity by more than an order of magnitude, but the manual editing phase of map construction is time-consuming and requires dedicated and highly trained staff  <cit> . the integration of physical and genetic maps for a 8-cm region on lg e, assisted with the 7× assembly of whole genome shot gun sequence, demonstrated that the integrated physical map would be more reliable if caution is taken in data clean-up for marker order, questionable clones on a fpc contig or potential errors on the wss assembly, and a high density genetic map would be helpful for integration of maps.

although bac fingerprints are the fundamental data for bac ordering and contig assembly, the fingerprints have several limitations. for example, it is difficult to assemble large contigs even with several libraries and 15× or more coverage without including bridging clones with minimal overlap  <cit> . in addition, when analyzing the data at successively higher cut-off values such as >e- <dig> to examine possible contig mergers, it is difficult to determine contig merges without additional information . the current soybean physical map represents merges done at e-26; a value chosen since lower stringency merges generated too many q  clones  <cit> . the contig merging errors at a higher cut-off may be caused by genome complexity instead of the repetitive elements  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed the utility of the 6d pool, pcr approach for efficiently mapping markers to soybean physical map contigs. specifically, we evaluated  <dig> bes-based markers for extending and merging floating contigs. our results showed that 42% of the floating contigs could be merged via overlapping clones identified by the 6-d pool screening. in theory, given additional libraries, this could be an efficient approach for anchoring all of the floating contigs. collectively, the data show that the 6d pooling strategy provides a powerful approach for improving the soybean physical map by identifying overlapping bac clones, establishing the relationship between bac contigs and genetic markers, and merging and extending contigs by placement of bac singletons. this strategy can also be used efficiently for assembly of locus-specific contigs of long-range, highly duplicated regions  and targeting all members of a specific gene family, such as mips  <cit>  and lysm  <cit> . this approach has a  <dig> % success rate in soybean for anchoring genes to bac clones, which is much higher than  <dig> ×  <dig> overgo pooled hybridization with ~50% success rate . the use of this bac pooling strategy for integrated map construction was successfully demonstrated in sorghum  <cit>  and in maize with a much larger genome  <cit> .

the duplicated nature of the soybean genome complicates the integration of the physical and genetic maps. we found that positive clones of a locus-specific marker often mapped to two or more physical map contigs. in addition, it was common to find markers from different regions of the linkage map that mapped to the same contigs, a situation that was previously noted in the assembly of the genotype 'forrest' physical map  <cit> . most of the ssrs and snp-containing sts may be locus-specific, as defined by single bands on agarose gels, when genomic dna is amplified. however, single bands were not always found when the bac pool dna was used as the pcr template. the pooled bac dna was amplified more efficiently due to its lower complexity allowing the detection of paralogous regions. in order to avoid non-specific amplification, the pcr annealing temperature was  <dig> or 55°c, 5~8°c higher than 47°c that is recommended for most ssr markers  <cit> .

the 6-d pools provide an efficient and cost-effective way to anchor markers onto fpc contigs. one person can screen six markers per day against the  <dig> pools  at a cost of about $ <dig> per marker including labor. the method also has the advantage of avoiding radioactive labeling used in hybridization approaches. pcr-based screening of the dna pools provides anchoring points quickly and unambiguously compared to the traditional hybridization methods since pcr amplicons with different size can be easily distinguished and simultaneously de-convoluted. the pcr products can also be easily isolated and sequenced to provide further confirmation. these features reduce false positives caused by homoeologous sequences from duplicate regions or from the e. coli genomic dna. therefore, the bac pools represent a robust, economical method to map genes or new sequences to the integrated map. however, compared to overgo hybridization with pooled probes, the 6-d pool method is not superior in throughput and coverage of bac clones.

the bac clones within the 6d pools represent about  <dig>  genome equivalents and, therefore, it was expected that approximately 6~ <dig> positive bac clones would be identified per marker. however, the average number of bac clones per marker was  <dig> , which was lower than expected. several reasons were thought to cause this  <cit> : 1) failure to amplify the amplicons in one or more dimensions of the  <dig> pools since deconvolution requires amplification in all six dimensions, 2) failure to identify all clones of highly represented sequences due to occlusion, 3) no representation of the region the marker was designed from in the bsty i bac library, 4) absence of the locus within the subset of the bac library used to construct the bac pools, or 5) over estimation of the average insert size of bac clones.

we found that marker order between the genetic and physical maps was not always consistent . several reasons may explain this; such as, some genetic markers may not be accurately mapped due to the small size of mapping populations used  <cit> , genotyping errors, or skewing of marker segregation; the clones containing the genetic markers may be misplaced on the fpc contig based physical map; or genome duplication may exist within a linkage group . to clarify these issues, bes-based markers should be used to screen all overlapped bac clones containing a given locus. if the target clone is placed correctly, nearby loci tend to be present in many of the same overlapped clones .

the in silico anchoring approach was used to place markers onto fpc contigs. we screened the entire set of unigenes  against the bes from the bsty i library. the  <dig>  bac-end sequences added up to a total of about  <dig>  mb of sequence, which roughly corresponds to  <dig>  genome equivalents. in silico mapping provides a quick means to estimate gene-rich contigs and also to position the gene onto a bac, which provides a physical map location and, by association, a genetic map location.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that the six-dimensional soybean bac pools can be efficiently used to anchor markers to soybean bacs despite the complexity of the soybean genome. in addition to anchoring genetic markers onto the physical map, the pools can be used to target duplicated regions that could confound the contig assembly, merge small contigs and rapidly map members of a gene family. in addition, the in silico mapping approach was also useful to quickly obtain additional marker:bac associations in soybean that could benefit physical and genetic map integration and target genes of interest.
