BACKGROUND
copper  is an essential micronutrient for living organisms. cu, as a cofactor in proteins, is involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. cu has an impact on the development of the nervous system in animals and humans; deficiency of this micronutrient causes menkes syndrome in humans  <cit> . in plants, cu is associated with various physiological activities, such as photosynthesis, mitochondrial respiration, superoxide scavenging, cell wall metabolism, and ethylene sensing  <cit> . cu deficiency causes diverse abnormal phenotypes in plants, including decreased growth and reproductive development, distortion of young leaves, and insufficient water transport  <cit> . cu can also be a toxic element when present in excess by generating hydroxyl radicals that damage cells at the level of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids or by reacting with thiols to displace other essential metals in proteins  <cit> . wilson disease in humans is caused by the accumulation of cu in the liver and brain  <cit> . the most common symptom of cu toxicity in plants is chlorosis of vegetative tissues due to the dysfunction of photosynthesis  <cit> .

to deal with this dual nature of cu, plants, as well as other organisms, have developed a sophisticated homeostatic network to control cu uptake, trafficking, utilization, and detoxification or exportation  <cit> . a main step in the control of cu homeostasis is its uptake through the cell membrane. different types of transporter proteins that can mediate cu uptake have been reported. the major group is the copt /ctr  proteins, which belong to multiple protein families in different organisms  <cit> . the p-type adenosine triphosphate pump is another type of transporter for moving cu from cytosol into organelles in humans and plants  <cit> . it has also been reported that other metal transporters can transport cu into cells. for example, ysl <dig> and ysl <dig> of the opt/ysl iron  transporter family can transport cu from leaves to seeds in arabidopsis  <cit> , and zip <dig> and zip <dig> of the zip zinc  transporter family seem to transport cu in arabidopsis  <cit> .

the cu-uptake function of copt/ctr proteins was described primarily in baker's yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . soon afterward, copt/ctr proteins involved in cu transport were characterized in different organisms, for example: scctr <dig>  scctr <dig>  and scctr <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit> ; atcopt <dig>  atcopt <dig>  atcopt <dig>  atcopt <dig>  and atcopt <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> ; hctr <dig> and hctr <dig> in humans   <cit> ; spctr <dig>  spctr <dig>  and spctr <dig> in fission yeast   <cit> ; mctr <dig> in mouse   <cit> ; psctr <dig> in lizard   <cit> ; ctr1a, ctr1b, and ctr1c in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> ; drctr <dig> in bony fish   <cit> ; cactr <dig> in ascomycete colletotrichum albicans  <cit> ; cgctr <dig> in ascomycete c. gloeosporioides  <cit> ; crctr <dig>  crctr <dig>  crctr <dig>  and crcopt <dig> in green algae   <cit> ; and oscopt <dig> and oscopt <dig> in rice   <cit> . copt/ctr-like proteins also occur in zebrafish  <cit> , ascomycete neurospora crassa  <cit> , and mushroom coprinopsis cinerea  <cit> , although their functions in cu uptake remain to be determined.

the alignment of copt/ctr family members from different species highlights domains that are structurally conserved and probably functionally important during the evolution of these proteins. according to bioinformatic analyses, all copt/ctr proteins contain three putative transmembrane regions  <cit> . characterized copt/ctr proteins are either plasma membrane proteins that transport cu from extracellular spaces into cytosol or vacuoles or lysosome membrane proteins that deliver cu from vacuoles or lysosomes to the cytosol  <cit> . copt/ctr proteins can form a homodimer, homotriplex  <cit> , or heterocomplex with themselves or each other  <cit>  or form a heterocomplex with another protein that is associated with cu transport  <cit> . a structural model has been proposed for the function of human homotrimeric hctr <dig> in which cu first coordinates to the methionine-rich motif in the hctr <dig> extracellular amino -terminus and then a conserved methionine residue upstream of the first transmembrane domain is essential for cu transport  <cit> . the homotriplex is thought to provide a channel for passage of cu across the lipid bilayer  <cit> . the conserved paired cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic carboxyl -terminus of yeast scctr <dig> serve as intracellular donors for cu for its mobilization to the cu chaperones  <cit> .

studies have revealed that the expression of copt/ctr genes is controlled by environmental cu level in different species  <cit> . in general, they are transcriptionally up-regulated in response to cu deprivation and down-regulated in response to cu overdose. the functions of copt/ctr proteins are also influenced by other factors. for example, the human hctr1-mediated cu transport is stimulated by extracellular acidic ph and high k+ concentration  <cit> .

the copt family of rice  consists of seven members, copt <dig> to copt <dig>  copt <dig> and copt <dig> can form homodimers or a heterodimer. the two copts, but not other rice copts, bind to different sites of rice xa <dig> protein, which is a susceptible protein to pathogenic bacterium xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae   <cit> . expression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or xa <dig> alone or coexpression of any two of the three proteins could not complement the phenotype of yeast s. cerevisiae mutant, which lacked the functions of scctr <dig> and scctr <dig> for cu uptake; only coexpression of all three proteins complemented the mutant phenotype  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> are also involved in cu transport. in this study, we analyzed the putative cu-uptake functions of the five rice copts using a yeast ctr mutant. we also analyzed the spatiotemporal, tissue-specific, metal-responsive, and pathogen-responsive expression patterns of rice copts. the results suggest that rice copts are transcriptionally influenced by multiple factors. except for copt <dig> and copt <dig>  other copts may function alone or cooperatively to mediate cu transport in different rice tissues.

methods
plant treatment
to study the effect of cu on gene expression, four-leaf seedlings of rice variety zhonghua  <dig>  were grown in hydroponic culture containing standard physiological cu , manganese , fe , and zn  or overdose cu  as described previously  <cit> . to induce a deficiency of cu, mn, fe, or zn, plants were grown in the culture media lacking cu, mn, fe, or zn for  <dig> weeks.

to analyze the effect of bacterial infection on gene expression, plants were inoculated with philippine xoo strain pxo <dig>  or pxo <dig>  at the booting  stage by the leaf-clipping method  <cit> . the 2-cm leaf fragments next to bacterial infection sites were used for rna isolation.

gene expression analysis
gene expression was analyzed as described previously  <cit> . in brief, total rna was isolated from different tissues of rice variety zhonghua  <dig> using trizol  according to the manufacturer's instruction. the concentration of rna was measured with a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophtometer ; the a260/a <dig> ratio was generally between  <dig>  and  <dig> ; rna concentration was approximately  <dig> μg/ <dig> mg fresh rice tissue. an aliquot  of rna was treated with  <dig> unit of dnase i  in a 20-μl volume for  <dig> minutes to remove contaminating dna and then used for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  analysis. the rt step was performed in a 20-μl volume containing  <dig> μg of rna,  <dig> ng oligo <dig> primer,  <dig> nmol dntp mix, and  <dig> unit of m-mlv reverse transcriptase  according to the manufacturer's instruction. the cdna was stored at -20°c. the qpcr was performed using the sybr premix ex taq kit  on the abi  <dig> real-time pcr system . gene-specific pcr primers are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the expression level of actin gene was first used to standardize the rna sample for each qrt-pcr. the expression level relative to control was then presented. each qrt-pcr or rt-pcr assay was repeated at least twice with similar results, with each repeat having three replicates.

plasmid constructs
the full-length cdnas of rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> genes were obtained by rt-pcr using gene-specific primers . the cdnas of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> were subcloned into the bamhi/ecori sites of p413gpd vector and the cdnas of copt <dig> and copt <dig> were subcloned into the spei/ecori sites of p413gpd separately  <cit> . the cdna of s. cerevisiae ctr <dig> was amplified from yeast by <dig> using gene-specific primers  and was inserted into the spei/ecorv sites of p413gpd. all the cdna sequences were confirmed by dna sequencing. the p413gpd plasmids carrying respective copt <dig> and copt <dig> were as reported previously  <cit> .

functional complementation analyses in yeast
to study the putative function of genes in cu transport, plasmid dna was transformed into the yeast ctr1Δctr3Δ double-mutant strain mpy <dig> , which lacked the ctr <dig> and ctr <dig> for high-affinity cu uptake, by the lithium acetate procedure  <cit> . this mutant strain cannot grow on ethanol/glycerol medium  because it possesses a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain due to the inability of cytochrome c oxidase to obtain its cu factor  <cit> . the transformed yeast cells were grown in sc-his to od600nm =  <dig> . several 10-fold diluted clones were plated as drops on selective media without or with supplement of cu . plates were incubated for  <dig> to  <dig> days at 30°c.

to study the putative functions of genes in fe or zn transport, plasmid dna was transformed into the yeast fet3fet4dey <dig> or zrt1zrt2zhy <dig> mutants or the wild-type strain dey <dig> by the same lithium acetate procedure described above. the fet3fet4dey <dig> double mutant  lacked the fet <dig> and fet <dig> for fe uptake  <cit> . the zrt1zrt2zhy <dig> double mutant  lacked the zrt <dig> and zrt <dig> for zn uptake  <cit> . yeast cells were grown in ypd  medium  to od600nm =  <dig> . several 10-fold diluted clones were plated as drops on selective media containing  <dig> mm bathophenanthroinedisulfonic acid disodium  without or with supplement of fe , or containing  <dig> mm edta without or with supplement of zn . bpds was a synthetic chelate of fe and edta was a synthetic chelate of zn. plates were incubated for  <dig> to  <dig> days at 30°c. the yeast strains transformed with empty vector were the negative controls.

protein-protein interaction in yeast cells
the split-ubiquitin system was used to investigate the interaction of rice copts. the yeast two-hybrid  membrane protein system kit  was used for this type of assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. in this system, copt proteins fused with both the c-terminal half of the ubiquitin protein  and the mutated n-terminal half of the ubiquitin protein . cub could not interact with nubg. when copt proteins interacted, cub and nubg were forced into close proximity, resulting in the activation of reporter gene. each copt full-length cdna amplified from rice variety zhonghua  <dig> using gene-specific primers  was cloned into both vector pbt3-suc and vector ppr3-suc; the 3' ends of copt cdnas were fused with the 5' end of the sequence encoding nubg. the insertion fragments of all the vectors were examined by dna sequencing. cub and nubg fusion constructs were co-transformed into host yeast strain nmy <dig>  interaction was determined by the growth of yeast transformants on medium lacking his or ade and also by measuring β-galactosidase activity.

protein topology analyses
the localization of rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> protein in s. cerevislae was analyzed by fusion of the copt gene with the green fluorescence protein  gene using gene-specific primers . plasmid harboring the fusion gene was transformed into the s. cerevislae mutant mpy <dig>  <cit> . the fluorescence signal was visualized with a leica dm4000b fluorescent microscope.

sequence analysis
multiple-sequence alignment of amino acid sequences was achieved with clustalw program http://www.expasy.ch/tools/#align <cit> . a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed in the clustalx program based on the full sequences of the proteins with default parameters  <cit> . the transmembrane domains of proteins were predicted using the tmhmm program http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/.

RESULTS
rice copt family has all the conserved features of known copt/ctr-type cu transporter genes
analysis of the genomic sequences of rice variety nipponbare  revealed seven genes, copt <dig> , copt <dig> , copt <dig> , copt <dig> , copt <dig> , copt <dig> , and copt <dig> , that showed sequence homology with copt or ctr genes from other species  <cit> . the seven copts are located on six of the  <dig> rice chromosomes  . based on the annotation of rice genome annotation project , all seven genes are intron-free. the seven genes are g- and c-rich consisting more than 72% g and c.

the rice copt proteins share 35% to 64% sequence identity and 47% to 73% sequence similarity each other  and have a similar structure , which is similar to copt/ctr proteins in other species  <cit> . the central domains of rice copts are three transmembrane  regions, tm <dig>  tm <dig>  and tm <dig> . tm <dig> and tm <dig> in the copt/ctr proteins of other species are separated by a cytoplasmic loop  <cit> . only a few residues separate tm <dig> and tm <dig> of rice copts . it has been reported that a short loop connecting tm <dig> and tm <dig> is essential for function and it enforces a very tight spatial relationship between these two tm segments at the extracellular side of plasma membrane  <cit> . rice tm <dig> harbors the mxxxm  motif and tm <dig> contains the gxxxg motif, together forming the characteristic mxxxm-x12-gxxxg motif of copt/ctr proteins  <cit> . copt/ctr proteins usually have an extracellular n-terminus and a cytoplasmic c-terminus; the n-terminus is generally rich in conserved methionine-rich motifs, which are important for low level of cu transport; the c-terminus tends to contain cysteine- and/or histidine-rich motifs, such as cxc, which binds cu ions and transfers them to cytosolic cu chaperones  <cit> . all these key features are present in rice copts. copt <dig> and copt <dig> have cytoplasmic c-termini  <cit> . the interactions of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> with alg <dig>  a tm protein, in yeast cells using a split-ubiquitin system for integral membrane proteins  <cit>  suggests that the other five rice copts also have cytoplasmic c-termini . all seven copts have one to four mxm or mxxm motifs at n-termini . the cc motif has been detected in rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> and cxc motif in rice copt <dig> and copt <dig> at the c-termini .

a phylogenetic analysis was performed to examine the evolutionary relationship of  <dig> copt/ctr proteins among rice and other species. this analysis classified these proteins into four groups . group  <dig> includes ctr proteins from humans , mouse , lizard , zebrafish , fruit fly , baker's yeast , fission yeast , and ascomycetes . group  <dig> consists of seven rice copts  and five arabidopsis copts . group  <dig> includes two ctrs from ascomycetes  and baker's yeast , respectively. group  <dig> consists of three ctrs from green algae . this analysis suggests that rice copts are evolutionarily related to arabidopsis copts rather than other copt/ctr proteins. furthermore, rice copt <dig> and copt <dig> are more related to arabidiopsis copt5; rice copt <dig> to copt <dig> are more related to arabidopsis copt <dig> to copt <dig> .

rice copts function alone or cooperatively as high-affinity cu transporters in yeast
a recent study has revealed that rice copt <dig> and copt <dig> alone or cooperatively cannot complement the phenotype of yeast s. cerevisiae mutant mpy <dig>  which lacked the functions of ctr <dig> and ctr <dig> for cu uptake; however, rice copt <dig> and copt <dig> in cooperation with another rice protein xa <dig> can mediate a low-affinity cu transport in yeast mpy <dig> mutant and the three proteins also cooperatively mediate cu transport in rice plants  <cit> . to investigate the potential roles of the other five rice copt genes in cu transport, these genes were expressed separately in mpy <dig> mutant under the control of the constitutive yeast glyceraldehide-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  gene promoter  <cit> . all the transformants were able to grow on sc-his, demonstrating the presence of the expression vector or target gene . the lack of growth of mpy <dig> cells containing empty vector  was restored when transformed with yeast scctr <dig>  in the selective ethanol/glycerol  medium without supplementation of cu. rice copt <dig> but not rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> could replace the function of scctr <dig> in yeast cells. expression of rice copt <dig> alone could efficiently complement the phenotype of mpy <dig> mutant in the medium without supplementation of cu as compared to the positive control .

rice copt <dig> could efficiently complement mpy <dig> phenotype in the medium supplemented with  <dig> μm cu compared to the growth of mpy <dig> cells transformed with copt <dig> and the positive control, in the same medium . rice copt <dig> and copt <dig> could also complement mpy <dig> growth in the medium supplemented with  <dig> μm cu, but with a relatively low efficiency. like rice copt <dig> and copt <dig>  rice copt <dig> could not complement mpy <dig> growth in the medium supplemented with  <dig> μm cu compared to the negative control. to determine whether expression of xa <dig> could enhance the ability of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> to rescue the yeast mutant, we coexpressed these proteins with xa <dig>  coexpression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> with xa <dig> could not complement the phenotype of mpy <dig> , which is consistent with our previous results that these copt proteins can not interact with xa <dig>  <cit> .

however, coexpression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> with copt <dig> efficiently complemented the phenotype of mpy <dig> in the media without supplementation of cu as compared to the positive control, while coexpression of copt2-copt <dig>  copt2-copt <dig>  or copt3-copt <dig> could not complement the phenotype of mpy <dig> . to ascertain whether the cooperation of these two proteins in cu uptake in yeast cells was associated with the physical contact of proteins, the interactions of these copts were analyzed using the split-ubiquitin system. all seven copts could form homodimers in yeast cells . consistent with the complementation analyses, copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> could interact with copt <dig>  in addition to the interaction of copt <dig> with copt <dig> as reported previously   <cit> . no other copt pairs could form heterodimers in the yeast cells. these results suggest that copt <dig> alone and copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> cooperating with copt <dig>  respectively, can mediate a highly efficient cu transport into yeast cells. in addition, copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> alone appear to mediate low-affinity cu transport in yeast cells.

to ascertain whether the requirement of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> with copt <dig> to complement mpy <dig> phenotype was due to copt <dig> affecting the localization of these proteins, we examined the localization of these proteins in the mpy <dig> cells by marking them with gfp. the copt2-gfp, copt3-gfp, or copt4-gfp fusion protein was not or was not largely localized in the plasma membrane of the yeast cells when expressed alone . however, when coexpressed with copt <dig>  copt2-gfp, copt3-gfp, or copt4-gfp was largely localized in the plasma membrane. these results suggest that copt <dig> may function as a cofactor to help the efficient localization of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> in the plasma membrane for mediating cu transport.

rice copts cannot transport fe and zn in yeast
except for cu uptake, copt/ctr proteins have been reported to be involved in transport other substances  <cit> . to ascertain whether rice copts had the capability of transporting other bivalent metal cations in organisms, these copt genes were expressed in yeast s. cerevisiae mutants under the control of the gpd gene promoter. the fet3fet4dey <dig> mutant lacked the fet <dig> and fet <dig> proteins and was defective in both low- and high-affinity fe uptake  <cit> . in the same selective bpds media with or without supplement of fe, yeast mutant cells transformed with one of the seven rice copts showed the same growth pattern as the yeast mutant cells transformed with empty vector ; these cells did not grow in the medium without supplement of fe . however, the wild-type yeast strain dey <dig>  which was transformed with the empty vector, grew well in the media in all the treatments. these results suggest that none of the rice copts alone can mediate fe uptake in yeast.

the zrt1zrt2zhy <dig> mutant lacked the zrt <dig> and zrt <dig> proteins for zn uptake  <cit> . in the selective edta media without supplement of zn, the mutant cells transformed with any one of the rice copts could not grow as the cells transformed with empty vector , whereas the wild-type dey <dig> transformed with the empty vector grew well . these results suggest that rice copts alone cannot transport zn in yeast either.

since coexpression of copt <dig> facilitated expression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> in the plasma membrane of yeast cells , we coexpressed each two of the four proteins in fet3fet4dey <dig> and zrt1zrt2zhy <dig> yeast mutants. coexpression of any two of the four proteins could not complement the phenotypes of the mutants . these results further support the conclusion that rice copts cannot transport fe and zn in yeast.

the expression of copts is influenced by multiple factors
to gain insight into the functions of rice copts, spatiotemporal and tissue-specific expression patterns of these genes were analyzed by qrt-pcr or rt-pcr . copt <dig> and copt <dig> showed similar tissue- and development-specific expression patterns. the two genes had a higher level of expression in root and leaf tissues compared to their expression levels in sheath, stem, and panicle . copt <dig> showed a higher expression level in root than in other tissues. copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> had higher expression levels in young leaves than in old leaves, especially for copt <dig> and copt <dig> . copt <dig> and copt <dig> had relatively higher expression levels in leaf and panicle than in other tissues and copt <dig> had relatively higher expression levels in root and leaf than in other tissues; the three genes showed higher expression levels in old leaves compared with young leaves. copt <dig> was not expressed in root and had a higher expression level in leaf than in other tissues. copt <dig> showed a constitutive expression pattern in different-aged leaves.

the expression of rice copt <dig> and copt <dig> was influenced by cu; copt <dig> and copt <dig> were induced by cu deficiency and suppressed by overdose of cu in both shoot and root tissues  <cit> . the expression of other five rice copts, copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig>  was also influenced by the change of cu levels . copt <dig> showed a similar response as copt <dig> and copt <dig> to cu deficiency and overdose  in both shoot and root compared to the control plants cultured in the medium containing  <dig>  μm cu. although copt <dig> showed constitutive expression in different aged leaves at adult stage , it had a low level of expression in shoot tissue at seedling stage . however, copt <dig> was induced in cu deficiency and suppressed in cu overdose in shoot and no copt <dig> expression was detected either with or without cu deficiency in root . the expression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> was suppressed in cu overdose and was not obviously influenced in cu deficiency in both shoot and root tissues.

interestingly, other bivalent cations also influenced expression of copts . mn deficiency induced copt <dig> in root and copt <dig> and copt <dig> in shoot, and slightly suppressed copt <dig> and copt <dig> in root. zn deficiency induced copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> and slightly suppressed copt <dig> in root and induced copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> in shoot. fe deficiency slightly induced copt <dig> and suppressed copt <dig> and copt <dig> in root and induced copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> in shoot. no copt <dig> expression was detected either with or without mn, zn, or fe deficiency in root .

xoo strain pxo <dig> induced expression of copt <dig> and copt <dig>  which encoding proteins interacted with xa <dig> protein to facilitate xoo infection  <cit> . to ascertain whether the expression of other copts was also response to pathogen infection, rice plants were inoculated with different xoo strains. infection of xoo strain pxo <dig> could not induce copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> . infection of xoo strain pxo <dig> appeared slightly induced in copt <dig> and copt <dig>  although the induction was statistically not significant , but not in other copts . these results suggest that copt members may function differently in different tissues, different developmental stages, and different environments.

discussion
the present results suggest that rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig>  which function alone or cooperatively, can replace the roles of scctr <dig> and scctr <dig> for cu uptake in s. cerevisiae. previous studies have reported that a single plasma membrane-localized copt/ctr-type cu transporter from human , mouse , arabidopsis , lizard , drosophila , or chlamydomonas reinhardtii  could complement the phenotype of s. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant  <cit> . the fission yeast  spctr <dig> and spctr <dig> form a heteromeric plasma membrane complex to complement the s. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant  <cit> ; coexpression of this complex could also restore the phenotype of s. pombe ctr4Δctr5Δ mutant jsy <dig>  <cit> . rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and the mtn3/saliva-type protein xa <dig>  which cooperatively mediate cu transport in rice, can also complement the phenotype of the s. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant  <cit> . these results suggest that the s. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant is a valuable model to study the roles of copt/ctr-type proteins from different species including rice in cu transport. thus, based on the effects of different rice copts on the growth of ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant cells on the selective media and the expression patterns of these copt genes in response to the variation of cu concentration in rice, we argue that copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> may mediate cu transport in rice alone or in cooperation with other copts.

copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> may cooperate with copt <dig> for cu transport in different rice tissues except for root. this hypothesis is supported by the following evidence. first, the complementation of the phenotype of s. cerevisiae ctr1Δctr3Δ mutant by coexpression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> with copt <dig> was consistent with the capability of the physical interaction of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> with copt <dig> . second, copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> were all expressed in stem, sheath, leaf, and panicle tissues . the similar and tissue-specific expression patterns of copt <dig> and copt <dig>  are consistent with their cooperative role in cu transport in shoot and root reported previously  <cit> . however, copt <dig>  copt <dig>  or copt <dig> alone appeared to mediate a low-affinity cu transport in yeast cells, suggesting that they may be also involved in a low-affinity cu transport in different rice tissues or rice cu deficiency alone, although further in planta study is required to examine this hypothesis. this hypothesis is supported by the evidence that copt <dig> and copt <dig> had a relatively high level of expression in root, but no expression of copt <dig> was detected in root; furthermore, the expression of copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> but not copt <dig> in leaves was developmentally regulated . in addition, the expression of copt <dig> but not copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> was strongly induced by cu deficiency in rice shoot . the present results also suggest that copt <dig> may be capable of mediating cu transport alone in rice. according to its expression pattern, copt <dig> may function in different tissues and also in cu deficiency.

except for cu uptake, human hctr <dig> could transport silver   <cit> . this capability of the hctr <dig> occurs because ag is isoelectronic to cu and thus ag competes for cu as the substrate of the hctr <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, scctr <dig>  mctr <dig>  and hctr <dig> could also transport the anticancer drug cisplatin  <cit> . none of the rice copts could restore the fe- or zn-uptake functions of the yeast mutants . overexpressing copt <dig> or copt <dig> or suppressing copt <dig> or copt <dig> in rice had no influence on fe, mn, and zn contents in rice shoot  <cit> . these results suggest that rice copts may function specifically for cu transport among bivalent ions like the other copt/ctr proteins  <cit> . that the copt/ctr proteins could transport cu but not fe, mn, and zn may be related to their protein features. the tm domains of copt/ctr may form a symmetrical homotrimer or heterotrimer channel architecture with a 9-Å diameter that is suitable only for cu transport but not other bivalent ions, such as mn, zn, or fe  <cit> .

however, all the rice copts were transcriptionally activated or suppressed by fe, mn, or zn deficiency . a balance of the concentrations of cu with other bivalent ions appears to be associated with their uptake. the yeast s. cerevisiae ctr <dig> mutants and deletion strains have deficiency in fe uptake  <cit> . the high-affinity fe uptake is influenced by cu concentration in ascomycetes c. albicans; deletion of cactr <dig> for cu uptake results in defective fe uptake  <cit> . excess metals  significantly influenced cu uptake mediated by human hctr <dig>  <cit> . a yeast s. pombe ctr <dig> mutant displays a strong reduction of zn superoxide dismutase activity  <cit> . thus, further study is required to determine whether other bivalent ion levels influence cu uptake in rice.

xoo causes bacterial blight, which is one of the most devastating diseases restricting rice production worldwide. rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and xa <dig> cooperate to promote removal of cu from rice xylem vessels, where xoo multiplies and spreads to cause disease  <cit> . copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and xa <dig> can facilitate the infection of xoo strain pxo <dig> because this bacterium can transcriptionally activate them  <cit> . the present results suggest that xoo-induced expression of copt <dig> and copt <dig> is race specific. although pxo <dig> can induce copt <dig> and copt <dig>  <cit> , the expression of the two genes was not markedly influenced by xoo strain pxo <dig> in the infection sites . neither pxo <dig> nor pxo <dig> influenced the expression of rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> in the infection sites, suggesting that these copt genes are not directly involved in the interactions between rice and at least the two xoo strains.

CONCLUSIONS
like rice copt <dig> and copt <dig>  <cit> , rice copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  copt <dig>  and copt <dig> also appear to be plasma membrane proteins for they can replace the roles of s. cerevisiae plasma membrane-localized scctr <dig> and scctr <dig> for cu uptake. however, different from copt <dig> and copt <dig>  the other five copts may not be directly associated with the rice-xoo interaction. the present results provide tissue and interaction targets of different copts for further study of their roles in cu transport and associated physiological activities in rice.
