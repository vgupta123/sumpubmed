BACKGROUND
it has been suggested that ecosystem fragmentation has important consequences for animal populations by reducing and dividing the distribution areas and by limiting connections between the fragments  <cit> . as a result, this natural or anthropological phenomenon is described as a process promoting the genetic differentiation of isolated populations and could be involved in speciation. insects are interesting models for studying the effects of fragmentation owing to their abundance, limited dispersal, short generation time and sensitivity to disturbances. in tropical ecosystems, termites  may represent up to 95% of soil insect biomass; humivorous termites contribute to tropical soil fertilization  <cit> . since soil-feeders are very sensitive to changes in their environment, they constitute interesting bio-indicators in landscape fragmentation studies, when the evolution of their specific richness is surveyed  <cit> .

studying the link between genetics and fragmentation requires evaluation of breeding structure, gene flow and genetic differentiation among populations. this implies unambiguous identification of species. for a long time, termite systematics was based on morphological and\or morphometrical character sets for individuals belonging to various castes . during the past decade, an increasing number of taxonomic studies have shown that molecular methods constitute fast and reliable diagnostic systems, which complement morphological identification. indeed, several studies based on mitochondrial genome sequences such as the cytochrome oxidase genes, the at-rich region and the 16s rdna have thrown a great deal of light on termite taxonomy and on phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of the reticulitermes  <cit> , nasutitermes  <cit>  and heterotermes  <cit>  genera. because mitochondrial gene trees do not necessarily reflect species trees owing to their maternal inheritance, the addition of nuclear markers in molecular studies is useful for confirming the organismal phylogeny  <cit> . among the nuclear sequences, the internal transcribed spacers  of rdna are more polymorphic between than within species. it is generally assumed than concerted evolution homogenizes individual rdna repeats and produces a mostly uniform sequence in all repeats in a given species. although there is intra-individual variation in some taxa, the its <dig> region sequences are considered phylogenetically informative and able to distinguish closely-related species  <cit> . such an evolutionary pattern has allowed sibling or cryptic species in the reticulitermes genus to be discriminated  <cit> . microsatellites are also very useful nuclear polymorphic markers and have contributed widely to the resolution of colony and population genetic structures in isoptera  <cit> . many surveys have concerned the xylophageous genus,reticulitermes, in non-natural fragmented areas such as urban ecosystems  <cit> . to date, however, microsatellite markers have not been used to investigate termite phylogeny or species discrimination, as has been done for other groups e.g. vertebrates  <cit> , ticks  <cit> , wasps  <cit>  and ants  <cit> .

in the present survey, we studied the humivorous afro-tropical cubitermes genus , which shows remarkable ecological plasticity, colonizing savannahs or forests according to species. among the soil-feeding termitidae, the cubitermes genus is one of the main builders; its nest can shelter up to  <dig> genera of true inquiline or optional builder termites  <cit> . in spite of its undeniable ecological interest, the taxonomy of this genus is poorly resolved and a complete revision appears necessary  <cit> . indeed, at least  <dig> species of cubitermes have been described on the basis of morphometrical characters, but it is strongly suspected that some of these are synonymic. it is important to note that extensive taxonomic work is necessary for the west african species since the sole currently available key concerns the east african species  <cit> . molecular data are also lacking for the cubitermes genus, as only one sequence from cytochrome oxidase i  <cit>  and two from 12s mtdna  are registered.

the aim of this work is to clarify the taxonomic status of the cubitermes colonies from the lopé reserve region , in order to obtain a better understanding of tropical termite diversity in fragmented areas. the lopé reserve is typically characterized by a mosaic of forests and savannahs and constitutes an ideal setting for studies of natural fragmentation.

on the basis of morphological comparisons with type specimens in the collections of the british museum  and the royal museum for central africa , and because they showed no diagnostic morphometrical variation or molecular divergence in mitochondrial 12s and 16s rdna , the cubitermes colonies were affiliated to a single species, cubitermes sp. affinis subarquatus . here we attempt to reconstruct a phylogeny based on three types of polymorphic and independent molecular markers. we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial coii gene and the its <dig> region, and determined the genotypes at five microsatellite loci isolated from cubitermes subarquatus  <cit> , for  <dig> cubitermes colonies from four different sites . three of these sites were in the same geographical scale within the lopé reserve and corresponded to forest patches of different ages, including small savannah patches: okoumé , rocher  and chameau . a fourth site, doda, was an isolated gallery-forest outside the reserve within a savannah landscape.

RESULTS
mitochondrial sequence analyses
mitochondrial sequence dataset consisted in  <dig> bp sequenced for one individual from each of the  <dig> colonies collected in the four sites, and for the outgroup taxa, apilitermes longiceps and crenetermes albotarsalis .

in total for the cubitermes sequences,  <dig> nucleotidic sites were variable  and the overall proportion of a+t reached  <dig> %. height haplotypes were scored  differing at 1– <dig> nucleotide sites . maximum parsimony , bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  reconstructions clearly showed four distinct coii haplotype groups . we named the first clade cubitermes spa, including sequences from the t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t14a colonies. the second clade, named cubitermes spb, included t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t14b sequences. the third clade, cubitermes spc, comprised t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and tx sequences and the fourth group, cubitermes spd, only the two sequences from the colonies of the doda site, td <dig> and td <dig> 

genbank accession numbers  and haplotype names  for coii and its <dig> sequences and allele ranges  for the five microsatellite loci. n, number of individuals tested for each of the  <dig> cubitermes colonies of the four geographical sites and for a. longiceps and c. albotarsalis and n, number of microsatellite alleles found in each locus and putative cryptic species.

sequence divergence was quite low within these groups. indeed, in the cubitermes spa group, only one haplotype was detected and sequence divergence was inferior to 1% within cubitermes spb and cubitermes spc groups .

on the opposite, the divergence between the four mitochondrial lineages was high. the cubitermes spa and cubitermes spb sequences differed from each other by  <dig> % , cubitermes spa and cubitermes spc by  <dig> % and cubitermes spb and cubitermes spc by  <dig> %. finally, cubitermes spd diverged by  <dig> % from cubitermes spa.

its <dig> sequence analyses
a total of  <dig> positions sequenced for one individual from each of the  <dig> cubitermes colonies, for apilitermes longiceps and crenetermes albotarsalis were aligned for its <dig> sequences. regarding cubitermes sequences, we found  <dig> invariable sites,  <dig> alignment gaps and  <dig> polymorphic sites. mp, bi and ml reconstructions confirmed the four lineages found with the coii gene . however, the position of cubitermes spd was quite different since it was not found univocally clustered with cubitermes spa. in this its <dig> tree, high bi posterior probabilities, ml and mp bootstrap support values were found for grouping cubitermes spa, c. spd and c. spc in the same clade  whereas a lower resolution of this branch appeared in the tree of mtdna haplotypes .

sequence data from its <dig> revealed no polymorphism within the putative four species. since no heterozygote was detected, its <dig> sequences were assigned to four unique haplotypes .

again, divergence between groups was high in comparison with within-group divergence. haplotypes of cubitermes spa differed from the cubitermes spc haplotypes by  <dig> % . the cubitermes spa and cubitermes spb haplotypes differed from each other by  <dig> % and cubitermes spb and cubitermes spc by  <dig> %. finally, the haplotype of cubitermes spd differed from the haplotype of cubitermes spa by  <dig> %.

microsatellite analyses
a total of  <dig> individuals for the  <dig> nests were surveyed at five microsatellite loci. the genetic differentiation among colonies within each putative species  was substantially low. otherwise, very high genetic differentiation was detected between colonies of different cubitermes putative species. cubitermes spa and cubitermes spd were the less differentiated  followed by cubitermes spa and cubitermes spc groups . cubitermes spa and cubitermes spb  and cubitermes spb and cubitermes spc  showed similar high patterns of differentiation.

the nj trees based on the das distance, the minimum genetic distance of nei and the chord distance  showed a genetic structure with four main clusters .

discussion
in tropical soil-feeding termites, it is impractical to apply a biological species concept  <cit>  because of the difficulties in realizing experimental crosses and observing natural hybridizations. thus, our purpose here was to apply a phylogenetic species recognition  based on the genealogical concordance concept  <cit>  to diagnose the cubitermes species or to detect cryptic species. such a concept has often been applied in bacteria, fungi and animals. in termites, research involving dna-based taxonomy of structural and agricultural pest species is important  <cit> . comparison of multiple molecular markers has allowed the taxonomic status of new species in reticulitermes to be assessed  <cit>  and has provided evidence for species synonymy in this genus  <cit> . many dna-based species recognitions are corroborated by evidence of morphological/chemical differences or geographically defined groups. however, psr can be a powerful tool for diagnosing otherwise undistinguishable species, because genetic changes occurring in recently-isolated species may be observed before morphological or behavioral changes arise  <cit> . as found recently in other social insects, genetic isolation is not always accompanied by evident morphological differentiation. in fire ants belonging to the solenopsis genus, genetic analyses based on allozyme and mitochondrial markers demonstrated the occurrence of sympatric and indistinguishable cryptic species  <cit> .

the genetic results obtained in our study from the combined mitochondrial, nuclear and microsatellite markers unequivocally show deep separation among four groups of genotypes in the cubitermes sp. affinis subarquatus colonies from the lopé reserve region. the congruence of these three types of unlinked molecular markers strongly supports the existence of differentiated genetic pools in this limited area. the mitochondrial and nuclear sequences show very little variation within the four groups but there is considerable variation among them. although the allele ranges overlap for all the loci, possibly because of size homoplasy, the microsatellite data confirm the occurrence of four differentiated groups. these unexpected levels of subdivision are unlikely to have arisen under gene flow, so these four newly-detected groups can be seen as good evidence for the existence of cryptic species previously unrecognized by morphological techniques.

the lack of detectable morphological differences among cubitermes species is not surprising in view of the data in the taxonomic literature, which imply that the genus is highly complex   <cit> . furthermore, the boundaries between nominal cubitermes species are often concealed by intra-specific morphometrical variability. in his revision of the east african cubitermes species, williams  <cit>  mentioned that most of the specific characters vary greatly in size and can also vary markedly in shape and proportion within a particular species.

in addition, our genetic data inform the current debate about the use of comparative phylogenetic methods for studying present-day species distributions. these distributions do not necessarily reflect the geographical range of the ancestral species at the time of speciation, because geographical distributions are often labile owing to climate fluctuations, territory expansion or extinction of competitors. in particular, we have certainly not sampled the entire species range and enabled definite conclusions to be drawn about biogeographic differentiation and speciation. however, the repartition of the cryptic cubitermes species is quite interesting in relation to the species distributions of poorly dispersive insects.

in our study, we can consider two landscape units:  the lopé reserve south of the ogooué river, where cubitermes spa, c. spb and c. spc live sympatrically in the closely apposed sites of okoumé, chameau and rocher, the only exception being that cubitermes spa is absent from the chameau site;  the doda zone to the north, where cubitermes spd is restricted to the distant and isolated gallery-forest of doda and represents the only cubitermes species in the doda zone across  <dig> km. the ecological differentiation of the two zones results from paleogeographic events. indeed, since the last glaciations, the north ogooué has progressively run dry, resulting in the regression of all forest types except riparian. in the south ogooué, a wet environment has been maintained by the well-developed hydro-geographical network and this has allowed the forest to be preserved.

the contemporary sympatric distributions of three of the cubitermes species  in the reserve zone could reflect their ability to disperse within a mosaic of forests of variable ages  and savannah "buffer-zones". indeed, their dispersion seems not to be affected by fragmentation on this small scale. little is known about the dispersion modalities and the reproductive strategies of the cubitermes species. it is very likely that swarming  is the main mode of dispersal in this genus, since budding  is not as common in termitidae as in lower termites  <cit> . it has been suggested that although the active flight of winged termites is very limited , the meteorological conditions accompanying dispersal flights could strongly influence the distance covered by these sexual alates. actually, a recent genetic study of macrotermes michaelseni  suggested that some winged termites can travel considerable distances , most likely by passive drift  <cit> . furthermore, the effectiveness of dispersal obviously depends upon the number of alates and the rate of predation  <cit> .

finally, the particular distribution pattern of cubitermes spd raises the question of the link between the history of the forest fragmentation and the modalities of speciation. one can indeed wonder whether the history of successive modifications of habitats in this geographical zone has not contributed to the isolation of the termite species populating it. areas such as isolated gallery forests, like doda, may constitute refuges for fauna, where some species are led to disappear while others begin to differentiate under the influence of genetic drift.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers provides a reliable diagnostic method for separating cubitermes species and offers a complement to the morphometrical diagnostic. furthermore, these molecular markers could reveal useful information about their phylogenetical relationships. similarly, such methods could be extended to termites for which species taxonomy is ambiguous.
