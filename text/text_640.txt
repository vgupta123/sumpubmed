BACKGROUND
small rnas  regulate many developmental and physiological processes in plants through the regulation of gene expression at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level  <cit> . they can be subdivided into short-interfering rnas  and micrornas   <cit> .

micrornas are derived from capped and polyadenylated primary -mirna transcripts that are transcribed by rna polymerase ii and can form a hairpin-loop structure by intramolecular pairing  <cit> . two sequential cleavages mediated by dicer like  <dig>  are required to produce a mature mirna  <cit> . in the first cleavage, dcl <dig> cleaves near the base of the hairpin-loop stem of the pri-mirna to produce a mirna precursor . the second cleavage takes place near the loop of the pre-mirna to produce a mirna/mirna* duplex. the mature mirna is then loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex  and can guide the sequence-specific cleavage or translational inhibition of target mrnas  <cit> , as well as gene silencing through dna methylation  <cit> , whereas the non-incorporated mirna* strand is usually degraded.

through the use of next-generation sequencing, the small rna component of the arabidopsis and rice transcriptomes has been well characterized, more than in any other plant species  <cit> . this is reflected in the mirbase database , where  <dig> mirnas are described for arabidopsis whereas  <dig> mirnas are described for rice. besides rice, the identification of mirnas through deep sequencing in other grasses including maize, wheat, and brachypodium have been described  <cit> . the identification of rice, maize and wheat mirnas from different tissues, developmental stages and stress-treatments  <cit> , provides an opportunity to understand how mirnas regulate the expression of genes influencing traits of agronomic importance. currently, a trait of particular relevance for biofuel production is that of sugar accumulation in the stem of sorghum  and sugarcane , two closely related c <dig> grasses that diverged from each other about 8- <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

in both species, sucrose is the main type of sugar and accumulates in the parenchyma tissue of the juicy stems  <cit> . high sucrose content is a highly desirable trait since the accumulated sugar can be fermented to produce bioethanol as a source of renewable energy  <cit> . although sugarcane has been extensively used as a source of biofuel, its use as a model system to understand the genetics of sugar accumulation is hampered by its complex genome, with several cultivars differing greatly in their ploidy levels  <cit> . sorghum instead, is a diploid species and its genome has been recently sequenced  <cit> . in addition, the intra-species variation for sugar content is much more pronounced in sorghum than in sugarcane  <cit> , with sorghum cultivars known as sweet sorghums accumulating high levels of sugars relative to grain sorghums  <cit> . this makes sorghum a more suitable system to study the genetic basis of sugar accumulation. still, the gene repertoire involved in sugar accumulation is not well characterized in sorghum due to the low heritability of the trait and its quantitative inheritance. in addition, previous reports have suggested the existence of trade-offs between sugar content and other plant traits such as flowering time  <cit> .

we also observed that sugar accumulation  in the stem of grain sorghum btx <dig> and sweet sorghum rio cultivars differed at the time of flowering. interestingly, 80% of the differentially expressed genes in stem tissue between the two cultivars had orthologous counterparts in syntenic positions in rice  <cit> . this suggested that the ability of sorghum to accumulate soluble sugars relative to rice could not be explained by differences in their gene content but rather due to gene regulation at either the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. to address the latter possibility, we characterized the small rna portion of transcriptomes derived from stem tissues of grain and sweet sorghum in order to investigate the microrna-mediated regulation of genes involved in sugar accumulation and flowering time. using the solid next generation sequencing system, we sequenced with an unprecedented depth small rnas libraries from btx <dig> and rio, and from a pool of selected f <dig> plants derived from their cross that differed in sugar content and flowering time. we also reasoned that plant stems would provide us with a representative tissue to experimentally validate the previously predicted mirnas of the sorghum genome  <cit> . indeed, we not only detected the expression of  <dig> mirna families from the  <dig> predicted families in the sorghum genome but also discovered  <dig> new mirna candidates. furthermore, we could correlate genotypic variation of mirna expression with the sugar and flowering phenotypes. in addition, we found that the size distribution of small rnas in sorghum stems was quite heterogeneous, characterized by rnas with at least  <dig> nt in length that were mainly derived from ribosomal and transfer rnas not annotated in the sorghum genome.

RESULTS
deep-sequencing of small rnas from grain and sweet sorghum stems
we constructed five small rnas libraries from sorghum stem tissue at the time of flowering and sequenced them using the solid platform. the libraries comprised samples from btx <dig>  rio, low brix and early flowering f <dig> plants , high brix and late flowering f <dig> plants , and a "mixed library" , where small rnas from the previous four libraries were mixed in equal proportions .

we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, from which  <dig> , <dig>  matched perfectly to the btx <dig> reference genome . the reads with perfect matches that derived from repeats constituted  <dig> to 77% of the total reads depending on the library . the non-redundant set of reads comprised  <dig> , <dig> sequences, and the reads that were sequenced only once  comprised  <dig> , <dig> sequences, corresponding only to 9% of the perfect matches , suggesting that our sequencing reached a high level of saturation. if we define a cluster as two or more reads with identical sequences, the number of clusters found ranged from  <dig>  in the btx <dig> library to  <dig>  in the hb/lf f2s library .

diversity in the small rna content of sorghum stems
the frequency and size distribution of small rnas from sorghum stems revealed two interesting aspects: a peak of  <dig> nt small rnas with similar abundance as the  <dig> nt class, and a second peak of small rnas with  <dig> nt that were more abundant than the  <dig> and  <dig> nt classes, respectively . this finding contrasted with the size distribution of small rnas described for several monocot species , in which the most abundant small rnas were  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length, with maize being the exception, showing a larger  <dig> nt peak relative to the  <dig> nt peak  <cit> . this led to the hypothesis that the  <dig> nt class of small rnas are specific to maize  <cit> . however, we have shown here that a  <dig> nt peak is also present in sorghum stem tissue. furthermore, we found that a high proportion of the  <dig> nt reads were derived from mir172c, accounting for approximately 15% of all the  <dig> nt reads in the btx <dig> library . our results differ from the predicted length of  <dig> nt for mir172c annotated in the mirbase database. interestingly, mir172c is located within the third intron of the sb04g <dig> gene.

the finding of small rnas of  <dig> nt in length with such high abundance was unexpected. this prompted us to investigate whether they could be derived from ribosomal and/or transfer rna genes that had not yet been annotated in the sorghum genome. furthermore, since the sequencing read length of the solid system at the time of our experiment was limited to a maximum of  <dig> nucleotides, it is possible that these rnas are longer. in order to address this question, we analyzed several loci in the genome that accumulated more than thousand reads  and found indeed that they were derived from non-annotated rrna and trna genes .

in summary, we showed that the small rna component from the stem transcriptome of sorghum is characterized by small rnas of  <dig> nt in length that are mainly derived from mir172c, and by a size class of rnas with at least  <dig> nt in length that are predominantly derived from rrnas and trnas genes that had not been annotated in the sorghum genome.

genotypic variation in the expression of known mirnas between grain and sweet sorghum correlated with sugar content and flowering time in the f <dig> population
the sequencing consortium of the sorghum genome identified  <dig> predicted mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families  <cit> , and we could detect the expression of mirna members from  <dig> families based on the following criteria: a mirna family was considered expressed only if its sequencing reads were detected in at least three libraries and with a frequency of  <dig> reads or more for the sum of the five libraries. a list with the reads count for each known mirna family is provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

the most abundantly expressed mirna family was mir <dig> , comprising almost 6% of the total reads with perfect match to the btx <dig> genome. the rest of the known mirnas had abundances below  <dig> % . when the ratio of mirna abundances between the btx <dig> and rio libraries was compared to the ratio between the lb/ef f2s and hb/lf f2s libraries, we could identify mirna families whose expression differences between the parents were inherited in the f <dig> plants . considering a cutoff level of two-fold change in mirna expression, we found that mir <dig> and mir <dig> were expressed higher in btx <dig> relative to rio, and higher in lb/ef f2s compared to hb/lf f2s. this means that high expression of these mirnas in btx <dig> correlated with low brix and early flowering in the f <dig> plants selected, and the opposite was true for mir <dig> . although the expression difference of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> between btx <dig> and rio was inherited in the f <dig>  and thus of interest for further analysis, it was less than two fold; so we decided to focus on mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> instead. the observation that high expression of mir <dig> correlated with early flowering is consistent with the reported role of this mirna in the promotion of flowering  <cit> .

although mir <dig> and mir <dig> have known roles in drought stress and sulphur starvation, respectively  <cit> , our data suggested a possible function for these mirnas in sugar accumulation and flowering time. because the pool of f <dig> plants used for library construction were selected based on both phenotypes, it was not possible to assign the expression inheritance pattern of both mirnas to either sugar accumulation or flowering time alone. for this reason, additional plants from the same f <dig> population differing in sugar content but with similar flowering time were selected and the expression of a representative member from each mirna family, mir169d and mir395f respectively, was quantified using the taqman assay. we found that high expression of mir169d in btx <dig> correlated with low brix . this suggested that high expression levels of mir <dig> might lead to a reduction in stem sugar content regardless of flowering time. surprisingly, high expression of mir395f in rio relative to that in btx <dig> did not correlate with sugar content in f <dig> plants . this might indicate that high expression of mir <dig> would be required for flowering regardless of sugar content in the stem. consistent with the role of mir <dig> in flowering, we did not observe any difference in the expression of mir172a in f <dig> plants with the same flowering time but different brix .

in summary, high expression of mir <dig> in btx <dig> correlated with early flowering in the f <dig>  whereas the opposite was true for mir <dig>  high expression of this mirna in rio correlated with late flowering in the f <dig> plants selected. regarding sugar content in the stem, high expression of mir <dig> in btx <dig> correlated with low brix in the f <dig> plants selected.

genotypic variation in the mir395/mir395* ratio
we detected the expression of the mirna* for all mir <dig> gene copies and this was more evident in rio compared to btx <dig>  and in some instances the abundance of mir395* was even higher than that of mir <dig> such as the case of mir395l* for instance . indeed, when the mir395/mir395* ratio was calculated for each library, we found that mir <dig> reads were approximately  <dig> times more abundant than mir395* reads in the btx <dig> library . by contrast, the abundance of mir <dig> relative to mir395* was in equal proportions in the rio library. our data highlighted a genotypic difference in the ratio between mir <dig> and mir395*, with a switch in strand abundance from btx <dig> to rio .

the frl <dig> and rr <dig> genes are novel targets of mir172
although our data might suggest a possible function of mir <dig> in sugar content and mir <dig> in flowering time, we could not detect any predicted target related to carbohydrate metabolism and flowering time respectively . thus, the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> target genes, and their correlation with brix and flowering phenotypes remains to be elucidated. regarding the mir172-predicted targets, we detected cleavage products for the genes indeterminate spikelet  <dig>  and an ap <dig> transcription factor . furthermore, when the expression of these two mir <dig> target genes was tested, we found that they were expressed higher in rio compared with btx <dig> as expected. however, we could not find a correlation between their expression levels with the flowering phenotype in the f <dig> pools of plants selected .

a frigida-like  <dig>  and a type a response regulator  <dig>  were predicted as new targets of mir <dig> with the cleavage product of frl <dig> experimentally validated in this study . the frigida-related genes are a major determinant of natural variation in the winter-annual habit between arabidopsis accessions  <cit> , whereas the type a response regulator  <dig>  has a function in the circadian clock  <cit> . although sorghum is a crop from semi-arid regions  <cit> , the mir172-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of frl <dig> might have a role in the adaptation of sorghum to temperate climates. consistent with this, a role of mir <dig> in the regulation of flowering time by ambient temperature in arabidopsis has been recently described  <cit> .

identification of new mirnas
the mirdeep pipeline  <cit>  was adapted for de novo detection of mirnas in sorghum . from an original set of  <dig> predicted hairpins in the sorghum genome,  <dig> met the mirna annotation criteria previously established  <cit> , . all the new mirnas have predicted genes as targets except mir <dig> . all predicted  <dig> mirnas met the expression criteria used above for known mirnas . from all mirnas whose expression could be detected in sorghum stems, two of them were found to be within introns of protein coding genes, these included mir172c and mir437g.

*all the small rna reads mapped to "chromosome_7_ <dig> bc_03" were derived from the predicted mirna* strand

from the newly identified mirnas, mir <dig>  and mir <dig> displayed allelic variation in expression between btx <dig> and rio that was inherited in the f <dig> offspring . however, the predicted target genes for mir <dig> did not include any transcript involved neither in flowering nor in carbohydrate metabolism. this was a similar case with mir <dig>  with no predicted targets involved in flowering but with two genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism as predicted targets, encoding the beta subunit  <dig> and  <dig> of the snf- <dig> related protein kinase  respectively  <cit>  .

we next attempted to experimentally validate the mirna-mediated cleavage of predicted targets. potential mirna target sites were scored from  <dig> to  <dig> , with higher scores indicating less confidence in the predictions. we tested  <dig> predicted targets with scores less than  <dig> but we could not detect the mirna-mediated cleavage for any of them. a low rate in target validation has also been observed for newly predicted mirnas in tomato, with three targets validated from  <dig> predicted targets that were tested  <cit> . recently, a similar case of very low rate in target validation was reported for predicted targets of new mirnas identified in arabidopsis lyrata  <cit> .

discussion
here we have described the first characterization of the small rna component of the transcriptome from sorghum stems. the choice of stems as plant material is interesting not only because it is the tissue were fermentable sugars do accumulate, but it is also the venue for the movement of small rna duplexes  from source to sink tissues, as have been recently demonstrated  <cit> . thus, one could expect the small rna component of the stem to be quite diverse or heterogeneous. indeed, the unexpected finding of a high abundance peak of rnas with  <dig> nt or more in length lead us to the finding of rrna and trna genes that have not been annotated yet in the sorghum genome. we have also shown that the abundance of the  <dig> nt small rnas in sorghum stem tissue was greater than the  <dig> and  <dig> nt small rnas respectively. our results contrast the recently proposed notion that the  <dig> nt peak of small rnas is exclusive of maize  <cit> . furthermore, we found that up to 15% of all the  <dig> nt small rnas in the btx <dig> library were derived from mir172c, which has been previously predicted to have a length of  <dig> nt . recently,  <dig> nt mirnas have been described to trigger sirna biogenesis from target transcripts in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, it would be interesting to test if mir172c can also trigger sirna biogenesis in sorghum.

as expected, the specific genetic material, tissue sample and developmental stage used in our study, allowed us to capture a broad spectrum of the small rna component of the sorghum transcriptome. on the other hand, the specificity of the material also permitted us to gain new insights into how complex traits like sugar accumulation and flowering time might be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. such regulation of gene expression could provide an opportunity to manipulate biofuel traits, where stem sugar rather than cellulose and increased biomass because of delayed flowering could be enhanced  <cit> . by taking a genetic approach in conjunction with deep-sequencing of stem-derived small rnas, we were able to correlate variation in mirna expression between grain and sweet sorghum, with the sugar and flowering phenotypes of selected f <dig> plants derived from their cross. however, analysis of the differential accumulation of potential target genes did not exhibit a simple correlation with mirna levels. therefore, further studies will be required to unveil the underlying mechanisms between genotype and phenotype.

in the case of mir <dig>  it is interesting to note that there was genotypic variation in the mir395/mir395* ratio, with the rio genotype expressing both strands at equal proportions in contrast to a clear predominance of mir <dig> abundance over mir395* in btx <dig> . this is reminiscent of the recently proposed "arm switching" model of mirna evolution described for nematodes species  <cit> , in which the mature mirna is produced from the 5' arm of the mirna hairpin in a particular species but in a different nematode species the 5' arm of the same mir gene gives rise to the mirna* instead. interestingly, it has been shown recently that mirna* species have physiological relevance in drosophila, since a significant number of them are well conserved, can be loaded into the risc complex through their preferential association with argonaute <dig>  rather that ago <dig>  and can also regulate the expression of target genes  <cit> . furthermore, the regulatory potential of mirna* species in vertebrates has been recently demonstrated as well  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on the above, several interesting questions can be formulated. first, does mir395* have any regulatory potential? second, what is the mechanism behind the genotypic difference in mir395/mir395* ratio? third, is this ratio altered in a developmental and/or tissue dependent manner? fourth, is this an example of a general phenomenon? if this is the case, we would envision that other mirnas families as well will display differences in their mirna/mirna* ratio dependent on the genotype and/or condition. future work will be required to provide a better understanding of mir395's involvement in processes other than its previously described role in sulfur metabolism.
