BACKGROUND
hd is a chemical weapon that can produce casualties in military situations and has been used with devastating results against civilian populations  <cit> . extensive and slow healing lesions following exposure to hd can place a heavy burden on the medical services of military and public health organizations. the design of effective countermeasures to hd depends upon a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms for its toxicity. important mechanisms of hd induced skin injury are alkylation of dna and other macromolecules, accompanied by enhanced reactive oxygen species  generation and depletion of intracellular glutathione   <cit> . depletion of gsh by hd and its metabolites is known to shift the intracellular redox milieu toward a more oxidized state with a subsequent loss of protection against oxidative free radicals and an activation of inflammatory responses <cit> .

it has been shown that hd induces a vast "spectrum" of inflammatory cytokines released from keratinocytes  <cit> . it is likely that cees cause similar changes in macrophages and leukocytes. we previously found that lps, as well as inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha  and interleukin one-beta , significantly amplify the toxicity of cees in raw <dig>  macrophages  <cit> . in macrophages, stimulation by lps, as well as by pro-inflammatory cytokines, leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of nf-κb  <cit> . one of the major consequences of such activation in macrophages is an induction of inos expression with subsequent elevation of intracellular no  <cit> . the effect of cees on no generation and on the nf-κb pathway is potentially significant since no signalling plays an important role in inflammation, the mechanisms of cell death nf-κb  <cit> , and wound healing  <cit> . the present work describes the inhibition of no production and inos expression in lps stimulated macrophages treated with cees.

RESULTS
cees transiently suppresses no production and inos expression in lps stimulated cells
in figure 1a, we examined nitrite secretion into the cell culture medium by raw  <dig>  murine macrophages after  <dig> hours of treatment with cees and various levels of lps. nitrite level in the cell culture medium, as measured by the griess reagent, is a reliable indicator of nitric oxide secretion. these data show that cees  inhibited the secretion of no into the cell medium by lps stimulated macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. low levels of cees  only partially inhibited no production, whereas levels higher than  <dig> μm completely inhibited no production. although cees does decrease the viability of lps stimulated macrophages  <cit> , the decreased generation of no cannot be accounted simply for the loss of viable cells. figure 1b shows that in case nitrite levels in the culture medium  are normalized to the amount of viable cells  there is still a significant cees dose dependent inhibition of no formation.

in order to determine if cees influenced cellular levels of inos, we performed western blot analyses  of the cell lysates using highly selective anti-inos antibodies with equal amounts of total protein applied to each lane. control raw  <dig>  macrophages had no detectable inos protein, cees treatment alone did not induce any inos protein but lps  produced a marked induction of inos protein. when simultaneously treated with lps  and cees  there was a marked reduction in the lps induction of inos protein.

we then examined the influence of  <dig> μm cees on the time course of no production in macrophage stimulated with  <dig> ng/ml lps. figure 2a shows that cees delays, but does not prevent, the production of no  in lps-stimulated macrophages. in fact, after  <dig> hours the rate of no production is about the same in cells treated with lps alone compared with cells treated with both lps and cees. western blot data  from the cells used in figure 2a show a similar pattern: lps alone induces robust inos protein expression which is completely inhibited by cees for up to  <dig> hours. after  <dig> hours, however, the cells incubated with both cees and lps show a rebound in the expression of inos and after  <dig> hours the inos protein level in cells treated with both cees and lps is very similar to that observed in cells treated with lps alone. these data show that the influence of cees on both nitric oxide synthesis and inos expression is transient.

cees does not inhibit inos enzymatic activity in vitro
in order to evaluate the possible direct inhibitory effect of cees on inos activity in vitro, we measured the intracellular rates of  <dig> -diaminofluorescein  or dichlorofluorescin  oxidation in intact macrophages. dichlorofluorescin diacetate  is permeable to the cell plasma membrane and intracellular esterases convert it into a membrane impermeable  form which is can be oxidized to highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescein  by free radicals. in macrophages, the oxidation of dcfh has been shown to be a sensitive and relatively selective probe for monitoring intracellular no formation by inos  <cit> .

using dcfh-da and daf-2da, we were able to continuously monitor no formation in intact macrophages under a variety of conditions. previously, we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have shown that lps exclusively induces the inos form of nitric oxide synthase in murine macrophages. figure 3a shows dcfh oxidation in raw  <dig>  cells stimulated with different levels of lps for  <dig> hours. in the absence of lps, the rate of dcfh oxidation was extremely low but increased with increasing exposure to lps; however, this effect was nearly saturated at lps levels above  <dig> ng/ml.

we then measured the rates of daf- <dig> oxidation in raw  <dig>  macrophages stimulated with  <dig> ng/ml lps in the presence or absence of  <dig> μm cees during  <dig> hour incubations . in the absence of lps or cees, minimal daf- <dig> oxidation was observed. as expected, lps alone induced a marked increase in daf- <dig> oxidation. next, macrophages incubated with lps for  <dig> hours were then exposed  to  <dig> μm cees and the rate of daf- <dig> oxidation immediately measured. as shown in figure 3b, there was no change in rate of daf- <dig> oxidation compared to cells treated with lps alone. these data strongly support the notion that cees does not directly inhibit inos enzymatic activity. similar results were obtained with dcfh-da staining . as expected, macrophages simultaneously treated with both lps and cees for  <dig> hours show a marked decrease in either daf- <dig> or dcfh oxidation.

to further confirm that dcfh oxidation is overwhelmingly due to inos, we incubated lps-stimulated macrophages with ebselen . ebselen is a selenoorganic compound that can inhibit both the activity of inos  <cit>  and its induction by lps  <cit> . ebselen  almost completely inhibited the dcfh oxidation in raw  <dig>  cells treated with  <dig> ng/ml or  <dig> ng/ml lps. ebselen was not cytotoxic at the levels used in figure  <dig> .

discussion
overall, the experiments detailed in this work show that cees treatment in lps-stimulated raw <dig>  murine macrophages transiently inhibits intracellular no generation by interfering with inos expression rather than by direct inhibition of inos enzymatic activity. cees  undergo rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solutions and this may account, in part, for the transitory nature of its inhibiting effect on inos induction  <cit> . lps is a major component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria and is known to trigger a variety of inflammatory reactions in macrophages and other cells expressing cd <dig> receptors  <cit> . lps is ubiquitous and is present in serum, tap water, and dust. military and civilian personnel would, indeed, always have some degree of exposure to environmental lps.

lps stimulation of macrophages is known to involve the activation of protein phosphorylation by kinases as well as the activation of nuclear transcription factors such as nf-κb  <cit> . an important consequence of nf-κb activation in macrophages is the induction of inos expression followed with highly elevated no production  <cit> . nitric oxide has been demonstrated to have an important role in promoting cell death; however, the precise nature of this role varies with cell type and the dose. low levels of nitric oxide protect raw  <dig>  macrophages from hydrogen peroxide induced apoptosis  <cit> , however, nitric oxide has also been reported to induce apoptosis in j <dig> macrophages  <cit> . nitric oxide can induce cell death through energy depletion-induced necrosis and oxidant-induced apoptosis.

we are currently exploring the potential molecular mechanism whereby cees interferes with inos expression in lps stimulated macrophages. it is possible that gsh depletion caused by cees determines inos expression. there are strong evidences suggesting that thiol depletion and inos expression are interrelated  <cit> . for example, lps stimulated macrophages depleted of gsh exhibit a decreased level of inos protein and nitrite production  <cit> . similarly, both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit>  studies show that hepatocytes depleted of gsh have a diminished production of nitric oxide which is primarily due to a decreased level of inos mrna. vos et al.  <cit>  have also presented evidence showing that gsh modulation of inos expression in hepatocytes is correlated with nf-kb activation, i.e., gsh depletion is associated with a lack of nf-kb activation. the influence of gsh depletion is not, however, consistent in all cell types. glucose induced reduction of gsh in intestinal epithelial cells is associated with nf-kb activation and upregulation of inos gene expression  <cit> .

it is also possible that cees decreases inos expression by interfering with the lps-induced activation of transcription factor nf-κb and/or signal transducer and activator of transcription-1α . it is interesting, therefore, that gray  <cit>  has found that both cees and hd inhibit the in vitro binding of transcription factor activating protein- <dig>  via alkylating the ap- <dig> dna consensus binding sequence rather than by direct damage to the ap- <dig> protein. furthermore, it is significant that neither cess nor its hydrolysis products were found to damage the ap- <dig> transcription factoring in a manner that prevented its dna binding  <cit> . similar experiments have yet to be done with nf-κb. chen et al.  <cit>  have also found that nitrogen mustard  methylamine) similarly inhibits the binding of ap- <dig> to its consensus sequence. nitrogen mustard also was shown to inhibit the binding of nf-κb to the gc-rich consensus sequence due to the interactions with dna  <cit> . it is possible, therefore, that cees also alkylates the nf-κb consensus sequence thereby preventing the binding of the nf-κb to the inos promoter. lps and/or cytokine-inducible nf-κb binding elements of the murine inos promoter have been identified  <cit> , and they are rich of guanine, which is the major alkylation site for hd or cees. the possible effect of cees on inos promoter regulation is currently being explored.

although the activation of nf-κb due to mustard or cees exposure have been shown in various cell lines  <cit> , the detailed mechanism of this event is still unclear. recent report  <cit>  showed that nf-κb-driven gene expression has maximum at  <dig> hours in hd treated keratinocytes. in contrast, in a guinea pig model, chatterjee et al.  <cit>  have shown that nf-κb activation in lung tissues occurs shortly after cees expose , then disappears within  <dig> hours completely. however, in our experiments we did not observe any short term stimulating effect of cees on no production or inos expression . notably, the electrophoretic mobility shift assays used by chatterjee et al. to measure nf-κb activation show only the state of nf-κb protein complex and provide no information regarding its binding to the dna consensus sequences.

the physiological significance of potentially decreased inos expression by exposure to cees or hd is not known. considerable evidence, however, supports the view that nitric oxide production via inos plays a key role in wound healing  <cit> . animal studies  <cit>  have shown that the inos knockout mice have impaired wound healing that is reversed by inos gene transfer. soneja et al.  <cit>  have suggested that wound healing could be accelerated under circumstances where oxidative stress is minimized and nitric oxide production enhanced. we have initiated work to explore the role of antioxidants in preventing hd induced pathology in skin.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that cees transiently inhibits no production in lps stimulated macrophages by inhibiting the expression of inos protein and not by modulating the enzymatic activity of inos. the decreased inos expression induced by cees suggests that this alkylating agent inhibits the lps stimulated activation of nf-κb and/or stat-1α transcription factors, and this possibility is being investigated. we cannot directly address the physiological significance of our in vitro results, however, both decreased expression of inos and decreased production of nitric oxide are associated with impaired wound healing  <cit> . it is likely that the cees or hd toxicity is modulated by a complex balance between nitric oxide production, thiol depletion and oxidative stress.
