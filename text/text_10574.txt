BACKGROUND
common carp  is naturally distributed across europe and asia. it was domesticated about  <dig>  years ago, and is cultured in over  <dig> countries worldwide with over  <dig> million metric tons of global annual production  <cit> . as a result of selection and breeding efforts over the past centuries, many domesticated strains have been established with distinct economic traits or phenotypes adapted to local environments and to meet consumer demands. china is the largest c. carpio producer, and there are abundant domesticated strains and populations in china, including sonpu mirror carp, hebao red carp, xingguo red carp, yellow river carp, and oujiang color carp, as well as many hybrid strains, all of which are the basis and genetic resources for selective breeding using modern genetic tools.

because of the economic importance of c. carpio for the global aquaculture industry, as well as its importance as a model species for ecology, physiology, and evolutionary studies, over the past decade, researchers have developed a variety of genetic and genomics tool and resources. a large number of genetic markers have been developed, including microsatellites  <cit> , and single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . a number of genetic linkage maps have been constructed based on these markers  <cit> . the markers have also been used to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with economically important traits including growth rate, body shape, and meat quality  <cit> . a large set of expressed sequence tags  have been generated using traditional cloning and sanger sequencing methods, or next-generation transcriptome sequencing, and a cdna microarray has been designed and constructed  <cit> . a bacterial artificial chromosome  library has been built  <cit> , a bac-based physical map has been constructed, and a large set of bac-end sequences  have been generated  <cit> . the complete mitochondrial genomes of several strains and populations have been sequenced  <cit> . whole genome exome data were generated for a comparative study with the danio rerio genome  <cit>  and, recently, the c. carpio genome consortium has completely sequenced and assembled a draft genome sequence of c. carpio <cit> .

a major gap in the c. carpio toolkit is the lack of a high-throughput snp genotyping platform for genetic research. such a platform is essential for whole genome association studies  of important traits, as well as for genome-assisted selection in breeding programs. genome-scale snp genotyping is most efficiently performed using snp arrays or chips. arrays of this type have been used widely in genetic studies in humans, as well as in important model organisms and agriculture species.

the reductions in the cost of acquiring sequence data using next-generation sequencing technologies has led to the development of genotyping by sequencing  approaches, which use whole genome sequencing, reduced representative genome sequencing, or target-enriched dna sequencing data to determine genotypes. the most popular gbs protocol is restriction-site-associated dna  tag sequencing in which dna fragments flanking particular restriction sites are targeted for sequencing, thereby allowing the discovery and genotyping of snps at these targeted locations  <cit> . although gbs methods have some advantages for genome-wide snp discovery and genotyping, especially for species for which a reference genome has not been established, they also have limitations, which include the requirements for complicated dna library preparation procedures and intensive bioinformatics pipelines. gbs is not suitable for genotyping the very large numbers of individuals or snp loci that are used commonly in gwas and genomic selection. in addition, gbs genotyping results are not shared easily among different research groups because the same snp loci are not assayed in all individuals.

therefore high-density snp genotyping arrays remain the tools of choice for high-resolution genetics analysis. many snp arrays or chips have been developed for either illumina or affymetrix platforms, including the human 500 k array, the genome-wide human snp array  <dig>  and  <dig> , the porcine 60 k snp array  <cit> , the bovine 50ksnp array  <cit> , the chicken 60 k  <cit>  and 600 k snp arrays  <cit> , the canine 22 k snp array  <cit> , and the equine 50 k snp array  <cit> . these arrays have been used widely for research on selective sweeps, phylogeny, population structure, copy number variations, gwas, and other aspects  <cit> , boosting genome and genetic studies as well as breeding programs of these species.

although the importance of high-density snp genotyping arrays has been recognized widely, as yet there are only a few such snp genotyping arrays for aquaculture species. after the submission of this manuscript, an affymetrix axiom® mydesign custom array containing  <dig>  atlantic salmon snps was developed  <cit> . meanwhile, an affymetrix axiom array containing  <dig>  putative catfish snps was also developed  <cit> . although a large research community is working on c. carpio and other closely related cyprinid species, and genotyping is performed intensively for diverse purposes, no snp genotyping array is available for c. carpio.

here, we report the design and validation of the first high-density c. carpio snp array, the carp snp array, based on the affymetrix axiom platform. the carp snp array was validated with  <dig>  samples from various c. carpio populations and strains. to assess its potential use in closely related cyprinids, we also validated the array in  <dig> individuals from eight related species. a pilot study was conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the genome-scale genotyping and linkage disequilibrium  decay was analyzed in all samples and in several domesticated strains. identity by state  clustering of all samples was conducted, which demonstrated the reliability of the carp snp array.

RESULTS
the pipeline and design parameters described below are summarized in figure  <dig> 

sequencing and alignment of sequence reads
in previous studies, over  <dig>  snps have been identified in transcript sequences and classified  <cit> . all these snps were mapped to the reference genome and assigned to genomic positions. however, because these snps are from transcribed sequences, their numbers are limited and represent only the snps in coding sequences. to improve on this situation, we selected  <dig> representative carps for genome re-sequencing, including seven accessions of two wild populations from the yellow and heilongjiang rivers, and  <dig> accessions of three domesticated strains . re-sequencing of these  <dig> accessions generated a total of  <dig>  million paired-end reads that were 101 bp long . all raw sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive . the short reads were mapped to the reference genome, with an average sequencing depth of six genome equivalent per animal. the mapping coverage rate was an average of  <dig> % .

snp identification
snp identification was performed separately within each strain. the criteria used for calling snps were as following:  mapping quality score ≥ 20;  relevant base quality score ≥ 20;  snp quality score ≥  <dig> and snp position must be covered by at least  <dig> reads; and  minor allele count  ≥  <dig> and minor allele frequency  ≥ 5%. a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps were identified in songpu carp,  <dig> , <dig> snps in yellow river carp,  <dig> , <dig> snps in heilongjiang river carp,  <dig> , <dig> snps in oujiang color carp, and  <dig> , <dig> snps in hebao carp . overall, a total of  <dig> , <dig> non-redundant snps were identified, of which  <dig>  were shared by all strains, and  <dig> , <dig> were strain-specific. together with the snps identified previously in the transcript sequences, we had a pool of  <dig> , <dig> snps from which to select snps for the carp array. an abundant source of candidate snps is essential for designing snp arrays, especially for large genomes like the c. carpio genome. when the dog snp array was developed, more than  <dig>  million potential snps were identified, with one snp per  <dig>  kb between breeds and one snp per  <dig>  kb within breeds. in other studies,  <dig>  million snps were detected in chicken  <cit> , and  <dig>  million snps were discovered in horse  <cit> . thus, based on these previous studies, it is evident that we had gathered a sufficient number of candidate snps to develop a c. carpio snp array.

snp reduction based on flanking sequence quality and close proximity
for quality control, 71-bp fragments spanning each snp were extracted, including 35-bp upstream and 35-bp downstream of the snp base. snps with flanking sequences that containing over four consecutive ‘g’ or ‘c’ or over six consecutive ‘a’ or ‘t’, and those containing ‘n’ were removed, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> snps. next, gc content was calculated and snps with flanking sequences with gc content below 30% or above 70% were removed. the flanking sequences of the remaining  <dig> , <dig> snps were mapped to the reference genome, and the  <dig> , <dig> snps that mapped uniquely were kept for further selection. snps located very close to each other are less likely to be assayed successfully during genotyping because of interference from neighboring variants. clustering of snps can be a result of the mis-alignment of reads because of the presence of the indels  at the beginning or end of reads  <cit> . based on advice from affymetrix scientists, we removed snps that were within 10 bp of each other or there were more than two variants within 35 bp. after these steps,  <dig> , <dig> snps remained in the final pool for selection. priority was given to snps in coding sequences, and then the genome re-sequencing snps were selected on the basis of their quality scores and spacing on the genome. finally, a total of  <dig>  snps were submitted for probe design.

snp reduction based on in-silico analysis of conversion values
the  <dig>  selected snps were submitted to affymetrix for in-silico analysis to predict their reproducibility on the axiom platform. the p -convert value, which is calculated using a random forest model, is designed to predict the probability that the snp will convert on the array. the random forest model considers many factors, such as probe sequence, binding energies, unexpected non-specific binding and probability of hybridization to multiple genomic regions  <cit> . p-convert values were generated for the forward and reverse probes and p-convert values ≥  <dig>  were considered to be qualified. as shown in figure  <dig>  a high proportion of the  <dig>  snps  had a p-convert value ≥  <dig> .

snp selection for the final carp array
in this final step, we selected  <dig>  snps in the following order:   <dig>  non-synonymous snps and  <dig>  snps in utr regions with each snp at least 100 bp from any adjacent snp;   <dig>  snps in transcribed sequences that were at least  <dig>  kb from any adjacent selected snp;   <dig>  snps from the genome re-sequencing data that were shared between strains and separated by at least 10 kb from any adjacent selected snp; and   <dig>  strain-specific snps that were at least 17 kb from any other snp on the array . as shown in figure  <dig>  the average interval between the final  <dig>  snps was  <dig>  kb, and the intervals between most snps ranged from  <dig> to 8 kb. when the snp densities on the assembled c. carpio chromosomes were calculated, we found that the snp densities ranged from  <dig> sites/mb to  <dig> sites/mb. scaffolds that have not been assigned to one of the  <dig> chromosomes were joined to form a pseudo ‘p’ chromosome, which had a snp density of  <dig> sites/mb . thus, the average number of snps per unit physical distance indicates that the snps are uniformly distributed across the genome.

evaluation of the snp array in c. carpio strains
after the carp array was manufactured, we evaluated the array in both c. carpio and related carp species. a total of  <dig>  c. carpio samples were collected from various strains, including songpu carp, hebao carp, yellow river carp, oujiang color carp, xingguo red carp, and heilongjiang carp. of the  <dig>  candidate snps,  <dig>   passed the manufacturing quality control and could be genotyped. with a stringent call rate threshold of 95%, there were  <dig>   polymorphic sites,  <dig>   sites with no minor homology genotype,  <dig>  monomorphic sites, and  <dig>   sites below the call rate threshold . although  <dig>   polymorphic snps had been validated in this study, it does not mean that only  <dig>  loci are polymorphic. more snp loci will be validated when more strains harboring a new genetic background are genotyped using this array. genotyping accuracies were estimated using samples from families and the results seemed to be satisfactory . of the <dig>  snps that passed the call rate threshold,  <dig> % had a maf >  <dig>  and  <dig> % had a maf >  <dig> , indicating that most of the snps will be applicable in subsequent research.

accuracy of genotyping for the snp array
high accuracy is a vital parameter for a genotyping platform. in this study, we assessed the genotyping accuracy of our carp array using data from a family comprising two parents and  <dig> offspring. plink software was applied with the ‘mendel’ parameter. any genotypes not concordant between parents and offspring were regarded as genotyping errors. we estimated the accuracy to be  <dig> % on average, and after excluding one sample because of multiple inconsistencies with the inheritance pattern expected on the basis of the declared pedigree, the genotyping accuracy increased to  <dig> % on average, showing the high genotyping quality of the carp array. thus, in subsequent research, this array will be of great importance in trait association analysis, qtl mapping, and marker assisted selection.

extensive assessment of the snp array in cyprinids
we evaluated the snp array in  <dig> samples from the c. carpio related species, such as carassius carassius, ctenopharyngodon idella, mylopharyngodon piceus, hypophthalmichthys molitrix, hypophthalmichthys nobilis, megalobrama amblycephala, danio rerio, leuciscus waleckii, and  <dig>   snps were found to be polymorphic. with a moderate call rate threshold of 80%, there were  <dig>   polymorphic sites,  <dig>   sites with no minor homology genotype,  <dig>  monomorphic sites, and  <dig>   sites below the call rate threshold . a detailed analysis of the eight cypridinae species is shown in table  <dig>  the number of snps that exhibited variations for each species ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , demonstrating that the snp array is potentially useful for studies of carp-related species. after filtering the snp call rate, the remaining number of snps range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among the eight species. the significant difference in the snp numbers before and after filtering is mainly because of the small sample sizes. from the eight cypridinae species, we collected  <dig> samples of d. rerio, five samples of l. waleckii, and  <dig> samples for other six species. in future research, as large numbers of samples are collected, more of the snps on the array may pass the call-rate threshold. among these eight species, d. rerio is the only species for which a genome assembly has been reported.

linkage disequilibrium  analysis
the extent of ld across the snps that are on the array was analyzed for all the samples of c. carpio and for three of the domesticated strains, yellow river carp, hebao carp, and xingguo red carp. pairwise r <dig> was calculated using  <dig>  snp markers with mafs over  <dig>  for  <dig>  samples for yellow river carp,  <dig>  for hebao carp, and  <dig>  for xingguo red carp. the average r <dig> within each kilo base pair was calculated and plotted against the physical distance . a similar trend of ld decay was observed in all samples and in each strain, showing that the ld blocks in c. carpio are shorter than most other species  <cit> . on the other hand, the ld blocks in these three strains are relatively longer than the ld blocks in all the samples tested, probably because of simpler genetic background within each strain. similar results have been reported in other species; for example, the domestic dog in which much longer ld blocks have been reported in each breed compared with in mixed samples  <cit> . in a future study, we will use larger samples of each strain for ld analysis and construct haplotypes, which will be useful for the design of medium or low density snp panels. as observed previously in several domesticated animals  <cit> , lower density snp panels can be designed and applied for genomic selection and breeding, with fewer tag markers selected on interesting traits.

population structure analysis through identity by state  clustering
population structure analyses have commonly been conducted before gwas analyses  <cit>  and several methods for population stratification have been developed, such as ibs and principle component analysis . in this study, genotyping was performed on  <dig>  samples of c. carpio and on  <dig> samples of another eight related species. after quality control  <dig>  markers and  <dig>  samples passed all the criteria. multidimensional scaling analysis of an ibs matrix revealed the substructure of the samples . all the samples were divided into three clusters. all the c. carpio samples  formed the largest cluster, within which different strains were grouped together. the oujiang color carp and heilongjiang carp genotyping results were both from the first 96-well plate of this array, so a replicate experiment should be performed along with the next batch of samples. c. carassius, d. rerio and l. waleckii formed the second cluster, close to the largest cluster. the third cluster consisted of c. idella, m. piceus, h. molitrix, h. nobilis and m. amblycephala and showed distinct divergences from the other two clusters. the ibs clustering results are consistent with several phylogenetic analyses of cyprinidae reported previously  <cit> , indicating that the carp snp array is reliable and potentially has applications in breeding.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed the carp snp array which is the first high-throughput genotyping platform for c. carpio. after evaluation with large samples, nearly three fourths of the designed  <dig>  snps proved to be polymorphic in c. carpio. besides, the carp snp array was also evaluated in related species. ld was calculated and longer haplotype blocks were observed in domesticated strains. ibs was conducted and most of the samples were assigned to different clusters. this study indicates that the carp snp array will be valuable for farmed carp and for genetic and population biology studies in c. carpio and related species.
