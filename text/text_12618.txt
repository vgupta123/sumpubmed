BACKGROUND
plants are an advantageous system for the cost-effective expression of large amounts of safe complex recombinant proteins. in particular, it has been extensively demonstrated that plants are ideal bioreactors to classical heterologous protein expression systems for the production of functional monoclonal antibodies, enzymes and vaccine components  <cit> . the major advantages of plants over traditional expression systems based on bacterial and mammalian cells are a reduced risk of contamination by human pathogens and low costs, especially for large-scale production  <cit> . in recent years, it has been demonstrated that both structural and regulatory proteins of hiv or related viruses can be successfully expressed in plants by either stable transformation  or transient expression systems   <cit> . different structural hiv proteins have been successfully expressed in transgenic plants including pr55gag, gag p <dig> and p24/p <dig>  <cit> . the non-structural hiv- <dig> accessory protein nef is considered a good candidate for the formulation of vaccines that combine both structural and functional viral components. in fact, during the viral life cycle, nef is expressed early and is essential to both viral load and disease progression. moreover, nef genes are highly conserved in all primate lentiviruses  and data show that patients classified as long-term non-progressors bear alterations in the nef gene  <cit> . encouraging studies on the production of hiv vaccines containing nef have been recently published. a clinical evaluation of a multi-component vaccine containing recombinant gp <dig> and nef-tat fusion proteins was performed in uninfected human volunteers  <cit> . moreover, the effects of a genetic vaccine combining both structural  and regulatory  viral proteins were evaluated in the siv-macaca animal model  <cit> .

nef has been already produced in transgenic plants  using different expression strategies and different signal or fusion peptides to direct the expression of the viral protein either to the cytosol or secretory pathway. the most successful strategies were those in which nef was fused to stabilizing proteins as the chimeric protein zeolin or the hiv p <dig> antigen  <cit> . in particular, nef fused to p <dig> yielded the highest levels of recombinant protein in transplantomic plants )  <cit> . on the other hand, the expression of nef alone in plant cells proved to be very difficult and the most promising results were obtained expressing a mutated form of nef in which the n-terminal myristoyl-acceptor glycine  was mutated to alanine . this non-myristoylated derivative accumulated up to  <dig> % tsp in the cytosol of transgenic nicotiana tabacum   <cit> . indeed, it was previously shown that recombinant nef lacking myristoylation was able to elicit an enhanced cellular immunity compared to its wild-type counterpart, representing an ideal candidate for the formulation of multicomponent vaccines  <cit> .

in order to investigate novel trategies to enhance nef p <dig> mut yield, a transient expression system based on leaf agroinfiltration of nicotiana benthamiana  plants has been devised. transient expression systems rely either on the epichromosomal expression of agrobacterium tumefaciens  directly infiltrated into plant tissues  or on viral-based expression vectors. both systems generally offer several advantages over the generation of transgenic plants, including production speed and high expression yields. among transient expression strategies, agroinfiltration system has been used to accumulate high levels of different heterologous proteins, ranging from reporter genes   <cit>  to complex multimeric molecules, such as immunoglobulins  <cit> . main advantages of this system consist in the possibility of expressing long gene sequences, flexibility and ease of expressing more than one gene simultaneously in the same cell, allowing efficient assembly of multimeric proteins. moreover, this system could be easily applied to industrial scale for massive production of recombinant proteins. a major drawback of this technology is that expression levels of heterologous proteins are generally limited by the post-transcriptional gene silencing  response that may take place in the infiltrated plant tissue  <cit> . to overcome this limitation, the use of viral suppressors of gene silencing in the agroinfiltration assays was able to prevent ptgs and enhance transient expression levels of heterologous proteins. this was clearly confirmed in n. benthamiana using the p <dig> suppressor of gene silencing of tomato bushy stunt virus , which was able to enhance expression yields of a range of proteins up to  <dig> folds  <cit> .

in this work we describe the transient expression of nef p <dig> mut  <cit>   in n. benthamiana, using a vacuum-agroinfiltration system. to enhance expression levels, the co-agroinfiltration of nef in combination with three different viral suppressors of gene silencing  was evaluated. results demonstrated that amcv-p <dig> gave the highest nef yields with an almost three-fold increase compared to those previously reported in stable transgenic plants. the effect of these three different viral proteins on nef accumulation in leaves at different positions on the plant  was also assessed. moreover, an optimised nef purification protocol, based on a two-step immobilized-metal affinity chromatography  was also performed.

RESULTS
cloning of the amcv-p <dig> gene silencing suppressor
amcv viral cdna was retrotranscribed from genomic rna extracted from purified virus particles as previously described  <cit> . the amcv-p <dig> gene was amplified from viral cdna by polymerase chain reaction , using specific primers flanking the p <dig> coding region  <cit> . the unique amplified product was cloned into the pbi-Î© plant expression vector under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter and the nopaline synthase  terminator sequence  <cit> . to enhance translational efficiency, the tobacco mosaic virus  5'-untranslated leader sequence  was fused in frame with the heterologous gene . the p35:amcv-p <dig> and p35:nef constructs  were electroporated into a. tumefaciens strain lba <dig> and used in co-agroinfiltration experiments.

nef transient expression
six weeks old n. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with the a. tumefaciens clone harbouring nef alone or with mixed cultures of agrobacterium carrying p35:nef and p35:amcv-p <dig> , p35:tbsv-p <dig>  or p35:pvx-p <dig>  expression cassettes. in order to determine the peak of nef expression in the agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana plants, leaf samples were collected from three independent plants on  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days post infiltration  . nef expression levels were assayed by direct elisa and the results of these experiments showed that the highest expression levels using gene silencing suppressors were reached at  <dig> d.p.i. in all samples . based on this preliminary results we set up a vacuum-agroinfiltration transient expression experiment in order to evaluate and compare the effect of the different gene silencing suppressors as well as the influence of leaf age/position on nef yield. three plants per construct were agroinfiltrated at the six-leaf stage and at  <dig> d.p.i. leaves at three different positions, corresponding to the first node counting from the top , the third , and the fifth node , were collected. plant extracts have been analysed by elisa and data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance . as expected, co-agroinfiltration with the three viral suppressors of gene silencing enhanced nef expression levels . moreover, the comparison among gene silencing suppressors, revealed that amcv-p <dig> produced the highest nef yield with a mean value of  <dig> % tsp  representing a  <dig>  fold increase compared to nef alone. the differences observed in nef expression levels using amcv-p <dig>  tbsv-p <dig> or pvx-p <dig> resulted statistically significant . n. benthamiana plants co-agroinfiltrated with nef/amcv-p <dig> showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold increase in nef yield compared to plants co-agroinfiltrated with nef/tbsv-p <dig> and nef/pvx-p <dig>  respectively. most interestingly, expression yield analysis performed on leaves at different positions, demonstrated a statistically significant decrease  of nef expression levels in top  leaves compared to middle/bottom leaves in all constructs . furthermore, no statistically significant  difference in nef expression yield was evidenced between the three replica plants used in this study for all constructs .

suppression of local rna silencing by amcv-p19
to verify the correlation between amcv-p <dig> expression and the accumulation levels of nef specific sirnas, n. benthamiana leaves were either infiltrated with an agrobacterium suspension carrying nef gene alone or with mixed cultures of agrobacterium carrying p35:nef  and p35:amcv-p <dig>  or p35:tbsv-p <dig>  expression cassettes. leaf samples were collected at  <dig> d.p.i. and analysed by elisa and northern blot. the expression of amcv or tbsv-p <dig> gene silencing suppressors in the plant extracts was assayed by elisa, using a polyclonal antibody to tbsv-p <dig>  demonstrating an accumulation in agroinfiltrated leaves. moreover, total rna from the same samples was extracted and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and analysed by northern blot using a sense rna probe  corresponding to the nef gene. as shown in figure 4b, nef specific sirnas  accumulated only in the leaves infiltrated with agrobacterium carrying nef gene alone while sirnas were not detected in the nef/amcv-p <dig> or nef/tbsv-p <dig> co-agroinfiltrated leaves . these results demonstrated that p <dig> expression in the agroinfiltrated tissue significantly reduced the accumulation of silencing-associated nef specific sirnas.

two-step purification of plant-derived nef
in order to optimize the purification protocol of plant expressed nef fused to a hexa-histidine tag   <cit> , a two step imac experimental procedure was set up using both a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid  and cobalt affinity purification columns. plant extracts were prepared from  <dig> g of both transgenic n. tabacum plant leaves  expressing nef  <cit>  and n. benthamiana fresh leaves agroinfiltrated with nef/amcv-p <dig>  nef purification was performed in parallel from both extracts using the same protocol. as negative controls, untransformed  n. tabacum and non-infiltrated n. benthamiana plants were used. the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation, supernatants were loaded onto a ni-nta column and the eluted fractions containing nef were then passed through a desalting column for buffer exchange. samples derived from the first purification step were further separated through a cobalt affinity purification column and the eluted fractions were analysed by western blot . the results clearly showed a strong increase of purified nef yield  in all four elution fractions from agroinfiltrated samples  compared to those from transgenic leaves .

in two elution fractions  obtained after purification from agroinfiltrated leaves, high molecular weight bands were also observed   probably due to the ability of nef core to form dimers and trimers, as previously reported  <cit> . on the contrary, the formation of nef multimers was not observed in transgenic plants probably due to the extremely low expression yields reported in this system. purified plant-derived nef has an additional flag-histidine tag fused at its c-terminus and, therefore, showed a higher molecular weight compared to the bacterially-derived nef used as a positive control  <cit> . purified nef from agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves revealed the presence of two distinct bands indicated by asterisks in figure 5c. the upper band corresponded to intact plant-purified nef, while the lower band proved to be a degradation product, as indicated by mass spectrometry  . the amount of purified nef from both transgenic tobacco and agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves was estimated by densitometric analysis of the bands obtained in western-blot using the image j v.  <dig> b software. a standard curve was obtained from the band densities of three different dilutions  of bacterially-derived nef . calculated average purification yields were of  <dig> and  <dig> ng per gram of fresh transgenic and agroinfiltrated leaves, respectively.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have previously shown that hiv- <dig> nef protein lacking the myristoylation signal can be successfully expressed in the cytosol of transgenic tobacco plants accumulating up to  <dig> % tsp  <cit> . data on nef plant expression using different approaches, all based on stable transformation, have been reported  <cit>  showing that the highest yields  were generally obtained by fusing nef to stabilizing protein components  <cit> . however, efficient extraction and purification of the antigen expressed as a fusion protein, still represents a major issue.

in our work we focused our efforts to enhance the production of nef  in the cytoplasm of plant cells. to our knowledge, no attempt of transiently expressing nef as a single gene has been reported in literature until now. therefore, with the aim of increasing the expression levels of plant-produced nef, we assayed an efficient vacuum-agroinfiltration system in n. benthamiana boosted by different viral suppressors of gene silencing . previous works already showed that the use of p <dig> derived from tbsv enhanced expression levels of different proteins in n. benthamiana up to  <dig> fold  <cit> . in this work we performed a quantitative detailed analysis to evaluate and compare the effect of different gene silencing suppressors as well as the influence of leaf position on yield of the foreign protein. the results illustrated herein, demonstrated that leaves co-agroinfiltrated with nef and amcv-p <dig> gave the highest yield . this represented a  <dig>  fold increase of nef expression levels compared to plants infiltrated without amcv-p <dig>  while a  <dig> and  <dig>  fold increase was observed in the case of tbsv-p <dig> and pvx-p <dig>  respectively. the significant difference in expression yield between amcv-p <dig> and tbsv-p <dig> is somehow unexpected considering their high aminoacid sequence homology . moreover, we observed that nef expression level using both amcv and tbsv-p <dig> proteins was substantially higher compared to that obtained with pvx-p <dig>  in accordance to previously reported data  <cit> . furthermore, no significant synergic effects in enhancing the expression levels were detected by co-infiltrating plants with a combination of recombinant agrobacterium strains carrying either amcv-p19/pvx-p <dig> or tbsv-p19/pvx-p <dig> . this could be explained in light of what observed in sirna detection experiments in which both p <dig> proteins totally hampered the accumulation of nef specific sirnas.

expression analysis performed on leaves at different positions, demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of nef expression levels in top leaves compared to middle/bottom leaves for all costructs. these data are in contrast with what has been observed in transgenic plants expressing antibodies in which top leaves generally showed the highest expression levels  <cit> . this behaviour is probably due to the higher protein degradation rate occurring in mature leaves. it is conceivable that degradation processes may have scarce influence in transient expression systems, as the time frame of recombinant proteins expression is limited to just  <dig> days before harvesting. therefore, the lower expression level observed in top leaves is an important issue to consider when using transient agroinfiltration systems for recombinant protein production.

in this work we demonstrated that protein yield obtained by transient expression of nef alone in n. benthamiana was lower  compared to what previously reported in n. tabacum transgenic plants   <cit> . a direct comparison of nef accumulation levels in agroinfiltrated leaves using a viral suppressor of gene silencing and transgenic plants cannot be made, nevertheless, we showed that transient expression using amcv-p <dig> is an advantageous system for rapid and high yield production of nef. furthermore, a two-step imac protocol was used to optimize nef purification from both agroinfiltrated and transgenic plant leaves. an eight-fold increase of purification yield from agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana  with respect to transgenic tobacco  was observed. this striking difference was somehow unexpected considering that the calculated nef expression yield in agroinfiltrated plants resulted only about three times higher than in transgenics. a possible explanation could be that different plant species  were utilised for purification, and in the case of n. benthamiana extracts, nef showed a diminished tendency to aggregate and precipitate in the insoluble protein fraction. in fact, during extraction and purification a consistent part of the protein  was lost due to aggregation and precipitation phenomena.

taken together, the results presented here suggest that the use of viral suppressor of gene silencing, amcv-p <dig>  could efficiently enhance the transient expression of recombinant proteins in n. benthamiana. moreover, this transient expression system provides the advantage of higher production speed over the generation of transgenic plants.
