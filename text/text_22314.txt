BACKGROUND
gabaa receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate phasic and tonic inhibition in the central nervous system  <cit> . when activated by gaba the integral ion channel opens, rendering the receptor permeable to chloride ions. the co-assembly of combinations of  <dig> different subunits  into homo- or hetero-pentameric receptors results in multiple different gabaa receptor isoforms with different function, pharmacology and neuronal location  <cit> . the stoichiometry of the majority of these receptors is considered to be 2α:2β:1γ/δ, predominantly arranged as β-α-β-α-γ/δ in an anticlockwise manner when viewed from the extracellular space  <cit> . however, the arrangement for δ subunit-containing receptors seems to be dependent on the experimental conditions  <cit> .

receptors incorporating α <dig>  α <dig> or α <dig> subunits most commonly assemble with β and γ subunits, and are generally located at the synapse where they mediate phasic inhibition; whereas α <dig> and α6-containing receptors assemble with β and δ subunits, and are found extrasynaptically, mediating tonic inhibition  <cit> . the δ subunit is found almost exclusively in the extrasynaptic domain and forms α4βδ or α6βδ receptors in the cortex and cerebellum, respectively  <cit> . however, it has also been suggested that δ can co-assemble with α <dig> subunits in hippocampal interneurons  <cit> .

the existence of α4β2/3δ receptors in brain regions such as the hippocampal dentate gyrus is well established, but there is a paucity of data which characterises the potential native expression of the α4β1δ receptor  <cit> . this is largely due to the limited number of β1-subtype-selective compounds available  <cit> , and the fact that no β <dig> subunit knock-out mouse has been generated. as a consequence, most previous studies investigating α4βδ receptors have focused on those subtypes containing the β <dig> or β <dig> subunits as these are confirmed to be native receptor combinations  <cit> . however, co-regulation of the expression levels of α <dig>  β <dig> and δ subunits in, for example, the periaqueductal grey matter throughout the female oestrous cycle has been reported, suggesting that α4β1δ receptors may perform a hitherto overlooked important physiological role  <cit> . also, experimental evidence for the co-expression of α <dig>  β <dig> and δ subunits at extrasynaptic sites exists for pyramidal hippocampal neurons  <cit> . furthermore, recent studies have emphasized the importance of β1-containing receptors in relation to sleep control  <cit>  and ataxia  <cit> , and polymorphic mutants of the β <dig> subunit are thought to be important in determining the extent of alcohol consumption  <cit> . therefore, since α <dig>  β <dig> and δ subunits are co-expressed in several brain regions  <cit> , the possibility exists that these subunits can co-assemble into native functional receptors, most likely at extrasynaptic sites, raising the prospect that such a receptor subtype may be important for neuronal physiology.

few studies have investigated the properties of either human  <cit>  or murine  <cit>  recombinant α4β1δ receptors, and none of these have fully addressed the characterisation of classic gabaa receptor ligands. in these studies, interesting pharmacological differences between murine and human α4β1δ receptors are manifest: human receptors expressed in xenopus oocytes  <cit>  are constitutively active and display a gaba ec <dig> in the mid-nanomolar range whereas the rat/mouse receptor expressed in oocytes or hek <dig> cells display low-micromolar sensitivity towards activation by gaba  <cit> . to address this apparent species-dependent pharmacology and to address the effects of commonly used gaba receptor ligands, we report the pharmacological profiles for several gabaa receptor ligands at recombinant murine α4β <dig> and α4β1δ receptors expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes.

RESULTS
gaba concentration response relationships for α4β <dig> and α4β1δ receptors
gaba concentration response curves were generated for α4β <dig> and α4β1δ receptors to evaluate gaba potency at these receptors. oocytes were challenged with increasing concentrations of gaba . depending upon expression levels, maximal currents to gaba ranged from  <dig> to 3000 na for cells expressing α4β <dig> receptors and from  <dig> to 3000 na for cells expressing α4β1δ receptors. the holding currents were between  <dig> and -40 na and the receptors were not constitutively active. the gaba ec <dig> values were  <dig>  μm for α4β1δ receptors and  <dig>  μm for α4β <dig> receptors . gaba concentration-response data were fitted as monophasic curves, with hill coefficients of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for α4β1δ and α4β <dig> receptors, respectively .figure  <dig>

inhibition of gaba responses by divalent cations
zn2+ has been shown to be a useful pharmacological tool to distinguish αβ receptors from αβδ/γ receptors in recombinant expression systems, as δ/γ subunit-containing gabaa receptors are less sensitive to inhibition by zn2+ compared to their αβ counterparts  <cit> . the increased potency at αβ receptors is attributed to the incorporation of a third β subunit that contains an important histidine residue for coordinating zn2+ ions at the top of channel lining m <dig> region  <cit> .

we evaluated zn2+-inhibition of the gaba response for both α4β <dig> and α4β1δ receptor isoforms to investigate whether zn2+ can distinguish between these receptor subtypes. oocytes were pre-incubated for 1 min with various concentrations of zn2+ followed by co-application of zn2+ and gaba at an ec <dig> . as expected, zn2+ exhibited a higher potency at α4β <dig> than α4β1δ receptors. for α4β1δ receptors, zn2+ inhibited the gaba response with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm . by contrast, for α4β <dig> receptors, biphasic inhibitory behaviour was observed with a high potency component  accounting for ~25% of the total inhibition, and a more dominant lower potency component  accounting for the remaining  inhibition .figure  <dig>

cu2+ is another well-established inhibitor of gaba currents at γ subunit-containing gabaa receptors  <cit> , but its inhibitory profile at δ subunit-containing receptors has only recently been explored  <cit> . this revealed that cu2+ was far more potent as an inhibitor of steady-state gaba responses at α6β3δ receptors  compared to α1β2γ <dig> receptors  expressed in human embryonic kidney  <dig>  cells  <cit> . to further investigate the inhibitory selectivity of cu2+ at α4β1δ receptors, we co-applied increasing concentrations of cu2+ with gaba  for 70 s, and measured the steady-state responses, reproducing the experimental conditions used by mcgee et al.  <cit>  to determine the ic <dig> values. this response was taken as the fraction of the peak response of a previously-applied gaba concentration, and normalized to the steady-state response of gaba ec <dig> in the absence cu2+ . an almost complete inhibition of the α4β1δ gaba-activated response was observed with increasing concentrations of cu2+  .

inhibition by the β <dig> subunit-selective blocker scs
the salicylic acid derivative, scs, is one of only a few compounds known to selectively target β <dig> subunit-containing gabaa receptors over β2- and β3-containing receptors  <cit> . scs is reported to inhibit gaba-activated responses of α2β1γ <dig>  α2β1γ <dig> and α2β1γ1θ receptors, but the pharmacological profile of scs at α <dig> or δ-containing receptors, has not been addressed. to examine the interaction of scs with α4β1δ receptors, we evaluated the inhibition of the gaba ec <dig> response following pre-application of the antagonist. in this instance, a low ec <dig> concentration was chosen to enable a direct comparison between our study and that obtained previously  <cit> . scs inhibited the gaba response with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm, but did not cause complete inhibition of the gaba current, attaining a steady-state level of inhibition at  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of control .

neurosteroid potentiation at α4β1δ receptors
neurosteroids are potent modulators at most, if not all, gabaa receptor isoforms  <cit> . some studies report that neurosteroids are more potent at recombinant δ subunit-containing receptors compared to their γ subunit-containing counterparts  <cit> . accordingly, we evaluated the sensitivity of α4β1δ receptors to neurosteroid-induced potentiation. increasing concentrations of thdoc were co-applied with an approximately ec <dig> gaba concentration. a significant increase in the gaba peak-response was recorded with thdoc concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> nm  with dunnett’s post test, figure 2f).

discussion
in this study we investigated the pharmacological profiles of several gabaa receptor ligands at murine α4β1δ receptors. the gaba potency of  <dig>  μm  at α4β1δ receptors determined in this study is similar to that previously reported for the rat receptor  expressed in xenopus oocytes  <cit> , and the mouse/rat receptor  expressed in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . however, a much higher gaba potency  has been reported for the human α4β1δ receptor expressed in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . the gaba potency for human α4β <dig>  is reported to be somewhat lower  <cit>  than the murine combination studied here. furthermore, constitutive activity in the absence of gaba was reported for the human recombinant α4β1δ receptor  <cit> , but this was not evident in our studies with the murine equivalent. from these observations it is possible that differences in constitutive activity may explain the considerable differences in gaba potency reported between species observed by others and in this study. however, several other factors may also influence the observed potency shift, such as differences in relative subunit expression levels which may significantly impact on the final receptor stoichiometry. in particular, δ-containing receptors are prone to such variations in stoichiometry. this is evident from studies in which variations in the amount of rna injected into xenopus oocytes apparently yield different receptor populations  <cit> ; likewise, concatemeric receptors also demonstrate that alternative assemblies of functional δ-containing receptors are possible  <cit> ; and from reports that both high and low affinity conformations of the related α4β3δ receptor apparently exist  <cit> .

in this study we report the first characterisation of specific gaba antagonists at α4β1δ receptors. the approximately 60-fold potency shift in the ic <dig> values for zn2+ from low micromolar to mid nanomolar, when comparing α4β1δ and α4β <dig>  is consistent with prior observations made for α4β3δ and α4β <dig> receptors  <cit> . our determination of monophasic zn2+ potency suggests it is highly unlikely that there is any contamination with binary α4β <dig> receptors in our α4β1δ-expressing oocytes. also, the inability of zn2+ to inhibit the response below the holding current baseline corroborates the absence of any constitutive activity caused by homomeric β <dig> receptors  <cit> .

it has previously been suggested that the stoichiometry of binary gabaa receptors containing only α and β subunits is dependent on the type of α and β subunit present, with a 3α:2β stoichiometry predominating for α1β <dig> receptors, but a 2α:3β stoichiometry preferred for α4β <dig> receptors  <cit> . the biphasic inhibitory behaviour of zn2+ in our study would suggest the presence of a mixed gabaa receptor population, perhaps with both 3α:2β and 2α:3β stoichiometries expressed in the oocyte. this conclusion is rationalized by the fact that an additional β subunit will contribute another h <dig> residue, known to be critical for zn2+ inhibition  <cit> , which may underpin the higher sensitivity component to zn2+ in the biphasic inhibition curves.

this study also evaluated the pharmacology of additional compounds at α4β1δ known to interact with gabaa receptors. we have established that the pharmacological profile of the β1-selective inhibitor scs, at α4β1δ receptors, is in agreement with the values reported for α2β1γ <dig> receptors when expressed in xenopus oocytes  than at α6β3δ receptors  where the maximal inhibition of the steady-state response was reported to be ~ 68%  <cit> . although this difference may conceivably be due to the different expression systems, it is equally likely that it reflects some subunit-selectivity  for cu2+.

as hypothesized, thdoc concentrations at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm were able to potentiate low  gaba concentrations, suggesting that α4β1δ receptors are likely to be modulated by physiologically relevant concentrations of neurosteroids, as akin to many other gabaa receptor subtypes  <cit> . this is unsurprising given that the highly conserved neurosteroid binding site for potentiating gaba responses is contained within the receptor α subunit.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have extended the pharmacological profile of the α4β1δ receptor, a subtype that has been studied surprisingly little compared to its β2- and β3-containing counterparts, despite its presence in many significant brain areas. we report a high gaba potency , a weaker sensitivity to zn2+ compared to α4β <dig> receptors, and a high sensitivity to scs and thdoc.

the observed discrepancy in potency compared to the human ortholog highlights the need for caution when making comparisons of pharmacological parameters across species for this particular gaba receptor subtype. for example, in addition to the different gaba potencies, there are notable differences in constitutive activity for this receptor isoform. whether these differences translate into the native behaviour of this receptor remains to be determined. finally, the different expression pattern of the β <dig> subunit compared to β <dig> and β <dig> subunits  <cit>  suggests that β1-containing subtypes may offer novel therapeutic targets and opportunities, and emphasizes a greater need for subtype-selective ligands and/or genetically modified mice to better understand the native function and pharmacology of this gabaa receptor isoform. indeed recent findings suggest a clinically relevant role for β1-containing extrasynaptic gabaa receptors in the nucleus accumbens mediating addictive behaviours related to excessive alcohol intake  <cit> .
