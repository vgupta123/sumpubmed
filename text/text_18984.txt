BACKGROUND
the who considers leishmaniasis as one of the six most important tropical diseases worldwide  <cit> . it is caused by parasites of the genus leishmania that are passed to humans and animals by sandflies of the subfamily phlebotominae  <cit> . leishmaniasis, which is endemic in  <dig> countries, has an annual incidence of two million cases and is estimated to cause over  <dig>  deaths per year  <cit> . the disease has three main forms: cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis. visceral leishmaniasis, the most severe form of the disease, is also known as "kala azar", "black fever" or "dumdum fever". it especially affects hosts with weak immune systems, such as children or adults suffering from malnutrition or hiv. the human immune response that limits leishmaniasis is mediated by th <dig> cells that activate macrophages to kill the parasite . when cellular immunity is deficient, an expansion of th <dig> cells occurs which allows the parasite to survive within the monocytes and fosters disease development  <cit> . after an incubation period that varies from ten days to two years  <cit> , typical symptoms are fever, diarrhea, body weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. despite all of the current research, there is still a lack of understanding about the metabolism of the parasite and disease progression.

mathematical modeling of the processes involved in parasite-host interactions has become a necessary tool in the study of diseases, leishmaniasis being no exception. a significant part of the modeling work in this field is epidemiological  <cit> . in addition, models have also been used to study regulation of gene expression, protein synthesis, and metabolism of the parasite at the genome-wide level  <cit> . the dynamics of parasite-host interactions in the infection process has also been studied using agent-based modeling approaches  <cit> . for example, dancik et al.  <cit>  used an agent-based stochastic model of the immune response of mice to l. major infection to identify parameters that are important in changing the dynamics of the infection process, and to quantify the influence of those parameters. the authors showed that increasing parasite growth rate decreases pathogen load in some circumstances.

there are many studies regarding the biology, epidemiology and immunology of leishmaniasis  <cit> , yet there are fewer studies related to the evolution of the infection in animal models. a significant reference for the latter is the work of courret et al.  <cit>  where lesion development, cellular response, expression of cytokines, as well as parasite load in the spleen of balb/c mice infected with l. amazonensis is described. in this vein there are also the works of arrais-silva et al.  <cit>  on the hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig> from l. amazonensis infection; of lira et al.  <cit>  on balb/c mice symptoms, parasite load and immune response in c57bl/ <dig> mice infected with l. major; and the work of requena et al.  <cit>  and of dea-ayuela et al.  <cit>  that explores the clinical symptoms, parasite loads and antibody levels in susceptible, oligosymptomatic and resistant hamsters. the study of requena et al.  <cit>  compared these parameters together with lymphocyte population and proliferation, in two groups infected with different amounts of parasites and a control group.

in the present work we adopted a systems biology approach for understanding disease evolution, host-pathogen interactions, and immune response function. we performed this task by using experimental time series measurements in balb/c mice infected with l. amazonensis to parameterize a mathematical model that accounts for immune response and parasite load. based on this model we were able to quantify the biological interrelations between variables, perform predictive simulations, carry out sensitivity analysis to evaluate the significance of the system parameters, and solve an optimization problem for minimizing the parasite load. this analysis contributes valuable information to the drug discovery pipeline for developing effective therapeutic methods against leishmaniasis.

RESULTS
mathematical model
experimental measurements obtained in balb/c mice were used to fit the parameters of the mathematical model shown in figure  <dig> that accounts for the progression of leishmaniasis . in the present work we used a general power-law formulation, the general mass action power law formalism  that allows for non-integer kinetic orders  <cit>  with the following structure:

  vi=dxidt= ∑jσijγj ∏kxkgjk 

in the above expression, xi, σij, γj and gjk represent the normalized variable set, the stoichiometric matrix, the rate constants, and the kinetic orders, respectively. the variables lymphocytes proliferation , igg <dig>  and igg2a  were normalized with respect to the respective value in the control group of mice. because the control group is parasite-free, the same approach could not be used to normalize parasite load. in this case the variable was normalized with respect to its own mean value. this standardization reduces the range of variation of the parameters and computation time, and also exploits various properties of the gma-pl formalism on the behavior of variables and parameters. the specific numerical values for the parameters σij, γj and gjk are determined using prior biological knowledge, information about the basal steady-states of the system  <cit> , and/or dynamical experimental data  <cit> . in power-law models, kinetic orders can have non-integer values. one of the main advantages of power-law models is that they allow for the condensation of several steps into simplified representations  <cit> . the parameters of the model are kinetic orders and rate constants. negative values for the kinetic order represent inhibition, that is, an increase in its variable leads to a diminution of the rate involved, while a zero indicates that the variable does not affect the described process. when positive values are considered for a kinetic order, several alternatives are possible: values between zero and one imply a flux that depends on the variable in a saturating-like manner. values equal to one imply a flux that depends linearly on the variable or, in chemical terms, a first order reaction. by allowing non-integer, positive or negative, kinetic orders, we are able to consider a larger class of kinetic models from which we can select a suitable candidate without changing the  model structure.

the total parasite load in the host  stimulates its immune response. the parasites multiply in macrophages by binary division. the parasite load growth  has a nonlinear dependence on the parasite load through the kinetic order g <dig>  increased parasite load leads to a decrease in the proliferation rate of lymphocytes ; this interaction is represented by the kinetic order g <dig>  <cit> . proliferation  of t lymphocytes  occurs when naïve t cells are activated by antigens of the pathogen  and then differentiated into effector cells  and memory cells. the activation of lymphocytes is an essential event in the production of specific immune responses  against pathogens. proliferation was measured following the protocol by monks et al.  <cit>  using the stimulation index . the lymphocyte proliferation v <dig> is also stimulated by x <dig>  through g <dig>  cell mediated effectors enhance x <dig> decay ; this effect is represented by the positive kinetic order g <dig>  <cit> .

the host immune system produces igg <dig>  and igg2a  antibodies which could be linked to the th <dig> and th <dig> mechanisms respectively  <cit> . this is represented in our model through a positive influence of x <dig> on the rate synthesis of igg <dig>  through g <dig>  and on the rate synthesis of igg2a  through g <dig>  these two immunoglobulins are antagonistic, so each of them has a negative influence on the generation rate of the other, namely x <dig> on v <dig> and x <dig> on v <dig>  these effects are represented by the kinetic orders g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the igg2a influences macrophage activity by stimulating the x <dig> rate decay, v <dig>  this interaction is represented in our model by the positive kinetic order g <dig>  it is assumed that the transformation rates v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig> and v <dig> are proportional to x <dig>  x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig>  these dependences are represented in the model by the positive kinetic orders g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively.

given that every variable has an influx and an outflow, the stoichiometric coefficients are  <dig> and - <dig> for the synthesis and transformation processes respectively. model parameters were determined by fitting the model to experimental data from mice using a genetic algorithm as described in the methods section.

accordingly, the power law model derived from the above scheme is given by:

  dx1dt= <dig> ⋅x <dig> - <dig> ⋅x1⋅x <dig> ⋅x <dig> dx2dt= <dig> ⋅x <dig> ⋅x <dig> - <dig> ⋅x <dig> ⋅x2dx3dt= <dig> ⋅x <dig> ⋅x4- <dig> - <dig> ⋅x3dx4dt= <dig> ⋅x <dig> ⋅x3- <dig> - <dig> ⋅x <dig> 

model validation
we validated the model by using it to make predictions about the way the system would behave under initial parasite loads that were different from those used to calculate parameter models . we then performed the corresponding experiments in vivo , measuring the four variables described by the model and comparing their observed behavior to model predictions. this initial number of parasites  was chosen to check the model capacity to correctly describe the behavior in extreme and differing conditions of initial parasite load. since the model's main purpose is for the design of therapeutic strategies, a model able to describe a wide range of parasite load dynamics is of foremost interest. figure  <dig> shows the results obtained. there it can be seen that the deviation of model prediction from the experimental data is reasonably good during the initial  <dig> weeks after infection  with a parasite load of  <dig>  since the model describes the evolution over the first  <dig> weeks after infection, the observed discrepancies in the two experimental conditions considered  can be deemed as reasonable in light of the associated experimental error. in this regard, we want to stress the fact that in the experimental data used for model verification, other elements of the immune system may be playing a significant role not addressed by the model, but which could be relevant in conditions of massive infection.

sensitivity analysis
in general, the higher sensitivities correspond to the variable indicated by the arrow, except for the parameters directly influencing lymphocyte proliferation . for the parasite load, sensitivities with absolute values greater than  <dig> are sγ1x <dig> and sg1x. this implies that the generation rate of parasites, and the effect of parasites on their own generation, strongly influence parasite load. sensitivity sγ2x <dig> is much lower than sγ1x <dig>  all the other parameters yield sensitivities with absolute values of less than  <dig>  for parasite load. the sensitivity of igg <dig> and igg2a to most of the parameters is higher than the sensitivity of lymphocyte proliferation or parasite load to the same parameters. this could be a consequence of the fact that most of the values for parameters directly influencing the parasite load  are small , as opposed to those directly influencing lymphocyte proliferation.

systematic search of parameter profiles for the minimization of parasite load
in order to apply the model for therapeutic purposes, we carried out a systematic search of parameter values that minimize the parasite load. the aim was to discover the set of parameter values  that yields a reduced, minimum value of the parasite load, both during the time of infection evolution and at the final, 24-week stage.

the search program was organized in two phases. in the first phase, we changed only one of the parameters at a time , with the others maintaining their original values. in this case the value of the candidate parameter is initially set to 10% of the model estimated parameter, the following to 20%, 30% and so on, until the parameter reaches the upper-bound range that was assumed feasible and physiologically relevant. then, for each changing factor, the model solutions were calculated. in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the change in parameter value, the mean, maximal and final parasite loads were calculated. the mean parasite load reflects the average severity of the disease, the maximal value accounts for the maximal number of parasites along the infection dynamics , and the final parasite load represents the final outcome of the disease.

single-parameter search for identification of optimum parameter values
gi parameter scanning
after a systematic search among all kinetic constants, we found that g <dig> and g <dig> were the most suitable parameters to be changed for reducing parasite load. g <dig>  describes the influence of parasites on their own proliferation and is the most significant in this regard, since changes in its value causes the greatest reduction. this is achieved by increasing g <dig> value from  <dig>  to  <dig>  figure 4a shows the progression of parasite load during a time period of  <dig> weeks for values of g <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  our model suggests that increases in g <dig> from its initial value  have a therapeutic effect, because they lead to a decrease in parasite load and therefore to healing. it is important to note that for values of g <dig> <  <dig> , final parasite load is proportional to g <dig>  however, for values of g <dig> >  <dig> , final parasite load becomes inversely proportional to the value of this parameter. this latter region includes the actual g <dig> value. this implies that therapeutic strategies should aim to increase g <dig>  if decreases are sought, such decreases must be well below  <dig>  in order to have a similar effect.

at first glance this result could appear paradoxical and certainly counterintuitive. but, in fact, the sensitivity of g <dig> with respect to the parasite load , sg1x <dig>  is negative , therefore an increase in g <dig> should lead to a decrease in parasite load. this prediction holds true for the mean parasite load over a time period of  <dig> weeks. however, it has been observed that both the maximum and the final value of parasite load increase in the beginning until they reach a threshold value and decrease from that point on. again, such a decrease in parasite load indicates that increasing g <dig> produces a therapeutic effect. the same result has recently been observed by dancik et al.  <cit> . their model showed that increasing parasite growth rate  impairs the pathogen load in certain stages of the disease. since the modeling strategy used by dancik et al.  <cit>  is different from our approach, there is not a straightforward translation of the parameters. however, there are some correlations between their findings and our model predictions. in particular, their analysis  <cit>  indicates that increasing growth rate can, in some circumstances, suppress pathogen loads, which is what our model also predicts. due to the particular formalism we have used, we are able to point to the increase of g <dig> as the mechanism that increases parasite growth rate. they reported the same evolution pattern in the parasite load that we found: a higher parasite growth rate yields a higher increase in pathogen load in the beginning but also a higher decrease afterwards in such a way that, as a whole, parasites are eliminated earlier. they observed that infection was cleared after eight weeks versus the 17- <dig> weeks in our model, but this can be attributed to the different leishmania strain and the lower initial parasite load . the authors explain this behavior by stating that a pathogen that proliferates rapidly is more likely to be detected by the immune system. therefore, pathogen load decreases as growth rate increases, with slowly replicating pathogens persisting longer than fast growing ones.

another gi parameter with similarly minimizing effects on the parasite load is g <dig>  g <dig> stands for the influence of lymphocytes on their own production. it has been observed that the parasite load  can be reduced by increasing g <dig> from its original value of  <dig>  to  <dig>  . this figure shows that parasite load first increases until reaching a maximum after  <dig> to  <dig> weeks and then abruptly decreases. the effect of the augmentation of g <dig> could be related to system immune response enhancement. lymphocytes need some time to identify the pathogens, thus there is a time lag between the start of immune response, the identification of parasites, and their elimination. accordingly, the parasite load augments until reaching a point where it suddenly decreases.

γi parameter scanning
we also carried out a systematic search among all rate constants. we observed that changes in all γi parameters reduce the final parasite load . the rate constant that yields the minimum for final, maximal and mean parasite load is γ <dig> , which is the rate constant for parasite degradation . figure 6a shows final parasite load for different values of γ <dig>  figure 6b shows the effect on the parasite load for two increased values of γ2:  <dig>  and  <dig> .

combined two-parameter searches for identification of optimum parameter values
we carried out a systematic scanning of all the combinations of two parameters that yielded the minimum final parasite load. the rationale is that a combination of drugs makes it possible to reduce the parasite load in greater quantity, more quickly, and with lighter dosage than using only one drug. the search was limited to smaller parameter changes in the range of 60% - 180% of a parameter's original estimated value.

we found that a total reduction of the observed final  parasite load can be attained by simultaneously increasing g <dig> from its original value by a factor of  <dig>  , and by changing any other of the remaining  <dig> parameters by different factors . the other three variables  remain almost unchanged . figure  <dig> shows all possible combinations of two parameters and the optimum predicted final parasite load. aside from the best combinations  g <dig> and g <dig> are also good choices for the minimization of parasite load. the remaining combinations also produce a reduction of parasite load, but to a lesser degree, and are considered to be of minor interest.

the parameter combination columns stand for the combination of parameter while the fc/fcpk columns indicate the ratio between the factor change  of the original value or g <dig> over the fc of the corresponding parameter 

by way of illustration, table  <dig> show the parameter change factor for the two-parameter combinations involving g <dig> . interestingly, the solutions that lead to the lowest parasite loads have values for most parameters that are approximately 80% higher than their basal values. exceptions include γ <dig>  γ <dig>  γ <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig>  their values are reduced by factors ranging from  <dig> to 85% .

discussion
the standard leishmaniasis treatments are chemotherapy based, though some new treatments are based on the use of immunotherapy. in our model, the chemotherapeutical agents are those that target parasite destruction  or inhibit proliferation , whereas immunotherapeutic treatment implies changing parameters g <dig>  ... g <dig> and g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  g <dig>  ...g <dig>  in most cases the exact interaction mechanism of the drug is not yet known, though it is possible to associate them to the corresponding parameters that are being influenced. it is important to mention that if a given therapeutic agent has an influence that is not represented by any of our model's parameters but corresponds with the in- or outflux of a model variable, the effect of this agent can be translated in our model by a change in the respective rate constant γi.

regarding drug therapy, we have found three parameters which cause parasite load reduction: g <dig>  which describes the influence of parasites on their own proliferation; g <dig>  which represents the influence of lymphocytes on their own proliferation; and γ <dig>  the rate constant for parasite degradation.

examination of the standard drugs used for leishmaniasis treatment shows that most are aimed at parasite destruction. in our model that translates a an increase in γ <dig>  the rate of parasite destruction  <cit> , an observation that is coherent with our model's predictions. this is the case for several standard treatments such as amphotericin b , antimonials , and itraconazole and pyrazolopyrimidines . other substances currently under evaluation, such as betle leaves extract , interferon , and il- <dig>  also increase γ <dig>  these observations constitute a pragmatic, a posteriori verification of our model's predictions.

most of the therapeutic drugs used also seem to inhibit, albeit through different mechanisms, parasite proliferation: aminoglycosides alter parasite messenger rna, pentamidine inhibits polyamine and dna synthesis in the parasite, imidazole and itraconazole inhibit demethylation of membrane, and pyrazolopyrimidines block protein synthesis and destroy parasite rna. all these effects can be interpreted, in terms of our model, as a decrease in g <dig>  the discrepancy in our model's predictions can be explained by several facts. first, in all cases where a decrease in g <dig> could be assumed, there is also the concomitant effect of increasing γ <dig>  as noted above. thus, a trade-off of these two actions should be previously evaluated in order to have an accurate account of the whole drug effect. second, it should be taken into account that the effect of a g <dig> modulation could be different depending on the stage of the disease. it has also been shown that if parasites replicate quickly, the immune system is able to recognize them more easily  <cit> . parasites use mechanisms like inhibition of antigen presentation to escape immune response, however, a high growth rate induces massive macrophage recruitment  <cit> . at this point it should be stressed that our model considers the infection from the very initial stage. a third explanation could be that the parasites produce a certain molecule that stimulates an immune response of the body. 

the factor that increases the influence of parasites on their own proliferation  is crucial according to our model's results; and currently, no pharmaceuticals that increase g <dig> have been tested against leishmania. insuline-like growth factor  <dig>  interferon, and possibly tnf-α cytikine could be considered as potential targets for stimulating parasite replication inside macrophages, and it would be of great interest to test their anti-leishmanial effectiveness. insuline-like growth factor also increases the number of parasites  and reduces parasite-toxic production of nitric oxide .

furthermore, no existing drug is known to have an effect on g <dig>  which, in our analysis, is also seen as a possible effective pharmaceutical target. this clearly points to the new, potential application of existing and current therapeutic strategies.

the approach used for detecting key processes that must be regulated in order to reduce parasite load also allowed us to identify combinations of two drugs that would eventually be more effective than a single drug treatment. as is showed in figure  <dig>  combinations of drugs able to increase g <dig> or g <dig> and simultaneously change any other parameter, or, alternatively, combinations of drugs that decrease g <dig> together with the change in another parameter, would cause significant reduction in the final parasite load. these findings greatly amplify the number of therapeutic options available, although they still remain to be tested. by way of illustration, we could suggest the combination of any of the available drugs that increase g <dig>  together with any of the following: interleukin- <dig> , <dig> and mhc class ii molecules , rlmsti <dig> , and chemokines . in the same mouse model we will test the effects on the variables of different drug combinations to verify the model's predictions and to eventually refine and extend the model by including new variables and mechanisms.

a limitation of the present approach is that our model is a simplification and does not include a detailed description of all the factors involved in the interaction mechanism of the drug in the body. however, given that these mechanisms are often not known, the modeling approach constitutes an approximation to the understanding of a complex dynamic system based on available information and informed hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work we have illustrated a novel approach for the design of effective therapeutic strategies for leishmaniasis treatment. the approach is based on the integration of experimentally available information on infection development in an animal model using a mathematical model that describes the system dynamics observed. many of the predictions concur with the standard practice, while others remain to be explored. we are confident that this rational, model-based approach is of great interest given that it overcomes the limitations of a trial and error strategy, and provides an extra layer of rationality in the search for new therapeutic formulas. this approach is also readily applicable to other parasitic-related illnesses.
