BACKGROUND
notch is a cell-surface receptor. binding of notch to its ligands, such as jagged and delta-like, results in two-step proteolytic cleavages of notch receptor. the second cleavage accomplished by presenilin- <dig> and γ-secretase enzyme complex releases notch intracellular domain  that translocates to the nucleus where it regulates transcription of the notch target genes, such as hes family. this process is the canonical notch signaling  <cit> . nicd can also induce the expression of hes genes through the activation of cytoplasmic signals  <cit> . traditionally, notch signaling is implicated in neural development, including the maintenance of self-renewal potential in stem cells, binary cell-fate determination in progenitor cells and induction of terminal differentiation in proliferating cells  <cit> . accumulating evidence indicates that canonical notch pathway can also be activated in the adult brain subjected to stroke and traumatic brain injury  <cit> . this activation is vital in the regulation of ischemic cerebral damage, adult neurogenesis and regenerative responses after ischemia and reperfusion. however, it is still controversial whether the activated canonical notch signaling is beneficial to the ischemic cerebral tissues.

our previous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with electroacupuncture  at baihui acupoint could induce two phases of tolerance to focal cerebral ischemia, a rapid tolerance occurred at 2 h after ea and a delayed tolerance occurred at 24 h after ea  <cit> . we further elucidate the adenosine, endocannabinoid and cannabinoid receptor type  <dig> are involved in the mechanism underlying rapid ischemic tolerance  <cit> , while cannabinoid receptor  <dig>  is responsible for the induction of delayed tolerance  <cit> . identifying the signals that mediate the neuroprotection of ea pretreatment is fundamental to reveal novel therapeutic targets. thus, we hypothesized that notch signaling is involved in the ea pretreatment-induced tolerance against focal cerebral ischemia. the present study was designed to testify this hypothesis in the rat subjected focal cerebral ischemia.

RESULTS
ea pretreatment significantly increased notch <dig>  notch <dig> and jag <dig> mrna in the striatum before ischemia
real-time rt-pcr analysis for notch <dig>  notch <dig>  jag <dig> and hes <dig> genes, which are major notch pathway components in the central nervous system, in striatum and hippocampus before mcao showed that the notch <dig>  notch <dig> and jag <dig> mrna in striatum in ea group was up-regulated compared with con group. however, the hes <dig> mrna was not changed . there were no significant differences between ea and con groups in the mrna level of the above genes in hippocampus .

ea pretreatment significantly enhanced notch <dig> nicd level and hes <dig> mrna in the striatum at the early stage of reperfusion
real-time rt-pcr analysis for hes <dig> gene in striatum after mcao  showed that in ea group, hes <dig> mrna rapidly increased to the maximum at 2 h after reperfusion , and then gradually returned to the its pre-brain ischemia level. the content of hes <dig> mrna in ea group was significantly higher than that in con group at 2 h and 24 h after reperfusion, respectively . the variation pattern of hes <dig> mrna was different in con group. although hes <dig> mrna level was increased at 2 h, the peak appeared at 72 h after reperfusion .

nicd is regarded as another activation marker of notch signaling. there are four notch receptors in the central nervous system. notch <dig> represents a major function of notch pathway in the brain. thus, we measured notch <dig> nicd level to further evaluate the activation pattern of notch signaling. western blot analysis of striatum revealed that no significant difference in notch <dig> nicd level was detected between ea and con groups before the mcao . in ea group, notch <dig> nicd level was significantly elevated 2 h after reperfusion  and reached the maximum at 24 h . the nicd level of ea group was significantly higher than con group at 2 h and 24 h . the notch <dig> nicd of ea group at 72 h after reperfusion decreased to a level equal to that before i/r and was lower than that in con group at the same time point. in con group, ischemia/reperfusion itself also significantly increased notch <dig> nicd level at 24 h after reperfusion . the notch <dig> nicd level was further increased at 72 h  after reperfusion .

as shown in figure3a, there were few notch <dig> nicd positive cells in sham group, while notch <dig> nicd positive cells were increased in con and ea groups . double immunofluorescent staining showed that nicd immunoreactivity was partially localized to the nuclei of cells that were also positive for neun, a neuronal marker, in the ischemic striatum at 24 h after reperfusion . the quantitation result revealed that there were more notch <dig> nicd positive cells in ea group than con group, and the number of cells positive for both nicd and neun in ea group was also much more than that in con group

intraventricular injections with the γ-secretase inhibitor mw <dig> attenuated the neuroprotective effect of ea pretreatment
we investigated the efficacy of mw <dig> in suppressing activation of notch in the brain in vivo by measuring the level of notch <dig> nicd in ischemic striatum. western blot analysis of ea + mw <dig> and ea groups confirmed that 1 mm mw <dig> effectively inhibited notch signal activation at 24 h after reperfusion .

all rats were sacrificed at 72 h after reperfusion for the measuring the infarct volumes . ea pretreatment remarkably improved functional outcome as indicated by the significantly higher neurological function score  and reduced infarct volume compared with con group  . the infarct volume in ea + mw <dig> group was significantly larger than that in ea group , and the neurological function score was significantly lower than that in ea group . there were no statistical significance in the neurological function score and infarct volume between ea + dmso and ea groups  or con and ea + mw <dig> groups . treatment with mw <dig> in mcao only animals also resulted in reduced brain damage, which manifested as higher neurological function score and decreased infarct volume compared with con group , but the cerebral injury of mw <dig> group was more severe than that of ea and ea + dmso groups  .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our findings provide the first evidence that activation of notch signaling contributes to ea pretreatment-induced cerebral ischemic tolerance. ea pretreatment before ischemia significantly increased notch <dig> notch <dig> receptors and jag <dig> ligand mrna in the striatum of adult rats and did not affect the notch <dig> nicd and hes <dig> mrna levels, suggesting no activation of notch pathway. however, after ischemia/reperfusion, hes <dig> mrna and notch <dig> nicd protein level in ea group reached the peak at 2 h and 24 h, respectively, while both of them reached the peak at 72 h in con group. the earlier activation of notch signal may be caused by the higher expression of notch <dig>  notch <dig> and jag <dig> before ischemia in the ea pretreatment group. although ea pretreatment can not increase the activation of notch pathway before ischemia/reperfusion, it prepared the essential materials for the following notch pathway activation after ischemia/reperfusion. intraventricular injections with mw <dig> can block the cleavage of all four notch receptors and lead to inactivation of notch pathway in the central nervous system  <cit> . the γ-secretase inhibitors may prove to be more superior agents than that target a single cell type, because they may target pathogenic events in multiple cell types  involved in cerebral ischemic injury. our current data demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of ea preconditioning was abrogated in the presence of intraventricular injections with mw <dig>  suggesting that γ-secretase-mediated notch signaling is required for the cerebral ischemic tolerance induced by ea pretreatment. thus, the activated notch signaling at the early stage after reperfusion is beneficial to the survival of neurons in the ischemic cerebral tissues.

although the pivotal roles that notch signaling takes part in the cellular differentiation of the developing central nervous system  have been proved, the functions of the signaling pathway, especially under pathological conditions in the adult cns, remain to be illuminated. a line of data indicates that the expressions of notch receptors were up-regulated after mcao in the brain of rat.  <cit> . the same phenomenon was observed in our study which demonstrated that focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion can enhance hes <dig> mrna and notch <dig> nicd protein level in striatum of adult rat. however, different to our results, kawai et al. found that the mrna of hes <dig>  an important downstream gene of notch signal, was decreased on days  <dig> and  <dig> after global ischemia in rats, suggesting that the notch signaling may be inhibited after transient forebrain ischemia  <cit> . the differences in animal strain, stroke model or treatment regimen may account for the discrepancy. so the phenomenon that ischemia-reperfusion can modulate notch pathway in the cns has been widely accepted.

in this study, we found that intraventricular injections with the γ-secretase inhibitor mw <dig> without ea pretreatment could reduce brain damage and ameliorated functional outcome in a rat model of stroke, suggesting that the inhibition of notch signaling activation after ischemia/reperfusion could lessen the cerebral injury. in accordance with our results, it has been reported that notch signaling increase the vulnerability of neurons to apoptosis. and γ-secretase inhibition improves functional outcome and reduces brain damage in ischemic stroke in mice by activating microglial cells and facilitating the infiltration of proinflammatory leukocytes  <cit> . however, some results support the idea that the activation of notch pathway exerts the neuroprotective effect after ischemia. gastric lavage with soybean isoflavone decreased the ischemia-induced apoptosis in the cerebral cortex and this effect of soybean isoflavone was associated with activation of the notch signaling in the cerebral cortex  <cit> . notch receptor activation inhibits cell death in neural stem cells in vitro rapidly, and this survival effect of notch ligands was antagonized by a γ-secretase inhibitor. a more delayed activation of notch signaling, which was induced by infusing the notch ligand dll <dig> into the cerebral lateral ventricle of adult rats, had no effect on improving cerebral infarct size but improved the motor skills over a period of 45 days  <cit> . a possible explanation for these apparently contradicting results is the different time frame. our data showed that the earlier activation of notch signal after ischemia/reperfusion induced by ea pretreatment provided protective effects.

however, our results raise the issue of why the earlier activation of notch signaling induced by ea can change its characteristic from possible damaging effect to protective effect. the cerebral infarction induced by mcao in rats and mice can be thought as a sphere in which cells in the inner core die rapidly by necrosis, in minutes to a few hours. however the cells in the outer “penumbral regions” die slowly, in a period of days to weeks. the evidence that neurons in the cerebral ischemic penumbra undergo apoptosis was first provided by linnik and coworkers  <cit> . whether or not a neuron survives when exposed to potentially lethal injury is likely to depend upon which of the antiapoptotic and proapoptotic pathways prevails. studies of stroke in animal models support the hypothesis that the brain activates antiapoptotic signaling pathways involving neurotrophic factors and cytokines as responds to ischemic insults. the ischemia-related insults induce the rapid increased expression of several neurotrophic factors and cytokines in the rodent brain, leading to activation of signaling pathways that result in suppressing oxygen radical production and stabilizating cellular calcium homeostasis  <cit> . the effect of notch pathway depends on the integration with other cellular signals, the degree of notch activation, and the time point when the notch pathway is activated during the cell cycle in development  <cit> . earlier activation of notch signaling in the striatum induced by ea pretreatment probably enhanced more survival signals. later activation of notch pathway resulted from ischemia/reperfusion in con induced more neurodegenerative pathways.

previous in vitro studies suggest that the cleavage of notch activates the survival cascade downstream of the insulin receptor involving the serine/threonine kinase akt and mammalian target of rapamycin, and that ser <dig> phosphorylation of stat <dig> also mediates the survival effects induced by notch activation in neural stem cells  <cit> . there is a crucial physiologically crosstalk between the two major signal transduction pathways — notch–hes and jak–stat in the central nervous system  <cit> . it is demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of ea pretreatment may be relevant to activation of pi3k/akt and jak/stat signals  <cit> . these results imply that the activation of notch signaling may link the ea pretreatment with some survival signal transducers. notch pathway is also a useful paradigm to demonstrate the complexity of cross-talk pathway with nuclear factor-kb, transforming growth factor-β and wnt signalings in ischemia/reperfusion  <cit> .

in conclusion, the current study provides novel insights into the neuroprotection induced by ea pretreatment: ea preconditioning induces neuroprotection by controlling the timing of notch pathway activation. however, further studies are demanded to delineate the downstream factors of notch signaling for understanding the mechanisms of ea pretreatment-induced brain ischemia tolerance.
