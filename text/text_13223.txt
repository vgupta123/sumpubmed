BACKGROUND
plant-associated microorganisms, especially endophytic fungi, are largely underexplored in the discovery of natural products  <cit> . the prolific endophytes also have a capacity to produce diverse class of plant associated secondary metabolites with a wide variety of biological activities such as antimicrobial agent hypericin  <cit> , acetylcholinesterase inhibitor huperzine a  <cit> , and antitumor agents taxol  <cit> . bioprospecting endophytes thus offers tremendous promise to discover natural products with therapeutic value  <cit> , which have attracted increasing attention among microbiologists, ecologists, agronomists, and chemists.

among plant-derived natural products, taxol  is widely used for clinical application against different types of cancer  <cit> . it was originally obtained from extraction of the bark of taxus species. however, mass production of taxol remains a vexing problem due to low taxol content in the taxus species.  <dig>  kg of t. brevifolia  bark only yields about  <dig> kg of taxol  <cit> , whereas at least  <dig> g of taxol is required for a full regimen of antitumor treatment in a patient  <cit> . with the increasing demand for taxol and the shortage of plant resource, there is an urgent need to find other alternative production methods.

several alternative strategies have been developed for taxol production during the past two decades. total chemical synthesis is available  <cit> , but the large number of reaction steps and low yield limit its practicality. semisynthesis from taxol precursors baccatin iii or 10-deacetylbaccatin iii solves the supply problem of taxol which appears so formidable, but still relies on plant precursor compounds with difficulty in the purification process  <cit> . plant tissue culture as an environmentally sustainable method is successfully developed for large-scale taxol production, but long incubation time and low yield render it an economic impossibility  <cit> . notwithstanding the remarkable progress in the different production alternatives, these methods are not enabled to meet the increasing taxol demand with an economic supply  <cit> . consequently, more production options are still required to lower the price of taxol and increase its availability.

taxomyces andreanae is the first report of a microbial taxol producer from pacific yew  <cit> , implying that microorganisms as a potential source would be one of the most desirable means for taxol supply. potential advantages of microbial taxol production include a fast growth at high cell density cultivation, easy genetic manipulation, and the possibility of scale-up on an industrial level  <cit> . in addition, microbial production helps to protect natural plant taxus resources  <cit> . current research in this field is focused on screening taxol-producing endophytic microbes  <cit> , improving taxol yield by genome shuffling  <cit> , genetic engineering  <cit> , and process optimization  <cit> , and heterologous expression of taxol precursor in microorganisms  <cit> .

isolation of endophytic microorganisms is a comparatively simple process, but taxol detection of all isolates is laborious  <cit> . compared to this traditional screening method, the molecular marker screening is an efficient alternative method to find taxol-producing microbes  <cit> . three probes based on key genes of taxol biosynthetic cluster, ts , dbat , and bapt , have been applied in the primary screening of taxol-producing endophytic microorganisms . currently, more than  <dig> endophytic microorganisms have been reported to produce taxol with ranging from  <dig> ng/l to  <dig> μg/l through the traditional screening/molecular marker screening  <cit> ; the majority of endophytic microbes belong to fungi such as ascomycetes and imperfect fungi, and a minority are bacteria such as kitasatospora and streptomyces. however, to date, there are only a few reports to investigate biodiversity of microorganisms living in taxus <cit> . in this work, we surveyed the endophytic fungi diversity of t. media, and discovered taxol-producing endophytes from the fungal isolates based on molecular markers derived from key biosynthetic enzymes of taxol. to our knowledge, guignardia is the first report to produce taxol.

RESULTS
endophytic fungal diversity of t. media
to assess the presence of fungal endophytes in t. media,  <dig> fungal isolates were recovered and assigned to  <dig> morphotypes using dereplication based on the morphological characteristics and unique phenotypic characters . the identified fungi belonged to the phylum ascomycota. to confirm the reliability of morphological identification, all  <dig> morphotypes  were subjected to molecular identification based on its rdna sequence analysis . the  <dig> morphospecies were grouped into  <dig> genera . analysis of distribution frequencies of the  <dig> morphotypes revealed that the fungal communities in the host contained two frequent genera and many infrequent groups . glomerella and colletotrichum were the dominant genera, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of colonization frequencies . among the rare genera, alternaria and guignardia represented ~ <dig> % of isolation frequencies, whereas others showed ~ <dig> % of colonization frequencies . our result confirmed that a few species are frequent colonizers, and yet the majority are rare inhabitants in woody plants  <cit> .

although glomerella and colletotrichum are frequent colonizers in t. media  in this study, they are not cosmopolitan species within other taxus plants  <cit> , such as the frequent genera diaporthe, phomopsis, acremonium, and pezicula in t. chinensis , and myceliasterilia, alternaria, and fusarium in t. baccata and t. brevifolia , indicating that the dominant genera are distinct in different yews and different geographic region  <cit> . the genera glomerella and gibberella were first reported endophytes in taxus, but they have been isolated from other host plants  <cit> .

in total,  <dig> distinctive genotypes were detected at a 99% sequence similarity threshold , which did not correspond well with morphological differences between these fungal cultures. strains haa <dig>  hba <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  and ta <dig> were located with a high bootstrap support  in their own cluster, while strains haa <dig>  haa <dig>  hba <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  ta <dig>  and ta <dig> formed their own cluster with a bootstrap value from  <dig> to 99%. strains haa <dig>  haa <dig>  haa <dig>  haa <dig>  haa <dig>  haa <dig>  hba <dig>  hba <dig>  hba <dig>  hba <dig>  and hba <dig> were clustered to colletotrichum boninense with a bootstrap value of 90%, but sequence identities with the available references in ncbi were very high . in addition, strain haa <dig> was not similar to any references with a bootstrap value of 63%, but shared sequence similarities of 99% with c. boninens. it might represent novel species or even new genera.

primary screening of taxol-producing fungi based on molecular marker
molecular marker based screening is a rapid and efficient alternative to find taxol-producing endophytic microbes in contrast to the traditional screening method  <cit> . this method is not dependent on the production of paclitaxel and can indicate the presence of some required genes for taxol biosynthesis in the microbial genome. in yew trees, taxol biosynthesis involves  <dig> enzymatic steps from the universal diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate  by the plastidial methyl erythritol phosphate pathway  <cit> . we thus chose ts , dbat , and bapt , three key genes in taxol biosynthesis, as a primary screening to identify taxol-producing fungi.

all  <dig> fungal isolates with distinctive genotype separated from t. media were consecutively screened for the presence of ts, dbat, and bapt genes. three fungi  had positive hits of ts and dbat. the ts and dbat genes are essential for taxol biosynthesis but not diagnostic because taxol precursor baccatin iii producers also have ts and dbat. thus, the  <dig> fungi were screened for the presence of bapt. interestingly, all these  <dig> fungi had approximately  <dig> bp fragments of bapt gene , suggesting that all of them may produce taxol. currently, only ts, dbat, and bapt genes have been used as molecular probes for the primary screening of taxol producing microorganisms  <cit> , thus designing suitable degenerate primers for amplification of more target genes, e.g., the final acylation step in taxol biosynthesis, taxoid c13-side-chain n-benzoyltransferase , may be a better option for screening.

identification of fungal taxol
we screened the extracts of the  <dig> representative species guignardia mangiferae haa <dig>  fusarium proliferatum hba <dig>  and colletotrichum gloeosporioides ta <dig> with positive results in the primary screening to detect fungal taxol by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . the hplc peak positions and peak shapes of the  <dig> representative species from the different genera were identical to that of standard taxol , indicating the  <dig> distinct fungi may produce taxol. further convincing evidence for the identity of the fungal taxol was obtained by high resolution ms . characteristically, the authentic taxol yielded an - peak at m/z  <dig>  and an - peak at m/z  <dig> . by comparison, the fungal taxol also yielded a peak at m/z  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and a characteristic fragment peak at m/z  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the peaks of fungal taxol exhibited m/z ratios corresponding to the molecular ions of standard taxol, demonstrating that the  <dig> fungal endophytes can generate taxol in vitro. among these  <dig> taxol-producing fungi, strain haa <dig> had the highest taxol yield  in the pdb medium in comparison with those of strains hba <dig>  and ta <dig> .

colletotrichum gloeosporioides has been proven to be capable of producing taxol   <cit> . guignardia mangiferae and fusarium proliferatum have not been obtained from other yews and some reported taxol-producing fungi from other taxus plants have not been isolated from t. media in this work, suggesting that yews in different geographic regions can harbor novel and highly diverse taxol producing fungi and certain taxol-generating fungi may be host-specific. thus, to isolate taxol-producing fungal species, more consideration should be given to different hosts under different conditions. in addition, guignardia mangiferae haa <dig> and fusarium proliferatum hba <dig> were recovered as infrequent genera, indicating that infrequent genera from taxus might be a huge source of taxol-producing fungi  <cit> .

although taxol concentration of guignardia mangiferae haa <dig>  fusarium proliferatum hba <dig>  and colletotrichum gloeosporioides ta <dig> is relatively lower than that of taxus species, the high growth rate and short generation time make them worthwhile to continue investigation. thus, to meet the commercial need for taxol, further work will focus on improving taxol yield in fungi by combination of various biotechnological approaches such as strain improvement, genetic manipulation, and fermentation engineering. in addition, the lack of a complete taxol biosynthetic cluster  is at present a bottleneck for basic and applied research, genome sequencing and analysis of taxol-producing microorganisms  thus could significantly expand the number of known taxol biosynthetic genes to elucidate the whole pathway and provide the basis for heterologous production. from an evolutionary adaptation point of view, endophytic microorganism harboring particular metabolic functions could be achieved extraordinary success in occupying a niche within plant tissues or even contribute to host defense against various invading pathogens  <cit> , hence, analysis of genes involved in taxol synthesis from the diverse fungi will significantly enhance our understanding of the co-evolutionary mechanism of the endophyte host  <cit> .

ts and bapt genes between taxol-producing fungi and taxus
the amplified dna fragments of ts  and bapt  were sequenced and analyzed using blastn in the ncbi database. the ts segment from strain hba <dig> shares  <dig> % identity with cdna of ts from t. media . the bapt segments from strains haa <dig> and ta <dig> have lower identity  with cdna of bapt from t. media , indicating that it might be a fragment of the new putative fungal bapt gene. despite our findings are contrary to all previous works of ts and bapt from endophytic fungi which show high homology  with theirs plant counterparts  <cit> , the success of our screening for microbial ts, dbat and bapt using the designed pcr primer based on the conserved regions of key genes of taxol biosynthetic pathway in yew provides crucial evidence for the molecular blueprint of taxol biosynthesis being an inherent genetic trait of endophytic fungi. moreover, the detection of taxol production affords definitive proof for the presence of taxol pathway in endophytic fungi. consequently, low similarity of ts and bapt between plant and microbial origin seems to give a new insight to the controversial hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer . the evolutionary trajectory of taxol gene cluster between microbial and plant origin might be coexisting. although hgt in fungi are largely reported  <cit> , the ultimate plausibility of microbial taxol gene cluster by hgt hypothesis should be revisited and further investigated because approximately  <dig> genes involved in the taxol biosynthesis make hgt rather unlikely. additionally, taxol-producing endophytic fungi have been isolated from plants which themselves are not capable of producing taxol  <cit> , suggesting that taxol biosynthesis in fungi may not be acquired from hgt. in nature, gibberellin biosynthetic pathways in fungi and higher plants have evolved independently and not by hgt  <cit> . we thus assumed that taxol biosynthetic cluster might be repeatedly invented during evolution. moreover, it raises an intriguing question: whether the genes responsible for fungal taxol biosynthesis are indeed grouped in a contiguous cluster?

CONCLUSIONS
eighty-one endophytic fungi isolated from t. media were grouped into  <dig> genera based on the morphological and molecular identification. guignardia and colletotrichum were the dominant genera, whereas the remaining genera were infrequent groups. three representative species of the distinct genera can produce taxol. this is the first report of taxol prodcer from guignardia. the highest taxol yield was  <dig> ng/l by guignardia mangiferae haa- <dig>  moreover, the lower similarities of ts and bapt between microbial and plant origin indicated that fungal taxol biosynthetic cluster might be repeatedly invented during evolution, nor hgt from taxus species.
