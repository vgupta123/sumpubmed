BACKGROUND
one of the important insights of quasi-species theory is the existence of an error-threshold  <cit> . the error-threshold is the error rate of replication above which the sudden onset of the population delocalization from the fittest genotype occurs despite darwinian selection; i.e., the break down of evolutionary optimization. the error-threshold hampers the evolutionary accumulation of information through increasing the genome size of the replicator because a longer genome receives mutations more frequently for a given error rate  <cit> .

a recent article of wilke reviewed the quasi-species theory in the context of population genetics  <cit> . while the use of quasi-species theory in understanding of virus evolution is often seen , some studies argue that quasi-species theory contradicts population genetics, questioning the pertinence of quasi-species theory in this context . the article by wilke resolved such misconceptions, and pointed out the usefulness and the problems of the current theory of virus evolution.

however, wilke also argued that the existence of an error-threshold is one of the "beliefs" about quasi-species theory  <cit> . to quote: "can the error threshold occur in a more realistic fitness landscape that contains lethal genotypes? no. wagner and krall have proven mathematically that the condition for the existence of an error threshold is precisely the complete absence of lethal genotypes  <cit> ". since lethal mutants obviously exist, the above statement has a significant implication about the relevance of the error-threshold in biological evolution: in particular, the accumulation of information. however, the study of wagner and krall  <cit> , on which his conclusion was based, considered mutation-selection dynamics in one-dimensional genotype space  with the assumption that a genotype can mutate only to another genotype adjacent to the original one in the genotype space. in contrast, quasi-species theory explicitly considers high-dimensional genotype space  with the consideration of both adjacent and non-adjacent mutations. since the possibility of mutations can be considerably greater in the latter setting, this can give rise to qualitative differences in the mutation-selection dynamics.

furthermore, high-dimensional sequence space is a more realistic  representation of genotype space than one-dimensional genotype chain in view of a genome as sequences of dna . thus, the aim of this article is to examine the above statement about the effect of lethality on the error-threshold by considering high-dimensional genotype space with the inclusion of non-adjacent mutations.

RESULTS

the mathematical definition  of error-threshold has been extensively discussed in literatures . in the current study, we first adopt the same criterion as that employed in the study of wagner and krall  <cit> , on which the conclusion of wilke  <cit>  is based, for comparison. in this criterion, by neglecting back mutations, the error-threshold can be calculated as the maximum allowable error rate for which the fittest genotype can survive  <cit> . later, taking full consideration of back mutations, we study the effect of lethality on the error-threshold by examining the equilibrium population distribution and the ancestor distribution in the genotype space as a function of error rate.

error-threshold in the model without back mutations
in this section, we study the effect of lethality on the error-threshold by following the criterion of the error-threshold employed in  <cit> . in this criterion, the error-threshold is calculated as the error rate above which the fittest genotype cannot survive without back mutation. a back mutation is defined as a mutation which increases the fitness of a genotype as in  <cit> . for g

error-threshold in the model with back mutations
in this section, we will examine the effect of lethality on the distribution of the population in the genotype space with the full consideration of back mutations. it is assumed in the following that the fitness landscape is multiplicative; i.e., fd decreases exponentially with d .

the stationary solution of eq.  can be calculated as a normalized eigen vector associated with the greatest eigen value of the matrix representing the linear part of eq.   <cit> . first, the stationary solution was calculated without the lethality of mutants as depicted in fig.  <dig> . as fig.  <dig> shows, the population fraction of every genotype rapidly and smoothly converges to the same limiting value, which is the population fraction for completely random replication . . thus, it can be said that the population is delocalized from the fittest genotype for error rates sufficiently high but yet much smaller than that of completely random replication – evolutionary optimization breaks down. furthermore, the population distribution does not show any discontinuous transition, and thus there is no error "threshold" as already stated in  <cit> . the next step of the study is to examine the effect of the lethality of mutants on the behavior of eq. . the stationary solutions of eq.  were numerically calculated with lethality. a typical result of calculation is depicted in fig.  <dig> for high lethality [κ =  <dig> ; however, note that round)/

below, we study the emergence of an error-threshold due to the lethality of mutants and the delocalization of population in more detail.

how high must lethality be to introduce an error-threshold?
as seen above, high lethality of mutants can, in fact, introduce an error-threshold. in the following, we elucidate the relationship between lethality and the error-threshold by extending the characterization of the error-threshold. the method employed for this sake, which was introduced in  <cit> , is as follows. the difference between the greatest eigen value and the second greatest eigen value of the linear part of eq.  becomes minimum at the error-threshold, and hence, this provides a convenient measure of the error-threshold. as fig.  <dig> shows, there is an error rate for which the greatest eigen value becomes very close to the second greatest eigen value for a sufficiently small value of κ and this error rate is identified as the error-threshold. however, for a greater κ, the difference between the two eigen values does not become very small, and this corresponds to the absence of the error-threshold for a high value of κ. however, it is noteworthy that the characteristic shape of the curves in fig.  <dig> is present for all κ <  <dig> shown in the figure, and therefore it is possible to identify a distinctive error rate for which the difference between the eigen values is minimum.

effect of sequence length on the error-threshold
to examine the effect of sequence length on the error-threshold, the error-threshold measured through the above method is plotted for various sequence length in fig.  <dig>  for high lethality of mutants . as is clear from this plot, the error-threshold decreases as ν increases. furthermore, as shown by fig.  <dig> , the maximum tolerable genomic mutation rate  increases as ν increases, which strengthen the last result . as discussed previously, the increase of ν is due to the assumption of a constant f0/f <dig> with respect to ν, under which f0/fν2

effect of lethality on the ancestor distribution
above, the effect of lethality on the mutation-selection dynamics was studied in terms of the equilibrium population distribution. from the evolutionary point of view, however, it will add significant information to study this in terms of the genealogical success of each genotype in an evolutionary time scale. the "ancestor distribution"  <cit>  reveals which ancestral genotype  the current population has originated from. by following  <cit> , the ancestor distribution is defined as ad≡lim⁡τ→∞t→∞ad

the average hamming distance of the ancestor distribution from the fittest genotype, ∑d=0νad

effect of finite populations
to examine the above results without the assumption of infinite population size, we study the role of lethality  in relatively small finite populations by focusing on the the ancestors of the population . however, in the system of a finite population, the entire population will share a single last common ancestor after a sufficiently long time in contrast to the system of infinite population. thus, instead of the ancestor distribution, here we study the distribution of the common ancestors of the population .

we constructed a finite population model which follows mutation-selection dynamics described by eq. , by basically following the implementation described in  <cit> . in the current model, lethality was implemented as discarding a new born individual which is determined as a lethal mutant. for simplicity, determining a new born as a lethal mutant was implemented as a chance event with the probability of  <dig> - κ; thus, genotypes were not explicitly assigned as lethal genotypes. the population size was approximately  <dig>  and ν =  <dig> , and fd =  <dig>  ×  <dig> d .

in the above model, the average hamming distance between the fittest genotype and the common ancestors was calculated after sufficiently long simulation steps . in fig.  <dig> , a typical result of such a calculation is plotted for high lethality of mutants  as a function of error rate. as seen from this plot, the distance of the common ancestors matches very well with the distance of the ancestor distribution from the infinite population model  for small and large error rates, exhibiting the genealogical delocalization of the population for high error rates. moreover, as seen in the same plot, the distance of the ancestor distribution suddenly increases at a critical error-rate, which indicates the existence of a error-threshold. this error-threshold is smaller than that of the infinite population as expected  <cit> . we next take a closer look at the finite population model for error rates between the error-threshold of the infinite population model and that of the finite population model. in fig.  <dig>  the distance of the common ancestors obtained from the finite population model is plotted against the time step at which the common ancestors were born . as seen from this plot, there are two meta-stable modes in the common ancestor distribution. one mode corresponds to the ancestor distribution of the infinite population model below the error-threshold ; the other corresponds to that above the error-threshold . apparently, due to the stochasticity and the proximity of the two greatest eigen values , the common ancestor distribution randomly switches between the two modes.  the above results show that the system of a finite population also displays a transition-like behavior in the distribution of the common ancestors although in a qualitatively different manner from that of the ancestor distribution of the infinite population model. in conclusion, the error-threshold exists for high lethality of mutants also in the finite population model.

discussion
in the current study, high-dimensional genotype space and multiple substitutions per replication were taken into consideration, in order to investigate the effect of mutant lethality on mutation-selection dynamics. on one hand, the model was analyzed by neglecting back mutations to compare the results with  <cit> . the results showed the extinction of the fittest genotype can happen even with high lethality of mutants because of mutations within the same genotype class. on the other hand, the model was analyzed with the consideration of back mutations from three aspects. the first aspect is the equilibrium population distribution, which tells the state of the population at one moment after a sufficiently long time. the second aspect is the difference between the greatest and second greatest eigen values, which represents the aspect of singularity in the population distribution as a function of error rate. the last aspect is the ancestor distribution. this tells the genealogical description of the population in a long time scale, which is significant information from the point of view of evolution. the results showed that the investigations from these three aspects give a consistent picture about the error-threshold introduced by high lethality of mutants and about the delocalization of the population from the fittest genotype for a sufficiently high error rate irrespective of the lethality of mutants. furthermore, the effect of a finite population was studied, and our results were shown to extend to the system of finite populations.

four additional points should be noted in the current study. first, the biological implication of the error-threshold is that it hampers the accumulation of information through increasing the genome size of the replicators  <cit> . in the case of low lethality of mutants, it was shown that there is no error-threshold in a multiplicative fitness landscape. however, this does not mean that the accumulation of information is not hampered; on the contrary, it is hampered by the delocalization of the population from the fittest genotype. second, the population size was assumed to be constant as is often done. an artifact of this simplification is, among others, the impossibility of population extinction. third, the fitness was assumed to be a function of the number of substitutions  so that the grouping of genotypes by d is straightforward. for other settings, one can consult  <cit> , which estimates the error-threshold in a fitness landscape where the fitness of a genotype is determined from a probability distribution. forth, the error-threshold was considered only in terms of the fittest replicator. however, the error-threshold can be also considered for mutant classes . as shown in  <cit>  for "royal road fitness landscape", if the error rate is beyond the error-threshold of the fittest, the population can still be localized in sequence space albeit at a lower fitness level, for which a new error-threshold again exists.

CONCLUSIONS
• irrespective of the lethality of mutants, the delocalization of the population from the fittest genotype – the break down of evolutionary optimization – happens for an error rate much smaller than that of random replication.

• high lethality of mutants introduces an error-threshold in a multiplicative fitness landscape.

quasispecies theory  <cit>  is a deterministic theory of mutation-selection balance for multi-site models, applicable in particular but not exclusively to settings of high mutation pressure, such as the evolution of rna viruses. the theory has often been perceived as an alternative to and possibly even contradictory to classical population genetics. in a recent review  <cit> , i tried to clear up these misconceptions, and demonstrated that the quasispecies equations are equivalent to the equations used in population genetics to describe the deterministic evolution of asexual replicators. i also touched on the error threshold, probably the most widely discussed and at the same time most frequently misunderstood aspect of quasispecies theory. i argued that the existence and location of the error threshold are not universal, and that the error threshold is not related to population extinction. moreover, citing a proof by wagner and krall  <cit> , i claimed that an error threshold cannot occur if a fitness landscape contains lethal genotypes.

takeuchi and hogeweg  <cit>  now present a counterexample to my claim, a fitness landscape on which an error threshold occurs even though lethal genotypes exist. this finding does not invalidate wagner and krall's work, but it demonstrates that we cannot generalize wagner and krall's result – derived for a one-dimensional fitness landscape – to higher dimensions. takeuchi and hogeweg's result is a welcome contribution to the quasispecies literature, and it reminds us that generalization from simplified mathematical models to more complex situations can be dangerous. however, this result is of minor consequence to my review. the main conclusions in my the section on error thresholds remain valid:  whether an error threshold exists depends on the details of the fitness landscape. for example, as takeuchi and hogeweg acknowledge, the purely multiplicative fitness landscape does not display an error threshold.  if an error threshold exists, its location depends on the details of the fitness landscape as well. this fact is demonstrated for example in fig.  <dig> of takeuchi and hogeweg's article.  most importantly, the error threshold is not related to publication extinction. population extinction occurs when the absolute population size n drops to zero. models of the error threshold, including the one by takeuchi and hogeweg, generally operate on relative mutant frequencies while holding the total population size n constant. if we generalize the quasispecies equations to allow for variable n, we find – in the deterministic limit, i.e., for large n – that population extinction is not tied to the error threshold  <cit> . in fact, under certain conditions, an error threshold may delay or even prevent population extinction brought about by an increase in the mutation rate  <cit> .

to summarize, while takeuchi and hogeweg make a valid and important contribution to our understanding of error thresholds, their work does not affect my conclusions on the relationship between quasispecies theory and population genetics, nor does it invalidate in any substantive way the statements i made about error thresholds.
