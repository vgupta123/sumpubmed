BACKGROUND
the main african vectors of malaria are in the anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes  <cit> . in general, all species of anopheles have been found to be susceptible to a certain extent to infection by some strain of human plasmodia  <cit> . studies on lepidopteran insects revealed several types of bt toxin-binding proteins : aminopeptidase n  -like proteins  <cit> ; cadherin-like proteins  <cit> ; a glycoconjugate  <cit>  and glycolipids  <cit> . in mosquitoes, two types of receptors were discovered: a protein with maltase activity from culex. pipiens that binds the bin toxin of bacillus sphaericus  <cit> , and a  <dig> kda protein of unknown function  from aedes aegypti that binds cry4ba and cry11aa  <cit> . two apns have been identified in ae. aegypti but not associated with binding cry proteins  <cit> 

apns  are exopeptidases that cleave single amino acids from the n-terminus of a polypeptide. apns are expressed in many tissues including the brain, the lung, blood vessels, primary cultures of fibroblasts  <cit> , and have the highest levels in intestinal and kidney brushborder membranes  <cit> . apns belong to the m <dig> family of zinc metallopeptidases  <cit> , which includes related enzymes like aminopeptidase a  <cit> , aminopeptidase b  <cit> , and leukotriene a <dig> hydrolase  <cit> . apns have also been implicated as cellular receptors for human, canine, and feline coronaviruses  <cit> .

in this study, intestinal apn from an. quadrimaculatus larvae was isolated and tested for binding ability to different mosquitocidal cry toxins . membrane proteins were extracted from an. quadrimaculatus brush border membrane vesicles  and separated by anion-exchange chromatography. fractions containing apn activity were pooled and purified by size-exclusion chromatography. a 100-kda protein with apn activity was isolated from the bbmv and its n-terminal sequence was determined to be aqledyrlnddvrptayrie. this protein was used to screen different mosquitocidal cry toxins binding via biacore analysis. from the screening, it was discovered that only cry11ba was able to bind the apn. a protein blast search limited to the arthropod database revealed three highly homologous an. gambiae apns based on the n-terminal sequence.

RESULTS
purification of an. quadrimaculatus aminopeptidase n
spr analysis requires purified ligands and analytes to be used. solubilized an. quadrimaculatus bbmv proteins were separated by anion-exchange chromatography and all elution fractions were tested for apn activity. fractions 19– <dig> and 24– <dig> showed apn activity. fractions 19– <dig> were made up of a single peak, and fractions 24– <dig> were made up of at least two peaks . fractions 19– <dig> were pooled, concentrated, and purified further by size-exclusion chromatography. a single peak was eluted at around  <dig> ml of run volume that correspond to a protein size of about  <dig> kda . this peak was collected and was determined to hold apn activity. sds-page analysis of the protein also indicated a size of  <dig> kda  and the  <dig> kda protein was highly purified. the  <dig> kda protein was named apnanq  <dig> 

determination of binding affinity by spr analysis
initially, apnanq  <dig> was evaluated for binding by spr analysis to four cry toxins , which were previously determined in this laboratory to have mosquitocidal activity towards an. quadrimaculatus . only cry11ba bound significantly to apnanq  <dig>  further analysis of real-time binding kinetic of cry11ba to apnanq  <dig> was performed at different analyte concentrations , followed by global fitting of all the response curves. a 1: <dig> binding stoichiometry, including a drifting-baseline correction, produced the following apparent rate constants of the bimolecular interaction: ka =  <dig>  m-1s- <dig>  and kd =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> s- <dig> , kd =  <dig>  nm. more complex binding models, such as 2-site independent binding , and 2-site sequential binding  also gave as good fitting as the simple 1: <dig> binding  with χ <dig> =  <dig>  .

n-terminal sequence of apnanq100
a twenty amino acid residue sequence  was obtained from n-terminal sequencing of purified apnanq  <dig>  data mining for similar sequences in the arthropod databases revealed high homology  with  <dig> conceptual translated proteins from an. gambiae . a blast search using the first protein's full amino acid sequence from an. gambiae  revealed homology with many aminopeptidases from organisms of other genera . this would suggest that the three proteins from an. gambiae have aminopeptidase activity.

analysis of the n-terminal region with the program signalp () predicted that the most probable cleavage site for the signal peptide sequence was between position  <dig> and  <dig> for eaa <dig> ; between position  <dig> and  <dig> for eaa <dig> ; and between position  <dig> and  <dig> for eaa <dig> . however, the sequences of the proteins shown in table  <dig> start at positions further downstream from the predicted cleavage sites, which suggested that there might have been further processing of the n-terminal region of the an. quadrimaculatus apn. analysis of the c-terminal region for possible glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchor sites using the program big-pi predictor () found no potential gpi-modification site for eaa <dig> . potential gpi-modification sites were found at position  <dig> and  <dig> for eaa <dig>  and eaa <dig> , respectively. analysis of the sequences using the program netoglyc  <dig>  ()  <cit>  to reveal potential galnac o-glycosylation sites found  <dig> sites in eaa <dig> ,  <dig> sites in eaa <dig> , and  <dig> sites in eaa <dig> . analysis of the sequences using netnglyc  <dig>  ()  <cit>  to reveal potential n-glycosylation sites found  <dig> sites in eaa <dig> ,  <dig> sites in eaa <dig> , and  <dig> sites in eaa <dig> .

* hexxh motif for the apn zinc-iron-binding site does not exist in this sequence, which would exclude this protein from the metallopeptidase family.

another protein blast search was performed using the sequence of a known conserved region for aminopeptidases   <cit> , which yielded  <dig> homologous proteins from the an. gambiae genomic database . this indicated that there are a large number of aminopeptidase isomers in these mosquitoes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
an aminopeptidase n  type protein has been implicated as a cry toxin-binding protein in several lepidopteran species: manduca sexta  <cit> , bombyx mori  <cit> , lymantria dispar  <cit> , heliothis virescens  <cit> , plutella xylostella  <cit> , trichoplusia ni  <cit> , helicoverpa armigera  <cit>  and spodoptera litura  <cit> . recently the binding epitopes of cry1aa to an apn from b. mori have been mapped by monoclonal antibody inhibition  <cit> . thus, targeting apn for analysis as a possible toxin-binding protein is a reasonable approach.

the surface plasmon resonance  method allows analysis of bimolecular interaction in the native state, without a potentially interfering label  <cit> . thus, since the cry11ba and apnanq  <dig> interaction detected in this study represents tight  native-state binding, we propose that apnanq  <dig> is a putative receptor for cry11ba. apnanq  <dig> did not bind to cry2aa, cry4ba or cry11aa even though the toxins have insecticidal activity against an. quadrimaculatus. the specific binding of cry11ba to apnanq  <dig> suggests that its mode of action would be different from cry2aa, cry4ba, or cry11aa.

the n-terminal sequence of apnanq  <dig> showed high homology with three putative apns from an. gambiae. one or more of these apns could act as a binding protein for cry11ba.

recently the binding epitopes of cry1aa to an apn from b. mori have been mapped by monoclonal antibody inhibition  <cit> .
