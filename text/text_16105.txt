BACKGROUND
linkage maps have been widely used to identify genomic regions that influence phenotypic traits. in addition to the expected advances in fine-mapping of quantitative trait loci 
 <cit> , high-density linkage maps provide a framework for checking the assembly of genome sequences and for studies of the evolution of these genomes through the analysis of recombination. indeed, recombination lies at the heart of every genetic analysis, and whereas linkage maps in the past were constructed primarily to aid in the generation of a physical map, linkage maps are currently being recognized as indispensable tools to study virtually every aspect of genome biology. genomic features that have been shown to correlate with recombination rate include gc content, gene density, gene expression, epigenetic modifications, nucleosome formation, repetitive element composition, isochore structure, but also patterns of genetic variation and differentiation within and between populations. for this reason, increasingly dense recombination maps have been constructed in the so called ‘post-genomic era’ for species such as human and mouse, focussing on identifying hotspots of recombination, and, recently, variation in the use of these hotspots between populations and between sexes.

despite the evident importance of accurate and comprehensive linkage maps in the post-genomic era, comprehensive maps are currently only available for a handful of vertebrate species . this limited coverage of the recombination landscape severely limits the possibility of drawing general conclusions about the recombination rates in genomes, particularly now that it is becoming increasingly clear that various mechanisms can work together in creating a very dynamic use of recombination hotspots over time
 <cit> .

in swine, the first linkage map covering all the autosomes plus the x chromosome of the pig was established in 1995
 <cit>  and a denser map comprising about  <dig>  markers was published in 1996
 <cit> . two other linkage maps comprising around  <dig> loci were published in the late 1990s
 <cit> . these four maps were mainly based on microsatellites, restriction fragment length polymorphisms  and protein polymorphisms. more recently, snps were added to these maps
 <cit> , but the resolution remained low with an average inter-snp distance of  <dig>  cm. with the advent of genome-wide high-density snp chips, genetic maps can comprise an increasing number of markers. until now, such high-density genetic maps, based on microsatellites and snps, have been computed for human
 <cit> , mouse
 <cit> , chicken
 <cit> , cattle
 <cit>  and dog
 <cit> . with the release of illumina's porcine snp <dig> beadchip
 <cit> , it became possible to construct a high-density recombination map of the porcine genome. in this work, we present four recombination maps for four different pedigrees. a single set of snps was used, each snp being informative in at least one of the four pedigrees. the recombination maps were estimated using a priori knowledge of the snps' order. this physical order of the snps was based on the position of the snps on the porcine radiation hybrid  map
 <cit>  and on the positions of the snps in the pig genome sequence .

RESULTS
genotyping quality
the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip, which provides assays for  <dig>  snps, was used to genotype the four studied pedigrees . the a priori order used to compute the recombination map comprised  <dig>  snps:  <dig>  from the rh order, and  <dig>  derived from the sequence assembly. of the  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  snps were discarded because of their low call-rate , and an set of  <dig> snps was removed because they exhibited a large number of mendelian inconsistencies in several families. when mendelian inconsistencies were only limited to one particular family per pedigree, genotypes were considered as missing in this family. a total of  <dig> individuals were removed from the four pedigrees because of their high proportion of incorrect genotypes due to either pedigree or genotyping errors. finally, the average number of informative meiosis per marker was  <dig> for ill,  <dig> for uiuc,  <dig> for usda and  <dig> for ros.

*the usda pedigree was derived from a population composed of ¼ duroc, ¼ large white, ¼ maternal landrace and ¼ high growth landrace.

recombination maps
the a priori order, on which the recombination analyses were based, comprised  <dig>  snps, including  <dig> snps mapped to unplaced scaffolds and  <dig> snps with no sequence match on the genome assembly. finally, we were able to construct a genetic map with a total of  <dig>  snps including  <dig> from unplaced scaffolds and  <dig> that had no match on the assembly. on average, there were  <dig>  snps per chromosome, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . this set of snps was chosen as being valid for all four pedigrees; recombination maps were calculated separately for each of them. the rates of phase reconstruction differed for the four pedigrees. for the complete genome, the highest rate was obtained for the uiuc pedigree  and the lowest rate was obtained for the ros pedigree . the ill and usda pedigrees were intermediate with phase reconstruction rates of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

* linkage map lengths are the sex-averaged map lengths, calculated by using all the individuals of the pedigree. **the ratio cm/mb was calculated in bins of  <dig> mb.

the details of the genetic maps calculated for each of the four pedigrees are presented in table
 <dig>  the estimates of the total genetic length of the  <dig> autosomes were  <dig>  cm for ill,  <dig>  cm for uiuc,  <dig>  cm for usda and  <dig>  cm for ros. the largest chromosome was ssc <dig> for ill, uiuc and ros pedigrees with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cm, respectively; whereas it was ssc <dig> for the usda pedigree with  <dig> cm. ssc <dig> was the smallest chromosome for all the pedigrees, its length varying from  <dig> cm for the ros pedigree to  <dig> cm for the uiuc pedigree. estimates of the size of linkage maps are influenced by many factors. recombination events are stochastic and different sub-sets of the markers  are informative in the different pedigrees. although potential genotyping errors were removed from the analysis, specific snps segregating only in particular pedigrees might still result in increased map length if they have a higher error rate. however, our observed difference in size between the ill and uiuc maps versus the usda and ros maps, is consistently seen for most of the chromosomes, indicating a true biological difference in the recombination rate for these different crosses. because within the usda and ros pedigrees female recombination was not well taken into account , male and female recombination maps were described separately only for the ill and uiuc pedigrees . consistent with findings in other mammals, the total lengths were longer for the female maps  than for the male maps . ssc <dig> stands out as an exception, with the male maps being longer than the female maps. this difference is due to a low recombination rate in the females in the region between  <dig> and  <dig> mb . in this 90– <dig> mb region, the average recombination rate in females was  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm/mb for ill and uiuc respectively whereas it was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for males in ill and uiuc pedigrees respectively.

* the ratio cm/mb was calculated in bins of  <dig> mb.

recombination rates
recombination rates were calculated for non-overlapping bins of  <dig> mb with marker positions delimiting the intervals . at the level of the genome, the highest average recombination rate was obtained for the uiuc pedigree with  <dig>  cm/mb, the lowest being obtained for the usda pedigree with  <dig>  cm/mb . this ratio was highly variable depending on the physical length of the chromosomes, the shortest ones having higher ratios than the longest ones .

for the four pedigrees, the highest recombination rate was observed for ssc <dig> with values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm/mb for ill, uiuc, usda and ros, respectively. the lowest recombination rate was obtained on ssc <dig> with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm/mb for ill, uiuc, usda and ros respectively . at the genome level, recombination rates were higher in females than in males. at the chromosome levels, only ssc <dig> displayed higher recombination rates in males than in females, for ill and uiuc pedigrees . the distribution of recombination rates was not constant along the chromosomes with high recombination rates mostly concentrated around the end of the chromosomes . this is seen both in male and female recombination but the effect is somewhat stronger in female recombination. overall, the recombination maps for the  <dig> pedigrees are in good agreement, although small local differences can be detected.

on ssc <dig>  the large gap observed is due to the absence of snps that could be reliably included for the four pedigrees in the genetic maps. the distribution of the recombination rates plotted against the physical distance to the closest chromosome end confirm that high recombination rates tend to cluster around the chromosome ends, irrespective of the position of the centromere . for the sex-averaged map, the correlation between the recombination rate and the physical distance to the closest chromosome end was estimated to be- <dig>  , and correlations for separate male and females maps were identical.

correlation of recombination with sequence parameters
correlations between recombination rates and various sequence parameters  have previously been observed in human
 <cit> , chicken
 <cit> , dog
 <cit>  and mouse
 <cit> . the occurrence of these sequence parameters was calculated within bins of  <dig> mb and the correlations with the recombination rates were estimated. with the sex-average map, all sequence features were highly significantly correlated with the recombination rate . however, the level of the correlations was lower for lines and ltrs, with pearson correlation coefficients of- <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the comparison of the sequence composition of recombination ‘jungles’ and ‘deserts’  also highlights this link between the occurrence of specific sequence features and recombination rate . recombination jungles were enriched in specific gc rich motifs as compared to the deserts. the largest difference was observed for the ccccacccc sequence, this sequence being almost three times more frequent in recombination jungles than in deserts.

columns j and d represent the average composition  of jungle and desert regions respectively. the j/d ratio represents the comparison of these compositions, a value higher than one indicating that the motif is more frequent in jungle than in desert regions.

male and female recombination rates were also analysed separately and large differences were observed. the correlation of the recombination rate with gc content was higher in females  than in males  . in agreement with this is the observation that in females recombination is higher only when the gc content of the region is higher than  <dig>  whereas it is lower for regions where the gc ratio is smaller than  <dig>  .

jungle/desert ratios were also highly different between sexes for sines and short sequence motifs. in females, this ratio reached  <dig>  for the ctcf consensus sequence , whereas it only reached  <dig>  in males.

discussion
genetic maps
the reliability of a recombination map is of major importance for linkage and genome-wide association analyses
 <cit> . the presented recombination maps were computed for four different pedigrees, with a subset of snps being optimal for all of them, finally comprising  <dig>  snps. because only snps for which sequence and rh positions were in agreement were included in the analyses and because the recombination maps confirmed the a priori order, the map presented in this study is expected to be as accurate as possible with currently available data. the map presented in this paper is the densest recombination map ever computed for the porcine genome. until now, the shortest average marker interval on a genetic map was reached by the usda marc map
 <cit>  with an average interval of  <dig>  cm. the large number of snps as well as the high number of informative meiosis included in the present analysis enabled the computation of a high-density recombination map of the porcine genome with a consequent substantial increase in resolution  compared to previous maps. the total length of the genetic map varied between the four pedigrees, from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm, which is smaller than the previously published genetic maps. this decrease in the total length of the map can in part be explained by the lower rate of genotyping errors with snp chip genotyping as compared to microsatellites or rflp genotyping. another factor that contributes to the decreased map size is the fact that male meioses contributed most to the current map, while the usda maps
 <cit>  were based primarily on female meioses. concerning the map computed with gene-associated snps
 <cit> , the sex-averaged genetic maps presented in our study are  <dig> to 45% shorter, if we take into account only the regions covered in both studies
 <cit> . the same is observed for the sex-specific maps. female maps are  <dig> to 33% shorter in our study, and the two male genetic maps are around 18-19% shorter than the one presented by vingborg et al. <cit> . recently, two genetic maps based on the  <dig> k snp chip have been published for landrace and duroc, with similar chromosome lengths as in our study except for ssc <dig> where a length of  <dig>  cm was obtained in landrace, very different from all the others
 <cit> .

recombination rates
the recombination map of the porcine genome described in this paper, revealed major chromosomal as well as regional differences in recombination rates. the four pedigrees clustered into two different groups, ill and uiuc having recombination rates close to  <dig>  cm/mb whereas the two other pedigrees had lower recombination rates close to  <dig>  cm/mb. all these values are in the range of previous findings in mammals . in birds, the observed recombination rate is higher with a value of  <dig>  cm/mb in the zebra finch
 <cit>  and up to  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm/mb in chicken
 <cit> . differences in recombination rate within a species have already been described in mice
 <cit>  and chicken
 <cit> . differences in recombination rate observed in this study among the four pedigrees are partly explained by the percentage of phases that could be reconstructed. a lower number of phases could be reconstructed in the two pedigrees in which family sizes were small  or where several mother genotypes were missing . another potential cause for the observed differences are sequence variations within the individuals used, and in particular structural variants like copy number variants and local inversions. in particular the uiuc and ros crosses involving chinese  and european  breeds which diverged around  <dig> million years ago
 <cit> , are likely to have local inversions that would affect recombination at these positions.

in addition to these differences among the four pedigrees studied, the recombination rate also varied among chromosomes  as well as within chromosomes . the distribution of the recombination rate according to the physical size of the chromosomes obtained with the pig was in agreement with the distributions observed in other mammalian species and birds: shortest chromosomes exhibiting higher recombination rates. this result is in line with the observation of at least one cross-over occurring per meiosis per chromosome
 <cit> . it is noteworthy that for the longest chromosomes in pig, the overall recombination fraction  is much lower than for any other mammalian species for which recombination maps have been developed to date .

the distribution of the recombination rate according to the distance to the closest chromosome end showed that higher recombination rates were mostly observed towards the ends of the pig chromosomes. moreover, the position of the centromere did not seem to influence this distribution: e.g., ssc <dig> is an acrocentric chromosome and the distribution of the recombination rate along this chromosome is very similar to the distribution along metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes . other species with acrocentric chromosomes, such as the dog, show a marked increase in recombination fraction at the medial and centromeric parts of most chromosomes
 <cit> . the general absence of this pattern in the acrocentric chromosomes in pigs raises questions on how and particularly when the pig chromosomes became acrocentric. the evolution of centromere positions can be highly dynamic, and the current apparent disparity between centromere position and recombination rate may hint at a recent shift of the position of the centromere in several pig chromosomes.

in human and rat, recombination rates were also found higher in the telomeric regions and reduced close to the centre of the chromosomes
 <cit> , but this pattern is not as pronounced as in the pig. this preferential distribution of crossing overs at the chromosomal ends is even more striking in zebra finch with long central regions where the recombination rate remains extremely low
 <cit> . however, in the zebra finch, and also in chicken, these telomeric regions of exceptionally high recombination compared to the other parts of the chromosomes seem to be much more confined to the extreme edges of the chromosomes, whereas in the pig these distal regions of high recombination are less pronounced but much greater in size. in some species, however, this particular distribution of recombination rate along a chromosome is not observed. in the mouse, the correlation estimated between recombination rate and the distance to the centre of the chromosome does not differ from the one estimated with respect to the distance to the telomere
 <cit> , which is in agreement with the distribution of the recombination rate estimated from the sex-averaged genetic map
 <cit> . similarly, the plot of the genetic map against the physical map of the bovine genome does not show this sigmoid-like pattern that indicates higher recombination rates at the chromosome ends
 <cit> . what is particularly striking in the pig, is that this elevated recombination towards the ends of the chromosomes is also seen for the acrocentric chromosomes. previous observations in other mammals, were interpreted as that recombination at centromeric regions was low, because recombination would interfere with kinetochore assembly
 <cit>  at the centromers. unless the pig has evolved specific features to overcome such interference, which does not seem to be very likely, other yet unknown structures of mammalian chromosomes underlie these observed differences.

recombination and sequence features
in this study, we show that recombination rates vary with the distance to the closest chromosome end. in human, the gc content was negatively correlated with the distance to the chromosome end
 <cit> , and the porcine genome exhibits the same negative correlation. the gc content has also been shown to be strongly positively correlated with recombination rates in human
 <cit> , mice
 <cit> , chicken
 <cit>  and zebra finch
 <cit> , and this was also confirmed in this study. this seemingly universal positive correlation between gc content and recombination is thought to signify a shared underlying mechanism determining recombination rates
 <cit> , although it has been proposed that higher gc content can conversely be the result of high recombination rate
 <cit> .

mechanisms explaining the direct relationship between gc content and recombination rate identify the presence of certain recognition motifs for dna binding proteins that have a known function in meiosis or the recombination process directly, such as cohesin and pr domain-containing protein  <dig>  in other mammalian and avian species, high-density linkage maps have shown strong correlations between recombination rates and various sequences such as the consensus cohesion binding site; the 7-nucleotide oligomer cctccct
 <cit>  and a 13-nucleotide oligomer described in human ccnccntnnccnc
 <cit> . recently, it was shown that this 13-nucleotide sequence is recognized in vitro by the human pr domain-containing protein  <dig>  encoded by the prdm <dig> gene
 <cit> . the pr domain-containing protein  <dig> is known to regulate recombination hotspot activity in human
 <cit> . gc-rich motifs have been investigated in this study and all of them are overrepresented in recombination jungles and underrepresented in deserts. the sequences cctccct and ccccacccc, overrepresented in about 10% of human hotspots
 <cit>  are also correlated with higher recombination rates in mouse and chicken, jungle/desert ratios being close to  <dig> or higher. the same is observed in this study with a ratio close to  <dig> or higher .

sex-differences
in our study, male and female maps were analysed separately for the ill and uiuc pedigrees. in both designs, female meioses were better sampled than in the two other pedigrees for which dams were not always genotyped or had too few offspring. the ros and usda maps are thus closer to male maps that can be explained by their shorter lengths as compared to the sex-average maps of ill and uiuc. it should also be noted that the length of the female maps that are reported here are close to the original marc map that was based primarily on female meioses
 <cit> .

in most species, the heterogametic sex is expected to have a lower recombination rate than the homogametic sex
 <cit> . this was confirmed in this study at the level of the genome with female maps being longer than male maps by 26% or 46% for ill and uiuc pedigrees, respectively. however, ssc <dig> stood out with more recombination events described within males than within females. as shown in figure
 <dig>  females displayed a  <dig> mb region with a very low recombination frequency. vingborg et al. <cit>  found that ssc <dig> was longer in females than in males, but the 70– <dig> cm region of ssc <dig> also displayed higher recombination in males than in females
 <cit> . the greater genetic length of ssc <dig> in males as compared to females was already observed in previous pig genetic maps
 <cit> . all these previous maps were based on crosses between genetically diverse founder/grandparental animals including wild boars and european commercial breeds
 <cit>  and chinese and european breeds
 <cit>  or combinations thereof
 <cit> . the current study also included highly diverse pedigree origins, which makes breed effects therefore unlikely to be the major explanation for this locally low recombination rate. for the ill pedigree, we observed a small difference between the male and female maps of ssc <dig> and this was also reported by guo et al. <cit>  who observed a female to male ratio of  <dig>  for this chromosome. in the linkage map computed with gene-associated snps, ssc <dig> was also found to be rather similar in males and females
 <cit> . for this chromosome, we did not observe such large sex-differences in the distribution of the recombination rates along the chromosome as for ssc <dig>  to better understand this apparent discrepancy in recombination rates between male and female on different chromosomes, we plotted the recombination rates as a function of gc content for male and female separately . although in both sexes higher average recombination frequencies were observed for regions exhibiting a higher gc content, this correlation was much greater in females than in males. this also explains why, contrary to what is observed in most other mammals
 <cit> , there is a tendency of females to show even more elevated recombination towards the ends of the chromosomes than the males. in fact, males showed a clear lower recombination rate at at rich regions, but females showed an even lower recombination at at rich regions relative to males. this resulted in an overall lower recombination rate in females in at rich regions than observed in males. this may explain the observation on ssc <dig>  where the recombination was higher in males due to the 90– <dig> mb region being relatively at rich . this effect was only clearly observed on ssc <dig> since the other chromosomes lack such long regions of low gc content. a positive correlation between recombination rates in female and gc content had already been reported in human
 <cit> , and this was confirmed in the present analysis . recombination in males appeared to be less sensitive to the frequency of the gc rich motifs and the observed jungle / desert ratios are much higher in females.

the positive relationship between gc content and female recombination does not appear to be universal. sex-specific gc related recombination rates for instance have been observed in dogs, but appears to be opposite in this species: higher gc content appears to be negatively correlated with female recombination rate
 <cit> . since the study on dog recombination did not dissect the precise relationship of male and female recombination rates as a function of gc content as done in the present study it is difficult to compare the results. however, this opposite relationship in dogs may hint at specific recombination mechanisms that apply to acrocentric vs. metacentric karyotypes, and demonstrates the importance of having detailed recombination maps for many different species for comparative genome biology purposes.

even if the mechanisms underlying sex differences in recombination are largely unknown, a number of mechanisms for sex-specific differences have been proposed: difference in time allotted for so called bouquet formation in meiosis
 <cit> , difference in the compactness of the chromosomes at pachytene phase of meiosis
 <cit> , genomic imprinting
 <cit> , or differences in the use of specific recombination-hotspot specific motifs
 <cit> . for instance, it has been shown that different alleles of the rnf <dig> gene can have opposite effects on male and female recombination rate
 <cit> . in mice, a qtl analysis was carried out to detect regions of the genome underlying recombination rate and the most significant qtls were observed on chromosome x
 <cit> . this raises the possibility that chromosomes x and/or y may be involved in the observed striking difference of recombination rates between males and females. however, the analysis included only males, so no sex-specific qtl could be analysed. this study in mice indicated that genomic variations on the x chromosome influenced the recombination rate, but it did not provide further explanation of why females recombine more than males. finally, in mice, the analysis of meiocytes from xx females, xy males, xy sex-reversed and xo females indicated that recombination patterns depend more on being a male or a female than on the true chromosomal genotype
 <cit> . all of these mechanisms may be compatible with the patterns observed in the present paper. in fact, the evolution of recombination and recombination hotspots seems highly dynamic, and may involve universal  and species specific mechanisms . the importance of each of these mechanisms will need to be tested for various species using higher density linkage maps in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present the first high-density recombination map of the porcine genome, with a resolution substantially higher than previously published maps. this high resolution enabled us to focus on the differences between low and high- recombining regions of the genome, and on the large differences that we observed between males and females. as expected, at the genome level, female maps were longer than male maps. the unexpected higher recombination rates in males observed on ssc <dig>  could be explained by a large region of low gc content where females showed very low recombination rates. the higher correlation between recombination rate and gc content  in females as compared to males was confirmed at the genome level. until now, this high correlation between recombination rates in females and gc content has only been reported in human. further analyses of the mechanisms underlying recombination are needed to identify the molecular mechanism underlying this observed difference. the increased insight into the porcine recombination landscape will help future studies aimed at understanding the evolution of the pig genome and at fine-mapping identified qtls for economically important traits.
