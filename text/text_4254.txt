BACKGROUND
among many trophic factors that act on sensory neurons, three have been studied extensively: nerve growth factor , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor  and brain-derived neurotrophic factor . during development, ngf, gdnf and bdnf, along with neurotrophin- <dig> , support the survival of subpopulations of sensory neurons through their cognate trk receptors  <cit> . in the adult, uninjured rat, receptors for ngf, gdnf and bdnf are found in partially distinct subpopulations of sensory neurons. ngf-responsive, trka-containing neurons are mostly small diameter, contain the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide , and are generally thought to have nociceptive properties  <cit> . the bdnf-responsive, trkb-containing population of sensory neurons is predominantly larger diameter and mechanosensitive  <cit> , although there is considerable overlap with the trka population  <cit> . gdnf receptors are more widespread, with as many as 60% of dorsal root ganglion  neurons containing c-ret, while gfr components are found throughout the c-ret population, as well as in c-ret negative neurons  <cit> . additionally, sensory neurons that are postnatally dependent on gdnf for survival bind the isolectin b <dig> .

ngf is thought to play a primary role in the development and maintenance of several pro-algesic states. ngf produces sensitization of nociceptive responses in vivo and increases responsiveness to chemical stimuli associated with nociceptive neurotransmission in vitro  <cit> . ngf increases the expression of the pro-inflammatory neuropeptide cgrp  <cit>  and increases substance p  and cgrp content in sensory neurons  <cit> . ngf also promotes the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia following chronic constriction injury  <cit> . additionally, ngf increases capsaicin  sensitivity both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . in accordance with this increased cap sensitivity, ngf increases the expression of the cap- and noxious heat-sensitive ion channel vanilloid receptor type  <dig>  through the ras/p <dig> map kinase signaling pathway, thereby promoting thermal hyperalgesia  <cit> . additionally, ngf has recently been shown to modulate trpv <dig> by releasing the receptor from phosphotidylinositol- <dig> -bisphosphate-mediated inhibition  <cit> .

gdnf also plays a role in modulating nociceptive processing, but with contrasting in vitro and in vivo effects. in cultured drg neurons, gdnf increases cap sensitivity and trpv <dig> expression  <cit>  and increases neuropeptide content  <cit> . on the other hand, intrathecal injection of gdnf has no effect on c-fiber evoked outflow of sp and does not induce thermal hyperalgesia, while ngf does both  <cit> . this, coupled with the observation that gdnf-overexpressing mice do not develop thermal or mechanical hypersensitivity  <cit> , suggests that gdnf might not lead to nociceptor sensitization in vivo. in fact, in nerve injured rats, gdnf has antihyperalgesic effects  <cit>  and promotes the functional regeneration of drg-spinal cord connections  <cit> . it is not understood how this dissociation of the in vitro and in vivo effects of gdnf is manifested.

inflammation and nerve injury both increase bdnf content in drg neurons and in the spinal cord, and this increase in bdnf is associated with the maintenance of a hyperalgesic state  <cit> . furthermore, bdnf is released in the spinal cord upon noxious afferent stimulation  <cit> , and peripheral cap application increases bdnf release at central terminals of sensory neurons  <cit> . hence, bdnf might act as a neurotransmitter in the pain pathway in adult animals  <cit> . the trophic properties of bdnf on adult sensory neurons, particularly nociceptors, are poorly understood.

in addition to cap, a number of other trpv <dig> agonists have been described. among these are compounds that are also cannabinoid receptor agonists, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide . aea causes antinociception in vivo through central  <cit>  and peripheral mechanisms  <cit> . it is not known, though, whether the endogenous production of aea can reach sufficient concentrations under pathophysiological states to act as an endogenous activator of trpv <dig>  one potential mechanism whereby growth factors could contribute to the development of nociceptor sensitization is through the modulation of the efficacy or potency of aea at trpv <dig> thus, growth factors might unmask conditions under which aea could be capable of functioning as an endogenously produced trpv <dig> agonist, potentially leading to neurogenic inflammation and thermal hyperalgesia.

the aim of the present work was to gain a more precise understanding of ngf-, gdnf- and bdnf-dependent alterations of cultured tg sensory neuron survival and phenotype, with attention to markers and functions that are related to nociception. furthermore, by relating these findings to neurosecretion associated with pharmacological stimulation of trpv <dig>  we hope to present a rationale for differences in how these neurotrophins might contribute to altered nociception at the level of the tg sensory neuron. moreover, there is a gap in knowledge concerning neurotrophic factor influence over tg neurons, as the vast majority of our understanding of how neurotrophins alter sensory neurons stems from studies of the drg. the recent advances of cgrp receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine  <cit>  raises the possibility that manipulations which influence cgrp expression and/or secretion might be beneficial in the treatment of migraine or conditions related to the cerebral vasculature. a fuller understanding of the impact of ngf, gdnf and bdnf on tg neurochemical properties has the potential to lead to novel therapeutic strategies concerning disease states involving neuropeptide secretion in the trigeminal system, such as migraine.

RESULTS
effects of ngf, gdnf or bdnf treatment on neuronal survival in vitro
tg neuronal cultures were plated at equal densities  on 8-well culture slides . after five days of growth factor treatment, immunocytochemistry  for  <dig> kd neurofilament  present in all sensory neurons  <cit>  and not other ganglion cells , was performed to determine the number of neurons in each well. representative photomicrographs are shown in figure  <dig>  ngf did not significantly influence the number of neurons in culture following five days of treatment . on the other hand, gdnf significantly enhanced the number of neurons per well versus no growth factor treated cultures at both  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml . the enhanced neuronal survival seen with gdnf was biphasic, as  <dig> ng/ml gdnf did not significantly enhance neuronal survival. it should be noted that in gdnf-treated cultures we observed a robust sprouting of tg neurons, appearing far more robust than in ngf- or bdnf-treated cultures .

effects of ngf, gdnf or bdnf treatment on trpv <dig> mrna and protein levels
to directly assess changes in trpv <dig> mrna levels with growth factor treatment, quantitative, realtime pcr was conducted. ngf, gdnf or bdnf  did not significantly alter trpv <dig> mrna levels after  <dig> days of treatment . to evaluate whether growth factor treatment might exert post-transcriptional regulation of trpv <dig> gene expression, we next examined their effects on trpv <dig> protein levels by western blot. as shown in fig.  <dig>  a major band was detected with the trpv <dig> antibody at ~ <dig> kd, consistent with the glycosylated form of trpv <dig>  <cit> . ngf and gdnf  each was demonstrated to have increased trpv <dig> protein levels by approximately 50% compared with no growth factor-treated cultures . bdnf effects on trpv <dig> protein levels were not assessed, because preliminary studies indicated that bdnf did not influence cap-evoked cgrp release.

effects of ngf, gdnf or bdnf treatment on k+-evoked cgrp release and cgrp content
we next examined the effect of growth factor treatment on k+-evoked cgrp release and total cgrp content in tg neuronal cultures. ngf treatment significantly and concentration-dependently increased  <dig> mm k+-evoked cgrp release at every concentration, peaking  at  <dig> ng/ml . similarly, gdnf significantly and concentration-dependently increased k+- evoked release at every concentration, again peaking  at  <dig> ng/ml. on the other hand, bdnf did not alter k -evoked cgrp release.

because there were differences in neuron numbers between growth factor conditions, we examined under each condition the proportion of neurons that were positive for cgrp, trpv <dig> or ib <dig>  representative photomicrographs for each of these conditions are shown in figure  <dig>  the proportion of neurons positive for cgrp, trpv <dig> or ib <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  in no cases were cgrp- or trpv1-immunoreactive or ib4-binding neurons not likewise immunoreactive for nf-h. we then utilized the proportion of cgrp-expressing neurons under ngf, gdnf or bdnf treatment conditions to normalize k+- evoked cgrp release to the number of cgrp-immunoreactive neurons under each condition, respectively . following this transformation, ngf treatment still augmented k+-evoked cgrp release at every concentration tested, with the magnitude of the effect reaching  <dig> times that of control . while gdnf treatment again enhanced k+-evoked cgrp release at all concentrations following normalization, its peak effect was relatively lower. bdnf treatment continued not to have an effect following normalization to the number of cgrp-immunoreactive neurons.

much like k+-evoked cgrp release, total cgrp content was increased significantly by ngf and gdnf treatment, while bdnf had no effect . both ngf and gdnf increased cgrp content concentration-dependently at every concentration , with peaks at  <dig> ng/ml  for ngf and  <dig> ng/ml  for gdnf . again, we normalized these data to cgrp-immunoreactive neurons to assess changes in relation to alterations in cgrp-immunoreactive neurons between the growth factor conditions. interestingly, the gdnf augmentation of cgrp release appeared to be due primarily to the large increases in neuron survival, because only the  <dig> ng/ml gdnf condition was significantly greater than control , but still substantial lower compared with the untransformed lysis figures . on the other hand, normalization led to a further augmention in the effect of ngf on total cgrp content, up to a  <dig> -fold increase. bdnf treatment did not alter the normalized cgrp content.

effects of ngf, gdnf or bdnf treatment on cap-evoked cgrp release
to assess the effect of growth factor supplementation on the neurosecretory function of nociceptors in culture, we evaluated cap-evoked cgrp release. treatment with  <dig> nm cap for  <dig> min led to a significant enhancement of cgrp release over baseline under all conditions. treatment of cultures with ngf or gdnf resulted in a concentration-dependent enhancement of this effect, with significant increases in cap-evoked cgrp release at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml. bdnf also enhanced the ability of cap to evoke cgrp release; however, the effect was only seen at the  <dig> ng/ml concentration. in every case, gdnf and ngf  supplementation significantly enhanced cap-evoked cgrp release over the same concentration of bdnf .

to determine to what extent the enhancement of cap-evoked cgrp release in response to growth factor treatment might derive from increased neuronal survival and/or up-regulation in the proportion of neurons expressing trpv <dig>  release data were normalized to the number of trpv1-immunoreactive neurons . in this case, ngf treatment still significantly increased cap-evoked cgrp release over no growth factor treatment at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml. however, this normalization procedure led to a relative reduction in the gdnf effect on cap-evoked cgrp release, such that only the  <dig> ng/ml condition reached a significant increase in cgrp outflow. after normalization, bdnf treatment had no significant effect on cap-evoked cgrp release at  <dig> or  <dig> ng/ml and actually reduced the amount of release at  <dig> ng/ml. moreover, following normalization, ngf-treated neurons displayed a significantly higher cgrp release than either gdnf- or bdnf-treated neurons at every concentration of growth factor tested .

because treatment with either gdnf or ngf induced a large increase in  <dig> nm cap-evoked cgrp release, we assessed the effect of supplementation with these growth factors on the receptor pharmacodynamics of this response compared with no growth factor supplementation. gdnf or ngf treatment significantly increased the hill slope of the concentration-response function from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the no growth factor condition to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for  <dig> ng/ml ngf and to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for  <dig> ng/ml gdnf  but had no effect on the ec <dig> . gdnf  or ngf  treatment caused a significant, five-fold increase in the emax of the cap concentration-response curve . a common feature of cap concentration-response functions is that they frequently exhibit an inverted u-shape, likely attributable to trpv <dig> desensitization at higher concentrations. thus, whereas the concentration-response function in the absence of growth factor displayed desensitization only at  <dig> um, that for either gdnf- and ngf-treated tg cultures showed desensitization of the cap-evoked cgrp response at concentrations above  <dig> nm .

effects of ngf, gdnf or bdnf treatment on aea- and acea-evoked cgrp release
to test whether growth factor-mediated enhancement of neuropeptide release might be generalizable to other trpv <dig> secretagogues, we evaluated the dual cannabinoid-vanilloid agonists aea and acea. as in the case with cap, the effects of aea and acea on evoked cgrp release were augmented by supplementation of tg cultures with ngf  or gdnf . while tg neurons not treated with growth factors were largely unresponsive to aea or acea, in terms of cgrp release, treatment of cultures with either ngf or gdnf for  <dig> days at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> ng/ml caused a concentration-dependent increase in cgrp release evoked by  <dig> μm aea or acea. furthermore, the estimated ec <dig> values for each of the individual growth factors to increase evoked cgrp release were equivalent for cap, aea and acea . in contrast, bdnf supplementation did not augment aea- or acea-evoked cgrp release, while a small, yet significant, increase in cap-evoked cgrp release was observed with increasing bdnf concentration . when tg neurons were supplemented with either  <dig> ng/ml ngf or gdnf, the emax and ec <dig> values for aea did not change ) ; however, when compared with non-growth factor-treated tg neurons, the emax was significantly augmented .

discussion
this study demonstrates that ngf, gdnf and bdnf differentially influence neuronal survival, neuropeptide content and stimulated secretion of tg neurons in culture. gdnf significantly augments tg neuronal survival, while both ngf and gdnf modulate cap sensitivity, and alter the pharmacodynamics of the concentration-response function for cap-evoked cgrp release. furthermore, ngf and gdnf increased the releasable pool and total content of cgrp while increasing trpv <dig> protein, without increasing its mrna. these data support the hypothesis that gdnf and ngf, but not bdnf, alter cap sensitivity in cultured tg neurons, and taken together, suggest that the differential effects of ngf and gdnf in vitro may reflect their differential effects in vivo, particularly with regard to trpv1-mediated nociception.

gdnf, but not ngf or bdnf significantly increased the number of neurons present in tg culture  <dig> days post-plating. the finding that this effect of gdnf was biphasic, as the  <dig> ng/ml concentration did not enhance the number of neurons in tg culture, suggests the possible involvement of different receptors with different concentrations of gdnf. multiple receptors exist in the gdnf receptor family, and they function in concert with the protein c-ret. gdnf binds most readily to gfr alpha- <dig>  but also binds to gfr alpha- <dig> / c-ret heterodimers  <cit> . gfr alpha- <dig> and - <dig> are expressed in sensory ganglia and are found mostly in ib4-binding neurons  <cit>  that also contain c-ret  <cit> . notably, it has been suggested that gfr alpha- <dig> and gfr alpha-2-containing neurons in the adult rat make up two distinct populations in the drg within the ib4-binding class  <cit> ; hence, the effects observed here may be due to gdnf acting through its high affinity gfr alpha- <dig> site at the  <dig> ng/ml concentration and through either or both gfr alpha- <dig> and gfr alpha- <dig> / c-ret, for which it has a lower affinity, at the  <dig> ng/ml concentration. while the observation here that gdnf promotes survival is a novel finding for rat tg sensory neurons in primary culture, the neuroprotective effects of gdnf are well documented. gdnf is protective against the loss of dopaminergic neurons in animal models of parkinson's disease  <cit> , and gdnf reduces the number of apoptotic bodies in drg explants from adult mice  <cit> . gdnf also rescues the reduction of p2x <dig> expression that occurs in the drg following axotomy  <cit> .

although bdnf and ngf did not significantly increase the number of tg neurons in culture, we did observe a significant, linear trend for increased neuron survival as a function of increasing bdnf concentrations, an observation not present in ngf-treated tg cultures. hence, bdnf and gdnf both promoted the survival of tg neurons in vitro. primary cultures generated here were grown in the presence of mitotic inhibitors, which greatly reduce the supportive glial cells and the trophic factors they normally provide tg neurons in the native ganglia . removal of astroglial support promotes apoptosis in cerebral neuronal cultures, an effect which is reversed by addition of gdnf or bdnf, but not ngf, to the culture medium  <cit> . the addition of gdnf or bdnf to the culture medium here may have re-supplied, at least partially, the withdrawn glial-supplied trophic factors that maintain sensory neurons in vivo, thereby increasing the number of neurons in culture at  <dig> days. it should be noted, however, that despite the significant effects of the growth factors observed in this study on neuronal survival, from an original density of nearly  <dig>  neurons / well in the original culture homogenate, only about 10% of neurons could be counted at  <dig> days post-platting, in the control condition. a maximum of just over 20% were counted in the  <dig> ng/ml gdnf treated tg cultures. therefore, it stands to reason that gdnf and bdnf are supporting the survival of certain classes of sensory neurons that are not supported either without growth factors or with ngf alone.

the proportions of tg neurons in culture that expressed cgrp- or trpv1-immunoreactivity or ib4-binding sites were assessed with attention to how these proportions changed in the presence of ngf, gdnf and bdnf. notably, the proportion of sensory neurons in vitro that expressed cgrp  was much larger than the known proportion of cgrp-containing neurons in native tg . this likely indicates that the culturing process conditions are either selectively preserving peptidergic neurons or that normally non-peptidergic neurons novelly express cgrp in culture. on the other hand, discrepancies on reports of the percentage of ib4-binding neurons in native tg, ranging from ~35–60%  <cit>  make it difficult to assess whether there is an increased proportion of ib4-binding neurons in culture; however, our data indicate that this proportion is at least in the upper range, if not greater than native tg. furthermore, a probable significant overlap exists between cgrp-immunoreactive and ib4-binding neuronal populations observed here, as both were found in the majority of tg neurons in culture, in agreement with the demonstration that these populations overlap significantly in native, adult rat tg and drg .

we observed that a greater proportion of trpv1-immunoreactive neurons were present with gdnf supplementation , again indicating either that gdnf preferentially supports the survival of trpv1-expressing sensory neurons or that neurons that do not normally express trpv <dig> begin expressing trpv <dig> when gdnf is included in the culture medium. the latter proposition is supported by the finding that peripheral treatment with anti-gdnf antibodies suppresses the novel expression of trpv <dig> in ib4-binding neurons following peripheral inflammation  <cit> . the percentage of trpv1-expressing neurons in tg cultures not treated with growth factors was essentially equivalent to the percentage in native tg  <cit> . this finding indicates that, not only does gdnf promote survival of tg neurons in culture, but also enriches for trpv1-expressing neurons, suggesting that gdnf might be preferentially neuroprotective for sensory neurons in adult animals that express trpv <dig> 

we have also illustrated that chronic application of ngf or gdnf, but not bdnf , increases cap-evoked cgrp release from tg neurons in vitro. ngf and gdnf each increased trpv <dig> protein, and both upregulated the cgrp content of tg neurons. both the ngf- and gdnf-induced upregulation of trpv <dig> appears to be translationally regulated, as neither of these growth factors altered trpv <dig> mrna levels. ngf, in the setting of inflammation, is known to increase trpv <dig> protein, but not mrna, through activation of the p38/map kinase pathway  <cit> , and ngf-mediated upregulation of trpv <dig> is blocked by over-expression of dominant-negative ras  <cit> . interestingly, the study by bron et al.  indicated that gdnf is also able to upregulate trpv <dig> expression; although this conclusion was based on immunofluorescence and cobalt uptake assays, it is consistent with our direct demonstration of gdnf-induced upregulation of trpv <dig> protein by western blot. after normalization to the number of neurons that express trpv <dig> and cgrp, we found that ngf had a much greater effect on cap-evoked cgrp release and neuropeptide content, on a per cell basis, than did gdnf. on the other hand, gdnf increased the proportion of neurons in culture that express trpv <dig>  such that gdnf-maintained cultures contained a higher number of trpv1-expressing neurons compared with ngf-maintained cultures. hence, our findings suggest that ngf increases cap responsiveness in individual cultured tg neurons. on the other hand, gdnf appears to increase the responsiveness of the in vitro population by altering the proportion of trpv <dig> neurons and upregulating the releasable pool of cgrp, as evidenced by the persistent increase in  <dig> mm k+-evoked cgrp release after normalization. this difference in the ability of gdnf and ngf to enhance individual neuronal neuropeptide content and cap responsiveness could partially explain why ngf induces hyperalgesia  <cit>  while gdnf does not  <cit> . our findings suggest that while gdnf might play a role in maintaining cap sensitivity in vitro, its effects in vivo might be of a preservative nature that prevents the development of pain exacerbation following experimental manipulation. furthermore, ngf and gdnf might differentially/predominantly subserve two of the main physiologic processes following injury: hyperalgesia to protect the organism from further injury  and regeneration/repair to restore function .

while it has been shown, using a variety of dependent measures, that both ngf and gdnf increase cap responsiveness  <cit> , this is the first demonstration that these growth factors qualitatively alter the pharmacodynamics of the neuronal response to cap in tg neurons. the increase in the hill slope of the cap response following exposure to ngf or gdnf indicates that these growth factors induce positive cooperativity, possible at the level of trpv <dig>  while the mechanism underlying this effect is not known, it could involve an alteration in post-translational modifications and/or protein interactions of trpv <dig> in response to ngf or gdnf. ngf or gdnf also decreased the concentration of cap necessary to induce tachyphylaxsis compared with control cultures. these findings indicate that trpv1-mediated sensory neuron desensitization might be a more efficacious therapeutic strategy in pathologies known to be associated with increased levels of ngf and/or gdnf. while we are unaware of any data linking gdnf with migraine, increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of ngf are associated with chronic headache  <cit> . interestingly, a trpv <dig> targeted approach has been utilized in a clinical trial for migraine treatment in which intranasal civamide  was shown to be effective for acute treatment of migraine  <cit> , indicating that trpv <dig> agonists might be employed in this condition, possibly to desensitize cgrp-containing tg nerve endings.

similarly to cap-evoked cgrp release, the ability of aea and acea to evoke release was concentration-dependently augmented by ngf or gdnf supplementation but was unaltered by bdnf. moreover, the respective potencies of ngf and gdnf to enhance the cgrp release in response to cap, aea and acea were equivalent. this suggests that the pharmacology of cap, aea and acea at trpv <dig>  at least with respect to neuropeptide secretion, is similarly regulated in the presence of either of these growth factors. insofar as ngf and gdnf have been implicated in the development of nociceptor sensitization in a number of pathological states, it should be considered that endocanninoids are apt to have enhanced trpv1-mediated peripheral neuromodulatory effects under these conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results illustrate that ngf, gdnf and bdnf differentially alter sensory neuron survival, neurochemical properties and trpv1-mediated neuropeptide release of tg neurons in culture. gdnf and, to a lesser extent, bdnf promote survival of tg neurons and gdnf enhances the proportion of neurons that exhibit trpv1-immunoreactivity. gdnf or ngf enhanced cap-, aea- and acea-evoked cgrp release from tg neurons in vitro and increased trpv <dig> protein, likely through translational regulation, and overall cgrp content. on the other hand, our findings suggest that gdnf and ngf differentially modulate trpv1-mediated neuropeptide secretion sensitivity, with ngf having a much greater effect on a per neuron basis, providing a possible explanation for why ngf promotes thermal hypersensitivity in vivo while gdnf apparently does not. although the present studies were conducted on cultured neurons under artificially controlled conditions, these findings contribute to a growing body of work concerning neurotrophin modulation of the properties of nociceptors. thus the results described here have implications for advancing our understanding of how this system might be advantageously manipulated in a therapeutic setting especially as it concerns the tg system.
