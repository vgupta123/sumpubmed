BACKGROUND
oligonucleotide microarray technology is a powerful application to measure genome-wide changes in mrna expression levels in various tissue samples or cell lines. in most studies of tissue samples, whole tissue homogenates were used for rna isolation. however, use of whole tissue homogenates unavoidably results in averaging of expression levels of different cell types present in the tissue. the expression profile of the cell type of interest will therefore be masked or even lost because of the surrounding cells. to circumvent this problem laser microdissection microscopy  has become an important tool since it allows isolation of pure cell populations from heterogeneous tissue  <cit> . the disadvantage of ldm is the low yield of rna. currently, a wide range of amplification protocols has been developed to increase the amount of rna for microarray approaches  <cit> . the most widely accepted and used protocol for microarray approaches is the t <dig> rna-polymerase based linear antisense rna amplification protocol  <cit> . whereas total rna from whole tissue samples is often amplified one round before hybridization, a second round of amplification is generally performed on total rna isolated from ldm samples to yield sufficient rna for microarray approaches.

there is ongoing discussion on the effect of a second round of amplification on the reliability of microarray data. it is known that the amplification procedure can introduce a bias by truncating the length of the amplified transcripts due to inefficient cdna synthesis. in addition, a second round of cdna synthesis can result in further truncation of the 5' ends of the transcripts, due to random priming at internal sites for the second strand synthesis  <cit> . however, reproducible results on microarrays were described with application of additional rounds of amplification on low amounts of rna obtained after microdissection  <cit> . in addition, the effects of an additional round of amplification on gene expression profiles have been reported to be minor on the basis of high pearson correlation coefficients of all genes  between one and two rounds of amplification  <cit>  and of consistent numbers of differentially expressed genes detected between one and two rounds of amplification  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the bias of a second round of amplification on microarray results by comparing two rounds of amplification with one round using the agilent whole human genome platform. in more detail, we compared the differentially expressed genes identified after both amplification methods. we hypothesized that due to further truncation of rna during the second round of amplification, a number of differentially expressed genes remains undetected when the corresponding microarray probes are designed too far from the starting point of amplification, the poly-tail. to test this hypothesis, we investigated this probe – poly-tail effect on the identification of genes differentially expressed between two microdissected tissue samples after two rounds of amplification in comparison to genes differentially expressed after one round of amplification. quantitative rt-pcr  was used to validate the differential expression of a selection of these genes on unamplified total rna from the same microdissected tissue samples.

RESULTS
rna isolation and amplification
an area of  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> of tumor cells was microdissected from the tumor sample and  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> of bronchial epithelial cells was microdissected from the bronchus. a quantity of  <dig> ng of total rna was isolated from the microdissected tumor cells and  <dig> ng from the bronchial epithelial cells. rna quality was sufficient for both samples . the average yield of amplified rna  after a single round of amplification with a 100-ng input of total rna was  <dig>   μg arna. from the samples undergoing two rounds of amplification, an input of  <dig> ng total rna was used for the 1st round, resulting in an average of  <dig>   μg arna. according to the manufacturer's instructions  <dig> μg arna was used for the 2nd round of amplification, which yielded an average of  <dig>  μg arna. to assess the size of the arna after one and two rounds of amplification, we analyzed part of the amplified products on agarose gel . as expected, we observed a marked reduction in size of the arna after two rounds of amplification.

low agreement between one and two rounds of amplification
principal component analysis  was applied to identify factors that explain the most important variations between our  <dig> datasets. the first principal component explained  <dig> % of the total variance, caused by the commonly observed technical variation between hybridizations. after this variance was subtracted, the largest retained components were visualized in a three-dimensional plot . the 2nd principal component, which explains  <dig> % of the total variance, was explained by the difference between tumor and bronchus. the 3rd component  was explained by the number of amplification rounds. the 4th component  was explained by the difference in cy-dye label. the subsequent components, less than 1%, could not be explained by a known factor. unsupervised clustering of the  <dig> individual datasets showed the same chronological clusters as found with pca, that is, the largest difference was between tumor and bronchus and the second difference was between the two amplification procedures .

bland and altman plots of the duplicate tumor datasets yielded after one and two rounds of amplification showed a large variability in datasets between these two different amplification methods, with wide 95%-limits of agreement of - <dig>  to  <dig>  . as a comparison, the control graphs illustrated a much smaller variability within the same amplification method and much narrower 95%-limits of agreement of - <dig>  to  <dig> . we observed no clear systematic biases between the two methods. the bradley-blackwood f test revealed highly significant differences  between the datasets of one and two rounds of amplification. the bradley-blackwood f test also revealed a highly significant difference  between the datasets of the same amplification method. this expected significant difference is in line with the large variability of the first principal component explained by the technical variation commonly observed between microarray hybridizations . a high average pearson correlation coefficient of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  was calculated between one and two rounds of amplification, which is comparable to previous studies  <cit> . the concordance correlation revealed a very low average correlation coefficient between the datasets of one and two rounds of amplification  indicating a very low agreement between the two amplification methods. in contrast, the concordance correlation within the same amplification method revealed much higher average coefficients, and thus a much higher agreement .

inconsistency in differentially expressed genes between one and two rounds of amplification
differentially expressed genes after one round of amplification were selected at a cut-off level of two times the standard deviation   according to the formulas described in methods.  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were identified after one round of amplification and  <dig>  after two rounds.  <dig> of these genes  were identified as differentially expressed genes for both amplification approaches. application of more stringent cut-off levels revealed an average consistency of  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes between one and two rounds of amplification at a cut-off level of 3×sd  and 4×sd  respectively. this means that up to 30% of the differentially expressed genes differ between one and two rounds of amplification.

loss of differentially expressed genes due to long probe – poly-tail distance
we investigated if the further truncation of rna molecules after the second round of amplification can explain the discrepancy observed between genes differentially expressed in one and two rounds of amplification. therefore, we determined the distance of the  <dig> mer-oligos  on the agilent whg array to the poly-tail of the corresponding genes . the  <dig>  determined probe – poly-tail distances showed a large variation in distance, with a range from  <dig> to  <dig>  nucleotides  and a median distance of  <dig> nt . for the  <dig>  genes differentially expressed after one round of amplification,  <dig> probe – poly-tail distances were determined. these  <dig> probe – poly-tail distances showed a range from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt with a median of  <dig> nt, which was significantly different from the probe – poly-tail distances of all genes  . for the  <dig>  genes differentially expressed after two rounds of amplification,  <dig> probe – poly-tail distances were determined. these  <dig> probe – poly-tail distances showed a range from  <dig> to  <dig>  and a median of  <dig> nt, which was significantly different from the probe – poly-tail distances of all genes  and of differentially expressed genes after one round .

 <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes identified after one round were not identified as being differentially expressed after two rounds . these  <dig> inconsistent genes showed a significant longer probe – poly-tail distance as compared to the remaining  <dig> consistent differentially expressed genes  .

validation of differentially expressed genes by quantitative rt-pcr
ten of the  <dig> inconsistent genes  with a probe – poly-tail distance of more than  <dig> nt were selected for validation with qrt-pcr. qrt-pcr was performed on unamplified microdissected total rna to verify if these genes were truly differentially expressed between tumor and bronchus . as a control, another  <dig> genes with a probe – poly-tail distance of over  <dig> nt were selected that were consistent differentially expressed for both one and two rounds . on average, genes from both amplification groups had comparable probe – poly-tail distances . the relative expression levels of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes showed an up- or down regulation of genes between tumor and bronchus in agreement with the results of the microarray data . two genes, ncoa <dig> and b2m, showed a similar expression level in tumor and bronchus .

loss of overall signal intensity after two rounds of amplification due to long probe – poly-tail distance
we investigated if a long probe – poly-tail distance negatively influences the overall signal intensity of genes after two rounds of amplification. an illustrating graph of this influence is shown in figure  <dig>  we observed a negative regression coefficient for both t and b samples that were significantly different from zero , which indicates that an increase in probe – poly-tail distance results in a decreased signal intensity after two rounds of amplification.

discussion
the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a second round of t7-rna polymerase-based amplification, specifically on the identification of differentially expressed genes, using agilent whole human genome platform. we found that prolonged probe – poly-tail distances are related to a linear decrease in signal intensity. moreover, we demonstrate a loss of 30% of truly differentially expressed genes after a second round of rna amplification.

a clear difference between one and two rounds of amplification was found by several statistical tests as discussed below. pca and unsupervised clustering on the  <dig> individual hybridization datasets indicated that the number of amplification rounds has an obvious effect on measured signal intensities, which cannot be explained by expression differences . no variance was found that was attributable to the duplicate of the tumor sample, implicating that the same sample, treated independently, had only a minor effect on the outcome of gene expression profiles. this consistency in the duplicates indicates that the amplification procedure itself, as well for one round as for two rounds, resulted in reproducible gene expression profiles similar to previous findings  <cit> . despite the relative high pearson correlation coefficients between one and two rounds of amplification, comparable to previous studies  <cit> , concordance correlation revealed very low coefficients, confirming the observations from the bland and altman plots. the results of these statistical tests strongly indicate, as expected, a high agreement within the same amplification method but a very low agreement between the two amplification methods.

the microarray technique is usually used by researchers to identify differentially expressed genes between two different rna samples. therefore, we investigated the effect of the amplification bias on the identification of differentially expressed genes between the tumor and bronchus ldm samples. equal numbers of differentially expressed genes were found after one and two rounds of amplification, confirming the previous findings of wang et al.  <cit> . however, comparison of the list of individual differentially expressed genes demonstrated an inconsistency of up to 30% between one and two rounds of amplification. this percentage remained constant at different significant cut-off levels, indicating that this bias is not due to chance or introduced by noise but is a consistent factor. comparable observations of a decrease in overlap of differentially expressed genes were shown in previous studies where one or two rounds of amplification were compared with unamplified rna  <cit> .

although microarray production companies state that their selected probes are located close to the poly-tail of the corresponding transcripts, analysis of the location of probes on the agilent whg arrays revealed a wide range in probe – poly-tail distances, from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt with a median of  <dig> nt. we showed a significant linear decrease in overall signal intensity of genes with an increase in probe – poly-tail distance . this decrease in signal intensity is most likely due to the more prominent truncation of arna molecules after two rounds of amplification . our results are an extension of the findings of mcclintick et al. who showed a linearly decreased signal after one round of amplification with an increase in probe – poly-tail distances for the probe sets of the affymetrix arrays  <cit> .

genes selected as being differentially expressed based on one round of amplification, had significant shorter probe – poly-tail distances as observed for all genes . in addition, differentially expressed genes after two rounds demonstrated even shorter probe – poly-tail distances . analysis of these 30% inconsistent differentially expressed genes revealed enrichment of genes with long probe – poly-tail distances after one round of amplification, which were lost after two rounds . the differential expression of these inconsistent genes were validated by qrt-pcr, confirming that a second round of amplification resulted in a 30% reduction of truly differentially expressed genes when probes are located > <dig> nt from the poly-tail. thus, it is important to realize that differentially expressed genes can only be identified for those genes that have a short probe – poly-tail distance, especially after two rounds of amplification. genes with probe-poly-tail distances of more than  <dig> nt can be falsely classified as being not differentially expressed. improvement of microarray probe design may help to circumvent the bias introduced by the amplification method, which is currently not optimal for samples with limited amounts of rna.

we microdissected an area of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> μm <dig> tumor or bronchial epithelial tissue in approximately  <dig> hours for each sample. this amount of tissue yielded ~ <dig> ng of total rna. although quite labor intensive, this approach allows the isolation of sufficient rna to apply the more reliable approach including only one round of amplification, since the minimally advised starting amount is  <dig> ng . in general, areas of cell types abundantly present in selected tissue sections, such as squamous cells in non-small cell lung cancer or bronchial epithelial cells in airway tissue, allows isolation of sufficient total rna in a relatively short time to perform only one round of amplification. however, in the case of single cell research it is clearly not realistic to yield sufficient rna for one round of amplification.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that differentially expressed genes, for which the microarray probe is not selected from a region close to the poly-tail, will remain undetected in gene expression profiles obtained after two rounds of amplification. we demonstrated a loss of 30% of truly differentially expressed genes, which may lead to incomplete data with respect to key pathways in the cell type of interest. this study strongly supports the use of a single round of amplification where possible. additionally, our results demonstrate the need of improved amplification procedures and innovative microarray probe design to allow reliable detection of differentially expressed genes for samples with limited amounts of rna.
