BACKGROUND
during growth or activation, a variety of cell types, including hematopoietic, epithelial, and tumor cells, shed small membrane vesicles called microvesicles   <cit> . these microvesicles, which are 30- <dig> nm in diameter, are derived from the endosomal membrane compartment following the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. cells also release microvesicles directly by the outward budding of the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner  <cit> . microvesicles have been also found in various body fluids, such as plasma, malignant pleural effusion, and urine  <cit> . the numerous proteins and bioactive lipids contained in microvesicles differ in composition depending on the types and states of donor cells. recent studies have reported that microvesicles also contain mrna  <cit> . although their biological roles are not completely understood, microvesicles have been shown to stimulate target cells by transferring microvesicular components  into target cells, transferring infectious particles, such as human immunodeficiency virus and prions, and delivering microvesicular mrnas to target cells , where they are translated into functionally active proteins  <cit> . these findings suggest that microvesicles are not cellular debris but are communicasomes, which are extracellular organelles with distinct roles in intercellular communication  <cit> .

colorectal cancer  is one of the most frequent malignant tumors in western countries  <cit> . crc cells also release microvesicles  <cit> , and the revelation from proteomic studies that crc cell-derived microvesicles contain several hundred proteins has helped elucidate the functions of microvesicles at the protein level  <cit> . it has also been reported that rna-lipid complexes are released from the plasma membrane of crc cells, and crc patients show significantly elevated serum mrna levels over those of healthy subjects  <cit> . in view of the higher concentration of rnase in the serum of patients with cancer, these circulating mrnas are likely to be present in a particle-associated form  <cit> . collectively, these observations suggest that crc cell-derived microvesicles carry mrna, together with proteins and lipids, which may exert a functional influence on crc-related processes.

to improve the understanding of the potential roles of crc cell-derived microvesicles in crc-related processes, we conducted a systems approach to the crc cell-derived microvesicles using transcriptome analysis of the microvesicles derived from sw <dig> cells, a human crc cell line, and the donor crc cells. our systems approach to crc cell-derived microvesicles provided  <dig>  microvesicular transcripts that are involved in various tumor-related processes, which suggests that the microvesicles reflect the physiology of the donor crc cells. furthermore, we found that crc-derived microvesicles enriched with cell cycle-related mrnas that showed differential expression patterns in crc patient data. moreover, microvesicles stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells, suggesting that crc-derived microvesicles can be involved in tumor growth and metastasis by facilitating angiogenesis-related processes. our results provide a number of indicators that will not only increase the understanding of pathophysiological functions of tumor derived microvesicles, but also may stimulate the development of novel methods for cancer diagnostics including crc.

RESULTS
purification and characterization of microvesicles derived from human sw <dig> cells
we obtained highly purified microvesicles secreted by human colorectal adenocarcinoma sw <dig> cells using a previously described method with several modifications   <cit> . microvesicles were isolated from the culture supernatant using a combination of differential centrifugation to remove cells and cellular debris, ultrafiltration through a 100-kilodaltons hollow-fiber membrane to concentrate the microvesicles, and ultracentrifugation onto sucrose cushions. the purified microvesicles were treated with rnase a to degrade any non-microvesicular rna and then further purified using iodixanol density-gradient ultracentrifugation to remove non-membranous proteins, protein aggregates, and denatured microvesicles. the microvesicles settled at a density of ~ <dig>  g/ml, as indicated by the microvesicular marker proteins cd <dig> and cd <dig> . an examination of the purified microvesicles using electron microscopy revealed that nearly all were small closed vesicles, approximately 40- <dig> nm in size   <cit> . furthermore, β-actin, hsp <dig>  ezrin, and rab5a, which are known microvesicular proteins, were detected in the purified microvesicles, whereas gm <dig>  a protein present in the cis-golgi apparatus, and cytochrome c, a mitochondrial protein present in apoptotic bodies, were not detected   <cit> .

transcriptomic analysis of microvesicles
for transcriptomic profiling, we extracted high-quality total rna from both purified microvesicles and sw <dig> cells , as indicated by the high rna integrity numbers of bioanalyzer profiles:  <dig>  for cellular rna and  <dig>  for microvesicular rna . the microvesicular β-actin and β-catenin transcripts were further confirmed by rt-pcr analysis . we then prepared crna and hybridized the crna to illumina human- <dig> v <dig> expression beadchips . the technical replicates had a high reproducibility, as shown by the high pearson's correlation  between the normalized intensities of two independent arrays of microvesicular and cellular rnas . moreover, mrna abundances from sw <dig> cells and microvesicles  were also highly correlated , indicating that similar amounts of most cellular mrnas also exist in microvesicles.

from the mrna measurements, we found that most of the mrna transcripts from sw <dig> cells  also existed in sw480-derived microvesicles  . this finding is similar to that of skog et al. , who detected about  <dig>  transcripts in glioblastoma-derived microvesicles  <cit> . in contrast, two previous studies  <cit>  reported that only subsets of genes in endothelial progenitor cells and mouse mast cells  were selectively sorted into microvesicles. a comparison of microvesicular mrnas in our study with those in two previous studies  <cit>   showed that the majority of microvesicular mrnas in those studies were also detected in our study:  <dig>  overlapping transcripts from glioblastoma cells and  <dig> from mouse mast cell mc/ <dig> . using rt-pcr, we confirmed that among the microvesicular transcripts shared by sw <dig> and glioblastoma microvesicles  <cit>  but not detected in mast cell microvesicles, rab <dig>  cxcr <dig>  myc, and fas transcripts were present in the sw480-derived microvesicles .

cellular processes overrepresented by the microvesicular mrnas
we then identified functions overrepresented by the  <dig>  microvesicular mrnas using bingo, a cytoscape plugin  <cit> . figure 4a shows a go tree representing a hierarchical structure of gobps, in which the colored nodes in the go tree indicate significantly overrepresented gobps . the overrepresented cellular processes were categorized into the following groups: cell cycle, cell death, intracellular signaling, intracellular transport, and metabolic processes of protein, rna, and dna . among these groups, figure 4b shows the four groups of gobps closely associated with tumor progression: cell cycle- and mitosis-related processes, apoptosis-related processes, tumor-related intracellular signaling pathways, and vesicle-mediated transport pathways that might be involved in the formation and secretion of microvesicles. collectively, these observations suggest that microvesicular mrnas probably can contribute to promoting tumor progression in target cells when these mrnas are transferred into neighboring target cells.

enrichment of cell cycle-related mrnas in microvesicles
despite the similarities at the global level between the microvesicular and cellular mrnas, we identified  <dig> mrnas whose expression levels were two fold higher in the microvesicles than in sw <dig> cells . we also identified  <dig>  mrnas whose expression levels were two fold higher in sw <dig> cells than in microvesicles . to characterize the processes overrepresented by the microvesicle-enriched genes, we performed go enrichment analysis using bingo, where among the  <dig> microvesicle-enriched genes,  <dig> genes with go annotations were used . unexpectedly, cell cycle-related processes , including m-phase and mitosis , are highly overrepresented by  <dig> out of  <dig> microvesicle-enriched genes . moreover,  <dig> of these  <dig> genes also belong to m-phase cell cycle processes .

to predict the potential roles of the  <dig> cell cycle-related microvesicle-enriched genes at the molecular level, we then reconstructed a biological network  describing the overrepresented cell cycle-related processes . the network was reconstructed using the  <dig> genes belonging to the cell cycle go term and their first and second interaction neighbors obtained from hprd, bind, and biogrid interaction databases. in the network, yellow nodes represent the  <dig> microvesicle-enriched genes,  <dig> of which closely interact with cell cycle-related processes. the network shows that the microvesicle-enriched genes closely interact with key pathways in the cell cycle, including cyclin-dependent kinases  <dig> and n <dig> , centrosomal protein  <dig> kilodaltons , kinensin family members , centromere proteins , anillin , pdz-binding kinase , and nima-related kinase  <dig> . collectively, these observations suggest that the microvesicle-enriched genes may contribute to the increased cell proliferation of target cells during tumor progression by modulating activities of cell cycle-related pathways.

to examine the clinical implications of the  <dig> microvesicle-enriched genes, we collected from the geo database  <cit>  two transcriptomic datasets , including global mrna measurements from crc patients at various stages, and then used cluster analysis to investigate whether these genes are differentially expressed among patients . interestingly, a cluster comprising  <dig> of the  <dig> microvesicle-enriched genes showed consistent differential expression patterns across the patients in the two independent datasets : the expression levels of the genes in each patient sample were compared to their average expression levels in the individual datasets. of these,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes showing differential expression patterns are involved in m-phase-related processes  that are either involved in or interact with components involved in the m-phase of the mitotic cell cycle . note that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes belong to cell cycle gobp. these observations suggest that microvesicle-enriched genes reflect their potential roles in tumor progression in patients with crc.

stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation by microvesicles
based on the observations that microvesicle-enriched mrnas are highly associated with m-phase-related processes , we generated a network-driven hypothesis that crc cell-derived microvesicles promote the proliferation of neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment by increasing their cell cycle activities via the horizontal transfer of microvesicular mrnas, as several recent studies have clearly demonstrated  <cit> . to experimentally verify this hypothesis, we investigated whether crc cell-derived microvesicles can affect the cell cycle of endothelial cells. using rt-pcr, we first confirmed that m-phase-related transcripts including cenpe, kif <dig>  cep <dig>  ccna <dig>  nek <dig>  pbk, and cdk <dig> were present in the sw480-derived microvesicles . when we incubated microvesicles labeled with fluorescent dye with huvecs, we observed a strong red fluorescence in the cytoplasm , indicating that significant amounts of microvesicles were taken up by the huvecs. we then immunostained both phospho-histone h <dig>  and α-tubulin to analyze mitotic spindle formation occurring during the m-phase. a subpopulation of microvesicle-treated huvecs, indicated by a strong phospho-histone h <dig> signal, underwent mitosis . furthermore, at higher magnification, we observed these microvesicle-treated huvecs to be at metaphase , a stage of m-phase, and undergoing cytokinesis with mitotic spindle formation . in contrast, huvecs not treated with microvesicles showed weak histone h <dig> phosphorylation , and none were at metaphase/cytokinesis stages . furthermore, we observed that huvecs treated with microvesicles derived from thp- <dig>  human acute monocytic leukemia cell line showed weak histone h <dig> phosphorylation . these observations clearly support a role for crc cell-derived microvesicles in modulating m-phase activities of the cell cycle and thus promoting proliferation of huvecs, which can initiate angiogenesis.

discussion
this study presents a transcriptomic analysis of crc cell-derived microvesicles, among which we identified  <dig>  microvesicular transcripts involved in various tumor-related processes that reflect the physiology of the donor crc cells. among these transcripts, we found  <dig> mrnas enriched in microvesicles beyond their levels in donor cells, of which  <dig> were involved in the cell cycle. moreover,  <dig> of these  <dig> mrnas were associated with cell cycle m-phase activities, and  <dig> of these showed differential expression patterns in crc patient data. we then demonstrated that these mrnas may modulate activities of m-phase processes during the cell cycle by reconstructing a cell cycle network, which showed that the corresponding proteins belong to and also interact with those involved in m-phase-related processes. to experimentally verify this network-driven hypothesis, we demonstrated that crc cell-derived microvesicles are delivered to endothelial cells and stimulate the proliferation of endothelial cells. since this proliferation is an essential step in neovascularization, our finding suggests that microvesicles have angiogenic activities.

the preparation of microvesicles that are not contaminated with cellular debris, bovine serum-derived microvesicles, or any non-microvesicular mrna is critical for transcriptional profiling of microvesicles. as the half-life of individual microvesicular mrna transcripts is unknown, the rapid analysis of microvesicular mrna is also very important. we therefore followed our previously described purification methods with the following two major modifications  <cit> . in particular, rnase a treatment was applied in order to degrade non-microvesicular rna derived from damaged cells or leaky microvesicles . the microvesicles were finally purified using iodixanol density gradient centrifugation, which is much faster than the conventional sucrose density gradient centrifugation  <cit> . as a result, the high quality of the microvesicular rna was obtained as indicated by the bioanalyzer results .

growing evidence indicates that tumor-derived microvesicles are involved in tumor progression via the modulation of tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, immune response, invasion, and metastasis  <cit> . moreover, recent studies have reported that microvesicular mrna can induce potent epigenetic changes in target cells, as microvesicular mrna is delivered to target cells, where it is translated into functionally active proteins  <cit> . our findings that sw480-derived microvesicular mrnas are involved in various tumor-related processes  and sw480-derived microvesicles can initiate angiogenesis via the stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation  also suggest that the microvesicular mrnas play potential roles in progression of crc. furthermore, sw480-derived microvesicles are enriched with cenpe, kif <dig>  cep <dig>  ccna <dig>  nek <dig>  pbk, and cdk <dig>  that are m-phase-related transcripts involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression  <cit> . although we could not exclude the other possibility, our observations suggest that sw480-derived microvesicles promote the proliferation of endothelial cells by increasing their cell cycle activities via the horizontal transfer of these m-phase-related microvesicular mrnas. further studies on microvesicles derived from other colon cancer cells would provide valuable data. thus, the inhibition of either microvesicle shedding or modulation of microvesicular function has been proposed as worthwhile approaches to cancer therapy. recently, al-nedawi et al.  showed that the treatment of diannexin, which inhibits the uptake of the a <dig> -derived microvesicles into endothelial cells, to a <dig> tumor xenografts in mice led to a reduction of tumor growth rate and microvascular density  <cit> . thus, our findings above suggest that the inhibition of biogenesis, trafficking or function of the crc-derived microvesicles also can offer a novel therapeutic approach for crc.

despite the progress in understanding and treating crc, it remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide  <cit> . a significant improvement in survival would be expected with early diagnosis of crc. several studies have reported that the level of tumor-derived microvesicles is elevated significantly in the serum or the ascites fluid of cancer patients  <cit> . recently, taylor et al. proposed that microrna profiling of circulating tumor microvesicles could potentially be used to identify diagnostic markers for human ovarian cancer  <cit> . thus, our finding that the microvesicular mrna reflects the mrna signature of the parental crc suggests that the microvesicular mrna may be a useful diagnostic and/or prognostic marker of early stage cancer and could be evaluated in a non-invasive manner. possible crc marker candidates can be predicted as the microvesicle-enriched mrnas that show colon-specific expression patterns .

CONCLUSIONS
these study present potential roles of crc cell-derived microvesicles in tumor progression via a global comparative microvesicular and cellular transcriptomic analysis of human sw <dig> crc cells. however, it is not clear how these microvesicular mrnas cooperatively act with other microvesicular components such as lipids and proteins in the target cells. future studies on collective pathophysiological roles of such microvesicular components in modulating dynamically tumor-related networks in the target cells will be valuable in clarifying the microvesicle-involved communication, including that in human crc, and further unraveling the complexity of the intercellular communication involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.
