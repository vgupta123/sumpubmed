BACKGROUND
tuberculosis causes approximately two million deaths annually and it has been estimated that around two billion people are currently infected with the causative organism, mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . attempts to understand the molecular basis of pathogenesis in tuberculosis include the analysis of genes involved in the entry of the bacillus following the initial identification of mammalian cell entry protein, mce1a by arruda et al.  <cit> . subsequent whole genome analysis revealed the presence of four mce operons in m.tuberculosis h37rv, consisting of eight genes with extensive similarity between each other  <cit> . recently, casali et al.  <cit>  redefined the boundaries of mce <dig> making it an operon of  <dig> genes extending from rv <dig> to rv <dig>  the importance of mce operons in virulence is illustrated by various phenotypes observed in knock-out strains and the expression profile of the operons in bacilli in culture and during infection  <cit> .

the conservation of most of the mce operons in all members of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and the presence of orthologous mce genes throughout the genus mycobacteria, including the non-pathogenic species m.smegmatis suggests their functional importance in processes besides pathogenicity  <cit> . casali et al.  <cit>  discovered that fadd <dig> gene  is also a part of the mce <dig> operon, adding to the probable functional diversity of mce operons.

in tune with the proposed functional diversity it has been suggested that mce <dig> operon could be under the control of a global stress regulator or multiple negative regulators  <cit> . rv0165c, a homologue of gntr regulator of mce <dig> operon and rv <dig> a tetr family regulator of mce <dig> operon are characterized as negative regulators of the respective operons  <cit> . the poor consensus of the promoter sequence of mce <dig> operon at - <dig> and - <dig> positions is speculated to reflect the complex regulation of the operon and its ability to interact with multiple sigma factors  <cit> . given the importance of mce <dig> operon and evidences from knock-out studies, any alteration in the expression or genetic polymorphism in mce operons would have significant consequence on the pathogenicity and the severity of infection  <cit> .

here we examine the function of the non-coding sequence between rv <dig> and rv <dig>  which led us to detect both promoter and negative regulatory element within the sequence. a point mutation in the regulatory region abolishes the negative regulation resulting in enhanced promoter activity.

RESULTS
detection of a putative promoter in intergenic region of mce <dig> operon
orf analysis on sequences extending from rv <dig>  across rv <dig>  revealed the expected stop codon for rv <dig> at  <dig> and the initiator codon for rv <dig> at  <dig>  however, no initiator codon was detected in the  <dig> base pairs between rv <dig> and rv <dig>  this region therefore appears to be non-protein coding sequence within the mce <dig> operon in m.tuberculosis h37rv. we examined this sequence for probable promoter signature by in silico analysis. we retrieved  <dig> sequences with demonstrated promoter activity  <cit>  in addition to the intergenic sequence of mce <dig> operon and aligned them with reference to the translational initiation site of the respective gene. the presence of consensus motif was analyzed using meme http://meme.nbcr.net/meme3/meme.html. two motifs ggtt  t and tt     c were identified  and both the motifs are present in the non-coding intergenic region between rv <dig> and rv <dig> of mce <dig> operon . since we detect landmarks of promoters known in m.tuberculosis within this region, we refer to it, henceforth as intergenic promoter . we undertook the functional characterization of the predicted promoter activity of igpr. we analyzed the effect of a point mutation in the igpr, detected in a multi-drug resistant clinical isolate, vpci <dig>  under an independent analysis of genetic polymorphism in mce operons of clinical isolates of m.tuberculosis .

promoter activity of igpr
a  <dig> bp fragment containing igpr sequence was amplified from m.tuberculosis h37rv and cloned in promoter-less shuttle vector psd5b, upstream of the lacz as the reporter gene to generate pprrv. similarly  <dig> bp fragment from vpci <dig> was cloned to produce ppr <dig> and both were tested for promoter activity in m.smegmatis. different constructs used in the study are shown in figure  <dig>  since a repression of mce <dig> operon at stationary phase was reported earlier  <cit> , we analyzed the promoter activity of the two constructs both at log and stationary phase of growth, by onpg assay using cell-free extracts from transformed m.smegmatis cells . the difference in the promoter activity of igpr from vpci <dig>  is higher than that from m.tuberculosis h37rv  by  <dig> fold  in log phase, which reaches  <dig> fold  in stationary phase . by comparing igpr with previously characterized weak  and strong  promoters from m.tuberculosis  <cit> , we find that pprrv is a weak promoter while ppr <dig> acts as a strong promoter.

deletion analysis of igpr region
in order to delineate the region of promoter activity within the  <dig> base pairs of igpr, we made a series of deletion constructs. we generated amplicons corresponding to , ,  and  and cloned them in psd5b for expression in m.smegmatis . the promoter activity of  <dig> base pairs from m.tuberculosis h37rv  is very low compared to that of the same region from vpci <dig> ;  <dig> vs  <dig> units respectively. the promoter activity is highest when - <dig> to + <dig> is deleted  both in log  and stationary phase of growth ; while it is negligible, when - <dig> to- <dig> is deleted . additionally, the fragment containing only - <dig> to - <dig>  shows poor activity. therefore we conclude that the promoter activity is restricted to around  <dig> base pairs from - <dig> to - <dig> within igpr . interestingly, significant promoter activity is detected in the construct that is deleted for - <dig> to + <dig> . these results suggest that - <dig> to + <dig> region cloned in pprrv has a negative effect which is lost in ppr <dig> derived from the clinical isolate vpci <dig>  we correlate this gain of expression due to loss of repression to the presence of a point mutation  at - <dig> in vpci <dig> 

to compare the mrna levels from the two constructs, we isolated total rna from m.smegmatis transformed with pprrv  and ppr <dig>  and the transcript level was estimated by quantitative pcr with lacz as target gene and siga as the endogenous control in log and stationary phase. at log phase there is nearly two fold increase in lacz transcripts in ppr <dig> as compared to pprrv whereas in stationary phase it is more than four fold . the correlation between β-galactosidase activity and the mrna levels of lacz clearly indicate greater transcriptional activity in ppr <dig> than pprrv. the difference in enzyme activity is much higher than the difference in mrna levels as known in other cases  <cit> .

mapping the transcription start site in m.tuberculosis
we identified transcription start site of rv <dig> and rv <dig> in vivo in m.tuberculosis h37rv and vpci <dig> using fluorescence tagged primers in primer extension assay using rna templates. the absence of dna contamination in rna preparation was confirmed by pcr for rv <dig> and rv <dig> in absence of reverse transcriptase . the sizing of the products was carried out by genescan analysis and the tss was detected at - <dig> position from the translation initiation site of rv <dig> and at - <dig> position from the translation initiation site of rv <dig> , suggesting that there are two potential promoters for mce <dig> operon generating two transcripts, one including rv <dig> and the other without it . further, this demonstrated that both promoters are active in the genomic context of m.tuberculosis. considering the translation initiation site of rv <dig> as + <dig>  we map the transcription start site within igpr at - <dig> position and the mutation in vpci <dig> at - <dig> position.

estimation of mce <dig> operon transcript levels in m.tuberculosis
the transcript level of rv <dig>  rv <dig> and rv <dig> of mce <dig> operon downstream to igpr in m.tuberculosis and vpci <dig> was analyzed by quantitative pcr with rpob as the endogenous control . the data reveals  <dig>  fold upregulation of the mce <dig> operon genes in vpci <dig> as compared to m.tuberculosis h37rv . the difference at protein level is considerably higher than at the transcript levels in case of β-galactosidase, similar enhancement in mce <dig> protein levels could also be anticipated.

effect of the regulatory sequence of igpr on heterologous promoter
to examine if the negative regulatory site, - <dig> to + <dig> region of igpr functions independent of the associated promoter activity, we cloned it downstream of a heterologous promoter in psdps <dig>  driving the expression of β-galactosidase  <cit> . psdps <dig> has  <dig> kb upstream region of the gene msmeg_ <dig> from m.smegmatis. the promoter in psdps <dig> is inducible under glucose starvation; at  <dig> % glucose in middlebrook 7h <dig> liquid medium in stationary phase  <cit> . by inclusion of + <dig> to - <dig> from igpr of h37rv  the promoter activity decreased by 35% relative to the control plasmid psdps <dig> . when + <dig> to - <dig> from vpci <dig> was cloned downstream to dps promoter , the repression was reversed and the promoter activity was enhanced by 25% over that of psdps <dig> . this shows that negative regulation by igpr functions in the context of a heterologous promoter also.

discussion
the mce <dig> operon is different from other three mce operons in having rv <dig>  a fatty acyl coa synthetase that catalyzes the initial step in lipid degradation  <cit> . on the other hand, mce <dig> operon is known to be a part of the regulon involved in cholesterol metabolism, however it seems to be just one of the many possible lipid substrates. furthermore, it is speculated that mce <dig> operon may not have a role in cholesterol import as the loss of mce <dig> transporter system does not appear to affect the residual uptake of cholesterol in mce4- deficient strain  <cit> .

the presence of  <dig> base pairs of non-coding sequence between rv <dig> and rv <dig> is yet another feature peculiar to mce <dig> operon among the other four operons present in m.tuberculosis. in most other operons and also the other genes within mce <dig> operon, the intergenic distance is not more than one or two codons and often the translation initiation site of one gene is within the coding sequence of the adjacent gene  <cit> . in silico analysis using generunner software shows the absence of any orfs in the intergenic region between rv <dig> and rv <dig>  while ribosomal binding site corresponding to the translational start site of rv <dig> is reported in tuberculist database. although most prokaryotes do not have introns, the intergenic region in transcripts serve as substrates for several endonucleases such as rnasep involved in mrna processing and hence are implicated in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> .

we have characterized the promoter and negative regulatory activity in the surrogate host m.smegmatis, but the detection of two active transcription initiation sites both in m.tuberculosis h37rv and vpci <dig> suggests both promoters are functional in their native context also.

however the increased promoter strength of the regulatory region from vpci <dig> in m.smegmatis is not reflected in the difference in the transcript levels for mce <dig> operon genes in vpci <dig> as compared to m.tuberculosis h37rv. this may have two reasons, one that both p <dig> and p <dig> promoters are active in vivo and therefore contribute to the transcript levels in both the strains, while in m.smegmatis we observe a clear upregulation of p <dig> when the negative regulation is lost due to point mutation and p <dig> is absent . further, the difference in fold increase in β-galactosidase activity vis-ΰ-vis its transcript levels are significantly different. similar discordance between protein and mrna levels is reported in mycobacteria and s.cerevisiae  <cit> . moreover, in vivo mce <dig> operon could be under the regulatory influence of several factors acting directly or indirectly  <cit> .

we looked for concordance in the expression level of rv <dig> and  <dig>  as polycistronic mrna including rv <dig> in m.tuberculosis is reported by casali et al.  <cit> . for comparison, we examined the expression of pairs of adjacent genes in five different operons including rv <dig> and rv <dig> of mce  <dig> operon, rv2498c and rv2499c of cite-scoa operon along with that of rv <dig> and rv <dig> of mce <dig> operon. the expression data was taken from published microarray profiles of m.tuberculosis h37rv cells grown in culture  <cit> . pearson's correlation coefficient in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  is observed in all cases except rv <dig> and rv <dig> of mce <dig> operon . similar difference between coefficient of correlation was observed when we considered the data from clinical isolates grown in middlebrook 7h <dig> medium  <cit> . these results imply that the transcript level is lower for rv <dig> compared to rv <dig>  as rv <dig> can be transcribed only from p <dig> while rv <dig> can be transcribed from both p <dig> and p <dig> promoters. thus lending support to our data suggesting that both promoters of mce <dig> operon are active in cells in culture.

though m. tuberculosis system is replete with examples where the expression of an operon is driven by multiple promoters  <cit> , the promoters are known to drive the expression of all the genes of the operon. a study on fura-katg region shows differential regulation of two katg promoters resulting in two different transcripts depending on the stage of infection of mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . however the consequences of transcription from intergenic promoter could be different. it can only be speculated that two different polycistronic mrna varying in coding capacity for a catalytic function can be produced by mce <dig> operon: one that includes fatty acyl-coa synthase  and other lacking it, in absence of in vivo infection data. this suggests the possible modulation of the function of mce <dig> operon in cell entry and lipid metabolism vis-ΰ-vis its catalytic function. however, it remains to be examined if the intergenic promoter/regulatory region in mce <dig> operon could bring about differential regulation during infection.

the mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons are known to be negatively regulated by divergently transcribed genes mapping immediately upstream of the operon  <cit> . though mce1r, the product of rv0165c is characterized as a negative regulator of mce <dig> operon, its binding site is not deciphered so far. the results of casali et al.  <cit>  suggest that the site of interaction of mce1r is in a region upstream of rv <dig>  while the negative regulatory element we have identified is downstream to rv <dig>  further we failed to detect direct binding of intergenic promoter with purified his-tagged rv0165c cloned in pet-28a in gel-shift assays even at high molar ratio of protein to dna . therefore, it appears that mce <dig> operon has more than one negative regulator. however, it is interesting to note that a heterologous promoter in psdps <dig> is also down regulated by the regulatory region of - <dig> to + <dig> fragment of igpr, thus demonstrating that the  <dig> bp fragment is necessary and sufficient for repressive activity.

casali et al.  <cit>  also observed that mce <dig> operon can be repressed independent of mce1r by incubation in dmem medium and suggest that mce <dig> operon may be under multiple negative regulators. based on their study on lipid degradation operon kendall et al.  <cit>  observed that operon regulation may be more complex than one would expect for a prokaryotic system and may not be guided by just a single regulator.

CONCLUSIONS
our data strongly supports the presence of two functional promoters for mce <dig> operon in m.tuberculosis that could potentially segregate different functions of a single operon. our results demarcating the regulatory sequences in the intergenic region of mce <dig> operon provide a handle for identifying interacting factors and studying the implications of derepression in the clinical isolate.
