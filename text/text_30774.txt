BACKGROUND
prepulse inhibition  is a phenomenon whereby a weak leading stimulus, or prepulse, inhibits startling reflexes evoked by a subsequent intense abrupt stimulus
 <cit> . ppi is commonly considered a preattentional inhibitory process called sensorimotor gating, by which sensory information is screened so that an individual can focus on the most salient aspects of the sensory environment
 <cit> . ppi is useful for investigating mechanisms of sensory filtering because it is common to all mammals, which enables findings to be compared between humans and animals
 <cit> . clinically, ppi has been repeatedly shown to be impaired in patients with schizophrenia
 <cit>  and unaffected first-degree relatives of probands
 <cit> . therefore, ppi is an important tool to investigate the biology of schizophrenia. usually, an intense sound is used to elicit auditory startle responses. the blink reflex is measured in humans by using electromyography and whole-body flinching is measured in rodents by using stabilimeter chambers.

change-related cortical responses are a sensory-evoked cortical activation specific to a change of stimulus, and recorded very clearly with electroencephalography  or magnetoencephalography . the change-related response is elicited without any tasks and without the subject’s attention by any sensory changes including the onset and offset of a stimulus in the auditory
 <cit> , somatosensory
 <cit>  and visual
 <cit>  systems. in addition to sensory-specific areas, multi-modal cortical regions that specifically respond to sensory changes are shown in functional magnetic resonance imaging  and meg studies
 <cit> . since the automatic change-detecting system is thought to play an important role in the quick detection of changes in the sensory environment and therefore in survival, it can be considered a subtype of defense reactions like the startle reflex is
 <cit> . as change-related responses are based on the comparison of a new sensory event with the preceding status, sensory memory and a comparison process are involved in generating them. in fact, the latency and magnitude of change-related responses depends on the duration
 <cit>  and intensity
 <cit>  of the preceding stimulus, in addition to the magnitude of the change itself
 <cit> .

based on the similarity between the startle reflex and change-related cortical response with respect to both physiological significance and experimental behavior, we hypothesized that the change-related cortical response is inhibited by a preceding weak stimulus in a similar manner to ppi. given the defensive and attentional role of the change-related response, the processing of a leading weak change should be protected from being drowned out by a subsequent greater change. to test this, we recorded auditory change-related cortical responses using meg, and examined effects of a preceding weak change  in the present study.

methods
the study was approved in advance by the ethics committee of the national institute for physiological sciences, okazaki, japan, and written consent was obtained from all the subjects. the experiment was performed on twelve  healthy volunteers, aged 25– <dig>  years. they were asked to refrain from alcohol, caffeine and smoking for at least  <dig> hours prior to the experiment. there were two smokers. all subjects were without a history of mental or neurological disorders, or substance abuse in the last two years. they were free of medication at testing. all subjects underwent a psychiatric assessment using the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview
 <cit> , and had a hearing threshold lower than  <dig> db at  <dig> hz as assessed by an audiometer .

auditory stimuli
for auditory stimuli, we used a train of brief tone pulses
 <cit> . the brief tone was  <dig> hz in frequency,  <dig> ms in length , and  <dig> db spl in sound pressure. by using a train of brief standard tones followed by physically different tones, we could easily create an abruptly changing tone stimulus. when any changes occur in a continuous sound, a clear cortical response peaking at around  <dig> ms is recorded using eeg  or meg 
 <cit> . in the present study, we used an abrupt increase of sound pressure by  <dig> db to evoke change-n1m, and effects of a preceding weak and brief change of sound pressure on change-n1m were assessed by using a conditioning-test paired stimulation paradigm. in this study, we used four types of sound stimuli :  <dig> repeats of the same 65-db brief tone  <dig> ms in total duration ,  <dig> standard brief tones  followed by  <dig> tones of  <dig> db , the test preceded by one brief tone  that was stronger than the standard tone but the same as or weaker than the test , and the standard with a prepulse . sound stimuli were presented binaurally through ear pieces .

meg recordings
magnetic signals were recorded using a 306-channel whole-head type meg system , which comprised  <dig> identical triple sensor elements. each sensor element consisted of two orthogonal planar gradiometers and one magnetometer coupled to a multi-superconducting quantum interference device  and thus provided  <dig> independent measurements of the magnetic fields. in this study, we analyzed meg signals recorded from  <dig> planar-type gradiometers. these planar gradiometers are powerful enough to detect the largest signal just over local cerebral sources. the signals were recorded with a bandpass filter of  <dig> - <dig> hz and digitized at  <dig> hz. the analysis was conducted from  <dig> ms before to  <dig> ms after the onset of each stimulus. epochs with meg signals larger than  <dig>  pt / cm were rejected from the averaging.

procedures
the experiments were conducted in a quiet, magnetically shielded room. the subjects sat in a chair and watched a silent movie on a screen  <dig>  m in front of them throughout the experiments. experiments  <dig> and  <dig> were carried out in this order on all subjects and separated by a  <dig> ~ 10-day interval. two experiments were carried out at almost the same time of the day in each subject. an additional experiment was carried out on three subjects.

experiment 1
to assess effects of the intensity of the prepulse, prepulses of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> db spl  were used as the conditioning  stimulus. therefore, there were ten stimuli: 1) standard alone, 2) test alone, 3) ~ 6) prepulse alone, and 7) ~ 10) prepulse + test. in the 3) ~ 10) stimuli, the tenth pulse  was the prepulse. since the test started at  <dig> ms, the interstimulus interval  between the offset of the prepulse and the onset of the test was  <dig> ms. in this study, the prepulse-test interval was expressed as the isi. ten stimuli were presented randomly at an even probability at a trial-trial interval of  <dig> ms. for each stimulus,  <dig> ~  <dig> artifact-free epochs were averaged.

experiment 2
to assess effects of the interval between the prepulse and the test, isis of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ms were used. the test was the same as in experiment  <dig>  the prepulse was a 25-ms tone  <dig> db in sound pressure . similar to experiment  <dig>  there were ten stimuli that were presented randomly at an even probability at a trial-trial interval of  <dig> ms. for each stimulus,  <dig> ~  <dig> artifact-free epochs were averaged.

experiment 3
to examine whether a subtle change other than the sound pressure increase affects the test-evoked cortical responses, two 25-ms prepulses of a decrease of sound pressure  and a frequency change  were used as the conditioning stimulus. there were six stimuli that were presented randomly: 1) standard alone; 2) test alone; 3) and 4) prepulse alone ; and 5) and 6) prepulse + test. the isi between the prepulse and the test stimulus was  <dig> ms. the trial-trial interval was  <dig> ms. for each stimulus,  <dig> ~  <dig> artifact-free epochs were averaged.

analyses
in figure
 <dig>  procedures to analyze the evoked response are shown using data for a representative subject. recorded meg waveforms were subjected to band-pass filtering of  <dig> ~  <dig> hz
 <cit> . to obtain prepulse-evoked magnetic responses, a difference waveform was calculated by subtracting the waveform for the standard from that for the prepulse alone. the test-evoked magnetic response was obtained by subtracting the waveform for the prepulse alone from that for the prepulse + test stimulus . the difference waveforms were used for analyses. an equivalent current dipole for the main component of the change-related responses, change-n1m, was estimated for each hemisphere by use of besa  as described elsewhere
 <cit> . since the main purpose of the present study was to clarify whether the prepulse inhibits the test response, the dipole analysis was performed only for the test-evoked magnetic response for the test alone stimulus , and the model obtained was applied to all the difference waveforms in the same experiment. then the peak amplitude and latency were measured using the source strength waveform . in the following text, the cortical response indicates the time course of the strength of a dipole . the test-evoked response indicates source strength waveform for the difference magnetic waveform obtained by subtracting the magnetic waveform for the prepulse alone stimulus from that for the prepulse + test stimulus. the prepulse-evoked response indicates the source strength waveform for the difference magnetic waveform obtained by subtracting the magnetic waveform for the standard stimulus from that for the prepulse alone stimulus . the test-evoked response for the test alone stimulus was obtained by subtracting the waveform for the standard from that for the test alone stimulus. in the present study, the peak amplitude of change-n1m was the amplitude between the peak of change-n1m around  <dig> ms and the peak of a polarity-reversed earlier component around  <dig> ms
 <cit> . this procedure minimizes problems due to a baseline shift. as compared to the response to the test, the cortical response to the prepulse is weak. we defined the prepulse-evoked response as significant when the peak amplitude was larger than  <dig> sd of the prestimulus baseline. the percentage inhibition of the amplitude of the test response by the prepulse  was defined as  / test-evoked response to the test alone stimulus *  <dig> 

the location of estimated dipoles was expressed in talairach coordinates by using besa and brain voyager . for both experiment  <dig> and  <dig>  statistical differences were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance . when the sphericity assumption was violated, the greenhouse-geisser correction coefficient epsilon was used for correcting the degrees of freedom and then the f-value and significance probability were re-calculated. to compare the difference between conditions, post-hoc multiple comparisons were done with bonferroni-adjusted t-tests. all statistical analyses were performed at the  <dig>  level of significance. data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation .

RESULTS
in all the  <dig> subjects, the test, an abrupt increase of sound pressure by  <dig> db, evoked a clear change-n1m. the dipole for the change-n1m was estimated to be located in the supratemporal plane around the superior temporal gyrus  as described previously
 <cit> . the mean x, y, and z talairach coordinates of the dipole were − <dig>  - <dig>  and  <dig> for the left hemisphere, and  <dig>  - <dig>  and  <dig> for the right hemisphere in experiment  <dig>  respective values of experiment  <dig> were − <dig>  - <dig>  and  <dig> for the left hemisphere, and  <dig>  - <dig>  and  <dig> for the right.

experiment 1
the mean peak amplitude and latency of test-evoked change-n1m of the five conditions are listed in table
 <dig>  for instructive purposes, grand-averaged waveforms across subjects are shown in figure
3a. in both hemispheres, the change-n1m amplitude decreased with the increase in the intensity of the prepulse  in a linear fashion. the difference among conditions was significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig>  for the left hemisphere; f  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig>  for the right hemisphere). post-hoc tests indicated that the change-n1m amplitude of the 3-db  and 5-db  prepulse condition was significantly smaller than that of the test-alone condition in the left hemisphere. also in the right hemisphere, the amplitude of the 3-db  and 5-db  conditions was significantly smaller than the test. the mean %ppi  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> db prepulses, respectively in the left hemisphere, and the difference among conditions was significant  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). in the right hemisphere, the respective value was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). the mean peak latency of change n1m increased with the increase in the prepulse intensity , but the difference was not significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for the left hemisphere; f  =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for the right hemisphere).

values are the mean ± sd.

a significant response  to the prepulse itself  was elicited by the  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 5-db prepulse in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> subjects, respectively in the left hemisphere, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> subjects in the right hemisphere. the amplitude of the prepulse-evoked response in both the 3-db and 5-db prepulse conditions correlated linearly with the amplitude of the test-evoked response for the test-alone stimulus .

experiment 2
the mean amplitude and latency of the test-evoked change-n1m in all conditions are listed in table
 <dig>  the grand-averaged waveform is shown in figure
 <dig>  in both hemispheres, the change-n1m amplitude decreased with the decrease in the isi  =  <dig> , p = <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig>  for the left hemisphere; f  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig>  for the right hemisphere). as compared to the test alone condition, the change-n1m amplitude was significantly smaller for the 100-ms isi  and 50-ms isi  conditions in the right hemisphere. the mean %ppi  was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 50-ms isi, respectively in the left hemisphere  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). in the right hemisphere, the respective %ppi was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig> ). the peak latency of test-evoked change-n1m was longer for the shorter isi prepulse condition . the difference among conditions was significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig>  for the left hemisphere; f  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , partial η <dig> =  <dig>  for the right hemisphere). the prepulse elicited a significant prepulse-evoked response in only  <dig> ~  <dig> subjects in each isi condition .

experiment 3
test- and prepulse-evoked responses of the three subjects tested are shown in figure
 <dig>  in all three subjects, the 3db-down prepulse attenuated the change-n1m amplitude . the prepulse of a subtle frequency change attenuated change-n1m clearly in the right hemisphere in all subjects , but for the left hemisphere, the inhibitory effect was weaker . like in experiment  <dig> and  <dig>  the peak latency tended to be longer when the prepulse was present. the prepulse-evoked response was absent or very weak.

test-retest reliability, and correlation between the degree of ppi and change-n1m amplitude
the amplitude of the test-evoked change-n1m for the test alone stimulus was compared between experiment  <dig> and  <dig>  data plots in figure
6a show the change-n1m amplitude of experiment  <dig>  against that for experiment  <dig>  in both hemispheres of all the subjects. both the slope of the regression line  and the coefficient  show that change-n1m is stable and therefore suitable for comparison among conditions confirming a recent study
 <cit> . scatter plots in figure
6b show correlation between the amplitude of change-n1m for the test alone stimulus and %ppi by the 5-db prepulse in experiment  <dig>  there was a linear correlation . results of similar analyses showed a significant correlation for the 3-db prepulse  but not for the  <dig> -db  and  <dig> -db  prepulse. similarly, there was a clear positive correlation between the amplitude of the test-evoked response to the test alone stimulus and %ppi for the prepulse of 50ms-isi in experiment  <dig>  but not other isis .

similar analyses were conducted for the relationship between the amplitude of the prepulse-evoked response and %ppi in experiment  <dig>  among the  <dig> hemispheres with a significant prepulse-evoked response in the 3-db condition, the %ppi correlated significantly with the amplitude of the prepulse-evoked response . however, when %ppi was compared between the  <dig> hemispheres with a significant prepulse-evoked response and  <dig> hemispheres without a significant response, %ppi was not different . among  <dig> hemispheres with a significant prepulse-evoked response in the 5-db prepulse condition, %ppi correlated significantly with the amplitude of the prepulse-evoked response .

discussion
the present study demonstrated that auditory change-related cortical responses to an abrupt increase of sound pressure are attenuated by a preceding weaker and briefer change stimulus  in a similar manner to the ppi of startle responses. that is, the degree of inhibition depends on the intensity of the prepulse and the time between the prepulse and test stimulus. the inhibition occurs even when the prepulse itself does not evoke a significant response, and the degree of inhibition appears to reflect the subject’s inherent sensitivity to a sensory change. although further studies are necessary to determine whether the present phenomenon and ppi of the startle reflex have common physiological significance or mechanisms, prepulse inhibition of the cerebral response would advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying sensory gating or its deficits in certain disease such as schizophrenia.

the findings in experiment  <dig> that %ppi increases with an increase in the prepulse intensity is consistent with ppi of startle reflexes, in which stronger or more salient prepulses induce greater inhibition in general
 <cit> . similar to ppi of startle reflexes in humans
 <cit>  and mice
 <cit> , %ppi was positively correlated with the amplitude of the prepulse-evoked response . we consider that the prepulse and test stimulus activate a similar, or even identical, group of neurons reflected by change-n1m, that greater prepulse-evoked responses inhibit the test response more strongly, and, therefore, that subjects who are more sensitive to an abrupt sensory change are more strongly inhibited by the prepulse, which is in line with the protective hypothesis of ppi
 <cit> . however, results of experiment  <dig> in which %ppi was not influenced by the presence of the significant prepulse-evoked response suggest that ppi can happen when the prepulse-alone response is under the detection threshold as in ppi of the startle reflex
 <cit> , and that absence of the prepulse-alone response in such a case does not mean an absence of brain responses to shape change-n1m or to inhibit the test response.

results of experiment  <dig> showed that %ppi depends on the interval between the prepulse and test similar to ppi of the startle response in which an isi of  <dig> ~  <dig> ms is used for eliciting ppi
 <cit> . in the present study , a shorter isi produced greater ppi. however, as shown in figure
6c, %ppi of the 50-ms isi distributed widely from − <dig> to 77%. in  <dig> of  <dig> hemispheres, %ppi was smaller for the 50-ms than 100-ms isi, which might be due to prepulse facilitation at a short isi
 <cit> . it seems possible in non-sensitive subjects that a prepulse at a short isi serves as a part of the test stimulus and enhances the response. from the viewpoint that ppi can be used as a powerful endophenotype in studies of schizophrenia
 <cit> , such a broad distribution may be of benefit.

results of experiment  <dig> demonstrated that the test response evoke by an abrupt increase of sound pressure can be inhibited by a prepulse with a change in different auditory features. we consider that this also supports the protective hypothesis since any detectable changes activate the change-detecting system, and once the system is activated, its activity should be protected for a certain period to complete the processing from being interfered with by succeeding events. the results may be useful to design the best protocol to use ppi of cortical responses, that is, change-n1m can be elicited by any auditory change including frequency, intensity, and sound location
 <cit> , and a brief preceding sound with any feature change from the background can be a prepulse.

like in our previous studies , the change-related response tended to be larger in amplitude in the right hemisphere  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) for experiment  <dig>  t =  <dig> , p =  <dig>  for experiment 2) implying right hemisphere dominance for change detection. however, neither the main effect of the hemisphere nor the interaction with the experimental conditions was significant  for ppi. since the present study used a fixed sound pressure level for both ears, a small difference in the hearing threshold between the ears might result in differences observed for the hemispheres. for evaluation of the hemispheric differences for the change-related response and its ppi, careful adjustment of the sound pressure level and detailed information of the handedness appear to be necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we demonstrated that auditory change-related cortical responses are inhibited by a prepulse in a similar manner to ppi of startle reflexes. since auditory change-n1m is 1) easily recorded using eeg within a few minutes
 <cit> , 2) evoked by a small deviance of a sound feature without using an intense stimulus, and 3) stable like the blink reflex and its ppi are
 <cit> , it would be a valuable tool for understanding mechanisms of sensory gating or its deficits in a disease such as schizophrenia. in future studies, ppi should be compared directly between the startle reflexes and cortical responses to find similarities and dissimilarities. comparisons with other experimental measures of inhibitory control, such as p <dig> gating
 <cit>  or ppi of perceived intensity
 <cit> , are also necessary. another potential future study is a genetic
 <cit>  or pharmacological study. for example, nicotine is known to augment ppi of the startle reflex
 <cit>  as well as the generation of change-n1m
 <cit> .
