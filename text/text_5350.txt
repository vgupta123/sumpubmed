BACKGROUND
cellular life on earth has evolved circadian timekeeping to enable the anticipation of predictable daily changes in exposure to light and temperature, originating from our planet's approximately 24-hour rotation around its axis. many high-order organismal processes are rhythmic, such as sleep, wakefulness, and alertness in animals, leaf movement in plants, and reproduction in fungi and certain algae. the basis for these rhythms is a strong cellular circadian organisation that includes rhythmic transcription of such a large set of genes that no cellular process appears to be unaffected by circadian rhythmicity. at the core of this daily transcriptional reprogramming lies a set of clock genes that regulate their own expression directly or indirectly, by a complex circuitry of transcriptional feedback loops  <cit> . the organisational logic of these transcriptional/translational feedback mechanisms  is broadly shared among diverse species, and for many years were thought to constitute the sole basis of circadian timekeeping in eukaryotes, although the identity of oscillating genes bare no similarity across kingdoms. therefore, it was surprising that the intricate molecular motions of cellular ttfl systems across diverse species were found to be tuned by conserved regulator proteins such as assorted chaperones and enzymes that mediate post-translational modification  <cit> . this functional conservation stretches far along the branches of the tree of life, as the same set of regulator proteins are known to affect timekeeping in humans, rodents, drosophila, and neurospora and more recently were shown to affect timekeeping in the unicellular marine alga ostreococcus tauri <cit> . these results might reflect divergent evolution of cellular timekeeping from a common basis whereby ttfl mechanisms have been recruited in an organism- and tissue-dependent manner, appropriate to cellular function  <cit> . this idea is supported by the identification of rhythms in the oxidation state of peroxiredoxin  proteins in o. tauri <cit> , which are conserved in mammalian cells  <cit> , as well as in other eukaryotes and certain prokaryotes  <cit> . remarkably, under certain conditions , the redox oscillations reported by prx oxidation are observed to persist independently of ttfl rhythmicity, but appear to be tightly coupled with them under normal conditions  <cit> .

among the broadly conserved modifier proteins with clock function across taxa is casein kinase  <dig>  <cit> . several isoforms of ck <dig> are known to affect clocks in animal  <cit>  and fungal model species  <cit> . recently, the first identification of ck <dig> activity being also relevant to timekeeping in the green lineage was reported  <cit> . functional conservation of ck <dig> in the ostreococcus tauri clock goes some way to demonstrate that ubiquitous post-translational modifier proteins are indeed mechanistic components of the cellular clock. the target proteins for ck <dig> in the ttfls across different kingdoms  <cit>  are not broadly conserved. the first clock-relevant ck <dig> target was identified in animals; the period  proteins. rhythmic phosphorylation of per by ck <dig> regulates per stability as well as nucleocytoplasmic shuttling  <cit> . in neurospora, ck <dig> rhythmically phosphorylates frequency , resulting in its degradation  <cit> . for both animal per and fungal frq, their cognate ttfl activator protein is also directly ck1-responsive; the clock/bmal complex in animals  <cit> , and the white collar complex in neurospora  <cit> . a big question thus remains how proteins like ck <dig> affect timekeeping across species if the ttfl target proteins that were identified in either species are not conserved between them.

the naturally occurring hamster ck1ϵ mutation tau <cit>  exhibits a period-shortening phenotype that was recently translated to mouse  <cit> . this period phenotype is a consequence of a gain-of-function mutation in the active site of ck1ϵ  resulting in increased phosphorylation of per protein  <cit> , leading to its more rapid degradation. interestingly, the increased activity of ck1tau is specific for per and not observed for other targets. for that reason we incorporated the equivalent mutation  into an o. tauri ck <dig> overexpression construct to test whether this allele would impact on circadian phenotype indiscriminately from the wild-type ck <dig> allele previously published  <cit> , or whether there would be a substrate similarly recognised as per. this phenotype includes long-period rhythmicity, reduced sensitivity to ck <dig> inhibitor ic <dig>  and a trend towards increased protein phosphorylation in the broad phospho-proteome as well as in predicted ck <dig> target sites. comparison between these wild-type and ck1tau allele overexpression lines revealed a close correlation on all phenotypes tested. these results validate ck <dig> target proteins in this minimal circadian system. many of these target proteins are broadly conserved and should offer a rich resource to inform further studies on ck <dig> activity in any organism with a circadian clock.

RESULTS
affected residue in tau mutant hamsters is invariant across species
to identify whether the single amino acid altered in the hamster tau allele is present in o. tauri ck <dig>  protein sequences of clock-relevant ck <dig> isoforms from diverse model organisms were aligned . the region around the tau mutation  <cit>  is highly conserved, as indicated by the consensus logo generated from the alignment  implying a vital cellular function for this domain. we found that the arginine itself is invariant across all ck <dig> sequences tested, and in o. tauri corresponds to r <dig> 

overexpression of ck1tau induces long-period rhythms
to test the effect of mutating this arginine would be, we made the analogous tau mutation r200c in an overexpression construct of ck <dig> previously used to prove conserved clock function for ck <dig> in o. tauri <cit> . similar to the previous study, transgenic lines were generated that overexpressed ck1tau in cells carrying a rhythmically luminescent reporter . after verification of transgene expression,  <dig> independent ck1tau overexpression lines were selected and compared to the parent line. in all cases, a statistically significant long-period phenotype was observed , associated with an approximately 2-fold overexpression level . the period lengthening that was observed upon overexpression of ck1tau was in the same range as that resulting from overexpression of the wild-type ck <dig> allele  averaged for  <dig> independent overexpression lines previously published  <cit> . this result shows that the effects of both alleles on period lengthening are very similar.

ck1tau overexpression decreases the effects of ck <dig> inhibitor ic261
inhibition of ck <dig> with the specific inhibitor ic <dig> was previously shown to lengthen period in o. tauri by approximately two hours  <cit> . overexpression of ck <dig> negated this period-lengthening effect, indicating firstly that ic <dig> indeed targets ck <dig> in o. tauri, and secondly that ck <dig> overexpression increases cellular ck <dig> activity. to verify that this increase in kinase activity also holds true for the ck1tau overexpression lines, the effect of ic <dig> on the ck1tau-ox <dig> line was analysed . an initial phase advance is observed upon ic <dig> treatment, followed by a dose-dependent long period rhythm in the parent line . the period-lengthening effect of ic <dig> is indeed decreased in ck1tau-ox <dig> compared to the ck1-ox line , similarly to the result obtained with overexpression of the wild-type allele .

phospho-proteomic analysis of ck1tau overexpression line
to verify whether overexpression of the tau mutant indeed has an indiscriminable effect on the o. tauri clock from wild-type ck <dig> overexpression, the phospho-proteome of the parent line was compared to that of the ck1tau overexpressor. protein extracts from both were trypsinised and subjected to phospho-enrichment followed by label-free mass spectrometric quantification of each individual phospho-site detected. out of a total of  <dig> detected unique phospho-sites,  <dig> were significantly differential  between the parent line and the ck1tau-ox <dig> line ; i.e. showed a fold-change of over  <dig>  with p <  <dig>  . the majority of these differential phosphorylation events were upregulated , verifying that ck1tau represents an active kinase protein, as well as providing additional candidates for conserved ck1-mediated clock regulation.

strong correlation between ck1- and ck1tau-responsive phospho-sites
combination of the results presented here with the publicly available results of label-free phospho-proteomic analysis of the wild-type ck <dig> allele  <cit>  could provide evidence whether the ck1-responsive events observed are reproducible, true targets. when the significantly differential results from additional file  <dig> were plotted against those published for wild-type ck <dig>  we observed that although the total number of phospho-sites observed for ck1tau-ox <dig> was slightly lower, a majority of the upregulated sites  and a third of the down-regulated sites  were shared between both sets of results . this striking similarity between overexpression of two distinct constructs indicates that the tau mutation indeed is not functionally different from the wild-type allele in the o. tauri genetic background, and that the coverage of the phospho-proteome in this minimal circadian model organism is exceptionally high using the methods described here and previously  <cit> . ultimately, the observed overlap increases confidence that the identified ck <dig> responsive sites are physiologically relevant protein modifications.

site prediction plus proteomic analyses reveal a stringent list of ck1-responsive proteins
a second independent line of evidence supporting this interpretation comes from the site prediction results . among the phospho-sites upregulated upon ck1tau overexpression, a significant overrepresentation  of predicted human ck1ϵ sites was observed , further substantiating the biological activity and specificity of ck1tau. strikingly, a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted ck <dig> target sites  upregulated upon ck1tau overexpression are shared with the dataset acquired with the wild-type ck <dig> allele . compared with only three predicted ck <dig> sites  that are upregulated in only one of the overexpression lines, this result indicates that this list consists of bona fide ck <dig> targets. of the  <dig> genes encoding the parent proteins for the phospho-sites that were upregulated upon overexpression of both or one ck <dig> allele,  <dig> are present in publically available micro-array data from o. tauri <cit> . interestingly, all  <dig> exhibit diurnal expression profiles .

list of ck <dig> sites based on site prediction that are present in the phospho-preoteome observed in this study and  <cit> . parent proteins are listed for each peptide, along with their closest homolog in the human genome. results are listed based on 1) their presence in significantly differentially regulated sites, and 2) goodness of homology to closest human ortholog identified by blast searches. e values  and maximum identity  are based on ncbi blast. *this peptide is identified in three different phosphorylation states , and all three are upregulated upon overexpression of either allele. **  <cit> , effects on period  and/or amplitude  upon knock-down in human cells. ***  <cit> , rhythmic expression in following mouse cell types: liver , aorta , brown adipose , adrenal gland , distal colon , heart , kidney , nih3t <dig> , brain stem , scn , lung , hypothalamus , pituitary , skeletal muscle .

the most stringent set of candidates, upregulated in both ck <dig> overexpression lines, and additionally part of a predicted ck <dig> target sequence, consist of  <dig> o. tauri peptides from  <dig> proteins. unfortunately,  <dig> peptides stem from unknown and unannotated proteins meaning that either no significant homology is found with any other known protein, or that the gene models for these proteins are incorrect. to test whether these  <dig> stringently verified ck1-responsive target sites might relate to evolutionarily conserved clock-relevant target proteins, all o. tauri parent protein sequences were compared to the human proteome. half of these returned significant  homology  and of these  <dig> human proteins, two are kinases  and three are proteins containing ankyrin repeats .

such kinases are potentially involved in mediating functional cellular circadian outputs and thus might be expected to be regulated in turn by a hub kinase like ck <dig>  <cit> . this observation also agrees with the prevailing view of richly interconnected kinase networks, rather than the linear signal transduction pathways in the older literature, and could go some way to explaining how ck <dig> inhibition as well as overexpression induces a long-period phenotype, as both treatments may be expected to have pleiotropic downstream effects on multiple pathways, thereby compromising cellular timekeeping function.

ankyrin repeats are solenoid protein domains involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . although more common in eukaryotes, these do exist across all domains of life  <cit> . ankyrin repeats are identified in proteins involved with transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and ion transport  <cit> . as  <dig> out of the  <dig> most stringent hits resulting from this and a previous study contain ankyrin repeats, it is likely that ck <dig> regulates these protein interactions and their signalling activity. the broad conservation of ankyrin repeats and kinase proteins implies that the evolutionary basis of conserved ck1-mediated timekeeping mechanisms could rely on these classes of proteins.

to further substantiate that the protein in listed in table  <dig> contain clock-relevant ck <dig> targets, we looked for the closest human homologs in a genome-wide microrna screen  <cit>  for clock-relevant genes in human cells, using biogps  <cit> . ten out of fifteen of the proteins listed in table  <dig> have an effect on clock amplitude  and/or period  when knocked down in human cells , compared to  <dig> to 25% hit rate in the original paper. in addition, transcription of most of the closest mouse homologs was found to be clock-regulated in a wide range of tissues . combined, these results indicate a role in sustaining wild-type circadian rhythms across taxa for the ck <dig> targets identified here in o. tauri.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here and in previous work provide solid proof for the notion that ck <dig> targets can be conserved across domains of life, and include important signalling proteins. mammalian homologs of the targets identified here are involved in cellular timekeeping, and future work should investigate the functional cellular and chronobiological consequences ck <dig> activity on these conserved target proteins.
