BACKGROUND
most known genome browsers, such as ncbi genome  <cit>  and craig venter's genome browsers  <cit> , were built for consensus sequences from multiple individuals to construct a reference human genome. examples of haplotype genome browsers are ncbi, ucsc  <cit> , ensembl  <cit> , and venter genome browsers. recently, the first asian  diploid genome database was published, containing analysis and browsing facilities  <cit> . there are a number of general purpose genome annotation servers. they include entrez gene  <cit> , ensembl genes, omim  <cit>  disease associations, hapmap  <cit> , snpedia  <cit> , and genetic variations of several individual genomes such as venter  <cit> , watson  <cit> , yh , and na <dig>   <cit> . we have developed an individual genome variation analysis and browsing server  for the first korean personal genome sequence .

this server is useful to analyze a diploid human genome produced to study the complex features of human genetic variations. the system integrated multiple variation information such as venter, watson, yh, dbsnp, and hapmap genotypes as well as gene information. hence, users can comparatively study the genotypes in human. gevab also provides information for snps, short indels, and svs on the koref genome. gevab has two parts: genome variation analysis and genome mapping.

materials and methods
data source
koref data were generated using the illumina ga and resulted in  <dig>  gigabase  of sequence .

using the maq   <cit>  program, these sequences were aligned to the ncbi human genome reference . in total,  <dig> % of the ncbi reference genome was covered with an average of  <dig> -fold depth .

database and browser software
in the gevab korean genome variation browsing part, the consensus genome sequence and genetic variants include snps, short indels, and svs can be displayed. gevab used gbrowse  <cit>  developed by gmod  <cit>  for variation viewing, and the genome map browser part was developed by kobic.

analysis of koref
from the koref genome sequence,  <dig>  millions snps were identified and validated using illumina  <dig> m-duo and affy  <dig>  beadchip. we identified  <dig>  short indels . indels that co-occurred within a window size of  <dig> bp were filtered out, since they were primarily from length polymorphisms in homopolymeric tracts of a or t. using paired-end reads, we found  <dig> deletions and  <dig> inversion structural variants  in the range of  <dig> ~ <dig> kb. in addition, we detected  <dig> insertion events in the range of 175~ <dig> bp. these insertions are present in the koref genome but absent in the ncbi reference genome. mysql and php, python, and ajax were used in database construction and interface utility.

RESULTS
features of gevab
the gevab has genome variation analysis and genome map browser parts. the genome variation analysis part contains external public data sources, including the reference sequence of the human genome , the ensembl gene annotation, the entrez gene annotations, dbsnp ver.  <dig>  <cit> , omim annotations, and snp frequencies of the hapmap population as well as genotype, indel, and structure variation of the koref. it is also integrated with other individual snp variants such as james watson's, craig venter's, and yanghuang's genotypes . these external data sets are coordinated with the ncbi reference genome. a search can be done by putting in a genome location, a gene symbol, a refseq id, a dbsnp id, or an ensembl gene id. when the user searches gevab with a query, a graphical view of a chromosome ideogram and contigs are displayed. the gene locations within the  <dig> mb region centered on the query are also represented. for the displayed region in our browser, users can also download data with gff or fasta format ftp://ftp.kobic.re.kr/pub/kobic-koreangenome/.

gevab's map browser
the genome map browser provides reads mapping and quality information obtained from a personal genome project. a search can be done by chromosomal position. the width of a displayed region can be controlled. the browser also has zoom in and out and left and right movement functions.

when a user a chooses  <dig> bp window size or longer, the browser shows a graphical view with forward and reverse pair-end reads in dark and light green, and single reads in red ). for shorter than  <dig> bp window size, the browser is converted to a text mode that additionally shows quality information of mapped reads ).

gevab's variation browser
to study genome variations, a genome variation browser is more useful than a genome map browser. as an example, if a user is interested in the "noc2l" gene, s/he can get koref, watson, yh, and venter genome variation information through the variation browser part .

koref data access
the koref database is developed and maintained by kobic . the database contains all the raw and processed data of koref, including koref consensus sequence, genetic variants, and short read alignments. these data are available for downloading. the koref data have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive .

CONCLUSIONS
gevab contains all the raw and processed data of a korean genome sequence, variants, and annotation. gevab provides open and public access to all data of an individual personal diploid genome.

the variation browser part was designed to present genetic variant evidence, including the position, number, and status of reads, gc content, and several mapping information. these provide valuable detailed information such as comparison and validation of genetic variations to further communities for sequencing individual genome.
