BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae  is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis and otitis media. it colonizes the human nasopharynx asymptomatically, but can spread to the middle ear and lungs, or penetrate the epithelial cells and enter the bloodstream leading to invasive disease. worldwide s. pneumoniae is responsible for > <dig>  m cases of invasive disease annually and up to 11% of all deaths in children  <cit> .

adherence of the pneumococcus to the nasopharyngeal epithelium is essential to successful colonization and constitutes the first step in the invasive route of this pathogen. previously, pneumococcal adherence and invasion has been studied by gene expression analyses using rt-pcr  <cit>  or microarrays  <cit> . despite the identification of several key adherence factors, including pneumococcal surface adhesin a , pneumococcal serine repeat protein , choline binding proteins , pilus protein , plasminogen- and fibronectin-binding proteins , pneumococcal adherence and virulence factor a and b   <cit> , our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pneumococcal adherence and invasion remains incomplete. our research aims to improve our understanding of these mechanisms.

we measured variation in the adherence of two pneumococcal strains  to an epithelial cell line from the human pharynx . we also examined the pathogen-host interaction in each of these two strains with electron microscopy. next, we studied the genome-wide transcriptional response of s. pneumoniae as it adheres to and invades the d <dig> cells in vitro. we did this by comparing transcription profiles of pneumococcal strains exposed to either d <dig> cells or simple broth, and by comparing transcription profiles of pneumococci that successfully adhered to d <dig> cells to those that did not. these studies support the role of known adherence determinants and identified potential novel determinants, some of which have no predicted function. using deletion mutagenesis, we also demonstrate the possible functional relevance of five of these genes.

methods
pneumococcal strains
tigr <dig>  a serotype  <dig> clinical isolate taken from blood, and g <dig>  a serotype 19f isolate from human sputum, were routinely grown as previously described  <cit> . colonies were visualized in a stereoscope with transmitted light as previously described  <cit>  and only strains that were transparent in phenotype were used in this study. viable counts were performed to determine the exact number of cfu per micro-titer well to be used in each experiment.

in vitro adherence assay
detroit  <dig>  cells, human pharyngeal carcinoma epithelial cells, were purchased from the american type culture collection  and grown and maintained as previously described  <cit> . adherence of s. pneumoniae to d <dig> cells was assessed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, d <dig> cells  were seeded in 96-well tissue culture treated plates  and grown to confluence. the final cell yield was  <dig>  x  <dig> cells/well after 6 days of incubation resulting in a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> . monolayers were washed once with  <dig> μl/well of minimal essential medium with eagle’s salts  without l-glutamine and supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum . to the washed monolayer of each well,  <dig> μl of emem was added, followed by  <dig> μl/well of bacterial suspension . plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator to allow for adherence then washed  <dig> x with phosphate-buffered saline  with  <dig> % bovine serum albumin  to remove non-adherent pneumococci. a 65 μl volume of thye ,  <dig> % agar and  <dig> %  <dig> ,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride , was added and the plates were incubated overnight at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. the number of colonies of s. pneumoniae adhering to d <dig> cells was counted using an automated colony counter  and adherence was expressed as  <dig> x  per well. these counts are inclusive of bacteria that were internalized within the cells. values for  <dig> replicate wells were averaged and  <dig> independent experiments were performed. differences in adherence capacity between tigr <dig> and g <dig> were tested by student’s t-test.

for microarray experiments, aliquots  of pneumococcal tigr <dig> and g <dig> strains containing  <dig> bacteria were centrifuged, washed in pbs, and re-suspended in 15 ml of emem. confluent d <dig> cells, grown in 175 cm <dig> cell culture flasks , were inoculated with these strains and incubated for 2 h at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. non-adherent bacteria  were removed and collected by differential centrifugation to remove eukaryotic cellular debris. epithelial cells were washed 3x with pbs and then treated immediately with 10 ml of rnaprotect . for experiments with g <dig>  adherent bacteria were dissociated from host cells by treatment with trypsin-edta; for tigr <dig>  which adhered and invaded to d <dig> cells extremely efficiently, dissociation was achieved by lysis with  <dig> %  saponin in pbs followed by sonication using 5 s pulses for 1 min. bacteria were subsequently harvested by differential centrifugation . control bacteria, which were not exposed to host cells, were suspended in emem medium and then prepared in parallel and treated identically to adherent and non-adherent bacteria. they were also treated with 10 ml of rnaprotect to minimize rna metabolism and degradation. pellets were stored at −80°c.

the difference in treatments between g <dig> and tigr <dig> stems from the chronology of the experiments. we began by testing the adherence and expression of the g <dig> strain. then we attempted to apply the same method to recover the adherent population of the tigr <dig> strain, but we were unable to retrieve enough tigr <dig> bacteria for extraction of sufficient amounts of rna. a significant proportion of bacteria remained lodged in the pharyngeal cells . liberation of tigr <dig> pneumococci therefore required selective lysis of eukaryotic cells by saponin treatment and sonication. for various reasons, we did not go back and repeat all g <dig> experiments, however it should be noted that prior to any detachment treatment all bacteria were incubated with 10 ml of rnaprotect  for immediate stabilization of rna and to minimize rna degradation. this incubation should prevent any change in bacterial rna profiles during further treatments.

invasion assay
internalization of bacteria into d <dig> cells was assessed by a gentamicin assay as previously described  <cit> . briefly, confluent d <dig> cells were inoculated with s. pneumoniae as described in the adherence assay. after 1 h and 45 min incubation, the cells were treated with  <dig> μg/ml of gentamicin for 15 min to kill extracellular bacteria. monolayers were washed  <dig> times with pbs with  <dig> % bsa to remove non-adherent pneumococci and any residual gentamicin. as in the adherence assay, monolayers were overlaid with thye agar with 1% ttc and incubated overnight at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  internalized bacteria  were quantified using an automated colony counter . differences in invasion capacity between tigr <dig> and g <dig> were tested by student’s t-test.

pneumococcal strains tigr <dig> and g <dig> strains were tested for gentamicin sensitivity using gentamicin discs of  <dig> μg . both strains had comparable gentamicin inhibition zone diameters of  <dig>  mm for tigr <dig> and 10 mm for g <dig>  the time and concentration of antibiotics used in these experiments were optimized for the d <dig> cell line. preliminary time-course experiments by rajam et al. <cit>   showed that a 200 μg/ml concentration of gentamicin was sufficient to kill extracellular pneumococci in 15 minutes. longer time-points resulted in gentamicin penetrating the detroit  <dig> cells, which resulted in internal killing rather than extracellular killing.

electron microscopy
d <dig> cells, grown to confluence in 175 cm <dig> cell culture flasks , were inoculated as described above with  <dig> bacteria . after a 2-h incubation step, monolayers were washed with em buffer  and gently layered with  <dig> % buffered glutaraldehyde . the cells were scraped with a cell scraper  within 1 min and the cell suspension was centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 10 min at 24°c. the cell pellets were then incubated for 1 h at 4°c to fix them. pellets were washed once with em buffer and stored at 4°c. d <dig> cell specimens were embedded in a mixture of eponate  <dig> and araldite  <dig>  <cit>  and thin sections of plastic-embedded cells were examined by electron microscopy.

rna preparation
total rna was isolated from three populations of rna stabilized bacteria: adherent, non-adherent and bacteria growing freely in emem. total rna was isolated using trizol  in a lysing matrix containing silica beads and a fastprep instrument . purification was done using i) phase separation with trizol and ii) column exclusion with the rneasy mini kit  according to the manufacturers instructions. contaminating genomic dna was removed by dnase treatment. rna concentration was determined using the nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  and the integrity was assessed using the prokaryote and eukaryote total rna chips on the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . good quality rnas were amplified using genisphere’s senseamp kit  to increase the yield of rna for microarray experiments.

probe preparation and microarray hybridization
the s. pneumoniae microarrays used in this study consisted of  <dig> 70-mer oligonucleotide probes from the genomes of  <dig> pneumococcal strains  as well as  <dig> amplicons and  <dig> oligonucleotides  from arabidopsis thaliana which served as negative controls. all probes were aligned against the hg <dig> version of the human genome using blastn and no significant hits were obtained. probes were printed 5x on aminosilane-coated slides . the microarrays  were kindly provided by the pathogen functional genomics resource center  at the j. craig venter institute and experiments were performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> μg of the total rnas to be compared were reverse transcribed into single-stranded cdna using  <dig> u superscript ii reverse transcriptase ,  <dig> μg random hexamers , 1x first strand buffer , 10 mm dithiothreitol ,  <dig>  mm datp,  <dig>  mm dctp,  <dig>  mm dgtp,  <dig>  mm dttp and  <dig>  mm of aminoallyl-modified nucleotide . the mixture was incubated overnight at 42°c and the reaction stopped by addition of  <dig> μl  <dig>  m edta and 1 m naoh. amine-modified cdna was purified using qiaquick pcr purification kit  followed by chemical labeling with cy3- or cy5-nhs-ester fluorescent dyes  in a final step. slides were pre-hybridized in a 50 ml solution of 5x ssc,  <dig> % sds and 1% bsa for 30 min at 42°c, washed 4x in water and once in isopropanol, then dried by brief centrifugation. labeled probes were re-suspended in hybridization buffer  and hybridized to the microarray slides in a 42°c water bath for 16–20 h. slides were washed twice in a low stringency buffer  at 55°c for 5 min, twice in a medium stringency buffer  at room temperature for 5 min and finally twice in a high stringency buffer  at room temperature for 5 min, and then dried by brief centrifugation. synthesized cdna from each rna sample from three independent cell cultures was hybridized on three separate microarray slides , and independently synthesized cdna from each of these same rna samples was hybridized in a repeat dye-swap experiment  to test technical reproducibility. additional file  <dig> summarizes the experimental design.

data collection, normalization, and analysis
dried slides were scanned using a genepix 4000b dual-color laser scanner  and saved as two independent 16-bit tiff files corresponding to the two labeled probes . data were analyzed using the tm <dig> microarray software suite  <cit> . spot intensities were quantified using spotfinder v <dig> . <dig>  the two channels were normalized using the iterative log mean centering algorithm implemented in the midas software  and the fluorescence ratios were calculated from the normalized values. genes with significant changes in expression were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays  test implemented in the mev software  with ∆ =  <dig>  for tigr <dig> and ∆ =  <dig>  for g <dig> . only genes that had ≥  <dig> individual high quality data points were included in the analysis. a cutoff of mean fold change of ≥  <dig> was used. this gene list was supplemented with genes that did not meet the fold threshold value but appeared to be co-regulated as a part of an operon. up and down-regulated genes were classified into meaningful functional categories using ease . ease statistically calculates the probability that a biological theme  is over-represented in the gene list of interest compared to the representation of that theme on the microarray. in our study, p-values of < <dig>  were considered significant . significance was determined for each strain separately.

sam two-class paired analysis  was used to identify genes exhibiting statistically significant differences in gene expression between adherent/medium-treated control and non-adherent/medium-treated control. a ratio of these gene expression ratios  was calculated for these significantly regulated genes and an arbitrary threshold of  <dig>  fold change was set on the ratio index.

validation of microarray data using real-time qrt-pcr
reverse transcription was carried out using the quantitect reverse transcription kit  in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, 1 μg of total rna was incubated in genomic dna  wipeout buffer  and rnase-free water and incubated at 42°c for 2 min to remove contaminating gdna. the cdna was synthesized from the rna using quantiscript reverse transcriptase, quantiscript rt buffer  and a primer mix consisting of long random primers and oligo-dt. the reaction was incubated at 42°c for 15 min and then at 95°c for 3 min to inactivate the quantiscript rt. quantitative real-time pcr was performed as previously described  <cit> . dilutions of the cdna  were used as template in a reaction containing 2x quantitect sybr green mix , rnase free water and gene-specific primers . the qrt-pcr was conducted using an abi7900ht machine . the reactions were denatured at 95°c for 15 min followed by amplification with 45 cycles of 94°c for 15 s, 55°c for 30 s and 72°c for 30 s. the qrt-pcr data was analyzed using a comparative cycle threshold  method  <cit> . the average ct values of a test sample were compared to that of a control sample . the Δct was normalized to genes that did not exhibit any significant change in expression as identified by the microarray experiments: an average of sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig>  and sp_ <dig> . each sample of each biological replicate was tested three times.

rna sequencing
the transcriptome of s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> adhering to d <dig> host cells was determined using rna-seq on the illumina genome analyzer platform as per the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly,  <dig> μg of total rna was partially depleted of rrna using the microbeexpress kit  then fragmented in a buffer with divalent cations at 94°c for 5 min. double-stranded cdna was synthesized from the fragmented rna using superscript ii  and random primers. the fragment ends were repaired using t <dig> dna polymerase and the dna polymerase klenow fragment in the presence dntps to remove 3′ overhangs and fill in 5′ overhangs. subsequently, a 3′ “a” overhang was added using a dna polymerase klenow fragment lacking 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity in the presence of datp. illumina adaptors with a single 3′ “t” overhang were ligated to both ends of the dna fragments. cdna of the appropriate size range was gel purified and amplified, and illumina sequencing conducted with unpaired reads  <dig> nt in length.  <dig> , <dig> high quality sequencing reads were obtained and 95% of them mapped to the reference s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> complete genome sequence using the eland alignment algorithm . the reads and alignment data were deposited at the ncbi gene expression omnibus  database under accession number: ge <dig> 

construction of knockout mutants
in selecting genes for knockout experiments, the features we sought were one or more of the following:  significant up-regulation on contact with epithelial cells in the microarray experiments;  up-regulation in the more adherent strain ;  ratio index  /  ≥  <dig>  in both strains;  conservation among the sequenced strains of pneumococci with the exception of known regions of diversity;  no prior existing experimental evidence of association with pneumococcal adhesion;  large hypothetical proteins; and  plausibility of knocking out a gene that was part of an operon without causing a polar effect. preparation of mutagenic constructs, restriction digestion, ligation and transformation were performed using the pcr ligation mutagenesis strategy  previously described  <cit> . briefly, two pairs of gene-specific primers, j1/j <dig> and j3/j <dig>  were used to amplify the upstream and downstream flanking regions of a number of target genes. j <dig> and j <dig> were modified to contain kpni and saci restriction sites. a third pair of primers, kanf and rpslr, were used to amplify a  <dig> -kb positive/negative selection cassette kan-rpsl+ that was previously introduced in s. pneumoniae strain 403 j  <cit> . the kan-rpsl+ cassette was comprised of a kanamycin resistant marker  and a counter-selectable marker rpsl+ which conferred dominant streptomycin sensitivity in a streptomycin resistant pneumococcal strain. all the primers used in this study are listed in additional file  <dig>  amplification proceeded for 34 cycles as follows: denaturation at 95°c for 30 s, annealing at 62°c  for 30 s, and elongation at 72°c for 1 min. amplicons were purified, digested overnight at 37°c using kpni or saci restriction enzymes and purified again to completely inactivate the enzyme. the  <dig> digested pcr products were then ligated using  <dig> μg of t <dig> dna ligase  in ligase buffer at room temperature for 2 h.

transformation
genetic transformation of the ligation products into s. pneumoniae strain tigr4-z <dig>  was performed as follows. a series of transformation stocks were prepared by growing s. pneumoniae in competence media  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator to an od600nm of  <dig> , and freezing down the cultures in 20% glycerol. a 1 ml frozen aliquot of transformation stocks was thawed out and grown in competence media to exponential phase  at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. the cells were subsequently diluted in competence medium  and transformed with  <dig> μl of the ligation products and 500 ng of the competence peptide csp- <dig> and incubated for 2 h at 37°c. cells were then plated on blood agar plates with antibiotics and incubated for up to 48 h. s. pneumoniae strain ali  <dig>  containing a kan-rpsl+ cassette in place of the ali gene, was used as the positive control and a no-dna control plate was included to check for background resistance activities in the recipient cells. transformants were selected based on their resistance to kanamycin  and susceptibility to streptomycin . confirmation of gene replacement was performed using colony pcr. individual colonies that were knr and sms were used as template in a pcr reaction using two pairs of primers . presence of a pcr product of the expected size was indicative of the presence of the cassette in the mutant strain and at the correct location. colonies with the correct size were re-grown in thye broth and a glycerol stock was kept at −80°c for use in adherence assays. the adherence assay to test the ability of mutant strains to bind to d <dig> cells was similar to that described above.

hemolytic activity of tigr <dig> wild type and ∆sp <dig> isogenic mutant
s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> wild type and ∆sp_ <dig> were grown to an od600nm of  <dig>  in thye. the cells were centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min, and the cell pellets were washed once with pbs and re-suspended in 2 ml of pbs. bacteria were sonicated for 5 min at 50% duty cycle using an ultrasonicator  in an ice container. cell lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for 30 min at 4°c and the supernatants  were transferred to a clean tube. serial dilutions of the cell extracts in pbs  were prepared. human erythrocytes were washed twice in cold pbs and were added to the cell extracts to yield a final concentration of 2% . the suspension was incubated at 37°c for 30 min then centrifuged gently at 800 g for 10 min. supernatants were transferred to a clean microtiter plate and the absorbance of released hemoglobin was determined at 540 nm using a microplate spetrophotometer . the positive control was saponin, a known hemolytic agent, and the negative control was  <dig> % dimethyl sulfoxide . the relative hemolytic activity  at each concentration was determined using a control containing 2%  erythrocytes and deionized water that was considered as 100% hemolysis. all experiments were carried out in triplicate.

rt-pcr confirmation of the sp_ <dig> - ply operon
total rna was isolated from s. pneumoniae strain tigr <dig> grown in thye using the qiagen rneasy mini kit  and treated with dnase on column and in solution. reverse transcription was performed using superscript ii reverse transcriptase  following the manufacturer’s instructions. total rna  was incubated with each of  <dig> gene-specific primers  at 65°c for 5 min and quick chilled on ice. to this mixture was added 5x first-strand buffer and  <dig>  m dtt, and the samples were incubated at 42°c for 2 min. superscript ii rt was then added and the samples were incubated at 42°c for 50 min, followed by enzyme inactivation by heating to 70°c for 15 min. the  <dig> cdnas were pooled and pcr was performed with neb taq 2x master mix , following the standard protocol and using combinations of gene-specific primers spanning various regions within the pneumolysin operon .

RESULTS
pneumococcal adhesion to and internalization within d <dig> pharyngeal cells
adhesion of s. pneumoniae to d <dig> pharyngeal epithelial cell monolayers was assayed in vitro, and invasion was assessed based on gentamicin selection for intracellular bacteria. two pneumococcal strains were tested, tigr <dig> and g <dig>  the mean adherence capacity to d <dig> cells was significantly higher  for tigr <dig>  than g <dig> . this translated to  <dig> % of the inoculum for tigr <dig> and  <dig> % of the inoculum for g <dig>  the internalization capacity also varied significantly  between the  <dig> strains; 233 cfu/well ±  <dig> for tigr <dig>  and 3 cfu/well for g <dig> . when we analyzed the growth patterns of tigr <dig> and g <dig> during the 2-h assay, we found that some growth occurred in emem but the differences were not statistically significant up to 2 h . we adjusted the adherence and invasion calculations for growth, resulting in values of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for tigr <dig> and g <dig>  respectively. similarly, invasion was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for tigr <dig> and g <dig>  respectively.

these interactions were visualized using electron microscopy. unlike g <dig>  tigr <dig> pneumococci were found in larger numbers adjacent to and within epithelial cells . pneumococci attached to the monolayer of epithelial cells either as micro-colonies  or as single cells , and this was accompanied by the formation of elongations of the epithelial cell out towards and around the bacterial cells. the images indicated that pneumococci were internalized into host cell vacuoles .

since tigr <dig> and g <dig> differed significantly in their ability to adhere to and invade d <dig> cells, we sought to determine genetic differences between the strains. direct blastp analysis  of tigr <dig> and g <dig> proteins predicted from the whole genomes revealed that over 10% of each strain’s proteins are unique with respect to the other strain . representation of shared and unique proteins along the genomes revealed a number of strain-specific genomic islands encoding proteins potentially involved in the adherence and invasion processes .

gene expression analyses
we analyzed the transcriptome of both pneumococcal strains upon exposure and adherence to human pharyngeal cells. dna microarrays were used to analyze the gene expression profiles of s. pneumoniae in the following two ways:  transcription profiles of bacteria adhering to host cells were compared with those of bacteria grown in tissue culture medium in the absence of host cells , and  transcriptional profiles of adherent bacteria were compared to those of non-adherent bacteria exposed to the host cells . a schematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of gene expression in adherent bacteria compared to culture medium-treated bacteria: after analysis of statistical significance, application of a 2-fold cutoff on expression ratios and addition of genes likely to be co-transcribed , tigr <dig> differentially regulated  <dig> genes while g <dig> regulated  <dig> genes . the regulation ratios varied from  <dig> - <dig> . eighty-four genes were commonly regulated by the adherent population of the two strains. differentially expressed genes were classified into functional categories . categories that were significantly over-represented  included ‘cellular processes’, ‘cell envelope’, ‘transport and binding’ and ‘fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism’ .

comparison of adherent and non-adherent pneumococci incubated in the presence of host cells: we hypothesized that not only do bacteria remodel their transcriptome on sensing the presence of host cells, but that the degree of adjustment varies within the individual bacterial cells in the population eventually determining the outcome - successful attachment to host cells. since we did not directly hybridize adherent bacteria against non-adherent bacteria on the same array, we compared the ratio of the adherent vs. control against the ratio of non-adherent vs. control . this is mathematically equivalent to the ratio of adherent vs. non-adherent. to increase the sensitivity to meaningful functional differences between adherent and non-adherent bacteria as opposed to between adherent and culture medium-treated bacteria, we used an arbitrary cutoff of  <dig>  fold change on the ratio index. using this ratio cutoff and a statistical test of significance,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially regulated in tigr <dig> and g <dig>  respectively. of these,  <dig> were coordinately expressed  in both strains . we infer that these commonly regulated genes are the basic set of genes associated with successful functional adherence.

successful adhesion was associated with increases in the transcription of  <dig> genes in a strain-specific manner . a few of the genes that were up-regulated in tigr <dig> alone correspond to genes identified in the previous section and include: adhesins , transporters , fatty acid metabolism genes and several hypothetical proteins. genes that code for hypothetical proteins were the most highly represented. these results provide a novel approach to the analysis of genes whose expression is important for intimate adherence and/or invasion of pneumococci to epithelial cells.

qrt-pcr confirmation of gene regulation
a subset of 21 s. pneumoniae genes were selected for qrt-pcr validation of expression levels based on: i) a range of gene expression values i.e., up-, down- and non-regulated and ii) biological interest. the data were analyzed in separate groups for each strain and for adherent and non-adherent phenotypes. each sample of each biological replicate was analyzed three times. in all four groups there was a strong positive correlation  between the microarray results and the qrt-pcr , supporting the validity of the microarray method. the qrt-pcr results from the tigr <dig> adherent sample were further analyzed using the rna-seq method. both techniques provide an absolute measure of the transcript abundance, with low abundance transcripts displaying a low average coverage in rna-seq and a high cycle threshold  in qrt-pcr. additional file  <dig> shows the expected logarithmic correlation between the ct observed in qrt-pcr and the average coverage observed in rna-seq for each gene. the complete list of rna-seq results for genes in the tigr <dig> adherent sample are listed in additional file  <dig> 

adherence characteristics of wild type tigr <dig> and isogenic knockout mutants
on the basis of the microarray results a list of the most highly attractive targets for further investigation was generated . of these, nine regions -  <dig> individual genes and  <dig> operons - were selected for knockout experiments . mutants were created using insertion-deletion mutagenesis whereby target genes were replaced with a kanamycin resistance-streptomycin sensitive cassette and then incorporated into the genome by genetic transformation and homologous recombination. three mutants: sp_ <dig> , sp_ <dig> , and sp_ <dig> – sp_ <dig> , were never obtained despite several attempts at transformation, suggesting that the genes might be essential for survival. the remaining six mutant strains exhibited a reduction in adherence to d <dig> cells when compared to the wild type strain  . three of the mutants, the pilus pathogenicity islet , sp_ <dig>  and sp_ <dig>  were markedly attenuated in adherence. the adherence capacity of two other positive controls - Δsrta and Δpava - was reduced by 60% and 40%, respectively. the sp_ <dig>  sp_ <dig> and sp_ <dig> knockouts showed residual adherence. growth of the mutants and wild type strain in emem were compared  and the adherence phenotypes were independent of the growth rates of the mutants.

characterization of sp_1922
the Δsp_ <dig> mutant was the most thoroughly attenuated in adherence . sp_ <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein that is present in all pneumococcal genomes published to date. the protein length , location, and sequence is identical  in all of the sequenced pneumococcal genomes presented in the strepneumo sybil system . by blastp analysis , this gene is conserved in all streptococcal species and is a core gene in several other bacterial species e.g., moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and shigella sp. conservation of the gene suggests that it is an important bacterial protein, yet its function is unknown. sp_ <dig> in s. pneumoniae is located immediately downstream of the pneumolysin gene , which encodes a major pneumococcal toxin that has been implicated in adherence and invasion in several studies  <cit> . there are a number of repeat elements  in the intergenic region between ply and sp_ <dig>  this region appears to be unique to pneumococci. sp_ <dig> is predicted by the bepipred software  to carry a b-cell epitope. our microarray results showed that sp_ <dig> – sp_ <dig> were all up-regulated in tigr <dig> upon contact with host cells and down-regulated in the less adherent g <dig> strain. illumina-based rna sequencing  data was generated from tigr <dig> adherent samples . rna-seq coverage revealed that sp_ <dig> is most likely transcriptionally linked to ply  in a manner consistent with genes organized in an operon .

to confirm this prediction, the five-gene operon was analyzed with reverse transcriptase pcr . using primers spanning various regions within the operon , rt-pcr showed that hypothetical proteins sp_ <dig>  sp_ <dig>  sp_ <dig> and sp_ <dig>  were transcribed in an operon with the gene encoding pneumolysin  . due to paucity of the original tigr <dig> adherent rna samples, the rt-pcr experiments were performed on rna samples from tigr <dig> grown in thye medium.

discussion
adherence of s. pneumoniae to the human nasopharynx is a critical process and first step that enables the pneumococcus to survive and infect the host. in some cases, the adherent pneumococci penetrate the mucosal epithelium of the nasopharynx and cause systemic disease. the factors that facilitate the transition from adherence to internalization are not well known. we examined the adherence and invasion of pneumococci by using a human pharyngeal epithelial cell line, d <dig>  which is an in vitro model for adherence and for the purpose of this study, mimics the natural site of pneumococcal colonization. our results show that s. pneumoniae tigr <dig> strain was more capable of adhering to and being internalized within epithelial cells than g <dig>  this difference was not due to differences in growth patterns, susceptibility to gentamicin, or the g <dig> strain being more toxic to d <dig> cells since the ems showed healthy cells and intact monolayers. internalization, however, appeared to occur via a similar route in the two strains. large vacuoles containing pneumococci were observed after infection with either strain. this observation opens up the possibility that pneumococci  are not strictly extracellular pathogens as has been traditionally assumed. in support of this finding, peppoloni et al. showed that the encapsulated strain tigr <dig> was protected from intracellular killing, albeit in a different cell line, murine microgial cell line bv <dig>  <cit> . the same observation was made by briles et al. who found tigr <dig> embedded within granulocyte-filled nasal crypts in the sub-mucosa  <cit> . rajam et al. <cit>  demonstrated that the internalization of three pneumococcal strains was in the range of 20-29%, a figure that is comparable to what we found in our study. our results differ from that of the seminal work by cundell et al. <cit> , who showed low invasion capacity of pneumococci. it is worth noting that the invasion assays were performed on a different cell line , a lower gentamicin concentration , and the time before gentamicin addition was also significantly shorter  perhaps minimizing internalization. the observation that s. pneumoniae invasion is cell-type specific has been previously documented  <cit> , with d <dig> cells exhibiting extensive invasion compared to other cell types.

the phenotypic differences in tigr <dig> and g <dig> can be explained, at least in part, by differences in their genomes and transcriptomes. genomic differences between the two strains were mainly located in the regions of genomic diversity  . for example, tigr <dig>  which was superior in adherence and invasion, contained pathogenicity islands rlr and psrp-secy2a <dig>  previous studies have shown that strains lacking the rlr islet were attenuated in their ability to adhere to eukaryotic cells and to cause invasive disease  <cit>  and presence of the psrp-secy2a <dig> gene cluster has been shown to correlate with the propensity of bacteria to cause invasive pneumococcal disease  <cit> . these loci and the others  may therefore be relevant to tigr4’s interaction with the host but are dispensable in the g <dig> strain. the strain-specific contribution of certain genes to virulence has been demonstrated in other studies  <cit> . deletion of cbpa gene from the serotype  <dig> tigr <dig> strain reduced its virulence in a mouse pneumonia model; but had no effect on strains of serotypes  <dig>   <dig> and 19f  <cit> . similarly, deletion of ppma  in a mouse colonization model reduced adherence in tigr <dig> and a serotype  <dig> strain ntc <dig> but not in a serotype  <dig> strain, d <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the transcriptome of tigr <dig> and g <dig> revealed the following biological themes as being the most pronounced:

genes encoding cellular processes. genes coma-e, adca-c, and adcr, involved in inducing competence  <cit> , were all significantly up-regulated in g <dig> on contact with host cells but only slightly up-regulated in tigr <dig>  eleven bacteriocin-associated genes were also regulated in this strain, contributing to the high number of down-regulated genes encoding cellular processes. bacteriocin-encoding genes have previously been shown to be co-regulated with competence genes in some studies  <cit>  but not in others  <cit> . pneumolysin  was up-regulated in tigr <dig> but down-regulated in g <dig>  the toxin is important for disrupting the tight junctions between epithelial cells and allowing a portal of entry for pneumococcal invasion. data from thornton et al. <cit>  showed that ply induces transcription of host icam- <dig>  an epithelial cell adhesion molecule that plays a role in pneumococcal adherence. ply mutants have been shown to be attenuated in their ability to colonize the nasopharynx in mice  <cit> . in addition, ply mrna was shown to be more abundant in the nasopharynx than in blood using two pneumococcal strains, d <dig>  and wch <dig>   <cit> . recent data from price et al. revealed that ply is localized to the cell wall in a lyta-independent manner  <cit> . given the highly efficient attachment and invasion of epithelial cells by tigr <dig> compared to g <dig> in our experiments, we speculate that the strain-specific expression of ply might be partly responsible for the observed phenotypic differences, hence supporting the role of pneumolysin in adherence and invasion. the unique up-regulation of ply in tigr <dig> and the preferential up-regulation of quorum sensing systems in g <dig> suggest two different strategies for colonization in the nasopharynx that are consistent with the surface changes depicted by the electron micrographs . an alternative interpretation, which cannot be differentiated in these experiments, is that there are no strain-specific differences but that the observations made represent different stages of cellular infection. if this is the case, the progression through stages appears more rapid for tigr <dig> 

interestingly, four hypothetical genes located immediately upstream  and downstream  of the ply gene were expressed in exactly the same manner as ply in both strains suggesting that they might be transcriptionally linked. we performed rt-pcr experiments to confirm expression of sp_1922-sp_ <dig> as a single operon . further, yadav et al.  <cit>  have shown that sp_ <dig> and sp_ <dig> are implicated in the transport of ply from the cytosol to the cell wall compartment, supporting the likelihood of their co-expression. the four hypothetical genes in the ply operon represent interesting candidates for further study to determine their exact role in adherence. whether or not the box elements around this region control the expression of this operon is also a matter worth exploring in the future.

genes belonging to the cell envelope category. there was enhanced expression of the lic operon in both strains as has been shown by orihuela et al. <cit> , suggesting that bacteria were increasing phosphorylcholine levels on their cell wall, thereby enhancing adhesive interaction with host cells. tigr <dig> up-regulated the rlr pathogenicity islet genes encoding pneumococcal pili, as well as the glycosylated proteins within rd <dig> . genes in these regions have previously been shown to have adherence functions  <cit> . there were considerable differences in expression in sub-populations of bacteria within the same strain; pili, lic and psrp-secy2a <dig> operons were more highly expressed in the adherent sub-population as compared to the non-adherent sub-population, when in the presence of host cells.

genes encoding transport and binding proteins. genes belonging to the psa operon, a manganese abc transporter system, were significantly up-regulated in both strains. these genes have previously been implicated in pneumococcal pathogenesis, specifically adhesion  <cit> . phna, encoding an alkylphosphonate utilization protein transporter, as well as a gene encoding a putative membrane transporter , and a hypothetical gene  downstream of it were up-regulated in both strains. in e. coli, the phn operon consists of  <dig> genes that are regulated by the phosphate  system  <cit> . induction of phn genes in our study suggests that overcoming phosphate limitation might be important for adherence and invasion. interestingly, adhc , sp_ <dig>  and czcd  encoding a zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase, a merr family regulator, and a zinc efflux pump, respectively, were significantly up-regulated in tigr <dig>  adhc and the merr family regulator have previously been shown to be important for virulence  <cit> . in a separate study  <cit> , these genes appeared to be required for resistance to nitric oxide stress, but did not play a key role in nasopharyngeal colonization in vivo. nitric oxide is recognized as a key component of the innate immune response. nitric oxide can inhibit bacterial dna replication via the release of zinc from metalloproteins and can also hinder bacterial respiration. hence bacteria e.g. pneumococci, haemophilus influenzae and e. coli have developed nitric oxide resistance mechanisms such as the adhc-czcd system  <cit> . expression of these genes in our study is consistent with our earlier observation that a sub-population of bacteria penetrated the epithelial cells; the observed regulation might be an adaptation to the intracellular environment. it is conceivable that induction of ply by tigr <dig> resulted in epithelial damage, which in turn led to triggering of nitric oxide production by the host cells, placing bacteria under nitrosative stress. adhc  is up-regulated to reduce the nitric oxide, therefore allowing internalized bacteria to resist killing.

other regulated genes. genes encoding metabolism-associated proteins were differentially expressed upon adherence of pneumococci to d <dig> cells. these include genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, nucleotide, sugar, fatty acid and phospholipids metabolism. a number of the differentially regulated genes encoded hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown functions. many of these proteins are predicted to be > <dig> aa  and have signal peptides or other motifs indicating that they are likely to be functional surface localized proteins . these properties make them good candidates for further characterization of their utility as vaccine antigens.

our mutagenesis data showed that deletion of both sp_ <dig>  and the rlr islet, independently resulted in almost complete attenuation of adherence. though we expected the rlr mutant to be attenuated in adherence, the extent to which adherence was reduced  was surprising since it is known that strains without pili bind to epithelial cells, albeit less efficiently  <cit> . it is conceivable that sp_ <dig> and rlr might act in synergy or might be co-regulated and therefore deletion of one gene affects the function of the other. it has previously been shown that adherence via pili is coordinated with adherence by other adhesins  <cit> . deletion of the whole pilus islet in our study might have affected the regulation of some genes  outside the islet, sp_ <dig> included. on the other hand, deletion of sp_ <dig> totally abolishes all the adhesion seen in this in vitro model. of note, the knockout was carefully constructed to prevent interfering with ply, which is upstream of this gene. in addition, the activity of pneumolysin in the sp_ <dig> mutant was confirmed to be similar to that of the wild type using a hemolytic activity assay . we are tempted to speculate that this gene encodes the most important adhesin in this in vitro assay system. deletion of this gene probably changes an important adhesive property without which other adhesins cannot function. further investigations are needed to elucidate our findings.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel role for several pneumococcal genes in adherence to pharyngeal epithelial cells. this work therefore identifies a short list of genes that encode proteins that can be further evaluated as potential antimicrobial targets or non-capsular vaccine candidates if immunogenicity can be demonstrated in future studies.
