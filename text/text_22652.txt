BACKGROUND
the tousled  gene was first identified in the plant arabidopsisthaliana. recessive tsl mutants show defects in leaf and flower development  <cit> . this was proposed to be linked to a replicative defect during organogenesis, but it may also result from failure to protect the genome from dna damage , resulting in developmental aberrations  <cit> . animal homologs of tousled, known as tousled like kinases , are found from caenorhabditiselegans to mammals. they are generally considered as genes of metazoans and are not found in yeast, although they are present in unicellular trypanosomes  <cit> . in mammals their activity is cell cycle regulated with maximal activity found in the s-phase. after many years of study, only a few direct “interacting” substrates of tlks have been identified, namely the histone chaperone asf <dig>  <cit> , histone h <dig>  <cit> , rad <dig>  <cit> , and aurora b kinase  <cit> . as evident from their substrates, tlks play a major role in chromatin assembly  <cit> , transcription  <cit> , dna repair  <cit> , and condensation of chromosomes at mitosis  <cit> . in humans two structurally similar tlk genes  with several splice variants have been identified. a splice variant of tlk <dig>  tlk1b that lacks the first  <dig> amino acids was identified in our lab. tlk <dig> and tlk1b interact with similar substrates, are believed to have similar enzymatic functions and are often referred to as tlk1/1b. our previous studies have shown that translation of tlk1b is induced by dna damage through the activation of the mtor-eif4e pathway. we have shown that elevated expression of tlk1b promotes cell survival after irradiation  or doxorubicin  <cit>  and uv  <cit>  by facilitating dna repair and promoting chromatin assembly after repair. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of tlk1b renders mammalian cells sensitive to ir  <cit> . thus, the human homolog, tlk1b, has invoked interest because of its established role in cell survival after dna damage  <cit> . identification of rad <dig> as a substrate for tlk1/1b attributes a direct role of tlk1/1b in dna repair  <cit> . our previous work suggests that tlk1/1b’s chaperone activity, independent of its kinase activity, helps in the recruitment of rad <dig> at the break site. we had previously shown some evidence that tlk1/1b kinase activity is important for the dissociation of rad9-rad1-hus <dig>  complex from a double stranded break   <cit> .

rad <dig> plays a major role in dna repair, cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. aberrant rad <dig> expression has been linked to breast, lung, thyroid, skin and prostate tumorigenesis  <cit> . rad <dig> is a part of 9-1- <dig> heterotrimeric complex which is required for activation of atr. rad <dig>  rad <dig> or hus <dig> ko mice are embryonic lethal  <cit> . loss of rad <dig> produces a defect in atr signaling and increases the sensitivity of the cells towards genotoxic stress  <cit> . in response to replication stress rpa directs the clamp loader rad17–replication factor c  to load the 9-1- <dig> complex at the 5′ end of the double strand-single strand dna junctions  <cit> . chromatin-bound 9-1- <dig> complex acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of various dna repair proteins and polymerases at the dna damage break site. it ensures filling of gaps and efficient repair of dna  <cit> . recently it has been shown that 9-1- <dig> complex is required for the recruitment of wrn protein at stalled replication forks and this interaction is important for the fork recovery  <cit> . wrn belongs to the recq family of dna helicases. loss of wrn gives rise to a genetic disease known as werner syndrome . it is characterized by pre-mature ageing and pre-disposition to cancer  <cit> . cells derived from the ws patients show a prolonged s-phase, a reduced life-span, and an increase in genomic instability  <cit> . it has been shown that wrn stabilizes the stalled replication forks and the loss of wrn leads to the fork collapse and increase in dsbs that are repaired through recombination  <cit> . wrn interacts with the 9-1- <dig> complex to maintain genomic stability by preventing accumulation of dsbs at the damaged forks  <cit> .

activation of the dna damage induced checkpoint mediates rapid and transient inhibition of tlk activity. this transient inhibition in response to dna damage requires atm and chk <dig> function. chk <dig> directly phosphorylates tlk <dig> at s <dig> which is equivalent to s <dig> of tlk1b  <cit> . once tlk1/1b regains its kinase activity it phosphorylates rad <dig> at s <dig>  <cit>  and t <dig>  <cit> . rad <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation follows the pattern of tlk1/1b activity wherein it is inhibited immediately after dna damage and gets phosphorylated when tlk1/1b regains its activity  <cit> . the reason for this transient inactivation of tlk1/1b still remains a question as there is a lack of direct evidence for the role of this inhibitory phosphorylation with regards to its effect on rad <dig> and atr mediated cell signaling. in order to answer this question we have made an s457a mutant  of tlk1b that lacks the inhibitory phosphorylation site. in this study we show that mut tlk1b remains active in the presence of dna damage, and cells overexpressing it display an altered cell cycle checkpoint and delay in cell cycle progression upon recovery from hydroxyurea . mut tlk1b overexpressing cells show an increase in phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig>  in response to hu mediated replication arrest, mut tlk1b overexpressing cells show a massive reduction in the formation of rad <dig> foci and reduced association of rad <dig> with the chromatin. mut tlk1b expressing cells show reduced association of rad <dig> with hus <dig> and wrn suggesting an early dissociation of 9-1- <dig> complex. in response to hu, these cells show an increased accumulation of dsbs which are marked by an increase in association of p-atm  and γ-h2ax with the chromatin. cellular fractionation data of mut tlk1b overexpressing cells showed an increase in the accumulation of total rad <dig> and p-rad <dig>  in the cytoplasm. furthermore, studies with rad <dig> s328d phosphomimetic mutant suggest that the phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> alone is sufficient to prevent rad <dig> localization into the nucleus. our results indicate that in response to replication arrest, transient inhibition of tlk1/1b is crucial to maintain localization of rad <dig> into the nucleus at damage sites.

RESULTS
mut tlk1b increases phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> both in presence and absence of dna damage
we generated a s457a tlk1b mutant which lacks the chk <dig> inhibitory phosphorylation site and cloned it into the pires2-egfp vector. we then generated hek <dig> stable cell lines overexpressing mutant  and wild-type  tlk1b, after selection for high gfp positive cells . figure 1a confirms the overexpression of wt and mut tlk1b in hek <dig> cells. further, after treatment with doxorubicin  wt tlk1b shows an increase in phosphorylation at s <dig> whereas the phospho-specific antibody doesn’t recognize the overexpressed mut tlk1b . the mutant and empty vector  show a slight band of p-tlk1b s <dig> attributable to the endogenous tlk1b that is translationally induced after doxo treatment  <cit> . in comparison with the wt and ev, the basal level of rad <dig> phosphorylation is elevated in the mut tlk1b expressing cells . in the mut tlk1b expressing cells the phosphorylation of rad <dig> is not suppressed after dna damage, either with doxo  or hu , which suggests that the mut kinase is active even in the presence of dna damage. in wt cells, rad <dig> phosphorylation at s <dig> is initially very low and progressively increases by 6–8 h of recovery from hu . in mut tlk1b cells, the phosphorylation of rad <dig> is elevated after release from hu but decreases after 8 h of recovery, possibly due to the activation of a phosphatase. hu depletes the deoxyribonucleotide pools that results in replication fork stalling, leading to recruitment of rad <dig> fig.  <dig>

cells expressing mut tlk1b show defects in formation of rad <dig> foci
when cells are exposed to replication stress rad <dig> protein is redistributed to form discrete nuclear foci at the sites of dna damage  <cit> . the recruitment of the 9-1- <dig> complex at the sites of dna damage can be visualized by looking at the formation of rad <dig> foci  <cit> . we showed that in response to dna damage rad <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation persists in the cells overexpressing mut tlk1b. we wanted to examine whether tlk1b mutant cells show any defects in formation of rad <dig> foci. in order to look at the rad <dig> foci associated with chromatin, soluble proteins were removed before fixation . in comparison with the wt, cells expressing mut tlk1b showed a drastic reduction in the formation of rad <dig> foci. the wt cells had much brighter and greater number of rad <dig> foci  in comparison with the mut tlk1b expressing cells. when the soluble proteins were not removed before fixation we saw an increased accumulation of rad <dig> in the cytoplasm in the mut tlk1b expressing cells .fig.  <dig>

cells expressing mut tlk1b show reduction in association of rad <dig> with the chromatin
it has been shown that replication stress stimulates the association of rad <dig> with the chromatin  <cit> . we next wanted to see if this phosphorylation may result in early dissociation of rad <dig> from the chromatin in these cells. to study association and dissociation kinetics of rad <dig> in the cells expressing wt and mut tlk1b we performed chromatin fractionation assay after treating cells with hu and allowing them to recover. in the wt tlk1b expressing cells rad <dig> was largely associated with the chromatin fraction at recovery time t =  <dig> . rad <dig> was found in the chromatin bound fraction until 4 h of recovery period. however at around  <dig> to 8 h of recovery time the rad <dig> levels decreased in the chromatin bound fraction. a very different pattern was seen in the mut tlk1b expressing cells . these cells had very low levels of rad <dig> bound to the chromatin fraction until 4 h of recovery period . however after 6 h of recovery time the rad <dig> levels increased in the chromatin bound fraction. we believe that this is due the accumulation of dna damage  at this time, and that this may trigger a mechanism for the re-import of rad <dig> into the nucleus that is independent on s <dig> phosphorylation by tlk1b.fig.  <dig>

cells expressing mut tlk1b show an increased accumulation of rad <dig> and p-rad <dig> s <dig> in the cytoplasmic fraction
through fractionation we obtained cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear and chromatin bound proteins. correct distribution was confirmed by immunoblots using tubulin and orc <dig> antibodies . we expected that the phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> would cause the release of rad <dig> from chromatin fraction into the soluble fraction. when we analyzed the cytoplasmic fraction we saw a reciprocal distribution where the decrease of rad <dig> from the chromatin fraction  corresponded with its increase in the cytoplasmic fraction  and vice versa. it should be noted that rad <dig> in the cytoplasm appears as a single band, but gets phosphorylated on multiple residues once it gets loaded onto the chromatin, resulting in the appearance of multiple bands  <cit> . in the wt tlk1b expressing cells until 2–4 h of recovery time, low levels of rad <dig> were present in the cytoplasmic fraction as most of it was bound to the chromatin. however, around 6 h of recovery in these cells rad <dig> levels decreased in the chromatin bound fraction and correspondingly increased in the cytoplasmic fraction. in the mut tlk1b expressing cells, most of rad <dig> was found in the cytoplasm until 4 h of recovery; however, around 6–8 h of recovery time rad <dig> levels in the cytoplasm gradually decreased and correspondingly increased in the chromatin bound fraction. during replication stress mut tlk1b expressing cells had increased levels of p-rad <dig> s <dig>  in the cytoplasm. the pattern of rad <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic fraction exactly matched the pattern of total rad <dig>  suggesting that the phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> may be responsible for its accumulation in the cytoplasm. previously using an adeno-ho-mediated cleavage system in mm3mg cells, we had shown that overexpression of kinase dead tlk delays the release of rad <dig> and rad <dig> upon repair of the dsb  <cit> . in our previous study we identified specific tlk inhibitors that prevent the tlk-mediated phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> and cause defects in checkpoint recovery  <cit> . mut tlk1b overexpressing cells, showing an increased tlk1b activity, showed an early dissociation of the rad <dig> from the chromatin. we next wanted to examine if inhibition of tlks with specific inhibitor thioridazine hydrochloride  leads to an increase in association of rad <dig> with the chromatin. as expected, we saw an increased association of rad <dig> onto the chromatin in the presence of thd . also rad <dig> remained bound onto the chromatin for longer time in the presence of the thd .fig.  <dig>

phosphomimetic rad <dig> s328d mutant is sufficient to accumulate rad <dig> in the cytoplasm
we next wanted to examine if phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> is sufficient to alter the nuclear localization of rad <dig>  in order to do so we generated a phosphomimetic flag-tagged rad <dig> s328d mutant . fractionation was performed on the cells overexpressing the flag-tagged rad <dig> s328d mutant and flag-tagged wt rad <dig>  these cells were incubated with or without hu. after fractionating the cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear and chromatin bound proteins the distribution of rad <dig> was examined by immunoblotting with either anti-flag antibody to specifically detect overexpressed flag-tagged wt or mut rad <dig>  or anti-rad <dig> antibody to detect both the endogenous and overexpressed rad <dig> . immunoblotting with anti-flag antibody showed that the overexpressed rad <dig> s328d mutant was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm while the overexpressed wt rad <dig> was present in all the three fractions . these results confirm that the phosphorylation of rad <dig> at s <dig> is sufficient to accumulate rad <dig> in the cytoplasm. as previously mentioned multiple rad <dig> bands appear in the chromatin fraction due to phosphorylation of rad <dig> at multiple sites. cellular fractionation results were confirmed by immunolocalization , which showed that the flag-tagged rad <dig>  localized to the cytoplasm whereas the wt rad <dig> was nuclear .

phosphomimic rad9-t355d does not affect its nuclear/cytoplasmic localization
scott davey`s group has recently found rad <dig> t <dig> as another phosphorylation site of tlk <dig>  <cit> . interestingly t <dig> lies next to nuclear localization sequence , which starts at the residue  <dig> and ends at  <dig>  bioinformatics analysis with cnls mapper predicted that rad <dig> is localized exclusively in the nucleus, and t355d mutation in rad <dig> would cause a partial cytoplasmic accumulation. our cellular fractionation data of mut tlk1b overexpressing cells showed an increase in the accumulation of total p-rad <dig>  in the cytoplasm but it was unclear if this simply reflected the total rad <dig> level, i.e., phosphorylated also at s <dig> . we next wanted to examine if phosphorylation of rad <dig> at t <dig> can alter the nuclear localization of rad <dig>  in order to do so we generated a phosphomimetic flag-tagged t355d mutant. the rad <dig> t355d mutant was also found in the chromatin and nucleoplasmic fractions, although the chromatin to cytoplasmic ratio for the t355d mutant was not identical to the wt rad <dig> .

mut tlk1b expressing cells show reduced association of rad <dig> with hus <dig> and wrn
stable 9-1- <dig> complex is required for the recruitment of wrn at the stalled replication forks. replication stress stimulates the interaction of rad <dig> with hus <dig>  <cit>  and wrn  <cit> . inactivation resistant mut tlk1b accumulates rad <dig> in the cytoplasm which would affect recruitment of wrn at stalled replication forks. in order to examine the stability of the 9-1- <dig> complex and wrn recruitment we examined the interaction of rad <dig> with hus <dig> and wrn in the wt and mut tlk1b expressing cells. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-rad <dig> antibody and analyzed for the association with hus <dig> and wrn. in the untreated wt tlk1b expressing cells rad <dig> was associated with hus <dig>  and wrn  and this was stimulated upon treatment with hu. however, mut tlk1b expressing cells showed reduced association of rad <dig> with hus <dig>  and wrn , suggesting that the mut tlk1b reduces the stability of 9-1- <dig> and its interaction with wrn.fig.  <dig> 
a immunoprecipitation of rad <dig> in wt and mut tlk1b expressing cells. b hu treatment results in increased formation of 9-1- <dig> complex as indicated by the increased association of rad <dig> with hus <dig>  this interaction is greatly diminished in mut tlk1b expressing cells. c co-immunoprecipitation of wrn with rad <dig> is also is greatly diminished in mut tlk1b expressing cells. d immunoprecipitation of overexpressed flag tagged rad <dig> in wt and  mut rad <dig> expressing cells. e co-immunoprecipitation of hus <dig> with overexpressed flag-rad <dig> is diminished in rad <dig> s328d mut expressing cells. f co-immunoprecipitation of wrn with overexpressed flag-rad <dig> is diminished in rad <dig> s328d mut expressing cells



we next wanted to examine if the overexpressed rad <dig> s328d mutant  can interact with wrn and hus <dig> since this association should occur largely on chromatin. immunoprecipitation of the overexpressed rad <dig> s328d mutant using flag antibody showed that the interaction of mutant rad <dig> with wrn and hus <dig> was greatly impaired, while the overexpressed wt rad <dig> was able to bind normally . in this case, the addition of hu did not increase the association of wt rad <dig> with wrn and hus <dig> probably due to the overexpression of the protein.

mut tlk1b expressing cells show increased amount of dna damage
it has been shown that the interaction between wrn and the 9-1- <dig> complex prevent dsb formation at the stalled replication forks  <cit> . the fraction of wrn bound to chromatin  after treatment and release from hu is significantly reduced in the mut tlk1b expressing cells, particularly at recovery period of 0 h , when maximum number of fork are stalled. we next wanted to examine if the mut tlk1b expressing cells show an increase in dsbs. in response to dsbs, atm is autophosphorylated at s <dig>  this autophosphorylation stabilizes atm at the dsbs and is a marker of atm activation. prolonged treatment with hu generates dsbs. in the chromatin bound fraction of wt tlk1b expressing cells at the recovery period of 0 h we saw increased levels of p-atm s <dig> . however after 4 h of recovery there was a decrease in p-atm s <dig> suggesting that most of the dsbs have been repaired. in comparison, mut tlk1b expressing cells showed increased levels of p-atm  until 8 h of recovery time . activated atm phosphorylates h2ax at s <dig>  which is known as γ-h2ax. in the wt tlk1b expressing cells γ-h2ax was present only until 4 h of recovery period; however, the mut tlk1b expressing cells showed increased levels of γ-h2ax till 8 h of recovery time . these results suggest that in response to replication stress mut tlk1b expressing cells have an increase in dsbs that persist beyond 8 h of recovery.fig.  <dig>

activation of atm is essential for formation of γ-h2ax  <cit> . studies from several groups have shown that atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation can occur even in the absence of dsbs. . since we observed both activation and persistence of atm and γ-h2ax in mut tlk1b expressing cells, we probed for presence of dsbs in these cells by comet assays. we observed comets with large tail length and tail moment in the mut tlk1b expressing cells  after treatment and recovery from hu, whereas comets were not present at these times in control cells.fig.  <dig> comet assays was performed to measure the amount of unrepaired dna damage in untreated cells or cells treated with 2 mm hu and recovery for indicated time points. a representative images of the different time points. b tail moments  as quantified for each cell using imagej opencomet plugin.  <dig> comet images were measured for each treatment



hu treatment of mut tlk1b expressing cells show a delay in cell cycle progression and recovery
we wanted to study the effect of this damage resistant kinase on cell cycle progression and recovery from hu induced replication arrest. treatment with hu causes the cells to accumulate at the g1/s boundary. washing away the hu allows completion of s-phase and then synchronous entry into g2/m-phase, and then re-entry into the g1-phase of the next cycle. cells overexpressing wt tlk1b  when released from hu complete s-phase at around 8 h of recovery, synchronously enter into g2/m-phase at around 10 h and then re-enter into the g <dig> after 12 h. at around 14 h all the wt cells have recovered. in contrast, mut tlk1b overexpressing cells  remain arrested in the s-phase for 10 h. by 12 h only 7 % of mut tlk1b expressing cells re-enter back into the g1-phase, in comparison to 35 % of cells expressing wt tlk1b. by 14 h mut tlk1b expressing cells still remain in the s- and g2-phase in comparison with the cells expressing wt tlk1b which mostly re-enter into g- <dig> phase by that time. thus, in response to replication stress cells expressing inactivation resistant mut tlk1b arrest in the s- and g2-phase and show delay in re-entry into the cell cycle. we should stress that in the absence of hu the cell cycle profile is undistinguishable from wt tlk1b or parental cells . comet assays also showed no presence of dsbs in the absence of hu treatment.fig.  <dig> cell cycle distribution of the cells overexpressing. a wt tlk1b and b mut tlk1b during a time course after release from hu



mut tlk1b expressing cells display an altered checkpoint control
atr is the primary kinase that phosphorylates rpa <dig> at t <dig> after hu treatment  <cit> . phosphorylation of rpa by atr stimulates dna synthesis and prevents ssdna accumulation during replication stress  <cit> . since less rad <dig> was associated with the chromatin in the mut tlk1b expressing cells, we expected to see a reduced phosphorylation of the atr substrates in these cells. as expected, we observed a reduced phosphorylation of rpa <dig> t <dig> in the mut tlk1b expressing cells . however, we didn’t observe a reduction in chk <dig> phosphorylation . in mut tlk1b expressing cells we saw an increased accumulation of dsbs and atm activation. since we observed chk <dig> phosphorylation in the mut tlk1b expressing cells, we wanted to examine if this was mediated via atm. it has been shown that atm and atr pathways exhibit a high degree of crosstalk . atm has been shown to phosphorylate chk <dig> in vitro and increase in dsb accumulation has been shown to induce atm mediated phosphorylation of chk <dig>  <cit> . treatment with a specific atm inhibitor  showed a slight reduction in chk <dig> phosphorylation in the mut cell line , suggesting that the increased chk <dig> phosphorylation in these cells could be due to an increase in atm activity, as shown in fig.  <dig>  since we know that atr is inhibited in these cells due to the lack of chromatin bound rad <dig>  there is the possibility that part of the chk <dig> phosphorylation is instead due to the activity of dna-pkcs in mut tlk1b expressing cells —this needs to be investigated further.fig.  <dig> chk <dig> activation in wt and mut tlk1b expressing cells after treatment and recovery from hu a mut tlk1b expressing cells show reduced phosphorylation of rpa at t <dig>  during recovery from hu, phosphorylation of chk <dig> at s <dig> and s <dig> persists for 8 h in cells expressing mut tlk1b, in contrast to wt expressing cells. b treatment of cells with ku- <dig> leads to a reduction of chk <dig> phosphorylation in the mut tlk1b expressing cells



discussion
tousled like kinases  are serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in dna repair. tlk overexpression is observed in multiple cancers and often corresponds to reduced sensitivity towards radiotherapy or chemotherapy due to the efficient repair in those tumors  <cit> . our lab identified tlk1b, which is a splice variant of tlk <dig> gene from a library of mrnas that are translationally upregulated by overexpression of translation initiation factor 4e. tlk1b is known to protect cells from genotoxic stress and is translationally upregulated in response to stress and dna damage via mtor-eif4e pathway  <cit> . at the same time, genotoxic stress leads to chk <dig> mediated transient inactivation of tlk  <cit> . tlk1b promotes repair of damaged dna in cooperation with rad <dig> by facilitating the assembly of repair proteins to the sites of dna damage. tlks are the only kinases that phosphorylate rad <dig> at s <dig>  rad <dig> is aberrantly expressed in prostate, breast, thyroid, skin, lung, and gastric cancers  <cit> . it plays a major role in cell cycle checkpoint and dna damage repair. it is essential for genomic stability as frequent chromosomal breakage is observed in cells in which both the rad <dig> alleles are inactivated  <cit> . rad <dig>  a member of pcna-like 9-1- <dig> complex, contains  <dig> amino acid long c-terminal region that does not share homology with pcna. this c-terminal region of rad <dig> is extensively modified by phosphorylation. some residues are constitutively phosphorylated while some are transiently phosphorylated in response to dna damage and cell cycle position  <cit> . in response to dna damage, once tlk1b regains its kinase activity it transiently phosphorylates rad <dig> at s <dig>  in this study we wanted to elucidate the significance of this phosphorylation.

it has been shown that the stable 9-1- <dig> complex is required for wrn localization at the stalled replication forks  <cit> , and is necessary for the atr-dependent phosphorylation of wrn following replication fork stalling  <cit> . the possible role of the tlk1b mediated phosphorylation of rad <dig> on its interaction with wrn was not known. in this work we investigated the significance of the inhibition of tlk1b activity following replication stress and its consequence for rad <dig> phosphorylation in relation to the dna damage response  and checkpoint recovery. in previous studies using a kinase dead tlk1b we have found that the release of rad <dig> from a dsb induced with ho nuclease was delayed well beyond the time required to repair the break  <cit> . conversely, in this work we report that constitutive phosphorylation of rad <dig> by the mutant tlk1b after release from hu results in its dissociation from chromatin and translocation to the cytoplasm . consistent with this model, the rad <dig>  mutant was found exclusively in the cytoplasm and didn’t associate with the chromatin. we also studied the consequences of this effect of inactivation resistant tlk1b mutant on ddr and cell cycle checkpoint. we found that the cells delayed in cell cycle recovery following release from hu and remained in the s- and g <dig> phase for several more hours compared to the cell expressing wt tlk1b. our explanation for these results is that premature phosphorylation of rad <dig> mediated by the inactivation resistant tlk1b mutant leads to the dissociation of the 9-1- <dig> complex from sites of damage and stalled forks . this dissociation leads to fork collapse and generation of dsbs marked by increase in γh2ax and activated atm. atm activates chk <dig>  marked by its phosphorylation at s <dig> and s <dig>  which mediates cell cycle arrest. the premature dissociation of the 9-1- <dig> complex from stalled forks in mut tlk1b expressing cells results in lesser amount of rad <dig> associated with hus <dig> and wrn. in fact, there was less wrn in association with chromatin after release from hu in mut tlk1b expressing cells, which would be expected to result in increased fork collapse, as wrn promotes replication fork recovery  <cit> . thus, in this study we have identified the significance of rad <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation and have shown that the presence of the damage resistant active tlk1b targets rad <dig> to the cytoplasm. we should emphasize that loss of rad <dig> from the nucleus can increase the instances of chromosomal breakage leading to genomic instability. scott davey’s group reported that tlk <dig> phosphorylates primarily rad <dig> and that plays a key role in cell cycle progression and g2/m checkpoint exit  <cit> . in our mut tlk1b overexpressing cells, the phosphorylation of rad <dig>  was very weak, but more importantly, we could not see a difference in cytoplasmic/nuclear redistribution when a t355d mutant was used. the accumulation of rad <dig> in the cytoplasm is consistent only with the s <dig> phosphorylation data and the s328d substitution, whereas the t335d phosphomimetic mutation was not sufficient to accumulate rad <dig> in the cytoplasm.fig.  <dig> model for the tlk1b mediated phosphorylation of rad <dig> leading to dissociation of 9-1- <dig> from damage sites and redistribution of rad <dig> to the cytoplasm



CONCLUSIONS
our collective work has demonstrated that tlk1b acts as a chaperone for rad <dig>  in the absence of tlk <dig> kinase activity, i.e., in presence of dna damage or when a kinase-dead protein is used, we showed that tlk1b promoted the association of rad <dig> with a dsb and presumably also ssb. once the damage is repaired, the kinase activity recovers and then tlk1b phosphorylates rad <dig> at s <dig>  promoting its dissociation from 9-1- <dig> and export to the cytoplasm, thereby mediating the deactivation of the ddr. in conclusion transient inhibition of the kinase after dna damage is crucial in retaining 9-1- <dig> at damage sites until repair is complete, and mutations in the tlk <dig> gene which can activate the kinase may potentially cause accumulation of dsbs.
