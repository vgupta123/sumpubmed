BACKGROUND
the lat gene encodes a 36– <dig> kd transmembrane protein that connects various cell surface receptors to downstream signaling events. following receptor engagement, lat becomes heavily tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently binds a number of proteins containing sh <dig> domains, including members of the grb <dig> family  and phospholipase c-γ   <cit> . the interaction of grb <dig>  plc-γ and other proteins with lat facilitates their activation and leads to additional biochemical events required for a productive cellular response, including activation of the ras-mapk signaling pathway and an elevation in intracellular calcium levels  <cit> .

one receptor type whose engagement results in lat tyrosine phosphorylation is the t cell receptor   <cit> . the essential role of lat in tcr signaling has been revealed through the study of mutant jurkat t cell lines that fail to express the lat gene  <cit> . these lat-deficient t cells display a number of signaling defects that prevent t cell activation and effector cell function. an analysis of lat-deficient mice has also shown that the lat protein is necessary for t cell maturation within the thymus  <cit> . in addition to its requirement for t cell development and function, lat has important roles in other cell-types. for example, lat is required for mast cell activation following engagement of the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin e, for natural killer  cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and for collagen, collagen-related peptide, and convulxin-mediated activation of platelets  <cit> . moreover, engagement of the pre-b cell receptor on developing b cells induces lat tyrosine phosphorylation, an event that may contribute to b cell differentiation  <cit> .

the identified role of lat in these cell-types is reflective of its expression pattern. lat rna and/or protein has been detected in the thymus, spleen, and peripheral blood cells but is absent in the colon, brain, small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, kidney, skeletal muscle, and liver  <cit> . examination of specific cell-types indicates that lat gene expression is restricted to a subset of cell-types generated during hematopoiesis, namely t cells, mast cells, platelets, and nk cells  <cit> . lat is also expressed at low levels during the early stages of b cell development and is subsequently down-regulated prior to b cell maturation  <cit> .

to date, the means by which the lat gene is transcriptionally regulated has not been investigated. in the present work, we have mapped the transcriptional start sites for the human lat gene and localized the proximal promoter region to approximately  <dig> bp extending upstream of the translation start site. within the promoter, we have identified a negative regulatory region and two ets binding sites that are bound by the elf- <dig> transcription factor. mutation of these ets sites significantly reduces promoter activity, and consistent with these findings, overexpression of elf- <dig> potently enhances lat promoter function. a runx binding site is also identified that binds runx- <dig>  and which when mutated results in an increase in lat promoter activity. the data presented also suggests that the identified promoter region may mediate cell-type specific expression of the lat gene. collectively, these results provide the first insights into the transcriptional regulation of the lat gene, which encodes an essential adaptor protein linking cell-surface receptors to critical downstream signaling events.

RESULTS
the lat gene contains multiple transcription start sites
as an initial step in the identification and characterization of the lat promoter, we mapped the transcription start site for the human lat gene using rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends  and poly rna isolated from jurkat t cells or human thymus. the products of rlm-race, which are only derived from rna transcripts extending to the terminal 5' cap structure  <cit> , were ligated into the pbluescript® vector and  <dig> of the resulting clones from each source of rna were sequenced. the results indicate that the lat gene possesses multiple transcription start sites that lie in a region spanning roughly  <dig> bp and located between  <dig> to  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start site . the transcription start sites mapped to the same general region in jurkat t cells and human thymus, and in many cases the same sites were utilized. analysis of the dna sequence surrounding the transcription start sites revealed that the region is g/c-rich but lacks consensus sites for either a tata box or initiator elements. similar to this situation, it has been observed that other g/c-rich promoters which lack a tata box or initiator elements also possess multiple transcription start sites that span regions of  <dig> bp or more  <cit> .

the lat promoter extends  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start site
to ascertain whether regions 5' and 3' of the transcription start sites possess promoter activity, a dna fragment extending  <dig> bp upstream from the translation start site was amplified by pcr and inserted adjacent to the firefly luciferase gene in the pgl3-basic vector. of note, in this study the 'a' nucleotide of the translation start site atg codon has been designated + <dig>  thus, the transcription start sites lie in the region from - <dig> to - <dig> and the  <dig> bp fragment extends from - <dig> to - <dig>  transient transfection into jurkat t cells with the luciferase reporter construct containing the - <dig> to - <dig> dna fragment resulted in a greater than 10-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to the empty, promoterless pgl3-basic vector, demonstrating that this dna fragment contains significant promoter activity . in order to more precisely map the boundaries of the promoter, sequential 5' and 3' deletions of  <dig> bp were introduced and the effect on promoter activity was determined in jurkat cells. deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> did not have an appreciable effect on promoter activity. however, deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in a decrease in promoter activity, and a further decrease was observed when the region from - <dig> to - <dig> was removed. finally, when the - <dig> to - <dig> region was deleted, promoter activity dropped to background levels .

surprisingly, when the 3'  <dig> bp was removed from the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter fragment , a substantial increase in promoter activity occurred . however, removal of an additional  <dig> bp from the 3' end  completely abrogated promoter activity . this latter result is most likely a consequence of eliminating all the transcription start sites . in summary, these results indicate that the proximal promoter for the lat gene lies in a region extending from - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the translation start site, with the region from - <dig> to - <dig> having an overall stimulatory effect on promoter activity while the region from - <dig> to - <dig> has an inhibitory effect.

in this initial study of the lat promoter, we chose to focus on the region spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> since it contained a significant portion of promoter activity . to more precisely map the positive regulatory elements within this region, a series of sequential  <dig> bp deletions from the 5' end of the - <dig> to - <dig> fragment were created and the resultant promoter activity of each dna fragment was determined in jurkat t cells. as shown in fig. 2c, deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> did not result in a significant loss in promoter function. in contrast, deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> reduced promoter activity to background levels . these results indicate that the region spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> contains a substantial portion of the positive regulatory elements mediating transcription of the human lat gene. consistent with these data, a dna fragment spanning from - <dig> to - <dig>  which contains the - <dig> to - <dig> stimulatory region and a number of transcription start sites found between - <dig> to - <dig>  displayed robust promoter activity .

linker scanning mutagenesis of the - <dig> to - <dig> region within the lat promoter
linker scanning mutagenesis throughout the - <dig> to - <dig> region, conducted by introducing sequential  <dig> bp mutations containing a noti restriction site sequence, was performed with the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter fragment and the effects on promoter activity were tested in jurkat t cells . each  <dig> bp mutation resulted in a decrease in promoter activity, with the most dramatic reduction occurring when the region from - <dig> to - <dig> was altered .

to ensure that the effects observed in the linker scanning mutagenesis experiments were not an artifact of the introduced sequence, we also constructed an additional set of linker scanning mutations throughout the - <dig> to - <dig> region, sequentially mutating the same  <dig> bp segments except introducing a sequence containing the nhei restriction site. transient transfection of these reporter constructs in jurkat t cells yielded results similar to those obtained in fig. 3b except for the region spanning from - <dig> to - <dig>  which when mutated in this latter set of experiments yielded only a ~50% decrease in promoter function .

collectively, the data from linker scanning mutagenesis indicates that the entire region from - <dig> to - <dig> is required for optimal lat promoter activity in jurkat t cells, with dna sequences from - <dig> to - <dig> having the most prominent role.

two ets sites are required for lat promoter activity
analysis of the - <dig> to - <dig> region using a variety of transcription factor binding site databases, including transfac®, jaspar, and matinspector  <cit> , revealed a number of possible regulatory elements, including two sites that contain the core binding sequence  for the ets family of transcription factors   <cit> . these potential ets sites, which lie within the critical - <dig> to - <dig> region, were of particular interest in light of the well-documented role ets transcription factors play in the development and function of t cells and other cell types that express the lat gene  <cit> .

to determine the function of each putative ets site in the regulation of the lat promoter, point mutations were introduced into each of these sites  in the context of the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter fragment and the effect of each mutation was determined in jurkat t cells. when either ets site was mutated, a significant decrease in promoter activity was observed . furthermore, simultaneous deletion of both ets sites resulted in a level of promoter activity less than when either site alone was mutated. these data demonstrate that both putative ets sites have a strong, positive effect on lat promoter function in t cells.

both ets sites bind elf- <dig>  a member of the ets transcription factor family
electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were used to identify protein complexes that specifically bind each of the putative ets sites. 32p labeled dna probes encompassing each ets site were incubated with nuclear extracts from jurkat t cells and then analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. two major complexes were detected binding to the ets site centered at - <dig> . one of these complexes was competed for with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type probe  but was not competed for when the ets site was mutated , demonstrating that this complex specifically interacted with the ets site. of note, the mutant probe used in these competition experiments contained the same bp changes as those introduced into the ets site in the promoter construct used in transient transfections.

additional competition experiments were performed with an unlabeled probe containing a consensus ets site  or the same probe except that the ets site was disrupted by a point mutation  . the loss of binding in the presence of the consensus wild-type ets sequence but not with the mutated sequence suggested that the specific complex contains members of the ets family of transcription factors. in an effort to identify the particular ets family members capable of binding the - <dig> ets site, we performed antibody supershift experiments. the human genome contains  <dig> genes that encode members of the ets family of transcription factors,  <dig> of which have been shown to be expressed in jurkat cells  <cit> . we chose to focus on ets- <dig>  ets- <dig>  elf- <dig>  and fli- <dig>  ets family members implicated in the regulation of gene expression in t cells and other cell types that express the lat gene  <cit> . although addition of antibodies to ets- <dig> or fli- <dig> had no discernible effect, in the presence of the elf- <dig> antibody a significant decrease in the intensity of the specific complex was observed, and upon longer exposure of the gel, supershifted complexes were detected . it was also evident upon addition of the elf- <dig> antibody that the specific complex contains at least two distinguishable bands, one of which appears unaffected by the elf- <dig> antibody . finally, in the presence of the ets- <dig> antibody, a novel slower mobility band appeared. although the appearance of this band was not accompanied by an appreciable decrease in the intensity of the specific complex, it is known that antibodies to ets- <dig> can enhance its dna binding capability, and thus we can not presently exclude the possibility that ets- <dig> may also bind to this site in the lat promoter. in summary, these results indicate that the - <dig> ets site in the lat promoter is capable of binding the ets transcription factor elf- <dig>  and also possibly ets- <dig> 

when the ets site centered at - <dig> was examined by emsa, three complexes were detected . two of these complexes were competed for with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type probe, but not when the ets site was mutated, demonstrating that the binding of these complexes required an intact ets site. when the consensus ets site was used in competition experiments, the more prominent specific complex was competed for while the less prominent one was unaffected , suggesting that the more prominent complex contains ets family members. the composition of the less prominent complex is uncertain at this time but may contain a transcription factor that binds to a site that overlaps the ets site. in supershift experiments, addition of antibodies to ets- <dig>  ets- <dig>  and fli- <dig> had no appreciable effect on the specific complexes, but when the elf- <dig> antibody was added to the binding reaction an almost complete loss of the most prominent complex was observed, and this was accompanied by the appearance of slower mobility, supershifted bands . these data demonstrate that elf- <dig> is capable of binding both ets sites in the lat promoter.

activation of the lat promoter by overexpression of elf-1
to further explore the potential role of elf- <dig> in the regulation of lat gene expression, overexpression studies were conducted. preliminary experiments were performed in jurkat t cells and failed to reveal an effect of elf- <dig> overexpression on lat promoter activity , a result likely attributable to the high endogenous levels of this transcription factor in these cells  <cit> . we therefore used hela cells for these experiments, which in contrast to jurkat t cells express low to undetectable levels of the elf- <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of elf- <dig> in hela cells resulted in a greater than 10-fold increase in lat promoter activity . of note, identical results were obtained when either the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter fragment  or the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter fragment  were used. to determine whether the observed activation by elf- <dig> occurred through the ets sites centered at - <dig> and - <dig>  elf- <dig> was overexpressed in the presence of the promoter construct containing point mutations in both these sites. mutation of the ets sites resulted in dramatic decrease in the ability of elf- <dig> to stimulate promoter function , results that clearly demonstrate elf- <dig> can stimulate gene expression through both of the ets sites in the lat promoter.

role of the lat promoter in cell-type specific expression
the lat gene is expressed in t cells, nk cells, mast cells, platelets, and developing b cells but not in other cells types  <cit>  to explore the potential role of the lat promoter in mediating cell-type specific gene expression, we investigated promoter activity in various cell-types that either do or do not express the endogenous lat gene. in addition to jurkat t cells, the rbl-2h <dig> mast cell line has been shown to express the endogenous lat gene while the hela epithelial cell line, the 70z pre-b cell line, and the raji mature b cell line do not  <cit> . reporter vectors containing lat promoter fragments of various lengths were transfected into each of these cell-types and following incubation the cells were harvested and promoter activity quantitated.

in addition to jurkat cells, the - <dig> to - <dig> lat promoter fragment displayed significant activity in rbl-2h <dig> and hela cells but was relatively inactive in the 70z and raji b cell lines . experiments were also conducted in each cell line using the pgl3-control vector which contains the sv <dig> promoter and enhancer. the average fold activation for the pgl3-control vector was  <dig>  for 70z,  <dig>  for raji,  <dig>  for rbl-2h <dig>  and  <dig>  for hela, indicating that the lack of appreciable lat promoter function in 70z and raji cell lines is not a consequence of low transfection efficiencies. these data suggest that the lack of promoter activity in 70z and raji cells may explain why the endogenous lat gene is not expressed in these cell-types. however, additional means of inhibiting lat gene expression likely exist since the promoter retained activity hela cells, another cell-type that fails to express the endogenous lat gene.

in contrast to results obtained in jurkat t cells, a promoter fragment spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> was unable to support gene expression in rbl-2h <dig> cells . this result implies that this region of the promoter may operate differently in these two cells-types, and it was conceivable that the ets sites located at - <dig> and - <dig> do not contribute to lat promoter activity in mast cells. in order to determine the role of the ets sites in mast cells, we tested the activity of the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter fragment in the absence or presence of mutations in each site. our results found that mutation of either ets site caused a reduction in promoter activity, and a further decrease was seen when both ets sites were mutated . thus, the ets sites centered at - <dig> and - <dig> are required for lat promoter function in both jurkat t cells and rbl-2h <dig> mast cells.

we also explored whether the inhibitory region spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> may be more active in mast cells since this could also explain why the - <dig> to - <dig> region was unable to support gene expression in rbl-2h <dig> cells. when the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter construct was transfected into rbl-2h <dig> cells, promoter activity increased over 6-fold relative to the - <dig> to - <dig> construct . when similar experiments were conducted in jurkat cells, an approximately 3-fold increase was observed . thus, the greater suppressive effect of the - <dig> to - <dig> region on lat promoter activity in rbl-2h <dig> cells may provide one explanation why the - <dig> to - <dig> region lacks activity in this cell line.

the lat promoter contains a potential runx binding site adjacent to the ets site centered at -360
alignment of the human lat promoter sequence with the region upstream of the translation start site for the mouse lat gene revealed that the ets sites are 100% conserved between the two species. interestingly, sequences adjacent to the ets sites are also conserved, and close inspection of the region 5' of the ets site centered at - <dig> revealed a potential binding site for the runx family of transcription factors. the runx family, also called cbfα, aml, or pebp <dig>  consists of three members: runx- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  <cit> . these transcription factors contain a conserved  <dig> amino acid dna binding domain that interacts with the consensus sequence 5'-accpuca-3', and they can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the context of the specific promoter or enhancer  <cit> . interestingly, in a number of instances runx and ets binding sites have been found adjacent to one another in gene regulatory regions. moreover, it has been shown that one runx family member, runx- <dig>  can physically interact with certain ets proteins, resulting in cooperative dna binding and thereby facilitating the activation of gene expression  <cit> . it was therefore conceivable that in a manner similar to other regulatory regions, runx- <dig> and ets proteins cooperatively interact at the lat promoter to activate gene expression.

as a first step in testing this possibility, emsa was used to determine if runx- <dig> could bind to the putative runx site in the lat promoter. in these experiments a 32p labeled probe encompassing both the runx site and the adjacent ets site at - <dig> was used, in contrast to results shown in fig.  <dig> in which case the 32p labelled probe contained the ets site but not the runx site. in the presence of jurkat nuclear extracts, a complex formed that contained a diffuse band that extended above and below a more defined central band . both the diffuse and central band were effectively competed for by an excess of unlabeled wild-type probe. when the unlabeled competitor contained a mutation in the ets site, the diffuse band was competed for but the more defined central band was not. conversely, when the unlabeled competitor contained a mutation in the runx site, the central band was competed for but not the more diffuse band. . finally, when the unlabeled competitor contained a mutation in both the runx and ets sites, no bands were competed. taken together, these results demonstrate that the diffuse band represents proteins specifically interacting with the runx site while the more defined central band represents proteins specifically binding to the ets site. of note, the prominent central band that remained in the presence of the competitor containing a mutation in the ets site could be supershifted with an antibody to elf- <dig> , which is consistent with our earlier data identifying elf- <dig> as the major ets family member binding to this site.

to determine whether the diffuse band may contain runx- <dig>  the member of the runx family shown to cooperate with ets proteins, we performed supershift assays. the addition of the runx- <dig> antibody to the binding reaction caused a loss of the diffuse band and the appearance of a supershifted complex . thus, the identified runx site in the lat promoter is capable of binding runx- <dig>  to investigate the role of the runx site in lat promoter function, we introduced a point mutation within the putative runx site in the context of the - <dig> to - <dig> promoter construct and tested its activity in both jurkat and rbl-2h <dig> cells. in contrast to our expectations, mutation of the runx site resulted in an increase in lat promoter function in both jurkat and rbl-2h <dig> cells , implying that this site has an inhibitory effect on lat promoter function.

discussion
this is the first study to examine the mechanisms regulating transcription of the human lat gene. the data presented indicates that the gene contains numerous transcription start sites and that the proximal promoter extends approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the translation start site. within the promoter we identified two ets sites which when mutated dramatically reduced transcriptional activity. both ets sites were shown to bind elf- <dig>  and consistent with this finding, promoter activity was significantly augmented following elf- <dig> overexpression. we also identified a binding site for runx- <dig> that appears to suppress promoter activity. finally, the absence of appreciable lat promoter activity in 70z and raji b cell lines may contribute to the cell-type specific expression of this gene.

our results demonstrate that deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> leads to a 3-fold or greater increase in lat promoter activity. since this region lies downstream of the transcription start sites, the effects observed could conceivably be mediated at the level of transcription or a subsequent step in the gene expression process, such as mrna stability or the efficiency of translation. however, this region still possesses inhibitory activity when moved upstream of the transcription start sites in the lat promoter , suggesting that the effect occurs at the level of transcription. although the biological relevance of the inhibitory region is presently unknown, the fact that the magnitude of its activity varies between jurkat and rbl-2h <dig> cells suggests that it may modulate cell type specific expression levels for the lat gene.

deletion analysis and linker scanning mutagenesis revealed that the region from - <dig> to - <dig> was particularly important for lat promoter function. within this region we identified two ets sites and demonstrated that these sites bind the ets transcription factor elf- <dig>  the finding that the lat gene is regulated by elf- <dig> is consistent with the known functions of elf- <dig> and other members of this transcription factor family. ets proteins have been shown to play a critical role in the development and function of t cells as well as other cell types of the immune system  <cit> , and elf- <dig> has been implicated in the regulation of a number of genes expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, including genes for the tcrζ chain, the cd <dig> co-receptor, the immunoglobulin heavy chain, the cytokine il- <dig>  and cd1d <dig> molecule  <cit> . the fact that both ets sites are 100% conserved in human, mouse, and rat  also suggests that these sites play a fundamental role in the regulation of lat gene expression.

adjacent to the ets site centered at - <dig> we identified a runx site that is capable of binding runx- <dig>  like the ets sites, this runx site is 100% conserved in human, mouse, and rat . similar to ets, runx family members have been shown to be critical for hematopoiesis and the expression of hematopoietic genes, where they positively or negatively regulate gene expression depending on the context of their binding site and/or prevailing intracellular conditions  <cit> . for example, during t cell development and/or in mature t cells, runx family members positively regulate expression of the interleukin- <dig>  granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and tcr α and β genes  <cit>  while they inhibit expression of the cd <dig> gene  <cit> .

a number of genes contain promoter or enhancer elements with adjacent ets and runx binding sites, including the tcr α and β enhancers, the osteopontin promoter, the immunoglobulin μ heavy chain enhancer, and the enhancers of the polyomavirus and the moloney leukemia virus  <cit> . both runx and ets proteins contain intramolecular inhibitory domains that can impede dna binding and studies have shown that runx- <dig> and certain members of the ets family, namely ets- <dig>  mef, and nerf  <cit> , can interact with each other, displacing the inhibitory domains and thereby stimulating dna binding and transactivation. elf- <dig> has also been shown, at least in vitro, to be capable of interacting with runx- <dig>  <cit> . based on these findings, and the close proximity of the ets and runx sites within the lat promoter, we hypothesized that the runx site would behave similarly to the ets site and contribute to the activation of lat gene expression. however, our results revealed that the runx site actually has a repressive effect on lat promoter activity, a result analogous to the inhibitory role of runx sites in the cd <dig> gene silencer region  <cit> . it is possible that runx- <dig> does not interact with elf- <dig> at the lat promoter and thus no cooperative effects would be expected. consistent with this possibility, our emsa data demonstrate that elf- <dig> and runx- <dig> can independently bind their respective sites in the lat promoter . runx proteins also interact with a number of other proteins that influence whether they have a positive or negative effect on gene expression  <cit> . thus, runx- <dig> may recruit to the lat promoter proteins that actively inhibit gene expression. it is also possible that under different circumstances, for example during hematopoiesis or in other cell-types, members of the runx and ets families cooperatively bind to the adjacent sites in the lat promoter to facilitate gene expression.

our data from the analysis of lat promoter activity in various cell-types is intriguing. the lack of significant lat promoter activity in 70z and raji b cells, which do not express the endogenous lat gene, suggests that the promoter region identified in this study may mediate cell-type specific expression of this gene. however, other mechanisms are likely to be involved in cell-type specific expression since the lat promoter retains substantial activity in hela cells, another cell line that fails to express the endogenous gene  <cit> . in this latter situation, it is conceivable that chromatin structure may play a more predominate role in cell-type specific regulation. it should also be noted that since elf- <dig> is expressed in b cells and has been shown to activate gene expression in b cells  <cit> , it is unlikely that this transcription factor alone plays a central role cell-type specific expression of lat.

the results analyzing lat promoter function in jurkat and rbl-2h <dig> cell lines, both of which express the endogenous lat gene  <cit> , indicates that functional differences exist. in particular, a promoter fragment spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> fails to support gene expression in the rbl-2h <dig> mast cell line. one possible explanation of this result is that the ets sites do not exert a positive effect on gene expression in mast cells. however, our data indicates that this is not the case and instead points to another explanation, namely that the - <dig> to - <dig> region and the runx sites have a greater suppressive effect in mast cells, and thereby may mitigate any positive contribution made by factors binding to the ets sites. the results in rbl-2h <dig>  jurkat, and hela cells also indicate that additional regulatory elements exist in the region upstream of - <dig>  and in particular in the region spanning from - <dig> to - <dig>  we have identified a number of potential sp- <dig> binding sites within this section of the promoter and are currently exploring the role these sites may play in lat gene regulation . this and additional research will further elucidate the role of various transcription factors in the regulation of lat gene expression, and should provide further insights into the role each of these factors play in the cell-type specific expression of this gene.

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms regulating transcription of the lat gene, which is expressed in a number cell-types generated during hematopoiesis. we have defined the proximal promoter region and found binding sites for two families of transcription factors, runx and ets, which are known to play important roles in the development and function of hematopoietic cells. these sites are capable of binding runx- <dig> and elf- <dig> and appear to have opposing effects on lat promoter function. these results provide initial insights into the regulation of the lat gene and provide a framework for further research.
