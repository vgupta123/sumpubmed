BACKGROUND
several genome centres have established very effective "pipelines" for the sequencing of entire genomes, often using a mixed strategy drawing data from mapped clones and whole genome shotgun efforts  <cit> . however, such pipelines are rapidly evolving through the incorporation of new, high-throughput sequencing platforms, that obviate conventional clone libraries, or sanger sequencing chemistries  <cit> , but yield sequence reads of limited length. as such, current and emerging sequencing strategies benefit from the availability of compatible physical maps guiding clone selection, or facilitating assemblies that may also enhance validation efforts  <cit> . furthermore, physical maps become a critical necessity when spanning repeat-rich genomic regions, typified by telomeric or centromeric portions of chromosomes. although clone fingerprint  <cit>  or end-sequence maps  <cit>  are widely used in whole-genome squencing efforts, gaps and sequence assembly errors may persist stemming from "clone drop-outs," or uncertainties in the map assembly process caused by the presence of repeated sequence elements. clearly, physical maps will continue to be an important feature of large-scale sequencing projects, but new mapping approaches must advance in ways that effectively deal with the trend towards obviation of traditional libraries and the abundance of modestly sized reads. the main issues will likely center on the validation of "strategically" unfinished genome sequences and comprehensive description of genome structure. these issues become acute when sequenced genomes are selected from nascently described organisms lacking genetic resources or an associated scientific community. consequently, future comparative studies could suffer from sequencing errors, and not fully discern structural variation – a major feature of genome evolution and a source of disease genotypes.

the rice  genome was originally chosen for sequencing because it is a staple food crop for more than half of the world's population, in addition to its many genetic attributes, or resources that include: a compact genome , well-defined genetic maps, yeast artificial chromosome  and bacterial artificial chromosome /p1-derived artificial chromosome  map resources, comprehensive sequence-tagged or transcript maps, and efficient genetic transformation techniques  <cit> . rice also shares extensive syntenic relationships with other cereal plants bearing huge genome sizes such as maize , barley , and wheat   <cit> . the large-scale sequencing of rice  was initiated in  <dig> under the auspices of the international rice genome sequencing project , with joint efforts from japan, the united sates, china, brazil, great britain, france, india, korea, and thailand  <cit> . irgsp members decided at the time to pursue the collaboration-friendly, clone-by-clone, or bac/pac-by-bac/pac strategy supported by extensive map resources. for example, bac/pac draft sequences or contigs were anchored and oriented on the rice genetic maps – these contigs were further augmented by bac-end sequencing  and contig-end walking. bac maps and fibre fluorescent in situ hybridization  were also used for characterization of gaps present within low recombination regions or genomic portions showing modest bac/pac coverage  <cit> . the irgsp release of the rice genome is now finished with publication of the analysis and annotation of these data  <cit> . here, the irgsp sequence for each chromosome – build  <dig> , released in august,  <dig> – is represented as a "pseudomolecule," or a virtual contig. each pseudomolecule is constructed by joining pac/bac sequences according to their order determined by comparison with a previously constructed physical map  <cit> . finishing steps include identification and removal of overlapping sequences with resulting physical gaps replaced by a variable number of successive "n's", reflecting their estimated breadth. there are  <dig> physical gaps including  <dig> telomeric gaps, and  <dig> centromeric gaps with a total size of ~ <dig>  mb  <cit> , with one gap closed in chromosome  <dig> and some of them partially filled  <cit>  within the current build.

in a parallel effort, tigr  also constructed similar pseudomolecules for each of  <dig> rice chromosomes  <cit>  to enlarge the span of regions comprising blocks of contiguous sequence – their approach included: the resolution of discrepancies between overlapping bac/pac clones, trimming of overlap regions, and linking of unique sequences. these efforts relied on  <dig>  rice bac/pac clone sequences obtained from the irgsp; of these,  <dig>  bac/pac clones  were finished, and  <dig> bac/pac  clones were unfinished , as defined by genbank. as such, the data show many gaps between clones, i.e., physical gaps, denoted by "1000n's" in the final pseudomolecules. finally, centromeres were identified using the "cento" centromeric sequence  <cit> . there are  <dig> physical gaps within the  <dig> pseudomolecules including gaps at  <dig> centromeres.

in addition to the rice genome sequence from the irgsp and tigr, the draft rice genome sequence of the same cultivar nipponbare was generated by two separate private sources: pharmacia, inc.  and syngenta, inc.   <cit> . a  <dig> mb draft sequence from pharmacia was also generated by a clone-by-clone based strategy  <cit> , while the  <dig> mb syngenta rice genome draft sequence consisting of  <dig>  sequence contigs was obtained using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach with an estimation of  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes for this cultivar. a draft sequence  of the o. sativa l. ssp. indica cultivar  was also obtained by the beijing genomics institute   <cit>  using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach with an estimated gene count of  <dig>  to  <dig>  for this subspecies. using tigr's pseudomolecules and publicly available rice est sequence data, affymetrix has recently constructed a rice gene expression array with  <dig>  rice gene models . in this regard, amongst sequenced genomes rice comprises the largest number of predicted genes, with more genes than human, and almost double that of arabidopsis thaliana.

although the current releases of rice sequence from irgsp, and tigr are of very high quality, difficult gaps remain to be spanned for each of the  <dig> chromosomal pseudomolecules. these gaps persist because some reside within genomic regions showing sparse coverage of genetic markers used for anchoring bac/pac clones, and others suffer from library construction, which may bias against heavily repetitive regions. importantly, existing gaps probably contain many functional genes  <cit> , even within centromeric regions  <cit> , in addition to information describing chromosomal structure. furthermore, sequence contigs, within the pseudomeolecules, may still contain errors, in part, arising from assemblies conducted in repeat-rich regions of the rice genome. given these issues, we constructed a genome wide optical map for determination of the size of sequence gaps and for identification of problematic sequence assemblies  through the analysis of sequence build alignments against our optical restriction map.

optical mapping is now a robust, automated system for the construction of whole genome ordered restriction maps from ensembles of individual genomic dna molecules  <cit> . library construction, pcr amplification, hybridization, and their attending artefacts are obviated in optical mapping, since genomic dna is the analyte and restriction enzymes are used to generate reliable markers. therefore, high-resolution physical maps are created on a whole genome basis presenting an organism's genetic constitution in a form directly linkable to sequence data. using a newly automated version of optical mapping system, we have constructed a whole genome physical map for the rice genome using the optical mapping system, employing schemes akin to whole genome shotgun sequencing approaches. given the results presented here, we find that there is no practical limit to the optical mapping of large, complex genomes, even in the absence of any sequence information, since the level of automation we have achieved provides ample data sets for our assembly techniques to span entire genomes. however, accessible sequence data for any genome provides direct links to a multitude of annotation and analysis tools that are especially facilitated when genomes are chosen to be strategically sequenced, such as maize.

more specifically, we present the construction of a whole-genome shotgun optical restriction map, using swai, of the rice  genome, and its comparison to sequence builds. because physical distances  between restriction sites are accurately determined by optical mapping, alignments of an "in silico" restriction map, constructed from sequence data, against our optical map reveal discordances characterized by features commonly associated with ordered restriction maps. they include: missing or extra restriction "cuts," missing or extra restriction fragments, and significant alterations of restriction fragment sizes or patterns. also, large-scale discordances covering hundreds of kilobases are discoverable and described here.

as such, we show that a high-resolution physical map based on the direct analysis of genomic dna, spans existing sequence physical gaps, validates the genome sequence assembly, characterizes gaps, corrects sequence misassemblies, and creates a physical scaffold for sequence finishing. we expect that this map will also secure a resource for the genome sequencing communities at-large in their investigation of rice subspecies and cultivars. we also think that the maps presented here will facilitate the final validation of the rice sequence data, which should strengthen the important role that this genome is already playing as an accessible model system for other plants and cereal crops.

RESULTS
data acquisition and map assembly
the whole-genome shotgun optical mapping approach  <cit>  was used for the construction of swai restriction maps covering about 97% of the ~ <dig> mb rice genome. a total of  <dig>  dna molecules, ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb, were individually mapped , representing  <dig>  mb in mass, or about  <dig> x coverage of the rice genome. the average size of molecules in this raw data set is  <dig>  kb with an average restriction fragment size of  <dig>  kb. although this value is significantly larger than the average restriction fragment size calculated from sequence data , our assembly scheme  segregates well-digested molecules for their inclusion into the final map contig assemblies. in total, there are  <dig>  single dna molecule maps  composing the finished contigs, making the rate of contig formation  <dig> %.

because the rice genome is significantly larger than previous genomes we have optically mapped, and assembly of optical maps is computationally demanding, we designed our assembly scheme  to effectively leverage cluster computing resources for handling very large single molecule data sets. in this way, map assembly software utilizes advantages offered by cluster computing techniques  <cit>   for full de novo map assembly. although, we could more easily use available sequence as a scaffold for facilitating map assembly, we reasoned that a purely de novo map assembly approach would obviate any concerns, regarding potential bias from nascent map alignments guided by sequence data. as such, our scheme embodies two major stages:

1) generation of "seed" or consensus maps
here, we divide the entire rice optical map data set into  <dig> equally sized bins for their independent assembly into provisional contigs that serve as "seeds" for augmentation and growth into larger, more confident map scaffolds. our initial procedure does not construct finished chromosome contigs, but does break the very large map data set into parallel, computationally manageable portions easily handled by the computer memory requirements of the map assembler  <cit> . the assembly step used for each bin produces a group of "consensus maps," or restriction maps comprising all significant restriction enzyme cleavage sites found within their respective contigs. the removal of redundant maps and the merging of overlapping consensus maps foster their subsequent utility.

2) growing contigs from seed maps
the previous step generates a set of seed maps. this process also culls high-quality optical maps from very large data sets; however, for completeness, nascent contigs  must be joined and merged for spanning entire chromosomes. we accomplish this through pairwise alignment of the complete map data set against the entire collection of seed maps. this operation accumulates "piles" of independently aligned single molecule maps that are then isolated from their seed map scaffolds and separately assembled into contigs using the map assembler. the previous step produces an updated generation of seed maps that are merged for identification of redundant maps, which are then removed. these assemblies are augmented through  <dig> iterations of the contig growing process.

after such iterations, the number of unique optical map contigs dropped from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average contig size of  <dig>  mb spanning  <dig>  mb. at this stage, joining operations deal with ends of contigs that result from issues specific to optical mapping. here, contigs produce gaps within genomic regions like centromeres with a low density of swai restriction sites in rice genome, or through incorporation of low quality maps stemming from chimeric molecules . therefore manual intervention removes low quality maps for restarting the contig growing process. manual steps that test gaps for potential growth also ensure proper placement of bona fide contig ends within telomeric regions. such manual steps were then validated by disassembly of map contigs into their original collection of maps, followed by new assemblies and joining operations.

using this scheme,  <dig> optical consensus maps were assembled having a total mass of  <dig>  mb. of these, there were  <dig> finished optical map contigs representing chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  identified based on the comparison between the consensus maps and the in silico maps from the irgsp pseudomolecules. although  <dig> optical map contigs were produced,  <dig> out of the  <dig> chromosomes reached completion . aside from the lack of gaps within these maps, we consider them finished because each map contig shows more than  <dig> single molecule maps defining each of the two blunt ends  – these sharply demarcated contig ends likely represent telomeric ends. the remaining  <dig> chromosomes have gaps occurring within centromeres  – showing two blunt ends within telomeric regions – and a blunt-ended contig  spanning a telomeric region on the long arm, but not fully covering the short arm. here lies the nucleolar organizer harboring ribosomal repeats having a low density of swai restriction sites that prevent joining operations.

genome-wide comparisons between optical and other physical maps
there are four genome-wide physical maps available for the rice genome and salient findings concerning chromosomal sizes are compared to optical mapping data in table  <dig>  the first is a molecular linkage map or genetic map with  <dig>  rflp or cdna clone probes  <cit> . the second is a yac-based physical map based on  <dig>  dna markers from the rice genetic map used to select  <dig>  yacs from a library to generate  <dig> yac contigs, and  <dig> yac islands – it uniquely spans  <dig> mb  <cit> . the third is a whole genome transcript map with  <dig>  mapped est markers which greatly helped to position the pac/bac clones throughout the rice genome  <cit> . the fourth is the sequence-ready bac/pac physical map, and these bac/pacs were anchored and oriented on the genetic map which forged a minimum tiling path of bac/pac clones for each of the  <dig> rice chromosomes – it comprises  <dig>  bac/pac clones showing  <dig> gaps  <cit> .

*ch. = chromosome; est. = estimated; ar = arm ratio; opt. = optical; ave. = average; frag. = fragment; sd = standard deviation; cov. = coverage; f = finished; difference = |estimated size-optical map size|/optical map size*100%; mol. no.: the number of single molecule maps were used to build the chromosome optical map contig; x coverage = /. a estimated chromosome size is based on the yac and bac physical map  <cit> ; b estimated chromosome size is based on the bac/pac physical map  <cit> ; c estimated chromosome size by pachytene fish  <cit> . d international rice genome sequencing project  <cit> . epredicted chromosome size = the optical map sizes + gap sizes  + missing small fragment sizes .

the optical map  of the rice genome consists of  <dig> optical map contigs with a total mass of  <dig>  mb –  <dig> are finished chromosomal contigs, and the other  <dig> cover the remaining  <dig> chromosomes , with chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> spanned by  <dig> optical map contigs, harboring gaps at the centromeric regions, and with chromosome  <dig> spanned by  <dig> optical map contig, harboring a gap at the nucleolar organizer comprising ribosomal repeats . although, these  <dig> centromeric and  <dig> telomeric or subtelomeric gaps located within the ribosomal dna repeat region are not confidently bridged or extended by optical mapping data, map data within these structurally important regions were used to estimate the size of such gaps, and consequently the size of these chromosomes.

comparison of chromosome size predicted by optical mapping and pachytene fish
in addition to physical maps, cytogenetic data was used to size the  <dig> rice chromosome arm ratios using pachytene fish  <cit> ; these findings are also listed in table  <dig>  compared to our optical mapping data, the size measurements for chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  based on pachytene fish data differ by more than 30%, but the size measurements for chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  are very similar by these two approaches. regarding the long and short chromosome arm ratios, it has been suggested that the long and short arms should be reversed for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  based on our optical mapping data, only the long and short arms for chromosome  <dig> need to be reversed, and the long and short arms for chromosome  <dig> are almost equal, with the long arm slightly longer than the short arm. the arm ratios for chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> determined by pachytene fish  are quite different from those determined by optical mapping ; however, both methods are concordant for arm ratios of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

assessment of optical mapping errors
as the rice genome sequence is finished, the accuracy of the swai optical maps was assessed by the comparison of optical maps against the in silico maps of the sequence data. as such, we used the map assembler to align in silico restriction maps created from both irgsp  and tigr  pseudomolecules against our optical mapping data. these results are shown in table  <dig> and  <dig> which globally summarize optical mapping accuracy in terms of restriction fragment identification and sizing vs. in silico maps created from sequence data . the comparisons between optical maps and the in silico maps of the  <dig> pseudomolecule sequences from irgsp showed that there were  <dig>  aligned map restriction fragments with a total mass of  <dig>  mb  . the comparison between optical maps and the in silico maps of the  <dig> pseudomolecule sequences from tigr showed that there were  <dig>  well-aligned map restriction fragments with a total mass of  <dig>  mb  .

*ch. = chromosome, ave. = average; frag. = fragment; centr. = centromeric; a the predicted chromosome size based on optical map was used as the total mass to compute the percentage of the matching fragment mass. gap or misassembly masses in the alignments were calculated based on the optical mapping data.

fragment sizes represented by optical and corresponding in silico maps differ by an average of  <dig> % from irgsp , and  <dig> % from tigr  rice sequence data. a plot  comparing the sizes of corresponding restriction fragments within optical and in silico maps   show excellent agreement, confirmed by linear regression analysis , with a sd of  <dig>  kb . such sizing accuracy was also reflected by the average absolute size difference between corresponding optical and in silico restriction fragments . the total mass of the plotted optical map fragments of chromosome  <dig> is  <dig> . <dig> kb, which is  <dig>  kb smaller  than the total in silico fragment mass from irgsp chromosome  <dig> sequence.

comparisons between optical maps and the rice genome sequence
the above analysis of errors of the optical map vs. sequence on a per fragment basis is an important primary consideration for any evaluation of size measurement accuracy; however, discordances stemming from map or sequence assembly errors become apparent through global alignment procedures  – optical vs. sequence alignments are shown in fig  <dig>  see additional data file  <dig> and  <dig> for comprehensive tables covering aforementioned discordances. the alignments between optical maps and the irgsp sequence pseudomolecules, , identified  <dig>  swai congruent restriction sites,  <dig> false cuts,  <dig> missing cuts, and  <dig> missing small fragments  within the optical consensus map data. the alignments also identified  <dig> telomeric gaps with a total size of  <dig>  kb,  <dig> centromeric gaps with a total estimated size of  <dig>  kb,  <dig> sequence gaps filled by optical maps with a total size of  <dig>  kb, and  <dig> new gaps called by optical maps within the sequence with a total size of  <dig>  kb . in the irgsp sequence pseudomolecules, sequence physical gaps were represented as consecutive "ns", with the gap sizes defined. these gaps can be oversized or undersized through comparison to optical maps . the alignments between optical maps and the tigr sequence pseudomolecules, , identified  <dig>  swai congruent restriction sites,  <dig> false cuts,  <dig> missing cuts, and  <dig> missing small fragments  within the optical consensus map data. the alignments also identified  <dig> telomeric gaps with a total size of  <dig>  kb,  <dig> centromeric gaps with a total estimated size of  <dig>  kb,  <dig> non-centromeric sequence gaps filled by optical maps with a total size of  <dig>  kb, and  <dig> new gaps  called within the sequence based on the map alignments with a total size of  <dig>  kb . within the tigr sequence pseudomolecules,  <dig> physical gaps  are represented by strings of  <dig> kb "ns" with gap sizes undefined. accordingly, figure  <dig> shows that larger gaps are spanned by optical maps in pseudomolecules from irgsp as compared with those from tigr, especially within centromeric gaps.

some portions of the in silico maps of the sequence pseudomolecules could not be properly aligned with the optical maps, indicating potential sequence assembly issues – these regions are indicated in fig.  <dig>  overall, there are  <dig> putative misassemblies, covering  <dig>  kb, identified on the basis of alignments between optical and in silico maps of the irgsp sequence pseudomolecules, and there are  <dig> putative misassemblies, covering  <dig>  kb, identified on the basis of alignments between optical and in silico maps of the tigr sequence pseudomolecules. these misassembly errors in the pseudomolecule data , are categorized in three ways: 1) additional sequence in the pseudomolecule data, 2) inversions, and 3) frank large-scale misassemblies, which exhibit a series of discordances, to include gaps, or extra sequence data – typical examples are graphically depicted in fig.  <dig>  some misassembly errors are shared by both irgsp and tigr sequence pseudomolecules such as fig. 5f, and some may be unique to each sequence assembly such as fig. 5c, d, and 5e. the inversion in fig. 5f was also detected by comparing the whole-genome shotgun and map-based sequences of the rice genome.

discussion
we have constructed a whole genome swai restriction map for the rice genome  using a modified whole genome shotgun optical mapping approach that was used to identify problematic regions within the current sequence build. the whole genome optical map consists of  <dig> optical map contigs, of which  <dig> are finished chromosome optical map contigs. among the remaining  <dig> chromosomes, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> each composed of two optical map contigs with gaps at the centromeric regions, and  <dig> only has one optical map contig with gap at the nucleolar organizer ribosomal repeat and telomeric regions. maps, by definition, do not posses the same resolution as sequence, so that map alignments to sequence reveal discordances governed by experimental factors that hinge on the average restriction fragment size, or "resolution" of the final map, which is limited by reliable detection of small restriction fragments, sizing errors, and the extent of genome coverage  <cit> . alignments between the optical and in silico maps, derived from irgsp and tigr sequence pseudomolecules or virtual contigs, enabled us to fully place such sequence data along map scaffolds. these alignments revealed a high degree of concordance  and provided a largely independent way to assess the errors in the rice genome sequence assembly. perhaps more importantly, map-sequence alignments have characterized a number of gaps, which may be difficult to assess using other approaches.

the estimated genome size of rice genome is  <dig>  mb – after summing the masses of all the  <dig> estimated chromosome sizes estimated based on optical mapping , three optical map gaps estimated based on other studies  <cit>  , and all the missing small fragments  in the optical maps based on the map alignments between optical maps and the in silico maps of irgsp sequence pseudomolecules. comparisons with other genome or chromosome size estimations based on bac/pac or yac physical maps, show that genome and chromosome size estimates based on optical mapping are mostly smaller, but were very close to the most recent estimation of genome size  based on the minimum tiles of bac/pac clone sequences for each chromosome  <cit> . however, the size estimate for chromosome  <dig> is quite different from that estimated by optical mapping . the difference between our optical map-based chromosome size and the irgsp sequence and map-based chromosome is mainly due to the different number of copies of rice rrna genes used for the size estimation. irgsp used  <dig> copies of rice rrna genes to estimate the length of chromosome  <dig> short arm nucleolar organizer dna, which is calculated to be  <dig>  mb, but in fact, this copy number is for a diploid genome  <cit> . we used half of this number, which is  <dig> copies of rrna genes to calculate the size of the ribosomal repeat region , because the genome sequence is haploid.

the chromosome size measurements and the arm ratios determined by pachytene fish  <cit>  and optical mapping are quite different. here chromosome sizes were mostly overestimated except for chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the arm ratios were overestimated for chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , but were underestimated for chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . our results confirmed that the long and short arms of chromosome  <dig> should be reversed, but not for chromosome  <dig>  the sizing discrepancies between pachytene fish and optical mapping estimates for chromosome sizes and arm ratios reflect fundamental differences in how dna intervals are measured and the number of markers used for analysis. in pachytene fish, distances between markers is measured as an actual distance  using difficult to control chromatin substrates – varying degrees of condensation can affect the accuracy of distance measurements in a locus-specific way. for example, size estimate for the short arm of chromosome  <dig> was significantly underestimated by pachytene fish probably due to the presence of heterochromatic or at-rich sequences; while the sizes of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were significantly overestimated by pachytene fish, because these chromosomes are mostly composed of euchromatic sequences  <cit> . these issues are largely obviated in optical mapping since the mapping substrate is just naked, fully deproteinized dna molecules, and "distances" are robustly estimated by measurement of integrated fluorescence intensity  <cit>  using a dye , whose measured fluorescence intensity is somewhat insensitive to base composition or extent of dna elongation. consequently, the chromosome sizes presented in this paper are likely to be more accurate than those determined by pachytene fish.

comparisons between the optical maps and the in silico maps from the irgsp and tigr sequence pseudomolecules showed that additional gaps exist in the sequence pseudomolecules than what has been reported. there are  <dig> gaps  recorded in the irgsp sequence pseudomolecules which are represented by consecutive "n" with gap sizes defined  <cit> . sixty of the  <dig> gaps were bridged by optical maps, and the two gaps not bridged were located at the centromeric regions of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  there are additional  <dig> gaps  plus  <dig> misassemblies present in the irgsp sequence pseuodomolecules detected by the comparative analysis between optical maps and the in silico maps of the irgsp sequence pseudomolecules. these misassemblies usually contain swai restriction site differences , and some of them may bear gaps. in tigr rice genome sequence pseudomolecules  <cit> , the  <dig> physical gaps  were recorded, and  <dig> of these gaps were spanned by optical maps based on the map aligments with the two unfilled gaps also located at the centromeric regions of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  comparative analysis between optical maps and the in silico maps of the tigr sequence pseuodomolecules showed that there are additional  <dig> gaps , plus  <dig> misassemblies existed in the tigr rice genome sequence pseudomolecules. overall, the tigr sequence pseudomolecules show less discordance with our findings than the irgsp sequence pseudomolecules as judged by comparison of in silico vs. optical mapping fragment masses and reduced prevalence of sequence misassemblies despite discovery of additional gaps within sequence assemblies. about 70% of these gaps and 50% of of misassemblies are common to both irgsp and tigr sequence pseudomolecules . as alignments between the optical and in silico maps of the sequence pseudomolecules locate gaps and their span, or possible misassembled sequences, those bac/pac clones from such problematic regions can be flagged for further sequence analysis. gaps can be closed using pcr or other molecular techniques, and misassembled sequences can be corrected based on the swai optical restriction maps.

the gap sizes estimated by optical mapping are likely to be more accurate than that estimated by genetic mapping or fibre fish and pachytene fish physical mapping  <cit> . the genome sequence and structure of rice chromosome  <dig> was reported in  <dig>  <cit>  with  <dig> large sequence contigs and  <dig> gaps. two gaps were closed and five gaps in the arm regions still remain in the current irgsp build  <dig> pseudomolecules  <cit>  the gap sizes previously estimated by genetic marker or fibre fish and pachytene fish are shown in figure  <dig>  alignments between the in silico maps of the rice chromosome  <dig> sequence pseudomolecules and the optical maps can easily reveal the gap sizes between the contigs based on where the consecutive "ns" located, and the gap sizes are also shown in figure  <dig> based on the measurements of the optical maps. the centromeric and telomeric gaps, and the five internal chromosome arm gaps between the sequence contigs were measured to be  <dig>  kb in total by genetic markers and fibre or pachytene fish, while these gaps were measured by optical mapping were shown to be only  <dig> kb, which is less than one half of the estimation by genetic markers and fibre or pachytene fish. in the tigr sequence pseudomolecule release  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> sequence pseudomolecule has six chromosome internal gaps, and five out of them are at the same locations as in irgsp chromosome  <dig> sequence pseudomolecule based on the optical map , however, there are  <dig> kb sequence inserted in gap  <dig> , which does not belong to this region and appears to be combined from sequences of multiple chromosomes based on the optical map . we have tried to use pcr to close the gap  <dig> and  <dig> based on irgsp chromosome  <dig> sequence, and failed to generate expected unique amplicons probably due to sequence repeat elements. other approaches are likely required in order to close these gaps.

the centromeric regions of chromosomes found in higher eukaryotes are a complex motif of repetitive sequences. consequently, comprehensive basepair level knowledge of centromeric regions is at the frontier of genome sequencing technology presenting challenges to cloning, mapping and assembly  <cit> . although rice centromeres are analyzable by optical mapping, mammalian centromeres, being larger and more complex, may challenge our ability to span regions bearing few restriction sites with ~ <dig> kb molecules. as such, it is understandable that from previous studies that the centromeres of only chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have been fully mapped and sequenced. here, we have fully mapped  <dig> complete centromeric regions, with the remaining chromosomes being partly characterized . accordingly, comparisons of optical map findings for the centromeric region of chromosome  <dig> against irgsp and tigr results showed that a ~ <dig> kb gap still exists both in the irgsp and tigr pseudomolecules , while chromosome  <dig> showed no discordances.

CONCLUSIONS
a whole-genome swai restriction map of rice genome was constructed and comparison between the in silico maps of rice chromosome pseudomolecule sequences revealed not only gap characteristics, but also putatively misassembled parts of the genome sequence. we think that this whole genome optical map will greatly facilitate gap closure efforts and guide correction of misassemblies to provide an accurate and completely sequenced model for plant genome research – especially for cereal genomes. as our optical mapping system has achieved a high-degree of automation, now we can produce a whole genome optical map like rice genome with only a fraction of the cost for sequencing. we envision optical mapping employed as a new platform for comparative genomics to study closely related varieties, or cultivars, that would leverage sequence and annotation information across a broad range of rice subspecies and varieties.
