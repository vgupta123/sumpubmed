BACKGROUND
pseudomonas chlororaphis strain pa <dig> is a biocontrol agent able to protect canola from stem rot disease caused by the fungus sclerotinia sclerotiorum  de bary  <cit> . this bacterium produces a number of compounds including phenazine 1-carboxylic acid , 2-hydroxyphenazine , pyrrolnitrin, protease, lipase, chitinase and siderophores, some of which have been shown to contribute to fungal antagonism  <cit> . public concern over the use of chemical pesticides together with the potential for acquiring resistance to these compounds has led to renewed interest in bacterial antagonists, such as pa <dig>  for biocontrol. despite demonstrating excellent disease control in the greenhouse, many biocontrol agents suffer from inconsistent performance in the field  <cit> . poor field performance is likely due, at least in part, to variable expression of genes and gene products required for disease suppression. it is essential, therefore, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms mediating pa <dig> biocontrol so that production of the pathogen-suppressing factor can be optimized in the environment.

in pseudomonas spp. that act as biocontrol agents, expression of disease-suppressive metabolites is controlled by a multi-tiered network of regulation. one of the key regulatory elements is the gacs/gaca two-component signal transduction system, comprised of the sensor kinase gacs and its cognate response regulator gaca  <cit> . in many pseudomonads, including pa <dig>  a mutation in gacs or gaca leads to a loss of fungal antagonism  <cit> . working in concert with gacs/gaca is the rsm system which consists of rsma-like repressor proteins and untranslated regulatory rnas. the repressor proteins act post-transcriptionally by binding to the ribosome-binding site  in target mrna  <cit> . the regulatory rnas antagonize repression by titrating out the rsma-like proteins, rendering the rbs of target genes accessible to the translational machinery  <cit> . additional regulatory elements that oversee production of pa <dig> antifungal metabolites include the phzr/phzi quorum-sensing  circuit  <cit> , the stationary phase sigma factor rpos  <cit> , a regulator of rpos called psra  <cit> , and a global stress response system known as the stringent response  <cit> . substantial interaction occurs between the regulators themselves, which adds to the complexity of the regulatory hierarchy  <cit> .

through transposon mutagenesis, a pa <dig> mutant was identified that exhibited a complete loss of antifungal activity, similar to what is observed for a gac mutant  <cit> . sequence analysis revealed that the interrupted gene, designated ptra , encodes a protein belonging to the lysr-type transcriptional regulator  family. lttrs can act as either activators or repressors and are known to control a diverse range of metabolic functions including cell invasion and virulence, qs, oxidative stress, and amino acid metabolism  <cit> . given the remarkably complex regulatory network that oversees the production of antifungal compounds, the aim of the current study was to understand the global impact of the ptra mutation on pa <dig> protein expression. using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation  technique,  <dig> proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the ptra mutant compared to the wild type. changes in protein expression were confirmed by phenotypic assays that showed reduced phenazine and chitinase expression, elevated flagellar motility and siderophore production, as well as early entrance into the logarithmic growth phase.

RESULTS
isolation of a pseudomonas chlororaphis pa <dig> mutant deficient in antifungal activity
approximately  <dig> transconjugants were screened in radial diffusion plate assays to identify mutants displaying increased or decreased antifungal activity compared to the wild type. one mutant was identified, pa23- <dig>  that exhibited no antifungal activity and was white in colour, indicating a loss of phenazine production  <cit>  . dna flanking the tn exhibited 89% identity at the amino acid level to a pseudomonas fluorescens lttr . the newly identified gene was designated ptra. to verify that the phenotype of pa23- <dig> was due to ptra inactivation, the ptra gene was pcr amplified and cloned into pucp <dig> for complementation. the presence of pucp22-ptra restored antifungal activity to that of the wild type .

sequence analysis revealed that the site of tn insertion lies 803 bp downstream of the ptra translational start , which is predicted to disrupt the co-inducer recognition/response domain  <cit> . previous studies of the lttrs nodd and nahr revealed that mutations in this region result in a co-inducer-independent phenotype which affects dna binding and thus the activation/repression properties of the proteins  <cit> . directly downstream of ptra but in the opposite orientation lies a gene encoding a protein that is 99% identical at the amino acid level to a doxx-family protein found in p. chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca pb-st <dig> . based on sequence similarity, doxx could be involved in pathways related to elemental sulfur oxidation  <cit> . immediately upstream of ptra, in the opposite orientation, lies a gene encoding a short-chain dehydrogenase . short-chain dehydrogenases are part of a superfamily of enzymes designated as the nad- or nadp-dependent short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases . the sdrs comprise a very large grouping of biologically important proteins found in virtually all forms of life  <cit> . at present, it is unclear whether the genes upstream and downstream of ptra play a role in regulation.

through blastn analysis, ptra homologs were found within the genomes of several pseudomonas species, with the highest degree of nucleotide identity exhibited by pseudomonas sp. uw <dig> , followed by pseudomonas protegens strains pf- <dig>  and cha <dig> , pseudomonas fluorescens strains pf0- <dig>  and f <dig> , pseudomonas brassicacearum subsp. brassicacearum nfm <dig> , pseudomonas poae re*1-1- <dig> , and pseudomonas resinovorans nbrc  <dig>   <cit> . collectively, our findings indicate that ptra is a newly identified regulator of pa <dig> biocontrol, and homologs of this regulator are present in a number of pseudomonas species.

differential protein expression between the pa <dig> wild type and the ptra mutant
ptra belongs to the lttr family, which is the largest known family of prokaryotic dna binding proteins  <cit> . lttrs can function as either repressors or activators for single or operonic genes. furthermore, these regulators may be divergently transcribed from their target genes or may control expression of numerous genes scattered about the chromosome  <cit> . in pa <dig>  expression of antifungal metabolites is governed by a complex network of regulatory elements and substantial interaction occurs between the regulators themselves  <cit> . to understand the global impact of the ptra mutation on pa <dig> physiology, itraq proteomic analysis was carried out to reveal proteins that were differentially expressed between the pa <dig> wild type and the ptra mutant. a total of  <dig> proteins were matched to proteins found within the p. chlororaphis gp <dig> reference genome  <cit> . fifty nine of these proteins were differentially expressed between the two strains, exhibiting a vector difference  greater than or equal to + <dig>  and less than or equal to − <dig> , corresponding to proteins in the upper or lower 10% of the population distribution . the  <dig> proteins could be classified into  <dig> clusters of orthologous groups  based on their predicted function. figure  <dig> summarizes the classification of the identified proteins, indicating significant up- or downregulation of protein expression. the largest cog category was the unknown function group, suggesting that many yet-to-be-identified proteins play a role in the loss of biocontrol exhibited by pa23- <dig>

ptra regulates phenazine production in pa23
the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism cog category represented the next largest grouping . initially, two of the proteins  were classified under the general function category and one protein  was categorized under the transport and metabolism grouping. upon further investigation, the locus tags indicated that they are part of the phenazine biosynthetic operon, leading to their reclassification into the secondary metabolite biosynthesis cog.

the phenazine operon has been well characterized in many pseudomonads, with phzabcdefg comprising the core biosynthetic locus  <cit> . in this study, proteins with locus tags mok_ <dig> and mok_ <dig>  identified as phenazine biosynthesis protein a/b, were significantly downregulated . all phenazine-producing pseudomonads have an adjacent and nearly identical copy of the phzb gene, termed phza <cit> . phza catalyzes the condensation reaction of two ketone molecules in the phenazine biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . phzf  works as an isomerase, converting trans- <dig> -dihydro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid  into 6-amino-5-oxocyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid prior to the condensation reaction catalyzed by the phza/b proteins  <cit> . phzg encodes an fmn-dependent pyridoxamine oxidase , which is hypothesized to catalyze the conversion of dhha to  <dig> -dihydro-pca  <cit> . in some pseudomonads, genes downstream of the core biosynthetic operon are required for generation of phenazine derivatives  <cit> . in p. chlororaphis 30– <dig>  for example, phzo lies downstream of the core operon; phzo is an aromatic hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of pca into 2-oh-phz  <cit> . more recently, in p. chlororaphis gp <dig>  the phzo gene was shown to convert pca into 2-oh-phz through a 2-oh-pca intermediate  <cit> . like other p. chlororaphis strains, pa <dig> produces 2-oh-phz and we believe the downregulated aromatic ring hydroxylase  is phzo. therefore, in the absence of a functional ptra gene, four of the core phenazine biosynthetic enzymes  and one aromatic ring hydroxylase  are significantly downregulated. the fact that ptra plays a critical role in regulating phz expression was not surprising considering the lack of orange pigment produced by the ptra mutant . reduced phenazine expression was further substantiated by quantitative assays. as illustrated in figure 2b, there is a 15-fold decrease in phenazine production in pa23- <dig> compared to the pa <dig> wild type. when ptra was expressed in trans, some restoration of phenazine production was achieved.

chitinase production is under ptra control
our itraq proteomic results showed that two chitinase enzymes  were significantly downregulated in the pa23- <dig> mutant . these results were supported by chitinase assays, which clearly indicated no detectable enzyme activity in the ptra mutant . addition of plasmid-borne ptra elevated chitinase activity close to that of the wild type . collectively our findings indicate that ptra is necessary for chitinase production. the lttr, chir, has been previously shown to indirectly regulate all chitinases produced in serratia marcescens  <dig>  <cit> . proteomic analysis of a p. aeruginosa gaca mutant revealed that chitinase  and a chitin-binding protein  were decreased 8-fold and  <dig> -fold respectively, as compared to the wild type  <cit> .

siderophore production is upregulated in pa23- <dig> compared to the pa <dig> wild type
in the ptra mutant, a lipoprotein involved in iron transport  was found to be significantly upregulated . this finding prompted us to explore whether the mutant exhibited elevated siderophore expression. siderophores are thought to contribute to biocontrol by sequestering iron, thereby restricting pathogen growth. following 24 hours growth on cas agar plates, mutant pa23- <dig> showed a 3-fold increase in the size of the orange halo surrounding the colony, indicating increased siderophore production compared to the wild type . as expected, overexpression of ptra restored the wild-type phenotype. since the ptra mutant expresses significantly increased levels of siderophore but exhibits a complete loss of antifungal activity, it is clear that elevated siderophore expression alone is not sufficient for s. sclerotiorum control.

loss of ptra results in early entry into stationary phase
we observed significant upregulation of proteins involved in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis in the ptra mutant . these proteins include a translation elongation factor , a trna amidotransferase  and ribosomal proteins l <dig> and s <dig>  which make up structural components of both the large and small ribosomal subunits of the 70s ribonucleoprotein complex  <cit>  . to determine whether pa23- <dig> exhibited an altered pattern of growth compared to the wild type, growth rate analysis was undertaken. as depicted in figure  <dig>  the mutant enters the logarithmic  growth phase around hour  <dig>  which starts to plateau by hour  <dig>  conversely, the pa <dig> wild type does not enter log phase until hour  <dig>  ending with entrance into early stationary phase at 19 hours of growth. another interesting difference observed was the maximum population density achieved. the pa <dig> wild type consistently reached a higher od <dig> in stationary phase compared to pa23- <dig> . a similar altered pattern of growth has been observed for gacs mutants of pa <dig> and 30– <dig> which exhibit a shorter lag phase and earlier entry into logarithmic growth phase  <cit> . lttrs have previously been implicated in the regulation of cellular growth factors. for example, the well-studied lttr oxyr is involved in regulating the expression of various metabolic genes such as trna nucleotidyl transferases and synthetases, ribosomal proteins and qs-regulated targets  <cit> .

ptra negatively affects motility
our itraq proteomic data indicated upregulation of the flagellin and related hook-associated protein  in pa23- <dig>  further inspection of the locus tags upstream of mok_ <dig> also indicated upregulation of proteins flig  and flis , although this upregulation was not considered significant. the upregulated flagellin and related hook-associated protein, therefore, is likely part of the fli operon based on its proximity to upstream genes. to verify the results of the proteomic analysis, motility assays were conducted. as outlined in table  <dig>  swimming  motility was almost 3-fold greater in pa23- <dig> compared to the wild type, indicating that ptra is having a repressive effect on this phenotype. in a similar fashion, proteomic analysis of a p. aeruginosa gaca mutant revealed a  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold increase in expression of a flagellin  and flagellar-capping protein , respectively  <cit> . introduction of ptra in trans caused a modest reduction in motility, but did not fully restore the wild-type phenotype. it is important to bear in mind that for our complementation studies, multiple copies of the ptra gene were provided rather than a single chromosomal copy. because lttrs bind both activation binding sites and regulatory binding sites upstream of target genes  <cit> , the number of copies of the regulator may be of critical importance for proper binding and subsequent regulation of target genes. this observation was noted with complementation studies involving the lttr oxyr in restoration of rhamnolipid and pyocyanin production in p. aeruginosa <cit> . when multiple copies of oxyr were present in the cell, the wild-type phenotype was not restored; whereas insertion of single chromosomal copy of the lttr gene resulted in full complementation  <cit> .

ptra regulates pyrrolnitrin production in pa23
based on itraq analysis, a tryptophan halogenase  was identified under the amino acid transport and metabolism cog category, but was not significantly differentially expressed in the ptra mutant . at locus tag mok_ <dig>  another chlorinating halogenase was identified in the p. chlororaphis gp <dig> genome, but was not differentially expressed in the ptra mutant. these enzymes are likely prna and prnc, forming part of the prnabcd pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic operon  <cit> . subsequent pyrrolnitrin quantification via hplc analysis revealed that wild type pa <dig> produced an average of  <dig>   μg of pyrrolnitrin, whereas in the ptra mutant, no pyrrolnitrin was detected. however, when ptra was expressed in trans in pa23- <dig>  pyrrolnitrin production was restored to wild-type levels . significant downregulation of pyrrolnitrin expression may not have been identified through itraq analysis as cell samples were taken at the onset of stationary phase. to obtain enough pyrrolnitrin for quantification, cell culture extracts are routinely performed after five days of growth  <cit> . thus, there may have been differences in protein expression in late stationary phase that were not detected in our itraq analysis. as pyrrolnitrin has previously been reported as essential for pa <dig> biocontrol  <cit> , the lack of pyrrolnitrin production by the ptra mutant is likely a major contributor to the loss of antifungal activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we describe the characterization of a pa <dig> derivative with a mutation in a gene encoding a novel transcriptional regulator, designated ptra. as the mutant is no longer capable of suppressing the fungal pathogen s. sclerotiorum, ptra is essential for pa <dig> biocontrol. it is apparent that ptra affects many facets of pa <dig> physiology. differential protein expression was observed across  <dig> different cog categories, indicating that ptra is likely acting as a global transcriptional regulator. one of the limitations associated with this study stems from the fact that our proteomic analysis was based on the p. chlororaphis gp <dig> reference genome. in the future, the availability of the pa <dig> genome sequence may allow us to better understand the function of these differentially expressed proteins. in addition, several aspects of ptra regulation have yet to be revealed, for example, lttrs are frequently autoregulated and co-inducer molecules profoundly impact binding specificity  <cit> . we are currently investigating the dna targets of ptra transcriptional regulation, including ptra itself. furthermore, the nature of the ptra effector and its role in binding has yet to be discovered. it is hoped that by unraveling the complex regulatory hierarchy overseeing production of antifungal compounds, this bacterium can be used in a consistent and predictable manner for suppression of s. sclerotiorum in the field.
