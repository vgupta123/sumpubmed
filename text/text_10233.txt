BACKGROUND
transfer rnas  are members of a family of ubiquitous molecules that provide the essential link between the genetic code and amino acids. trnas are a central component of ribosomal protein biosynthesis that acts by decoding template messenger rna  into the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. although the mechanistic role of trna in protein synthesis is well understood, evidence illustrating the complexity of evolution and expression of trna genes continues to emerge  <cit> .

the trna multigene family usually comprises  <dig> amino acid accepting groups; each group may contain one or more trna members that recognize different codons commonly referred to as trna isoacceptors. generally, the number of trna isoacceptors is highly variable amongst different genomes  <cit> . while variations in trna isoacceptor numbers is positively correlated to codon usage in bacteria and yeast  <cit> , such correlation is absent in more advanced eukaryotic genomes such as frogs and humans  <cit> . trna isoacceptors usually exhibit close sequence similarity as they conserve the same sequence and structural elements used for identification by the same class of aminoacyl-trna synthetases  <cit> . however, in some cases trnas that charge different amino acids share higher sequence similarity than respective trnas in the same isoaccepting group  <cit> . this interesting observation may be explained by a phenomenon called "trna gene recruitment" where a trna from one amino acid family can be recruited to another family via a single point mutation  <cit> . these trna gene recruitment events complicate the evolutionary history of trna genes. however, a phylogenetic approach utilizing complete sets of trna genes from different genomes will allow us to trace a more complete history of trna genes and gain insight into the evolutionary processes that have shaped modern trna repertoires.

with the advent of multiple genome sequencing projects, entire trna repertoires have been identified in many genomes. while features of trna genes are well defined, predicting functional trna genes in eukaryotic genomes can be difficult. sequencing of vertebrate genomes revealed that trna-derived sequences are often contained within retrotransposon insertions that give rise to different families of short interspersed elements   <cit> . in the genomes of animals, the number of sines present often exceeds  <dig>  <cit> . for example, approximately  <dig> % of the bos taurus genome is predicted to comprise of sines containing trna-derived sequences  <cit> . these complications present a serious challenge for the accurate annotation of biochemically active trna genes as sines often retain many sequence and structural features of the authentic trna genes  <cit> .

identification of functional non-coding rnas in genomic sequences depends heavily on the analysis of conserved rna secondary structure in order to make accurate predictions  <cit> . the most commonly used program for making trna predictions is trnascan-se  <cit> , a program that analyzes intrinsic features of known functional trna genes including the internal pol iii promoter sites and conserved trna secondary structure. however, trnascan-se produces large numbers of false positives in genomes where trna related sequences and sines are common  <cit> . for the prediction and annotation of mouse trna genes, the strategy to counter this problem was to identify sines that have been predicted as trna genes and use comparative genomics to identify functional trna genes  <cit> . in that study, sines were identified using repeatmasker  <cit> , a program that identifies putative repeat elements in genomic sequences by comparison to a pre-compiled database of repetitive elements. although repeatmasker can effectively identify many genomic repeat sequences, it is unable to identify novel lineage-specific sines. to overcome this, a comparative genomics approach using the human genome was used to identify sets of orthologous trna genes that are probably functional. this strategy allowed the refining of a large set of putative mouse trna genes  to a smaller set of possibly functional mouse trna genes   <cit> .

for our analysis of the b. taurus genome, we were challenged by a large number of trna-like sequences due to sine activity. in order to provide a comprehensive annotation of functional trna genes in the b. taurus genome we used a combination of approaches which involved trnascan-se, repeatmasker and comparative genomics to overcome the issue of sines. we then conducted cluster analyses on our set of putative trna genes, to gain insight into the evolutionary histories of cow trna genes. this in turn will help further the understanding of trna gene evolution.

RESULTS
identification of cow trna genes
the initial analysis of the cow genome using trnascan-se identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  trna-like sequences positioned evenly across assembled cow chromosomes and unordered genomic contigs respectively . of these sequences,  <dig>  and  <dig>  on the assembled chromosomes and unordered contigs respectively were classified as pseudogenes by trnascan-se. together this is by far the largest reported number of trna-like sequences amongst vertebrate genomes, demonstrating the extent of amplification of trna-derived sequences in the cow. in comparison similar analyses performed in other mammals identified a total of  <dig>  trna genes and  <dig>  pseudogenes in the mouse genome  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  trna genes and pseudogenes in the rat genome  <cit>  and  <dig> trna genes and  <dig> trna pseudogenes in the human genome  <cit> . all these data illustrate a great variability in trna-derived sequence copy numbers owing mainly to the activity of sines  <cit> . given the large numbers of trna-like sequences identified in our initial analysis, we reasoned that the remaining sets of  <dig>  and  <dig>  putative trna genes on assembled chromosomes and unordered contigs respectively are likely to contain sines and trna-related sequences that were misclassified as trna genes by trnascan-se. to address this problem, we used repeatmasker to identity repetitive elements.

identification of repetitive elements
following the trnascan-se analysis, repeatmasker identified the majority of trna gene predictions to be repetitive elements . of the total  <dig>  putative trna genes for the  <dig> standard amino acid families on both assembled chromosomes and unordered genomic contigs, repeatmasker annotated  <dig>  as repetitive elements, removing  <dig> % of the putative trna genes . similarly, of the total  <dig>  predicted trna genes on both assembled chromosomes and unordered genomic contigs, repeatmasker annotated  <dig>  as repetitive elements corresponding to  <dig> % of the predictions . after the initial repeatmasker filter, trna genes in the glutamic acid, glycine and lysine amino acid families were still represented in large numbers with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies respectively . similar observations of disproportionate increases in trna gene copy numbers of certain trna families can also be observed in the dog genome . we used a comparative genomics approach to further distinguish between functional trna genes and trna-related sequences.

defining a set of highly conserved vertebrate trna genes
sequences with functional activity are subject to selective pressures that prevent the fixation of mutations that would compromise functionality. in contrast, most repetitive elements have lost their functional activity and evolve neutrally by accumulating random mutations, which results in much weaker evolutionary conservation in these sequences  <cit> . by comparing trna gene sets of cow, horse, dog, human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, chicken and fugu, we found many highly conserved trna genes despite the evolutionary distances between the organisms. we found a unique set of  <dig> putative trna gene sequences that were completely identical in all of the genomes analyzed. many of these  <dig> unique trna sequences were present in more than one copy in cow. in total, this set consisted of a set of  <dig> trna genes from  <dig> amino acid families.

most other cow trna genes have accumulated at least one point mutation during the evolution of the vertebrates , since a trna gene may accumulate mutations while still retaining biological function. the 95% sequence similarity threshold used to identify a true set of cow trna genes corresponds to approximately  <dig> mismatches; this threshold also coincides with the end of the linear growth in cumulative trna counts on the plot . application of the 95% threshold value resulted in the identification of the  <dig> different genes, represented by  <dig> unique sequences that contain  <dig> trna isoacceptors , capable of decoding  <dig> of the  <dig> sense codons  according to the wobble rules proposed by gutherie and abelson  <cit> , where the codon's third position u and c are generally decoded by a single trna species. to identify trnas decoding the  <dig> codons not included in the set of trnas identified using the > = 95% sequence identity threshold, elongator methionine trna and trna directing the insertion of selenocysteine  we manually curated the relevant subsets of the  <dig>  putative trna genes. we found a further  <dig> unique trna sequences encoded by  <dig> genes . as a result, we provide a set of  <dig> cow trna genes represented by  <dig> unique trna genes capable of decoding all of the  <dig> sense codons . overall, the distribution of these  <dig> cow trna genes across the anticodons follows a similar trend as in the other vertebrate genomes .

1unique trnas are trna genes with at least  <dig> nucleotide difference from other genes with the same anticodon.

cluster analysis of  <dig> unique trna genes
the set of  <dig> unique trna gene sequences was examined using cluster analysis. trna genes that carry the same amino acid generally formed clusters with ≥  <dig>  posterior probability  . this observation concurs with the general consensus suggesting that trna genes that belong to the same amino acid family have evolved from a common trna. however not all trna genes in the same amino acid family formed clusters with a high pp value. trna genes from the serine, glutamatic acid, glycine, initiator methionine, threonine and arginine trna families could not be resolved to a single cluster. interestingly, the trna gene sequence for tryptophan lay within a family of arginine specific trna genes, supported by a pp value of  <dig>  while not all trna genes from the same amino acid family formed single clusters, most trna genes with the same anticodon clustered together. there were three exceptions; sertga, valtac and glyccc trna genes . this observation suggests that these trna genes may have different evolutionary histories. the multiple sequence alignment of glycine trna genes showed that the boxb site is identical in all glycine trna genes, point mutations were observed at other sites . a cluster analysis of unique trna-gly genes revealed two distinct trna-glyccc subfamilies . the first subfamily of trna-glyccc differs from the second subfamily of trna-glyccc that is closely related to the trna-glygcc genes. predicted secondary structures of these two trna-glyccc genes illustrate various differences throughout the structure . we analyzed the distribution of these two families of trna-glyccc genes among different genomes and find that the subfamily  <dig> trna-glyccc genes are highly conserved among human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, horse, dog, opossum, chicken, and fugu and usually present in two gene copies. however, only one member of this subfamily was observed in cow and no members of this subfamily were identified in the current assembly of the platypus genome . in contrast, subfamily  <dig> trna-glyccc genes appear to be only present in the mammals as no orthologs were detectable in the current assemblies of the chicken, lizard and fugu genomes.

phylogenetic profiles of putative cow trna genes
we created phylogenetic profiles of cow trna genes to identify the presence or absence of trna gene homologs in other genomes. we compared the cow trna gene repertoire to a representative set of genomes from mammals , fish , reptile , bird  and invertebrates . to be comprehensive we used the set of  <dig>  cow putative trna genes identified using trnascan-se and another  <dig>  putative trna genes from the other  <dig> genomes . of the total cow trna genes,  <dig> trna genes  had at least one match at ≥ 95% outside the cow genome . the most common phylogenetic profile identifies cow trna gene orthologs only among vertebrate genomes .

additionally, more cow trna orthologs are identified among genomes that are less phylogenetically diverged. using ≥ 95% sequence similarity threshold we identified, between  <dig> and  <dig> trna genes among mammalian genomes,  <dig> and  <dig> trna genes in chicken and lizard respectively and a range of  <dig> –  <dig> trna genes among fishes  comparing the total of  <dig>  putative cow trna genes. in contrast, only  <dig> –  <dig> cow trna genes were identified among invertebrate genomes using the same threshold .

distribution of trna genes in the cow genome
trna genes generally occur in clusters, some of which contain large numbers of genes. the cow genome contains a number of such large clusters, in particular on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the organisation of the genes in these clusters is generally very similar to the equivalent clusters in the human genome .

discussion
we performed a genome-wide analysis of the trna gene repertoire of the bos taurus genome. although our analyses were complicated by the wide spread distribution of sines, we were able to identify a representative set of trna genes in the cow. the impact of sines on trna gene prediction has been previously observed in other genomes. for example, the mouse genome contains over  <dig>  trna genes and pseudogenes  <cit> , while the rat genome contains over  <dig>  trna genes and pseudogenes  <cit> . in dog,  <dig> trna-lysctt genes were predicted, many of which are false positives due to a family of sines specific among carnivore genomes that have evolved from a trna-lysctt  <cit> .

for the accurate identification of trna genes in the mouse genome, putative mouse trna genes predicted by trnascan-se were analyzed using repeatmasker to remove trna-related sines and then cross-validated by identifying orthologous mouse-human trna genes  <cit> . we adopted a similar strategy for the annotation of cow trna genes except that we compared our putative trna genes to a larger set of genomes. while our repeatmasker analysis was able to filter out a large number of false positives , the remaining set of trna genes was still relatively large when compared to numbers observed in other vertebrate genomes. the majority of putative trna genes not identified as repetitive elements were derived from three amino acid families, glutamic acid, glycine and lysine suggesting that these might originate from recent expansion of ruminant-specific trna-derived repeat families. in fact the family of trna-derived sines present among ruminants that was created from a trna-glu  <cit> , may account for many mis-annotated trna genes in the glutamic acid family. these sines have maintained a high level of sequence similarity to authentic trna genes and have trna-like predicted secondary structures . elevated numbers in the glycine and lysine amino acid families are probably due to point mutations in the anticodon region of the trna-related sequence of this trna-glu sine, leading to tcc, ccc, ctt and ttt anticodons, which belong to the glycine and lysine trna gene families.

to help distinguish between well conserved trna-like sequences and functional trna genes we used a comparative genomics approach using trna genes predicted for human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, horse, dog, chicken, and fugu genomes. the fugu genome in particular, provides a good reference as it lacks many of the repetitive elements present in other vertebrate genomes  <cit> . while a number of functional trna genes may be filtered out due to the accumulation of mutations in neutral sites, we wanted to define a confident set of cow trna genes. with a 95% similarity threshold we identified  <dig> different trna genes with  <dig> distinct anticodons, encoding  <dig> trnas with unique sequences. however, this set of  <dig> trna genes was only capable of reading  <dig> of the  <dig> codons. we manually added the respective trna genes for the missing codons, which included  <dig> additional sequences. many of these excluded trna genes were longer than the average  <dig> bp, due to the presence of a variable arm in the trna and as such lowered the sequence similarity score to less than 95%. we performed a cluster analysis of these cow trna genes and explored the relationships between the trna genes to understand more about trna gene evolution in the cow. from our analysis, trna genes with the same anticodon generally formed single clades with high posterior probability support. one exception that we investigated in more detail was trna genes from the glycine family. the vertebrates contain three distinct but related families of trna-gly genes, with tcc, gcc and ccc anticodons. however, in mammals an additional family of trna-glyccc genes is present . this observed trna-glyccc appears to have arisen in the ancestor of the eutherian mammals and marsupials by a mutation in the anticodon of a member of the trna-glygcc family, as this new family was not identified among the non-mammalian genomes we investigated . for the other more conserved subfamily  <dig> trna-glyccc genes it is not clear whether the apparent absence of orthologs of this gene in the current platypus genome assembly is due to the incomplete nature of the assembly, or to loss of the genes in platypus, similarly for the identification of only one member of the family in the cow genome. due to the redundancy of function, and the distinctive sequence differences between the two trna-glyccc families it will be interesting to uncover the expression patterns of trna genes from the glycine family.

while we were able to gain an overview of trna genes within the cow genome, we wanted to trace the evolutionary history of cow trna genes across various organisms. we used phylogenetic profiles as a method to describe the conservation patterns of cow trna genes across  <dig> species. generally, genomes that were phylogenetically more related to the cow genome contained a higher number of trna orthologs. however there was a large distinction in the number of trna orthologs  between vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. the number of cow trna orthologs among vertebrates is 2– <dig> folds larger than the number among invertebrates. expansion of vertebrate genomes resulting in emergence of paralogous copies of trna genes may explain the larger numbers of trna orthologs observed in vertebrates. this is in line with the observation that the number of trna genes in a genome is positively correlated to the genome size  <cit> . however, due to the large evolutionary distance between cow and invertebrates, trna orthologs in invertebrates may have been omitted due to the stringency of our similarity threshold. the phylogenetic profiles also revealed a dispersed distribution of cow trna orthologs. whilst roughly half of the cow trna orthologs are highly conserved and present in all vertebrate genomes the other half display a much more random distribution. this observation is in agreement with the hypothesis of a core and peripheral set of trna genes  <cit> . the authors suggest that trna gene evolution may be a repetitive process, which would explain the distribution of cow trna genes observed in our phylogenetic profiles.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a set of highly conserved trna genes among vertebrate genomes as part of our analysis of the b. taurus genome. our analyses revealed that while most trna isoacceptors seem to have evolved from a common ancestor, some may have different evolutionary histories. our additional analysis of the glycine trna genes revealed two distinct families of trna-glyccc genes, one of which seems to have been formed via a point mutation in the anticodon of a member of the trna-glygcc family just prior to the radiation of mammals. finally, our phylogenetic profiles of cow trna genes shows a large core set of trna genes conserved among vertebrate genomes, which highlights the importance of vertebrate genome expansion in relation to trna gene sets in genomes.
