BACKGROUND
sporothrix schenckii, the etiologic agent of sporotrichosis, is a dimorphic fungus that produces lymphocutaneous lesions  <cit> . pathogenic fungi use signal transduction pathways to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions. studies on the molecular and cellular events during the dimorphic transitions of s. schenckii suggested a role for calcium ions in the control of proliferation and morphogenesis in this fungus  <cit> . studies on the role of calcium metabolism during germ tube formation in s. schenckii yeast cells showed that extracellular calcium ions stimulate the yeast to mycelium transition and that two calcium uptake peaks were detected in cells undergoing transition from the yeast to mycelium forms  <cit> . the first calcium uptake peak occurred during the first  <dig> min after the induction of the yeast to mycelium transition. the second calcium uptake peak was observed  <dig> min after induction, at the time of dna synthesis. when different substances that affected calcium uptake were added to the medium during the yeast to mycelium transition such as cobalt ions, ionophore a <dig> and compound r <dig>  germ tube formation was inhibited or occurred with reduced kinetics  <cit> .

calcium is one of the most important intracellular second messengers, it is involved in a wide range of cellular events including secretion, motility, intermediary metabolism, ion channel activity, and gene expression  <cit> . an increase in intracellular calcium concentration results from any of two events: the release of calcium from internal stores or the increased uptake from the extracellular environment. once the intracellular calcium concentration has increased, calcium exerts its role through a specific class of proteins known as calcium binding proteins. one of the most of important of these proteins is calmodulin   <cit> . among the cam interacting proteins are the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases   <cit> .

the members of the camk family are usually classified based on their substrate specificity into two major groups. the first group has a broad substrate specificity characterized by the ability to phosphorylate many different proteins and includes camks i, ii and iv. within this group, camks i and iv are monomeric enzymes while camk ii is a multimeric enzyme. the second group is characterized by narrow substrate specificity, and includes phosphorylase kinase, myosin light chain kinase and camk iii   <cit> .

calcium/calmodulin kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases. they share many common structural features, having two major domains: an amino-terminal catalytic domain that is highly conserved, and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain. the regulatory domain consists of overlapping autoinhibitory and ca2+/cam binding domains. the autoinhibitory domain acts as a pseudosubstrate, mimicking the substrate and interacting with the catalytic domain, blocking access of the true substrate to the catalytic site  <cit> . the ca2+/cam binding domain is located in the c-terminal portion of the enzyme, consisting of approximately  <dig> amino acids. upon binding of ca2+/calmodulin to a cam-binding domain in the regulatory domain of the camk, a conformational change ensues in which the autoinhibitory domain is removed from the catalytic domain, exposing the active site of the kinase and enabling binding of the substrate and its subsequent phosphorylation  <cit> . activation of camk i and iv is also regulated by phosphorylation by a cam kinase kinase   <cit> .

within this group of multifunctional ca2+/calmodulin kinases, the most studied has been the multimeric camk ii  <cit> . very little has been published concerning camk i  <cit> . this monomeric enzyme is primarily cytoplasmic in mammalian cells and those of many other organisms  <cit> . multiple isoforms of camk i have been identified that have either cytoplasmic and/or nuclear localization. a number of substrates have been identified for camk i including synapsin i and ii, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, myosin ii regulatory light chain kinase, camp response element binding protein , activating transcription factor , histone deacetylases  <dig> and  <dig> and translation initiator factor eif4gii  <cit> .

the role of camks in mammalian systems, particularly in neurons is well established  <cit> , while their occurrence and function in fungi is not fully documented. pausch and colleagues cloned two ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, cmk <dig> and cmk <dig>  from saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . the cmk <dig> gene encodes a product of approximately  <dig> kda. several functions of camks in s. cerevisiae include: survival of pheromone-induced growth arrest, salt tolerance and thermotolerance  <cit> . rasmussen reported the presence of a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in the yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, cmk <dig>  with 40% similarity to the rat and human camk-i  <cit> . in the filamentous fungus aspergillus nidulans, three calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinases, cmka, cmkb, and cmkc, have been reported  <cit> . cmka and cmkb were identified as camks while cmkc was identified as a camkk. the disruption of the cmka and cmkb encoding genes was reported to be lethal  <cit> . in another filamentous fungus, neurospora crassa, a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  was reported by yang and collaborators  <cit> . this protein was 71% similar to ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase a of a. nidulans and 53% similar to camk-ii of s. cerevisiae. tsai, tu and chen described a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in the filamentous fungus, arthrobotrys dactyloides  <cit> . this gene encoded a protein with significant homology to mammalian camks. whole genome sequencing projects show the presence of hypothetical proteins homologous to camk in other fungi, such as magnaporthe grisea and gibberella zeae although the formal identification of these proteins has not been reported in the scientific literature.

even though the importance of calcium signaling in the control of dimorphism in s. schenckii is well documented, the presence of key enzymes involved in calcium signaling in this fungus have not been described  <cit> . the experimental objectives of this work were to establish the presence of a ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in s. schenckii using a pcr homology approach and the characterization of the role of the encoded kinase in s. schenckii dimorphism. we present details of the identification and sequencing of the sscmk <dig> gene, gene organization, including the presence and position of introns, and conserved polypeptide-encoded domains. we establish the relationship of this gene to those of other filamentous fungi using bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses and present evidence for the existence of a well-defined group of cam kinases in the filamentous fungi. we establish the expression of this gene in the yeast and mycelium forms of s. schenckii. we also inquire into the effects of compound w- <dig>  a calmodulin inhibitor, and kn- <dig> and lavendustin c, camk inhibitors, on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle in s. schenckii. this work constitutes the first direct evidence of the presence of a camk encoding gene in s. schenckii and its possible involvement on dimorphism in this fungus. these results suggest that a calcium/calmodulin dependent signaling pathway could be involved in the regulation of dimorphism in this fungus and will ultimately help us elucidate the calcium dependent signal transduction pathways in s. schenckii.

RESULTS
in this study we describe a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in s. schenckii, sscmk <dig>  and the effects of inhibitors of calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin kinases on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle.

identification and characterization of the sscmk <dig> gene
the pcr homology approach was used to identify the presence of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase gene in s. schenckii dna with primers based on conserved motifs of the camk- <dig> gene of n. crassa  <cit> . several sets of primers were tested. a  <dig> bp pcr product was obtained using s. schenckii dna as template with an upper primer comprising nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> and as lower primer the antisense sequence included between nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> in the coding region of the n. crassa camk- <dig> gene. this pcr product contained  <dig> bp of coding sequence and  <dig> bp of a putative intron sequence, and included the sequence from nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  of the s. schenckii ca2+/cam-dependent protein kinase genomic sequence. the derived amino acid sequence of this pcr product was found to be 91% identical to the corresponding region of the n. crassa camk- <dig>  this pcr product was the first evidence of the presence of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase gene in s. schenckii and was named sscmk <dig> 

based on the sequence of the original  <dig> bp pcr product, gene-specific primers and nested gene-specific primers were designed for race as described in methods. the 5' and 3' ends of the sscmk <dig> gene were obtained from two different race reactions each.

pcr reactions were performed to confirm both the genomic and cdna sequences of the sscmk <dig> gene. the genomic dna pcr product was  <dig> bp, showing the presence of an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp interrupted by five introns . the coding sequence in this pcr product confirmed the one obtained using the race technique. the introns had the consensus intron/exon junction splice site, 5'gt/3'ag. the position of the introns in the sscmk <dig> genomic sequence were the following: the first intron had  <dig> bp and included nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> ; the second intron had  <dig> bp and included nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> ; the third intron had  <dig> bp and included nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> ; the fourth intron had  <dig> bp and included nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  and the fifth intron had  <dig> bp and included nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  .

the position of the introns in sscmk <dig> was conserved when compared to those of the introns in the camk- <dig> gene of n. crassa, although the length and the nucleotide sequence of the respective introns were not the same. the first and fourth introns are phase  <dig> introns and were found interrupting codons encoding f <dig> and d <dig>  respectively. the second intron was a phase  <dig> intron and was found interrupting the codon that encoded k <dig>  the third and fifth introns in sscmk <dig> are phase  <dig> introns, interrupting the coding region between the codons encoding r <dig> and d <dig>  g <dig> and d <dig>  respectively.

the cdna coding sequence was obtained using s. schenckii yeast cdna as template. a pcr product of  <dig> bp was obtained, containing a  <dig> bp coding sequence,  <dig> nucleotides of the 5' utr and  <dig> nucleotides of 3' utr after the termination codon prior to the poly a+ tail. the coding sequence was exactly the same as the previous sequence obtained using genomic dna as template, except for the absence of the intron sequences .

in order to determine if this sscmk <dig> gene was transcribed in the mycelium form of the fungus, total rna from the mycelium and yeast forms of the fungus were used to synthesize cdna that was used as template for rt-pcr reactions with the dasqti/wsmgvi primer combination. this set of primers amplified the same region obtained in the original  <dig> bp pcr product without the intron sequence of  <dig> bp. figure  <dig>  shows the expected pcr product of  <dig> bp obtained when using yeast and mycelium cdna as template demonstrating the presence of the sscmk <dig> gene transcript in both forms of the fungus.

bioinformatic sequence characterization
using the panther classification system the sscmk <dig> gene was classified as a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase subfamily   with an e-value of  <dig>  × e- <dig> indicating a very likely correct functional assignment  <cit> . according to the panther ontologies, the molecular function is that of a non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinase and sscmk <dig> is involved in molecular processes involving protein phosphorylation and calcium mediated intracellular signaling.

the putative cam-binding domain was also identified in sscmk <dig> using the calmodulin target database  <cit> . the calmodulin target database search identified the presence of a 1-5-8- <dig> cam-binding motif at residues  <dig> to  <dig>  .

further analysis of the sscmk <dig> gene encoded product showed a pak-box/p21-rho-binding domain. the pfam search identified rho binding repeats at amino acids 97– <dig> and 185– <dig> with e values of  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively.

phylogenetic analysis
effects of cam and camk inhibitors on the yeast to mycelium transition and on the yeast cell cycle
discussion
in this study we describe a calcium/calmodulin kinase gene in s. schenckii, sscmk <dig>  and the effects of inhibitors of the encoded protein on the yeast to mycelium transition and the yeast cell cycle. cam kinases have been extensively recognized as important regulators of morphogenesis and differentiation in many different cell types  <cit> . the present study was conducted in order to establish the presence of this important gene in s. schenckii and the potential involvement of camk on the control of the dimorphism of this fungus using cam and cam kinase inhibitors.

the cam kinase encoded by the sscmk <dig> gene in s. schenckii is homologous to members of the camk group in such diverse organisms as homo sapiens, xenopus, drosophila and definitely fungi as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  our sequence and phylogenetic analyses show a very high degree of conservation of this protein in fungi. in particular, that the camks of the yeast and the filamentous fungi show distinct monophyletic groups.

the derived amino acids sequence of the sscmk <dig> gene encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the number of amino acid residues present in this protein is within the range of other fungal camks, such as:  <dig> amino acids in n. crassa,  <dig> amino acids in a. nidulans and  <dig> amino acids in m. grisea. the calculated molecular weight of the protein encoded by the sscmk <dig> gene product was determined to be  <dig>  kda. this value is also in the range observed for other camks in fungi, such as:  <dig>  kda in n. crassa,  <dig>  kda in m. grisea and  <dig>  kda in a. nidulans.

the analysis of the derived amino acid sequence revealed a calcium/calmodulin kinase containing all the  <dig> conserved subdomains necessary for a functional serine/threonine protein kinase  <cit> , and identified a serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain. the nine amino acids shown to be strictly conserved in the catalytic domain of protein kinases were found in the corresponding region of sscmk <dig>  an additional five residues also conserved in all protein kinases were found in the corresponding region of sscmk <dig>  all these residues are highlighted in red in figure  <dig>  the panther protein and gene classification system showed an extremely significant expectation value for sscmk <dig> being a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  <cit> .

a putative cam-binding domain  was also identified in sscmk <dig> using the calmodulin target database search  <cit> . the cam-binding domain is characterized by a high proportion of basic amino acid residues, not highly conserved at the level of primary structure, but conserved at the level of secondary structure  <cit> . this motif is of the same type as that found in cam kinases of a. nidulans and s. cerevisiae, among others.

in addition to the serine protein kinase domain, the sscmk <dig> gene encoded product showed a pak-box/p21-rho-binding domain. the rho, rac and cdc <dig> are small gtpases that are involved in a variety of different fuctions such as bud emergence, actin polymerization, differentiation, protein transport and many other cellular events  <cit> . many kinases have been shown to contain this motif and it has been reported that these protein kinases might be stimulated by the small gtpases  <cit> . proteins with this domain are usually involved in the regulation of the mapk pathway and this cascade has important relevance in the control of morphogenetic and proliferative processes.

due to the fact that s. schenckii is not a genetically manageable organism, our approach to the study of the involvement of camk activity in dimorphism was based on the use of substances that affect camk activity. it is of interest to note that we used three different compounds w- <dig>  kn- <dig> and lavendustin c, that will inhibit the camk pathway with different mechanism of action in order to lessen the uncertainties of using inhibitors that have different degrees of specificity towards camks. kn- <dig> is the most specific inhibitor of the three, inhibiting the cam binding site in camks  <cit> . lavendustin c is preferentially a camk inhibitor but has been reported to also inhibit tyrosine kinases  <cit> . compound w- <dig> would be expected to inhibit camk and other cam dependent proteins because it is a calmodulin inhibitor  <cit> . even though there might be some considerations in terms of the specificity of these last two compounds, w- <dig> and lavendustin c, we have used kn- <dig> which is considered a very specific inhibitor of camks.

given the above, it is most important to note that the final outcomes in the presence of these inhibitors observed by us were the same regardless of the inhibitor used: 1) stimulation of the yeast to mycelium transition, and 2) inhibition of the re-entry into the yeast cell cycle. nevertheless we have to keep in mind that the full scope of the processes inhibited by w- <dig> and lavendustin c are not presently known.

the inhibition observed on yeast cells induced to re-enter the budding cycle suggests that cam and/or cam kinase activity are required for the re-entry of yeast cells into this cycle. the controls had 50% budding cells after  <dig> h of incubation while those in the presence of w- <dig>  kn- <dig> or lavendustin c had only  <dig>   <dig> and 38%, respectively. at  <dig> h of incubation the control cells undergo dna synthesis and bud formation that results in cell duplication after  <dig> h of incubation  <cit> . the inhibition was observed at  <dig> h of incubation, specifically at the time of the g1/s transition. s. schenckii yeast cells will not form buds if dna synthesis is inhibited  <cit> . we therefore believe that cam kinase activity is probably needed for the g1/s transition during the budding cycle as has been reported for other systems as well  <cit> .

on the other hand, these inhibitors stimulated the yeast to mycelium transition at  <dig> and  <dig> h of incubation. it is at  <dig> h after inoculation that control cells induced to transform to the mycelium form of the fungus first show germ tubes, after they have undergone dna synthesis and the first nuclear division, a prerequisite for germ tube formation in this fungus  <cit> . it is not until  <dig> h after inoculation that all control cells exhibit germ tubes. the process of germ tube formation in the presence of kn- <dig> and lavendustin c occurred with increased kinetics, and germination was well advanced at  <dig> h after inoculation. compound w- <dig> was observed to increase germ tube formation significantly only at  <dig> h after inoculation.

two mechanisms have been postulated for the effects of cam and cam kinases in many systems including fungi, one suggests that these enzymes have an effect in the control of the cell cycle  <cit>  and the other suggests that they have an important role in differentiation and gene expression, specifically through the activation of transcription factors  <cit> . at this moment we do not have the exact mechanism by which cam and/or cam kinase act in s. schenckii. a unified theory on how cam kinases operate in fungi is presently not available, primarily because the targets of these enzymes are not known and contradictory results have been reported in fungi where the activity of these enzymes have been studied. in a. nidulans, camk is an essential gene, required for cell cycle progression  <cit> . in this fungus, knocking out the camk gene has been reported to be lethal and over-expression of the gene has been reported to be inhibitory of spore germination and growth in this fungus  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, camk and calcineurin are not required for cell proliferation, nevertheless, they are required for survival of pheromone-induced growth arrest and for ion homeostasis  <cit> . in c. albicans cam inhibitors were observed to suppress hyphae formation  <cit>  while in paracocciodiodis brasiliensis, cam inhibitors were reported to inhibit the mycelium to yeast transition  <cit> . these results show that the role of camks differ among fungal species.

our results using camk inhibitors suggest that this enzyme is needed for proliferation of the yeast cells when induced to re-enter the cell cycle and is needed for the maintenance of the yeast morphology in s. schenckii. we could hypothesize that cam kinase is needed for the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and also for the phosphorylation and inactivation of transcription factors needed for the transition to the mycelium form of the fungus, as has been postulated for a. nidulans  <cit> . nevertheless, the final interpretation of these results and those of the yeast to mycelium transition await the identification of the interacting partners of cam and cam kinases in this fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
the information summarized in this work shows once more the complexity of the involvement of protein kinases, regulated by intracellular levels of calcium ions in the control of dimorphism in s. schenckii. in this work a calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase gene, sscmk <dig>  was identified and characterized. messenger rna for this gene was detected in both yeast and mycelium forms of s. schenckii. we had previously identified a role for protein kinase c in the regulation of dimorphism in s. schenckii but had not identified either the presence or the role of camks in this fungus. calcium/calmodulin kinases are known to be effectors of the calcium signal in other systems but no information as to the existence and nature of these enzymes was available in s. schenckii until now.

the cdna sequence of the sscmk <dig> gene revealed an orf of  <dig> bp with the predicted amino acid sequence containing all the consensus domains present in other serine/threonine protein kinases as well as a putative cam-binding domain. the genomic sequence had five introns, whose positions are conserved in the other fungal calcium/calmodulin kinases.

the encoded protein has  <dig> amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately  <dig>  kda. protein domain analysis of sscmk <dig> identified the presence of a serine/threonine catalytic domain, protein kinase atp binding region, a serine/threonine protein kinase active site, and a calmodulin binding site.

most important of all, cam and camk inhibitors were found to favor the yeast to mycelium transition and to inhibit the re-entry into the budding cycle by yeast cells in s. schenckii suggesting a role for calmodulin kinase in the expression of the yeast morphology of the fungus.
