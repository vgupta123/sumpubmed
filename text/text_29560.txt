BACKGROUND
continuous improvement of biotechnologies, progress of massive sequencing techniques and development of new technologies for high-throughput analysis and annotation of biomolecular sequences are generating a huge amount of biomolecular data and knowledge. yet, the very valuable controlled biomolecular annotation data  are far from exhaustive.

to extract information and knowledge from available data, several approaches have been proposed. a literature-based knowledge discovery model has been first proposed by swanson to identify implicit connections between terms that do not occur together in any scientific document  <cit> . corpus-derived statistical models of semantic distance, such as latent semantic analysis , have been evaluated as methods for the discovery of these implicit connections  <cit> . other computational methods based on singular value decomposition  of gene or protein annotation matrices have been developed to predict annotations  <cit> . several approaches for link prediction in networks have been proposed  <cit> ; mostly based on similarity algorithms and maximum likelihood or probabilistic models, they have been applied and evaluated mainly on social networks  <cit> , but also in biology, particularly on protein-protein interaction data  <cit> . the use of decision trees and bayesian networks for predicting annotations by learning patterns from available annotation profiles has been suggested as well  <cit> . simpler yet effective logic rule techniques, such as the one based on transitive relationships  <cit> , have been also proposed, in particular for their application to database relations  <cit> . yet, huge efforts keep being performed to solve this issue and try to provide new biomolecular annotations reliably identified, which can complement the available ones and support uncovering new biomedical knowledge. towards this aim, leveraging a high quality integration of available multiple heterogeneous, but consistent, information helps greatly.

previously, we developed the genomic and proteomic knowledge base   <cit> , an updated public, high-quality and consistent integration of reconciled heterogeneous and distributed annotation and interaction data; it can be profitably leveraged to help unveiling new biomedical knowledge by reliably identifying and supplementing missing annotations based on available ones. here, we present and discuss our work aimed at 1) developing an efficient and automatic procedure to be routinely applied on new releases of the gpkb in order to detect consistent and trustworthy biomolecular annotations which are not present in the available data integrated, and 2) supplementing and providing them publicly, together with the available annotation and interaction data integrated in the gpkb, in support of biomedical knowledge discovery applications.

the data warehousing integration approach that we applied to build the gpkb allows performing thorough data quality and consistency checking  <cit> , as well as reconciliation of unsynchronized data, in order to integrate only high quality consistent data  <cit> ; both these aspects are paramount to subsequently use the integrated data for reliable comprehensive detection and supplement of missing biomolecular annotations. furthermore, we drastically reduced warehousing maintenance overhead by using automatic procedures, which regularly update easily the data in the gpkb, and by adopting a novel, modular and multilevel feature-based global data schema  <cit> ; besides easing data warehousing updates and extensions, it also ensures provenance tracking of all the integrated data, which is paramount for their proper subsequent processing and the interpretation of processing results.

our developed annotation identification approach is inspired by the swanson work  <cit> , but founded on the transitive relationship logic rule  <cit> ; in fact, it leverages the transitive relationships of heterogeneous extensive annotation data. thus, it does not use a predictive model or provide predictions, but rather it detects and supplements annotations that should exist based on the available data. the applied concept is also close to the linked open data approach of the semantic web  <cit> , which has been recently used to link various sources of drug data in order to answer interesting scientific and business questions  <cit> . yet, we enriched it with a set of novel rules that strengthen our approach and ensure its application only when the semantic type of the considered data and the semantic type and cardinality of their relationships allow identifying molecular biology compliant associations . this enhances the reliability of the detected annotations, which is further increased by the several procedures that we defined to avoid propagation, through automatic data processing, of errors existing in public biomolecular data, including in those that our method uses. the application of our approach to the high quality, consistent and reconciled data integrated in the gpkb allowed detecting and supplementing many missing new biomolecular annotations, "transferring" them from available ones. validation of the transferred annotations showed their high reliability, which makes them suitable to be used for data-driven biomedical knowledge discoveries.

RESULTS
transitive relationship approach for biomolecular annotations
we implemented a general and customizable software framework to automatically detect missing biomolecular annotations and "transfer" them from available ones by transitive relationships based on available annotations, as defined in the methods section and additional file  <dig>  it can be used with any biomolecular database that stores annotation data to perform the transitive relationship approach on large annotation data sets efficiently and effectively. furthermore, it can automatically detect any meaningful semantic annotation, according to the defined set of novel rules illustrated in the transitive relationship approach and its defined rules section of the methods and to additional specific data attributes available; these last can be useful, for example, to maximize correctness and quality of the identified annotations, as discussed in the methods in the control of error propagation during transitive relationship automatic approach section.

we focused mainly on transitive relationships with path of length two and used the developed software framework to detect and supplement missing new biomolecular annotations, according to the numerous gene and protein annotation and interaction data integrated in our gpkb . such data define a valuable network of many types of biomolecular entities, biomedical-molecular characteristics and their relationships. figure  <dig> describes, at conceptual level, this network, which can be profitably leveraged by the transitive relationship method in order to discover and supplement missing annotations, transferring them from available ones. in figure  <dig>  each node of the network indicates a type of feature  whose data are in the gpkb; it represents a database table containing all instances of that feature  in the gpkb. similarly, each arc of the network indicates a relationship between the two connected features, defined by the annotation data in the gpkb; it represents a database feature association table that contains all the associations in the gpkb between the two connected features , which can be of a single or multiple semantic types. 

biological functions
depending on semantics of features and their associations, and on cardinality of associations, only some feature associations can be straightforwardly identified and transferred by transitive relationship based on available association data; we expressed these constrains in a set of novel rules described in the transitive relationship approach and its defined rules section of the methods. here as follows, only as brief trivial explanatory example, we describe, in term of biological entities and annotations, which associations can be identified and transferred by transitive relationship and which not.

if a protein p <dig> , or any of its isoforms) is annotated to a biological function b <dig> , then also the gene g <dig> ), which encodes the protein p <dig> and its isoforms, should be annotated to the biological function b <dig>  if such annotation of gene g <dig> to the biological function b <dig> is not available, but the annotations of p <dig> to b <dig> and g <dig> to p <dig> are available, then the annotation of g <dig> to b <dig> can be straightforwardly detected as missing and transferred by transitive relationship, with path of length two, based on available annotation data. whereas, if both gene g <dig> and protein p <dig> are annotated to the same biological function b <dig>  it does not imply that gene g <dig> should encode protein p <dig>  given the possible multiple cardinality of annotation of unrelated genes and proteins to the same biological function. as well, if gene g <dig> encodes protein p <dig> and is annotated to biological function b <dig> , it does not straightforwardly imply that protein p <dig> should be annotated to biological function b2; in fact, by alternative splicing, gene g <dig> could encode multiple proteins  with different biological functions. we note that this last is a conservative rule for annotation transfer . we adopt this rule to take well into account the underlying molecular biology and avoid annotation automatic transfers that might generate false positive annotations, despite losing possible correct ones. in figure  <dig>  there are represented the types of gene annotations  that we detected as missing and transferred by transitive relationship based on the types of protein annotations available in the gpkb . although transitive relationships need directed links, figure  <dig> does not show directed arcs since it represents not only the annotations used for the transitive relationship method, but the entire gpkb feature network previously mentioned, which includes all the annotations, of various semantic types, integrated in the gpkb.

percentages of annotations transferred are with respect to annotations of the same type available in the gpkb; all: only annotations transferred, no annotations available in the gpkb.

several  of the transferred gene to pathway annotations involve reactome pathways, although such transferred annotations concern only human genes . despite reactome provides pathway annotations for both proteins and genes, inconsistencies and not complete correspondences exist between such gene and protein annotations, which our approach detected and  completed; we reported them to the reactome curators, who ensured to fix them in the next release of their data. also  <dig>   gene to kegg pathway annotations were transferred, but for  <dig> organisms; most of these annotations, as well as of the transferred gene to biological function annotations, regards less studied organisms. they do not just fill gaps between databases, but represent new discovered gene annotations, which are transferred thanks to the protein similarity data integrated in the gpkb  <cit>  and their use by the transitive relationship method .

by leveraging gene associated disorder data from the omim database, we also identified possible candidate protein annotations to human genetic disorders . to our knowledge, these annotations are not available in public databases. furthermore, by taking advantage also of protein-protein interaction  data integrated in the gpkb from the intact database, we identified interacting proteins possibly associated with the same genetic disorder; in so doing, we detected  <dig>  potential candidate associations of  <dig> genetic disorders with  <dig> human ppis. all these are to be intended as proteins and ppis candidate associated with genetic disorders, which are suggested for further association studies.

evaluation of the transitive relationship approach for biomolecular annotations
differently from other proposed methods  <cit> , which are based on predictive models and provide probabilistic predictions, the simple, yet effective, transitive relationship approach is based on logic rules  <cit> . thus, it does not provide predictions; rather it gives discrete answers  in detecting and transferring those biomolecular annotations that should exist based on the available data. classical model validation methods  curves) are suitable to validate probabilistic but not discrete results  <cit> , which are represented by a single point in the roc space. accuracy of the discrete results provided by the transitive relationship approach only depends on completeness and correctness of available data on which the approach is applied. for this reason we applied it on the numerous high quality reconciled data integrated in the gpkb, which can ensure better detection and supplement of missing biomolecular annotations.

to evaluate the transitive relationship approach, we estimated its recall  and precision ; we did so by comparing the gene annotations in the gpkb with the gene annotations that the approach identifies that should exist and can transfer based only on the protein annotation and protein encoding gene data available in the gpkb.  overall, we obtained a recall of  <dig>  % . the missed identification of some available gene annotations was mainly due to no availability of the corresponding protein annotations, or of data about the genes encoding the annotated proteins. lower recall for biological function annotations was mainly due to the numerous of these annotations that are available as computationally derived only, both for genes and proteins; thus, they are available but our method does not considered them for annotation transfer to avoid possible automatic error propagation .

as estimate of method precision, overall we found that  <dig>  % of the gene annotations that the transitive relationship method identified were already available in the gpkb . yet, as the available annotations are incomplete by definition, in particular for the many less studied organisms considered, these good figures can only represent a possible approximation of the method precision and not its correct estimate.

assessment of transferred biomolecular annotations
as discussed in the previous section, classical validation methods cannot be used to assess the transitive relationship method results. thus, to better evaluate their correctness, we performed an overall co-functional evaluation of all genes involved in the transferred and known gene pathway annotations, as well as in known and transferred biological functions. in addition, we performed a supervised in silico validation and biological interpretation of some annotations transferred in some selected biological examples. we performed the latter one by consulting the literature and several well-known databases and by taking advantage of the evidence, based on the available data, that our implemented approach provides; in fact, it keeps track and offers full characterization and provenance of all features and their associations involved in each of the new annotations transferred .

co-functional assessment of genes with transferred and known pathway and biological function annotations. by performing the co-functional evaluation of these genes as described in the methods section, we obtained the results illustrated in figure  <dig>  the simple idea behind this global co-functional evaluation is that a pathway annotation is correctly transferred to a gene if the gene has biological function  annotations similar to the go annotations of the genes already known to be annotated to the same pathway. the transferred pathway annotations of genes with known go functional annotations resulted to be  <dig>  % of all gene pathway annotations transferred. about  <dig>  % of them regards genes whose most specific  go annotation shared with the genes known to be involved to the same pathway has maximum level , in the go hierarchy, higher than level  <dig>  i.e. it is quite or very specific . also on average the shared lowest common go functional annotations are rather specific; in  <dig>  % of the gene pathway annotations transferred their average go level  is higher than level  <dig> 

most important, these percentages are very similar to the equivalent ones obtained for the known pathway annotations of genes known to share go functional annotations with other genes known to be involved in the same pathway. for  <dig>  % of them, maxlgj is higher than go level  <dig>  while for  <dig>  % of them avglgj is higher than go level  <dig> . although these known gene pathway annotations, which regard genes with known go annotations, are a higher percentage, out of all known pathway annotations available, with respect to the percentage of transferred gene pathway annotations , this is expected. to a certain extent, pathway and go functional annotations are related; thus, it is expected that genes with known pathway annotations have more known go annotations. by considering not only the known go annotations but also the ones that we transferred by transitive relationship, the percentage of pathway annotations transferred to genes with go annotations raises from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. furthermore, the distributions of maxlgi and avglgi enhance, with increased values for high go levels , while the distributions of maxlgj and avglgj values remain similar . conversely, for the known pathway annotations of genes known to share go functional annotations with other genes known to be involved in the same pathway, all these values practically do not change by considering also the go annotations that we transferred by transitive relationship.

these results clearly show that, in the great majority of the pathway annotations transferred to genes, the annotated gene has function very similar to that of at least one of the genes known to be involved in that same pathway, and also similar on average to the functions of all those genes. most of all, such considerations can be equally applied to the genes already known to be annotated to the same pathway. furthermore, a relevant part of the residual gene pathway annotations transferred which seam without functional evidence are due to the incompleteness of the available gene functional annotations. in fact, by considering also the new gene functional annotations transferred through the transitive relationship method, this residual percentage of transferred gene pathway annotations lowers to more than half , which is closer to the one of the known gene pathway annotations available . this also shows the relevance and reliability of the transferred gene to biological function annotations.

example of relevant annotation transferred by transitive relationship. as an example of the ability of our, although simple, transitive relationship based method to discover non-trivial gene annotations, we report the detection of the new annotation of the insulin-like growth factor  <dig>   human gene to the go insulin-like growth factor binding molecular function. it is transferred from the same annotation " evidence) of the swiss-prot reviewed human putative insulin-like growth factor 2-associated protein . in major databases this protein is not defined as encoded by the igf <dig> human gene, which results encoding the insulin-like growth factor ii  protein and its isoforms. such isoforms do not include the ig2r_human protein, although since  <dig> a paper describes it as one of the alternative splicing forms encoded by the igf <dig> human gene  <cit> . correctness of the new annotation is also supported by, and in agreement with, other go annotations already available for the igf <dig> human gene . in particular, it is not contradictory with the insulin like growth factor receptor binding annotation known for the igf <dig> human gene; in fact, the igf <dig> human gene encodes both the two alternative splicing forms above mentioned  <cit> , which have different binding affinity within the igf signaling regulatory system. the detection of this non-trivial gene annotation  leverages the power not only of the transitive relationship method, but also of the protein similarity data integrated in the gpkb  <cit> . in fact, these data include the association of the ig2r_human protein  with the aal <dig> and aay <dig> embl/genbank protein ids, which are also associated with the igf <dig> human gene; thus, they transitively associate the ig2r_human protein with the igf <dig> human gene as another of its encoded isoforms . the subsequent application of the transitive relationship method to such unveiled encodes relationships and the annotated to relationships between the ig2r_human protein and its go annotations allows identifying and transfer the insulin-like growth factor binding as a new go annotation for the igf <dig> human gene .

assessment of ppi-genetic disorder candidate associations. unfortunately, it is not possible performing a global evaluation also for the identified candidate associations between ppis and genetic disorders; in fact, no information to globally compare them with is available, although a few papers exist about the involvement of disrupted ppis in the onset and development of some genetic disorders . thus, our final validation could regard only some of the  <dig>  potential associations detected between  <dig> human ppis and  <dig> major genetic disorders . among these latter ones, we focused on the long studied cystic fibrosis, one of the common inherited diseases in humans; we found strong evidence in the literature that supports six out of the seven identified candidate associations of cystic fibrosis with the ppis illustrated in figure  <dig>  in fact, those ppis include the interactions of the cftr_human protein with the four derl1_human, rnf5_human, ahsa1_human and gopc_human proteins, as well as the interactions of the chip_human protein with the hsp7c_human and clcn2_human proteins. mutations of the encoding genes of all these proteins, in particular of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  human gene, as well as of many other genes , are individually known to be directly involved in different grades and manifestations of cystic fibrosis, which arises from misfolding and premature degradation of mutated cftr forms. in addition, younger et al.  <cit>  discovered an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase complex that cooperates with the cytosolic hsp7c / chip e <dig> complex and contains interacting protein products of the derl <dig> and rnf <dig> genes, which cooperate to triage variants of the cftr protein in order to monitor their folding status and promote proteasomal degradation. in  <dig>  wang and colleagues  <cit>  observed that the down-regulation of human hsp <dig> cochaperone aha <dig>  rescues misfolding of cftr protein in cystic fibrosis. lately, they characterized the molecular and structural basis of the mechanisms responsible for such regulation  <cit> , thus providing a potential key to understanding the role of hsp <dig> in folding of cftr and progression of cystic fibrosis disease. more recently, pelaseyed and hansson  <cit>  elucidated the modulated down-expression of cftr through over-expression of gopc, which directs cftr for degradation. all these works support and provide evidence for six of the candidate associations identified between cystic fibrosis and the six ppis mentioned. we could not find clear supporting evidence only for the identified candidate association of cystic fibrosis with the ppi between the chip_human and clcn2_human proteins, although also the latter protein is known to be associated with cystic fibrosis, since it is over-expressed in epithelia affected by cystic fibrosis  <cit> .

all the identified candidate associations could suggest that some types of the cystic fibrosis multi-variant disorder may be associated with defects in the interactions between these proteins. in the review  <cit> , zanzoni et al. previously reported that gene mutations may alter the interaction properties of the encoded proteins, disrupting the interaction interface and leading to loss of function and disorders. they also suggested that ppis could represent a class of targetable entities for novel therapeutic strategies. possibly, in cystic fibrosis different mutations could alter the functional interaction of the cftr_human protein with the derl1_human, rnf5_human, ahsa1_human and gopc_human proteins, or between the chip_human and hsp7c_human or clcn2_human proteins. if this would be experimentally confirmed, such finding could also suggest, as a possible disease treatment strategy, the engineering of a synthetic protein interacting, e.g., with the mutated cftr_human protein and similar in function to the derl1_human, rnf5_human, ahsa1_human or gopc_human protein, whose interaction with the mutated cftr_human protein results altered. at the time of writing, to our knowledge, such associations of cystic fibrosis with the mentioned ppis were not reported in any public database or explicitly in the literature; making them available in the gpkb represents an important advance.

discussion
obtained results clearly show that the simple, yet effective, transitive relationship technique  <cit>  can be originally applied to discover gene annotations from data structured in a large biomedical-molecular database, such as the gpkb. our implementation, optimized for its off-line use, allows obtaining results in reasonable time, also when it is applied on huge amounts of genomic and proteomic data. furthermore, when it is required, it can be further accelerated by using it in a distributed and parallel way on partitioned data. we are not aware of any large biomolecular database that currently implements such transitive relationship procedure, which produces results of great benefit to the community, as we showed.

the major issue in the use of the transitive relationship approach is in the possible propagation of errors, i.e. the generation of wrong results due to incorrectness of the considered data or of their semantic types. being very conscious of this aspect, we implemented numerous mechanisms to avoid wrong results; during both gpkb construction and transitive relationship processing, these mechanisms exclude data items that must not be taken into account, or of low quality. in particular, we leveraged our previous efforts in the identification of errors and inconsistencies in public databases  <cit>  by taking maximum care in avoiding error propagation through erroneous transitive relationships due to asynchronisms, inconsistencies, or errors in the considered data  <cit> . whenever possible, we identified inconsistencies, reconciled asynchronisms and excluded erroneous data from the transitive relationship approach, as described in the methods section. furthermore, we adopted several precautions to ensure biological significance of results. firstly, we considered only transitive relationships with path of length two, avoiding full transitive closure. secondly, we focused only on biomedical-molecular relationships whose semantic type and cardinality allow straightforward transitive relationships, as formalized in a set of novel rules that we defined in the methods section. the only exception was the identification of ppis candidate associated with genetic disorders, which is based on the available association data between genetic disorders and genes encoding the interacting proteins. in this case, only potential candidate associations can be detected, since for alternative splicing a gene can encode multiple proteins with different characteristics. nonetheless, given the high relevance of such candidate associations, which presently to our knowledge are not available in any public database, we decided to detect them anyway, although knowing that the results could include errors and that there is a long way from associating interacting proteins to a single disease and the disruption of their interaction to this disease. however, we could find strong supporting evidence in the literature for the few detected candidate associations that we validated, i.e. the ones detected between cystic fibrosis and human ppis.

validation of results obtained through the implemented method demonstrated that the transitive relationship approach, applied on the numerous and heterogeneous annotation data integrated in the gpkb, can clearly detect and supplement missing gene annotations which are already implicitly known as annotations of the gene encoded proteins; in so doing, not only it fills gaps and fixes inconsistencies among different data sources, but also it makes explicit relevant information useful for computational analyses. furthermore and much more significantly, it can also reliably identify and supplement substantial novel gene annotations, as shown in a non-trivial example in the results section; this is possible mainly thanks to the data quality checking and integration procedures performed during the gpkb construction and the historical and similarity data integrated in the gpkb  <cit> .

despite the gpkb integrates all data publicly available on the ftp sites of the reference entrez gene and goa databases, as well as of some relevant gene pathway databases , by using the transitive relationship approach we could detect and transfer numerous gene pathway and biological function  annotations not included in these databases. co-functional evaluation of genes with transferred and known annotation to the same pathway, demonstrated overall reliability of the transferred gene pathway, as well as biological function, annotations.

all obtained results demonstrate the usefulness of our approach in reliably identifying new annotations, as well as in complementing the ones provided by individual databases. this is particularly relevant for the gene annotations to characteristics of their encoded proteins, which are still limitedly provided by on-line available databases. indeed, gene annotations are very important, in particular for the interpretation of routinely performed transcriptomic analyses; the great majority of the many tools available for functional enrichment analysis of gene expression results directly relies on the available gene annotations  <cit> . improvement of such gene annotations in quantity, coverage and quality is paramount to obtain better gene functional analysis results. our approach and its application to any new release of the gpkb provide a relevant contribution towards this aim.

public availability in the gpkb of all new annotations detected complements our work in the construction of the gpkb as an updated integrated collection of relevant biomedical-molecular data sparsely available. it makes the gpkb an even more valuable data source for integrated bio-searches on several types of annotation data, aimed at answering complex biomedical questions that can lead to biomedical knowledge discovery, as we showed in  <cit> . furthermore, the provenance tracking implemented in gpkb allows users to exactly know the origin of each data integrated in the gpkb, as well as of all the annotations detect by transitive relationship and the data used for their detection. this enables each user to independently assess quality and confidence in the data, as well as to select and use only those data that he/she considers more reliable.

in the next scheduled release of the gpkb, besides the detected gene annotations and ppi-genetic disorder potential candidate associations, we plan to include also transcript annotations identified based on available annotations of the proteins that the transcripts encode. subsequently, we intend to enrich the gpkb also with dna sequence annotations detected on the basis of available annotations of genes and proteins encoded by the dna sequences. presently, both dna sequence and transcript annotations are not directly available in any public database, forcing the researchers interested on them to tedious and error prone conversions from available gene and protein annotations. their public availability would ease and improve biomedical interpretation of different types of high-throughput biomolecular experimental results, including those that are recently obtaining with dna-seq and rna-seq next generation sequencing techniques.

CONCLUSIONS
biomolecular annotations can be efficiently and effectively detected in silico by leveraging integrated data from multiple databases through a transitive relationship based approach. the detected annotations require biological validation; yet, this approach intrinsically provides their in silico evidence based on the available data. evaluation of obtained results demonstrated that this approach can correctly detect with good precision not only annotations that are already present in some databases on which the transitive relationship approach is not based, but also new valuable annotations not yet included in any database. in the former case, the same annotations available in some database validate the detected ones; in the latter case, we evaluated some of the new identified annotations and found relevant scientific papers that support them. their public availability can improve bioinformatics analyses that are carried out by using available biomedical-molecular annotations. their storage in the gpkb, together with the available annotations there integrated, allows leveraging the gpkb to perform integrated bio-searches, which may foster data-driven discoveries that can help unveiling new biomedical-molecular knowledge.
