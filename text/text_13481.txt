BACKGROUND
fruit ripening is a complex process that involves the coordinated regulation of many metabolic pathways which influence numerous traits such as colour, aroma and flavour. during ripening, softening of the fruit tissues occurs in parallel with the accumulation of sugars, acids, and volatile compounds. together, these traits contribute to increased palatability. other characters, such as colour, size, and maturity date, have been selected to offer products with improved consumer appreciation. for practical reasons, fruits are harvested before they are physiologically ripe and are thus often perceived by the consumer as of poor quality. consequently, the ideotype pursued by modern peach breeding is characterized by an increase of fruit quality associated to an easy harvest , in order to reach optimal fruit quality at consumption. fruit maturity is an important trait and early fruit ripening could allow market growth by extending the length of the production season. studies in a wide range of plant species have provided insights into the genetic mechanisms that mediate fruit ripening-related processes, such as pigment synthesis, cell wall and sugar metabolism  <cit> .

climacteric fruits such as peach are characterized by an increase in respiration and an autocatalytic burst of ethylene production late in fruit development which is essential for normal fruit ripening. blocking ethylene synthesis or perception prevents ripening  <cit> . some tomato mutants  are unable to ripen even when treated with exogenous ethylene, although not impaired in the hormone signal transduction pathway  <cit> ; and references therein]. molecular analyses of these mutants and identification of the corresponding genes indicate that they are necessary for the expression of both ethylene-dependent and -independent genes during ripening, acting upstream of and possibly in parallel to ethylene  <cit> . in banana, another climacteric fruit, nac transcription factors have been shown to physically interact with a downstream component of ethylene signaling, ethylene insensitive  <dig> -like protein, which was down-regulated during ripening  <cit> . thus, the control of nac tfs on ripening is important as that regulated by the hormone.

in peach, qtls controlling md have been mapped on different chromosomes, with major qtls located on linkage group   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . by analyzing the contender x ambra  f <dig> population we have shown that the qtl detected on lg <dig> behaves as a mendelian trait and has pleiotropic effects masking the effects of qtls for different fruit traits  <cit> . in the present work we refer to this locus as qmd <dig> . recently, a major qtl was also identified in the collinear region of apricot  and sweet cherry  suggesting that a common mechanism may control fruit maturation in related prunus species  <cit> .

in the present study, qmd <dig>  was genetically dissected to gain insight into the mechanisms controlling md in peach and to better understand the genetic interactions of this locus with other fruit traits. to this end, a fine map of the qmd <dig>  locus was constructed, increasing the number of markers and individuals in the cxa population and analyzing another f <dig> population where md is segregating as a mendelian trait. analysis of the region located candidate genes for the md qtl and a scan of publicly available re-sequencing data for the cxa f <dig> parent identified polymorphisms in the region harbouring qmd <dig>  <cit> . a sequence variant in a nac candidate gene was shown to co-segregate with the md trait in these two populations and can be used in selection for early/late maturity genotypes.

RESULTS
fine mapping of the qmd <dig>  locus
the objective of this study was to fine map qmd <dig> , the md locus described by eduardo et al.  <cit>  on lg <dig> of the cxa f <dig> population. this locus had been mapped using  <dig> individuals and a genetic map comprising  <dig> ssrs and two phenotypic markers, with flanking markers m12a and eppisf <dig> defining a  <dig>  cm interval, corresponding to  <dig>  mb on the peach reference genome. in order to fine map qmd <dig> , the number of individuals of this population was increased to  <dig> and  <dig> snps were added around and into the original map interval. the snps were manually selected from the publicly available genome re-sequencing data of the cxa f <dig> self-pollinated parent . in parallel, we also analysed another f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals derived from the cross between pi <dig>  and bounty , also segregating for md and genotyped with the 9k snp peach array v <dig>  <cit>  .

in both populations md showed a trimodal distribution  and very high correlation between years  . this distribution suggested a mendelian behaviour. thus, a genome-wide qtl analysis for md was carried out for confirmation using both populations independently, with the purpose of excluding the possible segregation of other md qtls . although segregating as a mendelian trait in both the cxa and the wxby f <dig> populations, md behaves as a quantitative trait in other populations such as the f <dig> population derived from the cross between bolero and oroa  <cit> .

figureÂ  <dig> shows the region where qmd <dig>  is located in both maps, cxa and wxby, as compared to the data from eduardo et al.  <cit> . in both maps high segregation distortion was observed in the target region . the analysis of the alleles showed that under-represented alleles came from the c genome in cxa and from w genome in wxby, in both cases corresponding to the late ripening allele.

the highest lod and percentage of phenotypic variation are indicated in bold with the nearest marker. positions are indicated in cm .  markers from eduardo et al.  <cit> ,  newly developed markers,  markers from verde et al.  <cit> . significance levels of locus-genotype frequencies: *: <dig>  **: <dig>  ***: <dig>  ****: <dig>  *****: <dig>  ******: <dig>  *******: <dig> .

to define the target region for candidate gene analysis and to anchor the two maps we used the sequenom platform to genotype the cxa f <dig> progeny for  <dig> snps that were also included in the 9k snp peach array v <dig> .

considering the region between the anchor markers snp_iga_ <dig> and snp_iga_ <dig> present in both populations, in the cxa map, the region spans  <dig>  cm and includes  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> snps, whereas in the wxby fine map this region includes  <dig> snps and spans  <dig>  cm. the full map from wxby will be described elsewhere and was used here to run a qtl analysis for the md trait, showing no other qtl for md segregating in this population . fine mapping analysis showed that in cxa, qmd <dig>  is localized in a window of  <dig>  cm between the markers ptp <dig> and ptp <dig> spanning the chromosome region between  <dig> - <dig>  mb, whereas in the wxby map qmd <dig>  is located in a window of  <dig>  cm between markers snp_iga_ <dig> and snp_iga_ <dig> spanning the chromosome region between  <dig> - <dig>  mb . moreover, in the cxa progeny lod score in qmd <dig>  region reaches a value of more than  <dig>  while in wxby lod score is about  <dig> with more than 90% of explained variance . therefore this is the region where we focused the search for candidate genes.

although the cxa f <dig> population has a higher number of individuals, the wxby f <dig> population has a higher number of segregating genotyped markers, which provided a better resolution in the mapping of qmd <dig>  . these results showed the utility of the new genomic tools, such as the 9k snp peach array v <dig>  <cit> , to improve the efficiency and resolution in peach mapping studies. in addition, the use of the wxby f <dig> population allowed us to identify a relatively small region harbouring a limited number of candidate genes compared to the cxa f <dig> population .

qtls for md in a region overlapping with qmd <dig>  were already identified by other groups  <cit> . for example, dirlewanger et al.  <cit>  mapped a major qtl for md on lg <dig> using an f <dig> population derived from the cross ferjalou jalousia x fantasia : based on available data, qmd <dig>  seems to overlap with their confidence intervals in different years, as supported by the ssrs udp97- <dig> and ampa  <dig>  that in jxf defined this region and are located on the peach genome sequence in scaffold  <dig> at position  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  respectively . in contrast to the mendelian behaviour of qmd <dig>  in our populations, in these previous studies md segregated as a quantitative trait with qtls mapped on different chromosomes. interestingly, these studies showed that the region spanning qmd <dig>  hosted a cluster of qtls associated with other traits such as fructose and sucrose content, titrable acidity, ph, sorbitol, maltose, citric acid, and quinic acid content  <cit> . recently, an association mapping study showed that another locus mapped at the beginning of chromosome  <dig>  associated with ssr marker cppct <dig>  was strongly associated with variation for the md trait  <cit> . this indicates that other loci controlling md can be identified using different segregating populations or association mapping. in addition, strong associations between md, ssc, flavonoids, sorbitol, and total sugars levels were also found in this study  <cit> .

identification and analysis of candidate genes
based on overlapping map positions of the qmd <dig>  locus in the cxa and wxby f <dig> populations, our hypothesis was that allelic variation at the same gene could explain the segregation of the md trait in both populations. thus, we searched for genomic variations within the region  <dig> - <dig>  mb identified by two wxby recombinants . twenty-five genes are annotated in this region of the peach genome  and we focused our attention on ppa007577m and ppa008301m, both predicted to encode nac transcription factors . nacs constitute one of the largest plant tf families and are key regulators of developmental programs and stress response  <cit> , and references therein]. initially, we sanger re-sequenced ppa007577m in the four parents c, a, w and by trying to identify polymorphisms within the gene, as well as in the  <dig>  kb upstream and downstream flanking sequences. sequence analysis did not show polymorphisms within the coding region, but revealed a  <dig> bp deletion, compared to the reference genome , at  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon. pcr amplification of this region showed that c is homozygous for the reference lovell allele, w homozygous for the deletion, whereas a and by are both heterozygous . in addition, pcr analysis of the cxa f <dig> parent for the  <dig> bp deletion showed that this individual was homozygous for the reference lovell allele . hence, no segregation was expected in the f <dig> cxa population. to further verify this hypothesis, inspection of this deletion was conducted screening some individuals of the three phenotypic classes  of the cxa f <dig> population. as expected from the parentsâ analysis, the deletion of  <dig> bp was absent in the analysed individuals. in contrast, the  <dig> bp deletion co-segregates with the phenotype in the selected individuals of the wxby f <dig> population being the f <dig> parent heterozygous at this locus. altogether, these results led us to search for others candidate genes for the md trait because ppa007577m does not segregate with the md trait in both populations.

we thus focused our attention on the second nac candidate gene ppa008301m. the sanger re-sequencing of the four parents and of the two f <dig> individuals uncovered an in-frame  <dig> bp insertion  resulting in a tandem duplication of three amino acids in the c-terminal domain . a, c, and by are heterozygous for this variant, whereas w is homozygous without the  <dig> bp insertion. both cxa and wxby f <dig> individuals were heterozygous for this polymorphism and further analyses on the f <dig> individuals were conducted to verify its correct segregation with the md trait. to this end, the  <dig> bp insertion/deletion  was scored using the genotyping protocol used for microsatellites analyses . the allelic variants co-segregated with the md of all the individuals in both f <dig> populations, with the early ripening individuals showing the  <dig> bp insertion and the late ripening individuals carrying the lovell reference allele . to further verify the map position, we added these data to the previous genotyping dataset used for map construction and qtl analysis. we found that this indel co-mapped with the md phenotypic marker . finally, repeating the qtl analysis in both populations showed co-location of this indel with qmd <dig>  .

as an additional confirmation that this  <dig> bp indel found in the last exon of the nac gene ppa008301m is the most probable polymorphism within the qmd <dig>  region, we searched the publicly available paired-end whole-genome next-generation sequencing data of the cxa f <dig> parent for sequence variants within the original target region. tableÂ  <dig> reports the results of this analysis. most of the identified polymorphisms were located in intergenic regions. only two polymorphisms were found within or near coding regions: the first in the 5â²-utr of a Î²-glucosidase  <dig> gene  involved in carbohydrate and phenylpropanoid metabolism, and the second being the  <dig> bp insertion in the nac candidate gene ppa008301m. even if polymorphisms in intergenic regions could cis-regulate the expression of target genes, the presence of the  <dig> bp insertion in the coding sequence of this nac candidate gene supports the hypothesis that the nac tf ppa008301m is a strong candidate gene for the control of md in the cxa and wxby populations.

a phylogenetic analysis of nacs identified in arabidopsis, rice, wheat, potato, banana and tomato indicates that nac genes ppa007577m and ppa008301m belong to two distinct clades . nac ppa007577m clustered with tomato nor  known to be involved in fruit ripening . first mapped on chromosome  <dig> by giovannoni et al.  <cit> , the nor gene seems to have a global effect on fruit ripening, probably acting upstream of ethylene synthesis  <cit> . related arabidopsis genes atnac <dig> and atnam   control embryogenesis by regulating the development and degeneration of ovule integuments  <cit> . the clade of ppa007577m includes also rice onac <dig> and wheat nac tfs nam_b <dig> and nam_b <dig> . nam-b <dig> and nam-b <dig> have been shown to be involved in delaying seed ripening with pleiotropic effects on grain protein, zinc, and iron content  <cit> . in contrast, functional analysis of onac <dig>  initially selected by the authors as the most similar rice nac tf to the wheat nam_b <dig>  excluded a role in seed ripening while showing that it is essential for correct anther development  <cit> . altogether, genes from the ppa007577m clade seem to have undergone a functional diversification, playing roles in distinct biological processes. the clade of nac tf ppa008301m included genes mainly involved in stress responses as arabidopsis anac <dig>  anac <dig> and anac <dig>  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that the closely related anac <dig> and anac <dig> play different roles during developmental senescence  <cit> . in fact, anac <dig> may be involved in triggering senescence by controlling and activating flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis, whereas anac <dig> seems to be involved in the response to chitin  <cit> . in addition, these genes showed opposing roles in the regulation the jasmonic and salicylic acid pathways  <cit> . unfortunately, literature about the involvement of nac tfs in ripening is at present very scanty. in banana gene expression profiles in fruit with four different ripening characteristics revealed that manac genes are expressed differentially in peel and pulp during ripening  <cit> . additionally, manac <dig> and manac <dig> physically interact with maeil <dig> , suggesting that these tfs could be involved in banana fruit ripening via interaction with ethylene signaling components.

our results also support the involvement of ppa008301m in the control of peach fruit ripening, indicating that genes in this clade may have evolved to fulfill different biological functions as proposed for the ppa007577m clade. while orthologs are often assumed to retain equivalent functions in different organisms, deviations from this situation are not uncommon  <cit> . being nacs one of the largest tf families, indication of the precise function of each member should be experimentally validated. the  <dig> bp indel in candidate gene ppa008301m results in the duplication of a threonine-aspartic acid-proline stretch with possible impact on protein function. simple amino acid repeats and regions rich in serine and threonine, proline and glutamine, or acidic residues are frequent in the c-terminal region of nac proteins  <cit> . while few studies were focused on nac post-translational modifications, lysine  <dig> and  <dig> in tomato slnac <dig> c-terminal region contribute additively to its degradation, whereas the substitution of both lysine residues with two aspartic acids significantly stabilized the slnac <dig> c-terminal protein sequence  <cit> . in addition, the c-terminal regions of several nac proteins function as transcriptional activation domains  <cit> ; and references therein]. domain deletion analysis on the arabidopsis nac gene ataf <dig>  revealed that the transactivation activity was conferred by the c-terminal domain and did not require the n-terminal domain  <cit> . hence, the three amino acid indel in ppa008301m, possibly modifying the c-terminal domain structure, might influence the protein stability or its transcriptional activation capability and, consequently, the transcriptional activation of target genes.

interestingly, we found in both populations that the early ripening individuals possessed the three amino acid insertion in the protein sequence, whereas delayed ripening was associated with the reference allele.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report the fine mapping of a major locus controlling maturity date trait in peach, using two different populations. the strategy allowed us to restrict the previously described locus from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb. the nac gene ppa008301m was identified as a strong candidate within this region and a consistent  <dig> bp insertion in its last exon was proposed as the variant possibly causing early ripening. further experiments are needed to explore the functional significance of this indel. in any case, the marker developed on this sequence polymorphism provides a convenient molecular tool to discriminate early vs. late ripening individuals within the cxa, wxby and likely other breeding populations. considering the proposed pleiotropic effect of qmd <dig>  on other important fruit traits, our results provide a basis to better define breeding programs for fruit quality improvement.
