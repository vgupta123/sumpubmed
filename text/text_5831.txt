BACKGROUND
in humans, kidney cancer is a complex disease comprising several different tumor types characterized by different somatic mutations and showing different histological features and clinical courses 
 <cit> . risk factors include smoking, obesity and hypertension 
 <cit> . genetic factors also underlie the predisposition to renal cancers, as familial aggregations have been reported and the risk of developing the disease for first-degree relatives of renal cancer patients is  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold higher than that of the general population 
 <cit> . studies of families with hereditary kidney cancers have permitted the identification of mutations in several genes, including the tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> genes linked with tuberous sclerosis, a multi-system hamartoma syndrome . in addition, genome-wide association analyses in large case–control studies have detected three loci, on chromosomes 2p <dig>  11q <dig> , and 12p <dig>  
 <cit> , associated with an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma , the most common renal cancer in humans. despite this progress, there is still much to unravel about the genetic susceptibility to this heterogeneous disease; the ability to study the genetics of renal cancer in a mouse model would therefore prove advantageous.

until now, a mouse model suitable for studying the genetics of the inherited predisposition to renal tumor has not been described but, as we show here, does already exist. we previously developed the airmax and airmin mouse lines by phenotypically selecting, from a heterogeneous population, mice that had either an intense or a weak acute inflammatory response  
 <cit> . the phenotypes used to select these strains were the number of infiltrated leukocytes and the protein content at the site of inflammation induced by the subcutaneous injection of a non-specific, non-immunogenic agent  
 <cit> . after about  <dig> generations of selective breeding, airmax and airmin mouse lines presented extreme “maximal” and “minimum” phenotypes, respectively 
 <cit>  and, at that limit, were considered to be homozygous for the quantitative trait loci  that control the acute inflammatory reaction. in addition to the inflammatory response, airmax and airmin mice differ in their susceptibility to several types of chemically induced tumors, in particular in the lung, skin and colon 
. for example, adult airmax mice are resistant and airmin are susceptible to developing lung tumors in response to urethane 
 <cit> , a multiorgan carcinogen with a short half-life  
 <cit> . although the susceptibility of these mice to kidney tumors has not yet been studied, we were motivated to investigate their suitability as a model system for studying renal cancer genetics, especially because in humans the inflammatory response seems to play a role in the prognosis of renal cancer patients 
 <cit> .

in the present study, a single dose of urethane injected in 7-day old mice induced, in addition to lung tumors, multiple renal tumors in airmin mice but not in airmax mice. the genetic basis for the different susceptibility of the two lines was investigated by genome-wide snp genotyping followed by linkage analysis with renal tumor incidence in the pedigree of a large f <dig> intercross population.

RESULTS
renal tumorigenesis in airmax and airmin mice and in interline crosses
untreated airmax mice , when analyzed at 57 weeks of age, had no renal tumors, whereas  <dig>  of  <dig> untreated airmin mice had spontaneous renal tumors at the same age. when mice pups were treated with urethane at 7 days and followed until 35 weeks of age, airmax mice remained resistant to renal tumorigenesis and did not develop any gross kidney tumor . in contrast,  <dig>  of  <dig> urethane-treated airmin mice developed such tumors. susceptibility to renal tumorigenesis was inherited as a co-dominant trait, since the incidence of renal tumors in urethane-treated f <dig> mice was 39% while that in the f <dig> intercross population was 25%. no statistically significant difference was observed in renal tumor incidence between male and female mice in any line.figure  <dig>

tumor-bearing mice usually had multiple kidney tumors, which varied in size as seen both at gross examination and microscopically. histopathological analysis of kidney tumors in selected f <dig> mice revealed the occurrence of lesions suggestive of papillary renal cell tumors, characterized by malignant epithelial cells constituting papillae and lining tubules . tumor-lined cysts with papillary excrescences were also seen . immunohistochemical analysis showed diffuse, marked staining for alpha-methylacyl-coa racemase  , which in humans is a sensitive marker for papillary renal neoplasms. staining for cd <dig>  which is a marker of clear cell rcc and which is less frequently expressed by papillary tumors, was negative in our model .figure  <dig>

in addition, we carried out real-time pcr on rna extracted from renal tumors and normal kidney tissue to measure the mrna levels of known markers of these tumors. this analysis showed that the vimentin and β2-microglobulin genes were upregulated in renal tumors of f <dig> mice  compared to normal renal tissue .

one major locus controls renal tumor susceptibility in air mice
of the  <dig> f <dig> intercross mice available, genomic dna and renal tumor phenotype were available for  <dig> animals. these mice were genotyped using snp arrays representing a panel of  <dig> snps. after quality control filtering of the genotype data,  <dig> markers  resulted informative and were used in genome-wide linkage analysis. a statistical threshold for linkage with renal tumor incidence was determined by permutation analysis, resulting in a logarithm of odds  score of  <dig> , for α= <dig>  genome-wide statistical probabilities .

genome-wide linkage analysis detected a single qtl on chromosome  <dig>  with a peak lod score of  <dig> , at  <dig>  mb . the 1-lod support interval was 11 mb long, ranging from  <dig> to 29 mb . the snps flanking the lod score peak were rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . we designated this locus renal tumor modifier qtl  <dig>  associated with the incidence of renal tumors induced by urethane treatment. no other region of the genome showed a significant or suggestive association with the phenotype. therefore, the rtm <dig> qtl likely harbors one or more genes with major effects in renal tumorigenesis.figure  <dig>

association analysis showed that, at snp rs <dig>  the g allele inherited from airmax mice confers resistance whereas the a allele from parental airmin was associated with a  <dig> -fold increase in odds ratio  for renal tumor development . the ors associated at each genotype in f <dig> mice showed a very strong association of homozygosity or heterozygosity of the airmin-derived a allele with renal tumor incidence . homozygous inheritance of the airmin-derived allele at this locus caused a ~16–fold increase in the incidence of renal tumors . similar findings were observed at the rs <dig>  with the airmin-derived allele associated with an increased risk of renal tumors .figure  <dig> 
odds ratios  of renal tumor incidence of f <dig> mice by genotype at rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  located near the peak lod score of genetic linkage between renal tumor incidence and genomic variants. at the reference genotype gg, carried by airmax mice, renal tumors were observed in  <dig> of 163 f <dig> mice . at the ga genotype, renal tumors were seen in  <dig> of  <dig> mice , while at the aa genotype renal tumors were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> mice . ors and 95% cis are reported on a logarithmic scale.



in the 1-lod interval of the rtm <dig> locus, between  <dig> and 29 mb,  <dig> known or predicted genes mapa. among these genes, the tsc <dig> gene, located within the lod score peak, at  <dig> - <dig>  mb, seems particularly relevant, due to its known involvement in renal tumorigenesis in rats, humans and genetically modified mice.

genotypes of the 662 f <dig> mice were also assessed for association with the inflammatory response measured by the number of infiltrating cells  at the local exudates induced by a subcutaneous injection of bio-gel p- <dig>  the lod score thresholds for linkage of ncell, determined by permutation analysis, were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for α= <dig>  and α= <dig>  genome-wide statistical probabilities . on chromosome  <dig>  which contains the rtm <dig> locus, no loci had lod scores above the genome-wide thresholds . this result indicates that rtm <dig> is independent of any loci associated with the inflammatory response.

discussion
our findings show that airmin mice carry a co-dominant genetic susceptibility trait to renal tumorigenesis induced by urethane. by genome-wide linkage mapping of an f <dig> intercross population, we found that such trait is regulated by germline genetic variations in a locus in the proximal region of chromosome  <dig>  within this locus, which we named rtm <dig>  the a allele of rs <dig> was associated with a  <dig> -fold increase in or for renal tumor development; homozygous inheritance of this allele from airmin mice increased the incidence of renal tumors by ~16–fold. the rtm <dig> locus is novel and unique, as no other loci modulating renal tumorigenesis have previously been mapped in mouse crosses.

no significant linkage was found between the inflammatory response and snps on chromosome  <dig>  this finding indicates that the rtm <dig> locus was fixed during phenotypic selection of air mice, independently from loci modulating inflammatory response phenotypes. such a phenomenon may be due to random genetic drift, as already proposed for skin tumorigenesis in selected mouse lines 
 <cit> .

airmax and airmin mice are known to differ in susceptibility to chemically induced tumors 
, and here we show that they also differ in susceptibility to spontaneous tumors: in the absence of any carcinogenic treatment, >50% of airmin mice developed renal tumors at 57 weeks of age, whereas no airmax mouse did. although we did not carry out a time-course analysis of spontaneous renal tumor incidence, we noticed that after urethane treatment of 1-week-old airmin mice, renal tumors were observed earlier  and with an increased incidence  as compared to spontaneous renal tumorigenesis in the same mouse line. in contrast, urethane treatment did not induce renal tumors in the genetically resistant airmax mice. therefore, it seems that a correlation exists between strain susceptibility to spontaneous and urethane-induced renal tumorigenesis, as has already been observed for lung tumorigenesis in a meta-analysis of numerous inbred mouse strains 
 <cit> . our results suggest that both spontaneous and urethane-induced renal tumors are controlled by the same genetic locus, i.e., rtm <dig>  although we cannot exclude that additional loci may control spontaneous renal tumor susceptibility in air mice.

characterization of the renal tumors by immunohistochemistry showed the expression of amacr, a peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzyme involved in the β-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives. the amacr gene has one of the highest expression levels in papillary rcc in humans 
 <cit> . the presence of cd <dig> , on the other hand, was not detected. this protein is a cell membrane neutral endopeptidase which participates in the post-secretory inactivation of inflammatory and vasoactive peptides 
 <cit> . in the diagnosis of renal tumors, cd <dig> is more often positive in clear cell rcc than in papillary rcc 
 <cit> . real-time pcr pointed to the overexpression of vimentin and β2-microglobulin. vimentin protein positivity has been reported in both clear cell and papillary rccs in human samples 
 <cit> , and β2-microglobulin overexpression has been detected in human rcc 
 <cit> .

spontaneous renal tumors are rare in inbred mouse strains 
 <cit> . one exception is the balb/c substrain balb/cf/cd, which has a 24%-70% incidence of kidney adenocarcinomas 
 <cit> , probably due to the insertion of the mouse mammary tumor virus into a not yet identified chromosomal domain that is implicated in kidney tumorigenesis 
 <cit> . gene disruption is also known to cause spontaneous renal carcinoma in the eker rat, where an endogenous retroviral element  has integrated into an intron of the tumor suppressor gene tuberous sclerosis  <dig>  
. this intronic transposition leads to the production of aberrant tsc <dig> transcripts, causing a functional inactivation of the tsc <dig> gene which leads to renal tumorigenesis.

the murine tsc <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> maps to the rtm <dig> locus peak identified in this study. this gene spans over  <dig>  kb, contains  <dig> exons, generates a full length transcript of 6018 bp and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acidsb. the protein, called tuberin or tsc <dig> , controls the mtor  signaling pathway 
 <cit> . of the  <dig> known polymorphisms in this gene among inbred strainsc; four are missense variants in exons whereas the others are found in introns or in the upstream or downstream regions where they might play a role in modulating transcript levels. the gene’s genomic location and involvement in renal tumorigenesis in the rat make tsc <dig> a good candidate for the air renal tumor locus. interestingly, tsc <dig> mice develop renal cystadenomas 
 <cit> . sequencing the tsc <dig> gene in airmax and airmin mice, as well as in mice of their f <dig> intercross, may reveal polymorphisms that, by influencing tsc <dig> expression or tuberin function, modulate the susceptibility of these mice to renal tumorigenesis.

another candidate gene that maps close to tsc <dig> is the pkd <dig> gene, which encodes the transmembrane protein polycystin- <dig>  mutations leading to a loss of function at this gene cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in both humans 
 <cit>  and mouse models 
 <cit> . polycystin- <dig> is involved in cell adhesion and has been shown to inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion, leading to the suggestion that pdk <dig> is a tumor suppressor gene 
 <cit> . there is also a functional link between tsc <dig> and pkd1: in human cells, tsc <dig> protein alternates from an inactive, phosphorylated form in the cytosol to an active, non-phosphorylated form at the plasma membrane bound to the intracellular, carboxy-terminal tail of polycystin-1; in this subcellular position, tsc <dig> protein activates the gtpase of rheb, resulting in the inactivation of the mtor pathway 
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
herein, we mapped rtm <dig> as a novel mouse modifier locus of chemically induced renal tumorigenesis in pedigrees of non-inbred mice. this locus spans the tsc2-pkd <dig> region of chromosome  <dig>  whose candidate genes are involved in renal cancer in animal models and humans. these results point to the possible involvement of polymorphisms in this region in the functional regulation of mouse renal tumorigenesis. further analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the tsc2-pkd <dig> region distinguishing the two air lines at the rtm <dig> qtl region described in this study will allow the identification of the functional variant responsible for the high susceptibility to spontaneous and urethane-induced renal tumorigenesis of airmin mice and may provide insight into new modulating mechanisms of renal tumorigenesis in other species, including humans.
