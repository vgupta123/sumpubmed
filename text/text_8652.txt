BACKGROUND
high-throughput genotyping has revolutionized genetic analyses in humans, livestock species, crop and model plants in the past decade . covering genomes with high resolution, single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping arrays facilitate the detection of associations between snps and phenotypes. they represent a powerful tool for dissecting complex traits via genome-wide association studies  or quantitative trait locus  analysis as well as for fine mapping genes of interest and forward genetics cloning strategies . in addition, they are broadly used in crop and livestock breeding for germplasm characterization and marker assisted selection  <cit> . the availability of high density genotyping arrays has enabled breakthroughs in genome-wide approaches such as genomic prediction and detection of selection signatures . here, we describe the development of the currently largest publicly available snp array in crop species and discuss its potential for different applications in maize.

maize is one of the most important crops worldwide serving as food, livestock feed, and component of industrial products. a key step in corn production was the establishment of divergent heterotic patterns for hybrid breeding  <cit> . most worldwide hybrid breeding programs exploit heterotic effects between different subgroups within the dent pool, whereas crosses between the two maize pools, dent and flint, are mainly used in hybrid breeding for the cooler regions in central europe. maize production has continuously risen over time, but to further increase selection gain and accelerate breeding processes profound knowledge is required regarding genes and genomic regions involved in agronomically important traits.

genotyping arrays offer an efficient alternative to whole genome sequence data for gaining genomic information in high-throughput. however, the establishment of a high density genotyping array requires the identification of a large number of variants polymorphic in a representative discovery panel to ensure its utility for a wide range of approaches and study designs. in maize, the identification of sequence variants for genomic analyses faces specific challenges due to its evolutionary history and high variability of its genome. as an ancient polyploid species, the maize genome is characterized by numerous duplicated chromosomal regions giving rise to paralogous sequences . a reference sequence exists for maize, which covers around 90% of the  <dig>  gb genome of inbred line b <dig> , but the high amount of transposable elements, paralogs, copy number variants  as well as structural variants like presence/absence variants , is a challenge for reliable sequence read alignment and variant identification due to ambiguous sequence read mapping results  <cit> . despite recent reports like the comprehensive genotyping of the usa national maize inbred seed bank  <cit>  using snps identified through genotyping by sequencing  at low sequence coverage  <cit> , sequencing-based approaches such as gbs have to cope with large amounts of missing data and require the establishment of demanding bioinformatics pipelines and imputing algorithms, which may not be routine in all labs.

the highest resolution of a commercially available genotyping array for maize has been achieved by the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> . it has been used extensively for genetic studies  and is composed of 50 k usable snps. this number of snps is in the same range as for recently published genotyping arrays for rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> , but much lower compared to high density genotyping arrays which are available for animal species, e.g. chicken  <cit>  and cattle with 648 k and 777 k, respectively  <cit> , as well as for humans with more than 900 k snp variants  <cit> . especially for maize with its large genome size and high level of diversity, high marker resolution is desirable. in addition, linkage disequilibrium  decays rapidly in some germplasm, e.g. in landraces or highly diverse sample panels  <cit>  emphazising the requirement of higher marker densities than so far available on genotyping arrays.

we selected sequence variants for the design of a high density 600 k snp genotyping array for maize based on 57 m snps and small indels that were discovered by mapping whole genome sequencing reads of  <dig> representative temperate maize lines against b <dig> agp_v <dig>  for experimental validation, we selected  <dig>  m variants by applying stringent filtering criteria. this  <dig>  m subset was used to genotype  <dig> maize samples representing the genetic diversity of european  and american  temperate maize as well as a sample of tropical maize lines. we created a final selection of  <dig>  high quality variants based on their assay performance, physical distribution, and concordance with in silico variant calls from sequencing data. here, we describe the design of the high density affymetrix® axiom® maize genotyping array which represents a powerful tool for fine-mapping of genomic regions, genome-wide studies, and detection of marker-trait associations. we also demonstrate its application for investigating subpopulation structure and ld in diverse maize germplasm.

RESULTS
discovery and pre-selection of variants
for variant  discovery we sequenced  <dig> maize inbreds composed of  <dig> european flint lines as well as nine european and four us dent lines . the lines represent important founder lines for maize breeding in europe and the us and have been used in previous studies  <cit> . mapping the generated sequence reads to the b <dig> reference sequence  resulted in 50-fold sequence coverage on average of four deep sequenced lines  as well as 12-fold coverage on average of the  <dig> remaining lines. based on the mapped sequence reads  <dig> , <dig> variant positions were identified.

a filtered list of variants was created for quality score determination similar to the dual approach of chia et al.  <cit> . variants were included in this list if they were identified independently by two different programs, samtools  <cit>  and gatk  <cit>  and were characterized by high quality scores as well as presence of reference  and non-reference alleles in the discovery panel. applying these filters, the initial variant number was reduced by a factor of  <dig>  we finally selected  <dig> , <dig> bi-allelic variants for further analysis.  <dig> %  of these variant positions were congruent with variants reported by  <cit>  for the maize hapmap <dig> data. of  <dig>  variants from the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip which could be uniquely anchored to the b <dig> reference sequence,  <dig>   were also covered by in silico snp calls from sequencing in our set of  <dig>  m variants. this proportion is higher than the  <dig> % overlap reported in the maize hapmap <dig> snp dataset reported by  <cit>  and can most likely be attributed to the higher sequence coverage in our study.

selection of high-confidence variants for array construction
a multi-step filtering approach was applied to reduce the number of  <dig>  m variants to a subset of  <dig>  m variants for experimental validation on two affymetrix® axiom® 600 k screening arrays . from those, 616 k were selected for the design of the 600 k array.figure  <dig>

variant selection according to in-silico analysis of sequence data
the  <dig>  m variants were filtered according to quality and their support by sequence reads. the sequenced lines were inbred lines with only minor residual heterozygosity  as determined from illumina® maizesnp <dig> data. in the  <dig>  m variants, we observed  <dig> % heterozygous compared to  <dig> % homozygous calls, which was not expected from the illumina® maizesnp <dig> genotyping data. besides “true” heterozygous calls, such calls may arise from the large fraction of segmental duplications as well as orthologous and paralogous sequences retained in the ancient polyploid maize genome  <cit> . in line with this, the false discovery rate  of heterozygous calls was significantly higher  compared to the fdr of homozygous calls  as determined by comparison with variant calls from the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip. thus, in order to create a list of high quality variants only homozygous calls were considered for further analysis.

we decided to include all available  <dig>  coding variants on the screening arrays, as these variants have a greater potential than non-coding variants to affect gene function. to enable comparison across studies, we further included  <dig>  snps of the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip as “must-have” variants. the remaining ~ 1 m positions on the screening arrays were filled with non-coding variants based on their distribution across the genome. similar to the strategy reported by kranis et al.  <cit> , we applied a bin based approach with the intention to create a subset of physically equally distributed variants. we observed that variant numbers in centromeric bins were always lower than in telomeric bins, indicating lower polymorphism rates in the centromeric regions. this reduction of variant numbers around the centromeres was also observed in other maize studies  <cit>  and may result from the high proportion of repetitive dna around the centromeres for which no markers can be developed. aiming simultaneously for a balanced representation of pool-specific as well as shared variants between dent and flint,  <dig>  variants were included in the list for validation. we selected  <dig>  additional variants to specifically increase the number of variants in under-represented bins to reach a final number of  <dig> , <dig> variants which could be placed on the screening arrays. the marker density on the screening arrays was one variant per ~  <dig>  kb on average over all chromosomes .

variant validation by genotyping  <dig> representative maize samples
in order to assemble a robust set of variants for design of the 600 k array, the selected set of  <dig>  m variants was used to genotype  <dig> dna samples from  <dig> diverse worldwide maize inbred lines and hybrids for the evaluation of variant performance . we investigated conversion performance of the variants on the array with respect to  genotype call rates, cluster separation, and reproducibility,  polymorphism in the panel under study, and  consistent mendelian inheritance from parents to off-spring in trios.

hybridization intensity signals were clustered by the affymetrix axiom gt <dig> algorithm and interpreted as homozygous, heterozygous, or no calls, respectively. different from the situation in humans or animals, where samples are highly heterozygous, most of the samples in our maize validation panel were highly inbred. thus, we compared genotype calls obtained with and without applying an inbred correction factor . this factor was assigned to each sample to adjust the probability of observing a heterozygous call given the inbreeding level of the sample. the average call rate of the screening arrays could be increased by  <dig> % to  <dig> % upon inbred correction . with inbred correction, inbred line b <dig> exhibited the highest call rate  and one f <dig> hybrid  together with teosinte  the lowest call rates. furthermore, american maize lines revealed higher call rates on average compared to european lines, followed by call rates of tropical lines and hybrids. this is in accordance with the literature  <cit>  and suggests a negative correlation between call rate and increasing sequence divergence to the reference sequence of b <dig> from which probe sequences on the array were derived.

based on genotype call cluster separation, cluster variance, and cluster position, variants were assigned to one out of six quality categories . comparing the category assignments with and without inbred correction resulted in a change of category in  <dig> % of all variants . as expected, the category of variants fulfilling all cluster metric criteria and classified as “polyhighresolution”  increased most, resulting in a gain of  <dig> % upon inbred correction. details on the number of variants from each category with and without inbred correction are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in total,  <dig> % of the newly developed  <dig> , <dig> variants  failed to convert and did not give reliable genotype calls upon inbred correction . the proportion of  <dig> % converted variants is lower than in a similar study in chicken, where  <dig> % of the variants could be converted into successful variants  <cit> . in rice which has an around five-fold smaller and less complex genome than maize, 84% of variants of the illumina® ricesnp <dig> array  <cit>  were converted successfully . given the higher complexity of the maize genome compared to chicken or rice, our conversion rate is in the expected range.

selection of high-confidence variants and composition of the 600 k array
for the selection of high-confidence variants for the 600 k array, we applied a voting system based on  their performance on the screening arrays,  concordance of array genotyping calls with in silico variant calls from sequencing data of the  <dig> maize lines in the discovery panel, and  over- or under-representation of the corresponding bin. to ensure a high performance on the final array, the highest weight was assigned to the first criterion. we focussed on clearly separated genotype clusters with little variance that were not influenced by information regarding the inbreeding level . applying this procedure the  <dig>  highest scoring variants as well as  <dig>  snps of the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip were included in the final selection for the 600 k array .

the 600 k genotyping array is composed of  <dig>  variants , corresponding to an average density of one variant per ~  <dig>  kb . the average genetic distance between variants is  <dig>  cm, which corresponds to  <dig> variants per cm. the variants are evenly distributed across the chromosomes with the only exception of one region on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  where the maximal distance between neighboring variants exceeds  <dig>  mb. despite a specific filter aiming for equal variant distribution according to the physical map distance, the final distribution followed the average recombination rate along chromosomes, which reflects varying polymorphism rates in the material under study . the highest density of variants was found in gene enriched telomeric regions, thus ensuring the maximal possible amount of genetic information in regions with high recombination rates. a comparable pattern of variant distribution as well as a lack of variants on the short arm of maize chromosome  <dig> in the nucleolus organizer region  has been reported previously  <cit> . from the  <dig>  variants represented on the affymetrix® axiom® maize array  <dig>   are also present in the maize hapmap <dig> variants  <cit> .figure  <dig>

all  <dig>  variant positions were annotated based on the b <dig> filtered gene set which comprises  <dig>  genes , resulting in  <dig>  genes  tagged with at least one variant in their coding, intronic, or utr region, compared to  <dig>  genes tagged by snps of the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip . including 5 kb up- and downstream regions,  <dig>  genes  were represented by at least one variant, thus providing an excellent basis for finding marker-trait associations in targeted and genome-wide approaches.

to determine the reproducibility of variants represented on the 600 k array, technical and biological replicates were analysed. first, three technical b <dig> replicates as internal controls exhibited up to  <dig> % of identical genotype calls . three biological replicates from different seed sources exhibited a high level of concordant genotype calls in the range of  <dig> % to  <dig> %. furthermore, two lines  were represented by two samples each comprised of a single plant and a pooled sample, respectively, showing  <dig> % and  <dig> % concordance. some lack of concordance here can be explained by residual heterozygosity in the pooled samples. for determination of stable mendelian inheritance,  <dig> trios with both parental lines as well as the corresponding f <dig> hybrid were analysed. these trios revealed stable mendelian inheritance between parental lines and their offspring in  <dig> % of the variants. after excluding the trio with the lowest call rate  stable mendelian inheritance could be observed in  <dig> % of the variants, underlining the call rate as an indication of sample quality. the analysis of biological and technical replicates and trios confirmed the high reproducibility of genotype calls obtained with the variants represented on the affymetrix® axiom® maize array which is in the same range as reported for the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> .

the usefulness of a genotyping array is characterized by the number of variants polymorphic in the panel of genotypes under study. in the  <dig> public maize lines, two teosinte accessions, and 23 f <dig> hybrids used in this study for validation,  <dig> % of the 600 k array variants were polymorphic. only a small number of  <dig> variants  were monomorphic across all samples of the validation panel. after excluding three genotypic samples without clear germplasm group assignment,  <dig> % of the 600 k variants were polymorphic within dent ,  <dig> % in flint , and  <dig> % within f <dig> hybrids , respectively . only  <dig> % of the variants were polymorphic within the two teosinte accessions. it must be noted however, that with only two samples the diversity in teosinte is not well captured in our validation panel. additionally, the array was not optimized for wild maize relatives as they were not included in the discovery panel. the high overall polymorphism rate depicts the quality of the filtering procedure and is in line or even exceeding results obtained by other studies regarding genotype array validation in animals and plants  <cit> . it confirms the utility of the array for a wide range of applications in maize germplasm.figure  <dig>

among the selected variants, one category called “off-target variants”  was of special interest since these  <dig>  variants detect previously uncharacterized variants in the flanking region of the target variant. due to a reduced hybridization efficiency otvs are characterized by cluster splits or additional relatively low signal intensity clusters compared to expected homozygous and heterozygous genotypes  and have been shown to be reproducible  <cit> . these 46 k variants offer the possibility not only to analyse the genotype call of the target variant, but provide in addition information on presence or absence of putative additional variants in the flanking regions. the latter information can be treated as a bi-allelic flanking variant and was included for population structure analyses.

analysis of population substructure
the identification of population substructure is crucial for quantitative genetic or population genetic studies since population stratification or admixture may affect detection of marker-trait associations, genomic prediction, or estimation of population genetic parameters. to determine the ability of the variants represented on the maize 600 k genotyping array to resolve population structure, we performed principal coordinate  and admixture analyses of  <dig> public inbred lines. the first principal coordinate revealed a clear separation of dent and flint with a small group of samples located in the center . this central group included tropical flint and dent lines, the popcorn accession, two lines with unknown pedigree as well as flint lines that originated from southern spain and one flint line tracing back to argentina. the clear separation of dent and flint reflects their genetic differentiation for more than  <dig>  years  <cit> , accompanied by varying adaptive and selective pressures. similar results were obtained in studies based on isozymes  <cit> , rflps  <cit> , ssrs  <cit> , and snps  <cit> . analyzing the  <dig> dent lines separately , the first two axes further subdivided the samples into distinct subgroups, namely iowa stiff stalk synthetic , iodent, and lancaster sure crop , with several non-bsss and tropical lines in the center. the three groups bsss, non-bsss , and iodent represent three major heterotic groups within temperate dent, whose strong differentiation is well-known  <cit> . compared to us material, european samples clustered within each group more towards the center , suggesting a lower level of differentiation and population substructure  <cit> .figure  <dig>

in central europe, flint plays an important role for hybrid breeding programs relying on the dent x flint heterotic pattern. pcoa of  <dig> flint lines as well as one popcorn and two sweetcorn accessions resulted in the separation of european flint lines adapted to more northern or mediterranean climate, respectively . this split has also been observed in other studies based on phenotypic and rflp marker data  <cit>  and can be traced back to the introgression of maize to europe. maize was introduced to europe starting at the end of the 15th century, when columbus brought subtropical maize from the caribbean islands to southern spain, later followed by travelers importing so called northern flint  <cit>  from canada to northern france . the “non-northern” flint group in our study was further subdivided in the pcoa by the second axis depicting the relatedness of a subset of samples which had the french line f <dig> in their ancestry. thus, the first two axes revealed two main subgroups of european flint although the substructure was not as pronounced as in dent. as indicated in figure  <dig> , the sequenced lines of the variant discovery panel were nicely distributed across the different germplasm pools.

cross-validation results obtained by admixture  <cit>  suggested k =  <dig> as the most likely number of groups  with four clear clusters in dent for bsss, iodents, lsc, and a mixed group of non-bsss lines, as well as two clusters for northern flints and non-northern flints, and a mixed group of tropical lines or lines with ancestors of tropical origin. this grouping well reflects the main subgroups observed with pcoa. in accordance with an increasing sequence divergence to the reference sequence of b <dig>  admixture analysis based on the 46 k flanking otvs resulted in the subdivision of dent, flint, and a group including tropical lines as well as flint lines originating from argentina, spain, and italy .

we conclude that the variants represented on the 600 k array are well suited for dissecting the diversity and genetic composition of temperate maize lines. performance of the array with regard to the analysis of tropical material or wild maize relatives will need further investigation.

extent of linkage disequilibrium
the extent of ld in a population is influenced by recombination rate, drift, mutation, selection, and population structure. it has thus influence on experimental design, resolution, and analysis of genome-wide studies. in the public inbred lines genotyped for validation, ld decay  could be observed within 158 kb on average with some chromosomal differences . group specific analysis of the ld extent revealed a substantially higher level of ld in the two dent groups of iodents and bsss with mean ld decay distances of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, respectively, compared to non-bsss lines  where ld decayed within 239 kb. due to the rather small sample size in lsc , decay distances were not calculated for this subset. mean ld decay values in flint were highest for non-northern flints, which included several lines sharing a common ancestor, with  <dig>  mb, followed by northern flints . the fastest ld decay was observed in tropical lines . this corroborates previous reports supporting the close relationship and small number of founder lines within iodent and bsss compared to the other groups  <cit> . the low values of the non-bsss as well as the tropical lines in our study might be explained by the high heterogeneity of both groups. still, ld levels in our panel of maize lines were higher compared to previous studies reporting the breakdown of ld within distances between  <dig> and 10 kb  <cit>  in highly diverse maize lines. the higher ld extent in our study might be due to the sample panel analysed, which mainly comprised temperate elite maize inbred lines belonging to distinct germplasm pools but no landraces or wild species. the variants selected for the 600 k array fulfill the requirements by  <cit> , after which genotyping arrays should have sufficient coverage to capture the fastest ld decay of the considered heterotic pools. thus, especially for analysis of diverse sample panels, high density genotyping arrays are of interest for estimating global and local ld.table  <dig>

other potential applications of the maize high density array
we presented the usefulness of the maize high density 600 k array for the analysis of population structure and ld, but of course it is suitable for many other applications in maize research and breeding. for population genetic analyses based on genotyping data ascertainment bias is a central aspect  <cit> . the lines sequenced in this study were chosen to represent the diversity within the more comprehensive validation panel. however, bias may be introduced by the filtering steps that are applied during array development and typically results in a bias towards intermediate allele frequencies. flanking otvs have the advantage of not being directly targeted by the variant filtering procedure itself offering thus the potential to counteract ascertainment bias  <cit> . compared to the minor allele frequency  distribution of the complete set of variants of the 600 k array where only  <dig> % of the variants detect rare alleles with a maf <  <dig> , otvs showed with  <dig> % rare alleles  a reduced bias towards intermediate allele frequencies . thus, even if the specific type of the variant as well as its exact location is unknown, flanking otvs represent an interesting subset of variants for population genetic analyses like screens for selection signatures based on genotyping data which we will address in further studies.figure  <dig>

further applications of the 600 k array include its use in genome-wide and targeted approaches. the array should have the desired density for genome-wide association studies in maize, for which the currently available density of the illumina® maizesnp <dig> beadchip was shown to provide limited resolution  <cit> . due to the extremely high marker density, the array can be used for bulked segregant analysis to identify genomic regions involved in phenotypic traits with monogenic or oligogenic inheritance  <cit> . further applications may be seen in the context of plant variety protection and in the investigation of pedigree relationships, identity-by-descent regions and ancestral lineages  <cit> . a panel of representative lines genotyped with the 600 k array should also allow high accuracy in imputation of genotypes from genetic material analysed with lower density marker panels  <cit> . finally, custom sets of snps may be assembled from any genomic region and converted into other highly flexible snp assay formats to saturate specific regions in fine-mapping, map-based cloning studies or marker-assisted selection, since flanking sequence information is available and conversion rates among snp platforms are generally high.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes the establishment of the currently largest publicly available snp array in crop species composed of  <dig>  snps and small indels. the affymetrix® axiom® maize array is optimized for european and american temperate maize. it is well suited for fine-mapping of genomic regions, genome-wide studies, and detection of marker-trait associations. important aspects in the development of the maize 600 k genotyping array were:  identification of polymorphic, high-confidence variants based on whole genome sequence data of  <dig> representative temperate maize lines,  selection of physically equally distributed variants for validation, taking predicted variant performance and subgroup specific segregation into account,  experimental variant validation by genotyping  <dig> dna samples originating from diverse subgroups of maize, and  final selection of variants upon stringent filtering based on cluster metrics, concordance with in silico calls, and physical position. we have shown that the variants selected for the 600 k genotyping array were polymorphic in a broad maize panel, ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. we investigated a subset of variants  that showed almost no bias towards intermediate allele frequencies, thus are potentially of interest for population genetic analyses. finally, we performed principal coordinate, admixture, and ld analyses to illustrate the potential of the array to analyse population substructure and ld decay with high resolution.
