BACKGROUND
photosynthetic organisms that support much of the life on earth, in using solar energy to renew the oxygenic atmosphere and make up organic assimilates essential to the food chain  <cit>  are frequently challenged with toxic reactive oxygen species  generated by respiration and photosynthesis  <cit> , and toxic metals that constitute persistent pollutants because they cannot be degraded. one of them, cadmium , is very abundant in the environment as it is often combined with sulfur in earth's crust, and it is also intensively spread out as  a by-product of zinc mining,  the burning of fossil fuel,  the dispersal of sewage sludge and phosphate fertilizers, and  the manufacturing of paints, batteries and screens  <cit> . subsequently, cd can be transferred to the food chain, and bio-accumulated in human where it has a half-life greater than  <dig> years  <cit>  and causes various diseases by as yet unclear processes  <cit> . even metals that are essential to enzyme activity, such as zinc and iron  <cit> , can become toxic when occurring in excess. this toxicity is likely due to the poisoning replacement of the cognate metal cofactor of diverse metalloenzymes, a phenomenon sometimes leading to oxidative stress  <cit> .

cyanobacteria, the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on earth  <cit> , are attractive models to investigate the interrelations between metal toxicity and oxidative stress, because they perform the two metal-requiring  <cit>  ros-generating processes  <cit> , photosynthesis and respiration, in the same membrane system  <cit> . furthermore, cyanobacteria share a wide range of genes in common with plants  <cit> , in agreement with they being the likely ancestor of chloroplast  <cit> . thus, lessons learned from stress responses in cyanobacteria will also greatly facilitate the understanding of how plant cells face environmental challenges. this is important, as cd has been reported to be toxic to plants by as yet unknown processes that may  <cit>  or may not  <cit>  impair photosynthesis. moreover, cyanobacteria are also suitable for biosensor and/or bioremediation applications  <cit> .

using the model cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc <dig> that possesses a small genome  <cit>  fully sequenced, and easily manipulable with replicating plasmids  <cit> , we have analyzed the global responses of photosynthetic cells challenged with cd, h2o <dig>  or drastic changes of availability of either fe or zn, through  dna microarrays;  absorption spectroscopy;  oxygen evolution;  western blot;  targeted gene inactivation and  assays of cell fitness. we show that cd triggers a "yin yang" integrated reorganization of the cyanobacterial metabolism, under the control of the slr <dig> regulator. the "yin" atp-sparing downregulation of cell metabolism likely limits cd uptake and poisoning incorporation in place of the cognate metal cofactor of metalloenzymes. the compensatory "yang" breakdown of the photosynthetic machinery that impairs atp production, liberates nutrient assimilates that become available for the synthesis of cd-toxicity protecting enzymes, among which we found the slr <dig> arsenate reductase.

RESULTS
transcriptional regulations elicited by cd are slower and more sustained than those triggered by h2o2
the transcriptome approach was used to characterize the kinetics of global changes in synechocystis pcc <dig>  gene expression elicited by noxious agents, which were continuously applied to the cells to mimic the persistent character of stresses encountered in nature. exponentially growing cells were exposed to cdso <dig>  or h2o <dig>  for increasing periods of time that triggered a wide range of changes in cellular viability  and regulation , as required for a thorough investigation of stress responses . for each time point, total rna were isolated from stressed and unstressed cells, reverse-transcribed, differentially labeled , hybridized together  and analyzed with dna glass microarrays , as described in methods. our data  showed that the cd-elicited regulation could be divided in two main temporal phases. the early phase was moderate since only  <dig> genes responded to cd during the first  <dig> min of treatment, and the changes were mostly up-regulation. the second phase occurring between  <dig> to  <dig> min of treatment was massive, with about  <dig>  responsive genes equally distributed between up- and down-regulated genes. the relevance of the "early" and "massive" phases of cd responses was verified by performing an independent biological repeat of both the time points  <dig> min  and  <dig> min , and using an appropriate statistical test  to analyze all data . indeed, a large number of the cd-regulated genes  appeared to be differentially expressed between the two temporal phases of responses.

wild type cells were challenged for the indicated durations prior to survival and transcriptome analyses . in the case of the fe starvation stress, the switch in fe concentration is indicated as 1- <dig>  or 2- <dig> . the time point  <dig> min of the kinetic of cd responses was repeated twice  with the two different versions of the cyanochip dna microarrays, leading to very reproducible results .

genes were considered differentially regulated whenever their level of expression was changed at least  <dig>  fold.

by contrast, the transcriptional responses to h2o <dig>  were faster and briefer than those to cd . the massive phase of h2o2-mediated regulation encompassed the time points  <dig> min and  <dig> min , while the late phase occurred between  <dig> min and  <dig> min , a time period in which most fast-responsive genes had returned to normal expression level .

cadmium antagonistically controls the genes operating in protein synthesis , and protein maturation and degradation 
among the earliest responses to cd  was the upregulation  of chaperones and proteases genes, the number of which increased during the massive phase of responses . this regulation was accompanied with the downregulation of most ribosomal proteins genes , and, comforting our data, we noticed that operonic genes were co-regulated. by contrast, most aminoacyl-trna synthetases genes were unaffected by cd . considering the normal level of expression  <cit>  and the response to cd  of aminoacyl-trna synthetases genes  and ribosomal proteins genes , we think that cd-challenged cells preferentially downregulate those genes whose expression represents a metabolic burden. this interpretation is comforted by the findings that photosynthesis genes normally expressed to a high level  <cit>  were also turned down by cd .

similarly, h2o <dig> downregulated ribosomal protein genes , and did not affect aminoacyl-trna synthetase genes .

also interestingly, we found that zn excess partly mimics the cd-mediated control of genes involved in protein folding and turnover  or protein synthesis , which were little affected by fe availability .

cd and to a lesser extent h2o <dig> downregulate photosynthesis genes
a very important target of cd toxicity was the photosynthesis  machinery that uses several electron-transfer complexes, the photosystemii  and its phycobilisomes  antennae, the cytochrome b6/f, the photosystemi  and the atpase, to produce atp and nadph  <cit>  required for the assimilation of inorganic nutrients. in addition, the ps activity can also generate toxic reactive oxygen species  in case of light excess  <cit> . most of these ps genes were downregulated after 75â€“ <dig> min. of cd challenge . the validity of these data was substantiated by the observed co-regulation of the following operons psaab, psbcd <dig>  apcabc and atpihgfdacbe. in addition, we also observed the well-known  <cit>  antagonistic iron regulation of the ssl <dig> ferredoxin gene  and isib flavodoxin gene . furthermore, we have verified the cd-elicited downregulation of the psac gene at the level of protein abundance . also consistent with the cd-elicited downregulation of ps genes, we found  that cd  repressed most pigment synthesis genes, namely: hema, heml, hemb, heme, hemf, hemn, chln, chlb, chll, por, ho <dig>  ho <dig>  cbix, crth, crtr, crtd-homolog and alg-homolog, and  induced the nbla operonic genes that operate in pbs degradation  <cit> .

the global downregulation of ps and pigment synthesis genes has been observed in cells challenged by a high light stress  <cit>  and, very interestingly, we noticed that many of the high light-inducible genes  <cit>  were also upregulated by cd  namely: hlib, hlic, isia and nbla. collectively, these findings suggested that cd-exposed cells become light sensitive, an interpretation we validated through growth assays .

the aspects of cd toxicity resembling light stress are presumably due to oxidative stress since they could be elicited by h2o <dig> too . these common responses included the downregulation of all atpase genes and several pbs genes , as well as the concomitant upregulation of many high light-inducible genes . unsurprisingly, h2o <dig> mimicked high light stress that generates ros  <cit>  more efficiently than cd. indeed , h2o <dig> upregulated several high light-inducible genes unaffected by cd, namely: hlia, hlid, ctpa and ftsh  the protease genes involved in the high-light induced turnover of the d <dig> protein of psii  <cit> . also interestingly, many ps genes downregulated by cd were actually upregulated by h2o <dig>  namely: psii , psi  and pbs  .

in agreement with the upregulation of many genes induced by high light that triggers oxidative stress, we found  that cd and/or h2o <dig> upregulated many anti-oxidant genes encoding thioredoxin reductase , thioredoxins , glutathione peroxidase , glutaredoxins , glyoxalases  and peroxidases .

similarly to cd, zn downregulated numerous ps genes , and upregulated genes involved in protein turnover and tolerance to light/oxidative stress . by contrast, fe controlled a few ps genes.

also interestingly, the differential regulation of the cytochrome b6/f genes , encoding the predominant  or accessory  rieske iron-sulfur proteins  <cit> , strongly suggests that alternative b6/f complexes are synthesized in response to changing environmental conditions.

spectroscopic confirmation that cd elicits a more intense decline of the photosynthetic machinery than h2o2
that cd- and zn-excess turned down most photosynthesis genes and simultaneously upregulated protein degradation genes, suggested to us that these stresses decrease the abundance of the ps machinery. by comparison, we anticipated h2o <dig> to elicit a lower decline of the ps apparatus, in downregulating a smaller number of ps genes . these predictions were all validated by another global method i.e. absorption-spectroscopy, which showed that the cellular content of colored ps pigments was decreased strongly in response to cd- and zn-stresses  and weakly in response to h2o <dig> . as control experiments, we have verified that excess of fe  or cobalt did not alter pigments content .

oxygen evolution confirmation that cd impairs photosynthesis
to further demonstrate that cd impairs photosynthesis we measured the rate of the whole photosynthetic electron transport  of intact cells incubated with or without  <dig> Î¼m cd. as expected, the oxygen-evolving activity of cd-treated cells was strongly decreased  as compared to that of untreated cells.

cd and h2o <dig> likely disturb metal homeostasis
cd rapidly and continuously altered expression of numerous metal transport genes, indicating that it disturbs metal homeostasis . for instance, all members of the nine genes cluster involved in the tolerance to ni , co  and zn  were upregulated by cd. as one of the numerous findings attesting the relevance of our transcriptome data we observed  that zn controlled the genes znua  and ziaa , as expected  <cit> . that cd regulated both znua  and ziaa , whose product is homologous to the cd-transporting atpase cada  <cit> , suggesting that cd might be transported via zn transport systems. cd also controlled the corr-cort divergon operating in co efflux, as well as the cbi cluster and the cbix gene involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin the co-dependent vitamin b <dig>  <cit> . these data suggest that cd disturbs co homeostasis and utilization.

a large part of the numerous genes  dedicated to fe acquisition  were found to be positively regulated by fe starvation and turned down by fe excess , in agreement with previous northern blot data  <cit> . again, attesting the relevance of our data, we also observed the fe starvation-mediated control  of the isiab operon  and the fed <dig> genes , as expected  <cit> .

h2o <dig> upregulated all fe acquisition genes , as well as  the suf genes involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis  <cit> . these findings are reminiscent to what occurs in e. coli where oxidative-stressed cells induce fe uptake and suf genes to accelerate the supply of fe atoms for the reconstitution of damaged iron-sulfur clusters, in a process leaving no free fe atoms available for the toxic fenton chemistry  <cit> . interestingly, cd upregulated antioxidant and suf genes, as well as half the number of the fe-uptake genes . these findings suggest that cd damages fe-s centers, and that the extra fe atoms required for their repair might be provided not only by the presumably moderate increase in fe uptake, but also by the breakdown of the fe-rich photosynthetic machinery  that contains 21â€“ <dig> iron atoms per ps unit  <cit> .

iron availability controls the cd-elicited decline of cell viability and ps machinery
the above-mentioned data led us to predict that fe availability can influence not only cell tolerance to h2o <dig> and cd, but also the cd-elicited decline of the ps machinery. as anticipated, we found that the addition of fe in the medium at the onset of the stresses increased cell resistance to h2o <dig> and cd , and prevented the cd-elicited decline of the ps machinery . as a negative control, we verified that cobalt  was unable to mimic these fe-mediated protection effects .

the slr <dig> arsenate reductase contributes to cadmium tolerance
we noticed that the arsbhc tricistronic operon  operating in arsenic resistance  <cit>  was rapidly and continuously upregulated by cd . to confirm that the arsc arsenate-reductase enzyme is a key factor in the tolerance to cadmium, we have deleted the arsc gene , and found the corresponding fully-viable arsc null mutant to be more sensitive to cd than the wt strain .

cd and h2o <dig> downregulate carbon metabolism genes, many of which encode atp-requiring enzymes
most co <dig> concentrating mechanism  genes for the acquisition and assimilation of inorganic carbon   <cit>  were downregulated by cd , namely:  the ndhf <dig>  ndhd <dig> and cupa tricistronic operon ;  the ndhf <dig> and ndhd <dig> operon and the cupb gene ;  the cmpabcd operon ;  the sbtab operon ;  the cca gene ;  the carboxysome genes ccmk <dig> and ccmk-n operon;  the prk gene  and  the ppc gene . these results, together with the constitutive expression of the low-ci inducible gene ndhr encoding the ci-assimilation regulator  <cit> , indicate that cd challenged cells are not suffering from ci starvation. similarly, most carbon metabolism genes were turned down by cd , namely:  gpma ;  eno ;  pyk <dig> ;  pgk ;  gap <dig> ;  glgc  involved in glycogen synthesis;  pgm ;  pfka ;  fbpi ;  fbaa ;  pdhabcd ;  icd .

collectively, these data suggest that cd downregulates citrate synthesis and conversion into 2-oxoglutarate that connects carbon and nitrogen assimilation pathways. this prediction was substantiated by the cd-mediated downregulation of numerous genes operating in nitrogen metabolism .

very interestingly, we noticed that many of the carbon metabolism genes downregulated by cd code for atp-consuming enzymes such as cmpabcd, fbpi, pgk, pfka, prk and pyk <dig>  this negative regulation can be viewed as a part of a global atp-sparing response to the cd stress .

similarly to cd, h2o <dig> downregulated many ci acquisition genes : ccm, cmp and sbt, as well and numerous carbon metabolism genes: pgk, gpmb , eno, fbpi, cara, carb, pdha, pdhb, pdhc and pdhd. by contrast, fe and zn downregulated a few ci acquisition genes such as cmp and sbt  and ccm , and had very little influence on carbon metabolism genes.

cd and h2o <dig> downregulate nitrogen metabolism genes, many of which encode atp-consuming enzymes
most genes for the acquisition and assimilation of nitrogen were negatively regulated by both cd and h2o <dig> , namely:  amt <dig> and amt <dig> ;  nrtabcd operon ;  urtabc ;  narb ;  nira ;  glna and glnn ;  muri ;  argb ,  cpha ;  hema, hemf and heml . consistent with the downregulation of the glutamine synthase glna gene we found that both cd and h2o <dig> upregulate the gifa and gifb genes, which code for an inhibitor of glna activity  <cit> . in addition a few related genes were specifically downregulated by either cd , or h2o <dig>  the latter were the following:  urea and uref ;  carab ;  glsf ;  arg ;  argh ;  cpha ; and : proa .

together, our data strongly show that synechocystis challenged with h2o <dig> or cd downregulates numerous key genes encoding atp-consuming enzymes involved in nitrogen acquisition and metabolisms. this finding is consistent with the above-mentioned negative regulation of atp-requiring mechanisms for carbon assimilation and metabolism, and global protein synthesis . we view these downregulations as an atp-sparing process aimed at compensating the decline in atp production caused by the negative regulation of atpase and photosynthesis genes.

fe  regulated numerous n acquisition and assimilation genes, suggesting that fe homeostasis and nitrogen assimilation are intrinsically connected.

cd and h2o <dig> downregulate the two sulfur assimilation genes encoding atp-dependent enzymes
very interestingly, the genes met <dig>  and cysc  encoding the two atp-requiring enzymes of the cysteine-synthesis pathway appeared to be downregulated by both cd and h2o <dig> . these data substantiate the cd- and h2o2-elicited downregulation of atp-consuming metabolic enzymes mentioned above.

prominent role of the slr <dig> regulator in the transcriptional responses and survival to cd
to demonstrate that the cd-elicited breakdown of the photosynthetic  machinery  is a direct physiological response rather than a side effect of cell damage, we searched for a regulator controlling this breakdown process with the view that its inactivation in interfering with the ps decline should decrease the level of tolerance to cd. hence, we became interested in the slr <dig> transcription regulator gene because it is upregulated by cd , a finding which suggests that slr <dig> might be involved in the responses to cd. we have deleted the slr <dig> gene  and found the corresponding slr <dig> null-mutant  to be fully viable in standard growth conditions , in agreement with the small number of genes with an altered level of expression . as expected, the Î”slr <dig> mutant was found to be less resistant to cd than the wt strain , indicating that slr <dig> mediates some of the cd-elicited regulations. to characterize the slr1738-mediated responses to cd, we used dna microarrays to identify the genes whose transcript abundance in cd-treated cells differed at least twofold between the Î”slr <dig> mutant and the wt strain. as expected, we found that the cd-elicited downregulation of ps genes  and the simultaneous upregulation of the nbla genes operating in phycobilisomes  degradation were all impaired in the slr <dig> null mutant . these findings were confirmed through absorption-spectroscopy analyses of the cellular content of ps proteins. as expected, the cd-elicited decline of pigmented proteins was truly lower in the Î”slr <dig> mutant than in the wt strain . the cd-elicited downregulation of the genes coding for ribosomal proteins was also impaired in the Î”slr <dig> mutant . slr <dig> was also found to contribute to the cd-mediated upregulation of the suf genes involved in fe-s cluster assembly and repair , and the ars genes operating in tolerance to arsenic and cadmium .

by contrast, slr <dig> is likely not involved in the cd-mediated regulation of carbon metabolism , indicating that other cd response regulator remain to be identified.

finally, the Î”slr <dig> mutant appeared to be more resistant to h2o <dig> and paraquat than the wt strain . this phenotype, unnoticed by previous workers  <cit> , is consistent with the increased level of expression of various antioxidant genes  such as the sll <dig> peroxiredoxin gene  <cit>  and the sequence homology between slr <dig> and the b. subtilis perr  regulator whose inactivation increases the resistance to oxidative stress  <cit> .

discussion
photosynthetic organisms that support much of the biosphere are increasingly challenged by heavy metals, which are persistent in the environment since they cannot be degraded. using the model cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc <dig> as the host, we have performed a thorough multidisciplinary analysis of the global responses of photosynthetic cells to cadmium , as well as to hydrogen peroxide  and noxious concentrations of the essential metals iron and zinc because the disturbance of metal homeostasis can generate oxidative stress  <cit> . the presently reported data on the global responses to both the cd and zn stresses are novel. in the case of the h2o <dig> and fe stresses our data confirmed and extended those obtained previously after less-extensive investigations. in the case of the h2o <dig> stress, the novelty of our report is that our temporal analysis made it possible to discriminate between early and late responses, unlike the previously performed single time-point analysis  <cit> . concerning the fe-starvation stress, we choose to study the responses to a continuous fe limitation because stresses occurring in nature are durable, whereas singh and co-workers studied cells recovering from a transient fe deficiency  <cit> . this presumably explains the fact that we observed the induction of a larger number of fe acquisition genes than the previous workers. furthermore, unlike previous workers we also studied the response to fe excess to identify those genes oppositely responding to excess and deficiency of fe, which are therefore likely responding to fe per se rather than to another indirect stress signal.

the presently reported occurrence of two temporal phases in the responses to cd and h2o <dig>  with a stress-specific timing, emphasizes on the value of kinetic analyses of stress responses especially when they are to be compared. indeed, one cannot assume that two stresses of equal duration and toxicity have the same biological effects, in term of gene regulation. this important fact is illustrated by our findings that cells challenged with cd  or h2o <dig>  for the same period of time  leading to equal lethality  displayed massive responses to h2o <dig> but only moderate  responses to cd in term of the number of the genes regulated .

the biological significance of the genome-wide transcriptional responses to all presently tested stresses  was validated using relevant assays  performed with appropriate metal doses that varied with the number of cells to be treated, and/or attested by the following evidences. first, in every case all gene members of the same operon were found to be co-regulated. second, all fe- and zn-acquisition genes responded the expected way to the availability of their cognate metal. third, most of the dispersed genes encoding the protein-subunits of the same complex were found to be co-regulated, as observed for instance in the case of the photosynthesis  genes . fourth, in agreement with the cd-mediated downregulation of most genes ps and the concomitant upregulation of protein-degradation genes , we showed that cd decreases both the abundance  and activity  of the ps machinery. fifth, consistent with the cd-elicited induction of the arsenate reductase gene arsc  we showed that arsc operates in cd tolerance . thus, the arsc enzyme has a great biotechnological potential in contributing to the tolerance to two widespread persistent pollutants: arsenic and cadmium. possibly the arsc enzyme, which employed glutathione  and glutaredoxin as reductants  <cit> , could somehow "sequester" cd in generating an hypothetical gsh-cd complex less toxic than cd. sixth, as inferred from the cd-elicited upregulation of numerous high light-inducible genes  we showed that cd decreases the tolerance to light . seventh, as anticipated from its cd-elicited induction  we demonstrated that the slr <dig> regulator mediates several responses that are crucial to protection against cd, such as the decline of the ps machinery and the upregulation of the arsc gene .

the occurrence of large clusters of co-regulated genes, encoding ribosome, atpase or fe uptake proteins, suggests a mechanism of global control of gene expression involving chromosomal structure, similarly to chromatin remodeling in eukaryotic cells. this prediction is comforted by the findings  that the synechocystis hu and dps nucleoprotein genes, possibly involved in such structure-dependent global regulation  <cit> , are regulated by cd , positively  or negatively .

many of our data support the notion of metal selectivity. for examples,  fe but not zn mimicked the cd-mediated downregulation of n acquisition and assimilation genes ; and  zn but not fe mimicked the cd-mediated decline of the ps machinery  and the downregulation of ribosomal genes which is therefore not a general stress response. by contrast, numerous genes responded the same way to cd, fe, zn and h2o <dig> , suggesting that reactive oxygen species might act in signal transduction of stress responses, as proposed  <cit> .

both h2o <dig> and cd were found to upregulate numerous genes operating in tolerance to oxidative stress  and to the related high light stress  that also generates toxic reactive oxygen species   <cit> . these findings, which were anticipated in the case of the h2o <dig> stress, were confirmed by showing that both h2o <dig> and cd render cells light sensitive . in addition, both h2o <dig> and cd upregulated the suf genes  involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis or repair  <cit>  and the fe uptake genes . consistently, we found that increasing the concentration of fe in the medium increases the cell tolerance to both h2o <dig> and cd . these results are reminiscent to what occurs in oxidative-stressed e. coli cells  <cit> . they suggest that synechocystis challenged with either h2o <dig> or cd accelerates fe uptake strongly  or moderately  to provide extra fe atoms for the repair of damaged fe-s clusters. having also noticed that cd triggers a larger breakdown of the fe-rich ps machinery than h2o <dig> , we believe that cells challenged with h2o <dig> or cd use two strategies to provide extra fe atoms to the machinery that synthesizes or repairs fe-s centers. h2o2-treated cells undergoing a limited ps-decline  mostly accelerate the intake of fe from the medium, while cd-stressed cells that moderately increase fe intake breakdown a part of their abundant ps machinery , which normally contains 21â€“ <dig> fe atoms per ps unit  <cit> . consequently, we predicted, and confirmed, that increasing the availability of fe limits the cd-elicited decline of the ps-machinery .

many of the key genes involved in acquisition and metabolism of c, n and s that were downregulated by cd and h2o <dig> are coding for atp-consuming enzymes . these responses can be viewed as an atp-sparing process used by the cells to compensate for the decreased production of atp caused by the decline of the ps apparatus  or of the respiration machinery . similarly, the downregulation of ribosomal genes  encoding normally abundant proteins  <cit>  triggered by cells facing cd and h2o <dig> is likely aimed at sparing c, n and s nutrients to compensate for the downregulation of the corresponding acquisition and assimilation genes.

based on the presently reported findings, we view the responses to a continuous cd stress as a two temporal-phases process. in the early phase occurring during the first  <dig> min of exposure , cd-stressed cells regulate mainly the genes operating in metal transport  and protein maturation and degradation . these responses presumably limit cd entry into the cells and incorporation in place of the cognate metal cofactor of metalloproteins. in prolonged exposures , these regulations are conserved, and even amplified in term of the number of responsive processes, thereby defining the next phase designated as "massive" for this reason. at this stage, the responses to cd can be viewed as an integrated "yin yang" reprogramming of the whole cellular metabolism. as the yin process, most key genes operating in uptake and assimilation of inorganic nutrients  and protein synthesis are turned down. these responses allow  the sparing of both energy  and reducing power h) normally consumed by nutrient assimilation and subsequent metabolism, and  the limitation of the poisoning incorporation of cd in metalloenzymes. as the compensatory yang process, the ps breakage of the ps machinery, which decreases the production of both atp and nadph, liberates fe and c, n and s nutrient assimilates that can be recycled into the synthesis of cd-tolerance enzymes such as the arsc arsenate reductase  and, presumably, other cd-inducible enzymes: suf proteins , flavodoxin , ferredoxin , flavoproteins , glutathione peroxidase , peroxiredoxin , thioredoxin , hydrogenase subunits  and the ziaa . furthermore, other new cd-tolerance enzymes might be discovered in the future, among the product of the orphan genes which apperaed to be upregulated by cd . we showed that the cd-induced slr <dig> regulator  plays a central role in the protection against cd  in mediating several of the important regulations, such as the breakage of the ps machinery, the downregulation of ribosomal genes, and the upregulation of the arsc arsenate reductase and suf genes.

CONCLUSIONS
using the cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc <dig> as a model organism, we analyzed the global responses of environmentally important cells to stresses triggered by cd , h2o <dig> , or drastic changes in fe availability, which appeared to modulate the tolerance to cd and h2o <dig>  our results indicate that cells challenged with h2o <dig> or cd use different strategies for the same purpose of increasing the supply of fe atoms to the synthesis and repair of fe-requiring metalloenzymes. while h2o2-challenged cells preferentially accelerate fe intake, cd-stressed cells preferentially breakdown the fe-rich ps machinery to liberate fe atoms. we view the responses to cd as an integrated "yin yang" metabolic reprogramming. as the "yin" process, the atp- and nutrients-sparing downregulation of anabolism limits the poisoning incorporation of cd into metalloenzymes. as the compensatory "yang" process, the ps breakdown liberates nutrient assimilates for the synthesis of cd-tolerance proteins. we found that this reprogramming is mediated by the slr <dig> transcriptional regulator that also operates in oxidative stress tolerance, in agreement with its sequence homology with the peroxide resistance regulator of bacillus subtilis. further studies will be necessary to understand the influence of cd and h2o <dig> on the activity of slr <dig>
