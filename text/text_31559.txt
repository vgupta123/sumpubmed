BACKGROUND
s100b protein is a ca2+, cu2+ and zn2+ binding member of the s100-calmodulin-troponin superfamily and is primarily found in high abundance within the nervous system  <cit> .

 <dig> kda homodimers are the predominant form in which the protein exists within cells. a number of intracellular growth-associated target proteins have been revealed, such as growth-associated protein  <dig> , the regulatory domain of protein kinase c , the anti-apoptotic factor bcl- <dig> or the tumour suppressor protein p <dig>  <cit> . s100b has also been found to regulate protein ubiquitination via interaction with sgt <dig>  <cit>  and regulate the assembly of cytoskeleton components such as microtubules, glial fibrillary acidic protein  or vimentin  <cit> .

however, s100b is not only implicated in the regulation of intracellular processes, but, it is also a secretory protein and exhibits cytokine-like activities, which mediate the interactions among glial cells and between glial cells and neurones. these effects are induced, in part, by interaction of s100b with the receptor for advanced glycation end products , a multiligand receptor that has been shown to transduce inflammatory stimuli and effects of several neurotrophic and neurotoxic factors  <cit> . secretion of s100b from astrocytes is stimulated under metabolic stress  and is suppressed by glutamate  <cit> . s100b acts in a dose-dependent manner: nanomolar levels stimulate neurite growth and promote neurone survival. however, micromolar levels result in opposite effects and can even induce neuronal apoptosis, leading to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin1β  or tumour necrosis factor α , and inflammatory stress-related enzymes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase   <cit> .

high levels of s100b in cerebrospinal fluid  and peripheral blood have been observed in clinical research on alzheimer's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, meningoencephalitis, mood disorders and schizophrenia  <cit> . elevated levels of s100b have been increasingly considered a biomarker for astrocytic damage or dysfunction in this context. this may have arisen from several postmortem studies on alzheimer's disease and down's syndrome describing predominant s100b immunostaining in reactive astrocytes surrounding neuritic plaques  <cit> . other studies on the cell-type specificity of s100b in human brain are rare  <cit> . the cell-type specific localization of s100b in white matter has been minimally studied in human brain. however, higher contents of s <dig> have been found in white matter homogenates relative to cortex homogenates by the discoverer of the protein family  <cit> .

in addition, it is sometimes overlooked that s100b containing cell types have also been identified outside the central nervous system and there are physiological stimuli for a release of s100b into the serum or csf, which are not related to central nervous system diseases. examples are physical exercise  <cit> , stress  <cit> , fasting  <cit> , critically ill patients  <cit> , cardiac arrest  <cit>  and extracranial injuries  <cit>  without brain injury.

the aim of the present work was to analyze the immunohistochemical distribution of s100b in adult human brain. we investigated telencephalic and diencephalic regions, including white matter of  <dig> healthy adults, to evaluate the cell-type specificity of s100b.

RESULTS
western blot analysis
using the s100b antibody obtained from dako, we observed a single strong band with a molecular mass of about  <dig> kda, representing the authentic molecule, in human adult brain . this is in accordance with the immunoblotting analysis performed by the manufacturer of the antibody  using recombinant s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  where no cross-reaction with other s <dig> proteins was observed.

preabsorption
no specific immunostaining was observed after preabsorption of the s100b antibody with the recombinant human-s100b protein.

immunohistochemistry
the differential s100b- and gfap-immunostaining pattern is summarized in table  <dig> and  <dig>  gfap immunohistochemistry selectively labelled astrocytes and their processes , showed only faint ependymal immunopositivity and was negative in the choroid plexus epithelium . in contrary, a less uniform staining pattern was seen in the case of s100b. cells with astrocytic morphology in the human cortex primarily stained positive for s100b, while only 20%  or 14%  of all immunopositive cells showed oligodendrocytic morphology in the dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortex, respectively. in the white matter, however, most immunostained cells resembled oligodendrocytes . both gfap- and s100b-immunostaining were seen in the subependymal layer and the perivascular  compartment and the perivascular membrane formed by astrocytic endfeet . of note, we observed strong s100b immunopositivity of the ependymal and choroids plexus epithelia . in addition, s100b was also found in a few neurones and a subpopulation of lymphocytes . by contrast, gfap expression was detected neither in neurones nor in lymphocytes by the monoclonal antibody. the intracellular localization also varied: s100b was found in the nucleus and cytoplasm whereas gfap was confined to the cytoplasm.

double immunolabelling and immunofluorescence staining
double immunolabelling revealed a distinct subpopulation of cells with astrocytic morphology, which were either positive for s100b or gfap, or expressed both antigens . some of these were a2b5-immunopositive o2a glial progenitor cells . s100b-positive fibres were also observed, which correspond to myelinated fibers as shown by double immunolabelling for s100b and mbp . oligodendrocytic s100b expression was confirmed by co-localization with mog . however, no microglial s100b immunolabelling was observed by hla-dr double immunostaining .

 <dig>  discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the cell-type specific localization of s100b in the brain has already been investigated in various species, including mouse, rat, cat, and lizard  <cit> . these studies found s100b in all glial cells, including astrocytes, ependymal cells, oligodendrocytes, microglial and schwann cells. studies on the cell-type specific expression of s100b in human brain are rare, but astrocytic and oligodendrocytic expression have been observed  <cit> . immunohistochemical postmortem studies on s100b in human temporal cortex in alzheimer's disease and down's syndrome may have led to the assumption that s100b is an astrocyte-specific marker   <cit> . this is in accordance with our findings on grey matter, indicating a predominantly astrocytic s100b expression pattern in the dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortex of individuals without neurological or psychiatric disorders. however the majority of s100b immunopositive cells in the white matter resembled oligodendrocytes, which is in accordance with an early publication by moore et al.  who observed a higher content of s <dig> in white matter homogenates relative to cortical homogenates  <cit> . it has been demonstrated in rodents that s100b is primarily confined to immature oligodendrocytes, which may be activated in the context of a regenerative myelination processes  <cit> . deloulme et al.  <cit>  detected s100b protein in up to 40% of mbp-positive oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum of mice and rickmann et al.  <cit>  found an association of s100b with paranodal loops and outer mesaxons of myelin sheaths in rats by electron microscopic immunohistochemistry.

microglial staining has only been detected in the rat by adami et al. so far, but has not been observed in our present study on human brain  <cit> . our study is the first reporting of a small subpopulation of s100b containing neurones in human brain tissue. this is in accordance with findings in the mouse  <cit>  and rat  <cit> , but is in contrary to li et al., who was unable to detect s100b immunopositive neurones in adult human brain  <cit> . using a different antibody  and the absence of antigen demasking techniques in the study by li et al. might explain these different observations, as the importance of antigen retrieval methods to detect s100b immunopositive neurones has already been addressed by yang et al. in mice  <cit> .

interestingly, the ependyma and the choroid plexus epithelia were strongly s100b immunopositive in our study as previously noted in the rat  <cit> . the surface ependyma is known to express epithelial markers and faint gfap-staining. it is considered to be developmentally related to astrocytes, while the choroid plexus epithelium is a specialized ependyma, which differs from the surface ependyma: vimentin, cytokeratin and s100b continue to be expressed, but gfap is not expressed  <cit> . thus, the observed distribution pattern of s100b in the present study on human brain completely matches that reported in mouse and rat, indicating that cellular function might be very similar among mammalians.

our study reveals a subpopulation of cells with astrocytic morphology, which were only immunopositive for s100b but not for gfap. one explanation might be that some cells with astrocytic morphology were s100b- and a2b5-immunopositive o2a glial progenitor cells, which do not express gfap  <cit> .

in conclusion, s100b is a less astrocyte-specific marker than gfap. therefore, it should not be generally assumed that astrocytic damage or dysfunction is the main source for increased s100b concentrations in the case of studies with plasma, serum or cerebrospinal fluid. s100b may also be released during non-astrocyte cell death as it is also localized in o2a glial progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, ependymal and plexus epithelial cells and neurones. in addition, s100b protein has also been noted outside the central nervous system. immunocytochemical studies detected s100b in 5–25% of cd8+ peripheral blood t cells  <cit> , in adipose tissue, melanocytes, injured myocardium, satellite cells of dorsal root ganglia and schwann-cells of the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . there is little information about the functional implications, but all these cell types are potential sources for s100b in serum.

in contrast, only minor sources of gfap have been detected outside the central nervous system. traces of gfap have been found in the peripheral nervous system, macrophages, lymphocytes, lens epithelial cells, and few human breast myoepithelial cells  <cit> . moreover, the peripheral gfap is a shorter protein version and may be antigenically and structurally different, as monoclonal anti-brain gfap antibodies have failed to recognize peripheral gfap  <cit> .

in summary, serum and csf s100b, different from gfap, has many putative cellular sources. this is important to avoid misinterpretation of normal and pathological cell type identifications in situ and in clinical studies since s100b is continuously used as an astrocytic marker in animal models and various human diseases.

 <dig>  methods
human brain tissue for western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining
the brain of a  <dig> year old woman  was removed from the cranium within  <dig> hrs after death, dissected into small pieces, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored.

human brain tissue for immunohistochemistry
postmortem brain tissue of  <dig> individuals without neurological or psychiatric disorders was used for the present study . all brains were obtained from the magdeburg brain collection. the collection of the human brain material was done in accordance with german laws and the rules outlined by the local ethics committee. brains were removed within  <dig> hrs after death. the tissue preparation was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, brains were fixed in toto in 8% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde  for  <dig> months. after embedding the brains in paraplast, serial coronal  <dig> μm thick whole brain sections were cut on a microtome and mounted. for immunohistochemical staining, sections about  <dig> cm rostral to the genu of the corpus callosum and sections containing the hippocampus, as well as thalamus and lateral ventricles at the level of the mamillary bodies were selected.

blood smears from two healthy subjects were stained for s100b for closer identification of s100b immunopositive white blood cells, which were found in the vessels of brain sections. the blood smears were fixed in methanol for  <dig> h.

western blot analysis
frozen tissue samples from the temporal cortex and cerebellum was homogenized in lysis buffer , and incubated on ice for  <dig> minutes. after centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> minutes, the supernatant was collected to measure the total protein content. protein concentration was measured by bradford assay, with bsa as standard. twenty micrograms of protein were loaded on 10% sds-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis. after separation, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane  at  <dig> ma for  <dig> hours. western blot analysis was done after blocking the membrane with 5% skim milk in tbst buffer for  <dig> hour. the membrane was incubated with the specific s100b antibody at 4°c overnight . the membrane was washed four times in tbst buffer. secondary detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g . after four washings with tbst, horseradish peroxidase activity was visualized by applying enhanced chemiluminescent substrate  followed by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film.

immunohistochemistry – single staining
neighbouring sections were used for s100b or gfap single-staining. formalin-fixed tissue sections were deparaffinized and antigen demasking was performed by boiling the sections for  <dig> min in  <dig> mm citrate buffer . preincubation with  <dig> % h2o <dig> for  <dig> min to block endogenous peroxidase activity was followed by blocking of nonspecific binding sites with 10% normal goat serum for  <dig> min and repeated washings with pbs. the primary antibody was diluted in pbs and applied for  <dig> h at 4°c , dilution 1:100). thereafter, sections were processed with the lsab  method  and the reaction product was visualized with  <dig> -diaminobenzidine. the colour reaction of the s100b staining was enhanced by adding  <dig> ml of a  <dig> %  nickel ammonium sulphate solution to the diaminobenzidine  <cit> . preabsorption: specificity of the s100b immunoreaction was controlled by preabsorption of  <dig> ml antibody working dilution with  <dig>  mg recombinant human-s100b  for  <dig> h. no specific staining was observed after preabsorption with the protein. double staining: anti s100b primary antibody was applied for  <dig> h at 4°c. thereafter, sections were incubated with envision labelled polymer  and the reaction product was visualized with liquid permanent red . subsequent gfap immunostaining was performed according to the single-staining protocol after antibody elution with  <dig>  m glycine-hcl for  <dig> min . counterstaining was performed with 50%  harris haematoxylin solution  for  <dig> s.

immunofluorescence staining
a tissue sample from the temporal cortex and adjacent white matter was fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde  at 4°c overnight, cryoprotected in a solution of 30% sucrose  in  <dig> % buffered paraformaldehyde  for  <dig> days, and rapidly frozen at -20°c using 2-methylbutane . serial sagittal  <dig> μm thick sections were cut on a cryostat .

free-floating sections were washed and incubated with the corresponding antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-recombinant human s100b , monoclonal mouse anti-myelin basic protein , monoclonal mouse anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein , monoclonal mouse anti-a2b <dig> , or monoclonal mouse anti-human hla-dr-alpha-chain  in pbs with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> and 1% normal goat serum overnight at 4°c. following this, slices were washed in pbs  and incubated overnight with a combination of secondary antibodies : goat anti-rabbit-igg alexa fluor  <dig> or goat anti-mouse-igg alexa fluor  <dig>  sections were examined using a fluorescence microscope  equipped with fluorescein, rhodamine and dapi optics. control reactions  yielded negative results, i.e. no specific immunostaining was seen in these sections.

cytological classification
the cytological classification of immunopositive cells as neurones, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or microglia was performed according to established cytomorphological criteria  <cit> : neuronal nuclei are large, round with a single prominent nucleolus  and are surrounded by substantial cytoplasm. astrocytes have less cytoplasm surrounding large, more or less rounded nuclei and exhibit many star-shaped processes. fibrous astrocytes are found predominantly in the white matter; they possess numerous elongated processes. protoplasmic astrocytes are present among collections of neuronal cell bodies . their processes are less numerous and considerably more swollen in appearance than those of fibrous astrocytes. oligodendrocytes are associated with fibre tracts in typical "pearl necklet" alignment. they are small spheroid glial cells with round, lymphocyte-like nuclei, a small cytoplasmic rim and few processes .
