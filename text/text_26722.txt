BACKGROUND
mycobacterium bovis infections are of major importance in many developed and developing countries, including uganda  <cit> . in countries with national bovine tuberculosis eradication programmes, clinical evidence of tuberculosis in cattle is seldom encountered because the intradermal tuberculin test enables presumptive diagnosis and elimination of infected animals before signs appear  <cit> . studies have shown that in the final phases of eradication, strains of mycobacterium sp. outside the tuberculosis  complex may increase the relative frequency and cause false positive skin test reactions  <cit> . in countries without any control programme, including uganda, clinical symptoms and post mortem lesions associated with bovine tuberculosis  may still be seen  <cit> .

post mortem examination followed by bacteriological examination of suspected lesions in cattle are important tools to confirm the presence <cit> , while molecular studies help to characterise mycobacterial species involved  <cit> . histo-pathological examination may increase the specificity of the diagnosis and in circumstances where the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis is high, pathology can be relied on for diagnosis  <cit> . however, lesions due to an infection with other mycobacteria can be mistaken for bovine tuberculosis. when the prevalence is low, as in the latter stages of an eradication campaign or under extensive management systems, the need for definitive diagnosis becomes more important and routine culturing of all suspected lesions is recommended.

the combination of conventional methods and molecular typing of isolates have yielded important insights into the epidemiology of tuberculosis in domestic  <cit>  and wildlife populations  <cit> . it has permitted a more precise targeting and monitoring efficacy of conventional control measures  <cit> . it has also provided more precise information on the rate of transmission  <cit> , stability of the genetic profiles and has been used in epidemiological tracing  <cit> . a possible relationship exists between the genotype and phenotype of m. bovis and the disease pattern  <cit> . different genotypes may differ in pathogenicity and thereby affect the development of lesions and how the animals react to the tuberculin test. this suggests a linkage between immunogenicity with respect to the skin test and possibly transmissibility <cit> , which traditional approaches to tuberculosis diagnosis could not adequately explain.

different molecular tools have been developed to differentiate between mycobacterial isolates. notable are spoligotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphism  based molecular techniques <cit> . spoligotyping is designed to detect the presence or absence of unique spacers within the direct repeat  locus of the m. bovis genome. it is known to distinguish between phenotypically different strains and has been successfully used to type m. bovis isolates from different african countries such as nigeria <cit> , chad  <cit> , cameroon  <cit> , madagascar  <cit>  and tanzania  <cit> . spoligotyping has been performed on m. bovis isolates obtained from different animals to show the interaction between species. some spoligotypes have been associated with more sensitivity and specificity to tuberculin, virulence and transmissibility <cit> .

different insertion sequences -is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> rflp have been used to identify and differentiate members outside the tuberculosis complex group  <cit> . is <dig> rflphas been used to establish the relationship between m. avium complex strains isolated from birds, animals, humans, and the environment and virulence for poultry  <cit> . is <dig> rflp has low discriminatory power against m.a.subsp.avium but has been very important in the study of epidemiology of m. a. subsp.hominissuis  <cit> . a closely related is element is is <dig>  which shows 85% sequence identity with is <dig> at the dna level  <cit> . molecular typing of mot is important to identify groups previously thought not to play an important role in human and animal infections.

in uganda, pastoral communities live in close contact with their cattle. the presence of mycobacterial infections in cattle would represent a huge health risk to their owners. therefore, in endemic areas where bovine and human tuberculosis coexist, the isolation of m. bovis from cattle is important in order to prove its presence and thereby elucidate the risk of spreading the infection to humans  <cit> . there is little information available on agents causing lesions compatible with tuberculosis in slaughtered cattle in uganda  <cit> , yet recent studies have shown high herd and low animal prevalence of tuberculin reactors in pastoral areas  <cit> . the high avian or non-specific tuberculin reactor trends encountered in skin tests in pastoral areas made it necessary to provide information on the species of mycobacteria involved.

the aim of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterise mycobacterial species causing pathological lesions compatible with bovine tuberculosis in slaughtered cattle from pastoral areas in uganda.

RESULTS
thirty seven mycobacterial isolates were cultured from  <dig> samples collected from organs showing lesions compatible with bovine tuberculosis . mtc was detected in  <dig> of the samples;  <dig> isolates originated from tuberculous lesions  and five from localised lymph node lesions. due to the contamination of subcultures, only fifteen m. bovis isolates from this study and four additional m. bovis isolates collected from a parallel field study in cattle in the same areas were examined by spoligotyping, ten distinct spoligo patterns were identified. they were grouped into three clusters of >95% similarity . all isolates lacked spacers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 39– <dig> as most m. bovis isolates do and they also lacked spacers  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, members of the first cluster  lacked spacers  <dig> and  <dig>  they showed slight variations, as b- <dig> lacked spacer  <dig>  b- <dig> and b- <dig> lacked spacer  <dig> and b <dig> lacked spacer  <dig>  all members of the second cluster lacked spacers  <dig> and  <dig>  all except one  lacked spacer  <dig> and b- <dig> lacked spacer  <dig>  the nine members of the third cluster lacked spacers  <dig>   <dig> and 18– <dig>  in addition b- <dig>  b- <dig>  b- <dig>  b- <dig>  b- <dig>  b- <dig> and b- <dig> lacked spacers  <dig>  while b- <dig> also lacked spacers  <dig> and  <dig>  the samples were too few to establish any association between the spoligotypes and nature of the lesions they were isolated from.

mot were detected in  <dig> samples. of these, one isolate was identified on mac and m. avium accuprobes as m. intracellulare and two others as m. avium sp. most of the unidentified mycobacteria  were isolated from disseminated tuberculous lesions and only one was from a local lymph node . the two cases of mixed infections were isolated from disseminated tuberculosis lesions. of the three m. avium sp. examined by is <dig> and is <dig> rflp, two showed four bands on the is <dig> rflp while the last isolate showed  <dig> bands. all three isolates showed different patterns with  <dig> or  <dig> bands on is <dig> rflp and were identified as m. avium subsp. hominissuis  <cit>  .

discussion
different mycobacterial species were isolated in lesions compatible with bovine tuberculosis in pastoral slaughtered cattle in uganda. m. bovis was found in  <dig> % and mycobacteria outside the m. tuberculosis complex  in  <dig> % of the  <dig> samples where mycobacteria were detected. these results were comparable to the 42% isolation rate of m. bovis in mycobacteria positive cultures in chad  <cit> . this is the first study in uganda to document that other mycobacterial species are involved in cattle infections and also reports the spoligotypes of m. bovis involved. earlier identification studies were mainly based on colonial and biochemical characteristics  <cit> .

many thousands of cattle were examined during the nine month study period, still only  <dig> animals with macroscopic lesions compatible with bovine tuberculosis were detected. the low number of lesioned animals reflect the low prevalence of btb in uganda  <cit>  and probably also the low sensitivity of post mortem examinations  <cit> . however, the isolation of m. bovis from slaughtered cattle confirms that bovine tuberculosis is present in pastoral areas in the cattle corridor of mid-central and mid-western regions of uganda. as documented elsewhere in africa  <cit> , pastoralists in africa in general have an obsessive attachment to their cattle. their diet mostly of raw milk, fresh blood and occasionally meat could be regarded as potential sources of infection  <cit> . the isolation of m. bovis from their cattle should be considered a serious public health concern  <cit> . in endemic areas where bovine and human tuberculosis coexist, the documentation of the existing strains of m. bovis is important for monitoring the spread of m. bovis among cattle and between cattle and humans  <cit> . two of the m. bovis spoligotypes  isolated from slaughtered cattle were also isolated from  <dig> human cases of cervical lymphadenitis, in a parallel study in humans, though from different locations  <cit> . this documents an existing infection from cattle to humans and further highlights the potential threat of btb to humans in rural communities  <cit> .

owing to the difficulties encountered in tracking the origin of these cattle, it was not possible to link them to any specific geographic area. however, spoligotypes found in other african countries  <cit>  were not detected in uganda. comparison of the ugandan spoligotypes with the m. bovis database  <cit>  and tuberculosis database spoldb <dig>  <cit>  showed that these particular spoligotypes were unique and not documented elsewhere.

isolation of m. avium subsp. hominissuis and other mot in cattle with disseminated tuberculosis lesions could signify the importance of these bacteria in pastoral communities and their cattle. m. avium sp. hominissuis and other environmental mycobacteria have been isolated from swine, cattle, sheep, goats and horses  <cit> , wild and domestic birds  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . in contrast to m. avium subsp. avium infections in wild and domestic birds, these infections in mammals occur only sporadically and are rarely transmissible  <cit> . generalised disease due to mot is usually uncommon, owing to the non-progressive, chronic character of the infection. however, some cases of disseminated disease have been reported, especially in captive non-domestic hoofed animals and pigs  <cit> . the relatively high rate of isolation of mot  in the current study , calls for special attention. the isolation of mycobacteria mostly considered opportunistic or less virulent  <cit>  in conditions of disseminated tuberculosis with fully caseated and calcified lesions is documented elsewhere <cit> . however, mixed infections, as documented in other studies  <cit> , were observed in caseated and/or calcified disseminated lesions in this study. these findings could suggest secondary mycobacterial infections or may have outgrown the slow growing m. bovis during culture <cit> . isolation of mot in this study is consistent with earlier findings in pastoral areas, in which high avian and doubtful reactor trends were reported  <cit> . sensitisation of test animals with environmental mycobacteria have been documented as interfering with the interpretation of tuberculin results by affecting sensitivity and specificity  <cit> .

many mycobacterial species are ubiquitous organisms in environmental reservoirs; especially in water and soil  <cit>  and can survive and multiply under a wide range of environmental conditions. their recovery from tissues of slaughter animals originating from such areas is indicative of the mycobacterial status of the environment and water sources  <cit>  as well as their potential to cause infection  <cit> . in most pastoral areas in uganda, animals drink from natural water holes, dug out ponds or valley dams or tanks, which are often heavily contaminated with animal waste. as documented, water high in organic matter or animal dejections enhances the growth of environmental mycobacteria  <cit>  and such water constitutes the greatest risk of exposure to humans and animals  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study confirmed the presence of m. bovis among cattle in the pastoral cattle corridor in mid-central and mid-western areas of uganda and detected new and specific spoligotypes not reported before. furthermore, the study gives an insight into other mycobacterial species infecting cattle in this region and thereby contributes to explaining the high avian or non specific reactor patterns commonly observed in tuberculin tested animals in these areas. strong avian reactions in the tuberculin testing scheme reduce the tuberculin test specificity, something that calls for a review of the interpretation of tuberculin tests in pastoral areas.
