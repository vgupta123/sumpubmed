BACKGROUND
huntington's disease  is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder which is caused by polyglutamine  expansion in the amino-terminus of huntingtin . htt is a soluble protein of  <dig>  amino acids that has no sequence homology with other proteins. except for the extreme amino-terminus, with its adjacent polyq region and proline-rich segments, the entire ~350-kd protein is predicted to be composed of  <dig> α-helical heat repeats. increasing evidence indicates that htt functions as a molecular scaffold that is able to organize a variety of signaling complexes  <cit> . htt is expressed ubiquitously in humans and rodents, with the highest levels found in cns neurons and the testes  <cit> . intracellularly, htt is associated with various organelles, including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum  and golgi complex  <cit> . this widespread subcellular localization does not facilitate the definition of its function. hdh is evolutionary conserved – a single copy of the htt gene is expressed in all vertebrates   <cit> . the htt gene is also present in d. melanogaster genome, but absent in the c. elegans and s. cerevisiae genomes  <cit> . all vertebrate isoforms of htt, but not drosophila htt, contain an amino-terminal polyq region.

complete knockout of the mouse htt gene  causes embryonic death before day  <dig>    <cit> . after gastrulation, htt becomes important for neurogenesis – mice carrying a <50% dose of wild-type htt display profound malformations of the cortex and striatum  <cit> . another study has shown that greatly reduced htt levels are insufficient to support normal mouse development  <cit> . in addition to its function in development, htt may play a role in the regulation of apoptosis, control of bdnf production, vesicular and mitochondrial transport, neuronal gene transcription, and synaptic transmission . despite all of these efforts and results, the exact function of htt in cells still remains largely unknown.

in addition to answering an academic question concerning the normal function of htt, knowledge of its function is important for understanding hd pathogenesis and for the treatment of huntington's disease . although the hd mutation is considered to be a "gain of function" mutation, it has been suggested that the loss of normal htt function might also contribute to the pathogenesis of hd  <cit> . approaches that are based on reducing mutant htt expression such as rna interference  <cit>  and the use of intrabodies  <cit>  are currently considered to be promising strategies for hd treatment. it is likely that these agents will cause inactivation or impair normal function of both mutant and wild type htt alleles. one can envision a therapy that combines such htt-inactivating agents with drugs that restore the function of targets and pathways downstream from wild-type htt. however, because both normal hdh function is not known and downstream pathways have not been identified, such a combined therapy approach is not feasible at the moment.

to systematically search for htt's normal function, we used hdh +/-  <cit>  and hdh-floxed mice  <cit>  to generate immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts  which contain a single functional copy of hdh gene  or lack hdh completely . we compared inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor -mediated ca2+ signals in these cells. we then performed a genome-wide gene transcription profiling of hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cells using microarrays to obtain novel, unique, and unbiased information about the normal function of htt in fibroblasts, which may contribute to our understanding and treatment of hd.

RESULTS
generation of hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cell lines
to generate cell lines lacking htt expression, we employed a conditional mutagenesis strategy based on the in vitro recombination of an hdh allele in cultured fibroblasts that are also carrying either a wild-type  or null  hdh allele. the hdh and hdh fibroblasts were obtained from embryos derived from a cross between hdh +/- and hdh-floxed/floxed mice . primary fibroblasts were prepared and plated separately from each embryo as described in methods. after two days in culture, the primary fibroblasts from all embryos with identical genotype  were pooled together and transfected with a linearized sv <dig> plasmid. transfected cells were then cultured for four to six weeks until immortalized hdh floxed/+ and hdh floxed/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts  were obtained . to recombine the hdh floxed allele, immortalized hdh floxed/+ and hdh floxed/- mefs were infected with lenti-nls-gfp-cre virus encoding nuclear-targeted gfp-cre fusion protein  <cit>  . using the procedure described above, we generated four hdh-het  and four hdh-ko  mef cell lines. the expression of htt in the generated mef lines was assessed by western blotting of whole cell lysates using anti-htt monoclonal antibody. quantification of western blotting data verified similar levels of htt expression in all  <dig> hdh-het lines . consistent with the genotype of the generated cells, we detected a protein of predicted size  in lysates from the hdh-het cells, but not in lysates from hdh-ko lines . the same samples were probed with monoclonal antibodies against β-actin as a loading control . thus, we concluded that we successfully generated four hdh-het and four hdh-ko mef lines on similar genetic background. we reasoned that comparison of resulting mef lines may reveal clues about normal function of htt protein in cells.

intracellular calcium signaling in hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cell lines
previous studies have implicated impaired calcium signaling in the pathogenesis of hd  <cit> . the htt directly binds to the inositol  <dig> ,5-trisposphate receptor , an intracellular ca2+ release channel  <cit> . the expression of mutated htt has been shown to affect the insp3r activity  <cit>  and mitochondrial ca2+ signals and bioenergetics  <cit> . since htt and mutated htt directly targets both er and mitochondrial sites, it is possible that htt may have some relevance for the physical and local ca2+ coupling between er and mitochondria  <cit> . to test this idea and to determine a role played by htt in intracellular ca2+ signaling, we performed a series of cytosolic and mitochondrial ca2+ imaging experiments with generated mef lines. two hdh-het  and two hdh-ko mef cell lines   were selected for ca2+ imaging studies.

in these experiments hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cell lines were challenged by atp, an agonist of insp <dig> signaling pathway in fibroblasts. before stimulation with atp the incubation medium was switched to a ca2+ free buffer to prevent ca2+ entry. the cytosolic c and mitochondrial m levels were monitored simultaneously as described in methods. we found that pre-stimulation c was higher in the hdh-het cells  and het <dig>  <dig> ±  <dig> nm ) than that in the hdh-ko cells  and ko <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> nm , p <  <dig> ). stimulation with a suboptimal dose of atp  elicited large c spikes in hdh-het cells, whereas only a small and slow c rise was evoked in the hdh-ko cells . many hdh-ko cells did not show any c rise in response to  <dig> μm atp . mobilization of the residual ca2+ by optimal atp  evoked a relatively large c elevation in the hdh-ko cells . the atp-induced c spikes were closely followed by a m elevation in the hdh-het cells, whereas the m rise was modest in the hdh-ko cells . thus, the atp-induced intracellular ca2+ mobilization was suppressed and desensitized in the hdh-ko cells.

the attenuated atp-induced c signal in the hdh-ko cells could be due to reduced insp <dig> generation, due to reduced sensitivity of insp3r or due to depleted er ca2+ pool. to discriminate between these possibilities the insp3-induced ca2+ mobilization was quantified in suspensions of permeabilized mef cells. the steady state c was similar in both hdh-het and in hdh-ko cells . the ca2+ pool size for both the er and the ionophore-sensitive compartment was larger in the hdh-ko than in the control cells , whereas the uncoupler-sensitive mitochondrial compartment showed no difference . sequential application of a suboptimal and optimal insp <dig> revealed lesser insp3-sensitivity in the hdh-ko cells than in the het cells . however, the insp <dig> sensitive fraction of the er was approximately 75% in both control and hdh-het cells . furthermore, neither the passive ca2+ buffering nor the mitochondrial ca2+ uptake was altered in the cells lacking the hdh . collectively, the data obtained in permeabilized cells suggest that the insp <dig> sensitivity of the insp <dig> receptor is attenuated in the hdh-deficient cells, providing a mechanism to underlie the suppression of the insp3-linked c signaling in the hdh-ko cells. the effect of hdh on the insp <dig> sensitivity is likely to be mediated by direct association between htt and insp3r  <cit> .

microarray analysis of transcripts expressed in hdh-ko and hdh-het mefs
the results described in the previous section suggested that htt plays a direct role in ca2+ signaling by modulating insp3r function. many studies suggested that htt also plays a major role in control of gene transcription  <cit> . to uncover potential gene expression changes we performed genome-wide transcription profiling of hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cells. using the procedures described in methods, we isolated total rna from hdh-het mef lines  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  and from hdh-ko mef lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> . the resulting  <dig> samples were provided to the ut southwestern microarray core facility  for genome-wide expression profiling using sentrix mouse- <dig> expression bead chips  .

all  <dig> arrays produced highly reproducible and consistent gene expression data. the microarray results have been deposited in ncbis gene expression omnibus , and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  <cit> . cluster analysis of the over-all gene expression data from the  <dig> samples demonstrated that all six hdh-het samples and all six hdh-ko samples were clustered together, forming two clearly distinct groups . we also found that the duplicate samples  were most similar to each other when compared to other samples , as should be expected. thus, we concluded that we obtained a high quality dataset of transcripts expressed in hdh-het and hdh-ko mef lines.

in the next level of analysis, we combined all results obtained in six arrays with the hdh-het samples  and in six arrays with the hdh-ko samples . using illumina beadstudio software, we performed a statistical analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes between the hdh-ko and hdh-het groups. we found that from  <dig> probes existing on the mouse- <dig> beadchips arrays,  <dig>  probes were present  in at least one of these two groups. statistical analysis  has identified  <dig> transcripts that were significantly different between hdh-het and hdh-ko groups  . among these  <dig> targets,  <dig> were up-regulated in the ko group and  <dig> were down-regulated . thus, we concluded that inactivation of hdh expression has a very significant effect on the transcriptional profile of mef cells. the average signal intensities for each probe in hdh-het and hdh-ko groups are included in the excel format for the  <dig> differentially expressed targets .

analysis and annotation of microarray data
in the annotation of microarray data, we focused on  <dig> unique genes whose expression differed by at least 2-fold between hdh-het and hdh-ko groups. from these genes  <dig> genes  were up-regulated and  <dig> genes  were down-regulated in hdh-ko cells when compared to hdh-het cells. in order to extract biological information from these genes, we performed annotation of the array results using the ingenuity pathway analysis platform  <cit>  and the gostat software  <cit> . we found that several significant go categories can be pulled from the data: developmental process , nervous system development and function , lipid metabolism , glucosamine metabolic process , transcription regulator activity , cellular_component:plasma membrane , regulation of cellular process , endocytosis , mitochondrion , extracellular matrix , cytoskeleton , others , indicating the possible disruption of several functional pathways in the absence of htt . we have not observed significant changes in gene expression levels of most proteins involved in ca2+ signaling pathways , indicating that ca2+ signaling changes observed in our functional experiments  are likely to be due to post-translational effects, such as for example changes in insp3r gating properties.

confirmation of gene expression with real-time pcr
in order to confirm our microarray results, we performed quantitative real-time pcr  analysis for several of the candidate genes. for these experiments we choose three genes that were significantly down-regulated in hdh-ko mefs  and three genes that were significantly up-regulated in hdh-ko mefs  . we observed a good correlation between averaged microarray results and qpcr data for all six genes evaluated . moreover, we observed a good correlation between microarray and qpcr data for results obtained with cdna samples from individual hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cell lines .

comparison with gene expression profiling of hdh-null es cells
when our paper was in preparation, another group independently reported genome-wide expression profiling of hdh-null embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . it is of interest to compare our findings with hdh-ko mef cells with results obtained for hdh-null es cells. strehlow at al  reported that expression of  <dig> known transcripts was significantly affected in hdh-null es cells when compared to wild type es cells. the affected transcripts were divided into several classes of interest: protein degradation , extracellular matrix , cell division , and patterning/development   <cit> . to compare these data with our results, we attempted to locate the genes highlighted by the study by strehlow at al  among the genes which expression differs at p <  <dig>  between hdh-ko and hdh-het mef cells in our experiments. we determined that two of the three genes in the patterning/development category  do not present in mef cell lines, leftb/lefty is present in mef cell lines, but did not show a significant difference between het and ko mefs. all five genes in the protein degradation category are present in mef cell lines but did not show significant difference in our experiments. we found that adam <dig> is not present in mef cell lines. b3galt <dig>  col4a <dig> and clo4a <dig> are present in mef cells, but did not show significant difference. we further found that one out of four genes in cell division category  is also significantly affected in our experiments. ccdc <dig> is up-regulated in both hdh-null es cells and in hdh-ko mef cells. plk <dig> is also strongly upregulated  in hdh-null es cells  <cit>  but did not show significant difference in hdh-ko mef cells in our experiments. aurkc is not present in mef cells, while pttg <dig> is present but did not show significant difference.

strehlow at al  induced neuronal differentiation of hdh-null es cells by application of retinoic acid and performed microarray analysis of the in vitro differentiated neurons at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days post-differentiation  <cit> . the expression of transcripts in the number of categories was different between hdh-null and wild type in vitro differentiated neurons  <cit> . changes in only a few genes have been consistently observed in the two studies .

discussion
despite the importance of understanding the normal function of htt for both basic biology and for hd, its function remains largely unknown  <cit> . the generation of hdh-null mef cell lines described in our study provides a new and unbiased approach to search for novel htt functions.

the htt directly binds to the insp3r, an intracellular ca2+ release channel  <cit> . the expression of mutated htt has been shown to affect the insp3r activity  <cit>  and mitochondrial ca2+ signals and bioenergetics  <cit> . thus, in the first series of experiments we evaluated insp3r-mediated ca2+ cytosolic and mitochondrial ca2+ signals in hdh-null mef cells. as a result of these experiments we found that insp3r sensitivity to stimulation by insp <dig> was reduced in the absence of hdh . we further found that htt appears to be dispensable for er-mitochondrial ca2+ coupling . thus the altered insp3r-induced cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium signaling in the hdh-null mef cells may result from the lack of hdh by itself and does not necessarily require a secondary change in gene regulation.

interestingly, a large number of ca2+-related genes, such as cacna2d <dig> , itpr <dig> , homer <dig> , atp2a <dig> , drd <dig> , prkcb <dig> , pde1b , atp2b <dig> , camk2b , plcb <dig> , rgs <dig> , and camk2a , have been recently reported to be consistently and significantly downregulated in a striatal region of symptomatic human hd patients and aging hd mouse models  <cit> . these results are in agreement with the "ca2+ hypothesis of hd"  <cit>  and with a direct role of htt in intracellular ca2+ signaling supported by our experiments.

many studies suggested that htt also plays a major role in control of gene transcription  <cit> . to search for changes in gene transcription resulting from deletion of htt gene, we performed a genome-wide comparison of transcription profiles in mef cells expressing a single copy of hdh  and in mef cells which lack hdh expression . to minimize sources of variability, the hdh-het and hdh-ko mef cells were generated in parallel experiments and on identical genetic background. from our annotation analysis, we found that a large group of affected genes play a role in embryonic development . this result was not unexpected because htt is essential for embryonic development, and complete inactivation of htt expression in knock-out mice causes early embryonic lethality  <cit> . the functions of these genes may provide additional clues about the mechanism responsible for embryonic lethality in hdh knockout mice, for example there are some similar phenotypic manifestations between hdh nullizygous embryos and knockout mutants lacking fibroblast growth factor receptor <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, we found fgfrl <dig> message is downregulated approximately 2-fold in hdh-ko mef cells when compared to hdh-het cells .

after gastrulation, htt is important for neurogenesis – mice carrying a <50% dose of wild-type htt display profound malformations of the cortex and striatum  <cit> . the neuronal inactivation of htt during mid- to late gestation, for example, leads to neurological abnormalities and progressive degeneration   <cit> . our analysis revealed a number of genes involved in nervous system development and function which were affected in hdh-ko mef cell lines , and this list should also provide useful information to guide further studies of htt's normal function in the nervous system. for example, sox- <dig> expression was absent from hdh-ko mefs. sox  genes encode transcription factors regulating crucial developmental decisions in different systems. sox <dig> is expressed in, and is essential for, totipotent inner cell mass stem cells and other early multipotent cell lineages, and its ablation causes early embryonic lethality  <cit> . in many different species, sox <dig> is a marker of the nervous system from the beginning of its development, it maintains a stem-cell like state and actively inhibits neuronal differentiation, sox <dig> deficiency causes neurodegeneration and impaired neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain. does the absence of sox- <dig> play some role in the early embryonic lethality and neurodegeneration in hdh knock-out mice and conditional knock-out mice respectively? further studies are required to answer these questions. sox- <dig> is another sox family gene which changes dramatically in hdh-ko mef cell lines . the widespread expression of sox- <dig> in both the central and peripheral nervous system suggests that sox- <dig> plays a general role in neuronal development, and its changes in hdh-ko cells merit further investigation.

another group of genes whose expression was significantly affected in hdh-ko mef cells are the genes related to lipid metabolism. it has been reported in another microarray analysis using clonal striata-derived cells, that genes involved in lipid metabolism were affected after expressing different n-terminal 548-amino-acid htt fragments  <cit> . moreover, recent biochemical data indicated that htt binds to caveolin and plays a direct role in cholesterol metabolism  <cit> . all these data suggested that htt plays an important role in lipid metabolism, which may be affected by hd mutation. indeed, rxrg  and rbp <dig>  are consistently downregulated in a striatal region of symptomatic human hd patients and aging hd mouse models  <cit> .

from our analysis we also found calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha2/delta subunit  <dig>  was down-regulated about  <dig> fold , interestingly the same cacna2d <dig> protein has been recently identified as novel htt-binding partner in unbiased mass-spectroscopy screen  <cit> . a closely related alpha2/delta subunit  <dig>  was reported on the 3rd place on the list of the genes which are consistently and significantly downregulated in a striatal region of symptomatic human hd patients and aging hd mouse models  <cit> . as discussed above, these results indicate that htt may play a role in regulation of ca2+ channel activity and ca2+ signaling in cells, consistent with ca2+ hypothesis of hd  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we generated four hdh-het and four hdh-ko mef cell lines and performed functional analysis of these cells by ca2+ imaging methods and genome-wide transcription profiling of these cell lines using a microarray approach. our results indicated that htt plays a direct role in intracellular ca2+ signaling by directly modulating insp3r function in cells. the results of microarray analysis provided a novel and unique information resource for exploring normal function of htt in cells. the microarray results have been deposited in ncbis gene expression omnibus , and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig>  <cit> . the hdh-ko cell lines will also serve as a useful tool for future follow-up experiments aimed at elucidating htt functions in vivo.
