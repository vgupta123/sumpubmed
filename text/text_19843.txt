BACKGROUND
carotenoid polyene oxygenases are a diverse superfamily whose members play a crucial role in carotenoid/retinoid metabolism, producing, among other actions, key hormones such as abscisic acid in plants  <cit>  and vitamin a in animals  <cit> . three mammalian family members with very different functions have been described: 1) β-carotene- <dig> '-monooxygenase  <dig> is an enzyme which symmetrically cleaves β-carotene to produce two molecules of all-trans retinal  <cit> , and is the initial step in biosynthesis of vitamin a in animals  <cit> ; 2) β-carotene-9',10'-monooxygenase  is believed to cleave β-carotene asymmetrically to produce 10'-apocarotenal and β-ionone  <cit> ; and 3) rpe <dig> is an isomerase in the visual cycle, converting all-trans retinyl palmitate to 11-cis retinol  <cit> . in bcmo <dig> knockout mice, disruption in bcmo <dig> leads to hypercarotenemia on a provitamin a-rich, vitamin a-deficient diet and also to changes in lipid metabolism and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity  <cit> . pathological effects of mutations in bcmo <dig>  <cit>  have also been described in humans. therefore, the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme is of particular interest.

based on the solved apocarotenoid- <dig> '-oxygenase  crystal structure, all these iron -dependent oxygenases are predicted to share a common seven bladed β-propeller structure  <cit> . in aco, fe is coordinated in a near-perfect octahedral arrangement by four histidines. the fifth position in the crystal structure is occupied by a water molecule, and dioxygen is proposed to complete the coordination geometry at the sixth position. presumably, all members of this family, including bcmo <dig>  share this iron center arrangement. recently, we validated the crystal structure predictions by showing that mutations of the invariant histidines h172a, h237a, h308a and h514a which are paralogs of the iron-coordinating histidines in aco abolished bcmo <dig> activity. although still controversial, the central cleavage of β-carotene by bcmo <dig> is currently believed to follow a monooxygenase mechanism  <cit> . on the other hand, it has unequivocally been shown that the plant family member ccd <dig> is a dioxygenase  <cit> . experiments by olson et al. with crude enzyme preparations led the authors to believe that bcmo <dig> is also a dioxygenase  <cit> . however, the substituted bispropionate mononuclear iron complexes, which closely resemble aco iron coordination, efficiently catalyze both olefin epoxidation  and cis-dihydroxylation   <cit> , suggesting that both mechanisms are plausible for the various carotenoid oxygenases.

the process of monooxygenation is suggested to involve reductive oxygen activation at metal complexes followed by oxygen transfer to the substrate  <cit> . in the aco crystal structure, all-trans carotenoid substrate was modeled in a  <dig> -13',14'-di-cis conformation  <cit> . the formation of cation intermediates in the process of trans- to cis-isomerization is well documented for electrochemical, ferric oxide and iodine oxidation of carotenoids  <cit> . also, cationic intermediates were predicted in an ab initio study of lycopene isomerization, providing a quantum mechanical explanation for the antioxidant properties of carotenoids  <cit> . recently it has been demonstrated that a carotenoid cation-radical is formed in the photosynthetic light harvesting system  <cit> . in addition, the analysis of the aco oxidative cleavage mechanism by the quantum chemical density field theory method predicted formation of a substrate radical cation  <cit> . a cation-radical is formed by one electron oxidation of β-carotene; a second one-electron oxidation leads to formation of a dication β-carotene. electron paramagnetic resonance  and electrochemical studies of carotenoid oxidation led to a proposed equilibrium between radical cation, dication and the original carotenoid. moreover, careful analysis of the electrochemical behavior of β-carotene in methylene chloride demonstrated that two electrons are transferred in the first oxidation step, and thus formation of dications occurs at lower oxidation potential  <cit> . simultaneous electrochemical/epr experiments showed subsequent decay of the β-carotene dication to a monocation as a result of the proton transfer  <cit> . on the other hand, carbocation could be produced by protonating the β-carotene carbon-carbon double bond chain. diamagnetic carbocations exhibit considerable stability at room temperature due to charge delocalization  <cit> . a large body of published work points to stabilization of carbocations by anionic and aromatic residues in active sites of polyene chain synthesizing enzymes  <cit> . recently, an intramolecular proton-transfer mechanism has been implicated in a carbocationic mechanism of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and aristolochene synthase  <cit> . therefore we have investigated the question of involvement of carbocation intermediates during the enzymatic cleavage of β-carotene.

in the present report, we have analyzed the role of conserved catalytic site aromatic residues in the catalytic mechanism of bcmo <dig>  using site-directed mutagenesis to create a set of mutant enzymes and characterizing these mutants using in vitro and in vivo assays.

RESULTS
modeling of mouse bcmo <dig> on the aco template and identification of conserved aromatics in the substrate binding cleft
preliminary clustalw  <dig>  alignment of bcmo <dig> and aco was optimized for conserved histidines and acidic residues. this alignment was iteratively presented to the swiss model repository with manual adjustment after each cycle for the final complete model. the alignment shows several conserved aromatic residues, particularly in regions near the fe-coordinating histidines . both these enzymes cleave carotenoids at the 15-15' position. using this alignment to model the structure of bcmo <dig>  we found four aromatics within the substrate cleft paralogous to aromatics in aco: f <dig>  in the highly conserved fdg motif above the fe, y <dig>  above e <dig> fixing the second coordinating histidine , y <dig>  above e <dig> fixing the third coordinating histidine , and w <dig>  near e <dig> fixing the fourth coordinating histidine  . f <dig>  y <dig> and y <dig> are predicted to be less than  <dig> Å from the polyene chain of the substrate, and w <dig> is similarly close to one of the β-ionone rings of the substrate .

to determine the role of these aromatic residues and the nearby acidic residues in the catalytic mechanism of bcmo <dig>  we constructed a set of mutants in which each of these aromatic residues was replaced with leucine or an alternative aromatic. y <dig> was also exchanged to the paralogous glutamine, as in bcmo <dig>  in previous work, we had determined the effect of mutating the conserved acidic residues to alanine  <cit> .

analysis of aromatics in the substrate binding cleft in vivo
since mutation of the crucial residues in the enzyme leads to significant reduction in the activity of bcmo <dig>  the sensitivity of in vitro enzymatic assay is not sufficient for analysis of these residues <cit> . therefore, we made use of β-carotene-accumulating e.coli/pac-beta  <cit>  as an in vivo system for measurement of enzymatic activity.

substrate for bcmo <dig>  is constitutively synthesized and accumulated in this specially designed e.coli strain. after we allowed sufficient time for β-carotene to be accumulated in the cells, we induced synthesis of bcmo <dig> and measured the amount of beta-carotene left in induced and uninduced cells. as previously described  <cit> , uninduced pbad/bcmo <dig> constructs are functionally equivalent to the irrelevant pbad/lacz construct  for use as negative controls of bcmo <dig> activity.

mutation of either f <dig> or w <dig> to leucine had little effect on the activity of bcmo <dig> and mutation of f <dig> to tyrosine or w <dig> to phenylalanine had no effect in this assay . however, a more significant effect was seen with the two tyrosines, y <dig> and y <dig>  in the case of y <dig>  practically no loss of activity was observed with the y235w mutant, moderate loss of activity with the y235f mutant, and greater loss with the y235l mutant . y <dig> is located adjacent to the e <dig> "fixing" glutamate in the substrate binding cleft , for which the e140a mutation has been shown to reduce activity to about 50% relative to wt  <cit> . thus, these two residues could play a role in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. analysis of the double mutants for y235f/e140a and y235l/e140a revealed residual activity  only for y235f/e140a mutant  <dig> h post-induction . these results support the idea that this pair is not involved in proton transfer for formation of carbocations but may point to compensating mechanisms in substrate stabilization. as we noted above, y <dig> is located on our model less than  <dig> Å from β-carotene and  <dig>  Å from e <dig>  to address the function of y <dig> in the bcmo <dig> catalytic mechanism, we constructed a set of mutants: y326w , y326f, y326l and y326q . catalytic activity of y326w  is comparable to that of the wild type bcmo <dig>  in the accumulative in vivo system  and y326f is also active. mutation to the nonaromatic amino acid leucine, y326l, resulted in a drop in catalytic activity . the most significant decrease in catalytic activity was observed by introduction of the partially positively charged amino acid glutamine in place of tyrosine: y326q . . our previous studies had demonstrated that, of the three "fixing" glutamates, only e <dig> is indispensable for enzyme activity as the e405a mutant has no activity, although the protein is expressed  <cit> . thus, compensating mechanisms are unlikely for this pair of residues. these data collectively demonstrate that aromaticity of the residue is important for the enzyme activity in both the y <dig> and y <dig> positions but not in the f <dig> or w <dig> positions.

expression of mutant constructs
to examine the correlation of enzyme activity with in vivo protein expression levels for the various mutants, immunoblots of extracts from  <dig> cell lines transformed with mutant bcmo <dig> constructs were analyzed by his-tag and rabbit polyclonal bcmo <dig> specific antibodies . endogeneous ef-tu bacterial protein  was used as a loading control. when compared with wildtype, the drastic decrease in mutant enzyme activity observed in vivo correlated with somewhat lowered expression levels, but these changes in activity could not be explained solely by a change in expression levels.

in vitro analysis of enzymatic activity of bcmo <dig> tyrosines
in our in vitro assay system we determined km and vmax for y326w, and two mutants on the propeller axis, y418f and y420f. tyrosines  <dig> and  <dig> are fairly well conserved among mammal family members and are located far from the catalytic site of the enzyme. in y326w, we observed a 4-fold decrease in vmax and 4-fold increase in km, whereas y <dig> f did not show significant changes in kinetics and y418f shows 3-fold decrease in vmax and only 2-fold increase in km . we were unable to determine kinetics for the y235f mutant due to insufficient sensitivity of the in vitro assay used in our studies here, although at the highest substrate concentration technically possible in this assay system, a low level of activity was observed . this suggests a probable increase in km for the y235f mutant. also, the substantial increase in km observed only in the substrate cleft residues supports the hypothesis that they play a role in substrate stabilization. neighboring to y <dig>  the y236f mutant showed also about a  <dig> fold increase in km and a more pronounced  <dig> fold decrease in vmax. expression of the y236l mutant was almost abolished  in our system, and this fact points to a possible structural role for this residue.

akm  and vmax  were calculated from hanes  plots. calculation of enzymatic activity was based on the production of retinal from β-carotene. data was calculated based on average substrate curve for each protein.

# these data are km apparent values due to limitations of β-carotene solubility in reaction mixture .

diphenylamine is an inhibitor of bcmo1
many enzymes involving a transient carbocation mechanism are effectively inhibited by positively charged amine derivatives  <cit> . the inhibitory potency of these amine derivatives is linked to their ability to be protonated at physiological ph   <cit>  or to their similarity to transition state carbocation intermediates . to further elucidate the mechanism of action of bcmo <dig>  we examined the effects of various amine inhibitors of carotenoid synthesis such as nicotine   <cit> , galactosamine   <cit>  and diphenylamine   <cit>  on enzyme activity. neither nicotine nor galactosamine significantly inhibited bcmo <dig> ; however, diphenylamine inhibited bcmo <dig> at sub-millimolar concentrations in vitro  diphenylamine, which inhibits carotenoid synthesis completely at  <dig> μm concentration  <cit>  also impaired β-carotene degradation significantly our in vivo assay in β-carotene-accumulating e.coli expressing bcmo <dig> .

discussion
in multiple protein sequence alignment of vertebrate carotenoid oxygenase family member sequences , we found that all members conserved aromatics in positions comparable to f <dig>  y <dig>  and w <dig>  with respect to y <dig> in bcmo <dig>  y was conserved in other bcmo <dig> orthologs, w was the paralogous residue in rpe <dig>  but aromatic resides were not found in bcmo <dig> sequences at this position. it should be noted that bcmo <dig> and rpe <dig> both act at the  <dig> carbon position, whereas bcmo <dig> is thought to cleave carotenoids asymmetrically. the swiss-pdb model of bcmo <dig> built on the aco template predicts that f <dig>  y <dig>  y <dig> and w <dig> are aromatics located in the carotenoid binding cleft. the possibility that some or all of these residues participate in catalytically important functions was thus an important consideration. tyrosines are known to play a key role in coupled proton-shuttling in a large number of metalloenzymes  <cit> , and, additionally, can directly participate in electron transfer by forming tyrosyl radicals  <cit> . they may also play a structural role by participating in the architecture of the enzyme active site, or play a role in the correct positioning of the substrate and cofactor  <cit>  and are known to take part in interaction with substrate and/or cofactors and determine the substrate specificity in a variety of enzymes  <cit> . finally, tyrosine and other aromatic amino acids are implicated in cation-π interactions stabilizing carbocation intermediates generated during enzymatic reactions  <cit> .

our results indicate that mutations of y <dig> and y <dig> to leucine significantly impair catalytic activity of bcmo <dig>  we found that the aromaticity of amino acids y <dig> and y <dig> are important for enzymatic activity, whereas mutation of f <dig> or w <dig> to leucine had little effect. mutation of either of these two tyrosines to other aromatic residues  does not affect enzyme activity by more than 10-20% relative to wild type, but replacement to non-aromatic residues  leads to significant loss of enzymatic activity. the studies presented here support a mechanism implicating cation-π stabilization of a putative carbocation intermediate. we can exclude the possibility of radical formation by these tyrosines in bcmo <dig> catalysis, as the tyrosine to leucine mutants, y235l and y326l, although reduced in activity , exhibited some level of residual activity. additionally, epr analyses of bcmo <dig> failed to detect tyrosyl radical formation . however, this finding does not exclude the possibility of other functional roles for these residues. the swiss-pdb model of bcmo <dig> built on the aco template predicts close localization of y235-e <dig> and y326-e <dig> residues with possible hydrogen bonding for the latter pair  . however, our mutagenesis data suggest that these hydrogen bonds cannot be crucial for the catalytic mechanism of bcmo1; moreover, simultaneous replacement of y235f/e140a does not eliminate activity.

from our data it is reasonable to propose that aromaticity of the two tyrosines y <dig> and y <dig> plays an important role in the catalytic mechanism of bcmo <dig>  to explore this possibility, we mounted an ab initio model of β-carotene onto the bcmo <dig> structural model by thermodynamic optimization. it was observed that tyrosines y <dig> and y <dig> fix the position of the substrate on two sides of the 15-15' double bond of the substrate . the predicted hydrophobic interactions with substrate are in accordance with our catalytic activity data for y235f, y235w and y235l, and y326w, y326f and y326l mutants. consequently, we can speculate that in the case of a mechanism involving one-electron oxidation by dioxygen bound to the ferrous ion and the subsequent radical-cation formation  <cit> , or two one-electron oxidation steps and dication formation  <cit> , the aromatic residues  and glutamates  stabilize a cationic intermediate with charge delocalization along the polyene chain. on the other hand, we could not rule out the possibility of protonation of a double bond and formation of a carbocation as in the case of isopentyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase  <cit> . distances between these tyrosines and β-carotene chain in our model are less that  <dig> Å which is in good agreement with cation-π stabilization   <cit> . the occurrence of such stabilization was previously observed in squalene-hopene cyclase and oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase  <cit> . in the polycyclization cascade of squalene and oxidosqualene, aspartates initiate the cyclization process by protonation of the terminal double bond and stabilize the first carbocation intermediate  <cit> . the π-electrons of several aromatic residues stabilize cationic intermediates in other enzymes  <cit> . the cation intermediate would explain the observation of transient substrate isomerization in the binding cleft of aco  <cit> . transient carbocations are formed in many steps of sterol and carotenoid synthesis, and various positively charged amino derivatives could noncompetitively inhibit these enzymes. of the three inhibitors tested here, diphenylamine, an oxidation inhibitor, was the only one to have a substantial inhibitory effect on bcmo <dig> activity. diphenylamine is reported to inhibit electron transfer in photosynthetic membranes  <cit>  and carotenogenesis by inhibiting carotenoid ketolase and phytoene desaturase. however, this is in line with the common mechanism of inhibition by diphenylamine of iron oxygenases and is not necessarily conclusive for carbocation formation.

as expected, replacement of y <dig> by tryptophan, which has the highest π-binding energy of the aromatic series  <cit> , did not negatively effect activity in vivo. the altered biochemical parameters  for the y326w mutant could be explained by steric hindrance. also, it is important to note that the in vivo assay shows the cumulative effect of mutation and thus cannot estimate the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. replacement of tyrosine by glutamine  <cit>  would be expected to destabilize a cation, and therefore, effectively inhibit catalytic activity of bcmo <dig>  the results presented here correlate with these hypotheses. productive replacement of y <dig> by tryptophan, such as found at the paralogous residue w <dig> in rpe <dig>  <cit>  suggests that bcmo <dig> and rpe <dig> may share a similar catalytic mechanism. in fact, the formation of a carbocation intermediate had been proposed in the catalytic mechanism of retinoid isomerization in the rpe  <cit>  prior to the identification of rpe <dig> as the isomerase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we show that aromaticity of the substrate binding cleft aromatic residues y <dig> and y <dig> is important for the activity of recombinant mouse bcmo <dig>  the enzymatic activity changes follows the trend y235w>y235f>y235l and y326w~y326f>y326l>y326q which agrees very well with the π-binding energies of these amino acids. based on the mutational data and structure modeling we propose that cation-π interactions between y <dig> and y <dig> and β-carotene cation intermediate play an important role in the mechanism of bcmo <dig>  we also show that replacing f <dig> and w <dig>  two other substrate binding cleft aromatic residues, does not affect bcmo <dig> enzyme activity. insight into the mechanism of bcmo <dig> would help to understand carotenoid levels and metabolism in humans  <cit> .
