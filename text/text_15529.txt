BACKGROUND
at fertilization, the union of egg and sperm promotes a series of biochemical and cell biological changes within the fertilized egg. this phenomenon is termed 'egg activation'  <cit> . a trigger of egg activation, which acts inside the fertilized egg after the egg-sperm union, is a transient increase in intracellular ca2+   <cit> . one important consequence of egg activation is that the egg acquires the ability to exclude additional fertilizing sperm . in many, but not all species, the block to polyspermy is achieved by an altered membrane potential and/or by the formation of a fertilization envelope. another important consequence is that the activated egg resumes meiotic cell division. in the case of amphibian and most mammalian species, the meiotic cell cycle of unfertilized eggs pauses at metaphase ii, and successful fertilization promotes meiotic resumption and extrusion of the second polar body. these egg activation events are followed by the fusion of maternal and paternal nuclei and the initiation of embryonic cell division that produce an offspring.

the sperm-induced ca2+ transient, a key event in the initiation of egg activation, is commonly mediated by inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate , a second messenger that is produced by the phospholipase c -catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate. the molecular mechanism operating between egg-sperm membrane interaction/fusion and the activation of plc, however, varies among species: in mammals and the newt cynops pyrrohogaster, introduction of the sperm-derived proteins plcζ  <cit>  and citrate synthase  <cit> , respectively, may account for this task. in these cases, egg-sperm membrane fusion, rather than egg-sperm membrane interaction, is crucial for initiating the ca2+ transient. on the other hand, for some sea invertebrates, fish and frogs, there is still a debate over the mechanism by which the egg undergoes a ca2+ transient. that sequential activation of the egg-associated src tyrosine kinase and plcγ is required for the ca2+ transient in the sea urchin, starfish, fish, and frog  <cit>  suggests that these species employ the membrane interaction machinery. also, some membrane-associated molecules have been postulated as sperm-interacting and signal-transducing elements in xenopus eggs  <cit> .

several studies have evaluated the function of pi 3-kinase in the early developmental processes that operate in oocytes or early embryos of various species. in xenopus, pi 3-kinase and akt are required for insulin-induced, but not progesterone-induced, oocyte maturation  <cit> , although one report has shown a requirement of pi 3-kinase for progesterone-induced oocyte maturation  <cit> . there are also reports that the activation of γ-subspecies of pi 3-kinase  <cit>  or application of wortmannin  <cit>  induces oocyte maturation. on the other hand, oocyte maturation in the ascidian  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and starfish  <cit>  has been shown to require activity of pi 3-kinase. oocyte-specific deletion of pten is shown to cause premature activation of the primordial follicle cells  <cit> , suggesting that a precise level of pip <dig> is important for this process.

moreover, the importance of pi 3-kinase and/or akt has been demonstrated in fgf-dependent signal transduction  <cit>  and glucose transport in xenopus oocytes  <cit> , the first mitotic cell division in the sea urchin  <cit>  and starfish  <cit> , autocrine-mediated survival signaling of mouse two-cell embryos  <cit> , mesoderm induction  <cit> , gastrulation  <cit>  and neurogenesis  <cit>  in xenopus. collectively, these studies demonstrate the general importance of pi 3-kinase and its enzymatic products in several aspects of development. however, a study on egg-associated pi 3-kinase and akt with a focus on fertilization signaling has yet to be done, though mehlmann et al.  <cit>  found that ly <dig> does not inhibit ca2+ transients in fertilized mouse eggs.

here, we provide evidence that the sperm-induced ca2+ transient requires the activity of the egg-associated pi 3-kinase in xenopus. many somatic cell systems utilize pi 3-kinase as a downstream effector of tyrosine kinase signaling  <cit> . in fertilized xenopus eggs, however, tyrosine phosphorylation of the p <dig> subunit of pi 3-kinase is not evident. on the other hand, pi 3-kinase seems to act as an upstream, positive regulator for the src-plcγ pathway, because the pi 3-kinase inhibitor ly <dig> inhibits the sperm-induced activation of src, ca2+ transient, and subsequent egg activation events. subcellular fractionation studies demonstrate that the 85-kda subunit of pi 3-kinase undergoes a transient translocation to low-density, detergent-insoluble membranes , where src is present even before fertilization, awaiting a fertilization signal from sperm  <cit> . activation of pi 3-kinase in fertilized xenopus eggs is suggested by the finding that akt becomes phosphorylated at threonine- <dig> in fertilized eggs. these results highlight for the first time that activity of the egg pi 3-kinase may play an important role in signal transduction for fertilization.

RESULTS
we first examined the effect of ly <dig>  a potent pi 3-kinase inhibitor, on sperm-induced activation of the src-plcγ pathway. we microinjected ly <dig> into unfertilized xenopus eggs at a final concentration of  <dig> μm. the injected eggs were inseminated for  <dig> min, fractionated, and examined for sperm-induced activation and phosphorylation of src and plcγ, using immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and/or in vitro kinase assays . ly <dig> inhibited the sperm-induced activation of src, as judged by the phosphorylation of tyrosine- <dig> in src  and by the kinase activity toward a synthetic peptide substrate . tyrosine phosphorylation of plcγ was also inhibited by ly <dig> . as we reported earlier, a src-specific inhibitor pp <dig> also had an inhibitory effect . neither the inactive analog pp <dig>  nor u <dig> , a plc-specific inhibitor, showed such an effect.

we have previously shown that activation of src and plcγ is necessary for sperm-induced activation of xenopus eggs. therefore, we examined the effect of ly <dig> on the downstream events of the src-plcγ pathway; namely the transient ca2+ release , inactivation of components of the cytostatic factor , and first cell cleavage . all of the ly294002-injected eggs exhibited features of an impaired transient ca2+ release, as monitored using the fluorescent signal of fura- <dig> that was introduced into the eggs . seven of nine eggs tested showed no transient ca2+ release, and two of nine showed a transient ca2+ release of decreased amplitude . ly <dig> also had an inhibitory effect on the ca2+-dependent breakdown of the mos protein kinase and cyclin b <dig> as well as dephosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase  . these ca2+-dependent events are required for cancelling the arrest of the second meiotic cell cycle and for starting embryonic cell division. actually, eggs injected with  <dig> μm ly <dig> failed to undergo normal first cell cleavage .

we also examined the effect of ly <dig> on egg activation, as evaluated by the occurrence of cortical contraction, induced by several artificial egg activators. ly <dig> effectively inhibited the egg activation induced by cathepsin b at  <dig> u/ml . on the other hand, the egg activation induced by a <dig> at  <dig> μm and that by h2o <dig> at  <dig> mm were not inhibited;  <dig> of  <dig> eggs and  <dig> of  <dig> eggs were activated, respectively. these data suggest that egg activation by cathepsin b, which mimics the action of sperm protease and requires the egg src activity, also requires the activity of pi 3-kinase. it should be noted that we did not employ ly <dig> higher than  <dig> μm, because it required more volume of dmso solution to be injected that would show a toxic effect on eggs.

immunoblotting demonstrated that an 85-kda subunit of pi 3-kinase, hereafter termed p85; is expressed in unfertilized xenopus eggs . subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that p <dig> is predominantly present in the detergent-soluble fractions of unfertilized eggs . however, fertilization promoted a transient accumulation of p <dig> in low-density, detergent-insoluble membranes  . the sperm-induced translocation of p <dig> to membrane microdomains  occurred as early as the transient translocation of plcγ  and preceded the tyrosine phosphorylation of uroplakin iii , both of which are biochemical signs of the activation of src in fertilized xenopus eggs. these translocation and phosphorylation events were shown to cease in 40-min inseminated egg samples, where dephosphorylation of mapk is taking place . translocation of p <dig> to the egg membrane microdomains was also seen when eggs were treated with either hydrogen peroxide  or cathepsin b, which are artificial egg activators involved in the activation of src . on the other hand, translocation of p <dig> did not occur when eggs were activated by the ca2+ ionophore a <dig> . under the same experimental conditions, we evaluated the tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig> by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. it was shown that only the h2o <dig> treatment of eggs promoted an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig> . these results suggest that any sperm-induced activation of pi 3-kinase involves the transient translocation of p <dig> to membrane microdomains, but not increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig> 

we next examined whether the activity of pi 3-kinase is upregulated in fertilized xenopus eggs. to this end, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase known to be a downstream target of the activated pi 3-kinase. immunoblotting demonstrated that a 60-kda akt protein is present in unfertilized xenopus eggs . fertilization promoted phosphorylation of akt at threonine- <dig>  one of the activating phosphorylation sites in akt . on the other hand, serine- <dig>  another activating phosphorylation site of akt, remained unphosphorylated in both unfertilized and fertilized eggs . ly <dig>  but not pp <dig>  blocked the threonine phosphorylation of akt . these results suggest that sperm-induced phosphorylation of akt at threonine- <dig> requires the activity of pi 3-kinase, but not the activity of src tyrosine kinase.

subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that akt protein undergoes translocation to membrane microdomains in fertilized eggs . the translocation of akt occurred as early as  <dig> min after insemination , a time course that is similar to translocation of p <dig> . quantitative analysis demonstrated that only a small fraction of akt localized to membrane microdomains in fertilized eggs . however, the threonine-308-phosphorylated forms of akt were predominantly present in the membrane microdomains . these results suggest that the sperm-induced functional interaction, and activation, of pi 3-kinase and akt take place specifically in the egg membrane microdomains. we also examined whether the sperm-induced re-localization of akt requires the activity of pi 3-kinase. ly <dig> was shown to inhibit the sperm-induced appearance of both p <dig> and akt in the membrane microdomains . like in the case of the threonine-308-phosphorylation described above, pp <dig> did not affect the re-localization of p <dig> or akt .

to examine further the involvement of the activity of pi 3-kinase in sperm-induced egg activation, we employed bp , a potent inhibitor of the phosphoinositide phosphatase pten that converts pip <dig>  an enzymatic product of pi 3-kinase, into pip <dig>  as shown in figure 4a and 4b, bp treatment of unfertilized xenopus eggs induced a cortical contraction, a cytological event of ca2+-dependent egg activation. importantly, the cortical contraction induced by bp was inhibited by pre-injection of ly <dig> . moreover, bp treatment of eggs also promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of src . these results demonstrate that artificially elevating the pip <dig> level in unfertilized eggs can promote an egg activation-like event as seen in fertilized eggs. finally, we examined the effect of pip <dig> on src tyrosine kinase activity. an in vitro kinase assay with purified xenopus src demonstrated that pip <dig> was capable of activating the autophosphorylation of src . inositol phospholipids other than pip3; namely pi, pip, and pip <dig>  did not show such a src-activating property . these results indicate pip <dig> to be a specific and direct activator for src tyrosine kinase in xenopus eggs.

discussion
in xenopus eggs, the sperm-induced activation of src tyrosine kinase plays an essential role in ca2+ transient and egg activation  <cit> . the present study has indicated the activity of pi 3-kinase to connect egg-sperm interaction/fusion with the activation of src, because 1) ly <dig> inhibits the sperm-induced activation of src, suggesting that pi 3-kinase acts as an upstream activator for src, and 2) tyrosine phosphorylation of the p <dig> subunit of pi 3-kinase, a well-known phenomenon in several cellular systems, in which one or more tyrosine kinase is activated, is not stimulated in fertilized eggs. if so, what is the mechanism for src activation by pi 3-kinase activity? one possibility is, as demonstrated in the present study, the kinase-activating interaction of pip <dig> with src. the src homology  <dig>  domain of the src protein is capable of binding pip <dig>  <cit> , supporting the possibility that interaction with pip <dig> would displace the negative-regulatory intramolecular interaction involving the sh <dig> domain, leading to the src kinase's activation.

in our experimental system, wortmannin, another potent inhibitor for pi 3-kinase, is not inhibitory to the sperm-induced egg activation in xenopus: in eggs injected with wortmannin at up to  <dig> μm, sperm could promote src activation, p <dig> translocation, cortical contraction, and most importantly akt phosphorylation, all of which are events of egg activation . there is a possibility that, in xenopus eggs, wortmannin binds preferentially to molecules other than pi 3-kinase. this idea is supported by the finding of carnero and lacal  <cit>  that wortmannin is able to induce meiotic maturation in xenopus oocytes at doses slightly higher that those required for complete inhibition of pi 3-kinase. the authors have also suggested that this effect is independent of the ability of wortmannin to inhibit pi 3-kinase since ly <dig> was unable to induce oocyte maturation at concentrations inhibitory to pi 3-kinase, and that the mechanism for wortmannin-induced maturation involves the activation of a maturation-promoting factor and mapk  <cit> .

a positive regulatory role for pip <dig> in egg activation signaling has been suggested by the finding that bp, a potent inhibitor for pten phosphoinositide phosphatase, promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of src and cortical contraction of xenopus eggs.  the results indicate that the elevation of pip <dig> levels in eggs is sufficient for promoting src-dependent signal transduction for egg activation.

we demonstrated that, in fertilized eggs, akt was phosphorylated at thr <dig>  however, we did not detect the phosphorylation of another well-known site, ser <dig>  this could be because the phosphoser473-specific antibody employed in this study was not suitable for analysis of the xenopus akt protein. however, immunoblotting has demonstrated that the phosphoser473-specific antibody well recognizes akt protein in immature xenopus oocytes and that the phosphoser <dig> signals become decreased in progesterone-treated, fully matured oocytes . therefore, we suggest that fertilization promotes the phosphorylation of akt selectively at threonine- <dig>  in mammals, phosphorylation of akt thr <dig> and ser <dig> is catalyzed by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase pdk <dig>  <cit>  and mammalian target of rapamycin mtor  <cit> , respectively. so, we assume that the signaling pathway involving pdk <dig>  not mtor, operates to promote the phosphorylation and activation of akt in fertilized eggs.

several cellular functions involve the activation of akt  <cit> . of particular interest is the anti-apoptotic function of akt. our preliminary experiments have shown that a caspase-like protease is activated in eggs left unfertilized for several hours . the results suggest that fertilization is responsible for suppression of the caspase's activation. therefore, our future efforts will be directed at examining whether an anti-apoptotic mechanism is really operating in fertilized eggs and, if so, to clarify how and where akt is involved in this cellular function.

several studies have focused on the roles of sperm-associated pi 3-kinase in mammalian species. in human sperm, ly <dig> blocks the acrosome reaction  <cit>  and enhances motility  <cit> , but does not affect egg-sperm interaction  <cit> . more recently, jungnickel et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that in the mouse, the zona pellucida glycoprotein 3-induced acrosome reaction involves the pip3-dependent activation of akt. these results suggest that pi 3-kinase is required for ca2+ signaling in fertilizing sperm. in xenopus, however, no information has yet been available for the role of pi 3-kinase and/or akt in the acrosome reaction or other fertilization-related functions of sperm.

another important question is how pi 3-kinase could be activated after egg-sperm interaction/fusion ? in this connection, the fact that fertilization is accompanied by a transient accumulation of the p <dig> subunit of pi 3-kinase and thr308-phosphorylated form of akt in the egg membrane microdomains may be important. as we reported earlier, egg membrane microdomains are abundant in cholesterol, the ganglioside gm <dig>  and several signaling molecules, and serve as a platform for egg-sperm interaction and subsequent src-dependent signal transduction  <cit> . more recently, we have identified and characterized a membrane microdomain-associated protein, uroplakin iii, which might act as a target of sperm-derived protease and as a substrate of the activated src at fertilization  <cit> . although the signal transduction pathway connecting uroplakin iii and src is not yet known, the involvement of gtp-binding proteins has been inferred because the application of gtp to the isolated egg membrane microdomains could reconstitute the src activity in vitro . so, it is tempting to speculate that pi 3-kinase acts as a downstream target of gtp-binding proteins, as demonstrated in the case of γ-subspecies of pi 3-kinase  <cit> , so that gtp- and pip3-dependent activation of src is possible.

the specific activation of pi 3-kinase, however, is not necessarily required for egg activation signaling. rather, the rapid and transient accumulations of pi 3-kinase at membrane microdomains by itself maybe important. such a local concentration of pi 3-kinase may contribute to the effective propagation of pip3-dependent and ly294002-sensitive signals for egg activation. in support of this, pip <dig> is known to predominantly localize to membrane microdomains of mammalian cells  <cit> . further study should be directed toward analyzing the mechanism by which membrane microdomains allow the precise localization of these signaling molecules before and after fertilization.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that ly <dig> effectively inhibited several early steps of sperm-induced egg activation, including the activation of src. although we should keep in mind that the effect of ly <dig> could be mediated through other targets than pi 3-kinase, we think that the inhibitory effect of ly <dig> is most likely due to the inhibition of pi 3-kinase: because not only several steps of src-dependent egg activation but also sperm-induced phosphorylation of akt are inhibited by this inhibitor. pi 3-kinase and akt become activated and temporarily localize to the egg membrane microdomains where sperm-induced tyrosine kinase machinery operates for successful fertilization. these results highlight for the first time the important role the egg-associated pi 3-kinase plays in signal transduction for xenopus fertilization.
