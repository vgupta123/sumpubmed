BACKGROUND
soil salinization is a severe problem encountered worldwide in agricultural production that causes abiotic stress to plants and lowers crop growth and yields, thus impacting food security  <cit> . the accumulation of sodium in soils ultimately leads to high concentrations of sodium ions  within plant cells  <cit> . primary sources of salinity include natural processes such as mineral weathering or fluctuation of sea water levels, along with anthropogenic activities such as irrigation  <cit> . an overload of salinity in plants is known to cause a series of negative effects including reduction in water availability, mineral imbalances, and ultimately altered seed germination and plant metabolism  <cit> . given the world’s accelerating population growth and corresponding pressure on food supplies, this serious problem demands global solutions, such as improvement of the salt tolerance of crops  <cit> . thus, elucidating the molecular basis of salt-stress signal transduction pathways and salt tolerance mechanisms is fundamental to understanding the biology of salt-tolerant plants, in order to support strategies for the design, genetic engineering and breeding of salt-tolerant crops  <cit> .

plants have evolved complex signaling pathways in response to salt-stress, and have acquired plasticity in metabolic functions and developmental switches to cope with such changing environmental conditions . plant responses to signals are encoded by different ca2+ signatures. the major family of ca2+ sensors includes calmodulins , calcineurin b-like proteins , calcium-dependent protein kinases  and cbl interacting protein kinases . these sensors contribute to intricate signaling networks in plants, and they are encoded by complex families of genes  <cit> . considerable recent attention has been directed at explaining the molecular basis of plant salt tolerance. most studies have emphasized the significance of ca2+ signals in reinstating cellular ion homeostasis, demonstrating the importance of the calcium sensor and signaling pathways involved in salt stress signal transduction such as the cbl-cipk and cdpk pathways that were identified in arabidopsis and rice . research has shown that different, interconnected pathways may jointly coordinate regulation of plant responses to salt stress  <cit> .

pear trees  are cultivated widely throughout the world. they are the third most important fruit crop in temperate zones, after grape and apple  <cit> . the genome of this genus in the family rosaceae  was published recently; it contains  <dig>  genes, providing a rich resource for research by plant molecular biologists  <cit> . in recent years, the production of pears in southeast coast of china is reportedly quite limited due to further spread of soil salinization  <cit> . considerable effort has been directed at investigating salt stress in pear plants, especially its accumulation, translocation, and physiological and metabolic effects  <cit> . however, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the responses of pear plants to salt stress at the molecular level, especially regarding relationships among the key genes that control salt stress and calcium signaling pathways.

following release of the pear genome sequence, several studies have reported functional genomics research based on the analysis of transcription-level data. for example, rna-seq technology has been used to identify genes related to bud dormancy in p. pyrifolia, and to study transcriptome profiling of fruit development and maturation in p. bretschneideri ‘rehd’  . despite this obvious potential, to date, rna-seq analyses of the genome-wide responses of major genes involved in calcium signaling pathways under salt stress have not been assessed in pears.

our objective was to use the rna-seq technology platform to characterize the transcriptome of pear seedlings that were subjected to salt stress. a large set of transcript sequences for pear was obtained to identify the majority of activated genes involved in this process. the candidate genes involved in calcium signaling pathways were identified successfully, and the sequence of representative genes and expression patterns were further validated. the leaves de novo transcriptome based on rna-seq was comprehensively characterized in pear plants. this would provide a publicly available foundation of information to facilitate both an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate calcium signaling pathways in plants under salt stress, and the genetic improvement of traits governing fruit quality in molecular breeding programs for pear plants.

RESULTS
annotation of predicted proteins
among  <dig>  unique sequences that we identified,  <dig>  of them  significantly matched a sequence in at least one of the five public databases that we consulted . the rate of annotated unigenes was higher than the range of previous studies in other species , indicating the relative integrity and conserved functions of the assembled transcripts sequences in pear  <cit> . the size-distribution of the predicted proteins and coding sequence  are shown in additional file 1a and b, respectively. estscan was used to predict the coding regions of the remaining  <dig>  % of the unique sequences  that did not match any in the databases. an additional  <dig>  unique sequences  also showed orientation in the coding sequence . the absence of homologous sequences in public databases may indicate that novel genes are specifically expressed in pear leaves, or, it may be due to other biological or technical biases such as assembly parameters. moreover, the reason why some cdnas are non-coding or highly variable needs to be further explored  <cit> .table  <dig> summary statistics of functional annotation for pear unigenes in public databases



the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database showed that  <dig>  % of the mapped sequences had strong homology with the e-value < <dig> e− <dig>  whereas  <dig>  % of the homolog sequences ranged from  <dig> e− <dig> to  <dig> e− <dig>  the distribution of similarity values showed that  <dig>  % of the query sequences had a similarity of more than 80 %, while  <dig>  % of the hits had a similarity ranging from 17 % to 80 % . in terms of species distribution, the majority of the annotated sequences corresponded to known nucleotide sequences of plant species, with  <dig>  % of the sequences showing the highest homology to sequences from amygdalus persica, followed by fragaria vesca subsp. vesca , malus domestica  and vitis vinifera  . the two species with the most blast hits belonged to the rosaceae family, indicating that the sequences of the pear transcripts obtained in the present study were annotated properly  <cit> .fig.  <dig> characteristics of homology search for illumina sequences against the nr database. a e-value distribution of blast hits for matched unique sequences with an e-value cut-off of  <dig> e− <dig>  b similarity distribution of the top blast hits for each unique sequence. c species distribution is shown as the percentage of the total homologous sequences . within each of the three main categories of go classification, the dominant subcategories were “cellular process”  among biological processes, “cell”  among cellular components, and “catalytic activity”  among molecular functions. that is, the major go classifications involved in the annotated sequences controlled basic biological regulation and metabolism. these findings were consistent with previous studies of transcriptome analysis in radish roots and sweet potato tuberous roots  <cit> . cog classification was used to further evaluate the effectiveness of the annotation process and the completeness of the transcriptome library. a cog database was built from classifications of phylogenetic relationships, consisting of protein sequences encoded in  <dig> complete genomes including those of bacteria, eukaryotes and algae  <cit> . each cog classification consists of groups of paralogs or individual proteins from at least three lineages, and thus corresponds to an ancient conserved domain  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  of  <dig>   sequences were assigned to the cog classification . as some of these sequences were annotated with multiple cog functions, altogether  <dig>  functional annotations were generated. among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for “general function prediction only”  represented the largest group, followed by “transcription” , “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”  and “replication, recombination and repair” . the categories of “extracellular structures” and “nuclear structures” were the smallest groups .fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of gene ontology classification. the results are summarized as three main categories: biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions

the kegg pathway database can facilitate a systematic understanding of the molecular interactions among genes, in terms of networks  <cit> . pathway-based analysis enables further understanding of those biological functions. in order to identify the biological pathways active in pear, the unique sequences were annotated with kegg orthology  numbers from blastx alignments against the kegg database, using a cut-off e value of 10− <dig>  a total of  <dig>   annotated sequences were matched in the kegg database and were assigned to  <dig> active pathways. the five largest pathway groups were metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , plant-pathogen interactions , plant hormone signal transduction  and spliceosomes  . figure  <dig> shows the features of the pathway assignment based on kegg. the majority of the assigned unique sequences coded for related genes involved in primary metabolites, such as carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. however, only  <dig>  unique sequences that coded for the genes were associated with secondary metabolites. these annotations of protein or gene descriptions, putative conserved domains, and potential metabolic pathways will provide a valuable resource for subsequent investigation of specific processes, structures, biological functions and pathways in pear growth and development.fig.  <dig> pathway assignment based on kegg. pathways were assigned into five categories. a: metabolism; b: genetic information processing; c: environment information processing; d: cellular processes; e: organismal systems



identification of novel transcripts, snps, indel and alternative splicing events
during the rna-seq experiment, mrna-enriched rnas were firstly broken into short segments by chemical methods and then sequenced. read alignment to the reference genome was performed using the tophat/cufflinks/bowtie/soap and coding potential calculator  <cit> . gene coverage was calculated as the percentage of a gene covered by reads. this value is equal to the ratio of the base number in a gene covered by unique mapping reads to the total number of bases in the coding region of that gene  <cit> . a total of  <dig>   unique sequences with coverage between 90 %–100 % became the largest group, whereas no unique sequences were identified with coverage between 0 %–20 % . after demultiplexing, merging and filtering of reads, about  <dig>  million clean reads were obtained in the pdx sample of our experiment;  <dig>  % of the unique transcripts were sequenced and successfully mapped to the pear genome, and  <dig>  % were mapped to the de novo assembled results of pear . as previously reported, an unprecedentedly high number of novel transcripts have been discovered in the genomes of humans, mice, and many plant species  <cit> . in our research, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were presumably displaying potentially novel isoforms for all the transcripts . additionally, results from coding potential calculator analysis revealed that  <dig>  potentially novel transcripts had the ability to code proteins, but the specific functions of these proteins remain to be determined . in order to provide the best genome coverage for the analysis of performance and production traits, numerous snps are needed  <cit> . snps include transition and transversion of the nucleotide; in this study, among the  <dig>  snps found,  <dig>  %  were transitions between ‘a/g’ and ‘c/t’, whereas  <dig>  %  were transversions among ‘a/c, a/t, c/g and g/t’ . the snps identified in this report provide a highly useful baseline for further genetic studies in pear, and will contribute to the development of a high density snp array.fig.  <dig> gene coverage distribution of pdx. pie sections with different colors represent proportions of genes with certain coverage

in addition,  <dig>  insertion/deletion  were identified, including  <dig>  insertions and  <dig>  deletions, with a homozygous:heterozygous ratio of  <dig> . of the total, the proportion of single-base indels was highest , followed by double-base  and triple-base indels . the lengths of many indels were integral multiples of three bases, according to the indel length distribution . the indels were annotated according to the gene annotation information of birch-leaf pears. more than half of the indels were located in genic regions ; another  <dig>  were intergenic . among total  <dig>  indels,  <dig>   were within regions 2 kb upstream or downstream of genes, while  <dig> indels were more than 2 kb away from genes. furthermore,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   indels among total  <dig>  indels were located within cds, utr and introns respectively, and  <dig>   indels led to frameshifts .

the splicing of precursor mrna not only reconstitutes gene coding sequences, but it is also an important regulatory step in the process of gene expression in plants  <cit> . alternative splicing is a major means of increasing the transcriptome and proteome diversity in plants or mammals for a given number of genes  <cit> . rna-seq provides an efficient opportunity to investigate alternative splicing, which has revealed numerous instances of alternative splicing in mammals and plants  <cit> . we found evidence of  <dig>  alternative splicing events, and ir was the major splicing pattern detected , while es was rare . the number of genes involved in the four types of alternative splicing were  <dig> for es,  <dig>  for ir,  <dig>  for a5ss, and  <dig>  for a3ss . these alignment results and analysis represented a significant improvement over the previous genome annotation and enabled us to further investigate gene expression profiles.

identification of genes involved in myb transcription factors
myb transcription factors have been implicated in controlling cell development by responding to varieties of biotic and abiotic stresses, and by being involved in signal transduction processes of plant growth, including calcium signaling pathways  <cit> . it has also been reported that promoters of related genes in calcium signaling pathways usually contain the same cis-acting elements, indicating that these promoters can be regulated by the same transcription factors  <cit> . the expression of the genes in calcium signaling pathways is regulated by the transcription regulation gene, thereby significantly improving the resistance of plants to salt stress. for example, myb <dig> in boea crassifolia, myb <dig> in oryza sativa and myb <dig> in chrysanthemum spp. showed a response to salt stress . soybean myb transcription factors were also identified as being part of the stress tolerance apparatus based on salt stress assays in transgenic plants  <cit> . from the pear transcriptome analysis in this study, a total of  <dig> unique sequences were predicted to code myb proteins including a large number of members . however, the specific function of each particular myb member in calcium signaling pathways or salt-stress responses in pear needs to be verified using a functional genomics approach.

identification of genes involved in the calcium signaling pathways of pear
previous studies suggest that ca2+ plays an important role in the signal transduction pathway of eukaryotes  <cit> . in plants, intracellular calcium levels are altered in response to various environmental stresses, including high concentrations of salts  <cit> . an additional level of regulation in calcium signaling is achieved via the action of calcium-binding proteins, including cdpks, cams, cmls and cbls  <cit> . based on the genes currently known to be involved in calcium signaling pathways in a. thaliana and rice,  <dig> unigenes in our transcriptome dataset were found to be homologous to the previously identified genes encoding calcium-binding proteins. the results indicated that those genes control responses to salt stress signals, and that the function is relatively conserved among different species. moreover, four unigenes were found to be homologous to the genes encoding calcineurin b-like protein , which plays a critical role in responses to salt stress. in most cases, more than one unique sequence was annotated as encoding the same protein; such sequences may represent different members of a gene family and/or fragments of a single transcript  <cit> .

cams play important roles in the regulation of growth, development and abiotic stress resistance and they have been identified in several plant species . the cml family is likely to have evolved from cams. genome-wide identification of a. thaliana and rice has revealed that cam and cml proteins are typically encoded by gene families. the a. thaliana genome harbors  <dig> cam and  <dig> cml genes that encode potential calcium sensors  <cit> . in our annotated pear transcriptome unigene dataset,  <dig> sequences were successfully identified that corresponded to seven homologous cam genes  and  <dig> sequences that encoded calmodulin-like proteins .

cbl proteins fulfill crucial functions in diverse ca2+-dependent processes in plants. cbl-cipk complexes are instrumental in relaying plant responses to many environmental signals and in regulating ion fluxes . genome analyses have revealed that  <dig> cbls that specifically interact with distinct family members of the  <dig> cipks form a network-like signaling system for specific stimulus–response coupling  <cit> . our study finally discovered four unigene sequences that encode cbls and  <dig> sequences that encode cipks .

among several known classes of ca2+ binding sensory proteins, cdpks are the best characterized and they are particularly important. currently, most of the known calcium-stimulated protein kinase activities in plants are associated with cdpks. analysis of the genome sequence of arabidopsis has indicated the presence of  <dig> cdpks  <cit> . based on sequence similarities, a total of  <dig> unigenes ranging from 151 bp to 1536 bp in the rna-seq dataset were identified as cdpks, including cdpk <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

validation and expression analysis of genes involved in calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways
full-length cdna sequences of four selected genes from cbls in ca2+ dependent signal transduction pathways were isolated by t-a cloning, and compared with the unique sequences to check the quality of the annotation data from solexa sequencing. the full cdna length of these genes varied from 639 bp to 801 bp and the dna length ranged from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. overall, the assembled unique sequences covered more than 98 % of the corresponding genome and the sequence variation was minimal , which confirmed that the rna-seq based procedures of next generation sequencing were reliable .table  <dig> sequence analyses of the four pear genes involved in ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways

to further investigate the expression of genes involved in ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways, rt-qpcr analysis was performed on eight selected genes, including four cbl genes  and six cdpk genes , to provide detailed analysis of the effects of different concentrations of nacl  after treatment for 6 h. several genes involved in calcium signaling pathways showed distinct patterns of expression in different species undergoing salt stress, such as cbl genes in a. thaliana and populus , and cdpk genes in a. thaliana, oryza sativa, triticum aestivum, nicotiana tabacum and glycine max . the expression of all these genes in pear leaves varied with nacl concentration . levels of pdcbl <dig> declined gradually as the strength of nacl treatment increased. expressions of the remaining genes were all up-regulated compared to the control, except that pdcbl <dig> showed down-regulated in response to nacl exposure for  <dig> and 200 mm and pdcbl <dig> was down-regulated at 400 mm.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr expression analyses of  <dig> selected gene expression levels under different nacl treatments. x axes indicate nacl concentration. y axes indicate relative expression level of each selected gene. different letters indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  according to duncan’s multiple range tests



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, ngs-based rna sequencing for transcriptome methods  was employed to characterize the responses of pear plants exposed to salt stress. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were annotated successfully by blastx analysis using several publicly available protein databases. the main genes that were activated following the exposure of pear leaves to salt were predominately involved in basic biological processes, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, signal transduction mechanisms, and other cellular components and molecular functions . additionally,  <dig>  % of the unique transcripts were sequenced and successfully mapped to the pear genome, and  <dig>  % were mapped to the de novo assembled results of pear. furthermore, a total of  <dig>  novel transcripts,  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels were identified successfully, and  <dig>  alternative splicing events occurred. these findings demonstrated that the rna-seq based technology is a rapid and cost-effective method for novel gene discovery in pear plants. the coverage of pear unigenes was comprehensive enough to allow for the discovery of almost all genes known to be involved in calcium signaling transduction and related pathways. the transcriptome dataset generated by this study will facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms via the regulation of calcium signaling. it will also provide experimental data useful for the development of salinity resistance in pear breeding programs.
