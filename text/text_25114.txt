BACKGROUND
salvia species have attracted great attention due to their biologically active constituents  <cit> . two major groups of secondary metabolites are produced in salvia species; terpenoids and polyphenolics. diterpenes is the largest group comprising  <dig> of  <dig> presently identified salvia sp. constituents, with labdanes being the main metabolites  <cit> . carnosol and carnosic acid, two diterpenes naturally found in sage and rosemary, have been evaluated for their anti-inflammatory  <cit> , antioxidant  <cit>  and anticancer properties  <cit> . tanshinones, naturally found in s. miltiorrhiza roots, are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases . they are a mix of chemical compounds mainly consisting of tanshinone i, tanshinone iia, cryptotanshinone and dihydrotanshinone having various biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory  <cit> , antibacterial  <cit> , antioxidant  <cit>  and antineoplastic . so far, extracts of s. miltiorrhiza roots have been successfully enrolled in clinical trials for coronary heart disease  <cit> , pulmonary hypertension  <cit>  and polycystic ovary syndrome  <cit> .

in plants, terpenes are synthesized via two pathways: the mevalonate pathway in the cytosol and the 2-c-methyl-d- erythritol-4-phosphate  pathway in the plastids. the main building block of terpenes is an isoprene unit that is derived from isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate . then, by the action of prenyltransferases on ipp and dmapp, the higher building blocks of terpenes are generated: geranyl diphosphate  for monoterpene synthesis, -farnesyl diphosphate  for sesquiterpene and -geranylgeranyl diphosphate  for diterpene synthesis  <cit> . diterpenes are mainly synthesized via the mep pathway; nevertheless a crosstalk between the pathways has been reported  <cit> .

tanshinones and carnosic acid, derive from the universal diterpenoid precursor ggpp that is subsequently converted to copalyl diphosphate  by the action of cdp synthase. additional cyclization catalyzed by a class i terpene synthase  results in the formation of miltiradiene  <cit> . subsequently, the action of cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases, such as cyp76ah <dig> from s. miltiorrhiza  <cit>  or cyp76ah <dig> from r. officinalis  <cit> , catalyzes the synthesis of ferruginol, a potential precursor of carnosic acid which in turn may be an intermediate to tanshinone biosynthesis  <cit> . due to the biological significance of carnosol, carnosic acid and tanshinones, there is increasing need for improved or alternative methods of production of these metabolites. as a result, efforts aiming to elucidate the related biosynthetic pathways has led to the identification of several enzymatic steps, not only in s. miltiorrhiza  <cit>  but also in other species  <cit> . specifically, diterpene synthases catalyzing the same enzymatic reactions with smcds and smksl have been identified in rosmarinus officinalis  <cit>  and in salvia fruticosa  <cit> . identification of ferruginol synthase in s. miltiorrhiza, r. officinalis and s. fruticosa enabled the synthesis of ferruginol in yeast cells  <cit> . aiming to reconstruct tanshinone biosynthesis in yeast, expression of s. miltiorrhiza ferruginol synthase cyp76ah <dig> in a dedicated strain resulted in  <dig>  mg/l of ferruginol  <cit> .

in the current study, we conducted a combined metabolome and transcriptome analysis of s. pomifera leaves and leaf trichomes, respectively, in order to provide an insight into isoprenoid pathway and identify key enzymes involved in terpene biosynthesis. metabolite analysis of s. pomifera leaf extracts led to the identification and isolation of several carnosic acid-related metabolites, suggested that transcriptomic analysis may yield important insights into the biosynthesis of these compounds. two genes that appeared to be likely involved in miltiradiene synthesis, a copalyl diphosphate synthase  and a miltiradiene synthase  were cloned and expressed in s. cerevisiae and their products were characterized. furthermore, from the full transcriptomic profile of s. pomifera’s, we identified the cyps providing a useful insight on the subsequent biosynthetic steps.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of diterpenes from s.pomifera leaves
specimens of s. pomifera from the areas of topolia  and aptera  were collected and the constituents of their aerial parts were extracted. a series of chromatographic separations of the organic extracts resulted in the isolation of one new  and five previously reported metabolites, which were identified as pisiferic acid , o-methyl-pisiferic acid , 12-methoxycarnosic acid , carnosol , and salviol  , by comparison of their spectroscopic and physical characteristics with those reported in the literature .fig.  <dig> structures and biosynthesis of the main diterpenes found in s. pomifera leaves. a the names of the isolated compounds from s. pomifera leaves are:  2α-hydroxy-o-methyl-pisiferic acid,  pisiferic acid,  o-methyl-pisiferic acid,  12-methoxycarnosic acid,  carnosol and  salviol. b the proposed biosynthetic pathway of carnosic acid-family metabolites: geranylgeranyl diphosphate  is subjected to cyclization by a class ii diterpene synthase to form copalyl diphosphate -cpp). then, by the action of a class i diterpene synthase, miltiradiene is formed. subsequent oxidation and cytochrome p <dig> activity results in the formation of ferruginol. figure was produced using chemescketch v  <dig> 



the molecular formula of compound  <dig>  isolated as a white solid, was determined to be c21h30o <dig> on the basis of its hr-esi-ms data. the spectroscopic characteristics of metabolite  <dig> were rather similar to those of compounds 2– <dig>  indicating an abietane skeleton. its 1h nmr spectrum included signals for two aromatic protons resonating at δ  <dig>  and  <dig> , one oxygenated methine at δ  <dig> , one oxymethyl at δ  <dig> , two singlet methyls at δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  and two doublet methyls at δ  <dig>  and  <dig>  . analysis of the correlations observed in the hsqc, cosy and hmbc spectra led to the complete assignment of the protons and carbons of the molecule, while the relative configuration was proposed on the basis of noe enhancements. in particular, the heteronuclear correlations of c- <dig> with h-1α and h- <dig> indicated the position of the carboxylic acid at c- <dig>  while the correlations of c- <dig> with the protons of the oxymethyl and h- <dig> indicated the position of the methoxy group at c- <dig>  furthermore, the heteronuclear correlations of c- <dig> and c- <dig> with h- <dig> and of c- <dig> and c- <dig> with h- <dig> indicated the position of the aromatic protons. the noe interactions of h- <dig> with the protons of the oxymethyl and h-1α and of h- <dig> with h2- <dig>  h3- <dig> and h3- <dig> further confirmed the position of the aromatic protons. additionally, the noe interactions of h- <dig> with h-1β, h-3β and h3- <dig>  in combination with the coupling constants of h- <dig> determined the equatorial orientation of the hydroxyl group at c- <dig>  thus, compound  <dig> was identified as 2α-hydroxy-o-methyl-pisiferic acid. the 1h-nmr and 13c-nmr spectra of 2α-hydroxy-o-methyl-pisiferic acid are provided as additional file 1: figure s <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig> along with the 1h-nmr spectra of pisiferic acid , o-methyl-pisiferic acid , 12-methoxycarnosic acid , carnosol  and salviol .table  <dig>

these structures of carnosic acid- family metabolites seem to be derived from ferruginol via miltiradiene and abietatriene . the presence of small amounts of ferruginol in extracts of the aerial parts of s. pomifera  supports this hypothesis. in order to elucidate the biosynthesis of these compounds, we proceeded with the analysis of the transcriptome of s. pomifera glandular trichomes.

transcriptome sequencing, de novo assembly and sequence clustering of s. pomifera trichome transcripts
sequencing of s. pomifera leaf trichomes resulted in approximately  <dig> , <dig> raw reads from which nearly 85 % were of high quality. the results of the rna-seq regarding the throughput and the quality of s. pomifera leaf’s trichome libraries are included in table  <dig>  high quality reads were assembled into contigs using the standard pipeline of the trinity suite software  <cit> . a k-mer catalogue was produced by jellyfish software and used as input for inchworm to assemble the contigs. subsequently, reads were mapped back to the assembled contigs to improve assembly using bowtie. in total,  <dig>  contigs were assembled with a mean length of 321 nt . these contigs were re-assembled into  <dig>  larger contigs of 640 nt mean length; however the majority of the contigs was less than 600 nt in length . from these,  <dig>  were clustered in clusters of contigs  and  <dig>  remained as singletons  in the final trinity output produced by the coordinated action of chrysalis and butterfly software. contigs with less than 600 nt in length had in average  <dig> total reads mapped in each contig.table  <dig> an overview of the rna-seq outcome including numbers for total raw, high quality reads and nucleotides and the statistical q <dig>  n and gc percentages




functional annotation and transcript expression in trichomes
s. pomifera contigs were employed in blast searches against several biological databases for their annotation. 70 % of the s. pomifera contigs had a non-redundant  ncbi blast hit, while the percentage of the sequences that were annotated based on gene ontology  was  <dig>  %. the percentages of the sequences annotated based on blast searches against the nucleotide database , swiss-prot and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , were similar;  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively. much lower was the percentage of s. pomifera contigs that were assigned to clusters of orthologous groups ,  <dig>  %.

most of the contigs that had a hit against the nr protein database shared significant similarity, 37 %, with vitis vinifera sequences, 13 % were similar to ricinus communis sequences,  <dig>  % to populus trichocarpa, 8 % to glycine max and  <dig>  % to other plants. the majority of the contigs,  <dig>  %, showed a similarity level of 60–80 % with proteins from the nr database and 21 % of the contigs had a similarity with proteins that extended beyond 80 %.

among the  <dig>  transcripts with at least one go-term assigned, the highest percentage of transcripts in the cellular component ontology were annotated in the cell/cell part class  in the molecular function ontology the majority of the transcripts were in binding  while in the biological process ontology most of the transcripts were grouped in the cellular process class . the detailed classification of the unigenes in the individual go-terms of the three go ontology domains is depicted in fig.  <dig>  similar results were obtained from the go-analysis of transcripts sequenced from glandular and non-glandular tomato stem trichomes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the go annotation of s. pomifera leaf trichomes contigs. assignment of s. pomifera contigs on gene ontologies: biological process, cellular component and molecular function and their sub-categories



furthermore,  <dig>  s. pomifera transcripts were classified into  <dig> cog functional categories. for most of the transcripts only a general function prediction was made while the next two most abundant categories were transcription and post-translational modification, protein turnover and chaperones. extracellular and nuclear structures are the two cog categories with the smallest number of assigned transcripts. the complete classification of s. pomifera transcripts according to cog is depicted in fig.  <dig>  the identity of the most expressed transcripts in s. pomifera leaf trichomes, their top nr blast hits, and their go annotation are presented in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> classification of s. pomifera transcripts in the  <dig> cog categories




most of the s. pomifera contigs that are strongly expressed in leaf trichomes share significant similarity with annotated nr sequences. among them, two abundantly expressed s. pomifera contigs are involved in secondary metabolism; cl <dig> contig <dig>  encoding the previously characterized sabinene synthase  <cit>  with one amino acid difference, and cl.contig <dig>  coding for a full length protein that is highly similar to cinnamoyl coa reductase . apart from the annotated transcripts, unigene <dig>  cl <dig> contig <dig>  unigene <dig>  cl <dig> contig <dig> and cl <dig> contig <dig> produced no hits versus nr ncbi database and they were used in further blast searches in the european nucleotide archive  database. unigene  <dig>  is highly similar to mrna sequence fe <dig> extracted from leaf trichomes of another greek salvia species, s. fruticosa. transcript cl <dig> contig <dig>  has only one nucleotide change to mrna sequence fe <dig>  from leaf trichomes of s. fruticosa cl <dig>  contig <dig>  blasts against another s. fruticosa leaf trichome cdna clone of ena database  with almost perfect identity. all the above sequences lack annotation which was also observed for a large number of transcripts in the trichomes of mentha spicata  <cit> .

expression analysis of genes involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis
several s. pomifera contigs were predicted to code for proteins that participate in the terpenoid precursor biosynthesis pathway . terpenoid biosynthesis in plants is carried out via two pathways: the mevalonate pathway  in the cytosol and the non-mevalonate or 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway  in the plastids. in fig.  <dig>  the two terpenoid biosynthetic pathways are depicted with their identified corresponding enzymes and the number of contigs that putatively code for these enzymes in the present transcriptomic analysis. the first protein/enzyme of the plastid mep pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase  is encoded by seven contigs;  <dig> contigs that contain a partial and  <dig> contig with a full orf. another important enzyme of the pathway, the 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase  is encoded by 9 s. pomifera contigs. on the other hand, enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase  of the mva pathway is encoded by  <dig> contigs.fig.  <dig> graphical representation of the two pathways, mva and mep, by which plant terpenes are produced. the kegg entries of the specific enzymes that participate in the pathways are shown in red as alongside the number of contigs identified that putatively encode for these enzymes



the expression levels of the full or nearly full s. pomifera orfs involved in terpenoid biosynthesis are presented in fig.  <dig>  the most expressed transcript of the mep pathway is unigene <dig>  which encodes for a dxs protein and shares high similarity  with dxs <dig> from s. miltiorrhiza . the fpkm value for unigene <dig> - putative dxs <dig> is  <dig> . in the mva pathway, the highest expressed transcript is cl <dig> contig <dig>  that encodes for a putative hmgr protein and has 87 % similarity with hmgr <dig> from s. miltiorrhiza . the fpkm value for cl <dig> contig <dig> - putative hmgr <dig> is  <dig> , nearly double than that of unigene <dig> of the mep pathway. the second most abundant is unigene <dig>  - fpkm value is  <dig>  - encodes for a hmgs protein almost identical to hmgs <dig> from s. miltiorrhiza . in general, the transcripts that are predicted to participate in the mep pathway are present at lower levels than the transcripts of the mva pathway. finally, 16 s. pomifera contigs are putative gpp, ggpp and fpp synthases. only one full length putative ggpps gene, cl <dig> contig <dig>  is included in fig.  <dig> with a rather moderate expression. Α putative fpps gene i.e., unigene <dig> that synthesizes fpp, the precursor of sesquiterpenes and triterpenes in the cell cytoplasm, is the most expressed among the prenyltransferases; its fpkm value is  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> expression heatmap of s. pomifera contigs. contigs that encode full or almost full length proteins and are putatively involved in the mep and mva pathways of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in the leaf trichomes. color bar at the bottom of the figure denotes color intensity according to global expression levels. abbreviations; dxs: 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, dxr: 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, mct: mep cytidyltransferase, cmk: 4--2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase, mds: 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate, hds: 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, hdr: 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase, hmg: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl, mvk: mevalonate kinase, pmk: phosphomevalonate kinase, mvd: diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, ippi: isopentenyl diphosphate, ippss: isoprenyl pyrophosphate synthases



diterpene biosynthesis typically consists of an initial cyclization of ggpp by a class ii ditps to produce a cyclic diphosphate intermediate, followed by conversion of this intermediate to the final diterpene skeleton by a class i ditps  <cit> . s. pomifera unigene <dig> that is abundantly expressed in trichomes , encodes for a protein that shares 97 % similarity  to s. fruticosa copalyl diphosphate synthase  , 90 % similarity to r. officinalis cds  and 87 % similarity to s. miltiorrhiza cds . s. pomifera cl <dig> cluster of contigs code for a diterpene synthase that was previously characterized as miltiradiene synthase   <cit> . cl <dig> contig <dig> that contains a full orf identical to miltiradiene synthase is sufficiently expressed in trichomes of s. pomifera .

identification, cloning and characterization of genes related to miltiradiene biosynthesis
expression analysis of unigene <dig> and cl <dig> transcripts was performed by quantitative real time pcr . elongation factor 1-a was used as reference gene to normalize cdna quantity. expression analysis for the isolated genes was performed on leaves, root and shoot samples of s. pomifera. as a reference tissue sample leaves were selected. the expression levels of all the other tissues were expressed as relatively fold-differences to leaves. as shown in fig.  <dig>  unigene <dig> is expressed only in leaves and more than  <dig> times less in the shoot of s. pomifera, while no expression was detected in the root. cl <dig> expression levels are  <dig> times lower in the roots compared to leaves and more than  <dig> times lower in the shoot compared to the leaves . high expression in leaves is anticipated; however the complete absence of expression of unigene <dig> in roots is surprising considering that in extractions from root tissues we have identified sufficient amount of ferruginol . it is likely that an alternative  cds gene may be responsible for labdane diterpene synthesis in the root.fig.  <dig> relative expression of s. pomifera genes related to miltiradiene biosynthesis. relative expression of miltiradiene synthase  and copalyl diphosphate synthase  in shoot, root and leaves of s. pomifera. expression levels are depicted relatively in shoot and root compared to leaves expression



the s. pomifera unigene  <dig> encoding for a putative copalyl diphosphate synthase  was pcr amplified using gene specific primers and introduced into the yeast expression vector putdh3myc, while the class i terpene synthase gene cl <dig> was amplified and cloned into phtdh3myc  <cit> . for in vivo functional characterization, pseudomature protein was expressed in the yeast strain am <dig>   <cit>  together with the erg20p  variant protein capable of improved production of ggpp  <cit> . production of manool and copalol was observed in the yeast strain expressing the putative spcds. as proposed  <cit> , formation of manool and copalol is likely the result of acid or phosphatase-mediated hydrolysis, respectively, of excess of copalyl diphosphate . the identity of manool and copalol was verified by comparison of the retention time and mass-spectrum with authentic standard . co-expression of the putative miltiradiene synthase  with spcds in am <dig> yeast cells expressing the erg20p variant resulted in the production of miltiradiene , confirmed by comparison of the retention time and mass-spectrum with authentic standard . miltiradiene titers under these conditions reached 32 mg/l , comparable with the previously reported ones  <cit> . therefore, biosynthesis of miltiradiene was reproduced in heterologous yeast by employing the corresponding class ii diterpene synthase, spcds, responsible for biosynthesis of copalyl diphosphate and the class i diterpene synthase, spmils .fig.  <dig>

cytochrome p450s
cytochrome p450s is one of the largest families in plant metabolism and are responsible for the high chemical diversity of plant metabolites  <cit> . they are heme containing enzymes that catalyze the introduction of atmospheric oxygen into non-activated carbon-hydrogen bonds in a stereo- and regio-selective manner  <cit> . the transcriptomic analysis of s. pomifera trichomes revealed a number of cyps either of full or partial length . all cyps were sent to professor david nelson for annotation  <cit> . the expression levels along with the annotation of s. pomifera cyps are presented on table  <dig>  the highest transcribed cyps are spcyp76ah <dig> ortholog  , spcyp76ak <dig>  , spcyp71be <dig>   and sp716a <dig>   . furthermore, several additional cyps were identified having high expression levels such as spcyp86a <dig> ortholog  , spcyp71d <dig> , sp73a <dig> ortholog  and spcyp93b <dig> ortholog .table  <dig> classification of s. pomifera cyps according to their corresponding fpkm values produced by the rsem software. the annotation of transcripts was kindly provided by prof. david nelson. all transcripts are full length unless otherwise stated;  or : complete or partial variant of the transcript




the highest transcribed cyp, spcyp76ah <dig> ortholog , was found to be homologous  to s. miltiorrhiza cyp76ah <dig>  that catalyzes the synthesis of ferruginol  <cit> . spcyp76ah <dig> ortholog encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids that is almost identical  to the ferruginol synthase from s. fruticosa   <cit>  and highly homologous  to cyp76ah <dig>  the ferruginol synthase from r. officinalis   <cit> . it is suggested that miltiradiene spontaneously aromatizes to abietatriene, which is then hydroxylated by ferruginol synthase to yield ferruginol, the precursor of other labdane-related terpenes like carnosol and tanshinones  <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis of cyps revealed that the majority belong to the cyp <dig> clan while the rest of transcripts are categorized to the clans cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  clans cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> have one member each while cyp <dig> has two members as demonstrated on the phylogenetic tree . the clustering of families of s. pomifera’s cyps on the phylogenetic tree comes to verify the rooted relationships of clans. for instance, the proximity of cyp <dig> with cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> with cyp <dig> implies a possible evolution from a common ancestor  <cit> . members of the cyp <dig> clan were shown to be close phylogenetically with enzymes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis. two members of the cyp <dig> family, sp76ak <dig> and sp76g <dig> ortholog are phylogenetically close with sm76ak <dig> and sm76g <dig>  respectively, suggesting an involvement in diterpenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . on the other hand, spcyp71d <dig> showed high similarity with cyp71d <dig> from hyoscyamus muticus that is designated as premnaspirodiene oxidase  <cit>  in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. regarding monoterpenes, spcyp71au <dig> ortholog  and spcyp81b <dig> ortholog are probably involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenoids  <cit> . along with clan cyp <dig>  one member from cyp <dig> clan, spcyp728d <dig> ortholog  is probably involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . from the cyp <dig> clan, according to the computational expression analysis, the highest expressed transcripts are sp716a <dig>   and spcyp716a <dig> ; both belonging to cyp716a subfamily which have been shown to be involved in diterpenoid  <cit>  and triterpenoids biosynthesis  <cit> . in general, members of the cyp <dig> clan have been shown to be involved in the metabolism of medium to large isoprenoids  <cit> . the majority of clan cyp <dig> members are orthologous to their counterparts from s. miltiorrhiza  <cit>  with spcy96a <dig> ortholog, spcyp94a <dig> ortholog and spcyp96a <dig> having the highest expression among them.fig.  <dig> a neighbor-joining tree of s. pomifera’s cyps. phylogenetic analysis of s. pomifera cytochrome p450s. green labels represents s. pomifera cyps and red labels represent the different clans. among gene variants the full length one  was chosen when possible otherwise the most transcipted partial variant 



besides isoprenoid metabolism, specific transcripts were identified to be orthologous to s. miltiorrhiza’s cyps that are probably involved in rosmarinic acid pathway. sp73a <dig> ortholog and spcyp98a <dig> ortholog have been identified as cinnamate 4-hydroxylase and β-coumaryl-coa 3′-hydroxylase respectively, two key enzymes in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis in s. miltiorrhiza  <cit> .

discussion
labdane diterpenes have important health promoting properties. carnosic acid-related compounds from rosemary and sage have attracted attention not only as potent antioxidants but also as antibacterial, antiparasitic and cytotoxic compounds  while tanshinones from s. miltiorrhiza roots have a plethora of bioactive properties  <cit> . the biosynthesis of carnosic acid and tanshinones is still unclear. although ferruginol appears to be a common intermediate, the following steps and the point where these pathways disentangle are not yet known. interestingly, it has been proposed that tanshinone biosynthesis may proceed through carnosic acid  <cit> , although this claim has not since been validated. elucidating the biosynthesis of these compounds will be an important step towards their biotechnological production in engineered microorganisms.

in the present study, thorough metabolite analysis of s. pomifera leaves led to the isolation and identification of several metabolites from the carnosic acid family . to elucidate their biosynthesis, the transcriptome of s. pomifera glandular trichomes was sequenced to obtain approximately  <dig> , <dig> raw reads that were assembled into contigs and annotated. expression analysis of the transcripts involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis showed higher expression of the genes participating in the mva pathway in comparison to the mep pathway. these findings are in contrast to previous observations from s. miltiorrhiza where it was shown that mep related transcripts were mainly expressed in the leaf while mva-related transcripts were mainly expressed in the root  <cit> .

in addition to isoprenoid biosynthesis, several highly expressed transcripts that were identified in the trichomes of s. pomifera are highly similar to s. fruticosa ones indicating that they probably play important roles in this specialized tissue which could be investigated further. other contigs that code for photosynthetic related proteins such as ribulose biphosphate carboxylase  and chlorophyll-binding proteins are among the most expressed in trichomes. similarly, such ests coding for proteins involved in photosynthesis have also been found among the most expressed genes in the trichomes of artemisia annua, the asian medicinal plant that produces the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin  <cit> . the abundant expression of photosynthesis related genes in the trichomes transcriptome of s. pomifera is also in accordance with data from other plant species such as several solanum species - both wild and domesticated - in which photosynthetic genes were also highly expressed in glandular trichomes  <cit> . s. pomifera trichomes are possibly capable of synthesizing secondary metabolites without the need for carbon transport from leaves. the opposite has been suggested by jin et al.  <cit>  for the peltate glandular trichomes of spearmint, m. spicata, described as poor in genes related to photosynthesis and chlorophyll formation. we proceeded to reassemble and analyze the deposited m. spicata transcriptome data and compared them to the s. pomifera ones. data analysis of the m. spicata transcriptome sequencing showed that two genes coding for rubisco and chlorophyll binding proteins are also highly expressed in the trichomes of m. spicata. the common high expressed genes between s. pomifera and m. spicata are indicated in bold in the additional file 9: table s <dig> that includes the complete list of m. spicata most expressed transcripts as a result of our analysis. with regard to photosynthetic competence, the possibility of leaf cells contaminating trichome samples cannot be ruled out, though no such tissue could be seen by visual and microscopic observation of the trichomes destined for s. pomifera ngs sequencing.

the transcriptomic analysis pointed two highly expressed diterpene synthases, spcds and spmils, that were cloned and expressed in the appropriate yeast platform yielding 32 mg/l miltiradiene, that is in accordance with previously reported ones  <cit>  . the abundance of spcds and spmils was further supported from the expression analysis by qpcr in three different tissue organs of s. pomifera  that showed high expression in leaves and poor or zero expression in other tissues. this might be explained by the fact that carnosic acid is mainly stored in the glandular trichomes of the leaves  <cit> , thus a higher expression of the relevant enzymes is expected. on the contrary, their homologues in s. miltiorrhiza, smcps and smksl, were shown to be abundantly expressed in roots, which is expected since tanshinones accumulation takes place in that specific tissue  <cit> .

along with terpene synthases, cyps are the key enzymes contributing to the diversification of terpenoids. they are a highly diverse family of enzymes catalyzing various reactions  <cit>  responsible for the chemical diversity of secondary metabolites of the plant kingdom. terpene synthases create the terpene scaffold giving rise to a variety of metabolites  <cit> , while cyps undertake further modification of the scaffold increasing the diversity of the resulting terpenes. study of terpene synthases along with cyps is essential since a non random functional association of these two families has been revealed  <cit> . thus, having available the whole transcriptomic profile of cyps is of a great significance.

the transcriptomic analysis of s. pomifera trichomes revealed a significant number of highly transcribed cyps, with spcyp76ah <dig> ortholog being the highest among them. spcyp76ah <dig> ortholog showed high similarity to ferruginol synthases from other lamiaceae species; 99 % identity to s. fruticosa ferruginol synthase, 91 % identity to r. officinalis cyp76ah <dig> and almost 80 % homology to s. miltiorhhiza cyp76ah <dig>  the predicted protein from spcyp76ah <dig> ortholog has a full pp <dig> domain  that extends from position  <dig> to position  <dig> and due to its similarity with the known lamiaceae cyp76ahs, it is highly possible to produce ferruginol in s. pomifera.

phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome p450s showed that the majority of cyps belong to cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans as was anticipated  <cit> . it was previously shown that cyps involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis likely originate from cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clan. cyp <dig> clan members are mainly involved in the metabolism of specialized metabolites like monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes substrates  <cit>  as well as in the metabolism of aromatic and aliphatic amino acids, alkaloids, fatty acids and precursors of hormones  <cit> . cyp <dig> clan includes the majority of the cyp <dig> families that are involved in the plant secondary metabolism  <cit> . cyp71a family proteins participate in monoterpenoids oxidation even though it has been suggested that may be highly specialized in their roles in diverse plant species  <cit> . on the other hand, cyp <dig> family is mainly involved in isoprenoid metabolism  <cit>  although members of this family have also been implicated in herbicide metabolism in arabidopsis  <cit>  and in the biosynthesis of defense compounds in thuja plicata  <cit> . clans cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> are involved in the metabolism of both general and specialized metabolites  <cit> . besides isoprenoid metabolism, two member enzymes were annotated as orthologous to smcyp98a <dig> and smcyp73a <dig> that are - a β-coumaryl-coa 3′-hydroxylase and a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase respectively, key enzymes in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
over the past years, tanshinones and carnosic family metabolites, have gained great attention due to their unique properties. thus, elucidation of their biosynthetic pathway is of great importance as it will unlock the key enzymes involved in their synthesis. the transcriptome analysis of s. pomifera trichomes revealed two genes involved in miltiradiene synthesis; a copalyl diphosphate synthase  and a miltiradiene synthase . furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis of several cytochrome p450s provided useful insights in the biosynthetic mechanism responsible for the production of carnosic acid-family metabolites in s. pomifera. setting up a resource of cyp <dig> genes from s. pomifera not only provides information on terpenoid biosynthesis but also assists in mining genes involved in the production of other natural products.
