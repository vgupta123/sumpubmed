BACKGROUND
nox enzymes  diverged early in evolution into calcium-regulated noxes  and noxes that are activated by binding to regulatory subunits  <cit> . the most extensively studied of the latter is the phagocyte napdh-oxidase , whose role in host defense has been documented at length  <cit> . professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages produce large amounts of superoxide, with secondary production of other microbicidal reactive oxygen species . superoxide is generated by the phox, which consists of the catalytic subunit gp91phox , along with the regulatory subunits p22phox, p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and the small gtpase, rac  <cit> . the importance of the oxidase is demonstrated by the inherited condition, chronic granulomatous disease , in which absent or mutated phox proteins result in an inability of phagocytes to kill microbes  <cit> .

nox <dig> and p22phox are integral membrane proteins that form a heterodimer referred to as flavocytochrome b <dig>  in resting cells, flavocytochrome b <dig> is inactive and p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox are all present in the cytoplasm. cell activation is accompanied by phosphorylation of p47phox and probably other phox-regulatory subunits  <cit> , and by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that convert rac-gdp to rac-gtp  <cit> . these events trigger assembly of these proteins at the membrane, resulting in activation of nox <dig>  an intricate set of protein-protein interactions facilitates the binding of the regulatory subunits to the membrane components and to each other, and these interactions are mediated by well-characterized modular interaction domains. for example, p47phox and p67phox bind via a c-terminal proline-rich region  in p47phox and a c-terminal src homology  <dig>  domain in p67phox  <cit> . in the non-activated cell, the p47phox-p67phox complex fails to bind to flavocytochrome b <dig>  due to an unusual autoinhibitory mechanism. in the resting cell, tandem sh <dig> domains in p47phox  bind to an auto-inhibitory region , preventing the bis-sh <dig> domain from binding to the prr of p22phox. upon cell activation, serine residues of the air become phosphorylated, releasing the bis-sh <dig> domain so that it can now bind to p22phox  <cit> . in addition, p47phox possesses another membrane-binding region, the px domain, which binds to the headgroups of phosphatidylinositols present in the membrane  <cit> . together, these interactions with membrane lipids and p22phox promote the assembly of p47phox and p67phox with flavocytochrome b <dig>  concurrently, rac-gtp translocates to the membrane where it interacts with the n-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat  region of p67phox  <cit> . an activation domain  in p67phox, which is conformationally regulated by rac binding  <cit> , activates the hydride transfer from nadph to fad in nox <dig>  subsequent electron transfer through two heme groups permits reduction of oxygen to form superoxide  <cit> . p40phox binds through its phox/bem  <dig>  domain to a partner pb <dig> domain in p67phox and facilitates the assembly of p67phox-p47phox at the membrane through lipid binding via its px domain  <cit> . although no cgd patients have been described with mutations in p40phox, neutrophils from p40phox-knockout mice exhibit cgd-like severe defects in nox2-derived oxidant-dependent bacterial killing  <cit> , also suggesting that p40phox is a crucial component for nox <dig> function.

the first homologue of gp91phox identified was nox <dig>  which is abundantly expressed in non-phagocyte cells including gastrointestinal epithelium and vascular smooth muscle  <cit> . subsequently, additional homologues were identified, and the nox/duox family in humans now consists of seven members: nox <dig> though nox <dig>  duox <dig> and duox <dig>  <cit> . all members of nox/duox family contain the six transmembrane α-helical heme-binding domain and an fad domain containing an nadph binding site, which together constitute the "nox domain" <cit> . nox <dig> and duox1/ <dig> contain a calcium-binding ef-hand motif. the evolution of these noxes and their calcium-binding domains were considered in the recent article  <cit>  and are not discussed here. the remaining noxes, nox1- <dig>  require p22phox for activity, and nox1- <dig> all require additional phox-like regulatory subunits, reviewed recently  <cit> .

nox <dig>  like gp91phox, is activated by regulatory subunits: noxo <dig>  is a homologue of p47phox and noxa <dig>  is a homologue of p67phox  <cit> . recent studies have also demonstrated activation of the nox <dig> system by rac <dig>  <cit> . noxo <dig> and noxa <dig> are co-expressed with nox <dig> in colon epithelium and gastric mucosa  <cit> , consistent with in vivo regulation of nox <dig> by these novel subunits. activation of nox <dig> by regulatory subunits differs in two major respects compared to gp91phox. first, noxo <dig> lacks the air and its associated regulatory phosphorylation sites that are present in p47phox. consistent with the domain structure, noxo <dig> co-localizes with nox1/p22phox complex constitutively at/near the plasma membrane in vivo  <cit> . on the other hand, a recent study revealed that the bis-sh <dig> domain of noxo <dig> bind to the extremely c-terminal prr of noxo <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation-independent disruption of the intramolecular interaction facilitates noxo <dig> binding to the prr of p22phox. second, noxa <dig> lacks critical basic amino acid residues in its pb <dig> domain that are important for binding to p40phox. noxa <dig> does not interact with p40phox, making human nox <dig> activity independent of p40phox  <cit> . furthermore, human noxa <dig> lacks the central sh <dig> domain that is present in p67phox  <cit> , but whose function is unknown. like nox <dig>  nox <dig> is also regulated by p22phox and noxo <dig>  but in humans does not require noxa <dig>  <cit> . in comparison, nox <dig> requires p22phox for activity, but other known regulatory subunits are not needed  <cit> .

another subfamily of the noxes is the noxa/noxb group, found in a slime mold amoeba and fungi. these fungal nox genes have been identified in most ascomycetes except for hemiascomycete yeasts, and also in higher basidiomycetes and chytridiomycotes . no nox gene has been identified in fungi that belong to zygomycota and micropordia. these noxa/noxb genes are closely related to the subunit-regulated noxes according to taxonomy  <cit> . a non-animal homologue of p67phox/noxa <dig> was described in slime mold amoeba dictyostelium discoideum   <cit> . the p67phox homolog  of d. discoideum possesses the n-terminal tpr region and pb <dig> domain characteristic of p67phox, but lacks the sh <dig> domain  <cit> . a p67phox homolog nox-regulator  was also reported in some fungi including ascomycetes and higher basidiomycetes  <cit> . the basic motif structure of noxr is similar to that of d. discoideum. a noxr-deficient mutant of the ascomycete epichlöe festucae shows decreased ros-generation  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that noxr regulates noxa and/or noxb in the slime mold and fungi, although this has not been tested directly.

herein, we assembled and analyzed experimentally cloned and computationally predicted amino acid sequences of the phox-related regulatory subunits p47phox, noxo <dig>  p67phox, noxa <dig>  p40phox, p22phox, and noxr from  <dig> vertebrates, one urochordate, one echinoderm, one mollusc, one cnidarian, one choanoflagellate,  <dig> fungi, and one slime mold amoeba. using this large set of amino acid sequences, we report:  the occurrence and origin of phox-like subunits during evolution,  identification of putative key amino acid residues conserved in regulatory subunits,  the description of putative new modular regions that are conserved among phox-related regulatory subunits,  the molecular evolution of characteristic domains of the phox-related regulatory subunits, and  a prediction of novel fungal and amoebal nox organizer/enhancer subunits based on sequence analysis.

RESULTS
occurrence of phox-related regulatory subunits
the earlier chordate ciona intestinalis  possesses a nox <dig> ortholog, but not nox <dig> or nox <dig>  <cit> . the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus  belongs to echinodermata, which diverged early from an ancestor common to urochordates and vertebrates  <cit> . s. purpuratus, possesses two nox <dig> genes, nox2a and nox2b, and an analysis of the taxonomy noxes demonstrates that these nox <dig> genes are related to the common ancestor gene of vertebrate nox <dig>  nox <dig> and nox <dig>  <cit> . c. intestinalis possesses single copies of p47phox-, p67phox-, and p22phox-like genes  <cit> , which presumably regulate its nox <dig> ortholog . the s. purpuratus genome possesses single copies of p47phox- and p67phox-like genes . no p22phox ortholog of s. purpuratus was identified using a blast search of recently published genome sequences  <cit> . because the s. purpuratus p47phox-like protein has a highly conserved tandem sh <dig> region that in other species binds to the c-terminal proline-rich region  of p22phox, it seems likely that s. purpuratus has an as-yet unidentified p22phox homologue.

using the estimated time of evolution of deuterostomes based on hox gene clusters to construct a phylogenetic tree  <cit> , we illustrate the occurrence during evolution of the phox-related regulatory subunits. the phylogenic tree suggests an evolutionary model in which duplication of both the p47phox gene and the p67phox gene occurred at a time corresponding to the appearance of vertebrates, with the noxo <dig> and noxa <dig> genes subsequently evolving as distinct regulatory subunits in vertebrates . this appearance of noxo <dig> and noxa <dig> coincided with the emergence of nox <dig>  <cit> . the pufferfish t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis are considered to have evolved from an o. latipes ancestor approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this tree suggests that noxa <dig> and noxo <dig> of t. rubripes and noxa <dig> of t. nigroviridis have been lost during the decrease in genome sizes in these species . in contrast to the co-appearance of p47phox and p67phox orthologs with the earliest nox <dig> ortholog in s. purpuratus, p40phox appeared later, in vertebrates, and was not found in the genomes of either c. intestinalis or s. purpuratus . the situation of the regulatory subunits of other primitive animals and a choanoflagellate is described below.

a homologue of p67phox/noxa <dig> occurs in the slime mold amoeba   <cit>  . fungal genomes of aspergillus nidulans , magnaporthe grisea , and fusarium graminearum , all members of ascomycota, also possess noxr, a homolog of p67phox  <cit>  . however, saccharomyces cerevisiae  that also belongs to ascomycota does not possess any nox or noxr orthologs  <cit>  . some basidiomycetes  also possess noxr and noxa/b genes . the situation of the regulatory subunits of other fungi is described below. interestingly, the fungi seem to lack precise homologues of p47phox/noxo <dig> or its binding partner p22phox . recently, the possibility of p22phox-like gene in the d. discoideum genome was suggested  <cit> , but it is not clear whether the gene represents an ancestral p22phox, a later adaptation or a functionally unrelated protein. we discuss the possibilities below based on a comparison of the amino acid sequences of amoebal p22phox and other p22phox orthologs. in addition, we identified other predicted proteins encoded in fungal and amoebal genomes that may function as  binding partner of the nox activator proteins , suggesting the early evolutionary origin not only of the activator protein, but also possibly of a rudimentary organizer subunit.

synteny of noxo <dig> ad noxa <dig> genes in vertebrates
an extensive blast search has failed to identify the noxa <dig> gene in the pufferfish t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis genomes, as indicated in figure  <dig>  in addition to the absence of noxa <dig>  t. rubripes seems to have lost the noxo <dig> gene. to substantiate that the noxo <dig> and noxa <dig> genes were indeed absent, we compared chromosomal synteny  of noxo <dig> in vertebrates. the human noxo <dig> gene is preceded by syngr <dig> and gfer genes on chromosome  <dig> , and followed by tbl <dig>  rps <dig> and rpl3l. synteny was preserved in mammals and the chicken g. gallus. the frog x. tropicalis lacks syngr <dig>  but other markers are preserved. among fish, t. nigroviridis conserved part of the mammalian synteny: noxo <dig>  tbl <dig>  rps <dig>  and rpl3l and instead of syngr <dig> and gfer, c17orf <dig> is positioned next to noxo <dig>  synteny of the t. rubripes genome was very similar to that of t. nigroviridis, although it lacks a noxo <dig> ortholog . two fishes, d. rerio and o. latipes, genomes possess noxo <dig> genes, but with greater variations in synteny;although tbl <dig> and c17orf <dig> were present in the same chromosome as noxo <dig>  other linked markers were not seen . the gene markers c17orf <dig> and tbl <dig> of o. latipes are present on a separate chromosome from that of noxo <dig>  thus, the synteny analysis of the t. rubripes genomes shows that the noxo <dig> gene was indeed lost during evolution.

the synteny of genetic markers surrounding noxa <dig> was highly conserved in h. sapiens, c. familliaris, m. musculus, g. gallus . both noxa <dig> and the linked markers of r. norvegicus were present in chromosome  <dig>  with a long insert between noxa1and entpd <dig> . in the genome of x. tropicalis, synteny was more varied in that noxa <dig> and entpd <dig> were present in the same scaffold, but other markers were not seen. synteny of fish noxa <dig> was preserved among the class but different from other vertebrates. o. latipes and d. rerio noxa <dig> genes are preceded by man1b <dig> and dpp <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . t. nigroviridis possesses two markers man1b <dig> and dpp <dig>  but lacks the noxa <dig> ortholog. synteny of t. rubripes is similar to that of d. rerio, but a noxa <dig> ortholog is absent. thus, the synteny of noxa <dig> had considerable variation, and this analysis indicates that noxa <dig> orthologs were lost during the evolution of the two pufferfish genomes.

identification of putative critical amino acids conserved among p47phox/noxo <dig> orthologs
the px domain of p47phox binds with highest affinity to phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate , and with lower but significant affinity to ptdinsp <dig>  ptdinsp <dig> and ptdinsp  <cit> . the px domain of human noxo <dig> shows a different lipid binding specificity, with highest affinity for ptdinsp <dig>  ptdinsp, and ptdinsp and lower affinity for ptdinsp and ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . both px and bis-sh <dig> domains are seen in all p47phox/noxo <dig> orthologs of deuterostomes . comparison of the sequences of the organizer proteins allowed identification of amino acid residues that are highly conserved . eleven highly conserved residues were identified in the px domain, and  <dig> in the bis-sh <dig> domains . arg- <dig>  pro- <dig>  and arg- <dig> of the px-domain and trp- <dig>  phe- <dig>  and trp- <dig> of the bis-sh <dig> domain  were previously shown by mutational analyses to be essential for the activation of human nox <dig> by p47phox  <cit> .

while the px and bis-sh <dig> domains are shared among all p47phox and noxo <dig> orthologs including those of s. purpuratus and c. intestinalis, the molecular taxonomy of the regions  reveals that vertebrate p47phox and noxo <dig> families form distinct subgroups , likely accounting, for example, for differences in lipid binding specificities  <cit> . the phylogenic tree supports an evolutionary model in which the p47phox-like proteins of s. purpuratus and c. intestinalis  branch from a root that is closely related to the primordial ancestors of both p47phox  and noxo <dig> .

to maintain p47phox strictly in an inactive state that cannot bind to p22phox, human p47phox masks its bis-sh <dig> domain with the air region  <cit> , and this region is absent in human noxo <dig>  <cit> . therefore nox <dig> activity is considered more tightly controlled than nox <dig> activity. most residues essential for the function of the air , are well conserved among all vertebrate p47phox proteins . interestingly c. intestinalis and s. purpuratus p47phox proteins possessed the air-like region . s. purpuratus possesses two nox2-like proteins nox2a and 2b that are co-orthologs of vertebrate noxes 1–3; the presence of a p47phox ortholog harboring the air suggests that this primitive nox system functions analogously to the mammalian nox <dig> system. all noxo <dig> orthologs lack the air, with one exception, the teleost fish o. latipes, which retains the predicted air in both the p47phox and the noxo <dig> genes . thus, this analysis supports an evolutionary model in which the noxo <dig> "air-independent" nox <dig> and nox <dig> activation systems originated from the p47phox-like "air-dependent" nox <dig> regulatory system. the o. latipes noxo <dig>  which contains the air, represents an evolutionary remnant reflecting the transition from air-dependence to -independence.

the heterodimerization of human p47phox and p67phox is dependent on the interaction between the c-terminal prr of p47phox and the c-terminal sh <dig> domain of p67phox  <cit> . both of these regions were conserved in vertebrate p47phox and p67phox orthologs, but not in orthologs of lower organisms . the alignment of vertebrate p47phox and noxo <dig> amino acid sequences demonstrates that in addition to the prr, the c-terminal region immediately following the prr  was also highly conserved. the prr of p47phox isologs possesses four strictly conserved residues , and the c-tail region had an additional four identical amino acids  . consistent with these identities, the essential binding roles of three residues  were previously demonstrated by mutational analyses  <cit> . the c-tail region is thought to enhance the interaction between the prr of p47phox and the sh <dig> domain of p67phox  <cit> , since simultaneous mutation of six of these residues  significantly decreased the binding of the p47phox prr to the p67phox sh <dig> domain  <cit> . four of these residues  are highly conserved among both p47phox and noxo <dig> proteins, but two other residues  were conserved only in p47phox orthologs . this suggests that the binding affinities of p47phox and noxo <dig> toward their respective activator protein sh <dig> domains may differ due to differences in these residues. ser- <dig> in the c-tail region of human p47phox is a phosphorylation site  <cit> ; the phosphorylation of which negatively regulates binding of the prr and c-tail regions to the p67phox sh <dig> domain  <cit> . the threonine or serine residue is conserved at the position in all vertebrate p47phox and g. gallus, d. rerio and o. latipes noxo <dig> , indicating that noxo <dig> proteins of these species retain this feature of p47phox which is subsequently lost in higher vertebrate noxo <dig> 

t. rubripes c17orf <dig> ortholog as a candidate noxo1-like protein
the noxo <dig> gene seems to have been lost from the t. rubripes genome, as shown in figure 2a. on the other hand, orthologs of chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig>  gene predicted by the ensembl transcript model  <cit>  are present adjacent to the noxo <dig> genes in the d. rerio and t. nigroviridis genomes . amino acid sequences of these c17orf <dig> orthologs showed conserved prr and polybasic regions . in addition to the prr and polybasic region, the t. rubripes c17orf <dig> ortholog has an extended region that encodes domains analogous to the c-terminal regions of noxo1; these contain the bis-sh <dig> domain, prr and c-tail region . the sequence of t. rubripes c17orf <dig> possesses the  <dig> residues that are conserved in bis-sh <dig> domains of p47phox and noxo <dig>  and the eight key residues conserved in the prr and c-tail regions . a phosphorylation site corresponding to ser- <dig> residue of human p47phox is also conserved in the t. rubripes c17orf <dig> . although the function of c17orf <dig> has not been established in any species, its noxo1-like domain structure suggests that the c17orf <dig> ortholog of t. rubripes may function in place of the authentic noxo <dig> 

identification of putative critical amino acids conserved among p67phox/noxa <dig> orthologs
alignment of the amino acid sequences of the  <dig> nox-activator proteins  identified  <dig> conserved amino acids in the tpr domains . this includes two residues that have been identified as essential for binding human p67phox to rac, as determined by the crystal structure of the complex  <cit>  . the ad was first identified by mutagenesis of p67phox  <cit> . val- <dig> of human p67phox and the corresponding residue val- <dig> of human noxa <dig> are crucial for respective activation of nox <dig> and nox <dig>  <cit> . all orthologs of p67phox and noxa <dig>  and one fungal noxr  conserve this valine residue . the two fungal noxr  retained the hydrophobic amino acid leucine instead of valine at this position . similarly, the second ad-like region of s. purpuratus p67phox-like protein  conserved an isoleucine residue at this position. in contrast, dd-p67-like protein lacked a typical ad sequence . the n-terminal region containing the tpr and ad can be considered as the "nox-activating region", a module that cooperates with rac to activate nox enzymatic activity  <cit> . taxonomy of the "nox-activating region"  reveals distinct subgroups corresponding to noxa <dig> and to p67phox, and shows that the noxr proteins of fungi also represent a distinct subgroup . a fourth rather diverse subgroup is comprised of p67phox-like proteins that include those of s. purpuratus and c. intestinalis . taken together with the taxonomy of p47phox  and of noxes  <cit> , these data support an evolutionary model in which duplication of both the p67phox and p47phox genes occurred in vertebrates at a time corresponding to the appearance of nox <dig>  in contrast to fungal noxr, dd-p67-like protein appeared to branch from a root shared with sea urchin-p67phox-like genes ; however, the bootstrap value was only 35% raising uncertainty as to which subgroup the amoebal p67-like protein belongs. nevertheless, amoebal p67-like protein is clearly distinct from the noxr group.

in contrast to the c-terminal sh <dig> domain  of activator proteins which is seen in all vertebrate activator proteins, the central sh <dig> domain  was seen only in vertebrate p67phox . comparison of sequences of all vertebrate p67phox orthologs identified  <dig> highly conserved amino acids in this sh <dig> domain . in addition, a region between ad and sh3-a  was strictly conserved among vertebrate p67phox isologs, but was not seen in others, such as noxa <dig> and noxr. a consensus sequence was identified in this region . a prr-like region  was seen in adsis region, but it does not conserve in all vertebrate p67phox isologs based on the deduced sequences . the role of the putative region is currently unknown, but may involve a function related to sh3-a because it coincides with the presence of sh3-a. despite the high conservation of sh3-a among vertebrate p67phox orthologs, the role of this domain is not defined  <cit> .

the pb <dig> domain was present in all vertebrate p67phox, in vertebrate noxa <dig> and in fungal noxr and amoebal p67-like protein, but not in c. intestinalis and s. purpuratus p67phox-like proteins . the crystal structure of the heterodimer between the pb <dig> domains of p67phox and p40phox domain demonstrated that lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> in human p67phox are essential to bind the pb <dig> domain of p40phox  <cit> . residues corresponding to lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> of human p67phox are conserved not only in the vertebrate p67phox, but also in the noxa <dig> orthologs of chicken  and fish  . this suggests that in addition to its well-described role in activating nox <dig>  p40phox probably also participates in activating nox <dig> in chicken and fish . on the other hand, noxa <dig> of x. tropicalis has lost both of these p40phox-interacting residues. thus, these data support an evolutionary model in which p40phox originally participated in regulating both nox <dig> and nox <dig> in vertebrates, but after the appearance of mammals, nox <dig>  became independent of p40phox. the lack of a pb <dig> domain in both c. intestinalis and s. purpuratus p67phox-like proteins is consistent with the absence of p40phox orthologs in these species .

the analysis of pb <dig> domain sequences in nox activators also suggests an unexpected relationship between the ad and the pb <dig> domain. ad regions of all vertebrate p67phox contain a positively charged residue, e.g., lys- <dig> of h-p67phox . this basic residue is also completely conserved in noxa <dig> orthologs of g. gallus, d. rerio and o. latipes , which retain functional pb <dig> domains , but not in the other noxa <dig> and p67phox-like proteins  . interestingly, the fungal noxr, which possess these key basic residues in their pb <dig> domains , also conserves this basic residue in their ad regions . thus, the presence of a functional pb <dig> domain correlates strongly with the presence of a positively charged residue corresponding to position  <dig> in the human p67phox sequence, and may point to the functional cooperation of these two regions, e.g. in binding to p40phox or other functionally analogous proteins in fungi . alternatively, the positively charged residue in ad region might be related to the tail-to-tail interaction between vertebrate p47phox and p67phox  because a sequence analysis of nox organizers that is shown in figure 3d suggests that the conserved residue also co-occurs with the phosphorylation site in the c-tail region of all vertebrate p47phox and early vertebrate noxo <dig>  thus, co-appearance and co-disappearance of evolutionarily conserved residue provides a hint to find an unknown relationship between regulatory-subunits.

sh3-b was seen in all vertebrate p67phox and noxa <dig> orthologs and in s. purpuratus p67phox-like protein . among these orthologs, seven conserved amino acid residues in sh3-b were identified , and the residues include a tryptophan  that was previously shown to be crucial for interaction with the c-terminal prr of nox organizer proteins  <cit> .

identification of putative critical amino acids conserved among p40phox orthologs
mammalian p40phox is considered to be an enhancer of nox <dig> activation  <cit> . p40phox orthologs emerged in vertebrates  coincident with the appearance of the pb <dig> domain of p67phox-like proteins. fungal noxr and amoebal p67-like proteins also possess the pb <dig> domains , but their genomes do not encode a distinct p40phox ortholog. the protein sequences of vertebrate p40phox orthologs are highly conserved; the canonical px, sh <dig>  and pb <dig> domains are all seen among vertebrate p40phox orthologs . alignment of ten vertebrate p40phox orthologs showed  <dig> conserved amino acid residues in the px domain , including phe- <dig>  arg- <dig>  tyr- <dig>  leu- <dig>  arg- <dig>  that have been demonstrated to be essential for phospholipid-binding  <cit> . phylogenic analysis using the trimmed px domain sequences  does not reveal obvious sub-families. recently a novel intramolecular interaction in p40phox between the px and pb <dig> domains was reported  <cit> . the interface between the px and pb <dig> domains consists of a hydrophobic pocket by phe- <dig> of the px domain and val- <dig>  pro- <dig>  leu- <dig> and phe- <dig> of the pb <dig> domain and ionic interactions between his- <dig>  arg- <dig>  and arg- <dig> of the px domain and glu- <dig> and asp- <dig> of the pb <dig> domain   <cit> . the residue corresponding to the leu- <dig> is much varied among vertebrate p40phox proteins , suggesting that the residue is less crucial than that previously proposed if the interaction is important in other vertebrates than human. the residue to his- <dig> is often replaced by tyrosine. the majority of other residues are conserved, but there are some exceptions: residues corresponding to arg- <dig> in x. tropicalis p40phox and to glu- <dig> and asp- <dig> in rat p40phox .

to the best of our knowledge, a role for the sh <dig> domain of p40phox has not been defined  <cit> . eighteen amino acids are conserved in the sh <dig> domain . between the px and sh <dig> domains, we identified a new conserved region of  <dig> amino acids that is rich in proline, arginine and lysine, and is therefore designated the "proline-basic  domain" . this putative region is not essential for ptdinsp-binding by the p40phox px domain  <cit> . an intramolecular interaction between the px and pb <dig> domains seem not to be related to p-basic region according to the structure of full length p40phox  <cit> . the structural analysis demonstrates that p-basic region forms a separate motif and is situated closely to the px domain  <cit> , indicating that it might support the cell membrane-binding function of p40phox together with the px-domain. alternatively, the p-basic region might interact with the sh <dig> domain of p40phox in a manner similar to the interaction between the air and the tandem sh <dig> of human p47phox. interestingly, thr- <dig> of human p40phox, located in the center of p-basic region, has been identified as a phosphorylation site  <cit> , and this residue is entirely conserved among all vertebrate p40phox orthologs .

the pb <dig> domain of human p40phox harbors acidic amino acids forming the "opca  motif". an opca motif contains four distinctive acidic residues that are essential for binding to conserved basic residues in the p67phox pb <dig> domain  <cit> . the four acidic residues, asp- <dig>  glu- <dig>  asp- <dig> and asp- <dig>  are conserved in all orthologs with the exception of a glutamine rather than a glutamic acid in the position of c. familliaris p40phox that corresponds to glu- <dig> of human p40phox .

identification of putative critical amino acids conserved among p22phox orthologs
human p22phox contains two predicted transmembrane regions  <cit>  and forms a stabilizing heterocomplex with nox <dig> as well as nox <dig>  nox <dig>  and nox <dig>  <cit> . the prr of p22phox is the only motif in this protein whose role in nox activation has been demonstrated  <cit> . the prr is highly conserved among all p22phox orthologs , consistent with its role as a docking site for the bis-sh <dig> domain of organizer proteins. in addition, a total of  <dig> amino acids were identical in all p22phox sequences , suggesting important additional functions, particularly for the n-terminal regions preceding tm <dig>  within these conserved residues, we identified a region rich in arginine and lysine , and is therefore designated the polybasic region . a short sequence containing multiple basic amino acid residues has been proposed to contribute to recruitment of proteins to membrane sub-regions and to function in receptor-internalization via interaction with phospholipids  <cit> . according to our preliminary data, mutation in the polybasic region of p22phox did not affect extracellular ros production from nox2-transfected human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells . this implies that the putative conserved region might function in a role unrelated to the enzymatic activity of nox <dig>  e.g. in phagocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis.

as shown in figure  <dig>  a p22phox-like protein was not identified in s. purpuratus, but because the genome sequence of this organism is incomplete and because a p47phox-like protein with a conserved bis-sh <dig> domain is present, we suggest that this organism probably possesses an undiscovered p22phox-like protein, or a protein that serves an analogous function. our analysis did not provide convincing evidence for a p22phox isolog in slime mold amoeba. lardy et al. argued that this organism may possess a membrane-associated p22phox-like protein ; predicted p22phox-like gene-null d. discoideum mutant is unable to produce spores, similar to nox-null mutants  <cit> . however according to our analysis, this protein is highly divergent in amino acid sequence compared with the consensus sequence obtained from all other organisms, showing disagreement in  <dig> out of the  <dig> conserved residues shown in figure 7a. thus, further investigation is needed to judge whether the gene emerged as a later adaptation or whether it represents a primitive p22phox gene.

molecular evolution of domains of nox organizers and activators in deuterostomia
as described above, comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the nox regulatory subunit orthologs revealed certain features of the evolution of characteristic domains. some key residues and domains are summarized in figure  <dig>  which shows the proposed evolution of organizer and activator proteins. the p47phox orthologs of all vertebrates  have identical domain structures, which include the px domain, bis-sh <dig> domain, air, and prr. on the other hand, the domain composition of noxo <dig>  changed during the evolution from fish to tetrapods: the noxo <dig> orthologs of tetrapods and fish all possessed the px domain, bis-sh <dig> domain, and prr. however, the predicted air  is also present in o. latipes but is absent in d. rerio and tetrapods . despite the presence of the air in o. latipes noxo <dig>  it is clearly distinguished by sequence homology and synteny from a p47phox isolog, as shown in figure 3b. thus, initially, following gene duplication from p47phox, noxo <dig> retained the air regulatory feature of p47phox, and this feature was subsequently lost.

like vertebrate isologs of p47phox, the p47phox-like proteins of c. intestinalis and s. purpuratus possess the px domain, bis-sh <dig> domain, and air. however, these isologs differ considerably in the c-terminal regions that, in higher forms, interact with p67phox isologs. the c-terminus of the c. intestinalis p47phox lacks the prr, but motif scanning by prosite  <cit>  demonstrates the p47phox-like protein contains, instead, additional sh <dig> domain . the s. purpuratus p47phox-like protein also lacked the c-terminal prr, but instead had two additional sh <dig> domains  separated by two prrs  .

all vertebrate orthologs of p67phox have the same domains seen in human p67phox . importantly, all p67phox and noxa <dig> proteins possess the ad region, which has been shown to be critical for activating superoxide generation in nox <dig> and nox <dig>  <cit> . the tpr motif is present in all species, and the two critical residues for rac-binding, asp- <dig> and arg- <dig> of human p67phox  <cit> , are conserved among all vertebrate isologs of p67phox and noxa <dig> , supporting the idea that binding to rac is a conserved feature of vertebrate p67phox andnoxa <dig>  the n-terminal domain structures of c. intestinalis and s. purpuratus p67phox-like proteins are similar to those of vertebrate p67phox and noxa <dig> . both p67phox-like proteins possess a tpr domain retaining the two critical rac-binding residues . in addition, s. purpuratus p67phox-like protein possesses a second set of tpr and ad-like domains. both trp domains retain conserved essential rac-binding residues, but the second ad-like domain was not well conserved as shown in figure 5c. thus, rac binding is likely to be an evolutionarily conserved feature among all p67phox/noxa <dig> proteins.

in mammals, binding between the pb <dig> domains of p67phox and p40phox has been shown to mediate heterodimer formation. the crystal structure of the heterodimer of the pb <dig> domains from p67phox and p40phox  <cit>  demonstrated that lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> in human p67phox are essential to bind to the pb <dig> domain of p40phox, and mutation of lys- <dig> of human p67phox abolished binding to p40phox  <cit> . these crucial residues are entirely conserved in the pb <dig> domains of all vertebrate p67phox proteins, which imply that they all bind to p40phox . in contrast to vertebrate p67phox, mammalian noxa <dig> does not retain these two key amino acids , explaining the failure of noxa <dig> to bind to p40phox  <cit> . however, the chicken g. gallus, and the fish d. rerio and o. latipes noxa <dig> completely conserve these two residues, and an opca motif of p40phox , which is essential for binding to the p67phox pb <dig> domain are highly conserved. the conservations of key residues suggest that in these fish, binding to p40phox may be retained . thus, the loss of function of p40phox can be traced in the evolution of noxa <dig>  both c. intestinalis and s. purpuratus p67phox-like proteins lack a pb <dig> domain, consistent with the absence of p40phox orthologs.

the px-domain of human p40phox specifically binds to ptdinsp  <cit> . therefore, p40phox accumulates during phagocytosis at early endosomes, which are rich in ptdinsp  <cit> . t. rubripes p40phox is expressed in a wide range of tissues including the gastrointestinal tissues  <cit> , while nox <dig> expression is restricted to the blood and kidney. although nox <dig> expression in fish or the other non-mammal organisms is not clear, our analysis suggest that nox <dig> of fish and birds might function, along with the p40phox orthologs, in endocytosis, e.g., in receptor-internalization. this novel relationship between nox <dig> and p40phox may provide a clue to understanding the physiological role of nox <dig> in vertebrates.

the vertebrate p67phox and noxa <dig> orthologs all have the c-terminal sh <dig> domain that, in human, mediates binding to the prr of p47phox and noxo <dig>  respectively. this supports the idea that all of the vertebrate forms of these proteins mediate protein interactions via tail-to-tail binding between the sh <dig> domain of the activator protein and the prr of the organizer protein. we further suggest that even though the structures of the c-termini of p47phox- and p67phox-like proteins in c. intestinalis and in s. purpuratus differ from the vertebrate proteins, the same sort of tail-to-tail binding of these p67phox-like proteins to the corresponding p47phox-like proteins occurs as diagrammed at the bottom of figure  <dig>  for example, we suggest that the c-terminal putative prrs of c. intestinalis p67phox-like proteins  binds to the c-terminal sh <dig> domain of the p47phox-like protein as indicated by a broken line in figure  <dig>  reversing the mode of interaction seen in the vertebrate proteins but accomplishing the same function. similarly, sh <dig> domains and putative prrs in the c-terminus of s. purpuratus p47phox-like protein may interact with the prrs and the sh <dig> domains in the c-terminus of s. purpuratus p67phox, respectively. thus, while domains in the c-termini of p47phox and p67phox orthologs are not conserved during evolution, the model shown in figure  <dig> suggests that the "docking function" has been retained. the model suggests three functional modules within the organizer protein/activator protein complex: 1), a "membrane-binding/cytochrome docking region" on the organizer protein that is comprised of the phospholipids-binding px domain and the tandem sh <dig> region that binds to the prr of p22phox; 2) a "nox-activating region" that contains the rac-binding tpr domain and the ad, which together cooperate to stimulate the activity of the nox catalytic domain; and 3) a "regulator-docking region" which uses evolutionarily variable but paired docking modules that link the "membrane-binding/cytochrome docking region" of p47phox to the "nox-activating region" of p67phox .

occurrence and origin of phox-like regulatory subunits during evolution of metazoa and choanoflagellata
in addition to regulatory subunit-dependent nox proteins of the deuterostomia, we assembled predicted regulatory subunits and the subunit-regulated nox isolog sequences present in the genomes of following species: the sea anemone nematostella vectensis , the limpet lottia gigantea , the marine choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis  . according to the recent phylogeny based on small ribosomal subunit gene and other molecular tools  <cit> , the bilaterian animals consist of three clades: deuterostomia, lophotrochozoa, and ecdysozoa. a gastropod snail, the limpet l. gigantea, belongs to the lophotrochozoa, and p67phox, p47phox, p22phox-like genes are found in this genome . the predicted motif structures by the pfam program are shown in figure 9b; characteristic motifs of p67phox  and p47phox  as well as the key residues  are conserved. the genome of l. gigantea also possesses an ancestral nox <dig> gene as a co-ortholog of vertebrate nox1- <dig>  like nox <dig> isologs in primitive deuterostomes  <cit> . on the other hand, any distinct regulatory subunit genes were not found in seven species that belongs to ecdysozoa including two nemotodes , four insects , and one non-insect arthropod  .

before the emergence of bilateral animals, cnidarians split from the main animal lineage and the genome retained many of the features present in last common ancestor of animals  <cit> . the starlet sea anemone n. vectensis that belongs to the cnidaria, conserves p47phox-, p22phox-like genes, and two ancestral nox <dig> genes, nox2a and 2b . the characteristic motifs of the putative regulatory subunits are predicted by the pfam program and shown in figure 9b . n. vectensis p47phox possesses px and bis-sh <dig> domains. the isolog also possesses a putative polybasic region within the sequence corresponding to the air of the human p47phox gene. a polybasic region is a class iii consensus motif for binding to a sh <dig> domain  <cit> ; therefore, this may implicate the polybasic region as a prototype of the air. although the current version of the n. vectensis genome does not encode an obvious p67phox-like gene, the presence of multiple sh <dig> domains in n. vectensis p47phox points to an unidentified p67phox ortholog or an unknown prr-containing binding partner. although cnidarians have no specialized immune cells, the n. vectensis genome possesses orthologous genes to toll/toll-like receptors, complement c3-like molecules, and a redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-κb that are orthologs of key components of innate immunity in vertebrates  <cit> . further study needs to identify an original role of phox-type nadph oxidase in the primitive multicellular animals.

one clear implication of these genomic and detailed sequence analyses described above is that the hypothetical ancestor of primitive animals might conserve the phox-type nadph-oxidase system. in the middle of the nineteenth century, a striking structural resemblance between the collar cells, so-called "choanocytes", of primitive animal sponges and a group of protists the choanoflagellates has been noted . a line of recent phylogenic analyses suggests that the metazoa including sponges, cnidarians, and other animals constitutes a monophyletic clade closely related to the choanoflagellata  <cit> ; therefore, the choanoflagellates are considered to be the organisms that are close in evolution to the all modern animals. the unicellular marine choanoflagellate m. brevicollis has been reported as a closer relatives to the hypothetical ancestor of all multicellular animals based on the comparative analyses of animal-specific genes  <cit> . interestingly, the genome of m. brevicollis possesses p47phox- and p22phox-like genes , but a blast searching in the current m. brevicollis genomic database failed to identify a dinstinct p67phox ortholog. furthermore, nox2-like gene is present in the m. brevicollis genome sequence . interestingly, a taxonomy of nox domains demonstrates that m. brevicollis nox2-like gene diverges from the monophyletic clade of all metazoan nox <dig> genes containing other ancestral nox <dig> and all vertebrate nox1- <dig>  but it differs from nox <dig> and fungal noxa/noxb subfamilies . the m. brevicollis p47phox-like protein possesses air-like region that conserves a serine residue consistent with a consensus motif of a putative substrate of protein kinase c ; therefore, this implies that ros-generating activity of the most primitive nox2-like protein is also strictly regulated by phosphorylation as seen in mammalian phagocyte nadph-oxidase. the physiological function of the primordial nox <dig> enzyme in m. brevicollis is unknown, but the early appearance of the phox-like nox system in the unicellular flagellate suggests the presence of a fundamental and essential role of the regulatory subunit-dependent nox in a unicellular living.

sh3pxd <dig> as a p47phox family member
as shown in figure  <dig>  a choanoflagellate and primitive animals possess p47phox-like genes as well as ancestral nox <dig> and prr-containing p22phox genes. on the other hand, further blastp search in the animal genomes using the m. brevicolli p47phox-like protein sequence suggested the presence of a protein family proteins related to the primitive p47phox in higher animals, encoding the "sh <dig> and px domains 2" protein  . the encoded protein is composed of an n-terminal px domain and a central bis-sh <dig> domain, plus two or three additional sh <dig> domains in the c-terminal half of the molecule . the sh3pxd <dig> gene is present in a urochordate, but was not seen in an echinoderm and other primitive metazoan species . in vertebrates, two isozymes sh3pxd2a and 2b were found . interestingly the m. brevicollis p47phox-like gene and other primitive animal p47phox-like genes are related more closely to the sh3pxd <dig> gene subfamily than to the vertebrate p47phox and noxo <dig> subfamilies . the physiological function of sh3pxd2a is suggested by only a few papers; human sh3pxd2a protein  is involved in the protease-driven invasion of cancer cells and the neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-beta  <cit> . a protein binding to sh3pxd2a is also little known, but recently n-wasp  was proposed as a candidate that binds to the third sh <dig> domain of the human sh3pxd2a  <cit> . the physiological role as well as the binding partner of sh3pxd2b is unknown. however, the clear phylogenetic relationship of the sh3pxd <dig> gene family to the larger family of nox-regulatory organizing proteins suggests that the genes might be involved in regulating nox activity. alternatively, sh3pxd <dig> proteins may have diverged to perform unrelated functions . thus, the m. brevilcollis p47phox-like protein evolved from a hypothetical p47phox ancestor, and the sh3pxd <dig> genes diverged from the lineage of the p47phox-like gene following the emergence of chordates but prior to noxo <dig> . the vertebrate p47phox and noxo <dig> were somehow able to eliminate the additional sh <dig> domains in the "regulator-docking region", as proposed in figure  <dig> 

what is the regulatory subunit binding partner for fungal noxr?
fungi  belong to ascomycota  <cit>  and possess the noxr gene as a p67phox ortholog . noxr encodes a pb <dig> domain homologous to that in p67phox, but these organisms do not possess a p40phox ortholog . as shown in figure 5e, two important basic residues in the pb <dig> domains are conserved in all noxr proteins. the conservation of these residues implies the existence of an unknown noxr binding partner containing a pb <dig> domain with an opca motif . a blast search of a database of computationally predicted amino acid sequences  <cit>  from the genomes of a. nidulans, m. grisea, and f. graminearum was performed using as a query sequence the pb <dig> domain of human p40phox . in addition to noxr, three sequences harboring pb <dig> domains were identified in the fungi. these were: "sh3-sh3-px-srr-pb1", "cdc24-rhogef-pb1" and "n-pb1" proteins , so-named for their domain structures in sequence from n- to c-termini. srr indicates a serine-rich region. the three predicted proteins were encoded in all three fungal genomes, and all three possessed acidic opca motifs in their pb <dig> domains .

the "sh3-sh3-px-srr-pb1" protein contains a similar domain structure to yeast s. cerevisiae bem1p , but differs in that the pb <dig> domain of s. cerevisiae bem1p does not contain the opca motif  <cit> . a speculative model for the regulation of fungal nox by the bem <dig> ortholog is shown in figure 11d, wherein bem <dig> ortholog is proposed to play a role as an organizer protein, analogous to the roles of p47phox and p40phox in mammals. according to this model, pb1-pb <dig> interaction mediates the linkage between the "regulator-docking regions" suggested in figure  <dig>  px-domain of the s. cerevisiae bem <dig> facilitates a protein to anchor to a membrane lipid layer  <cit> . fungi do not have a prr-containing p22phox ortholog , but noxa and noxb in the three fungi has a distinctive highly conserved a class ii prr motif  <cit>   and class iii  near the predicted nadph-binding sub-regions  <cit> . thus the hypothetical functions of the bis-sh <dig> and px domains indicate the analogous function as a "membrane-binding/cytochrome docking region" of nox organizer. because s. cerevisiae bem <dig> is involved in establishment of cell polarity  <cit> , the proposed interaction between fungal noxr and bem <dig> orthologs may point to a function of nox-derived ros in cell polarity.

a second model is suggested by the "cdc24-rhogef-pb1" protein, which is an ortholog of s. cerevisiae cdc24p . according to this "exchanger model", the pb1-mediated heterodimer formation localizes the rhogef domain which then catalyzes the conversion of rac-gdp to the active rac-gtp . the model is supported by a recent report showed that fungal noxr binds to the fungal rac homologue in the gtp form  <cit> .

an "energy sensor" function for noxr is shown in figure 11f, and is based on the occurrence of the cbs  domain in the putative binding partner. the cbs domain senses cellular energy status by binding adenosine nucleotides; it occurs in a range of proteins including amp-activated protein kinase, which is activated by amp and inhibited by atp via the cbs domain  <cit> . such a function might be related to the requirement of nox enzyme for reduced pyridine nucleotide, thus affecting cellular energetics.

fungal nox and noxr isologs are seen not only in fungi belonging to ascomycota, but also some basidiomycetes  <cit> . to explore the likelihood of the fungal nox activation mechanisms suggested in figure  <dig>  the occurrence of noxr, bem <dig>  cdc <dig>  and cbsn-pb <dig> isologs were compared in  <dig> fungal genomes spanning the four fungal divisions: ascomycota, basidiomycota, zygomycota, and chytridiomycota . bem <dig>  cdc <dig>  and cbsn-pb <dig> genes are present in most of the fungal genomes, with the exception of cdc <dig> in batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , and these proteins all conserved the pb <dig> domains with some exceptions; y. lipolytica noxr and coprinopsis cinerea cdc <dig> isologs lack the pb <dig> domain . in addition to the absence of nox and noxr isolog genes in s. cerevisiae, the nox and noxr isologs are absent in the genomes of candida albicans, yarrowia lipolytica  and schizosaccharomyces pombe   <cit> . a nox gene is absent in the genomes of y. lipolytica and phycomyces blakesleeanus  despite the presence of noxr isologs  <cit> . the p. blakesleeanus genome possesses two bem <dig> and cbs-pb <dig> genes and all conserved the pb <dig> domains. we investigated the conservation of two basic residues of the pb <dig> domain corresponding to the lys- <dig> and - <dig> residues of human p67phox and the four acidic residues in opca motif corresponding to the asp- <dig>  glu- <dig>  and asp- <dig>  - <dig> residues of human p40phox. comparison of the pb <dig> domains in these fungal proteins by alignment and analyses by the pfam program demonstrate that the two basic and four acidic residues are conserved in the fungal noxr, bem <dig>  cdc <dig>  and cbsn-pb <dig> with a few exceptions; the opca motifs in bem <dig> isologs of s. cerevisiae and c. albicans has been lost . the high conservation of the motif strongly implies that these pb <dig> domains mediate functionally important oligomerizations. future functional studies will clarify the roles of these proteins in fungal nox functions.

predicted binding partners for d. discoideum p67-like protein
like fungal noxrs, the pb <dig> domain of d. discoideum p67-like protein also possesses two basic residues, lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> residues, as shown in figure 5e. a blast search demonstrates that the d. discoideum genome possesses five predicted pb <dig> domain-containing proteins . all except dd-pb1-d conserve the opca motif . dd-pb1-a protein  is partially identical to d. discoideum mek kinase α   <cit> . it is possible that the serine/threonine kinase domain might phosphorylate the amoebal noxes or the p67-like protein to stimulate ros generation, analogous to other regulatory phosphorylations of nox and their regulatory subunits  <cit> . another interesting point of the dd-pb1-a protein is to contain the f-box and a wd <dig> repeat regions that function as a ubiquitin ligase component e <dig>  further investigations to identify a binding partner will lead to understand functional relationships between nox and the dd-pb <dig> proteins.

do p67phox-like genes exist in plants?
the land plants, a. thaliana and o. sativa possess the multiple ef-hand-containing nox proteins, at-rboh-a to -j  <cit>  and os-rboh-a  <cit>  to -h, respectively. however, there is no report of phox-related regulatory subunit homologs in plant genomes. unexpectedly blast search using pb <dig> domain sequences demonstrates that a. thaliana possesses a unique family of genes encoding four proteins that possess both tpr and pb <dig> domains . the o. sativa genome also possesses a similar gene . herein, we refer to this family as "hypothetical p67phox-like ". the expressions of at least the two identified genes, at-hypo-p67-l <dig> and -l <dig>  were confirmed according to the est database  <cit> .

domain structures of the a. thaliana and o. sativa hypo-p67-l proteins are shown in figure 14a . the six residues characteristic of the pb <dig> domains are conserved in all sequences . this predicts that the hypo-p67-l proteins will form a heteromeric or homomeric complex via pb1-pb1-interaction. in addition to the hypo-p67-l gene family, the a. thaliana genome possessed at least  <dig> isolated genes encoding the pb <dig> domain . alignment of putative ad-like domains of the a. thaliana proteins with human p67phox and noxa <dig> show that the a. thaliana hypo-p67-l <dig> and -l <dig> proteins conserve the functionally critical valine residue . moreover, a lysine residue corresponding to lys- <dig> of human p67phox that is correlated to the appearance of functional pb <dig> domain is also conserved in two of them . on the other hand, the sequences do not conserve residues in the tpr domain known to be essential for binding to rac  <cit> . biological functions for this putative family are unknown and further investigations are needed.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we reported here an exhaustive analysis of the phox-related regulatory subunits for nox enzymes from a total of  <dig> species in the eukaryota including  <dig> vertebrates. the present study, viewed in the context of the evolution of noxes  <cit> , reveals that regulatory subunits co-evolved with their respective noxes; nox <dig> with p67phox/p47phox; nox <dig> with noxo1/noxa1; ancestral nox <dig> as co-ortholog of vertebrate nox1- <dig> with p67phox/p47phox-like proteins; fungal and amoebal noxa/b with noxr . by comparing amino acid sequences of the regulatory subunits, putative key amino acid residues and conserved region previously undefined were identified, e.g. adsis. these conserved residues are likely to be important in conserved catalytic or regulatory functions of nox proteins, although, the detailed biochemical roles of most of these residues are not yet fully understood. the analysis of the phox-related regulatory subunits points to a novel evolutionary history of nox regulatory proteins. the earliest nox <dig> and p47phox- and p22phox-like genes are appearing in the unicellular choanoflagellate before the emergence of the metazoa. duplication of primordial p47phox- and p67phox-like genes occurred in vertebrates, resulting in the emergence of noxo1-p47phox and noxa1-p67phox genes, respectively. supporting this evolutionary origin, the noxo <dig> protein in the fish o. latipes still retains the p47phox-characteristic "air". a predicted motif structure of ancestral p47phox suggests a greatly expanded family of p47phox including sh3pxd <dig> in the animal lineages. detailed sequence analyses proposed an evolution model that p40phox originally participated in regulating both nox <dig> and nox <dig> in early vertebrates, but in mammals the regulation of nox <dig> became independent of p40phox. thus, this report provides keys to understand the evolutionary history of nox and the regulatory subunits, and provides new information that may be useful in elucidating new molecular details of the activation mechanisms of nox enzymes including the human orthologs.

note: while we were in the process of revising this manuscript, a review article about structure and function of the pb <dig> domain appeared  <cit> . the review will help to understand the structural features of the pb <dig> domain that are often mentioned in the present study. in the article, authors also described the presence of the hypothetical genes coding tpr and pb <dig> domain-containing proteins in the a. thaliana genomes and argued about a possibility of a. thaliana p67phox.
