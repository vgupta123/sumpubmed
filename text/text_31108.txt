BACKGROUND
transcription factors are important regulators of cellular processes, and the complexity of living organisms necessitates a large number of transcription factors. the zinc finger motifs, which are classified based on the arrangement of the zinc-binding amino acids, are present in many transcription factors and play critical roles in interactions with other molecules  <cit> . a large amount of zinc-finger transcription factors are implicated in important biological processes and many of them often share common characteristic to form a family. so far, several zinc finger families have been found in plants, such as ring-finger, erf, wrky, dof and lim family  <cit> . however, most of them are identified as dna-binding or protein-binding proteins, fewer function as rna-binding proteins.

the ccch zinc finger motif has been found in proteins from organisms ranging from man to yeast  <cit> . the ccch proteins are a large family of zinc finger containing c3h-type motifs and many evidences proved that they may be rna-binding proteins functioning in rna processing  <cit> . in mouse, tristetraprolin, a protein containing two ccch zinc fingers, binds directly to au-rich elements within the 3'-untranslated region of target transcripts to facilitate mrna degradation  <cit> . zfp36l <dig>  like its better-known relative ttp, is a mrna-binding and destabilizing protein, functions in the physiological control of female fertility at the level of early embryonic development  <cit> . the pie- <dig> is an essential regulator of caenorhabditis elegans germ cell fate that segregates with the germ lineage by inhibition of transcription or activation of protein expression from maternal rnas  <cit> . compared to animals, only a few of plant ccch proteins have been characterized functionally. in arabidopsis thaliana, hua <dig> has been proved to be a rna-binding protein and likely participates in a new regulatory mechanism governing flower development  <cit> . atcpsf <dig> encodes a small polypeptide which shares the probable ortholog of the 30-kd subunit of the mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor, and it was shown to be nucleus-localized rna-binding protein that binds calmodulin  <cit> . pei <dig> is an embryo-specific ccch zinc finger protein that plays an important role during arabidopsis embryogenesis, functioning primarily in the apical domain of the embryo  <cit> . fes <dig> interacts genetically with fri and frl <dig> to promote the winter-annual habit of arabidopsis and might be involved in the processing of mrna  <cit> . in rice , osdos is a nuclear protein that delays leaf senescence by integrating developmental cues to the jasmonate  pathway  <cit> . it was also proposed to play a role in posttranscriptional level by interacting with target rna.

given the potential for ccch proteins to function diverse roles by associating with rna and most of members containing ccch motif remaining poorly understood, it was of considerable interest to us to characterize the plant ccch gene family. the availability of the arabidopsis and oryza sativa genome sequences allows the genome-wide comparative analysis of gene families between monocot and eudicot plants  <cit> .

perl is one of the most widely used programming languages for managing and manipulating life-science information  <cit> . perl has been extremely successful for connecting software applications together into sequence analysis pipelines, converting file formats, and extracting information from the output of analysis programs and other text files  <cit> .

in this study, we wrote perl program to search against the entire genome of two species and performed a genome-wide analysis of the ccch gene family in oryza sativa and arabidopsis. a total of  <dig> ccch genes from arabidopsis and  <dig> from oryza sativa were identified and most of them have not been reported previously. phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ccch families in arabidopsis and oryza sativa were divided into  <dig> and  <dig> subfamilies, respectively. expression studies indicated that ccch proteins exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions. detailed analysis of the higher plant-specific subfamily ix of arabidopsis revealed its involvement in response to various stresses. our genomics analysis provides the framework for future studies to dissect the function of this emerging family of potential rna-binding proteins.

RESULTS
identification of genes coding for ccch zinc finger protein in arabidopsis
the previous research revealed that ccch zinc finger protein contained 1– <dig> copies of c3h-type zinc-finger motifs characterized by three cys and one his . berg et al. defined that the ccch family is a group of zinc-finger protein consisting of canonical c-x-c-x-c-x-h motif   <cit> . based on the different amino acid spacing numbers between cys and his in zinc finger motif, we divided the family into  <dig> groups . the protein containing the motif within these groups was considered as a candidate member of ccch family.

b the ccch motifs that were not referred in the studies of berg et al.  <cit> .

to uncover the entire family of genes coding for ccch zinc finger protein in arabidopsis, we analyzed the proteome data with a program written by perl , in which a regular expression  was used to search for the ccch motifs. sequences that matched the criteria within  <dig> groups could be easily detected by the program and were considered as putative ccch proteins.

in addition, to verify the reliability of our result, we performed multiple blast algorithms to search against the corresponding data set using the known ccch proteins got from several database as our query . another program written by perl was used to parse the results and exclude the redundant entries from the initial data set.

the perl program could identify all the amino acid sequences included the ones which do not belong to ccch family. for instance, the sequences "cirleayedcieyfvclngh" in at5g <dig> could be detected as a c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h motif. our comparison analysis showed that the entries obtained from perl program contained all the entries obtained from blast searches. thus, the data got from perl program were used for further analysis.

subsequently, we performed smart and pfam analysis to find the putative ccch protein sequences  <cit> . seventy-nine proteins with typical ccch motif encoded by  <dig> genes were detected from the original data, and five of them, at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  contained a predicted ccch motif with low confidence values. the proteins which were not detected by smart and pfam were eliminated from our study. for at3g <dig>  which could not be detected by smart and pfam but has a sister gene in genome duplication region and contains a c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h motif, was also considered as a member of ccch zinc-finger family. in addition, we wrote another program to analyse the type of ccch motifs based on the residue number between the four conserved amino acids . if a new motif was not referred in the  <dig> groups, we modified our perl program with the new motif to search against the entire proteome again. for instance, when a detected c-x8-c-x6-c-x3-h motif was not mentioned by berg et al., we rewrote new regular expression for matching the sequences of this motif. after verifying the reliability of the new motif in the protein by smart and pfam, we added it to the ccch family. the motifs which were not mentioned by berg et al. were also listed in table  <dig>  making a total of  <dig> groups.

community microarray data, massively parallel signature sequencing searches, and ests database provided confirmative transcript information for all  <dig> genes . from the above evidences, no pseudogene was found among the  <dig> genes. the ccch genes were listed in table  <dig> and their entry numbers were assigned according to the order of ccch genes appearing on the arabidopsis chromosomes, from the short arm to the long arm, and from chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis of the ccch proteins in arabidopsis
to evaluate the evolutionary relationships within the ccch gene family in arabidopsis, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> arabidopsis protein sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree . although the signature ccch motif of the ccch proteins is well conserved, the motif number of each protein and spacing amino acids between adjacent ccch zinc-finger motifs are diverse, so it is difficult to make alignment using ccch motifs. accordingly, an alignment of full-length ccch proteins was constructed using clustalx and refined manually  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree was generated with the neighbor-joining method  <cit> . for statistical reliability, we conducted bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replicates. the tree topologies are similar with different tree-building methods except in deep nodes. from the values obtained in the bootstrap analysis, it is apparent that the phylogenetic relationship is unclear and the bootstrap values are low in deep nodes. nevertheless, in outer clades, the ccch protein has better resolution, permitting subfamilies of proteins to be delimited. this phenomenon was also observed in the analysis of the bhlh  <cit> , dof  <cit> , wrky  <cit> , and iqd  <cit>  transcription factor families. alternatively, it may be due to the divergence of the ccch motif, especially the diverse motif numbers and spacing in the amino acid sequences between cys and his in each protein. we could not infer evolutionary relationships between the different subfamilies of ccch proteins because the internal nodes did not show high support. by contrast, within each subfamily, the strong amino acid sequence conservation is evident from the short branch lengths at the tips of the tress, suggestive of strong evolutionary relationships among subfamily members.

based on the statistical support of each branch, we divided the arabidopsis ccch family into  <dig> subfamilies, which was supported by more than 90% bootstrap value, designated i to xi . the genes with low bootstrap value were not divided into subfamilies, and also were not taken into consideration for further analysis. the genes clustered pairwisely and supported by bootstrap value  <dig> are mostly paralogous genes in arabidopsis. totally,  <dig> pairs of putative paralogous genes were found in arabidopsis.

the analysis of protein motif and gene structure
to discover motifs shared among related proteins within the family, we used meme  <cit> , which performs motif searches in groups of related dna or protein sequences. the search was performed separately for each of the subfamilies of proteins. moreover, smart and pfam were used to annotate the motifs found by meme. as expected, the proteins within same subfamily exhibit the common ccch motifs, suggesting the major functional role of ccch motif in these proteins, although few motifs outside the ccch domain were detected by meme as well. the schemes of the protein motifs of the individual members of the ccch family clearly demonstrate structural similarities among the proteins within one subfamily . for example, the members of subfamily iv contain tandem wd <dig> domains. all eleven members of subfamily ix consist of three highly conserved tandem motifs  and nine members of subfamily i contain five c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h zinc finger motifs. furthermore, twelve proteins contain well-defined rna-binding domain rrm or kh motifs suggesting their potential roles involved in rna binding  <cit> .

the gene structures in terms of intron number and gene length were also consistent with the phylogenetic subfamilies defined in figure  <dig>  most members in same subfamilies had similar intron/exon structure. the fact that they not only contain common motifs but also share very similar intron/exon structure supports their close evolutionary relationship and membership in the same subfamily. taken together, our results validate the classification of the ccch family genes of arabidopsis.

evolution and divergence of the ccch family genes in arabidopsis
the arabidopsis genome has undergone several rounds of genome-wide duplication events, including polyploidy  <cit> , which has great impact on the amplification of members of a gene family in the genome. to further investigate the relationship between the genetic divergence within the ccch family and gene duplication in arabidopsis, the chromosomal location of each ccch gene was determined from the genomic sequences of arabidopsis  <cit> . based on the chromosomal location information provided by the ncbi  <cit>  and tair  <cit> , we localized  <dig> ccch genes in arabidopsis chromosomes and determined that the genes are distributed across all five chromosomes . relatively low densities of ccch genes were observed in some chromosomal regions, including the top of chromosome  <dig>  and the bottom of chromosome  <dig>  twenty-two genes were found in previously identified duplicated segmental regions on chromosomes that are the result of a polyploidy that occurred around  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago, probably close to the emergence of the crucifer family  <cit> . another seven gene pairs  were identified to share common gene structure and zinc finger motif. although blanc et al. did not include the seven gene pairs as duplicated pair genes in recently duplicated segmental chromosomes, the phylogenetic relationship and sequence similarity suggest that they are closely related to each other. furthermore, atc3h <dig> and atc3h <dig> were listed as duplicated genes in the segmental duplications dataset maintained from tigr. therefore, they were considered to be putative duplicated genes . consequently, about 53% of ccch genes, which lie within recently duplicated segmental chromosomes, have a clear relative in these regions. since the density of the duplicated genes in recently duplicated segmental chromosomes was reported to be  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  <cit> , the duplicated pairs of ccch genes have been preferentially retained compared with other genes. this finding is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that duplicated genes involved in signal transduction and transcription are preferentially retained  <cit> . in summary, large-scale segmental duplication events appear to have exclusively contributed to the current complexes of the ccch gene family.

in order to test whether ccch family is ubiquitous in other organisms, ccch genes in moss were also identified. although ests are incomplete, a preliminary examination using the blast program suggested that almost all of the ccch genes belonging to subfamily i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, x and xi in arabidopsis have corresponding homologous members in moss. for subfamily viii, since only  <dig> members are present in arabidopsis, it is difficult to detect their corresponding homologous genes in the incomplete est database of moss. however, the subfamily ix, which contains  <dig> genes in arabidopsis, is not extracted in moss, suggesting that it is a particular subfamily only belonging to advanced plants or arises from the evolutionary process to adapt the circumstance.

to explore the evolutionary history of the ccch gene family in greater detail and to testify our assumption about subfamily ix, we searched publicly available genomic and est databases for all angiosperm species represented in the tigr plant gene indices as well as for the gymnosperm pinus ssp.  <cit> . as expected, almost all of the members in arabidopsis have their counterparters in these higher plants. these results suggest that the basis of the phylogenetic topology of the ccch family had already been established before the divergence of vascular plants and the subfamily ix may be a special subfamily belonging only to higher plant.

identification of ccch genes in rice
rice is one of the most important food crops in the world and it has been used as a major model species in plant  functional genomics research because of its relatively small genome size and extensively sequenced genome  <cit> . to explore the occurrence and size of the ccch gene family in rice, we wrote a perl program to analyze the genome file of rice  got from the tigr rice genome annotation database and resource . multiple blast searches were also performed in several rice databases using the typical ccch protein sequence as the queries to validate the primary results. after detecting the ccch motifs by smart and pfam,  <dig> ccch genes were identified in rice . to determine their phylogenetic relationships, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the full length protein sequences. like the ccch protein family in arabidopsis, the phylogenetic analysis reveals  <dig> subfamilies supported by high bootstrap values. the members of same subfamily share the similar gene structure and zinc finger motifs . we also detected two large subfamilies in the tree, in which the members share the same characteristic with the genes of corresponding subfamilies in arabidopsis. unlike the arabidopsis ccch family, the distribution of ccch genes in the rice genome is clearly biased towards the chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> . four ccch genes are each found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and only one gene, however, is present on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the topology of the phylogenetic tree of rice ccch genes indicates  <dig> pairs of putative duplicated genes that are close paralogs . these genes represent 39% of the rice ccch gene family members and might have evolved from putative rice genome duplication events.

comparative phylogenetic analyses of the ccch genes in arabidopsis and rice
in order to evaluate the evolutionary relationship among the ccch proteins, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length amino acid sequences of arabidopsis and rice. because of the large number of taxa and relatively small number of characters in full-length sequences, the bootstrap values of internal nodes were low, whereas the outer nodes had more credible bootstrap values, allowing for clustering of the ccch genes of arabidopsis and rice into  <dig> subfamilies . the tree topology, as well as the subfamily organization, resembled those from the rice and arabidopsis individual trees. eight subfamilies from arabidopsis and rice clustered together into the same branch in the combined tree and  <dig> putative orthologs were identified in the tree , suggesting that an ancestral set of ccch genes already existed before the monocot-eudicot divergence. moreover, the paralogous genes of arabidopsis and rice were already displayed as paralogs in the respective trees.

despite the differences in genome sizes between arabidopsis and rice  and encoded number of genes, the two plant species appear to have a very similar number of genes encoding ccch zinc-finger proteins . compared with other gene families in arabidopsis and rice, the ccch gene family is one of the largest families in plant and includes diverse members with distinct specificities. as shown in figure  <dig>  the proteins containing c-x7–8-c-x5-c-x3-h motif constitute the largest groups in the ccch zinc-finger family. in arabidopsis,  <dig> members contain c-x7-c-x5-c-x3-h motif and  <dig> members contain c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h motif, while the number is  <dig> and  <dig> in rice, respectively, suggesting that c-x7–8-c-x5-c-x3-h motif may be an ancestor of other ccch motifs. in addition, five novel ccch motifs beyond the  <dig> groups were identified, including c-x4-c-x5-c-x3-h, c-x5-c-x4-c-x3-h, c-x7-c-x6-c-x3-h, c-x8-c-x6-c-x3-h and c-x15-c-x5-c-x3-h. further experiments are required to determine their binding activity to zn2+ and biological functions.

to determine sequence features of these ccch motifs, we performed sequence alignments of  <dig> ccch motifs  using the clustal x program  <cit> . the weblogo indicated that four  amino acids are completely conserved among all the ccch motifs and more than 75% of the ccch motifs contain glycine and phenylalanine   <cit> . in addition, the distributions of conserved amino acids among the ccch motifs of both arabidopsis and rice are similar. given these characteristic of verified protein sequences, we developed a new criteria to objectively define those sequences to be considered as ccch motif. the ccch proteins are characterized by one to six c-x4–15-c-x4–6-c-x3-h motifs which are glycine-rich and phenylalanine-rich sequences.

the expression pattern of ccch genes in arabidopsis and rice
since gene expression patterns can provide important clues for gene function, we examined the expression of arabidopsis and rice ccch genes in root, leaf, flower and seed tissues using massively parallel signature sequencing  data and est data of ncbi   <cit> . in arabidopsis, expression profiles of  <dig> and  <dig> ccch genes were extracted from mpss and est databases, respectively. after integrating two data together, we found that most of the genes have a very broad expression spectrum, and only six genes  were not detected from any specific tissue according to est and mpss data. except atc3h <dig>  five of these six genes were detected in mix tissue of arabidopsis from est database. furthermore, we also summarized the expression of rice ccch genes using the same methods. expression of  <dig> rice ccch genes was detected from mpss database, and  <dig> had matching ests. thirteen ccch genes in rice had no tissue expression pattern, while eight of them contain corresponding ests and five  without expression information might be pseudogenes, or expressed at specific developmental stages or under special conditions.

by combining the est and mpss results together, we found that the accumulation of ccch gene transcripts not only is associated with different tissues, but also the expression pattern of each ccch gene member differed. according to expression profiles, ccch genes can be classified into three groups. the largest group is the genes that expressed in all tissues, including  <dig> genes in arabidopsis and  <dig> genes in rice, and the second group contains  <dig> arabidopsis ccch genes and  <dig> rice ccch genes whose expression were detected in the majority, but not all, of the tissues. interestingly, the third group includes  <dig> genes with very specific expression. atc3h <dig> and atc3h <dig> are exclusively expressed in roots, while atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  osc3h <dig> and osc3h <dig> in inflorescences, atc3h <dig>  osc3h <dig> and osc3h <dig> in leaves, atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  osc3h <dig> and osc3h <dig> in seeds. when compared the expression pattern of the atc3h <dig>  which could not be detected by smart and pfam but contains a c-x8-c-x5-c-x3-h motif, with its sister gene atc3h <dig>  we found that they share different expression profiles with relatively low level . in addition, we examined the expression of other ccch duplicated gene pairs of both arabidopsis and rice, and only  <dig> of  <dig> pairs  share the same expression pattern. these results are consistent with the previous research by blanc and wolfe, that the expression profiles of the two paralogs have diverged in concert, forming two parallel networks, and the expression of each gene is strongly correlated with the other nonhomologous genes in its network but poorly correlated with its paralog in the other network, suggesting functional diversification of the surviving duplicated genes is a major feature of the long-term evolution of polyploids  <cit> .

expression profiling within different tissues is only the first step to understanding the function of ccch genes. overall, the ccch family members show diverse expression patterns. a majority of the ccch genes are expressed in all tissues tested, with various expression levels. it might be a common character of large transcription factor families, such as myb family  <cit> . in addition, the genes with specific expression patterns can be the focus of functional studies for their possible roles in specific tissues. because of the limitation of current information from mpss and est databases, expression of some genes within the tissues might not be detected. further investigation of spatial and developmental expression patterns will need to be performed to obtain more detailed expression information.

characteristics of subfamily ix genes of arabidopsis and subfamily i genes of rice
subfamily ix containing  <dig> members in arabidopsis and subfamily i containing  <dig> members in rice are the largest ccch subfamily in each species, respectively. all the proteins encoded by these  <dig> genes include two ccch motifs. with the exception of osc3h <dig>  osc3h <dig> and osc3h <dig> in rice, the products of  <dig> genes commonly contain two tandem consensus motifs, c-x7–8-c-x5-c-x3-h and c-x5-c-x4-c-x3-h. in osc3h <dig> and osc3h <dig> proteins, the first zinc finger is replaced by a c-x10-c-x5-c-x3-h motif, while in osc3h <dig> the first zinc finger is c-x15-c-x5-c-x3-h. amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all twenty members contain highly conserved c-x5-c-x4-c-x3-h motif, which is a characteristic of these proteins. additionally, putative consensus chch  motif was also observed in these  <dig> proteins, implying that it may be a novel zinc finger motif and execute some biological functions . moreover, the number of amino acids between the three motifs is invariable and all the  <dig> genes have no introns .

as shown in figure 9a, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the subfamily ix of arabidopsis consists of two major subgroups. interestingly, with exception of two ccch motifs, ankyrin  repeat motif was also identified by meme search using amino acid sequences of all members of subgroup  <dig> . the ank repeat motif is one of the most common protein-protein interaction motifs in nature, and it has been found in proteins of diverse function such as transcriptional initiators, ion transporters and signal transducers  <cit> . the database search further revealed that only six genes coding proteins with ank repeats and zinc finger domains in whole arabidopsis genome, five of them belong to ccch subfamily ix. in addition, to evaluate the evolutionary relationships within the  <dig> genes, we performed a combined phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> arabidopsis and rice amino acid sequences to obtain a joint tree. three subgroups can be observed from the combined tree . in subgroup  <dig> of the combined tree, all nine genes of both arabidopsis and rice contain the ank domain. surprisingly, within each subgroup, the rice and arabidopsis genes appear closely related to genes of the same species, and only one putative ortholog pairs  were identified in the combined tree. one possible explanation of this phenomenon is that these genes may go through a complex and extensive evolution in each species after monocot-eudicot divergence.

previous studies demonstrated that osdos, atcpsf <dig> and hua <dig> are nuclear-localized proteins  <cit> . the database research with full-length protein sequences of subfamily ix of arabidopsis and subfamily i of rice suggested that all members are localized in the cell nucleus . in animal, ttp was shown to export from the nucleus mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal . to our knowledge, no leucine-rich nes in plant proteins has been identified. when we performed our program using the developed widely accepted nes consensus -x--x-l-x- to detect  <dig> arabidopsis ccch proteins  <cit> ,  <dig> proteins containing putative nes sequences were identified including all of  <dig> members of subfamily ix . the result suggests that all subfamily ix proteins of arabidopsis may be nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins involved in signal transduction events  <cit> .

recently, a few genes within these  <dig> genes have been shown to play crucial roles in abiotic and/or biotic stress-responsive gene expression. osdos  was proved to be involved in ja pathway  <cit> . zfar <dig>  transcript was induced by botrytis in inoculated arabidopsis lines and zfar <dig> mutant was hypersensitive to aba  <cit> . in order to better understand the function of these genes, we firstly examined the expression of all the genes of subfamily ix of arabidopsis in response to multiple environmental stimuli by means of microarray data available at genevestigator site  <cit> . the results revealed that all genes of subfamily ix were activated or suppressed by various stresses, including salt, cold, mannitol, aba, hypoxia and osmotic stress . secondly, we analyzed the expression of these  <dig> genes in arabidopsis plants treated with drought , salt, cold, and aba by rt-pcr. as shown in figure 10b, the rt-pcr results are in better agreement with the microarray data, suggesting their involvement in abiotic and/or biotic stress.

rna-binding roles for ccch proteins
recently, the structure of the ccch domain from the tis11d in complex with rna monomer of au-rich element  have been determined  <cit> . sequences alignment show that among  <dig> ccch proteins in arabidopsis and rice, atc3h <dig>  atc3h <dig>  osc3h <dig> and osc3h <dig> share high amino acid sequence identities with tis11d . like the tis11d, each of these four proteins contains two tandem  ccch zinc fingers and a linker of  <dig> residues between the two zinc finger motifs. in addition, many other residues are strictly conserved. to obtain insights of the structure of plant ccch zinc finger, we have taken the coordinates of the tis11d ccch domain complex and modelled the structure of the interaction of the atc3h <dig>  ccch domain peptide with the rna nonamer , using the swiss-model programs  <cit> . it is apparent that the rna-binding domain of the atc3h <dig> is likely to be identical in structure to that of tis11d. compared with the structure of tis11d, the characteristic ktel motif at the n-terminus of each zinc finger domain provides a critical part of the rna-binding surface; each motif forms two walls of a deep pocket that accommodates the bases of u <dig> and u <dig> in fingers  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the model illustrates the aromatic stack formed from u2-phe293-a <dig>  u4-tyr287-u <dig>  u6-phe255-a <dig> and u8-tyr249-u <dig>  which are essential for high-affinity binding. mutation within these critical hydrophobic amino acids might make the domain abrogate rna binding . further mutagenesis experiments would be required to establish the contributions of these residues to binding affinity.

in mammals, some proteins containing tandem ccch domains, such as ttp and tis11d, have been proved to bind to the class ii are in the 3'-untranslated region  of target mrnas and promote their deadenylation and degradation  <cit> . ares are sequence elements of 50– <dig> nt that are rich in adenosine and uridine bases. they are located in the 3'-utrs of many but not all mrnas that have a short half-life and have been identified by their capacity to provoke degradation of the host mrna by a mechanism dependent on deadenylation. it has been estimated that 5–8% of human genes code for are-containing mrnas, and the corresponding proteins perform a variety of functions implicated in numerous transient biological processes  <cit> . henceforth, only two plant ccch  proteins have been proved to have the rna-binding ability by experimental evidence. extraction of are-containing mrnas in 3'-utr of arabidopsis genome was performed using patmatch tools of tair. the 3'-utrs were searched for the 13-bp pattern wwwuuuuw. totally, we identified  <dig> genes containing  <dig> are in their 3'-utr mrna . the potential relationship between the plant ccch proteins and the au-rich mrna need been confirmed by experiment approaches in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a new method employed regular expression of perl to identify the gene family. by this method,  <dig> and  <dig> ccch genes were identified in arabidopsis and rice, respectively, and they formed  <dig> subfamilies that were supported by phylogeny, protein motifs and intron/exon structures. compared with other gene families in rice and arabidopsis, the ccch gene family is one of the largest families in plants. gene duplication analysis revealed that during the expansion of the ccch gene family, many subfamilies and subgroups have evolved, resulting in a high level of functional divergence. most of the subfamilies/subgroups are present both in arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that the appearance of many of the genes in these species predates monocot/eudicot divergence. members within a given subfamily/subgroup may have recent common evolutionary origins and may possess common zinc finger motifs that have related molecular functions. available data supported the hypothesis that ccch genes in plants perform a variety of functions in different tissues at multiple developmental stages. the subfamily ix of arabidopsis with many interesting characters was investigated in details, in which members are shown to be involved in plant stress responses. we then proposed that the genes of subfamily ix possibly play roles as nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins involved in signal transduction events. although the function of most plant ccch genes is unknown, the phylogenetic and expression analyses provide a solid foundation for future functional studies in both arabidopsis and rice. overall, we have identified a novel zinc finger family and results presented here can serve as useful information for guiding future experimental work and understanding the structure-function relationship of the members of the ccch gene family.
