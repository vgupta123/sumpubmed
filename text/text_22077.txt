BACKGROUND
a regulatory module is a set of genes that is regulated or co-regulated by one or more common transcription factors . a tf is a protein that binds to a cis-regulatory element  and thereby, directly or indirectly, positively or negatively affects the initiation of transcription of regulated genes. a cancer-related regulatory module is a set of genes  that is regulated by one ore more common tfs. modeling the cancer-related regulatory modules of the cell division cycle in human cells is a critical and fundamental step toward understanding cancers. the aim of this paper is not only to drive cancer-related regulatory modules, but also to identify the relationships of regulations between genes that fit the feed-forward or feedback influences. a feed-forward regulatory module, contains a tf that controls a second tf at later time points and has the additional feature that both tfs bind to common target genes. therefore, the major contribution of this study is regarding the chain influences upon a set of genes sequentially. that is, to construct a simple cancer-related regulatory pathway with feedback loop and feed-forward controlled relationships achieved by modified recurrent neural network  architecture  <cit> . combining modified multi-layer rnn with the global searching ability of genetic algorithms   <cit> , this approach can efficiently select regulated target genes as well. we also provide the solution of analysis time-course gene expression data. for example, one particular tf expressed highly in s/g <dig> phase may regulate its target genes expressed highly in the m  phase. that is, our modified ga-rnn hybrid algorithm has the capability of finding target regulated genes at a later time point  when given a tf at an earlier time point .

machine learning approaches to microarray analysis
there are many types of gene transcriptional regulatory related approaches which have been proposed in the past. their nature and composition are categorized by several factors: considering gene expression values  <cit> , the causal relationship between genes, e.g. with bayesian analysis or dynamic bayesian networks <cit> , and the time domain e.g. discrete or continuous time  <cit> . the genome-wide transcriptional program during the cell cycle has been investigated in a wide range of organisms, including yeast  <cit> , bacteria  <cit> , primary human fibroblasts  <cit> , and human hela cells  <cit> . however, consideration of feedback and feed-forward control in regulatory modules is also important. that is, some genes have unique characteristics, for instance, they regulate themselves or they regulate genes in the following further time points. unfortunately, constructing regulatory modules with feedback and feed-forward controls is not mentioned by  <cit> . moreover, genes may have one or more activators or inhibitors which co-regulate the transcription levels of genes in regulatory modules. lots of the cell's activities are organized as sets of genes co-regulated by some particular tfs to respond to different conditions. therefore, the present challenge is to understand how transcription factors control global gene expression programs, i.e., specific gene expression programs involve regulated transcription of many other genes in different time points or involve regulated transcription of themselves. our approach aims to provide a system to construct regulatory modules with feedback and feed-forward control mechanisms that illustrate cancer-related genes and their cause-effect relations to other genes.

recent approaches to gene expression of human cancers
gene expression profiling has been widely used for cancer research. the results provided by  <cit>  and  <cit>  have shown that co-expression of gene pairs in multiple data sets are correlated with functional relatedness. according to  <cit> , they seek pairs of genes based on the correlation of their expression profiles in multiple data sets, and define these pairs of genes reliably co-expressed to establish a high-confidence network of more than  <dig>  genes connected by co-expression links that are observed in the data sets. however, global co-expression patterns have not been determined for cancer, and it is still unknown what are the key genes or gene groups that have been causing or stabilizing the observed global cancer-related patterns. likewise, it is of interest to know which genes are the factors that initiate the regulation to another possibly pathological state. hence, we try to deal with this problem by identifying genes whose regulatory functions have interventions in the global cancer-related gene expression profiles.

RESULTS
results of human cancer data
the human cell cycle data set consists of almost  <dig>  genes and over  <dig> time points for each of the experimental data. as a result, the number of gene combinations is more significant than the yeast data set. we list some experimental results in table  <dig>  in these experiments, the number of epochs of rnn is  <dig>  and the number of generations of ga is varied while recording the error rates for the training data. the minimum value of rmse decreases as the number of ga generation increases.

notice that the minimum rmse for ga generations  <dig> and  <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. comparing these two experimental results, although the number of ga generations is supplementary, there is no conspicuous diminishing for the value of rmse. moreover, the maximum number of ga generations for the yeast data set is less than half of the human data set. searching for "good" combinations of regulated target genes from the human data set yields much more permutations than yeast.

we also demonstrate some relationships of cancer-related regulation in figure  <dig>  the e2f <dig> gene has been biologically proven a key regulator of the cell cycle. as noted by stanelle et al.  <cit> , the p16/rb/e2f regulatory pathway, which controls transit through the g <dig> restriction point of the cell cycle, is one of the most frequent targets of genetic alterations in human cancer. likewise, figure  <dig> shows the same idea of the e2f <dig> and rb regulatory relationship, and also proves the ability of our system. it is also known that, e2f <dig> participates in the progress of apoptosis by regulating p <dig>  and this is indicated in figure  <dig> as well. p <dig> is a tumor suppressor whose inactivation is observed in most human cancers  <cit> . p <dig> also plays a central role in regulating cell growth, particularly in response to various forms of stress, including dna damage and viral infection, because p <dig> sits on a critical node of signal transduction networks that control cell growth and death. figure  <dig> illustrates that pcaf is a co-activator of p <dig> transcription identified by our system, which is biologically supported by zhao et al.  <cit> . the same as cdc <dig>  pcaf is identified as an auto-regulated tf, moreover, it up-regulates the nicd, cbf <dig>  and brca <dig> target genes. more results and biological evidences are provided in additional file  <dig> 

compare human cancer data results to yeast cell cycle
an example of periodically expressed gene in human cells but not in yeast is the human cdk <dig> . yeast kin <dig> is not found as a tf at the transcriptional level, but the cdk <dig> is a tf that regulates mo <dig>  human gene cdc <dig> is homologous of s. cerevisiae cdc <dig>  which is identified by our system, and is an auto-regulated and crucial tf to gcn <dig>  prb, and nicd genes while yeast cdc <dig> is not. the most interesting and complicated gene of the human data set that system came out is e2f <dig>  it is likely that some of the periodically expressed genes in human cell that do not have periodically expressed correspondents in yeast are subject to multiple layers of regulation. it is also reasonable that, multi-layer regulation in human cell, such as the phosphorylation and proteolysis, are known for some well-studied cell cycle genes. therefore, the regulatory module starting on e2f <dig> tf shows the chain processes of the regulatory mechanism, which implies the complication of human cancer-related regulatory manipulations. one known gene, p <dig>  also represents an intriguing consequence. after inputting hdac <dig> tf to the ga-rnn algorithm, some negative values are reported by the neural network weight matrix, which indicates inhibitor targets. it appears that there is a similar case, the gata <dig>  down-regulated by hdac <dig> as well, and both are confirmed by juan et al.  <cit>  and ozawa et al.  <cit> . these listed genes are strongly expressed in proliferative tumors, and have regulatory relationships with other genes. this may further prove to be a useful source of additional drug targets of this kind. on the other hand, most of the genes identified by our system periodically expressed in both species are involved in dna replication, dna repair, dna metabolism and mitosis. in the viewpoint of biology, these genes involved in mitosis or dna replication, in all probability, have connections with cancer diseases.

we also show some experimental results with g1/s/g2/m phases in figure  <dig>  the green lines shown in figure  <dig> indicate regulatory connections predicted by this approach. the red lines indicate regulatory connections that predicted by this approach and also are confirmed by biological experiments. the red dotted lines represent the negative regulatory controlling, which are also confirmed by biological experiments. the blue lines shown in figure  <dig> demonstrate the feed-forward controlling between e2f <dig>  rb and the target gene cyca. it is clear that the e2f <dig> is a start tf and controls the second tf, rb. both e2f <dig> and rb regulate the target gene, cyca, which form a feed-forward regulatory motif.

discussion
the construction of cancer-related regulatory modules from temporal expression data is one of the most important problems in computational biology. it is acknowledged that the causes of heterogeneity genetic-related circumstances, such as the cell cycle, or cancer diseases, are products of complex interactions between genes over time. the analysis of cancer-related gene expression data will thus become increasingly widespread. when appraising approaches for discovery of cancer-related regulatory modules, the amount and type of sources of data must be taken into account. besides, the approach must be capable of handling noisy and high dimensional gene expression data. the approach described here has been shown to be effective with real-world expression data. the stochastic nature of ga means that the same results can not be expected from each run of the algorithm, and the ga is run for a fixed number of generations for each output of regulatory modules. however, to increase the number of genes that the ga can select from, it could require more ga generations. as a result, increasing the ga generations also increases the computational time, although it does show that results on microarray data can be discovered correctly by the ga used in our approach. in addition, this approach builds modules "piece by piece", that is, regulatory module by regulatory module. imagine that the network motif described in section  <dig> is one of the transcriptional regulatory mechanism units with a specific set of genes, including the influences and the targets. we discover all the formed units one by one and eventually join these units by their simultaneously existing tfs. the above-mentioned contents are the advantages of generating smaller but more precise regulatory modules, in that each of the paths or the units  in the modules can be seen without being masked by other connections. it is not the same as traditional complicated regulatory relationships, which are too many to visualize as a network to yield useful information in a digestible format for biologists.

compare to related researches
the ordering of regulatory processing can be displayed faithfully by this approach, especially the feed-forward motif, which represents a very simple regulator pathway. the phenomenon of this biology mechanism is often seen but ignored when constructing regulatory modules. bayesian networks have been proven to be an efficient methodology to reveal the cause-effect relationships from microarray experimental data, but may be deficient in dealing with the control of feedback or feed-forward issues. a major contribution provided by this approach is the discovery of not only the cause-effect relationships between genes but also the chain influences upon a set of genes sequentially. the mechanism of chain influences is achieved by modified rnn architecture, which includes the nonlinear mapping capability and the ability of time delay in constructing regulatory modules. the other advantage of this study is the power of global searching for regulated target genes provided by ga. those selected target genes are judged whether they are "true target genes" or not according to the rmse provided by rnn, and the results substantiate the capability of our hybrid ga-rnn method. compared to  <cit>  , this paper limits potential regulators to those genes with either earlier or simultaneous expression changes  in relation to their target genes, which we also achieve the results. moreover, we provide feedback and feed-forward regulation control relations between transcription factors and their targets, that is, we contribute more complicated regulatory relationships of regulatory modules.

compared to keedwell et al.  <cit> , which uses a supervised single-layer artificial neural network  to construct the regulatory connections between genes, the first improvement of our approach is that we use modified multi-layer rnn to complete the feed-forward, feedback, auto-regulate, and multi-input regulatory modules, which means we show clearly the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. secondly, keedwell et al.  <cit>  provided most of the significant connections in the network by repeated ga. in our approach, we intersect the regulatory modules that output from different ga generations. take table  <dig> as an example, the ga generations for human cell cycle data are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. we collect the repeated regulatory modules that are appeared in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> generations. it means that the significant regulatory modules are aggregated. finally, keedwell et al. construct their regulatory connections by microarray expression values; nevertheless, we also consider the transcription factor binding sites sequences, which consider more biological factors while constructing regulatory modules. we also provide more biological evidences for human cell cycle data, and the results compared with  <cit>  are listed in additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we combine the ga and rnn computing approaches to construct the cancer-related regulatory modules in silico. upon the microarray data and the sequences of transcription factor binding sites, the approach has been shown to be able to accurately fit the data on which it is trained. we also observe that some tfs play critical roles in various motifs. in other words, some functions of tfs are fit for several kinds of regulatory modules. we then adopt these characteristics by training the rbf classifier  <cit>  for categorizing tfs. additionally, the experimental results have proven that the ga-rnn hybrid algorithm has the capability of constructing the feedback and feed-forward regulatory modules. rnns with diversified architectures indicate varied regulatory mechanisms to construct complete regulatory modules with feedback and feed-forward controls. combining modified rnn with ga, it provides the global searching capacities to find proper target regulated genes for some tfs. the chromosomes that the ga used are combinations of target genes and the crossover and mutation operators used by ga on all chromosomes alter the choice of output gene combinations. this approach is on the basis of both gene expression data and sequences data, so it is time significant and binding region significant data analysis. summing up, since this method has been previously shown to also classify tfs as well and then construct regulatory modules, it can be considered a candidate multipurpose tool for microarray expression data analysis.
