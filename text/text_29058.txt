BACKGROUND
genetic improvement of grain yield is important for ensuring food security. many important agronomic traits, including yield, show continuous phenotypic variation  <cit> . grain yield is a complex quantitative trait, and is determined by several components including kernel number and kernel weight  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> quantitative trait loci  underlying yield components including kernel row number , kernel number per row , and hundred kernel weight  have been identified across the maize genome using various mapping populations , which has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of maize yield. therefore, grain size and kernel weight are important targets for artificial selection for high grain yield. for example, qtl associated with gs <dig>  <cit>  and gw5/sw <dig>  <cit>  have been selected for grain size in rice. also, qtl associated with tagw2-6a hap-6a-a for grain size  <cit>  and tackx6-d <dig>  <cit>  for grain weight have been identified and artificially selected from within chinese wheat germplasm. markers derived from qtl controlling similar components of grain yield in maize will be very useful for marker-assisted selection.

several genes that control kernel weight or kernel number have been cloned in crops, and some of these genes were found to be involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism  <cit> , protein degradation  <cit> , and hormone metabolism  <cit> . all of these processes affect the production and export of c- and n-assimilates to the seed, thereby increasing crop yield. c- and n-metabolism are essential to all processes in plants, including reproductive development, but are especially so during grain filling  <cit> . among the genes involved in carbon metabolism, rice grain incomplete filling  <dig>  which functions similarly to the invertase encoded by miniature  <dig> in maize  <cit> , also encodes a cell-wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during early grain-filling  <cit> . a gene involved in nitrogen metabolism in rice, osarg, encodes an arginine hydrolase that, when overexpressed, increases grain number per plant under nitrogen-limited conditions, due to increased nitrogen remobilization at the reproductive stage  <cit> .

in addition, degradation of proteins via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway negatively regulates cell division and grain yield. another gene, grain weight  <dig> , which encodes a ring-type e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, functions in ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and the loss of gw <dig> function can enhance rice grain width, weight, and yield  <cit> . furthermore, zmgw2-chr <dig>  which functions in the same manner as gw <dig>  is also associated with kernel width and kernel weight in maize  <cit> . although they have potentially positive impacts on yield, alleles at these loci also should be monitored to avoid possible negative effects of introduced germplasm on yield.

as to the influence of plant hormones, brassinosteroids  and cytokinins  are useful for controlling grain yield in crops. brs stimulate the transport of sucrose and other sugars to the endosperm and embryo. expression of the maize, rice, or arabidopsis thaliana c- <dig> hydroxylase that is involved in br synthesis in stems, leaves, and roots had clear effects on seed weight  <cit> . in rice, the accumulation of ck in the inflorescence meristems increases the number of grains per panicle. the rice gene gn1a encodes an oxidase/dehydrogenase  that functions in the degradation of cks. an 11-bp deletion in its coding region created a premature stop codon that reduced expression of osckx <dig> and resulted in increased grain number  <cit> . in wheat, tackx6-d <dig>  an ortholog of rice osckx <dig>  was significantly associated with 1000-grain weight by linkage mapping and association analysis  <cit> . thus, the ck regulatory pathway likely plays a crucial role in grain yield.

there is also evidence for a role of cks in balancing the source and sink relationship  <cit> . accordingly, exogenous applications of cks increased seed set and yield stability under heat stress in maize  <cit> . cks are co-regulated by isopentenyl transferase  and oxidase/dehydrogenase in plants. the discovery of biosynthetic enzymes ipt <dig> through ipt <dig>  <cit>  and degradative enzymes ckx <dig> through ckx <dig>  <cit>  has led to a better understanding of the role of cks in maize kernel development. among the ipts, ipt <dig> and ipt <dig> are highly abundant and are constitutively expressed in all organs, but other ipt transcripts show distinct spatial and temporal patterns of expression  <cit> . zmipt <dig> is specifically expressed in the pedicel, endosperm, and embryo  <cit> . zmipt <dig> consists of an intronless  <dig> bp coding region for dimethylallyl diphosphate : adenosine triphosphate /adenosine diphosphate  ipt, which preferred atp and adp over adenosine monophosphate  as substrates for ipt activity  <cit> .

to date, the allelic diversity of zmipt <dig> and the most favorable allele affecting kernel weight have not yet been reported for maize. the objectives of this study were to  examine the sequence diversity of zmipt <dig> in  <dig> chinese maize inbred lines;  test associations between nucleotide polymorphisms in zmipt <dig> and various yield components including krn, knpr, and hkw, and identify further favorable allele for grain yield components;  characterize the ipt activity of the protein products of different alleles in vitro; and  investigate selection for favorable zmipt <dig> alleles for kernel weight during maize breeding in china.

RESULTS
phenotypic data
phenotypic values for individual lines ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for krn , from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for knrp , and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g for hkw , as shown in table  <dig>  krn was significantly positively correlated with knpr , while hkw was negatively correlated with knpr . analysis of variance  indicated significant phenotypic variation for krn, knpr, and hkw among these  <dig> maize lines . heritabilities estimated on a per-plot basis were  <dig> % for krn,  <dig> % for knrp, and  <dig> % for hkw.

a because the phenotypic values for some lines were missing for kernel weight, the df differ. the numbers in parentheses indicate the df for hkw and the numbers outside parentheses indicate the df for krn and knpr.

nucleotide diversity in the zmipt <dig> coding region
a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified in the zmipt <dig> coding region, with an average of one snp every  <dig> bp, and six of these variants resulted in amino acid substitutions . seven haplotypes, named hap_ <dig> through hap_ <dig>  were detected in our association panel based on these  <dig> snps . a total of  <dig>  inbred lines harbored hap_ <dig>  while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> inbred lines carried hap_ <dig> through  <dig>  respectively. hap_ <dig> harbored the zmipt2-t allele at snp <dig> , but other haplotypes bore the zmipt2-c allele. the window covering zmipt <dig> exhibited relatively lower diversity with a value of  <dig> , and it was significantly lower than the average diversity value of  <dig>  for chromosome  <dig> across  <dig> maize inbred lines  . most polymorphisms in zmipt <dig> were found in the region from  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  . among maize subgroups revealed by xie et al.  <cit> , subgroups lancaster  and lvda red cob  harbored higher levels of diversity in the zmipt <dig> coding region, compared with the average for all inbreds .

association analysis of krn, knpr, and hkw
association analysis revealed that snp <dig> was significantly associated with hkw across all three environments tested , and explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in hkw at xinjiang in  <dig>   <dig> % of the phenotypic variation at beijing in  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation at xinjiang in  <dig>  significant association of hkw with snp <dig>  snp <dig>  and snp <dig> was detected in one or two environments . however, only snp <dig> was found to be associated with knpr in beijing , and no snp was significantly associated with krn . the inbred lines containing the zmipt2-t allele had significantly  greater kernel weight than those carrying the zmipt2-c allele, as seen in the data from xinjiang in  <dig> and in beijing in  <dig> across this association panel . the p value obtained here supports the strength of the observed association between hkw and snp <dig>  and improves confidence in identification of the zmipt2-t allele in hap_ <dig> as the most favorable allele for kernel weight in maize.

characterization of zmipt2
both the zmipt2-t and zmipt2-c protein alleles have the same pi and aliphatic index. however, the transition at snp <dig> from cytosine  to thymine  converts proline into serine, resulting in a decrease in the hydropathicity of the entire zmipt <dig> protein from − <dig>  to − <dig> , as analyzed using gravy. the ipt coding region aligned with the p-loop ntpase superfamily that is characteristic of all ntp-binding proteins from position  <dig> to  <dig> with an e-value, or probability of a protein sequence of a given bit score occurring by chance, of  <dig> e- <dig>  . the 3-d structure predicted by swiss-model  showed that the spatial structure of zmipt2-t and zmipt2-c differed due to variation in hydrophobicity between the two proteins . these kinds of changes could affect the binding of substrates to the enzyme, which is mediated by hydrogen bonds  <cit> . this mutation and resultant differences in physicochemical properties imply that ipt activity could differ between the protein products of the zmipt2-t and zmipt2-c alleles.

to further confirm the ck biosynthetic function of these two zmipt <dig> products in vitro, escherichia coli prokaryotic expression vectors were constructed to express and purify zmipt <dig> as c-terminal his-tagged recombinant proteins. zmipt2-t and zmipt2-c purified on talon® columns reached 95-100% purity, as quantified by coomassie staining after page . purified proteins were then used to assay dmapp:atp, dmapp:adp, and dmapp:amp transferase activity. figure  <dig> shows the profile obtained from the reaction mixture of purified zmipt <dig> protein incubated with dmapp and substrates, including atp, adp, and amp. zmipt2-t converted amp to isopentenyl adenosine monophosphate  with higher efficiency than did zmipt2-c, as indicated by the amount of ipmp after reaction . the mean amp consumption by zmipt2-t and zmipt2-c were  <dig>  μmol and  <dig>  μmol, respectively . similar results were obtained with atp or adp as the substrate . zmipt2-t consumed more adp and atp, with means of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, than consumed by zmipt2-c. additionally, zmipt2-t consumed much more atp and adp than it did amp, with means of  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold the amount of amp consumed, respectively . these results indicate that the protein product of the zmipt2-t allele has higher ipt enzyme activity and prefers adp as substrate, and so could have a more favorable impact on yield.

selection in the region of the zmipt <dig> locus
a total of  <dig> snps  <cit>  were used to analyze the effects of selection occurring in this region of chromosome  <dig> during selection and breeding. the estimates for π and tajima’s d in the zmipt <dig> window showed lower values than the mean estimates for those parameters for all of maize chromosome  <dig> . tajima’s d tests of the zmipt <dig> coding region and genomic window identified different artificial selection effects across these six maize subgroups, with the largest effect identified in subgroup pb . notably, 81% of inbred lines in subgroup pb harbored the favorable allele zmipt2-t . these results indicate that artificial selection occurred in the genomic region harboring zmipt <dig> during maize breeding.

discussion
grain yield is a complex trait controlled by minor genes
grain yield is one of the most important and complex traits in maize. although many studies on the genetic basis of maize yield-related traits have been reported, few favorable alleles for yield candidate genes have been identified because single genes identified in association studies explain only a small proportion of phenotypic variation. in this study, snp <dig> in the zmipt <dig> coding region was significantly associated with kernel weight across three environments, explaining  <dig> % of phenotypic variation. relatively small allelic effects were also found for one polymorphism in the zmgs <dig> region, which explained  <dig> % of variation in beijing and  <dig> % of that in hainan  <cit> , and another snp, s <dig> in the zmgw2-chr <dig> region, which accounted for less than 10% of variation across three environments  <cit> . thus, the identification and pyramiding of a large number of favorable alleles will be the key to molecular marker-assisted breeding of high-yielding maize.

association mapping of complex traits
as an effective way to dissect complex traits and identify favorable alleles or haplotypes, association mapping has been widely used for many maize traits, including flowering time  <cit> , leaf architecture  <cit> , plant height  <cit> , and disease resistance  <cit> . with candidate-gene association mapping, excellent allelic variants of many genes have been identified, such as crtrb <dig> for β-carotenoid synthesis in maize kernels  <cit> ; dwarf <dig> for maize flowering time  <cit> ; zmgw2-chr <dig> <cit>  and zmgs <dig> <cit> , which are related to maize kernel size and weight; tagw <dig>  which is associated with wheat kernel weight and maturity  <cit> ; and other genes related to starch synthesis in rice  <cit> .

contribution of cks to grain yield
plant hormones control many aspects of development, and like other hormones, cks affect many plant physiological and biochemical processes, including those controlling delayed senescence  <cit> , suppression of auxin-induced apical dominance  <cit> , signaling of nitrogen availability  <cit> , cell division and differentiation  <cit> , and sink strength  <cit> . ipt proteins, which are involved in synthesis of cks, are encoded by a multi-gene family in maize  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , petunia  <cit> , hop  <cit>  and pea  <cit> . a favorable ipt allele that resulted in increased grain weight has now been identified in maize using an association mapping approach .

ck content is co-regulated by two families of genes, including isopentenyl transferase and an oxidase/dehydrogenase in plants. in rice, reduced expression of osckx <dig>  which encodes the oxidase/dehydrogenase, caused an increase in grain number per panicle, due to ck accumulation in inflorescence meristems. osckx <dig> is expressed strongly in pistils, at an intermediate level in inflorescences and seeds, and at low levels in other organs  <cit> . tackx6-d <dig>  a wheat ortholog of rice osckx <dig>  was related to hgw by linkage mapping and association analysis. tackx6_d <dig> was expressed at a high level in seeds and pistils, but at a low level in other organs  <cit> . one study showed that zmipt <dig> is specifically expressed in pedicel, endosperm, and embryo, and plays a major role in ck biosynthesis for maize kernel development  <cit> . in this study, however, only snp <dig> was found to be significantly associated with knpr in one of the three experimental environments , and no associated snp was found for krn . cks coordinately induce extracellular invertase and hexose transporter activity, which are functionally coupled to supply carbohydrates to sink tissues  <cit> . in this study, a single nucleotide substitution from c to t in the zmipt <dig> coding region was significantly associated with kernel weight. this suggests that manipulation of ck metabolism in reproductive organs could be an effective approach to further increase crop grain yields, by increasing the flow of assimilates from source to sink, or by increasing sink capacity.

in vitro characterization of the zmipt <dig> enzyme showed that it prefers adp and atp over amp as substrates for dmapp ipt activity , consistent with the results of a previous study  <cit> . six amino acid substitutions, none of which were conservative, occurred in zmipt <dig>  compared with  <dig> other maize zmipts  <cit> , indicating that zmipt <dig>  and its specific expression pattern, is conserved and essential for kernel development. interestingly, the mutation associated with the favorable allele, zmipt2-t, was detected in the zmipt <dig> coding region, and found to result in a serine to proline substitution in the conserved ipt domain that caused the zmipt2-t enzyme to consume more atp, adp, and amp than the zmipt2-c enzyme . thus, selection for the molecular marker snp <dig> should improve yield by positively influencing maize kernel development via an increase in ipt enzyme activity.

nucleotide diversity in zmipt <dig> across six subgroups
in this study, the coding region of zmipt <dig> was sequenced across  <dig> chinese maize inbreds. the coding regions of functional genes tend to be relatively conserved, due to their specificity for and affinity with other types of molecules. thus, under natural selection, beneficial variants tend to become gradually fixed, while detrimental variants tend to be eliminated  <cit> . lower levels of diversity within the zmipt <dig> locus were estimated in subgroups pb and bsss, compared to the combined group  , suggesting either that the germplasm base remained remarkably narrow or that strong positive selection at that locus occurred in these subgroups. according to pedigrees,  <dig> inbreds in subgroup pb were mainly derived from us hybrid p <dig>  however, subgroup lan harbored the most diversity in the zmipt <dig> coding region across all these inbreds . this subgroup has been identified as having the most genetic diversity in one study using  <dig> ssr loci randomly distributed across the genome  <cit> .

selection for grain yield during the breeding process
it is hypothesized that natural selection favored smaller-seeded wild ancestors with a larger number of seeds per plant, earlier maturity, and wider geographic distribution  <cit> . however, high crop yield associated with larger grain size and weight has been the objective of artificial selection during most breeding programs. for example, the genes gs <dig>  <cit>  and gw5/sw <dig>  <cit>  have been proven to be involved in the evolution of grain size in rice. unlike rice, in wheat and maize, artificial selection is associated with an almost uniform increase in seed or grain size. the allele tagw2-6a hap-6a-a, which was associated with larger grain size, increased in frequency under positive selection from  <dig> % in the 1950s to current levels of  <dig> %  <cit> . under strong selection at a given locus, domestication has the potential to drastically increase ld and reduce diversity  <cit> .

estimates of the parameters π and tajima’s d in this study showed that artificial selection took place at the zmipt <dig> locus . however, only hap_ <dig>  among seven haplotypes examined here, harbored the zmipt2-t allele , and this favorable allele was associated with increased grain weight in two of the three experimental environments , suggesting positive selection for higher grain weight. similarly, a  <dig> % reduction in nucleotide diversity across the gs <dig> locus occurred among rice accessions carrying the a allele for gs <dig>  <cit> . the current study found that the zmipt2-t allele was not evenly distributed among these six maize subgroups, occurring with the highest frequency in subgroup pb, in which 81% of the tested lines harbor the favorable allele . the lowest tajima’s d value was also found for subgroup pb  indicating that distinct positive selection pressure has taken place at the zmipt <dig> locus in this subgroup. selection for the favorable allele zmipt2-t within each subgroup should be continued in order to improve maize yield.

CONCLUSIONS
a favorable allele, zmipt2-t, was associated with kernel weight in chinese maize germplasm. zmipt2-t was shown in vitro to have higher ipt activity than zmipt2-c with adp, atp, or amp as substrate. artificial selection at the zmipt <dig> locus was detected with tajima’s d tests across six subgroups of chinese maize germplasm, with the most frequent favorable allele identified in subgroup pb. this favorable allele could be used in molecular marker-assisted selection for improvement of grain yield components in chinese maize breeding programs.
