BACKGROUND
transcriptional and post-transcriptional events involve the interplay between protein effectors and nucleic acid targets, whose physical interaction is guided by sequence motifs and specific structural elements . motifs are usually defined as short nucleotide sequence patterns of length k  and represented with matrices containing the probabilities to find nucleotides in specific positions . in the past decade, the advancement of high-throughput technologies contributed to the generation of a large amount of genomic data  <cit> , promoting development of computational methods to detect regulatory elements such as transcription and splicing factor binding sites  <cit> . one fundamental requirement of methods for large-scale analysis is that relevant features  are identified with good accuracy and in reasonable time  <cit> . very importantly, algorithms should be as comprehensive as possible to provide insights into the nature of regulatory elements in their real genomic context, which requires analysis of different biological sets  <cit> .

as discussed by ma et al.
 <cit>  and weirauch et al.
 <cit> , there are several algorithms for de novo motif discovery, but only few are capable of performing a discriminative analysis  on high-throughput datasets:
● dreme  <cit>  restricts the search for sequence motifs to a simplified form of “regular expression”  words over the iupac alphabet, which consists of  <dig> wildcard characters in addition to the standard dna alphabet . to save computation time, dreme estimates the significance of re candidates by a heuristic search without scanning the whole input sequences  <cit> ;

● cmf   <cit>  is designed to discriminate between two sets of dna sequences through non-discrete pwms. the method takes into account false positive sites when updating pwms and related variables;

● decod   <cit>  uses k-mer counts. to compensate for errors introduced from ignoring the context of the k-mer, decod uses a deconvolution method that accounts for the higher rates of k-mers containing subsets of the true motif;

● xxmotif   <cit>  consists of i) a masking stage, where repeat regions, compositionally biased segments and homologous segment pairs are identified; ii) a pattern stage, where p-value enrichments are calculated for seed patterns using all 5-mers ; iii) and a pwm stage, where thousands of candidate pwms are merged.



despite the variety of motif discrimination approaches, knowledge of programming languages  <cit>  and acquaintance with web-based bioinformatics platforms  <cit>  often limit their use among non-specialists.

in this article, we introduce seamote, a web-server to perform de novo discriminative motif discovery in nucleic acid datasets. we present an approach that enables the exhaustive search of distinctive patterns in large sets of sequences, in a reasonable amount of computational time and with an easy-to-use user interface.

methods
seamote is based on the generation of a pool of nucleotide seeds followed by “zero or one occurrence per sequence”  model testing  <cit>  coupled with pattern extension and refinement  <cit> . seamote includes a number of unique features that make the algorithm simple to run and very accurate. the user can i) set a coverage threshold that is employed in the selection of enriched motifs in the positive set , ii) choose among multiple reference  set options and iii) include a redundancy removal step to increase the variability of discovered motifs. as shown in figure  <dig>  seamote workflow comprises a series of steps that can be summarized as follows: figure  <dig>

evaluation of the coverage of each pattern in the positive and reference sets;

determination of enriched  and differentially represented  motifs;

extension of selected seeds by adding a iupac letter in the k +  <dig> position;

re-iteration of steps 2- <dig> until the enrichement of at least one pattern remains above the coverage threshold in the positive set;

calculation of motif significance  and redundancy removal ;

generation of the positon weighted matrices and logo for each motif.



web-server usage
the seamote server presents a submission page that allows the upload of nucleic acid sequences and selection of parameters. default parameters  are defined according to best settings estimated using cross-validation . however, most of the parameters can be modified by the user, which adds flexibility to the web-service. detailed descriptions of the submission and output variables are provided in the on-line tutorial . at least one input set  should be provided for the analysis. currently, the number of sequences is limited to  <dig>  with a maximal length of  <dig> · <dig> nucleotides per sequence;

a reference set is required to estimate the significance of the discovered motifs. this can be: ● provided by the user , having the same size restrictions as the input set.

 ● automatically generated as a shuffle set, where the foreground set composition  and dimensions  are kept constant;

 ● automatically generated as a random set, where the foreground set dimensions are preserved but the internal composition is based on letter frequencies obtained from the human transcriptome/genome;



the coverage threshold  represents a parameter that the algorithm uses internally to select the most abundant motifs in the two datasets .



optionally, the user can assign a job name for each submission and request for an e-mail notification upon completion .

the output summary contains detailed information about the submission  as well as an interactive table . the latter item displays discovered motifs , logo representations and statistics used to estimate their significance: motif coverage for positive and reference sets, discrimination factor  and p-value  associated with each pattern. in addition, it is possible to retrieve the list of motifs tested , as well as their individual sequence logo  and positional weighted matrix  using the links provided in the output page .figure  <dig>

implementation
seamote operations are executed by c programs, whereas significance estimation, pattern filtering and sequence logo design are computed using r scripts and the biostrings, stringdist and seqlogo packages. the web-server is implemented in python, html and javascript, which provides a convenient framework for the pipeline control and the presentation of the output data. user-provided data are validated by python scripts and passed to the amazon web services , which manages the queue system, performs the redistribution of the work on our local machines and, once the job is completed successfully, forwards the user to the output page. depending on the size datasets and the server load, computations take from between 2– <dig> and 30– <dig> minutes .

datasets for motif finding
nucleic acids sequences were collected from chip-seq and clip-seq experiments available in the public domain  <cit> . chip-seq data comprises  <dig> encode datasets obtained from three groups, haib_tfbs by hudsonalpha , sydh_tfbs by yale and ucd , and uw_tfbs by university of washington . this collection covers  <dig> unique transcription factors  and more than  <dig> cell-types under different treatments. same number of low and high intensity peaks  was used to select negative and positive datasets, respectively  <cit> . clip-seq dataset contains  <dig> dorina  <cit>  datasets of  <dig> rna-binding proteins  . sequences with dorina scores in the top  <dig> percentile were considered as positives . for each positive set, we selected same amount of sequences in the bottom  <dig> percentile of dorina scores to build the negative set .

documentation
the documentation/tutorial of the seamote algorithm is available online, and it can be accessed using the links in the menu at the top of every server page. it contains a brief description of the method, a tutorial and information on the benchmark. additionally, the web interface in the output page provides help-notes  for table variables and download buttons. online documentation and “frequently asked questions”  sections updates will be provided on a regular basis according to method improvements and users’ inquiries,respectively.

RESULTS
identification of tf annotated motifs
to assess the performance of our method for discriminative motif discovery, we run seamote on a collection of  <dig> chip-seq datasets and compared our results with those obtained using other discriminative motif finders. specifically, we restricted the comparison to methods such as cmf, decod, dreme and xxmotif that can be run in batch on large sets of sequences. all methods were run on the same sets of foreground and background sequences under default settings. for each algorithm, we selected up to  <dig> top-scored motifs. to evaluate the ability of the different methods to recognise sequence patterns reported in literature, we collected tf motifs present in jaspar  <cit>  and jolma et al.
 <cit> . we then compared the pwms generated by cmf, decod, dreme, seamote and xxmotif with the motifs available in the reference databases. we considered successful the prediction in which the annotated motif was reported as tomtom  <cit>  match. figures 3a and 3b report the e-value  and q-value  obtained from the analyses with tomtom. as shown in figure 3c and table  <dig>  seamote succeeded in finding the consensus motifs in  <dig>  cases out of the  <dig> chip datasets with annotated motifs for the tfs. cmf found annotated motifs in  <dig> , decod in  <dig> , dreme in  <dig>  and xxmotif in  <dig>  cases . seamote was able to identify annotated motifs in  <dig> % of the cases even when considering only the top-ranked pwm .figure  <dig>

comparison of discriminative motif finder methods


for each algorithm, performances using tomtom  <cit>  and  <dig> to  <dig> top-ranked motifs are reported as number of successes  and as percentage over the complete chip-seq collection .

in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases , seamote identified motifs that are different from those reported in jaspar <cit>  and jolma et al.
 <cit>  databases. cmf and dreme identified different patterns in 74% and 67% of such cases , which suggests that this group of tfs might display diverse binding modes. indeed, with respect to the  <dig> successful hits, these motifs are predicted with significantly lower discrimination . thus, it is possible that the discrepancy with literature data arises from lower sequence specificity of the tfs, which makes the foreground and background sets more similar and, therefore, less informative. it should be also mentioned that the  <dig> misassigned cases correspond to  <dig> tfs, and for  <dig> of them seamote was able to correctly recognise the annotated binding pattern in at least one cell-type or specific treatment  <cit> . we also observe that some of the unassigned patterns can be correctly attributed to literature motifs if other comparison tools are employed instead of tomtom. in an additional calculation, we used matlign  <cit>  to compare the similarity between literature patterns and the top-ranked motif identified by seamote. in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, we found that seamote motifs have higher propensity to cluster with those of the same tf family  <cit> . intriguingly, we observe that in  <dig> out of the  <dig> cases  the top-ranked motif is associated with one pwm of an interacting tf, indicating that tf binding could be mediated by other proteins.

identification of rbp recognition motifs
to demonstrate the flexibility of our method for different types of nucleic acids, we assessed seamote ability to identify significantly enriched motifs in transcripts studied by clip-seq technology  <cit> . in each case analysed, we compared rnas bound to a specific protein  with same amount of unbound transcripts . since cmf does not allow the discriminative motif discovery on specific nucleic acid strand, we excluded the algorithm from the study and used the other tools for comparison. in our analysis  we noticed that seamote and dreme show best performances in finding discriminative motifs, followed by decod and xxmotif. this result was confirmed also in the analysis of rbp targets . indeed, seamote and dreme outperform decod and xxmotif in finding sequence patterns . compared to dreme, seamote achieves significantly higher discrimination , which is reflected in the ability to better separate foreground from background sets , and significance, denoted by lower p-values associated with each sequence pattern identified . in addition, seamote also shows very high sensitivity  and accuracy  . statistical measures of the performance are also reported for decod and xxmotif .figure  <dig> 
rna-binding protein motifs performance comparison. using  <dig> clip-seq experiments available in the public domain  <cit> , we compared decod  <cit> , dreme  <cit> , xxmotif  <cit>  and seamote performances. the ability to identify sequence elements that maximize the separation between positive and reference sets is reported for each motif identified using a) discrimination  and b) significance . cmf  <cit>  was excluded from the analysis because it does not allow motif discovery on a nucleic acid specific strand.

cross-validation of the clip-seq data
finally, we assessed seamote performances using a 3-fold cross-validation approach introduced by patel and stormo  <cit> : clip-seq sets of positive and negative sequences were randomly divided into three sets of similar sizes  and ; two of the three were combined to form a training set and the remaining one was used as test set. by this means, three training  and three test sets  were generated. we then compared the most significant motifs found in the training with those present in the test set using tomtom  <cit>  . seamote was able to correctly reproduce the most enriched motifs using training and testing sets, thus confirming the robustness of our approach .

CONCLUSIONS
algorithms for discriminative motif discovery are useful to identify regulatory elements in dna and rna sequences. comparisons between different sets provide relevant information to rationalize sequence determinants of physical interactions and can be exploited for future experimental design. in this work, we introduced the seamote algorithm for analysis of large-scale nucleic acid datasets. through an easy-to-use interface, the seamote web-server offers key features such as fast discrimination based on pattern occurrence, choice of multiple reference backgrounds  and identification of significant motifs in the whole span of tested pattern widths, which provides a range of practical solutions for analysis of experimental data. indeed, as reported in recent studies, inter-positional sequence patterns and variable binding sites information are key features to identify regulatory motifs and will be used in future computational developments  <cit> . we demonstrated the powerfulness of seamote for a large number of tf targets, correctly reproducing the results available in literature and showing better performances than other available tools. we also proved the flexibility and robustness of the algorithm by assessing its ability to identify enriched sequence patterns in clip experiments and using a three-fold cross-validation. we anticipate that the use of seamote and its integration into dna/rna-protein interaction predictors, such as catrapid  <cit> , would greatly enhance the ability to recognise physical associations.
