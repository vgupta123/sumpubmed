BACKGROUND
ocimum l., belonging to family lamiaceae is one of the best known genus for its medicinal properties and economically important aromatic oils. some ocimum species are also constituents of ayurvedic and indigenous medicines. this genus is highly variable and possesses wide range of intra- and inter-specific genetic diversity comprising at least 65
 <cit>  to more than  <dig> species
 <cit>  distributed all over the world. among these, ocimum sanctum l.  and ocimum basilicum l. are the two important species used extensively for their medicinal and industrial importance. o. sanctum, known as “the holy basil” is native to asian tropics
 <cit> , whereas o. basilicum l. or “the sweet basil” is described to be of african origin as per the germplasm resources information network
 <cit>  of united states department of agriculture. while holy basil is revered for its spiritual sanctity and medicinal potential
 <cit> , the sweet basil is widely used as culinary herb and for fragrance
 <cit> . both of the two ocimum species are rich reservoirs of innumerable phytochemicals, which comprises predominantly phenylpropanoids and terpenoids with various medicinal and aromatic properties. most of these phytochemicals are sequestered in specialized anatomical structures, termed glandular trichomes, on the surface of the aerial parts of the plants
 <cit> . o. sanctum is known to possess antibacterial, antianaphylactic, antihistaminic, wound healing, radioprotective, antidiabetic, larvicidal, anti-genotoxic, neuro-protective, cardio-protective and mast cell stabilization activity
 <cit> . the leaves and stem of holy basil contain a variety of biologically active constituents like saponins, flavonoids, triterpenoids, and tannins
 <cit> . urosolic acid  from o. sanctum l. is reported to have cardioprotective effect
 <cit> . some active phenolics like rosmarinic acid, apigenin, cirsimaritin, isothymusin and isothymonin exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities
 <cit> . the most important aroma components are described to be  <dig>   <dig> cineole, linalool, methyl chavicol  and to a lesser degree, eugenol
 <cit> . similarly, the essential oil of sweet basil  is described to be having antifungal, antimicrobial and insect-repelling activities
 <cit> . o. basilicum, contains primarily phenolic derivatives, such as eugenol, methyl eugenol, chavicol, estragole, and methyl cinnamate, often combined with various amounts of linalool
 <cit> . this is also reported to be clinically useful for prevention of stroke, and exhibiting anticarcinogenic, antituberculosis and hypoglycemic activities
 <cit> . thus, the uses of ocimum sp. for therapeutic purposes in addition to their industrial importance for aromatic properties reinforce the importance of ethno-botanical approach as a potential source of bioactive substances.

despite spiritual, pharmacological, and industrial importance, very little transcriptomic and genomic data of ocimum sp. is available limiting the studies on biosynthetic pathways of important phytochemicals
 <cit> . national center for biotechnology information  shows a record of  <dig> entries in nucleotide database and  <dig> est sequences of o. basilicum compared to only  <dig> entries in nucleotide database and  <dig> est sequences of o. sanctum. in recent years, several studies have successfully reported the generation of transcriptome data and its analysis as an effective tool to study gene expression in specific tissues at specific time, and also provide a platform to address comparative genomics for gene discovery in non-model plants for which no reference genome sequences are available
 <cit> . due to the availability of quick, low cost sequencing
 <cit>  and high quality annotation using different assembly tools
 <cit>  it has become possible to analyze and understand the genome of non model plant like ocimum. hence, o. sanctum and o. basilicum were selected for next generation sequencing  and analysis with the main objective to establish the basic understanding about genes involved in various pathways and the factors involved in the regulation and channelling of the secondary metabolites like phenylpropanoids and terpenoids. so, leaf transcriptome data of o. sanctum  and o. basilicum 
 <cit>  was generated using paired-end  illumina ngs sequencing platform and genes involved in phenylpropanoids/ terpenoids biosynthesis pathway were identified. this study also reports est collection of leaf tissues from o. sanctum and o. basilicum with a number of differentially expressed cytochrome p450s, transcription factors and pathway genes with probable involvement in differential metabolite biosynthesis in o. sanctum and o. basilicum leaf tissues. using these datasets, molecular markers of est-ssrs were also analyzed to facilitate the marker-assisted breeding of these species. overall, this data set will be a significant advancement in terms of genomic resources in the diverse ocimum genus.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing, de novoassembly and functional annotation of contigs
in recent years, illumina sequencing platform has been widely used for transcriptome analysis of plants devoid of reference genomes
. in order to generate transcriptome sequences, complementary dna  libraries prepared from leaf tissues of ocimum were sequenced using illumina hiseq <dig> platform. paired-end sequencing-by-synthesis  yielded raw data of  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  gb for o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively. after filtering and removing adapter sequences from the raw data,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads comprising of  <dig> and  <dig> high quality nucleotide bases for o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively, were retained for further assembly. filtered reads were assembled into contigs using velvet assembler at a hash length of  <dig>  which generated  <dig> and  <dig> contigs for o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively. transcript generation was carried out using oases- <dig> . <dig> for the same hash length that resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts for o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively. in both cases average contig lengths were of 1646 ±  <dig>  bp and 1363 ±  <dig>  bp with n <dig> values of  <dig> and  <dig> in o. sanctum and o. basilicum respectively . the average lengths of transcripts generated using illumina platform in curcuma longa, cabbage and goosegrass transcriptomes have also been reported with varied lengths of  <dig>  bp, 1419 bp and  <dig>  bp respectively
. the distribution of assembled transcript length ranged from  <dig> to > <dig> bases. maximum number of transcripts were of 501–1000 bp size with  <dig> transcripts  followed by  <dig> transcripts  of 1001–1500 bp size in o. sanctum. similarly in o. basilicum, 180–500 bp size transcripts were of highest in number  followed by  <dig> transcripts  of 501–1000 bp size. in both cases, least number of transcripts  <dig>  in o. sanctum and  <dig>  in o. basilicum were of 4501–5000 bp size . in root transcriptome of ipomoea batatas,  <dig> % unigenes were in the range of 101–500 bp length followed by  <dig> % of transcripts of 501–100 bp length
 <cit> , similarly in the case of medicago sativa, boehmeria nivea, apium graveolens and c. longa, centella asiatica the highest number of transcripts/unigenes were reported with length between 75–500 bp
. further, transcripts from both ocimum samples were clustered using cd-hit-v <dig> . <dig> at 95% identity and query coverage resulting in a total of  <dig> transcripts. blastx search was conducted for assembled sequences of o. sanctum and o. basilicum against uniprot databases and go terms were assigned for each unigene based on the go terms annotated to its corresponding homologue in the uniprot database with the proteins of arabidopsis, rice and lamiaceae family . in the case of o. sanctum,  <dig> transcripts  were annotated with arabidopsis,  <dig>  with rice and  <dig>  with lamiaceae family whereas  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  o. basilicum transcripts were annotated with arabidopsis, rice and lamiaceae family, respectively. about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transripts of o. sanctum; and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts in o. basilicum were uniquely annotated to lamiaceae, arabidopsis and rice databases, respectively . number of total transcripts annotated from all databases were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively.table  <dig>

functional classification of ocimumtranscriptome by go
gene ontology  is an international standardized gene functional classification system offering an updated and a strictly defined concept to comprehensively describe the properties of genes and gene products in any organism
 <cit> . in order to assign putative functions, transcripts from o. sanctum and o. basilicum were compared against the nr protein sequences of arabidopsis, rice and lamiaceae family available at uniprot database using blastx algorithm. the associated hits were searched for their respective go. based on sequence homology,  <dig> sequences from o. sanctum and  <dig> sequences from o. basilicum were categorized into  <dig> functional groups under three main categories: biological process , cellular component  and molecular function  . highest percentages of genes were classified under ‘unknown groups’ in all the three go catagories, followed by ‘binding activity’ , ‘membranes’ , ‘other biological processes’ , ‘nucleus’  and ‘hydrolase activity’  were observed. reports on salvia miltiorrhiza transcriptome, a member of the same family, also represents the ‘binding activity’ of the transcripts in mf category to be with maximum percentage with an anomaly in cc and bp categories
 <cit> . higher number of genes represented in ‘binding and hydrolase activity’ indicates dominance of gene regulation, signal transduction and enzymatically active processes. extremely low percentage of genes were classified in terms of ‘antioxidant’ , ‘transcriptional regulation activity’  and ‘localization’  categories . both the libraries showed similar type of distribution pattern of unigenes under different go terms. this study suggests the existence of huge potential for new gene identification, as a large number of unigenes from o. sanctum and o. basilicum were classified to ‘unknown’ subgroups of the three main categories.figure  <dig> 
histogram of gene ontology classification. the results are summarized in three main categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. bars represent assignments of o. basilicum and o. sanctum transcripts  with blast matches in the uniprot database  to each go term.



kegg analysis of ocimumtranscriptomes
to identify the biological pathways functional in the leaf tissues of o. sanctum and o. basilicum,  <dig> and  <dig> assembled transcripts from both species were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in kegg. all transcripts were classified mainly under five categories: metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and others. highest number of transcripts from both o. sanctum and o. basilicum were related to metabolism followed by others. in total, all transcripts from o. sanctum and o. basilicum were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . interestingly,  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, respectively, from o. sanctum and o. basilicum were found to be involved in biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites. the cluster for ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ’ and ‘terpenoid backbone biosynthesis ’ represented the largest group. as observed from figure 
 <dig>  the category of ‘terpenoid backbone biosynthesis’ showed highest percentage of transcripts compared to ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’ in o. sanctum  where as o. basilicum had highest percentage  of transcripts related to ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’. the list of chemicals and activities specifically in the leaf tissues of o. sanctum/tenuiflorum and o. basilicum as displayed in the dr. duke’s phytochemical and ethnobotanical database  also supported the higher percentage of terpenoids in o. sanctum and phenylpropanoids in o. basilicum. from the total compounds in duke’s database o. sanctum showed a higher percentage of diverse terpenoids  where as o. basilicum was found to be rich in phenylpropanoids .figure  <dig>

genes related to biosynthesis of different terpenoids and phenylpropanoids
o. sanctum and o. basilicum analyzed in this investigation accumulate different types of phenylpropanoids/terpenoids in the essential oil. o. sanctum contains mainly eugenol , β-elemene  and β-caryophyllene 
 <cit>  whereas o. basilicum accumulates methylchavicol  and linalool 
 <cit> . precursor molecules for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are derived from the shikimate pathway  while terpenoid biosynthesis utilizes isoprenoid precursors from cytosolic mva  as well as plastidial mep pathways  
 <cit> . uniprot annotations against lamiaceae family were used to identify genes encoding enzymes involved in different steps of phenylpropanoid and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. both o. sanctum and o. basilicum annotations comprised of all most all the genes involved in the biosynthesis of essential oil specific phenylproanoids and terpenoids indicating the completeness of transcriptome data . higher number of transcripts for 4cl , adh , tat  from phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and dxs , gpps , and tps  were detected for terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. the multiplicity of terpenoids produced by a single plant is achieved both by the expression of multiple tps genes and by the ability of some tpss to catalyze the production of multiple products
 <cit> . evidently, annotation of transcriptome data from both ocimum species against arabidopsis and lamiaceae family in uniprot revealed several candidates of probable terpene synthases involved in biosynthesis of terpenoids like- menthofuran, geraniol, limonene, linalool, kaurene, cadinene, selinene, germacrene-d and zingiberene .figure  <dig>

recently, presence of pentacyclic triterpenoids like ursolic, oleanolic and betulinic acids has been reported in ocimum spp.
 <cit> . this non-aromatic class of compounds have pharmacological importance such as anti-hiv, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities
 <cit> . like other sesquiterpenoids these triterpenoids also share their origin to farnesyl diphosphate . fdp is converted to squalene and then to oxidosqualene respectively by squalene synthase  and squalene epoxidase  enzymes. subsequently, oxidosqualene in presence of multifunctional oxidosqualene cyclases  viz.α-amyrin synthase , β-amyrin synthase  or lupeol synthase  which are then converted to α-amyrin, β-amyrin or lupeol, respectively. oscs catalyzing the formation of α-amyrin, also produce β-amyrin, finally synthesizing diverse triterpenoids with the help of cypp450s members. hence, the bas expression cannot be directly correlated with the triterpene accumulation. similar reports of triterpenoids biosynthesis from these oscs are available from catharanthus roseus and o. basilicum
 <cit> . in this investigation a total of  <dig> transcripts from o. basilicum and  <dig> transcripts from o. sanctum were homologous to β-amyrin synthase as per the arabidopsis annotation. hplc analysis from the dried leaves of both the ocimum species detected oleanolic and ursolic acids however betulinic acid remained undetected. o. sanctum was observed to be having higher content of oleanolic and ursolic acids as compared to o. basilicum .figure  <dig>

ocimum spp. is also known to accumulate rosmarinic acid , which has various pharmacological properties including antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities
 <cit> . both transcriptomes contained several  transcripts annotated as rosmarinic acid synthase with average rpkm values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. to validate differential digital gene expression,  <dig> genes were randomly selected for quantitative real time pcr . these genes  showed up-regulation in o. basilicum compared to o. sanctum . all the genes described in this investigation shows up-regulation for o. basilicum in digital gene expression results . this indicates higher accumulation of metabolites in o. basilicum compared to o. sanctum which is in coherence with the cytological study . as also discussed earlier, o. basilicum is rich in phenylpropanoids with higher content and array of related compounds, which is also in coherence with the observation on upregulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes like pal, ccr, cs3′h, egs, cvomt and hppr in o. basilicum.

discovery of candidate cyp450s and transcription factors with probable involvement in phenylpropanoid/terpenoid biosynthesis
cytochrome p450s  are reported to be nature’s most versatile biological catalysts forming the biggest gene families in plants accounting for more than 1% of the total gene annotations in individual plant species
 <cit> . these are generally involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids, sterols, lignins, hormones, fatty acids, pigments, and phytoalexins in plants
 <cit> . these genes are also the subject of analysis in many of the de novo transcriptome sequencing projects in an effort to unravel novel functions of cyps
 <cit> . through uniprot annotation against arabidopsis, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were identified from o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively resembling cyps. however, against lamiaceae family annotation, only  <dig> transcripts from o. sanctum and  <dig> from o. basilicum were identified as members of cyp <dig> gene family. out of total arabidopsis database annotated transcripts,  <dig> transcripts were exclusively annotated to o. sanctum and  <dig> transcripts to o. basilicum, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were found unique to o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively in case of the lamiaceae annotations. apart from the total and exclusive transcripts,  <dig> transcripts from o. sanctum and  <dig> transcripts in o. basilicum were annotated against both arabidopsis and lamiaceae family in uniprot. all the cyp450s involved in the secondary metabolism were classified under  <dig> gene families viz. cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  with diverse functions in phenylpropanoids and terpenoid metabolism. among all the cyp families classified, the maximum number of transcripts in both the ocimum sp. belonged to cyp <dig> family with most abundant cyp71a <dig> transcripts. recently, the role of genes of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families were worked out and described to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis
 <cit> . additionally, transcripts of cyp716a class were also identified to be the members of multifunctional oxidases involved in triterpenoids  biosynthesis

cyp transcripts of o. sanctum



transcription factors  are sequence specific dna-binding proteins interacting with the promoter regions of target genes to modulate their expression. in plants, these proteins play a very important role in regulation of plant development, reproduction, intercellular signalling, response to environment, cell cycle and are also important in the modulation of secondary metabolites biosynthesis
 <cit> . in recent years, many studies have been reported on the involvement of various tf families like bhlh, bzip, zinc fingers, myb, arf, hsf, wrky, hb and nac in regulation of secondary metabolites and plant stress responses
 <cit> . as phenylpropanoids and terpenoids are the main determinants of aroma and flavour in ocimum, it becomes important to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved their biosynthesis, which can further be used to modulate the pathway and develop phenylpropanoid or terpenoid enriched chemotypes. a few transcription factors from other plants, eg. emission of benzenoids i , emission of benzenoids ii , and odorant  <dig> , myb <dig>  members of r2r3-myb family regulate benzenoid/phenylpropanoid volatile biosynthesis in petunia hybrida
 <cit> . orca <dig> and ap <dig> family member, myc <dig>  a bhlh family member and wrky <dig> regulate indole alkaloid and terpenoid biosynthesis pathway in catharanthus roseus
 <cit> . similarly, a wound inducible wrky transcription factor from papaver somniferum was suggested to be involved in benzylisoquinoline biosynthetic pathway
 <cit> . also, in lamiaceae family plants like salvia miltiorrhiza and perilla frutescens, tfs belonging to bhlh family are reported to be involved in phenypropanoid biosynthesis pathway
 <cit> . in the present investigation tfs were classified according to uniprot annotation for arabidopsis family. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in o. sanctum and o. basilicum, respectively were grouped into  <dig> tf families . those which were annotated to have sequence specific transcription factor activity but cannot be grouped among any family were included in ‘other’ tfs category, following arabidopsis transcription factor database  and plant transcription factor database 
 <cit>  classification. a systematic analysis of these transcription factors would help in understanding differential regulation of terpenoid and phenypropanoid pathways.figure  <dig>

cytogenetic characterization of o. sanctumand o. basilicum
there have been discrepancies regarding the chromosome number of ocimum in literature. darlington and wylie
 <cit>  and mehra and gill
 <cit>  considered x =  <dig> as basic chromosome number for the genus ocimum as a whole, while some other authors suggested that ocimum species are characterized by the different basic chromosome numbers x =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 16
 <cit> . in order to establish the actual chromosome numbers for the two varieties used in this study, fast growing roots emerging from stem cuttings were examined for somatic chromosome number. observations recorded from root-tip mitosis reveal somatic chromosome count of 2n =  <dig> for o. sanctum and 2n =  <dig> for o. basilicum and chromosome size below 1 μm . as the essential oil of the genus ocimum is the reservoir of secondary metabolites, there may be a probable correlation between the chromosome numbers of species and its essential oil yield, which may in turn be affected by expression of related genes. indeed, dge and real-time expression analyses showed higher expression of pathway genes in o. basilicum compared to o. sanctum . moreover, the ploidy level has been shown to enhance the accumulation of secondary metabolites in cymbopogon
 <cit> . as reported earlier, o. basilicum  shows more vigorous growth and higher oil content  compared to o. sanctum  with  <dig> % oil content
 <cit> .

analysis of gc content and identification of ssr markers
next generation sequencing also offers an opportunity for the analysis of gc content among transcripts and expands the scope for molecular markers such as ssrs. gc content is an important indicator of the genomic composition including evolution, gene structure , gene regulation and stability of dna
 <cit> . average gc contents of o. sanctum and o. basilicum transcripts were analyzed to be  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively , which is in the range of gc levels of coding sequences in dicots 
 <cit> . simple sequence repeats  markers have proven to be valuable tools for various applications in genetics and breeding for the better understanding of genetic variation. as described, more than  <dig> species
 <cit>  of ocimum are reported around the world and hence, polymorphic ssr markers are important for investigations related to genetic diversity, relatedness, evolution, linkage mapping, comparative genomics and gene-based association studies. transcriptome ssr markers also exhibit high inter-specific transferability
 <cit> . genus ocimum is highly prone to cross pollination and hence the seed raised population will have variability in metabolite content
 <cit> . the identification of ssrs in ocimum sp. will help in distinguishing closely related individuals and will also provide useful criteria for enriching and analyzing variation in the gene pool of both the plants. even though snps serve as excellent markers especially for high-throughput mapping and studying complex genetic traits, ssrs provide a number of advantages over other marker systems. ssrs with their moderate density still serve as the best co-dominant marker system for construction of framework linkage maps
 <cit> . the transcripts from the data of present investigation were also found to have abundant ssrs. out of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts of o. sanctum and o. basilicum,  <dig> % transcripts  from o. sanctum and  <dig> %  transcripts from o. basilicum were observed to be having ssrs . the total number of ssr containing sequences in o. sanctum and o. basilicum were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. following the criteria used to identify these ssrs, di-nucleotide repeats were highest in number for both the species , while penta-nucleotide repeats were of lowest occurrence  in o. sanctum and hexa-nucleotide repeats  in o. basilicum. the most prevalent dinucleotide ssrs group had the highest occurrence of ct, tc, ag and ga repeats followed by trinucleotide  ssrs in o. sanctum, while in o. basilicum tc, ct, ag and ga dinucleotide repeats were highest. interestingly, several ssr motifs were linked with unique sequences encoding enzymes  involved in terpenoid/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . maximum number of ssrs was observed in 4cl transcripts of o. sanctum where as ssr number was abundant in ans transcripts of o. basilicum. the gene specific identification of ssrs in both the ocimum sp. will help in distinguishing closely related individuals and will also provide useful criteria for enriching and analyzing variation in the gene pool of the plant. similarly, mining of snps from ngs-generated transcripts mainly involves clustering and assembling the sequence reads, followed by snp identification by means of in silico approaches
 <cit> . in this investigation, a total of  <dig>  transitions and  <dig>  transversions were observed by the snp finder tool with o. sanctum as anchor .table  <dig>

terpenoids and phenylpropanoids are the predominant secondary metabolites in ocimum species. these metabolites are synthesized through metabolic divergence from the mevalonate/non-mevalonate and shikimate pathways, respectively, and accumulate in the specialized glandular trichomes on the leaves
 <cit> . so, this study was undertaken with the objective of enriching the existing limited set of genomic resources in ocimum, and to provide a comparative analysis of transcriptomes of two ocimum species having contrasting essential oil composition. to this end, high quality transcriptome database was established for o. sanctum and o. basilicum by using ngs technology. this is the first report of a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of ocimum species. genes encoding pathway enzymes related to aromatic components such as volatile terpenoids, phenylpropanoids and non-volatile medicinal compounds such as pentacyclic triterpenes and rosmarinic acid were identified in the transcriptome database; indicating the importance of exploring ocimum species as a source of both medicinal and aromatic compounds. moreover, several putative cyps and transcription factors with probable involvement in the biosynthesis and regulation of terpenoids and phenylpropanoids were identified. further investigations on these putative cyps and tfs may reveal the reasons behind differential accumulation of phenylpropanoids/terpenoids, along with the similarity/difference in biosynthetic pathways operating in different species of ocimum. additionally, several snps and ssrs were identified in both the transcriptomes which will assist in breeding of ocimum for developing distinct chemotypes. overall, ocimum transcriptome databases presented here, both individually and collectively, can be exploited to characterize genes related to phenylproanoid and terpenoid metabolism and their regulation, as well as for breeding chemotypes with unique essential oil composition in this largely cross-pollinating species.
