BACKGROUND
the basement membrane  is a thin layer of extracellular matrix  of which one of the major components is laminin . laminins are a large family of heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of at least  <dig> isoforms that play many roles in cell function, including cell adhesion and migration. ln- <dig>  is a major isoform found in epithelial bms  <cit> .

attachment of the epithelial cell to the underlying bm is mediated through hemidesmosomes . the transmembrane integrin α6β <dig> links the epithelial cell to ln- <dig> in the bm while the bullous pempigoid antigen  <dig>  also plays a role in cell attachment. the cytoplasmic proteins plectin and the bullous pemphigoid antigen  <dig>  connect the cytokeratin intermediate filament skeleton to the hd complex  <cit> .

extracellular matrix proteins are affected in diseases of multiple species. recently, a mutation in the ln- <dig> γ <dig> subunit in some belgian horse foals has found to result in blistering of the skin, mouth epithelia and loss of the hooves  <cit> . a variety of human genetic and autoimmune bullous diseases also exist. epidermolysis bullosa  is a group of diseases resulting in blistering in the bm and skin fragility in which ln- <dig>  plectin, integrin α <dig>  bp <dig> or collagen type vii may be affected  <cit> . as well, the bullous pemphigoid group of diseases characterized by subepidermal blistering and dysadhesion of epithelial cells, occur due to the presence of circulating antibodies against ln- <dig> or bp <dig>  <cit> . both lamellar bm and hemidesmosomal components are degraded during laminitis, a disease of the equine hoof with separation of the basal epithelial cell from the underlying bm along with degradation of the bm laminins and collagens  <cit> .

isolation and culture of keratinocytes from a variety of species has been described including human  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . these methods have become well established through the development of specialized serum free media formulations, selective culture and substrate modifications which allow for successful routine cultivation of keratinocytes  <cit> . however, methods and specialized culture procedures for isolation and prolonged culture of equine keratinocytes, specifically from hoof lamellae, are less than optimal  <cit> . such culturing of equine keratinocytes would provide a beneficial research tool for the in vitro study of laminitis and other epithelial related diseases in the horse. we modified tissue isolation and culture techniques to produce a method suitable for equine keratinocytes. additionally, the in vitro production and processing of ln- <dig> as well as production of other extracellular matrix proteins by equine keratinocytes were studied.

RESULTS
cell isolation and optimization of culture conditions
skin keratinocytes isolated from lip epithelium were able to propagate on collagen type i coated substrate in dmem supplemented with 5% fbs,  <dig> ng/ml egf,  <dig> μg/ml bpe,  <dig>  ug/ml hydrocortisone and  <dig> μg/ml insulin, at a calcium concentration of approximately  <dig>  mm. cells reached confluence in  <dig> ±  <dig>  days  and were sub cultured to passage  <dig> without significant loss of cell character.

initial studies found lamellar keratinocytes to reach  <dig> - 80% confluence under conditions optimal for skin keratinocytes, in a mean of  <dig>  days ±  <dig>  , however cells were large, and unable to attach and proliferate upon sub-culture . a variety of other media conditions, in which calcium concentration was modified, were used to optimize growth for hoof lamellar cells. calcium free dmem media with supplementation with 5% fbs plus calcium  proved optimal from a variety of media compositions tested for lamellar propagation to passage  <dig> on collagen type i substrates  resulting in homogenous populations of small cobblestone shaped proliferative cells . initial culture in lower calcium concentrations did not prove suitable for cell survival or proliferation upon sub culture. additionally, equine keratinocytes were not able to grow or grew poorly in keratinocyte serum free media  with serum supplementation, a media designed for isolation of human and mouse keratinocytes .

cell characterization
equine keratinocytes demonstrated cobblestone cell morphology  with few or no spindle shaped cells characteristic of fibroblasts. expression of cytokeratins by both immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis was demonstrated . hela cells served as a positive control, while equine fibroblasts served as a negative control . the intermediate filament vimentin was expressed by only a few skin keratinocytes in these cultures while all lamellar cells expressed vimentin in the cell cytoplasm regardless of the calcium concentration of the growth medium .

characterization of equine extracellular matrix components
ln- <dig> synthesized by equine keratinocytes was demonstrated by intracellular fluorescence of individual cells and small cell clusters  while confluent monolayers show primarily intercellular staining . likewise, individual ln- <dig> subunits demonstrated intracellular staining in both skin and lamellar keratinocytes . equine fibroblasts did not show any significant expression of ln- <dig> and thus confirm antibody specificity . immunoblotting analysis of individual cell and matrix layers and culture media demonstrated all three ln- <dig> subunits are produced by equine keratinocytes intracellularly, and are deposited into the underlying matrix and secreted into the culture media . the cell-associated form of the γ <dig> subunit corresponds to the full length 150-kda subunit, while in both the deposited matrix layer and culture media an additional 105-kda γ2' processed form was present. in all cell fractions, a 140-kda band corresponding to the β <dig> subunit was present with no processed forms observed. the 190-kda precursor α <dig> form and the processed 165-kda α <dig> subunit forms were found in preparations of the deposited matrix. in conditioned media, the 165-kda processed α <dig> subunit and a further processed form of 145-kda was observed . confocal microscopy of cell monolayers demonstrated that ln- <dig> is located primarily in the basal layer of confluent cells while little is observed on the apical or lateral layers .

by immunfluorescence microscopy, integrin α <dig> was localized in the cytoplasm of subconfluent cells  while in confluent cell monolayers staining was located intercellularly in a pattern identical to ln- <dig> . hemidesmosome proteins, bp <dig>  bp <dig> and plectin demonstrated a cytoplasmic punctate distribution in skin keratinocytes , while in lamellar keratinocytes, a granular linear pattern was observed . equine fibroblasts demonstrated either no observable staining or faint diffuse background staining .

discussion
cultivation of primary cells is an essential technique for the in vitro study of a wide variety of cell types from many species. similar to another report  <cit> , skin keratinocytes isolated from lip epithelium were found to proliferate and propagate in culture. in the present study, cells were found to adhere well to collagen type i during the initial isolation and this substrate was used for initial growth in addition to subculture. skin keratinocytes grew well in standard dmem culture media with hormonal and serum supplementation and an approximate calcium concentration of  <dig>  mm. this is in contrast to dahm et al  <cit>  who found media containing a calcium concentration of  <dig>  mm optimal in their study, as with higher calcium they found early differentiation and loss of cell proliferation. work presented here indicates that skin keratinocytes are able to proliferate at a higher calcium concentration, as long as suitable media and substrate conditions are present.

initial studies to grow and passage hoof lamellar keratinocytes under conditions optimal for skin keratinocytes proved only minimally successful, possibly due to loss of cell proliferative capacity. calcium concentration present in culture medium is known to play a major role in cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . for equine skin keratinocytes, a calcium concentration of  <dig>  mm was found to be optimal for cell proliferation and propagation  <cit> . likewise, for lamellar keratinocytes, growth in calcium free dmem media supplemented with 5% fbs plus additional calcium  proved optimal for prolonged lamellar cell propagation. these results show variation in the calcium requirements of keratinocytes from different tissues in the same species, as well as determining requirements for prolonged culture of primary equine lamellar keratinocytes.

as the epithelial and dermal lamellae are interlocked, easy separation of the two tissue types proves difficult and prevention of fibroblast overgrowth while maintaining keratinocyte proliferation proves difficult. physical separation of the epithelial lamellae from the dermal lamellae using a modified hoof wall removal method resulted in little fibroblast contamination of cultures in our study, thus providing a simple method to isolate relatively pure populations of keratinocytes. the use of the protease dispase ii during the isolation of skin keratinocytes, which separates epithelial tissue from the dermal tissue, also decreases fibroblast contamination  <cit> . an explant model of growth of bovine hoof keratinocytes at 37°c has been described, however without separation of the epidermal lamellae from the dermal tissue, cultures obtained were mixed and consisted predominately of fibroblasts with continued propagation  <cit> . thus, the techniques used in our study provide simple methods to obtain relatively pure cultures of equine keratinocytes. the use of culture medium supplemented with a lower serum concentration of 5%, rather than standard 10%, was also used in an attempt to decrease fibroblast growth by minimizing serum derived factors which tend to stimulate fibroblast growth and inhibit epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . other culture medium additives including insulin  <cit> , egf  <cit> , hydrocortisone  <cit>  and bovine pituitary extract  <cit>  have all been found to stimulate epithelial cell proliferation and appear to increase the growth of equine keratinocytes.

similar to keratinocytes from other species, equine keratinocytes show characteristic cell morphology and express cytokeratins, the primary intermediate filament marker of the epithelial cell type. along with filamentous cytoplasmic localization in cells by immunofluorescence, immunoreactive proteins between 46-kda to 63-kda were observed in cell lysates using an antibody recognizing acidic and basic cytokeratins similar to a study using equine lamellar tissue  <cit>  as well as in hela cell lysates  <cit> . the intermediate filament vimentin was expressed by only a few skin cells in cultures and likely represented small numbers of contaminating fibroblasts confirmed by their elongated spindle shape morphology . vimentin has previously been thought of as a marker of cells of mesenchymal origin only, however human cultured keratinocytes have been demonstrated to express vimentin in low calcium conditions, yet when grown in higher calcium only cells located at the periphery of the cell outgrowth expressed vimentin  <cit> . we found all lamellar cells expressed vimentin in the cell cytoplasm regardless of the calcium concentration and did not display a fibroblastic cell morphology. additionally, vimentin expression may be cell origin specific, as equine skin keratinocytes have been found to not express vimentin in culture  <cit>  while lamellar keratinocytes in culture have been shown to express vimentin  <cit>  in agreement with findings in this work.

ln- <dig> plays a major role in attachment of the epithelial cell to the substratum through the interaction of the α <dig> subunit with integrin α6β <dig> as well as interaction between the β <dig> subunit with collagen and other laminin isoforms in the bm  <cit> . however, expression and processing of laminin isoforms in equine keratinocytes has not been studied extensively. ln- <dig> expression in vivo has been demonstrated in the equine hoof  <cit>  and skin  <cit>  localized to the bm. this study has confirmed that equine skin and hoof keratinocytes cells produce ln- <dig> in vitro.

ln- <dig> is synthesized intracellularly to form a α3β3γ <dig> heterotrimer and following secretion from the cell and incorporation into the ecm, the human γ <dig> subunit is converted from 150-kda to 105-kda while the α <dig> subunit is converted from 190-kda to 165-kda  <cit> . this study confirms that equine ln- <dig> subunits are synthesized and processed in a similar manner. overall, skin and lamellar keratinocytes showed similar ln- <dig> expression and processing confirming that the same events occur regardless of the tissue of origin.

integrin α <dig> showed the same expression pattern similar to ln- <dig> localization in equine cells. this would be expected as ln- <dig> binds to integrin α <dig> to provide cell attachment and corresponds to what is seen in other cell types  <cit> . expression of the hemidesmosome proteins bp <dig>  bp <dig> and plectin in skin keratinocytes showed a cytoplasmic punctate distribution similar to other species  <cit> . alternatively, granular linear staining patterns of localization have also been observed for these proteins in some cell lines  <cit>  including lamellar keratinocytes. the reasons for this difference between cell origin are unclear, however as bp <dig> and plectin function to interact with the cytoskeleton, localization similar to intermediate filaments is not unexpected.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have refined methods for prolonged culture and subculture of equine keratinocytes and have provided evidence that both skin and hoof lamellar keratinocytes produce ln- <dig> and hemidesmosome proteins in vitro. expression and processing patterns are similar to their counterparts from other species and not only provides a basis for further study but also extends knowledge in the field of matrix research. the methods developed in this study will allow for easier analysis and more manageable models of cell types and factors involved in equine diseases as well as provide a starting point for the development of a physiological in vitro model system of the unique equine lamellar structure.
