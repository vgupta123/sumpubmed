BACKGROUND
functionally important small rnas were first described in nematodes in  <dig>  <cit> . however, it was not until  <dig> that researchers began to understand the function of this family of rnas that includes microrna  and to recognize that their significance was not confined to lower order organisms  <cit> . the small rna classified as mir are short sequences, 18â€“ <dig> nucleotide long, encoded by nuclear genes that produce characteristic stem-loop rna structures when transcribed. during processing from the primary transcript, the mature mir sequence is loaded into an rna:protein complex known as the "rna induced silencing complex"   <cit> . the sequence of the mir loaded in the complex targets the risc to specific binding sites in the 3' untranslated region of mrna transcripts, resulting in either degradation of the mir:mrna complex or translocation to processing bodies. in either case, association of risc with mrna causes decreased translation of the targeted gene product  <cit> . as a result of decreased translation of their cognate targets, mir have been reported to guide developmental decisions including cell fate, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, adipocyte differentiation, and processes that alter muscle development and growth including myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy  <cit> .

the objective of the current research was to evaluate mir transcriptome profiles during skeletal muscle development in swine. microrna were initially reported to have a role in skeletal muscle development utilizing mouse, drosophila, and zebrafish models. three muscle-specific mirna  were identified to increase in abundance during muscle cell differentiation  <cit> . however, these mirna have been reported to regulate different stages of myogenesis  <cit> . mir- <dig> increases proliferation of c2c <dig> myoblasts, whereas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> promote differentiation  <cit> . research in livestock models has begun to evaluate the role these mirna have in skeletal muscle development. expression of the muscle regulatory factor, myogenic factor  <dig>  has been reported to regulate mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> transcription level in a chicken cell culture model  <cit> . in addition, over-expression of fibroblast growth factor- <dig> has been reported to decrease mir- <dig> abundance, resulting in developmental changes in the somite of developing chicken embryos  <cit> . muscle-specific mir have also been reported to regulate a gene that directly impacts economic traits in livestock  <cit> . a mutation in the myostatin gene of heavily muscled belgian texel sheep creates a target site for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> containing risc complexes in the 3' untranslated portion of the transcript, resulting in decreased translation of the myostatin protein and consequent increase in muscle mass.

with the dramatic increase in identified mir sequences for multiple species including livestock species, a public database dedicated to the cataloguing of predicted and experimentally observed mirs has been developed   <cit> . in human,  <dig> mirs have been described . however, genomic sequence scans and mir cloning results indicate that the actual total number of human mirs may be closer to  <dig>  <cit> . comparative analysis of these sequences indicates that they are highly conserved among species as diverse as nematodes and mammals, supporting the hypothesis that they are of central importance to biological processes. in addition, expression of mir genes is tightly regulated spatially among tissues and temporally within tissues during development in all species studied, indicating the importance of determining mir transcriptome profiles to fully understand their biological importance  <cit> . in order to identify mir and determine their role in skeletal muscle of livestock, we evaluated mir transcriptome profiles at specific stages of muscle development including proliferating satellite cells, three stages of fetal growth, day-old neonate, and the adult.

RESULTS
validation of mir cdna libraries
the method of mir identification and quantification by cloning and sequencing has been utilized in numerous reports of mir biology  <cit> . it is particularly advantageous to use this method when working in species with poorly characterized genomes, since variation in mir sequences between species has become apparent  <cit> .

our initial goal was to obtain complete transcriptome profiles of mir abundance in skeletal muscle, and to accurately measure changes in the level of abundance for these mir between developmental stages. time points evaluated included proliferating satellite cells , three stages of fetal development , day-old neonate, and adult. after identification of mir, accurate quantification of changes in mir abundance level between libraries and stages of skeletal muscle development was imperative. for all species, the dynamic range and precision obtained with enumerating each sequence observed enables a more quantitative description of mir abundance levels. converting this precision to accuracy, requires running enough samples to saturate the signal until the abundance levels stay constant as new sequences are added. initially, data from the neonatal muscle profiles were used to determine mir signal saturation as an indicator that abundance level of mir would remain constant as additional data were added . although the number of unique singletons was far from exhausted after  <dig>  observed putative mir, the number of new sequences observed for known and unknown mir began to plateau, suggesting that the singletons were either rare mir, represent contamination of the tissue with trace amounts of other tissues, or are sequence artifacts. therefore, the data sets consisting of several thousand mir sequences were determined to be extensive enough to capture the diversity of mir abundance and estimate relative steady state levels in the developmental stages examined. similar plots  were created from proliferating satellite cell profiles of the 4th and 5th passage. as with the neonate, abundance levels of known and unknown mir were well defined once a few thousand mir had been sequenced, as estimated abundance levels based on the first  <dig>  sequenced clones from the 4th and 5th passage satellite cells agreed with estimates for the full library of  <dig>  clones within 10%. together, these results provide confidence that the number of clones sequenced provide an accurate representation of the mir transcriptome profiles of porcine skeletal muscle.

comparison of mir expression profiles between libraries created from independent samples at the same developmental state was of interest to examine biological and technical replication of the clone-based approach to mir profiling. previous studies in other species have not specifically addressed this issue. therefore, two approaches were completed to evaluate possible variation between mir libraries. first, transcriptome profiles were compared between mir libraries that were replicated in the current experiment including the three proliferating satellite cell, two adult biceps femoris, and two d  <dig> fetal biceps femoris libraries . as detailed in the methods, rna was obtained from multiple cell culture isolations of proliferating satellite cells at different cell passages including 4th, 5th, and 6th passages. the 4th and 5th passages were pooled together and compared to two different cell culture isolations from the 6th passage cells. the mir trascriptome profiles from the two 6th passage samples differed from each other as much as from the 4th and 5th passage sample . therefore, variability in abundance was quantified using a histogram  of relative changes in abundance. data utilized in the histogram was restricted to mir observed at a minimum abundance ratio level of  <dig> per thousand mir observed. this analysis resulted in  <dig> observed changes between samples that were not expected to have differing transcriptome profiles. of these observed changes, the majority of changes were small . however, four ratios  were between  <dig> and  <dig> per thousand mir expressed, with one almost reaching a ratio of  <dig>  as a result of this analysis, we concluded that changes in abundance are likely to be significant if they are greater than 6-fold. upon final evaluation of the mir transcriptome profiles, we took a more conservative approach and restricted our discussion to changes in mir abundance levels that were 10-fold or greater. second, two individual libraries from the same 6th passage rna ligation template were created to determine if variability was introduced during the pcr amplification step . the transcriptome profiles of the replicate libraries were identical , suggesting that variation observed previously between the three satellite cell libraries was due to satellite cell populations.

further evaluation of mir tags from the adult biceps femoris libraries  demonstrated reproducible abundance levels between libraries of the moderate to highly abundant mir including let- <dig> and the muscle-specific mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  however, clear differences between the two libraries were evident as seven additional mir were identified in the first library compared to the second. in contrast to the adult and satellite cell mir libraries, the fetal libraries exhibited similarity across all mir that were present . this observed variation in mir abundance within the adult libraries versus the fetal libraries could be attributed to animal variation. for the fetal libraries, biceps femoris of four female fetuses was collected and pooled for rna extraction separately from two individual sows. the pooling strategy necessary to obtain sufficient starting material for the fetal muscle samples may have reduced variation present between individual samples and present a less variable overall mir profile. in contrast, each adult library was created from a muscle sample of an individual sow. additionally, difference between libraries could be a result of variation in muscle sample. muscle is not a homogeneous tissue  <cit> , and it has been reported that gene abundance levels change based on location of the sample and distribution of type i and type ii muscle fibers throughout the sample  <cit> . for the fetal libraries, the entire biceps femoris was obtained from four fetuses. the pooled sample was then powdered to a homogenous mix for rna extraction. however, for the adult libraries a two to four gram sample was obtained for rna extraction due to the greater size of the adult muscle. therefore, it is possible that the two biceps femoris samples for the adult libraries were heterogeneous and may have contributed to the variation in mir tags between adult libraries.

microrna transcriptome profiles in skeletal muscle
a digital transcriptome profile approach  <cit>  was applied to evaluate mir abundance based on cloning the mir population from each sample and evaluating abundance as the number of transcripts for a given mir gene per thousand transcripts observed . this cloning and sequencing-based approach was highly successful, as indicated by the high degree of homology between our results and those previously described in mirbase for other species.

sequence comparison to known mir identified the muscle-specific mir- <dig> as the highest abundant mir across all muscle samples, which represented greater than 60% of all mir present . this contrasts sharply with the abundance of mir- <dig> in proliferating satellite cells at  <dig>  per thousand . in mouse c2c <dig> cells, mir- <dig> is also lowly abundant in proliferating cells and has been reported to be induced during differentiation  <cit> , suggesting that its presence is associated with the switch from precursor to mature muscle cell. in addition, mr- <dig> and mir- <dig> are lowly abundant in proliferating c2c <dig> myoblasts  <cit> . the data herein confirm these results in satellite cells and also demonstrate that mir- <dig> is present at a high level through most or all of fetal development, and continues through maturation of the adult pig. the constant high-level presence at all stages following early differentiation suggests that the role of mir- <dig> is to repress functions associated with muscle precursor cells.

in comparison to the high abundance of mir- <dig> in muscle tissue, porcine mir- <dig> had relatively moderate abundance that increased throughout development, similar to the pattern observed for this mir in mouse muscle development  <cit> . these data suggest that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> play different roles in muscle development, with mir- <dig> affecting regulation of genes that require inactivation in later fetal stages and mir- <dig> having a more constant role in repressing genes immediately after differentiation. in contrast to mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> was detected only at low levels in fetal development yet increased in the neonate and adult . based on abundance level, these data suggest that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> may have a greater role in fetal muscle development than mir- <dig>  or their targets are higher in abundance. in addition, both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> promote differentiation  <cit> , suggesting that these two mir may have a greater impact compared to mir- <dig> on increased differentiation, which characterizes fetal development  <cit> .

in addition to muscle-specific mir, a larger number of ubiquitous mir were present across all libraries. while a greater percentage of ubiquitous mir were lowly abundant throughout development, a number increased in abundance at specific developmental stages. mir present  <dig> fold greater in satellite cells compared to neonate muscle included mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  slightly below the factor-of-ten cut-off included mir- <dig> at  <dig> . these mir have been implicated in multiple cellular processes including cell growth , apoptosis , and cell cycle regulation in normal  and cancerous cells   <cit> . conversely, research has reported low abundance during proliferation and differentiation in cell culture for these mir with the exception of mir- <dig>  which has a moderately high abundance level during late differentiation  <cit> . this difference in abundance level may be due in part to the different cell culture models utilized in the experiments. chen et al.  <cit>  evaluated mir in an immortalized c2c <dig> cell line, while the experiment herein utilized a porcine primary muscle cell line  during proliferation.

the fetal time points examined in swine were selected to coincide with important events in muscle development, specifically the waves of primary and secondary fiber formation . overall, mir were lowly abundant throughout fetal development with the exception of let- <dig> and muscle specific mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  differential abundance of lowly to moderately abundant mir was observed between time points for primary  and secondary fiber development . mir- <dig> was moderately abundant during early fetal development at d  <dig>  while mir- <dig> abundance increased during d  <dig> and d  <dig>  and mir- <dig> abundance increased during later stages of fetal development at d  <dig> and  <dig>  currently, function of mir- <dig> in muscle development has not been determined. however, previous research reports that mir- <dig> regulates monocyte and macrophage differentiation  <cit> , while mir- <dig> expression alters cell cycle progression of cancer cells by decreasing tumor growth and proliferation  <cit> . four mir, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  were also identified to be specific to the one-day old neonate as demonstrated by a ten-fold increase in abundance level, compared to both the adult muscle and satellite cells, suggesting that these mir may have a role in muscle growth immediately following birth. as for the adult, mir abundance was greatest for mir- <dig> and the muscle specific mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> compared to fetal and neonate mir libraries. while mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> abundance increases during differentiation in cell culture  <cit> , the role of these mir in adult skeletal muscle has yet to be fully determined.

classification of potential novel mir
evaluation of sequence clusters identified two different classifications of novel mir; sequence tags that differed at only one  position and sequence tags that had no match to mir in the database. five observed tags, mir-168a, mir- <dig>  mir-24a, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  represented possible exceptions to the pattern of exact sequence conservation across positions 4â€“ <dig> of the reference mir. these five observed sequences differed from known mir at only one position, and the mir were observed between  <dig> and  <dig> times, and are not likely to be attributable to experimental artifacts. three of the five were observed more frequently without mismatches: mir- <dig>  mir-24a, and mir-168a . interestingly, all of the mir- <dig> related tags displayed mismatches with the reported human mir- <dig> sequence with a single mismatch occurring  <dig> times , indicating that the sus scrofa version of mir- <dig> does indeed differ in sequence from human and mouse. mir- <dig> was observed  <dig> times as a mismatch and only  <dig> times without a mismatch. these five examples of single base mismatches were included in the transcriptome profiles along with those that matched exactly.

in addition to identification of mismatches in the mir- <dig> sequence, length of sequence at the 5' and 3' ends also differed . while there are known instances of highly similar or identical mature mir being produced from discrete genes, it seems more likely that these differences are attributed to minor alterations in processing, cloning or sequencing of mir originating from the same gene. since the goal was to produce relative transcriptome profiles of potential mir during muscle development, we clustered sequences of this type into a single mir sequence, using the most commonly observed sequence of the cluster as the defining sequence for comparisons to known mir.

mir- <dig> differed in length or sequence at the 5' and 3' ends. mir- <dig> sequences of this type were clustered into a single mir sequence identified as the predominant sequence. mir- <dig> sequences with the greatest observations are listed.

combining the data from all transcriptome profiles identified a total of  <dig> distinct mir that matched reference sequences and  <dig> sequences that did not match, and are therefore potential novel or porcine-specific mir   <dig> to pn12; table 2). while a greater number of these novel mir were lowly abundant throughout development, pn <dig> abundance increased in the proliferating satellite cells, neonate, and adult. further validation of these putative novel mir awaits development of the swine genome to look for hallmarks of microrna genes related to these tag sequences.

twelve novel mir were detected that were not closely related to previously reported mir in the database. the mir were given temporary identifiers pn   <dig> to pn <dig> 

computational identification of mir targets
relatively few mirna targets have been identified experimentally, but numerous computational predictions are readily available including miranda, rnahybrid and targetscan  <cit> . initially, mir targets were predicted for a sub-set of the mir up-regulated in this experiment . these mir were predicted by mirna viewer to target  <dig> "common genes" and  <dig> genes when the "all genes" option was chosen. for the purposes of this study, the predicted target genes were narrowed down to include only those with "muscle" listed in the gene ontology, as noted by the entrezgene project  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes were selected based on these criteria . of these,  <dig> targets were identified for the highest expressed mir during fetal development to the adulthood, mir- <dig>  including genes that have been implicated in multiple myogenic processes   <cit> . these predicted targets for mir- <dig> include dystophia myotonica protein kinase, which has been implicated in myotonic dystrophy  <cit>  and the transcription factor paired box gene  <dig> that regulates myogenic cell fate through the myogenic transcription factor myod  <cit> . secondly, targets for a sub-set of down-regulated mir , of which  <dig> targets were identified based on our previous criteria were predicted . from these identified gene targets, the ability to link the specific mir to target transcripts will improve as computational methods evolve, and as the databases of expressed and genomic porcine sequences grow.

CONCLUSIONS
together, these data suggest that mir have a role in progression of myogenesis throughout development and their function may be specific to different stages of skeletal muscle growth. in addition, the data reported herein are the most complete set of transcriptome profiles to evaluate mir abundance in skeletal muscle at specific time points during fetal development of swine. identification of these mir provide an initial group of expressed mir that change in abundance during specific developmental stages and therefore may target genes that regulate this process.
