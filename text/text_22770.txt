BACKGROUND
well-developed seedlings lead to a higher yield stability even under suboptimal growing conditions like reduced nutrient input or drought stress  <cit> . therefore, variation during early developmental stages of brassica napus plants is important for selection decisions of plant breeders. up to now, however, the genetics of seedling development of b. napus had been poorly understood.

in comparison to linkage mapping, association mapping studies could achieve a higher mapping resolution due to the fact that in a diversity set linkage disequilibrium  decays faster than in segregating populations used for linkage mapping  <cit> . furthermore, association mapping studies benefit from the broader array of genetic diversity represented compared to linkage mapping studies  <cit> . hasan et al.  <cit>  identified in an association mapping study in b. napus simple sequence repeat  markers which were physically linked to candidate genes for glucosinolate biosynthesis in arabidopsis thaliana, to be associated with variation of the seed glucosinolate content in b. napus. for traits, for which less preinformation is available, a high number of markers would be necessary to detect phenotype-marker associations on a genome-wide level. the number of ssr markers available in the b. napus genome is expected to be too low for this purpose  <cit> . furthermore, the genotyping of such a high number of markers is very expensive. to overcome this problem, honsdorf et al.  <cit>  tested the association between  <dig> genome-wide distributed amplified fragment-length polymorphism  markers and  <dig> traits in a set of  <dig> canola quality winter rapeseed cultivars. they identified between one and  <dig> putative quantitative trait loci  which explained between  <dig> and 53% of the phenotypic variance for ten of the  <dig> traits. the results of ld analyses suggested, however, that more than  <dig>  evenly distributed markers will be required for detecting marker-phenotype associations with a reasonable power in rapeseed  <cit> . however, it is difficult to obtain a higher number of markers with the aflp technique in rapeseed  <cit> . furthermore, due to the fact that the sequence information of aflps can not be easily inferred, their use in marker-assisted selection programs is difficult. hence, single nucleotide polymorphisms  would be the most suitable marker type to cover a complex genome like that of b. napus in the required density for genome-wide association studies . therefore, a custom snp array was used in this study to genotype the entire diversity set.

differential expression of genes during seedling development stage has the potential to be an important reason for phenotypic variation  <cit> . in our study, genes were selected based on a co-expression network analysis. the gene expression of these genes as well as candidate genes from the literature was examined in the entire diversity set and correlated with the phenotypic observations.

the objectives of our study were to  examine the expression levels of candidate genes in seedling leaves of b.napus and correlate these with seedling development as well as  identify genome regions associated with different gene expression levels and seedling development traits in b. napus.

methods
plant material and assessment of seedling development traits
a set of  <dig> rapeseed inbred lines , assembled to maximize genotypic variation, was used in this study  <cit> . in short, according to available information from genebanks, plant breeders, and our own observations, the accessions were assigned to eight different germplasm types, namely winter oilseed rape  , winter fodder , swede , semi-winter osr , spring osr , spring fodder , vegetable , and so far unspecified rapeseed genotypes .

the multiplication of the genotypes was done in a way such that maternal environmental effects were minimized. the genotypes were grown in six replicates, for  <dig> days in an α-lattice design with  <dig> blocks of  <dig> pots in a greenhouse experiment. as described in detail earlier  <cit> , a large number of seedling development traits were assessed to cover a wide range of aspects as well as developmental stages during seedling growth which could be measured with high throughput methods .table  <dig>

plant material for weighted gene co-expression network analysis
the doubled haploid  winter oilseed rape mapping population exv8-dh which segregates for multiple seed quality, developmental and performance traits was the basis for the weighted gene co-expression network analysis . pooled seedling developmental traits from  <dig> lines of the exv8-dh population, described previously by basunanda et al.  <cit> , were measured in replicated greenhouse trials in  <dig>  and field trials at four locations from 2005- <dig> were used to select two groups of  <dig> exv8-dh lines with the highest and lowest respective mean performance for developmental and yield-related traits.

digital gene expression analysis
for digital gene expression analysis, the  <dig> pre-selected dh lines, the two parents express  <dig> and v <dig>  and their f <dig> , were germinated in jacobsen vessels under controlled conditions in a climate chamber at 20°c for  <dig> h  and 15°c for  <dig> h  with 55% relative humidity. two experimental replications were performed. at two time points   <dig> seedlings from each line were harvested for ribonucleic acid  extraction within one hour to prevent circadian clock effects during transcriptome analysis. all samples were immediately shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c until rna extraction. extraction of messenger rna  and digital gene expression sequencing  was conducted on all as described by obermeier et al.  <cit> . wgcna was performed to identify gene networks correlated to developmental and yield-related traits. within trait-correlated network modules, hub genes showing the highest interconnectivity to other genes in the module were selected as potential regulatory candidates for reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  in thediversity set.

rna extraction, cdna synthesis, and rt-qpcr
a total of  <dig> ng of the leaf apex of the second leaf of each of the  <dig> genotypes of each of the six replicates was collected after  <dig> days of growing in the greenhouse trial as explained in detail by körber et al.  <cit> . after harvest, the sample was directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. the leaf samples were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. total rna was isolated from the fine powder using trizol reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol . the total rna was treated with rnase-free dnase i   to remove genomic deoxyribonucleic acid  contamination. rna concentration was determined using the nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . all samples were diluted to an rna concentration of  <dig> ng/ μl and the samples from the six replicates of each inbred were pooled to equal amounts in order to reduce error variance. first-strand complementary dna  was synthesized from  <dig> μl of total rna using maxima first strand cdna synthesis kit for rt-qpcr  following the manufacturer’s recommendations. the resulting cdna was diluted to  <dig> ng/ μl. gene-specific primers  for  <dig> candidate genes as well as the control gene actin  were used for the rt-qpcrs performed on the cdna samples. amplifications were performed using  <dig> μl of cdna,  <dig> μl of dynamo colorflash sybr green , and  <dig>  μl of each primer. to minimize pipetting inaccuracy, the pipetting of the cdna was done using the pipetting robot biomek fx . the following amplification conditions were used for the rt-qpcr on a lightcycler <dig> : preincubation with 95°c for  <dig> min and amplification with  <dig>  cycles of 95°c , and 60°c . at the end of each run, a dissociation analysis was performed to confirm the specificity of the reaction. in each 384-well plate used for rt-qpcr reaction, non-template controls and cdna of the two trial standards were included. the rt-qpcr products of each of the  <dig> genes  and seven from literature) for five inbreds of the diversity set were sanger sequenced at the max planck genome center cologne to confirm the specific amplifications.table  <dig>

genotyping of snp markers
for the gwas, the  <dig> b. napus inbred lines were assayed at agriculture and agri-food canada using a customized brassica napus 6k illumina infinium snp array . this array was designed from next generation sequence  data from illumina short read  genomic sequence data from seven b. napus cultivars and three b. rapa cultivars, from 3’ captured cdna roche  <dig> sequence data from seven b. napus cultivars and four b. oleracea cultivars as well as illumina short read  rna-seq data from  <dig> b. napus cultivars  <cit> . it contained  <dig>  successful bead types representing the same number of potential snps. samples were prepared and assayed as per the infinium hd assay ultra protocol . the brassica 6k beadchips were imaged using an illumina hiscan system, and the snp alleles were called using the genotyping module v <dig> . <dig>  within the genomestudio software suite v <dig>  . snp data were available for  <dig> inbreds of the diversity set and only snps with a percentage of missing data < 30% across all genotypes and a minor allele frequency >  <dig>  as well as genotypes with a percentage of missing data < 20% across all snps were used for the following statistical analysis. from these  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  could be assigned to a physical map position derived from the reference information of b. rapa  <cit>  and b. oleracea  <cit> .

statistical analyses
weighted gene co-expression network analysis
wgcna was performed using the wgcna r package as described by langfelder and horvath  <cit> . normalized tagcounts  were obtained for  <dig>  probes  using illumina sequencing of 3’est digital gene expression tags. probes were kept if they had a normalized tagcount of at least five in six or more samples. replicate probes for each unigene were averaged and the  <dig>  unigenes present in both datasets were used for the wgcna consensus analysis. a total of  <dig> modules were obtained using the automatic network construction function “blockwiseconsensusmodules” with the following settings; power =  <dig>  minmodulesize =  <dig>  deepsplit =  <dig>  maxblocksize =  <dig>  reassignthreshold =  <dig>  mergecutheight =  <dig> , minkmetojoin =  <dig>  minkmetostay =  <dig>  using the wgcna function “choosetophubineachmodule”, the top hub unigenes were identified from  <dig> modules which were highly conserved between the two datasets and eight of these top hub unigenes could be amplified as functional candidate genes by rt-qpcr in the  <dig> rapeseed inbred lines.

the network of unigenes with an edge weight of ≥  <dig>  was visualized in cytoscape  <cit>  and the function of the modules position was determined using gene ontology singular enrichment analysis   <cit> .

normalization and differences of gene expression data
the c p-value for which the fluorescence rose above the background fluorescence was calculated for each inbred-gene combination using the lightcycler  <dig> software . the c p-value, which was designated in the following as gene expression level of the different genes, was normalized to the percentage of the expression level of the housekeeping gene actin for the corresponding inbred.

associations among inbreds and genes were revealed by a heatmap analysis and grouped with the complete linkage clustering method.

genome positions of the candidate genes
a basic local alignment search tool  search  <cit>  was performed between the reference sequences of the candidate genes and the reference sequences of b. rapa   <cit>  and b. oleracea   <cit> . all positions were used which had a blast identity ≥ 85%.

calculation of adjusted entry means
the adjusted entry mean m of each genotype-trait/-gene combination, which was the basis for all further analyses, were calculated for the seedling development traits and the gene expression data using different mixed-models. for the former, these were calculated as described in detail by körber et al.  <cit> . the calculations for the gene expression data were based on the following model:  yij=μ+gi+tj+eij,  where yij was the observation of the ith genotype of the jth technical replication, μ an intercept term, gi the genotypic effect of the ith genotype, tj the effect of the jth technical replicate, and eij the residual. for calculating the adjusted entry means, gi was regarded as fixed and all other effects as random.

principal component analysis and the assessment of linkage disequilibrium
the  <dig> rapeseed inbreds of our study were assigned to three clusters  using a principal component analysis  of  <dig> ssr markers as described by buset al.  <cit> .

in order to determine the physical map distance in which ld decays in our b. napus diversity set, r <dig>  was calculated, where linked loci were defined as loci located on the same chromosome, and plotted against the physical distance in megabase pairs. the overall decay of ld was evaluated by nonlinear regression of r <dig> according to hill and weir  <cit> . the percentage of linked loci in significant ld was determined with the significance threshold of the 95% quantile of the r <dig> value among unlinked loci pairs, where unlinked loci were defined as loci located on different chromosomes. pairwise modified roger’s distance  estimates between all inbreds and the mclust groups 1- <dig> were calculated according to wright  <cit> .

genome-wide association analyses
the genome-wide association analyses of the seedling development traits and the gene expression data were performed as an single marker analysis using the pk method  <cit> :  mlm=μ+am+∑u=1zpluvu+gl∗+elm,  where mlm was the adjusted entry mean of the lth inbred carrying allele m, a m the effect of the mth allele, v u the effect of the uth column of the population structure matrix p, gl∗ the residual genetic effect of the lth entry, and elm the residual. the first and second principal component calculated based on the  <dig> ssr markers  <cit>  were used as p matrix. the variance of the random effect g∗=g1∗,...,g509∗ was assumed to be var=2kσg∗ <dig>  where σg∗ <dig> was the residual genetic variance. the kinship coefficient kij between inbreds i and j were calculated based on the above mentioned ssr markers according to:  kij=sij−11+t+ <dig>   where s ij was the proportion of marker loci with shared variants between inbreds i and j and t the average probability that a variant from one parent of inbred i and a variant from one parent of inbred j are alike in state, given that they are not identical by descent  <cit> . the optimum t value was calculated according to stich et al.  <cit>  for each trait. to perform the above outlined association analysis, the r package emma  <cit>  was used. we chose the significance threshold of p-value = <dig>  and the threshold after bonferroni correction . the association analysis was performed for all inbreds and for each of the three mclust groups. for the separate association analyses of the three mclust groups, only the kinship matrix k but no p matrix was considered. snps which are associated for multiple traits are defined as hot spots for these traits.

if not stated differently, all analyses were performed with the statistical software r  <cit> .

gene expression data
the expression levels of the  <dig> candidate genes examined in the  <dig> b. napus inbreds showed an averaged standard deviation  of  <dig>  across all inbreds and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average mrd  of the mclust groups  <dig> to  <dig> vs. the other two mclust groups were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  , respectively.

the consensus wgcna for the two datasets allocated  <dig>  unigenes into  <dig> modules, where  <dig>  unigenes were unassigned. each module comprised between  <dig> and  <dig>  unigenes. the candidate genes were selected as the top hub genes from  <dig> modules which were highly conserved between the two datasets, and for eight of them amplification via qrt-pcr was successful . seven further candidate genes were selected from main metabolic pathways.figure  <dig> co-expression network. co-expression correlation network of  <dig> genes for the 8das dataset showing the relationship of the modules in different colors and the names of the eight regulatory candidate genes. the position of the eight candidate genes is shown in the network together with the function of each module.



across the examined  <dig> candidate genes, the gene apl was expressed on average lowest relative to actin, whereas the gene rbc was expressed highest . the genes apl, ubp <dig>  pect, grf <dig>  and sps were assigned to a cluster of genes which had a lower expression compared to actin, whereas all the other genes clustered to a group of highly expressed genes. furthermore, based on the expression levels of the  <dig> genes, the  <dig> inbreds were clustered in five different subgroups comprising different germplasm types.figure  <dig> heatmap of the expression levels. heatmap of the expression levels of the studied candidate genes in seedling leaves of b. napus relative to the expression levels of the housekeeping gene actin for the  <dig> inbreds of the diversity set. on the x-axis, the  <dig> candidate genes are plotted and the y-axis shows the  <dig> b. napus inbreds with their corresponding germplasm type. the dendrogram of the  <dig> b. napus inbreds is based on the gene expression data. genes with a blue mark have an expression level lower than the expression levels of the housekeeping gene actin and red marked genes have an higher expression level.



the expression levels of the analysed genes differed between the eight germplasm subsets and the three mclust groups. across all  <dig> inbreds, the expression levels of the genes fbp, sps, rbc, pk, ubp <dig>  pect, apl, ailp <dig>  ger <dig>  noi, grf <dig>  and gf <dig> were significantly higher  in the mainly modern winter osr and spring osr germplasm types compared to the remaining subsets. in contrast, the expression levels of the genes cel <dig> and myap showed the opposite trend . the genes sps, ubp <dig>  pect, ailp <dig>  myap, grf <dig>  vps <dig>  and gf <dig> were significantly  higher expressed in the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> than in the inbreds of the mclust groups  <dig> and  <dig>  on the other hand, the genes fbp, rbc, apl, ger <dig>  and noi were significantly higher expressed in the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> and the genes cel <dig> and myap for the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> .figure  <dig> candidate gene ribulose  <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit. distribution of the expression level of the gene rbc relative to the housekeeping gene actin across all  <dig> inbreds ordered by the gene expression level.  violinplot of the gene expression level of rbc for the eight different germplasm types and  for the three mclust groups.

p-value of the association test. the horizontal dashed and dotted lines indicate the p-value =  <dig>  threshold and the threshold after bonferroni correction , respectively.



the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the expression of the  <dig> candidate genes with the  <dig> seedling development traits for all  <dig> inbreds was on average  <dig>  with a range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the candidate genes ger <dig> and fbp were mostly negatively correlated with the seedling development traits with a correlation coefficient down to - <dig> . in contrast, the candidate genes ailp <dig> and pect were mostly positively correlated with the seedling development traits with a correlation coefficient up to  <dig>  .

genome-wide association mapping
in the gwas with  <dig>  snps for all  <dig> b. napus inbreds, we observed a total of  <dig> snp-trait associations with a p-value <  <dig>  for  <dig> of the  <dig> seedling development traits. a total of  <dig> % of these snp-trait associations were detected for the a genome and more than half of them were located on the chromosomes a <dig> and a <dig>  in contrast,  <dig> % of the associations were detected for the c genome and most of them were located on the chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig>  in addition, two snp-trait associations could not be mapped to the genome of b. napus . the  <dig> associations explained individually from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. furthermore, between one and  <dig> snp-trait associations were associated with the same trait and these explained in simultaneous fits between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance .table  <dig>

for the association analysis of the gene expression levels, we observed across all  <dig> b. napus inbreds  <dig> snp-gene associations for  <dig> of the  <dig> examined genes with a p-value <  <dig> . a total of  <dig> % of these snp-gene associations were located on the a genome, whereas no clustering across the chromosomes was observed. in contrast,  <dig> % were identified for the c genome and 40% of them were located on the chromosomes c <dig> and c <dig> . we identified between one and six snps to be associated with the gene expression variation of the individual genes. the identified snps explained individually from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. furthermore, between two and seven snp-gene associations were associated with the same gene and these explained in simultaneous fits between  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance .figure  <dig> gwas: snp-trait/-gene associations of all  <dig> inbreds of the b. napus diversity set. all single nucleotide polymorphism -trait/-gene associations with a p-value <  <dig>  identified across all  <dig> inbreds and their respective positions are marked on the b. napus genome. the  <dig>  snps with their minor allele frequencies are given in the outer circle. the snps associated with the candidate gene expression based on the gene expression data are plotted in orange below the allele frequency circle and the seedling development snp-trait associations in blue outside the allele frequency circle. the size of the letters is related to the proportion of the variance explained by the associations. in the inner circle of the  <dig> chromosomes, the candidate genes were plotted to their mapping position on the b. rapa and b. oleracea reference genomes. potential cis-regulated candidate genes were colored red. the a genome is colored blue and the c genome green.



across all  <dig> inbreds, the snp-fbp association of the gene expression levels was identical with the snp-asr association of the seedling development traits on chromosome c <dig>  the snp-gene associations of myap, pk, and sps and the snp-trait association of spd on chromosome c <dig> as well as the snp-gene association of pk and the snp-trait association of h2o on chromosome a <dig> were also identical for all  <dig> inbreds. furthermore, for the mclust group  <dig> the snp-gene association of pect on chromosome c <dig> corresponded with the associations of the projected leaf area hot spot of the seedling development traits.

correspondence of associations across subgroups
in the p-value profile from the genome-wide association mapping, several snp-rbc associations with a p-value <  <dig>  were detected on chromosome a <dig> for all  <dig> inbreds and the inbreds of the mclust groups 1- <dig>  as well as on chromosome c <dig> for all  <dig> inbreds and the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> . furthermore, mentionable snp-rbc associations with a p-value <  <dig>  were observed on chromosome c <dig> for the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> and on chromosome c <dig> for the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> .

the snp-rbc associations detected on chromosome a <dig> and c <dig> for all  <dig> b. napus inbreds and the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> were in accordance with their physical map position. furthermore, for the inbreds of the mclust group  <dig> the snp-rbc association on chromosome a <dig> was also in accordance with its physical map position, but not on chromosome c <dig>  where the distance in between was ~ <dig>  mb. in addition, the snp-fbp associations were in accordance with their mapped genome positions on chromosome a <dig> and c <dig> for all inbreds .figure  <dig> gwas: snp-trait/-gene associations of the inbreds of the mclust groups  <dig> of the b. napus diversity set. all single nucleotide polymorphism -trait/-gene associations with a p-value <  <dig>  identified across the inbreds of the mclust groups  <dig> and their respective positions are marked on the b. napus genome. the  <dig>  snps with their frequencies of the allele being the minor allele in the  <dig> inbreds are given in the outer circle. the snps associated with the candidate gene expression based on the gene expression data are plotted in orange below the allele frequency circle and the seedling development snp-trait associations in blue outside the allele frequency circle. the size of the letters is related to the proportion of the variance explained by the associations. in the inner circle of the  <dig> chromosomes, the candidate genes were plotted to their mapping position on the b. rapa and b. oleracea reference genomes. potential cis-regulated candidate genes were colored red. the a genome is colored blue and the c genome green.



discussion
linkage disequilibrium and snp density
the nonlinear trend line of ld measure r <dig> decayed below the significance threshold, the 95% quantile of the r <dig> value among unlinked loci pairs, within a distance of  <dig> kb . bus et al.  <cit>  estimated based on  <dig> ssr markers that the pairwise ld decayed within a genetic map distance of approximately  <dig> cm. this corresponds to about  <dig> kb  <cit>  and is in good accordance to the value observed in our study. the ld observed by ecke et al.  <cit>  decayed within  <dig> cm less fast. the reason for this observation could be that the population studied by ecke et al.  <cit>  was less diverse than the b. napus diversity set examined in the current study.

in our study,  <dig>  snps mapped to the a genome, whereas  <dig>  snps mapped to the c genome. furthermore,  <dig> % of the adjacent snps on the a genome and  <dig> % of the adjacent snps on the c genome had a distance smaller than the average range of ld . therefore, this gwas is expected to result on average in  <dig> % of the possible power . compared to previous studies in b. napus, the snp marker density of our study is expected to provide a higher power to detect snp-trait/-gene associations in the b. napus diversity set.

genome-wide association mapping of seedling development traits
seedling development traits are important targets for breeding because an optimal seedling development leads to a higher yield stability even under suboptimal growing conditions  <cit> . up to now, however, little is known about the genetic mechanisms as well as the natural variation of seedling development in b. napus. thus, we used an association mapping approach to elucidate the genetics of seedling development in b. napus.

we observed a total of  <dig> associations between snps and  <dig> of the  <dig> seedling development traits with a p-value <  <dig>  . furthermore, for the  <dig> seedling development traits we found between one and  <dig> snp-trait associations for a single trait which explained in a simultaneous fit, on average,  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance with a range from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . the large number of associations for these  <dig> seedling development traits suggests that these are genetically complex inherited. in contrast to the seedling development traits examined in our study, honsdorf et al.  <cit>  carried out an association analysis of phenological, morphological, and quality traits in  <dig> canola quality winter rapeseed  and identified  <dig> putative qtls for ten of  <dig> traits which explained, on average,  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. these differences in the explained phenotypic variance could be due to the fact that honsdorf et al.  <cit>  analysed agronomic and seed quality traits instead of seedling development traits and that a lower number of genotypes were examined compared to our study. the latter leads to an overestimation of marker effects. this overestimation, however, decreases with a higher number of genotypes in a gwas  <cit> . thus, in a gwas with  <dig> inbreds this overestimation is expected to be of minor importance.

for the seedling development traits projected leaf area la <dig>  la <dig>  la <dig>  la <dig>  and la <dig>  we identified five different hot spots  on the chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> for all inbreds and/or the mclust groups  <dig> to  <dig> . they explained in a simultaneous fit between  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance . basunanda et al.  <cit>  found in sets of b. napus backcrossed test hybrids a qtl for leaf area of  <dig> days old seedlings in the middle of chromosome a <dig> at  <dig>  cm which explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. furthermore, edwards and weinig  <cit>  measured the leaf area of one young, fully expanded leaf at bolting of  <dig> b. rapa recombinant inbred lines  across simulated seasonal settings and detected at cool temperature and short photoperiod conditions a qtl in the middle of chromosome a <dig> at  <dig>  cm which explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. these discrepancies in the different studies can be explained by dissimilarities in the power to detect qtls as well as genotype x environment and qtl x environment interactions by examining different genetic material. all three factors have the potential to lead to different qtls in different studies  <cit> .figure  <dig> gwas: snp-trait/-gene associations of the inbreds of the mclust groups  <dig> of the b. napus diversity set. all single nucleotide polymorphism -trait/-gene associations with a p-value <  <dig>  identified across the inbreds of the mclust groups  <dig> and their respective positions are marked on the b. napus genome. the  <dig>  snps with their frequencies of the allele being the minor allele in the  <dig> inbreds are given in the outer circle. the snps associated with the candidate gene expression based on the gene expression data are plotted in orange below the allele frequency circle and the seedling development snp-trait associations in blue outside the allele frequency circle. the size of the letters is related to the proportion of the variance explained by the associations. in the inner circle of the  <dig> chromosomes, the candidate genes were plotted to their mapping position on the b. rapa and b. oleracea reference genomes. potential cis-regulated candidate genes were colored red. the a genome is colored blue and the c genome green.



the leaf area association hot spots for mclust group  <dig> and  <dig> on chromosome c <dig> were separated by ∼  <dig> kb. as the average range of ld in the examined diversity set was with  <dig> kb close to the separation on the physical map of ∼  <dig> kb, no differentiation between linkage or pleiotropy was possible in our study.

we identified association hot spots for leaf area on the bottom of chromosome a <dig>  and on the top of chromosome c <dig>  . furthermore, blast searches revealed that the two candidate genes ger <dig> and gf <dig> are located up- and downstream of these two hot spots, respectively. thus, these two genome regions with its flanking candidate genes might be homologous regions. in contrast, the candidate gene sequence of myap was mapped by a blast search on the top of chromosome a <dig> and on the bottom of chromosome c <dig> . lydiate et al.  <cit>  and parkin et al.  <cit>  identified with  <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers homologous genome regions between the top of chromosome a <dig> and the top of chromosome c <dig> in reverse direction as well as between the bottom of chromosome a <dig> and the bottom of chromosome c <dig>  however, our result implies that these homologous genome regions might be interchanged and that the genome region on the top of chromosome a <dig> is homologous to the genome region on the bottom of chromosome c <dig> and that the genome region on the bottom of chromosome a <dig> is homologous to the genome region on the top of chromosome c <dig>  this finding is in good accordance to the results of parkin et al.  <cit>  who analysed genome duplications within the b. napus genome with  <dig> rflp markers and reported translocated regions which are inverted between a <dig> and c <dig> and between a <dig> and c <dig> 

the mrd between the mclust groups  <dig> to  <dig> versus the other two mclust groups were, on average,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, the phenotypic variation of the examined seedling development traits which was explained by population structure, was on average  <dig> % . for some traits, the correspondence of the detected associations was low between the three subgroups. the reason for this observation can be a different genetic architecture in the three subgroups. furthermore, different allele frequencies at the corresponding snps in the three different groups and the resulting differences in power to detect the associations can be the reason. it is impossible to decide based on association mapping results on one of the two reasons. this would require further analyses examining a set of bi-parental populations. nevertheless, in this study we present in addition to the results of the subgroups also the results across all  <dig> inbreds to benefit from the higher power to detect snp-trait/-gene associations.

variation of gene expression in seedling leaves
in the framework of our study, it was not possible to perform a genome-wide gene expression study with the available budget. therefore, we selected seven candidate genes from main metabolic pathways to examine their correlation with seedling development traits. furthermore, the top hub genes from a wgcna were studied because of their potential role as high level regulators .

we observed a high expression of rbc in the seedling leaves of all  <dig> b. napus inbreds . this could be explained by the fact that rubisco  is the most abundant protein in plants  <cit> . the low expression levels of apl which is the predominant large subunit isoform in leaves  <cit>   were due to the fact that apl  is involved in starch synthesis  <cit> , and starch in exporting leaves represents only a transient store  <cit> .

the expression levels of the  <dig> candidate genes examined in the  <dig> b. napus inbreds showed an averaged standard deviation  of  <dig>  across all inbreds and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for  <dig> a. thaliana samples, the sds for more than  <dig>  genes mostly varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . the considerably higher sd in our study compared to that of hruz et al.  <cit>  might be due to the fact that our examined candidate genes were selected based on the expected different expression levels in b. napus seedlings. our observation suggested that the measured gene expression differences between the  <dig> b. napus inbreds were more than adequate for the correlation with phenotypic variation of seedling development.

the candidate genes ger <dig>  ailp <dig>  pect, and fbp had the highest correlations with the seedling development traits. ger <dig> might play a role in plant defense, ailp <dig> is involved in the response to the stimulus of auxin and aluminum ion, pect is part of the phospholipid synthesis, and fbp is an enzyme that converts fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in gluconeogenesis and the calvin cycle and many other metabolic pathways. thus, these genes have an essential effect on the development of rapeseed seedlings and could have great potential for breeding rapeseed varieties with improved seedling development. therefore, not only markers associated with seedling development traits could be used for marker-assisted selection in b. napus to improve seedling development but also the expression of genes correlated with seedling development.

genome-wide associations mapping of gene expression correlated with seedling development
we mapped the gene expression levels of the  <dig> candidate genes in our diversity set to identify genome regions contributing to their regulation. these regions could comprise genes or specific regulators of genes influencing seedling development and might be useful for marker-assisted selection in b. napus to improve the seedling development.

we found across all  <dig> b. napus inbreds  <dig> snp-gene associations for  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate genes with a p-value <  <dig> . these snps associated with the expression of the candidate genes explained in a simultaneous fit on average  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for a single gene . this is in accordance with the findings of the seedling development traits which explained in a simultaneous fit, on average,  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for a single trait . from this it follows that the expression levels of the candidate genes and the seedling development traits have a similar genetic complexity.

the snp-gene association of pect on chromosome c <dig> for the mclust group  <dig> is identical with the association of the projected leaf area hot spot of the seedling development traits. mizoi et al.  <cit>  observed that pect1-4/pect1- <dig> f <dig> arabidopsis mutants displayed severe dwarfism. pect is involved as the rate-limiting step in the kennedy pathway   <cit>  and plays a major role in the structure and function of membranes  <cit> . thus, the snp-pect association on chromosome c <dig> may caused the differences in leaf area growth of the examined b. napus seedlings.

the genome positions of the snp-gene associations of rbc on the chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig> and fbp on the chromosomes a <dig> and c <dig> were in accordance with their genome position . according to chen et al.  <cit>  these associations were defined as cis-regulated, because the snp-gene associations were within  <dig> kb upstream or downstream of this gene position mapped by a blast search. in the neighborhood of the snp-gene association of the candidate gene rbc on chromosome a <dig> at  <dig> , <dig> bp the b. napus genes bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig> were located. their best blastx hits to a. thaliana are the genes at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> which are encoding the rubisco small subunit 2b or 1b of a. thaliana, respectively. furthermore, the snp-gene association of fbp on chromosome a <dig> at  <dig> , <dig> bp is nearby the b. napus gene bra <dig> of which the best hit by blastx to a. thaliana is the gene at3g <dig> encoding for fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate phosphatase. all the other snp-gene associations were outside this range and therefore defined as trans-regulated . thus, these trans-regulatory snp-gene associations most likely encode transcriptional regulators which requires further research.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we conducted the largest genome-wide association study on seedling development traits in brassica napus using a diversity set comprising  <dig> inbreds. a total of  <dig> % of the adjacent snps on the a genome and  <dig> % of the adjacent snps on the c genome had a distance smaller than the average range of ld. therefore, this genome-wide association study is expected to result on average in  <dig> % of the possible power. compared to previous studies in b. napus, the snp marker density of our study is expected to provide a higher power to detect snp-trait/-gene associations in the b. napus diversity set. the large number of associations detected for the examined  <dig> seedling development traits indicated that these are genetically complex inherited. based on a weighted gene co-expression network analysis in a segregating population, regulatory genes were selected to analyse their gene expression in seedling leaves in the diversity set. the candidate genes ger <dig>  ailp <dig>  pect, and fbp were strongly correlated with the seedling development traits. thus, these genes might be interesting targets for breeding and have potential for breeding rapeseed varieties with improved seedling development. for the projected leaf area traits, we identified five different association hot spots on the chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  further research is required to identify the causative polymorphisms in these association hot spots.
