BACKGROUND
baculoviruses  consist of rod-shaped, arthropod-specific viruses with double-stranded, circular dna genomes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb and enveloped nucleocapsids  <cit> . the occluded form of the virus is embedded in proteinaceous occlusion bodies   <cit> . baculoviridae is subdivided into four genera, alphabaculovirus , betabaculovirus , gammabaculovirus  and deltabaculovirus   <cit> . the lepidopteran-specific npvs are further classed into two groups, i and ii, based on the phylogenetic analysis of their polyhedrin  genes  <cit> . most of the npvs with sequenced genomes are lepidopteran specific. however, the genomes of culex nigripalpus npv, which infects dipteran, and three neodiprion npvs which have been isolated from hymenopteran insect species, have also been sequenced  <cit> . to date, more than fifty baculovirus isolates have been sequenced . baculoviruses are used worldwide as protein expression vectors, biotechnological tools and biological control agents of agricultural and forest pests.

the casuarina moth, lymantria xylina swinehoe , is an herbivore that feeds on casuarina , guava , longan , lychee , acacia  forests and more than  <dig> other species of host plants  <cit> . it is native to taiwan, japan, india, and the eastern coast of mainland china  <cit> . in the last  <dig> years in taiwan, many forests have been converted to agricultural land. the moth has expanded into these newly established agricultural areas and simultaneously expanded its host plant range  <cit> . l. dispar is a closely related species to l. xylina  <cit> . the l. dispar mnpv  isolated from its natural host, l. dispar, had been characterised and sequenced in  <dig>  <cit>  and used in integrated pest management  programs to control this pest for many years in america  <cit> .

npv epizootics occur in populations of l. xylina each year from spring to early summer in taiwan and mainland china, and the key pathogen was found to be l. xylina multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit> . following the establishment of an in vitro propagation system for lyxymnpv in the cell lines iplb-ld652y  and ntu-ly   <cit> , lyxymnpv and host-virus interaction studies were promoted. in previous tissue culture infectivity studies of three lymantriid npvs , only one cell line, iplb-ld-652y, was able to support infection and replication of all three npvs  <cit> . additionally, perina nuda npv , which was isolated from p. nuda, could also infect both ly and ld cells and l. xylina larvae in our laboratory  <cit> . of these lymantriidae-derived npv species, lyxymnpv/ldmnpv and penunpv/opmnpv were thought to be closely related  <cit> . however, molecular evidence has supported them as distinct species  <cit> . therefore, the precise relationship between lyxymnpv and ldmnpv needs to be further clarified. in our previous study, lyxymnpv and another less prevalent npv species were shown to coexsist in the infected larvae in the fields of taiwan  <cit> . the less prevalent npv was isolated and characterised as ldmnpv-like virus  <cit> .

in this study, we reported the complete genomic sequence of lyxymnpv, which is the most prevalent virus strain in the infected l. xylina larvae and described the whole genomic sequence, gene structure and performed a phylogenetic analysis. the genome sequences were compared to the previously published ldmnpv  <cit>  and group i npv type species, autographa californica mnpv  <cit> . because opmnpv  <cit>  is another lymantriidae-derived npv species that can infect ld cells and maruca vitrata mnpv   <cit>  can also infect ld cells at low level, these two group i npvs were also compared to lyxymnpv.

RESULTS
general characteristics of the lyxymnpv genome
the lyxymnpv genome size is  <dig>   <dig> bp  and has a g+c content of  <dig> % . orfs were predicted according to the initial criteria for further study. however, three orfs that had large overlap found in lyxymnpv were also selected for further study, namely lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> . lyxy <dig>  overlaps with lyxy <dig>  by  <dig> aa in the same direction, but not in the same frame. a p <dig> homologue  was found located in the c-terminal portion of lyxy <dig> , designated as lyxy37'. lyxy <dig>  is  <dig> aa long and overlaps with lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig> by  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa, respectively. lyxy <dig> , which is  <dig> aa long, overlaps with lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig> by  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa, respectively. therefore, a total of  <dig> orfs were identified for further analysis , and nucleotides in the lyxymnpv genome were numbered sequentially, beginning with the a  of the polyhedrin start codon . the directions of the transcripts are indicated by arrows. the ratio of the orf orientations was almost equal to 1: <dig>  for those oriented clockwise with respect to the orientation of the polh gene  <cit>  . most of the  <dig> lyxymnpv orfs have an assigned function or homologues in other baculoviruses. as shown in table  <dig>  four unique orfs were found in the lyxymnpv genome. there are  <dig> conserved genes in all baculovirus genomes, including the dipteran and hymenopteran baculoviruses  <cit>  and all of these genes were found in the lyxymnpv genome. a total of  <dig> baculovirus-repeated orfs  were also sequenced. beside these  <dig> predicted orfs, other internal spaces were made up of intergenic spaces and homologous regions . the lyxymnpv genome has  <dig> hrs  , and the orientations of the hrs were related to those of ldmnpv .

* lyxymnpv unique genes are underlined.

promoter analysis
promoter motifs present upstream of the  <dig> putative orfs were screened.  <dig> lyxymnpv orfs were shown to possess consensus early gene promoter motif . three of these orfs, lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig> , were also shown to possess consensus late gene promoter motif, which may allow transcription of these genes during both the early and late stages of infection. this has also been reported for ac <dig>  and ac <dig>   <cit> . a total of  <dig> lyxymnpv orfs were shown to possess consensus late gene promoter motif. additionally, the upstream  <dig> bp of  <dig> lyxymnpv orfs had an enhancer-like element consisting of a cgtgc motif . a total of  <dig> lyxymnpv orfs did not possess consensus late or early promoter sequences. it seems likely that additional, as-yet-unidentified, promoter sequences might exist within the lyxymnpv genome, as in other baculoviruses  <cit> . unlike most baculoviruses, the p <dig> of lyxymnpv lacks a late promoter  <cit> .

comparison of lyxymnpv orfs to other baculoviruses
lyxymnpv shares  <dig> orfs with acmnpv,  <dig> orfs with opmnpv,  <dig> orfs with mavimnpv,  <dig> with ldmnpv,  <dig> with semnpv and  <dig> with cpgv . the average amino acid sequence identity between lyxymnpv and acmnpv  <cit> , opmnpv  <cit> , mavimnpv  <cit> , ldmnpv  <cit> , semnpv  <cit>  and cpgv  <cit>  were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. four orfs  were identified unique to lyxymnpv . three pairs of adjacent acmnpv orfs  were fused together into single orfs  in lyxymnpv. as reported for rachiplusia ou mnpv-r <dig>  re-sequencing of these regions in acmnpv-c <dig> had found that the orf pairs occurred as a single orf in the stock of acmnpv-c <dig>  <cit> . the homologues of these orfs were also found in other baculovirus genomes in which they are fused into a single orf. three adjacent ldmnpv orfs  that were in the same orientation were also fused into a single orf  in lyxymnpv.

geneparityplot analysis
comparisons of the gene arrangement of the selected orfs are shown in fig.  <dig>  the gene arrangement of the lyxymnpv genome was highly colinear to that of ldmnpv. however, a large fragment flanked by lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig>  in the lyxymnpv genome showed an inversion compared to ldmnpv . the gene arrangement of the lyxymnpv genome showed lower colinearity to acmnpv, opmnpv, mavimnpv and semnpv. in contrast, the parity analysis of the lyxymnpv and cpgv orfs displayed a much more dispersed pattern.

lyxymnpv structural genes
compared to the  <dig> baculovirus structural genes listed by hayakawa et al. , herniou et al.,  and jehle et al.  <cit> , only two genes were identified to be absent in the lyxymnpv genome. these genes included the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene  and group i npv-specific gp <dig> , which is the major envelope fusion protein gene of acmnpv  <cit> , bombyx mori mnpv   <cit> , opmnpv  <cit>  and epiphyas postvittana npv   <cit> . the gp <dig> protein appears to be unique to group i npvs  <cit> . in ldmnpv, the f protein, an envelope fusion protein functionally analogous to the gp <dig> protein, is a product of the ld <dig> gene. lyxymnpv encodes an f protein homologue, lyxy <dig>  which shows 96% aa identity to ld <dig>  ld <dig> homologues are present in all lepidopteran and dipteran baculoviruses that have been completely sequenced, including those that contain gp <dig>  the role of the ld <dig> homologue in the latter species is unclear, but it is likely that they have lost their envelope fusion properties  <cit> . of these structural proteins, the polyhedrin protein was the most conserved . in contrast, the products of genes pif- <dig>  orf <dig> and vp <dig> showed the lowest levels  of sequence conservation between lyxymnpv and ldmnpv . a special characteristic of lyxymnpv is that lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> are homologous to odv-e <dig>  lyxy <dig> is flanked by homologues of ld <dig> and ld <dig>  while lyxy <dig> is close to lyxymnpv hr <dig> and located between lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> which are homologues of ld <dig> and ld <dig>  respectively. the identity between lyxy <dig> and its ldmnpv homologue  is up to 84%. however, the identity between the two lyxymnpv odv-e <dig> genes is quite low  which is not significantly higher than that to the acmnpv, mavimnpv or semnpv even anpenpv homologues . the region of lyxy <dig> has probably undergone extensive rearrangement, because ld <dig> homologue gene of other different baculoviruses is located in the similar site of lyxy <dig>  therefore, it is possible that lyxy <dig> was acquired from other npv species . in acmnpv, the odv-e <dig> protein was incorporated into both the envelope and capsid of the occluded virus  <cit> . however, only odv-e <dig>  of lyxymnpv has a late promoter motif. therefore, it is possible that only one odv-e <dig> is transcribed in lyxymnpv, and that it serves as a structural protein of the envelope and capsid of an occluded virus. it is notable that p <dig>  of lyxymnpv has a large n-terminal extension. the identity between lyxy37' and its ldmnpv homologue  is up to 87%, which is much higher than that of lyxy <dig> and ld <dig> . lyxy <dig> has early and late promoter motifs, but lyxy37' has only one late promoter motif. there may be two forms of p <dig> found in the early and late stages of lyxymnpv-infected larvae or cells. the average identity of these structural proteins was generally  <dig> % between lyxymnpv and ldmnpv , suggesting that the structure of the viruses may be similar.

transcription-specific genes
the genes involved in baculovirus late gene transcription that are present on other baculovirus genomes are also present in the lyxymnpv genome, with no exceptions, including lef 4- <dig>  8- <dig>  39k, p <dig> and vlf- <dig>  <cit> . these genes are found in lyxymnpv as lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig>  respectively. most of these genes were 80%-96% identical in amino acid sequences to those of ldmnpv. however, we noted that the amino acid identity of ldmnpv lef- <dig> and lyxymnpv lef- <dig> aa was only 64%.

dna replication and repair genes
a total of  <dig> lef genes in acmnpv have been implicated in dna replication and transcription  <cit> . baculovirus early genes are transcribed by the host cell rna polymerase ii, but this is often transactivated by genes such as ie- <dig>  ie- <dig>  ie- <dig> and pe <dig>  <cit> . of these genes, ie- <dig> and ie- <dig> are present in lyxymnpv. six baculovirus genes have previously been reported as essential dna replication factors for baculoviruses, including lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  dnapol, helicase and ie- <dig>  <cit> , which are all present in lyxymnpv. these genes are conserved with respect to those of ldmnpv , with the exception of lef- <dig> . homologues of a single-stranded dna-binding protein   <cit>  and an immediate-early gene, me <dig>  both of which have been implicated in dna replication, were also found in lyxymnpv. additionally, similar to ldmnpv, lyxymnpv also has two dbp . the amino acid sequence identities of the two dbp to those of ldmnpv were 75% and 80% for lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig>  respectively. however, the amino acid identity was very low between the two . genes for enzymatic functions in nucleotide metabolism, such as the large  and small  subunits of ribonucleotide reductase and deoxyuridyltriphosphate , which are found in several baculoviruses, were also present in lyxymnpv, with the exception of rr <dig>  three genes that encode ribonucleotide reductase were found in ldmnpv. these include a homologue of the large subunit and two homologues of the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase copies  <cit> . the rr <dig> of lyxymnpv  was more similar to ld <dig>  than to ld <dig>  homologues. these enzymes are involved in nucleotide metabolism and catalyse the reduction of host cell rntps to dntps  <cit> . in addition, the homologues of non-essential dna replication stimulatory genes, ie- <dig>  lef- <dig> and pe <dig>  <cit> , which were unique in group i npv, were not present in lyxymnpv.

genes with auxiliary functions
auxiliary genes are not essential for viral replication, but provide a selective advantage to increase virus production/survival either at the cellular level or at the level of the organism  <cit> . a total of thirteen auxiliary genes have homologues in lyxymnpv, including proteinkinase- <dig> , p <dig>  ubiquitin , conotoxinlike peptide- <dig> , chitinase, cathepsin l-like proteinase , superoxide dismutases , viral enhancing factor- <dig>  , vef- <dig>  ecdysteroid udp glucosyltransferase , actin rearrangement-inducing factor- <dig> , viral fibroblast growth factor  and alkaline exonuclease . almost all of these auxiliary genes in lyxymnpv were 81%-95% identical in amino acid sequence to those of ldmnpv, except arif- <dig> and ctl- <dig>  lyxymnpv arif- <dig> was 64% identical to that of ldmnpv and its ctl- <dig> was 66% and 40% identical to opmnpv and ldmnpv, respectively.

conotoxins are small disulfide-rich ion channel antagonists isolated from the gastropod genus conus  <cit> . a single ctl gene is present in acmnpv . in contrast, the ldmnpv and opmnpv genomes encode two ctl genes, called ctl- <dig> and ctl- <dig>  however, there is only one ctl gene  found in lyxymnpv, which has low amino acid identity to ldmnpv. this is because ldmnpv ctl- <dig> has a longer amino acid size  than the other baculovirus ctls. the biological function of ctl remains unclear, as no difference in mortality, motility, or weight gain was observed when neonate or late instar spodoptera frugiperda larvae were infected with the acmnpv ctl- <dig> deletion mutant compared to infection with wild-type virus  <cit> .

the large vef protein is metalloprotease that appears to degrade mucin and is thought to facilitate the approach of baculoviral virions to the surface of gut cells by disrupting the peritrophic membrane  <cit> . this protein forms ~5% of the mass of obs of the trichoplusia gv  <cit> . the vef gene does not exist in the acmnpv  <cit>  or opmnpv  <cit>  genomes, but ldmnpv has two vef genes, vef- <dig> and vef- <dig>  previous studies have revealed that both ldmnpv enhancins contributed to viral infectivity  <cit> . two copies of vef  have been identified in the lyxymnpv genome . the two gene products show low amino acid identity to each other . auxiliary genes that are present in other lepidopteran npvs but are not in lyxymnpv include pcna, pk- <dig>  ptp- <dig> and ctl- <dig> 

anti-apoptosis genes
apoptosis or cell death can be a mechanism to defend against the establishment of infections and is usually triggered in the early period of virus infection. baculoviruses possess two families of genes that suppress apoptosis: the p35/p <dig> family and the inhibitor of apoptosis  family. it has been shown that p <dig> blocks diverse pathways of apoptosis and plays a role in blocking acmnpv-induced apoptosis in sf <dig> cell  <cit> . this gene has been reported in a number of baculoviruses, such as acmnpv, bmnpv, romnpv, s. litura mnpv  and mavimnpv  <cit> .

the iap family of genes have been found in all family members of the baculoviridae sequenced to date. iap homologues generally contain two baculovirus iap repeats , which are associated with binding to apoptosis-inducing proteins, and a c-terminal zinc finger-like  cys/his motif  <cit> . these features have enabled the iap genes to be divided into five groups from iap- <dig> to iap- <dig>  <cit> . apoptotic inhibition has been recovered in acmnpv p <dig> deletion mutants with a variety of baculovirus iap homologues  <cit> . in the lyxymnpv genome, two iaps were observed, iap- <dig>  and iap- <dig> . both iaps only have one bir domain and one ring domain in the predicted amino acid sequences.

baculovirus repeated orfs 
a striking feature of most lepidopteran and dipteran npvs sequenced to date and in some of the gvs is the presence of one to  <dig> copies of bro genes. typically bro genes are highly conserved, repetitive and widely distributed amongst insect dna viruses  <cit> . the function of these genes is unclear, but they have been shown to bind to dna  <cit> . these genes have also been found to be associated with the regions of viral genome rearrangement  <cit> . lyxymnpv contains  <dig> bro genes, which have been named bro-a to bro-n based on their order in the genome . most bros contain a core sequence of  <dig> aa at the n-terminal half and several different domains throughout the sequence. the bro gene family has been divided into four groups based on the similarity of those domains  <cit> . six of the lyxymnpv bro genes, including ly-bro-b , -h , -j , -k , -l  and -n  which are homologues of ld-bro-b, -j, -b, -p, -n and -p, respectively, belong to group i, while three bros  belong to group ii. four of them, including ly-bro-c , -d , -e , and -f  which are homologues of ld-bro-c, -c, -c and -d, respectively, belong to group iii. only one bro  belongs to group iv. the homologues of ld-bro-f, -h, -i, -k, -l and -m are not presented in lyxymnpv genome. however, in lyxymnpv, all group iii bro genes encode small fragments of truncated protein . ly-bro-c, ly-bro-d and ly-bro-e are homologous to different regions of ld-bro-c, but ly-bro-f is homologous to the n-terminal portion of ld-bro-d.

homologous regions 
a novel feature of many baculovirus genomes is the presence of homologous regions  located throughout the genome  <cit> . a single hr comprises a palindrome that is usually flanked by direct repeats and is closely related to counterparts located elsewhere in the genome. according to the transient replication assays, hrs may play a role in the replication origins of npvs and gvs  <cit>  and function as enhancers of rna polymerase ii-mediated transcription of baculovirus early promoters in npvs  <cit> . it has been suggested that hrs can probably substitute for each other. however, it was recently shown that no single homologous repeat region is essential for dna replication of acmnpv  <cit> .

the lyxymnpv genome contains thirteen homologous repeat regions  that include two to seven palindrome repeats for a total of  <dig> repeats  and account for  <dig> % of the genome. of these hrs, hr <dig> and hr <dig> are in the reverse direction compared to other hrs in the lyxymnpv genome . similar to the ldmnpv palindrome sequence  <cit> , the lyxymnpv hr palindrome consensus ggccgrcacgtaaaattctacgcgtccgcc shows 24/ <dig> palindrome matches  and the palindromic consensus sequence includes five highly variable positions . all nucleotides in the palindrome are > <dig> % conserved, except for the eighteenth nucleotide , and with the variable nucleotides being 50%-77% conserved. in addition, the acmnpv consensus hr palindrome has 50% sequence identity with lyxymnpv consensus hr sequence .

the genomic positions of lyxymnpv regions hr <dig> - hr <dig> are conserved with the genomic positions of ldmnpv hr <dig> - hr <dig>  <cit> . lyxymnpv hr <dig>  hr3a, hr3c, hr <dig> and hr <dig> are flanked by the same orfs as those in the ldmnpv genome  and lyxymnpv hr <dig>  hr8b and hr8c are flanked by the same orfs as ldmnpv hr <dig>  hr7d and hr <dig>  respectively . major insertions and deletions were found near the lyxymnpv hr <dig> and hr3b. therefore, lyxymnpv hr <dig> is flanked by lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig>  and hr3b is flanked by lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig>   . conversely, ldmnpv hr7a, hr7b and hr7c are not present in the corresponding locations in the lyxymnpv . as reported in other comparisons of closely related viruses, orf content tends to differ markedly between ldmnpv and lyxymnpv around the hr <dig>  hr8a and hr <dig>  lyxymnpv hr <dig> is located between lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig> , hr8a is located between lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig>  and hr <dig> is located between lyxy <dig>  and lyxy <dig>  . it is notable that in the region from lyxy <dig> to lyxy <dig>  between hr <dig> and hr <dig> showed a reverse gene arrangement compared to those of ldmnpv .

the positions of at least some hrs appear to be conserved relative to specific baculovirus genes. in particular, it was found that an hr is conserved immediately downstream of ac <dig> and the homologous genes in bmnpv  <cit> , opmnpv  <cit>  and ldmnpv  <cit> . lyxymnpv hr <dig> is located immediately downstream of lyxy <dig> , the lyxymnpv homologue of ac <dig> . in addition, similar to ldmnpv, because no homologue of the acmnpv orfs  are present in the lyxymnpv genome, lyxy <dig> is located immediately downstream of this hr, which is the homologue of acmnpv vp <dig> . this indicates that the position of lyxymnpv hr <dig> is conserved with regard to both the upstream and downstream genes. the orf organisation downstream of this hr in opmnpv, bmnpv  <cit>  and ldmnpv is similar to lyxymnpv. homologues of ac84-ac <dig> are missing in bmnpv, while ac <dig> and ac <dig> are missing in opmnpv. given that hrs share higher similarity within a virus strain than any hrs between species, this evidence further indicates that hrs play a fundamental role in viral life cycle and replication process appears to be tightly linked to functional conservation.

lyxymnpv duplicate genes
two pairs of genes, lyxy45/lyxy <dig> and lyxy50/lyxy <dig>  were identified as duplicated homologues of ld <dig> and ld <dig> in the lyxymnpv genome. all of these duplicate genes show low identities to each other . however, ly45/ly <dig> has higher identity  from amino acid positions  <dig> to the  <dig>  while lyxy50/lyxy <dig> has higher identy  from amino acid  <dig> to the  <dig>  of these duplicate genes, lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> have low identities to ld <dig>  and ld <dig> , respectively but lyxy <dig> with the c-terminal portion consisting of  <dig> amino acids has over 75% identity to ld <dig>  however, both lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> are 13% identical to the homologues of ldmnpv.

unique lyxymnpv orfs
four genes are unique in the lyxymnpv genome, including lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig>  lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> . most of these orfs are small in size , with the exception of lyxy <dig> . only lyxy <dig> contain a recognisable promoter. lyxy <dig> possesses a late gene promoter motif and an enhancer-like element. those orfs with no recognisable promoter may not be transcribed, but lyxy <dig> may be transcribed during the early or late stages of infection and could be contributing factor in host range expansion and some pathology of lyxymnpv. both lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> have no baculovirus homologue and no significant blast database hit. lyxy <dig> and lyxy <dig> however have at least one significant blast database hit. lyxy <dig> had a 32% identity match to  <dig> aa of a hypothetical protein  of the fungal species cryptococcus neoformans . interestingly, lyxy <dig> had a 31% identity match to  <dig> aa of drosophila melanogaster gag protein  , which shows some homology, albeit low  to full length of d. melanogaster and b. mori , and it has also been identified in the highly repetitive elements  of the gypsy moth    <cit> . in retroviruses, the gag gene encodes structural proteins and will be primarily translated as gag precursor that acts to generate structural proteins of the mature infectious virus. all retroviruses have at least three mature gag proteins that are generically referred to as matrix  protein, capsid  protein, and nucleocapsid  protein  <cit> . however, as mentioned above, the gag gene of lyxymnpv has no recognizable promoter so it may not be transcribed and therefore may not contribute to the encapsidation of lyxymnpv.

phylogenetic analysis of lyxymnpv
the neighbour-joining  and maximum parsimony  trees generated similar results, but the nj tree revealed higher bootstrap values. the results reflect the current systematic assignment of the viruses. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the family baculoviridae consists of five major clades: the npvs infecting lepidoptera , the gvs, the hymenopteran-specific npvs and cuninpv. two subclades within the lepidopteran npv group ii resemble the ldmnpv and adhonpv lineages as reported by oliveira et al.  <cit> . the result indicated that lyxymnpv and ldmnpv are grouped together. these results correspond to our previous studies  <cit>  and indicate that lyxymnpv is a baculovirus distinct from ldmnpv but the two are closely related based on the pairwise distances of the nucleotide sequences of polh, lef- <dig> and lef- <dig>  <cit> .

comparison of lyxymnpv to ldmnpv
the most significant difference between lyxymnpv and ldmnpv is a large genomic fragment  of lyxymnpv that includes  <dig> orfs and one hr, which range from lyxy <dig>  to lyxy <dig>  and are inverted compared to those of ldmnpv . the lyxymnpv genome is  <dig> bp smaller than the ldmnpv genome and contains six fewer orfs. lyxymnpv contains six orfs that are absent in ldmnpv , whereas ldmnpv contains  <dig> orfs that are absent in lyxymnpv, namely rr <dig>  rr2a, and ctl- <dig>  as mentioned previously . lyxymnpv and ldmnpv share  <dig> orfs  with unknown functions, and the homologues of these genes are not present in the other baculoviruses. these shared genes range from  <dig> to  <dig> aa in lyxymnpv, and  <dig> of them contain recognisable promoters. it is possible that these genes are host range genes that are involved specifically in lyxymnpv or other npv infection in ld cells or other lymantria species. there are  <dig> orfs in common between lyxymnpv and ldmnpv, and their order is mostly identical. several of these orfs are of different lengths, as shown in additional file  <dig>  these genes include p <dig>  dbp <dig>  bro-c to -f, bro-m, vp91/p <dig>  vp <dig>  egt, pif- <dig>  arif- <dig> and odv-e <dig> as well as other genes of unassigned functions. the hrs of lyxymnpv are not all in the same position and contain different numbers and orientations of repeat units compared to ldmnpv. the differences in gene content, orf length and hr are possible candidates for regulators of the different degree of virulence exhibited by the two similar species  <cit> , and it might be the same case between lyxymnpv and ldmnpv, and even ldmnpv-like virus.

there are three lymantriidae-derived npv species, including lyxymnpv, ldmnpv and opmnpv, which have a common in vitro host cell, the ld cell line  <cit> . comparing further the lyxymnpv gene content to those of ldmnpv and opmnpv, we found that these three npvs shared  <dig> orfs ; three of these genes were absent in the acmnpv genome, namely lyxy116/op35/ld <dig> , lyxy137/op34/ld <dig> , and lyxy141/op31/ld <dig> . of these three genes, iap- <dig> is one of the baculovirus genes that affect the viral host range and prevent apoptosis in baculovirus-infected cells  <cit> . in opmnpv, op-iap <dig> could rescue acmnpv mutants lacking p <dig> from induced ld cell apoptosis  <cit> . silencing of op-iap <dig> during the opmnpv infection of ld cells induces apoptosis  <cit> . these data support a possibly important role for iap- <dig> during the early stage of baculovirus infection in ld cells.

however, ldmnpv and opmnpv have  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, with no homologues in the lyxymnpv genome. among them, an important gene, hrf- <dig> , that is involved in baculoviral host range and infectivity was not found in the lyxymnpv genome . studies on hrf- <dig> revealed that it could promote npv infectivity  of ld cells  <cit> , and recombinant acmnpv bearing hrf- <dig> also exhibited increased infectivity towards helicoverpa zea and l. dispar larvae  <cit> . a new npv species, mavimnpv, which also lacks the hrf- <dig> gene, could infect ld cells with a low infection rate  by its egfp-recombinant virus, but it could not infect ly cells  <cit> .

baculovirus host range likely involves a complicated array of viral and cellular factors. however, through data from genomic analyses, we speculate that hrf- <dig> maybe more important for group-i npvs during infection in ld cells than group-ii npvs. in addition, iap- <dig> from lyxymnpv, ldmnpv and opmnpv may be an important factor during npv infection in ld cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, lyxymnpv showed a high degree of colinearity and sequence identity with ldmnpv. however, these two viruses came from different geographical locations. the results of our previous studies and previous in vitro infection assay revealed that lyxymnpv could be propagated in both ly and ld cell lines. furthermore, the genome sequence analysis revealed that lyxymnpv lacks hrf- <dig>  thus, the genes that are involved in the host range expansion of lyxymnpv and ldmnpv are very interesting and worth further study. lyxymnpv was highly virulent to l. xylina larvae, which suggests that it could be a promising agent for inclusion in i.p.m. programs for the biological control of l. xylina in taiwan.
