BACKGROUND
the differentiation of naïve t cells into an activated memory phenotype is characterized by an extensive change in the expression of trafficking determinants, resulting in the acquisition of homing receptors that enable the cells to migrate from the circulation into peripheral tissues. this change in t cell homing potential is affected by the microenvironment where initial antigen recognition occurred, as memory t cells preferentially return to regions of the body similar to those where the initial antigen was encountered  <cit> . for instance, studies in mice have demonstrated that cd4+ t cells activated in cutaneous lymph nodes upregulate trafficking determinants specific for the skin, such as p-selectin ligand, while t cells responding to antigen in intestinal lymph nodes express high levels the gut-associated adhesion molecule integrin α4β <dig> and acquire responsiveness to the intestinal cc-chemokine ligand ccl <dig>  <cit> . the specific profile of adhesion molecules and chemoattractant receptors expressed by individual t cells allows the cells to interact with the vascular endothelium at anatomical sites where the cognate ligands are selectively expressed, targeting the cells to specific tissues  <cit> . the relevance of such interactions has been amply demonstrated in humans, where postcapillary venules in the inflamed skin selectively express e-selectin and ccl <dig>  while lamina propria of the small intestines displays the mucosal addressin madcam- <dig> and ccl <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, t cells isolated from the small intestines and the skin are almost completely dichotomous in their expression of trafficking determinants; t cells from the skin express cutaneous leukocyte antigen  and ccr <dig>  but lack integrin α4β <dig>  while t cells from the small intestines are positive for α4β <dig>  but not cla or ccr <dig>  <cit> . consequently, circulating t cells can be divided into tissue specific subsets, each of which have the ability to traffic through certain tissue compartments, but which are excluded from others.

while trafficking of t cells to the skin and gut is well characterized, less is known about the mechanisms governing homing of t cells across the choroid plexus into the csf during immune surveillance of the healthy brain  <cit> . although it has been hypothesized that such csf-specific trafficking determinants exist, their molecular specificity has been evasive. some progress has been made in defining trafficking determinants for inflamed cns microvessels: cd8+ t cells activated in cervical lymph nodes draining intracerebral tumors in the mouse acquire a phenotype characterized by high expression of the two integrins α <dig> and α <dig> as well as a modest increase in the expression of p-selectin ligand  <cit> . functional data supports a role for p-selectin/e-selectin and their ligands  as well as integrin α4β <dig>  in extravasation of lymphocytes in the cns during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , but the relevance of these findings for trafficking of t cells across non-inflamed vessels during immune surveillance of the healthy brain remains unclear  <cit> . t cells in the csf of healthy individuals or patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases  are characterized by high expression of integrin αlβ <dig> , α4β <dig>  ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  <cit> , a phenotype they share with activated t cells isolated from a wide range of other organs  <cit> . therapeutic α4-integrin blockade suppressed access of several cell types  into csf  <cit> , identifying the first functional csf entry determinant for human lymphocytes.

in this study we addressed the expression of trafficking determinants known to be involved in organ-specific trafficking to the skin  and the small intestines  on csf t cells from patients with nind. we reasoned that any bias in cd4+ t cell expression of these known organ-specific trafficking determinants in the csf might aid in identifying cns-specific adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors. by contrast, equal presence of tissue-committed t cells in the blood and csf would indicate that memory t cells enter csf according to their activation or differentiation state but possibly not by specific homing molecules. we observed comparable frequencies of cd4+ memory t cells displaying cla and ccr <dig> as well as integrin α4β <dig> and ccr <dig> in paired blood and csf samples. the results demonstrated that, in contrast to most other tissues, skin- and gut-homing t cells are not excluded from the csf, suggesting that the recruitment of cd4+ t cells to the cns is more related to previous antigen exposure and activation than to the expression of an organ-specific adhesion molecule or chemokine receptor. although negative with regard to roles for ccr9/α4β <dig> or ccr4/cla, for csf homing, the results carry implications for the use of novel immunotherapeutic strategies to treat neurological diseases. in particular, several new techniques for treating diverse neurological disorders require the generation of neuroantigen-specific t cells by peripheral administration of antigen either subcutaneously or to the gastrointestinal mucosa. our current results indicate that skin- and gut-homing memory t cells readily access the cns compartment, providing a rationale for the feasibility of such strategies.

RESULTS
cd4+ memory t cells expressing cla and integrin α4β <dig> are present in the csf
flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of cla and integrin α4β <dig>  two adhesion molecules involved in the selective recruitment of t cells to the skin and gut, respectively , on t cells in paired blood and csf samples from four nind patients. since many trafficking determinants are differentially expressed on naïve and memory t cells and csf contains predominantly cd4+ t cells, of which almost all display a phenotype consistent with previously activated memory cells  <cit> , we compared the expression of cla and integrin α4β <dig> on cd4+/cd45ra- cells . the majority of cd4+/cd45ra- t cells in the csf did not express either cla or integrin α4β <dig> . discrete subpopulations of cd4+/cd45ra- t cells expressing either cla  or integrin α4β <dig>  were, however, detected in the csf. interestingly, the pattern of cla and integrin α4β <dig> expression on cd4+/cd45ra- memory t cells in the csf was strikingly similar to peripheral blood , demonstrating that skin- and gut-homing t cells are not excluded from the cns compartment.

expression of ccr <dig> on csf t cells
next, we assessed csf expression of ccr <dig>  a chemokine receptor highly expressed by skin-homing t cells  <cit> . due to technical reasons, we used the presence of cd45ro to determine the population of memory cd4+ t cells for all ccr <dig> stainings . ccr <dig> was expressed by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of cd4+/cd45ro+ memory t cells in the csf from patients with nind . consistent with a shared homing profile to the skin, a majority of cla+ memory t cells in the csf co-expressed ccr <dig>  but some ccr <dig> staining could be detected also on cla- memory t cells . numbers of ccr4+/cd4+/cd45ro+ t cells in the csf were slightly lower than in paired blood samples , but this difference was not statistically significant .

nind = non-inflammatory neurological diseases; ms = multiple sclerosis; cla = cutaneous leukocyte antigen

since ccr <dig> has been associated with a th <dig> phenotype  <cit> , csf levels of ccr <dig> were analyzed in six patients with multiple sclerosis , a disease associated with th <dig> responses in the cns  <cit> . ms patients had slightly lower numbers of ccr4+/cd4+/cd45ro+ t cells in the csf compared to paired blood samples , but ccr <dig> was still expressed by approximately 50% of all cd4+/cd45ro+ t cells in the csf. by carefully analyzing the profile of chemokine receptors on th <dig> and th <dig> cells, it has been demonstrated that th <dig> cells predominantly are ccr4+/cxcr3-, while the population of ccr4+/cxcr3+ memory t cells not is enriched for th <dig> cells  <cit> . we observed that a majority of ccr4+ memory t cells in the csf co-expressed cxcr <dig> and that the numbers of ccr4+/cxcr3- "true" th <dig> cells in the csf were low .

the expression of ccr <dig> on csf t cells was assessed using two different anti-ccr <dig> mabs, clones 328b and 1g <dig>  preliminary experiments demonstrated that clone 328b resulted in a distinct staining of csf t cells as described above, whereas clone 1g <dig> failed to detect any ccr4+ t cells in the csf . to confirm the expression of ccr <dig> on csf t cells, rna was isolated from csf cells obtained from one patient with mononuclear pleiocytosis during the follow-up after postinfectious myelitis. using real-time rt-pcr, we were able to verify that csf mononuclear cells expressed ccr <dig> mrna at slightly higher levels compared to pbmcs from the same individual .

preliminary stainings showed that ccr <dig>  another chemokine receptor expressed by skin-homing t cells  <cit> , was only expressed by a negligible percentage of cd4+ memory t cells both in blood and csf and was thus not investigated closer .

ccr <dig> expression on csf t cells
finally, the expression of ccr <dig>  associated with homing of t cells to the intestines  <cit> , was examined in the csf. ccr <dig> was expressed by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of cd4+/cd45ra- memory t cells in the csf from patients with nind, a frequency that was almost identical to peripheral blood . as expected, ccr <dig> expression was predominantly detected on cd4+/cd45ra- t cells co-expressing integrin β <dig> both in blood and csf . since the β <dig> subunit can dimerize not only with α <dig>  but also with integrin αe , we stained csf cells using an antibody against αe to exclude that ccr <dig> was associated with integrin αeβ <dig> in the csf. virtually no cd4+/cd45ra- t cells in the csf were, however, positive for αe , confirming that gut-homing ccr9/α4β <dig> double positive memory t cells are present in the csf.

discussion
this study demonstrated that cd4+ memory t cells in the csf exhibit a distinctly different expression pattern of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors compared to most tissue-infiltrating t cell populations. it is well established that t cells isolated from the small intestines and the skin are nearly homogenously positive for mutually exclusive pairs of trafficking determinants; almost all t cells from the skin express cla and ccr <dig>  but lack integrin α4β <dig> or ccr <dig>  while t cells from the small intestines are positive for integrin α4β <dig> and ccr <dig>  but not cla or ccr <dig>  <cit> . this highly polarized pattern is believed to result from selective recruitment of t cells expressing the appropriate trafficking determinants from a pool of tissue-committed and non-committed t cells in the systemic circulation. it is plausible that additional tissue-committed t cell populations exist, since t cells from most other tissue compartments, including bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid and liver, do not express cla, integrin α4β <dig>  ccr <dig> or ccr <dig>  suggesting that hitherto unknown combinations of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors mediate organ-specific homing to these organs  <cit> . csf from nind patients contained, on the contrary, comparable numbers of cd4+ memory t cells expressing trafficking determinants specific for the skin  and the small intestines  as paired samples from peripheral blood. even though percentages of cd4+ memory t cells expressing ccr <dig> and integrin α4β <dig> were slightly lower in csf compared to blood, the results demonstrate that skin- and gut-homing t cells access the csf. these findings argue that t cell homing to the csf is characterized by recruitment of a wide spectrum of tissue-specific t cell subpopulations. aside from the established role of α4-integrin  <cit> , the trafficking determinants involved in csf trafficking remain to be defined.

these results address a key question regarding the feasibility of several experimental therapies for neurological conditions utilizing antigenic stimulation in the periphery  to produce a population of t cells, which are intended to act in the cns. such therapies include peripheral immunization against a-beta for alzheimer's disease  <cit> , sensitization with self antigens to generate myelin-reactive t cells for the amelioration of spinal contusion and neurodegeneration  <cit> , as well as injection of altered peptide ligands  <cit>  and oral administration of myelin to induce tolerance for the treatment of ms  <cit> . in recent years, such innovative approaches have been assessed in experimental animal models and in clinical trials, with provocative results  <cit> .

to our knowledge, the only other tissue compartment besides csf, which contains tissue-committed t cells specific for a different compartment is synovial fluid. analogous to the present observations, synovial fluid from patients with arthritis contained comparable numbers of cd4+ memory t cells expressing cla, integrin α4β <dig> and ccr <dig> as peripheral blood  <cit> . both csf and synovial fluid are sterile tissue fluids and the pathways for immune surveillance of such fluids may be different from the parenchyma itself. it has generally been assumed that cells in the csf are derived from the brain parenchyma and reflect processes ongoing in the tissue compartment. recent intravital microscopy studies have, however, demonstrated that leukocyte migration through the blood-brain barrier surrounding deep parenchymal vessels of the brain is an uncommon event in the non-inflamed murine brain  <cit> , while fluorescently labeled splenocytes readily were detected in the meninges and choroid plexus within two hours after adoptive transfer  <cit> . vasculature in the choroid plexus and meninges, but not in the non-inflamed human brain, express adhesion molecules supporting interactions with circulating leukocytes, suggesting that activated memory t cells may enter the csf directly from the systemic circulation as part of immune surveillance of the cns  <cit> . it is conceivable that in addition to the well characterized pathways of organ-specific homing to tissues in direct contact with the outside environment such as skin and gut, there may be distinct mechanisms controlling homing of antigen-experienced lymphocytes to sterile tissue fluids. the majority of cns infections are derived from pathogens, which initially entered the body through mucosal sites or the skin, rendering it likely that memory t cells primed in these locations may mount the appropriate intrathecal immune response. in contrast, pathogens causing infections in the skin or the intestines are predominantly locally derived and a compartmentalized immune response may under these circumstances be phylogenetically beneficial.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that cla+/ccr4+ and α4β7+/ccr9+ memory t cells are present in the csf during immune surveillance of the cns. homing of t cells to the csf during immune surveillance may be more tuned to distinguish between naïve and antigen-experienced t cells than among various tissue-specialized memory t cell populations. the ready access of skin- and gut-homing cd4+ t cells to the cns compartment via csf provide a rationale for the use of immunotherapeutic strategies, such as oral tolerance or therapeutic immunization, where immunogens are administered using an oral or subcutaneous route.
