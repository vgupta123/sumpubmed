BACKGROUND
the cytochrome p450s  have widespread and diverse functions in animals. cyps in families 1â€“ <dig> are critical and often inducible components of the phase i detoxification systems of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants  <cit> . they are also important in lipid metabolism, including fatty acids, retinoids, eicosanoids, steroids, vitamin d and bile acids, and some are regulated in a sexually dimorphic fashion through endocrine mechanisms  <cit> . in addition, the cyp <dig> family contributes to maintenance of sharp retinoic acid boundaries between rhombomeres in the developing mammalian embryo and in the eye  <cit> . in insects cyps are essential to the function of sensory organs such as antennae, where they may be involved in odorant clearance  <cit> .

cyps are important in the metabolism of and tolerance to anthropogenic chemicals  <cit>  and plant allelochemicals  <cit> . inducibility, constitutive overexpression, and genomic studies investigating quantitative trait loci  mapping have demonstrated tolerance or resistance to environmental chemicals due to cyps  <cit> . furthermore, it has been hypothesized that pesticide sensitivity in honeybee is associated with reduced cyp numbers  <cit> . in addition, hormone structure is dependent on cyps  <cit> , and therefore small differences in the hormones utilized  may be dependent on the cyps available or the timing of expression.

daphnia pulex, commonly known as the waterflea, is the first crustacean to have its genome sequenced. d. pulex has a genome of approximately  <dig> mb with  <dig>  genes . daphnid species are globally distributed zooplankton, in the order branchiopoda, suborder cladocera, and there are several daphnid species, including daphnia magna, daphnia pulicaria, daphnia pulex, and ceriodaphnia dubia. daphnids are commonly studied zooplankton because of their importance to aquatic ecosystems, ability to contend with environmental challenges, amenability to culture, short life-cycle, and parthenogenic reproduction. furthermore, daphnids are commonly used in several toxicity tests for multiple applications. studies on the daphnia pulex genome and specifically the cyps may provide important insight on how genome and gene expression alterations promote individual and population-level fitness following environmental change.

it has become clear in the genomic era that previous estimates for the number of cyps in daphnids such as d. magna  <cit>  was a gross underestimate, and that most metazoans have a large number of cyp genes. for example, humans have  <dig>  mice have  <dig>  stronglyocentrotus purpuratus  have  <dig>  anopheles gambiae  have  <dig>  and drosophila melanogaster have  <dig> functional cyps . in continuation of this p <dig> research, we are working with the daphnia genomics consortium to assemble, annotate, and compare the cyps in the daphnia pulex genome with several other species. we have also assigned names to all of the cyps and cyp pseudogenes based on previously published rules using phylogenetic trees and amino acid sequence identity to determine clan, family and subfamily membership  <cit> . clans represent the deepest diverging gene clades in the cyp nomenclature. there are ten p <dig> clans among animals, but only four are present in the protostomes: cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and mitochondrial. the general web repository for p <dig> nomenclature and sequence data is . overall, this work provides a continuation of earlier projects to comprehensively annotate cyps and determine the putative role of daphnia pulex cyps in sensory adaptation, sensitivity to toxicants, adaptation to environmental challenges, and as biomarkers of chemical or endocrine stimulation.

RESULTS
manual annotation
manual annotation and curation of the cyps in daphnia pulex v <dig>  draft genome sequence assembly  produced  <dig> full length p450s and three pseudogenes. in addition, there are two ests in the cyp <dig> clan that were not found in the d. pulex genome of the chosen parthenogenic individual, but partial sequences  were observed previously in specific d. pulex ecotypes  <cit> . overall, this number is similar to other cyp genomes , but slightly lower than the typical invertebrate or insect with the exception of honeybee  <cit> .

the daphnia pulex full length cyps are divided into four distinct clans; mitochondrial, cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  the same clans that are found in insects  <cit> . the four clans can be further subdivided into  <dig> families,  <dig> subfamilies, and  <dig> putatively functional isoforms, and  <dig> pseudogenes . the phylogenetic tree in combination with the previously described rules for naming cyps  were used to name the different cyps in d. pulex  <cit> . six new cyp families were discovered; mitochondrial clan families cyp <dig> and  <dig>  cyp <dig> clan families cyp <dig> and  <dig>  and cyp <dig> clan families cyp <dig> and  <dig> .

phylogenetic tree
bayesian inference and maximum parsimony yielded nearly identical topologies, so we have presented the tree in which branch lengths are proportional to the amount of change occurring in each lineage . this tree is also available in a detailed, expandable, readable pdf document as supplementary material . the bayesian tree includes posterior probabilities at nodes which reflect the proportion of trees sampled during the search that included each particular node. the sea anemone genome has not been manually curated and therefore the data are subject to potential assembly errors until validated. however, the sea anemone provides an ancient anthozoan class cnidarian, and more importantly a diploblast, to the analysis as the only non-triploblastic species in our phylogenetic tree. the honeybee and fruitfly provide a protostome insect cyp genome for comparison, while the human cyps provide a deuterostome for comparison to the branchiopod crustacean, d. pulex.

in general, the tree shows six distinct monophyletic clades, all but one supported by posterior probabilities of  <dig> . these include the mitochondrial, cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> clans, and two deep branches that do not include any arthropod cyps. the non-arthropod lineages are nearly deuterostome exclusive and would be if not for the two anemone cyps that show their closest relationships to cyp <dig>  these anemone cyps found nested within a vertebrate lineage indicate that a cyp26-like ancestor may have existed in cnidarians but was lost in protostomes. similar inferences concerning cyp loss in protostomes have already been made about cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and possibly cyp <dig>  the history of cyp <dig> in protostomes may be complex since an ortholog has been detected in the annelid leech haementeria depressa . in addition, cyp <dig>  clusters with the cyp <dig> and mitochondrial clans, and cyp <dig> and related sea anemone cyps are part of a sister clade to the cyp <dig> clan .

overall, the tree demonstrates that the four major clans found in insects  encompass all of the cyps in d. pulex. an excel table of each of the cyp genes and pseudogenes found in the daphnia pulex genome, their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and links to their scaffold position is available as supplementary material .

the mitochondrial clan of d. pulex contains six members in five families and five subfamilies. three of the members are highly conserved halloween genes involved in ecdysone synthesis  <cit> . specifically, disembodied , shade , and shadow  are all mitochondrial cyps involved in the last three steps of 20-hydroxyecdysone  synthesis. cyp314a <dig> is the cyp required for the conversion of ecdysone to its active form, 20-he  <cit> . the other three cyps are divided into two new families cyp <dig>  and cyp363a <dig>  indicating that these cyps are not as well conserved and probably have taken on new roles. a tree of the mitochondrial cyp clan is available as supplementary material .

the cyp <dig> clan of d. pulex contains  <dig> members, including one pseudogene , separated into five distinct families  and six subfamilies. two of the genes, phantom  and spook  are conserved halloween genes involved in the early stages of ecdysone synthesis  <cit> . the exact role of cyp307a <dig> in ecdysone biosynthesis is unknown, but appears to be part of the "black box" of reactions involved in the earlier steps of ecdysone synthesis from cholesterol. daphnia pulex only contains one cyp <dig> gene similar to sequenced lepidopterans, but different than drosophila that use two cyp <dig> genes at different stages of their lifecycle  <cit> . interestingly, the cyp <dig> genes are a sister group to the non-arthropod cyp <dig> members .

the other three cyp2-clan families in d. pulex  are divided into four subfamilies and contain  <dig> genes. interestingly, a sister-group in the cyp <dig> clan contains no arthropod cyps. this group primarily contains anemone cyps, but also contains cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and the cyp <dig> family members inducible by chlorinated hydrocarbons in vertebrates  <cit> . the cyp <dig> family is the largest of the cyp2-clan families, containing  <dig> members with  <dig> members in the 370a subfamily and  <dig> members in the 370b subfamily . there is also one pseudogene in the cyp370a subfamily, cyp370a3p.

the daphnia cyp <dig> family is greatly expanded relative to the single gene cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families in insects it most closely resembles. cyp15a <dig> is a regio- and stereo-specific epoxidase critical in the formation of juvenile hormone iii  from methyl farnesoate in the corpora allata of the cockroach  <cit> . however, methyl farnesoate, a juvenile hormone precursor, is considered the major terpenoid hormone in crustaceans  <cit> ; therefore, a methyl farnesoate epoxidase is unnecessary and it is unlikely that the cyp370a and cyp370b subfamily members specifically perform this function. the role of the cyp <dig> family in daphnia is currently unknown. cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> are both close relatives of cyp <dig> , suggesting potential involvement in ecdysone synthesis or catabolism . the cyp <dig> family is a new family that contains three genes . cyp <dig>  which is also found in insects, is induced by 20-he in drosophila  <cit> .

the cyp <dig> clan consists of numerous cyps involved in detoxification of xenobiotics and endobiotics  <cit> . some cyp <dig> clan members are inducible by hormones such as progesterone  <cit>  and ecdysone  <cit> , and are responsible for the metabolism and elimination of steroid hormones in vertebrates  <cit> . although the posterior probability at the base of the cyp <dig> clan is low , this only reflects the uncertainly of the position of the first two drosophila lineages at the base of the cyp <dig> clan. the cyp <dig> clade is strongly supported when drosophila is not included in the analysis . in daphnia pulex, the cyp <dig> clan contains  <dig> genes and one pseudogene, arranged into two new families  and three subfamilies. eleven of these thirteen genes are in the cyp360a subfamily leaving just cyp361a <dig> and cyp361b <dig> outside this subfamily in the cyp <dig> clan of d. pulex. the closest relatives of the cyp <dig> subfamily in the tree are the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> subfamily members of insects involved in endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. similarly, the closest relatives of the two cyp <dig> subfamily members are the anemone cyp3-like group, and the human cyp3a and cyp5a subfamily members involved in detoxification and thromboxane a <dig> biosynthesis. in general, the cyp <dig> clan in insect species has more cyps than the daphnia pulex cyp <dig> clan. most cyp families in insects have only a few members, but the cyp6as subfamily has  <dig> members,  <dig> % of the honeybee p450s, and there are  <dig> members of the cyp <dig> clan distributed between seven families making up 42% of the d. melanogaster p450s. the cyp <dig> clan in insects, and in particular the cyp6as subfamily in honeybee was recruited for major gene expansion as were the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families in d. pulex, and to a lesser degree the cyp4c subfamily. a tree of the cyp <dig> clan is available as an additional file .

the cyp <dig> clan, which is the sister-group to a clade containing the cyp <dig> clan plus one of the two "non-arthropod" clans, consists of  <dig> members all in the same family  and arranged into five subfamilies  with 4â€“ <dig> members in each subfamily . there is also a pseudogene in the cyp4c subfamily. two members of the cyp <dig> family were not observed in the daphnia pulex genome v <dig>  draft genome sequence assembly , but were cloned by degenerative pcr in a previous study in which nine cyp <dig> members were partially cloned  <cit> . the two absent cyps, cyp4c <dig>  and cyp4an <dig> , are available on genbank . the d. pulex genome sequence coverage was  <dig> Ã—, therefore our inability to find these two cyps may be due to the known gaps in the genome assembly. it is also possible that these two genes were deleted from the daphnia genomics consortium's chosen parthenogenic d. pulex or "chosen one" due to strain differences.

the cyp <dig> members are considered the least studied of the cyp clans in insects  <cit>  and are involved in fatty acid metabolism, including inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites, and xenobiotic metabolism in mammals  <cit> . some cyp <dig> members may be involved in sensory perception in insects as they are found in the antenna  <cit> . a cyp4c member is also involved in the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone, and another is inducible by hypertrehalosemic hormone, a key hormone in arthropod carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . furthermore, some cyp <dig> members are down-regulated by ecdysteroids  <cit> , indicating that cyp <dig> members may play a key role in sensory and hormonal functions in d. pulex.

primarily cyp <dig>  but some cyp <dig> and mitochondrial clan members have been associated with resistance to pesticides  <cit> . several cyp <dig> clan members, such as cyp6g <dig> and cyp6a <dig> are associated with ddt or pyrethroid resistance, respectively  <cit> . cyp4d <dig> and other cyp <dig> members in drosophila are inducible by plant alkaloids and may be important in plant host interactions  <cit> . in d. pulex, differential expression of two cyp <dig> genes is associated with resistance to tannic acid and leaf litter  <cit> . cyp4c <dig> expression is much higher in ecotype  <dig> and cyp4ap <dig> shows much higher levels of transcription in ecotype  <dig>  which is exposed to high amounts of leaf litter and polyphenols, and in turn resistant to toxic leaf litters  <cit> . interestingly, the cyps that show differential expression based on ecotype and leaf litter exposure, are the two cyps that are not found within the d. pulex v <dig>  genome sequence assembly. the complete sequence of these two cyps is not available  <cit> .

expansion of the cyp  <dig> and  <dig> clans
a comparison of the number of genes in each of the cyp clans from d. pulex, silkmoth , human , pufferfish , honeybee , sea urchin , and fruitfly  indicates both subtle and demonstrative differences in cyp clan numbers between species . in general, the protostomes  have significantly fewer cyp <dig> clan members than deuterostomes, indicating an expansion of the cyp <dig> clan in deuterostomes . of the protostomes investigated, d. pulex has the greatest percentage of cyp <dig> clan members. the cyp <dig> clan encompasses approximately  <dig> â€“10% of the total cyps in most insects with honeybee the exception at  <dig> % of its cyps in the cyp <dig> clan  <cit> . in contrast, d. pulex has  <dig> cyps in the cyp <dig> clan, nearly double of any sequenced insect , and d. pulex's cyp <dig> clan members encompass  <dig> % of its cyps, indicating a significant expansion of this clan relative to the insects. no other crustacean has been sequenced, so whether the expansion of the cyp <dig> clan is typical of crustaceans is unknown.

the cyp <dig> clan is also slightly expanded in d. pulex relative to the insects. there are  <dig> cyp <dig> members that encompass 49% of the cyps in the genome. the cyp <dig> clan varies from  <dig> â€“42% of the cyp genome in sequenced insects  <cit> . excluding the honeybee, which only has  <dig> cyp <dig> members, the rest of the insect's cyp <dig> members vary from  <dig> â€“42% of the total cyps. relative increases in cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> members in d. pulex leaves a relative reduction in the cyp <dig> clan compared to insects. only  <dig> %  of the members of the d. pulex cyp genome are cyp <dig> clan members; whereas 38â€“61%  of the insect cyps are cyp <dig> clan members.

there are several cyp2-clan members similar in structure to other ecdysone metabolizers . however, the formation of juvenile hormone iii from methyl farnesoate by cyp15a <dig> is unnecessary in crustaceans and d. pulex in turn lacks the cyp15a <dig> gene. in addition, d. pulex lacks the cyp <dig> subfamily members with unknown but putative external sensory development function  <cit> . nevertheless, the cyp <dig> family, which is phylogenetically related to the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families, has expanded dramatically in d. pulex, and this family lacks a specific enzyme with a known function. based on our current knowledge of cyps, the expansion of the cyp <dig> family is probably necessary for responses to environmental stressors such as toxicants, and/or other growth or behavioral stimulators such as plant alkaloid toxins.

tandem repeat regions
tandem duplicates are genes that are within intron distances of each other, nearly identical , and may harbor some interesting biology. gene expansion by tandem duplication is common in p <dig> evolution but the basis for recruitment of a founder gene is not understood. there are several cyp tandem repeat regions in the d. pulex genome . overall,  <dig> of the  <dig>  cyp genes are located within tandem repeats. twenty-eight of the  <dig>  cyp <dig> family members, including cyp4c <dig>  are found in tandem repeat regions, which explain in part the expansion of the cyp <dig> clan in d. pulex. in contrast, the cyp <dig> clan has 69%  of its genes found in tandem repeat regions, including 9/ <dig> of the cyp <dig> family members. however, the cyp <dig> clan is small relative to the insect genomes, thus presence in tandem repeats is not correlated to the size of the clan. lastly, none of the mitochondrial cyps, many of which have specific functions in ecdysone synthesis  <cit> , are members of a tandem repeat region . expansions of conserved endogenous functions are rare and may be selected against. conversely, tandem duplications may indicate diversity in exogenous xenobiotic substrates  <cit> .

the cyp <dig> clan is highly expanded relative to the insects, but only  <dig> of the  <dig> cyp <dig>  clan genes are members of a tandem repeat region. initially, we thought this indicated that tandem repeat regions had little to do with the expansion of the cyp <dig> clan in d. pulex. however, all nine of the tandemly repeated cyp <dig> clan members are in the cyp <dig> family. it is interesting that the rest of the cyp <dig> clan members are not found in tandem repeat regions, and it is tempting to speculate that most d. pulex cyp <dig> clan members, just as many of the mitochondrial cyps, have highly specific functions such as ecdysone biosynthesis. needs for p450s are often met by expansion via tandem duplication leading to gene clusters. this suggests that the cyp <dig> family expanded while under selective pressure. which genes expand may be independent of clan or family membership and depend on substrate specificity required to cope with a new xenobiotic stress. the c. elegans genome has almost half of its p450s in the cyp <dig> clan, yet it only has one mitochondrial clan member, cyp <dig>  insects have expanded the cyp <dig> clan into the large cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families and several spinoff families. deuterostomes have expanded cyp <dig> extensively, while trichoplax adhaeren has only one cyp <dig> clan member .

scaffold  <dig> is especially rich in tandem repeat regions. it contains  <dig> of the  <dig>  cyp genes located in tandem repeats, and  <dig> of these genes are cyp <dig> family members. scaffold  <dig> contains tandem repeats for cyp4an, 4ap, 4bx, and 4by subfamilies. interestingly, a cyp4by subfamily member  is located in the middle of the cyp4an subfamily tandem repeat region. this is unusual as most of the genes adjacent to each other in a tandem repeat belong to the same subfamily. as the genes diversify a single gene cluster may contain multiple subfamilies as in the cyp2abfgst and the cyp4abxz gene clusters in mammals  <cit> . an error could have been made in the annotation of this cyp; however, re-examination of cyp4by <dig> gene provided no evidence of this and this cyp firmly fits in the cyp4by subfamily based on identity and phylogenetic status .

CONCLUSIONS
the cladoceran, d. pulex has a wide range of cyps with the same clans as insects, but with distinct changes in the population of each clan. of note is the expansion of the newly discovered cyp <dig> family. elucidation of the function of the different cyp families and subfamilies will no doubt provide important insight into the ability of d. pulex to respond to environmental changes, predator-prey relationships, hormonal changes, plant allelochemicals, and sensory stimuli. ultimately, the understanding of the evolution of animals will require deciphering the history of the p450s and the daphnia genome may contribute to unraveling molecular aspects of the ecology and physiology of this commonly used crustacean species.
