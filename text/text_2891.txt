BACKGROUND
non-coding rnas  are a set of rnas that have no capacity to code for proteins. they are used to be considered as inconsequential transcriptional “noises”, because of limited information for their functions  <cit> . however, this situation is being changed. recent studies have shown that ncrnas play important regulatory roles in numerous biological processes  <cit> .

ncrnas are grouped into small rnas, such as micrornas  and small interfering rnas , and long non-coding rnas  according to the length  <cit> . lncrnas are defined as a group of ncrnas that have a length of more than  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . they are usually expressed at low levels and lacking sequence similarities among species, exhibit tissue and cell-specific expression patterns, and transcripts are localized to subcellular compartments  <cit> . lncrnas can be further grouped into sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic and intergenic lncrnas according to their relative locations with protein-coding genes  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, > <dig> % of lncrnas are intergenic, and antisense lncrnas are also abundant  <cit> .

it has been shown that some lncrnas regulate the expression of genes in a close proximity  or in a distance  in the genome via a number of mechanisms, including modifying promoter activities by nucleosome repositioning, histone modifications, dna methylation, activating/gathering/transporting of accessory proteins, epigenetic silencing and repression  <cit> . increasing evidence supports that lncrnas play a crucial role in disease occurrence, genomic imprinting and developmental regulation in mammals .

in contrast to extensive studies of lncrnas in mammals  <cit> , only a few studies have been reported of the function of lncrnas in plants  <cit> . for example, coolair and coldair have been identified to be associated with flowering locus c  in arabidopsis. coldair includes two antisense lncrnas transcribed from the antisense strand of flc, while coldair is an intronic lncrna transcribed from the first intron of flc. they have been implicated in silencing and epigenetic repression of flc to regulate flowering time  <cit> . atips <dig> and at <dig> have been shown to act as target mimics of mir <dig> by binding and sequestering mir <dig> and reduce mir399-mediated cleavage of pho <dig> which is important for phosphate uptake  <cit> . genome-wide identification of lncrnas in a. thaliana has been reported in several studies . in rice, ldmar has been shown to regulate photoperiod-sensitive male sterility  <cit> . bioinformatics analyses reveal that  <dig> % of lncrnas are precursors of small rnas and  <dig> % of lncrnas are expressed in a tissue-specific manner .

medicago truncatula is a model legume widely used in genomics, genetics and physiological studies of legumes due to its small genome size and relative ease in genetic transformation  <cit> . legumes account for one third of primary crop production in the word and are important sources of dietary proteins for human and animals  <cit> . in m. truncatula, enod <dig> and mt <dig> involved in nodulation and phosphate uptake, respectively, have been identified as lncrnas  <cit> . although a recent in silico analysis of lncrnas has been conducted in m. truncatula, only limited information is presented, because only lncrnas with poly tails have been analyzed, using less finished genome sequences available at the time  <cit> . as most lncrnas have no poly tails and are lowly and specifically expressed  <cit> , to identify a comprehensive set of lncrnas including non-poly-tailed lncrnas in m. truncatula, we conducted genome-wide high-throughput sequencing of six libraries prepared using complementary sequences of synthetic adaptors. similar to other plant species, legumes are also frequently encountered adverse environments such as osmotic and salt stresses. previous studies of molecular mechanisms underlying plant’s tolerance to abiotic stresses are mainly focused on functional studies of protein-coding genes, while few studies have systemically investigated the roles of lncrnas in osmotic and salt stress responses of plants. in the present study, we identified a comprehensive set of lncrnas that are responsive to osmotic and salt stresses in leaves and roots of m. truncatula using high throughput sequencing of six cdna libraries.

RESULTS
physiological response to osmotic and salt stress
materials used to construct cdna libraries were treated by osmotic or salt stress for  <dig> h. foliar osmolality was increased from  <dig> mosmol kg− <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> mosmol kg− <dig>  after the treatments with osmotic and salt stress, respectively . there was a significant increase in foliar na+ concentration after 5-h salt treatment . no effects of osmotic and salt stress on concentrations of proline  and soluble sugars were detected . these results suggest that plants under our treatment regime are at the early stage of stress-response to activate genes and their regulatory networks.table  <dig> the physiological response of leaves after osmotic or salt stress for  <dig> h

high-throughput sequencing
six cdna libraries were constructed using mrna isolated from leaves and roots of m. truncatula seedlings treated with osmotic stress , salt stress , and control  and complementary sequences of synthetic adaptors. they were sequenced by an illumina-solexa sequencer. the high-throughput sequencing led to more than  <dig> , <dig> raw sequence reads. to assess the quality of rna-seq data, each base in the reads was assigned a quality score  by a phred-like algorithm using the fastqc  <cit> . the analysis revealed that the data are highly credible with a mean q-value of  <dig> . of the raw reads, more than  <dig> % were clean reads after initial processing . we performed  <dig> bp paired-end sequencing, and led to  <dig>  g raw bases and  <dig>  g clean bases in total.table  <dig> statistical data of the rna-seq reads for six samples



identification and characterization of lncrnas
the clean reads were mapped to the m. truncatula genome  using the tophat  <cit> . transcripts were then assembled and annotated using the cufflinks package  <cit> . known mrnas were identified according to the latest annotation of the m. truncatula genome sequence, and this led to the identification of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique mrnas from the six cdna libraries, respectively . the remaining reads were filtered according to length and coding potentials, such that transcripts smaller than  <dig> bp were excluded and transcripts with the coding potentials greater than – <dig> were removed. the remaining transcripts were considered as putative lncrnas.

from these analyses, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique lncrnas from the six cdna libraries, respectively . in total,  <dig>  unique lncrnas were obtained in the present study . and this number was similar to that of lncrnas in arabidopsis and maize  <cit> . we found that these lncrnas were more evenly distributed across the  <dig> chromosomes in m. truncatula with no obvious preferences of locations . according to the locations of lncrnas in the genome,  <dig>  intronic,  <dig>  intergenic,  <dig>  sense and  <dig>  antisense lncrnas were identified . in terms of the lncrnas’ length, the majority of lncrnas was relatively short. for example,  <dig>  % of them were shorter than  <dig>  nt . interestingly, lncrnas and mrnas were much more abundant in roots than in leaves, given that similar amounts of raw reads were obtained for both leaf and root samples. in all libraries, more lncrnas were detected in roots than in leaves . for example,  <dig>  lncrnas were identified in roots, while there were  <dig>  lncrnas in leaves under control condition . furthermore, we found that the accumulative frequency of lncrnas differed in leaves from that in roots. the proportion of lncrnas with a high level of expression was more than mrnas in leaves, but this expression pattern was in contrary in roots under the control conditions . moreover, these patterns of expression were not altered by treatments with osmotic and salt stress . the lack of chloroplast-derived rnas in roots might be a possible reason for the difference between leaves and roots.fig.  <dig> characteristics of m. truncatula lncrnas. a the expression level of lncrnas  along the eight m. truncatula chromosomes. it comprises six concentric rings, and each corresponds to a different sample. they are control in leaves , control in roots , osmotic stress in leaves , osmotic stress in roots , salt stress in leaves  and salt stress in roots  from outer to inner, respectively. b distribution of different types of lncrnas. the intronic, intergenic and sense/antisense lncrnas are represented by different concentric rings from outer to inner, according to the loci of lncrnas in the genome. c length distribution of lncrnas. d accumulative frequency of lncrnas and mrnas in two control samples. data from other samples is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  e composition of different types of lncrnas

all putative lncrnas in m. truncatula were aligned with lncrnas in a. thaliana from noncode database  <cit> . we can only detect  <dig> lncrnas that were comparable to those lncrnas in a. thaliana, suggesting that lncrnas are weakly conserved between the two species . moreover, lncrnas which were from transposons or which encoded micrornas were marked .

responses of lncrnas to osmotic and salt stresses
to identify osmotic stress- and salt stress-responsive lncrnas, the normalized expression  of lncrnas was compared amongst the six libraries.

lncrnas that were responsive to osmotic and salt stresses in leaves and roots were identified by determining the p-value and false discovery rate. to verify the results from the rna-seq experiments,  <dig> lncrnas were selected to verify their expression by quantitative real-time pcr  . these results indicate that our transcriptomic analysis is highly reproducible and reliable, and that lncrnas identified from the high throughput sequencing represent real transcripts.fig.  <dig> compare of expressional results between rna-seq and qrt-pcr. the results of three lncrnas are shown here. data of all  <dig> lncrnas are shown in additional file 1: figure s3



transcript levels of  <dig>  lncrnas in leaves and  <dig>  lncrnas in roots were detected to be changed by the osmotic stress, and  <dig>  lncrnas in leaves and  <dig>  lncrnas in roots were identified to be responsive to the salt stress. venn diagrams showed common and specific lncrnas, whose expression was altered in roots and leaves by osmotic and salt stresses . some lncrnas in leaves and roots showed different responses to osmotic and salt stresses. there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  lncrnas, whose expression was changed in both leaves and roots by osmotic and salt stresses, respectively. in leaves, more than half of stress-responsive lncrnas were common between osmotic stress  and salt stress . however, these values were decreased to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in roots, respectively. the expression levels of  <dig> lncrnas were found to be changed in the four treated samples . among the lncrnas, whose expression was changed in responses to osmotic and salt stresses, we further classified them to up-regulated and down-regulated classes . for examples,  <dig>  and  <dig>  lncrnas in leaves were up-regulated in responses to osmotic and salt stresses, respectively, and  <dig> lncrnas shared similar expression patterns in responses to these two stresses. twenty-eight and  <dig> lncrnas were found to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in both roots and leaves treated with osmotic and salt stresses.

functional analysis of stress-responsive lncrnas
previous studies showed that lncrnas are preferentially located in a close proximity to genes that they regulate . to reveal potential functions of the identified lncrnas, we analyzed gene ontology  terms of genes that were co-expressed and spaced by less than  <dig> kb with the stress-responsive lncrnas. we detected significant enrichments  of  <dig> and  <dig> go terms in leaves under osmotic stress and salt stress, respectively . for examples, we found go term enrichments in cellular component , molecular functions  and biological processes . in roots, go term enrichments were greater than those in leaves , suggesting that roots are more sensitive to osmotic and salt stresses than leaves . these findings suggest that the stress-responsive lncrnas may regulate genes involved in many biological processes, including signal transduction, energy synthesis, molecule metabolism, detoxification, transcription and translation in response to osmotic and salt stresses.fig.  <dig> go enhancements in leaves of m. truncatula under osmotic stress  and salt stress . the reliability is calculated by –log <dig> 



one lncrna may regulate multiple other lncrnas and protein-coding genes, and vice versa  <cit> . to unravel the relationship among lncrnas and protein-coding rnas which were co-expressed and spaced by less than  <dig> kb, putative interactive networks were constructed using cytoscape . about half of them had less than or equal to three nodes like networks in fig. 5c. more complex interactive networks were also observed. for example, thirteen protein-coding genes involved in oxidation/reduction reaction, transcription, energy synthesis and signal transduction were found to be regulated by three lncrnas in the situation of salt stress in leaves . two transcription factors of myb and zinc finger families were found in the network of fig. 5b, which may activate stress-responsive genes in the downstream under osmotic stress in roots. the expression of lncrnas in fig. 5c has been validated in fig.  <dig>  tcons_ <dig> was identified as regulator of cytochrome p <dig> in roots under salt stress. the targets of tcons_ <dig> and tcons_ <dig> may be two transmembrane proteins in leaves under salt stress. these networks among lncrnas and protein-coding genes may play important roles in sensing and responding to osmotic and salt stresses. the construction of putative network based on gene expression and vicinity of the lncrnas and protein-coding genes may not be very robust due to the few number of samples used. future studies to validate the regulatory relationships between lncrnas and protein-coding genes by specifically investigating the functions of lncrnas are warranted.fig.  <dig> representatives of predicted interaction networks among lncrnas and protein-coding rnas. the triangular and foursquare nodes represent lncrnas and protein-coding genes, respectively. the up-regulated and down-regulated nodes are colored in red and green, respectively. edges depict regulatory interactions among nodes



under stresses, many go terms were enriched, such as carbonate dehydratase activity  and carbon utilization  that are highly significant  in leaves under osmotic and salt stresses . the carbonic anhydrase gene medtr6g <dig>  belonging to these two go terms was down-regulated by these two abiotic stresses. this gene is predicted to be regulated by the lncrna tcons_ <dig> located in the upstream of the coding region of medtr6g <dig> . carbonic anhydrase catalyzing the reversible hydration of co <dig> into bicarbonate plays an essential role in the accumulation of co <dig> in the active site of rubisco  <cit> . our results suggest that tcons_ <dig> may regulate photosynthesis under the abiotic stresses by regulating the expression of medtr6g <dig> fig.  <dig> structure of lncrnas and their putative targets. each figure has two separate panels showing the read coverage and alignment of rna-seq data. in the panel of read coverage, the height represents the expression level of corresponding loci in the genome; in alignment of rna-seq panel, the rectangles represent the regions which can be transcribed



under conditions of abiotic stresses, signal transduction networks are mobilized to cope with the stressed environment. the pathway of phospholipids metabolism has been proposed to be an important in response to a number of abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example, drought and salt stresses up-regulate the expression of genes encoding phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c , which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate to the secondary messenger molecules inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol  <cit> . in the present study, the expression of a pi-plc gene , which belongs to go: <dig>  and go: <dig>  was up-regulated in response to osmotic and salt stresses, and the lncrna tcons_ <dig> was expressed from the regulatory region of medtr3g <dig> . these results suggested that tcons_ <dig> may regulate the expression of medtr3g <dig> 

plants under osmotic and salt stresses often display oxidative stress symptoms as indicated by marked accumulation of reactive oxygen species , which damages membrane systems. to cope with the excessive accumulation of ros, plants mobilize antioxidant enzymes to scavenge ros  <cit> . we found that the expression of medtr7g <dig> coding for glutathione peroxidase  was up-regulated in roots. we identified the lncrna tcons_ <dig> located approximately  <dig>  kb upstream of the coding sequence of medtr7g <dig> . these results suggest that tcons_ <dig> may be involved in regulating plant’s tolerance to the oxidative stress by modulating the expression of pod.

effect of salinity on plant growth can be divided into ionic toxicity and osmotic stress  <cit> . plants often exhibit similar tolerance mechanisms, such as altered energy synthesis, phospholipids signal transduction and detoxification to osmotic and salt stresses  <cit> . in addition, we found that the expression of the na+/h+ exchanger  gene medtr1g <dig> was up-regulated by the salt stress in roots. this gene codes for a vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter mediating na+ influx into the vacuoles  <cit> . this gene is predicted to be regulated by the lncrna tcons_ <dig> located in the upstream of the coding region of medtr1g <dig> . these results suggest that tcons_ <dig> is likely a regulator of medtr1g <dig> 

discussion
less than  <dig> % of the human genome sequences codes for proteins  <cit> . however, transcription is not limited to protein-coding regions  <cit> . in fact, more than  <dig> % of the human genome sequences are likely transcribed  <cit> . these non-coding transcribed sequences are from introns, intergenic regions or the antisense strand of protein-coding genes  <cit> . an increasing number of studies have shown that ncrnas play important roles in many vital biological processes, highlighting that ncrnas are not transcriptional “noises”  <cit> .

studies on lncrnas are less extensive in plants than in mammals, and those studies are mainly conducted in a. thaliana  <cit> . in addition to cereals, legumes are the most important sources for human foods and animal feeds worldwide. moreover, legumes are unique among cultivated plants for their ability to directly utilize atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic interactions with the soil bacteria rhizobia  <cit> . according to the genome sequences of m. truncatula, only about  <dig> % of the sequences code for proteins  <cit> . previous studies in m. truncatula have been concentrated upon protein-coding sequences associated with nodulation, abiotic stresses and developmental processes . several recent studies have investigated functions of small rnas involved in nodulation and abiotic stresses . in this report, we show that lncrnas are distributed in almost the entire genome of m. truncatula, suggesting that lncrna-coding regions are much more widespread than protein-coding regions . whole genome sequencing and annotation facilitate functional studies of protein-coding genes  <cit> . identification and characterization of the large number of lncrnas in m. truncatula in the present study provide valuable information for functional characterization of lncrnas in plants in general and in legumes in particular.

in the present study, the reverse transcription was made by using complementary sequences of artificial adaptors to enrich lncrnas with or without poly tails. to distinguish sense from antisense lncrnas, strand-specific libraries were constructed and paired-end sequencing was carried out in the present study. as a result, our results can be used to identify different types of lncrnas to facilitate functional studies. moreover, the abundant original data  generated in the present study allow us to detect lncrnas that have low expression levels. given that the expression of lncrnas is highly tissue-specific  <cit> , lncrnas from both leaves and roots of m. truncatula were sequenced and their expression patterns were compared. in addition, we also sequenced and compared the expression of protein-coding genes in both leaves and roots under control and stressed conditions. this information is useful for predicting putative targets of lncrnas. furthermore, we identified common and specific lncrnas from leaves and roots treated with osmotic or salt stresses to study potential functions of lncrnas in plant’s responses to abiotic stresses. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a comprehensive set of lncrnas isolated from osmotic-and salt-stress treated leaf and root samples of higher plants using high-throughput sequencing. unlike previous studies where osmotic and salt stress-responsive lincrnas  were detected in arabidopsis  <cit>  and populus  <cit> , the present study identified all types of lncrnas involved in osmotic and salt stresses in m. truncatula by the strand-specific sequencing. moreover, to make sure that the putative lncrnas in this study conform to the criteria of length and protein-coding ability, the putative lncrnas were selected to have > <dig> bp in length and less than – <dig> for the coding potential score. these strict criteria and improved methods made the identified lncrnas with high sensitivity and selectivity.

to minimize the adverse effects of abiotic stresses, plants have evolved a suite of responsive mechanisms  <cit> . there are many protein-coding genes which are identified to play regulatory roles under varying abiotic stresses, such as dreb1a/cbf <dig>  sos <dig> and so on . however, little is known of biological functions of lncrnas in abiotic stress responses in plants. moreover, lncrnas are putative potent tools for plant improvement to enhance their resistance to abiotic stresses  <cit> . therefore, identification of abiotic stress-responsive lncrnas, characterization of their functions and dissection of their regulatory networks can enhance our mechanistic understanding of plant response and adaptation to stressed environment. several recent studies have identified lncrnas involved in biotic/abiotic stresses in plants. fusarium oxysporum, a soil-borne plant fungal pathogen, causes the vascular wilt disease through roots in several plant species  <cit> . lncrnas that are responsive to f. oxysporum have been identified by rna-seq, and functional characterization of these lncrnas reveals that lncrnas are important components of the anti-fungal networks in a. thaliana  <cit> . for abiotic stress responses,  <dig> lncrnas have been identified from a full-length cdna library of a. thaliana  <cit> . of these,  <dig> lncrnas have been shown involved in abiotic stress responses; overexpression of two identified lncrnas renders plants more tolerance to salinity. however, because the full-length cdna library was made from mrnas with poly tails, lncrnas without poly tails have not been identified in that study. in our present study, reverse transcription was made by complementary sequences of artificial adaptors, thus, lncrnas with or without poly tails were obtained. liu et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig>  lincrnas, of which  <dig>  lincrnas are responsive to drought, cold, salinity and/or abscisic acid. in a recent study, a total of  <dig> drought-responsive lincrnas has been detected in populus  <cit> . however, in these studies, only lincrnas, rather than all types of lncrnas, are analyzed. in our study, all types of lncrnas, including those of sense, antisense, intronic and intergenic lncrnas were identified using the advanced sequencing technology and analytic methods such as strand-specific sequencing and cuffcompare analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified  <dig>  putative lncrnas from six rna-seq libraries of m. truncatula by high-throughput sequencing, of which  <dig>  and  <dig>  lncrnas are found to be responsive to osmotic stress and salt stress, respectively. of these,  <dig>  lncrnas are found to be responsive to both osmotic and salt stress. we analyzed go terms of genes that either overlap with or are immediate neighbors of the stress-responsive lncrnas. we found enrichments of go terms in many biological processes, including signal transduction, energy synthesis, molecule metabolism, detoxification, transcription and translation. moreover, a number of complex interaction networks were constructed based on co-expression and genomic co-location of lncrnas and protein-coding genes. these results suggest that lncrnas are likely involved in regulating plant’s responses and adaptation to osmotic and salt stresses in complex regulatory networks with protein-coding genes. these findings provide valuable information for further functional characterization of lncrnas in responses of plants in general and m. truncatula in particular to abiotic stresses.
