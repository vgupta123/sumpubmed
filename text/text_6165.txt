BACKGROUND
moraxella catarrhalis colonizes the mucosal surface of the human nasopharynx and is a major cause of acute otitis media in children and of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults  <cit> . clinical studies have revealed that the prevalence of pharyngeal colonization and respiratory tract infections caused by m. catarrhalis displays seasonal variation and increases in winter  <cit> . because breathing cold air  reduces the nasopharyngeal temperature from 34°c at room temperature to ~26°c within several minutes and for extended periods of time  <cit> , the human nasopharyngeal flora is repeatedly exposed to rapid downshifts of environmental temperature. in addition to viral infections that pave the way for subsequent secondary bacterial infections  <cit> , the rapid downshift of temperature induces adaptive events in the residential upper respiratory tract flora that may lead to the transition from asymptomatic colonization to bacterial secondary infection. our previous findings established that a 26°c cold shock upregulates the expression of uspa <dig>  a major adhesin and putative virulence factor of m. catarrhalis, and promotes m. catarrhalis adherence to upper respiratory tract cells via enhanced binding to fibronectin  <cit> . exposure of m. catarrhalis to 26°c also increases the outer membrane protein -mediated release of the proinflammatory cytokine il- <dig> in pharyngeal epithelial cells and reduces the expression of porin m <dig>  which may affect the resistance to aminopenicillins  <cit> .

among the various putative virulence factors that have been identified to date, several other proteinaceous antigens including lactoferrin-binding proteins , transferrin-binding proteins , copb, uspa <dig> and hemagglutinin  may be involved in the cold shock response and thus be important in adapting to and colonizing the human host. iron is an essential nutrient for most bacteria and m. catarrhalis overcomes the host's restriction of free iron through the evolution of iron acquisition systems which enable it to use lactoferrin, transferrin, hemoglobin, and hemin as iron sources. the primary site of m. catarrhalis entry into the human host is the nasopharynx, where lactoferrin is the predominant source of iron. therefore, efficient iron acquisition from lactoferrin is an important virulence factor for pathogenic bacteria. the surface protein copb is involved in the ability of m.catarrhalis to acquire iron from human transferrin and lactoferrin and is also an important factor responsible for complement evasion  <cit> . uspa <dig>  a major omp of m. catarrhalis, binds vitronectin, a component of both plasma and the extracellular matrix, and confers serum resistance of m. catarrhalis  <cit> . furthermore, the uspa <dig> is able to bind human c <dig> and c4bp protecting m. catarrhalis from complement-mediated killing  <cit> . the surface protein hag/mid that acts as an adhesin and hemagglutinin, exhibits unique immunoglobulin  d-binding properties and binds to both soluble and membrane-bound igd on b cells  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated that exposure of m. catarrhalis to 26°c down-regulates hag mrna expression  <cit> , indicating a possible involvement of hag in the cold shock response.

in the present study we investigated the effect of a 26°c cold shock on the expression of genes involved in iron acquisition, serum resistance and immune evasion. cold shock induced the expression of genes involved in transferrin/lactoferrin acquisition and enhanced binding of these proteins on the surface of m. catarrhalis. exposure of m. catarrhalis to 26°c upregulated the expression of uspa <dig>  a major omp involved in serum resistance, leading to the improved vitronectin binding. in contrast, cold shock decreased the expression of hag, a major adhesin mediating b cell response, and reduced igd-binding on the surface of m. catarrhalis.

rna methods
rna for mrna expression analysis was isolated and used for complementary dna  synthesis as described elsewhere  <cit> . generated cdna was amplified by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction  using primers for lbpb , lbpa , tbpb , tbpa  and 16s ribosomal rna  tggtcag-3', 5'-ctttacgcccatatccg-3').

quantitative real-time pcr was performed in triplicate for both target and normalizer  genes. no-template controls and rt-negative controls were included in each run. primers and probes were purchased from applied biosystems. primers for tbpb were 5'-tcctttcacttcgctaaatcggttt-3', 5'-ccacacaagatgcggtcaaatataaa-3', and taqman probe was 5'-cctttgttggcaacatc-3'. primers for uspa <dig> were 5'-gccttagacaccaaagtcaatgc-3', 5'-aagctgccctaagtggtctattc-3', and taqman probe was 5'-tgaaaacggtatggctg-3'. primers and probes for hag and 16s rrna were used as described elsewhere  <cit> . relative quantification of gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold method. the ratios obtained after normalization were expressed as folds of change compared with samples isolated from bacteria exposed for  <dig> h at 37°c.

immunoblotting
om vesicles, composed of omps and lipooligosaccharide , from strain o35e exposed for  <dig> h to either 26°c or 37°c were prepared by the edta buffer method  <cit> . samples were resolved by sds-page using a  <dig> % polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes . lactoferrin binding was detected using mouse anti-human lactoferrin monoclonal antibody  and horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody . iga-binding was detected using human saliva samples as the primary antibody source and hrp-conjugated goat anti-human iga  as secondary antibody. sampling of saliva from healthy volunteers was approved by the local ethics committee.

solid-phase lactoferrin binding assay
detection of lactoferrin binding to m. catarrhalis was performed as described elsewhere  <cit> . equal amounts of strain o35e grown at 26°c or 37°c for  <dig> h were spotted onto the nitrocellulose membranes. the blots were blocked in tris-buffered saline  containing  <dig> % nonfat dry milk and incubated with human lactoferrin , followed by a mouse anti-human lactoferrin antibody and developed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
analysis of omps spots of strain o35e was performed as described previously  <cit> . to identify the proteins indicated in figure  <dig>  the maldi-tof was used  <cit> . protein concentration was determined using the 2-d quant-kit . differential analysis was performed using the imagemaster 2d platinum software version  <dig>   for spot detection, quantification, matching and comparative analysis. the expression level was determined by the relative volume of each spot in the gel and expressed as %volume ). this normalized spot volume takes into account variations due to protein loading and staining by considering the total volume over all the spots present in the gel. a collection of  <dig> gels  resulting from three independent experiments was analyzed. spots detected by the program were matched between the three gel pairs. variations in abundance were calculated as the ratio of average values of %vol between two temperatures. only spots with a %vol variation ratio greater than  <dig>  in the imagemaster 2d platinum report were considered relevant.

treatment of m. catarrhalis with lactoferrin
treatment of m. catarrhalis with lactoferrin was performed as described elsewhere  <cit> . strain o35e was grown to an od <dig> of  <dig> , resuspended in assay solution containing  <dig> % gelatine to a concentration of  <dig> cfu/ml prior to the addition of lactoferrin . samples were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> and  <dig> h followed by plating on bhi agar to determine viability.

flow cytometry
bacteria were exposed to 26°c or 37°c for  <dig> h. the od <dig> was adjusted to  <dig> , the 200-μl aliquots were washed in pbs-1% bsa, and incubated with  <dig> μg/ml of lactoferrin or with  <dig> μg of vitronectin  for  <dig> h. to assess the ability of m. catarrhalis to bind salivary lactoferrin, bacteria were preincubated with saliva samples  from healthy adults. bacteria were incubated with mouse anti-human lactoferrin monoclonal antibody  or mouse anti-human vitronectin monoclonal antibody  followed by incubation with alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody  and analyzed on a facscan cytometer using cellquest software . anti-human lactoferrin or vitronectin antibodies and alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody were added separately as negative controls.

RESULTS
om proteome analysis following cold shock in m. catarrhalis
to assess cold shock-induced changes in the om proteome of m. catarrhalis, 2-de analysis was used. omps were isolated from a culture of m. catarrhalis strain o35e, which was exposed to a 3-hour cold shock at 26°c or to continuous growth at 37°c. a collection of  <dig> gels  resulting from three independent experiments was analyzed. three omps  were found to be differentially  regulated in response to a 26°c cold shock . among these proteins, two spots  were upregulated and one spot  was down-regulated at 26°c  in comparison with exposure to 37°c . the  <dig> kda spot, which is upregulated at 26°c, was identified by comparing spot pattern of m. catarrhalis o35e wild-type and o35e.tbpb mutant strain as tbpb , a peripheral om lipoprotein possessing transferrin-binding properties, indicating that cold shock may increase iron acquisition, which is important for both growth and virulence.

increased expression of genes involved in iron acquisition of m. catarrhalis induced by cold shock
to confirm the contribution of tbpb in the cold shock response, we assessed the tbpb mrna expression level of strain o35e exposed to either 26°c or 37°c. the expression level of tbpb was significantly increased at 26°c in comparison to expression at 37°c . a similar expression pattern of tbpb was also observed in m. catarrhalis clinical isolate  <dig> . cold shock at 26°c also enhanced the mrna level of tbpa, an integral om transferrin binding protein . low free iron conditions  caused an increase in gene transcription in bacteria grown at 37°c to a level similar to that seen in cells exposed to cold shock.

because lactoferrin rather than transferrin is the primary carrier of iron on mucosal surfaces and lactoferrin binding proteins are thought to be important virulence factors in some gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , we investigated whether cold shock affects the expression of these genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  cold shock increased the mrna level of lbpb and lbpa genes in strain o35e after  <dig> h of incubation at 26°c . furthermore, cold shock increased the transcriptional level of lbpa and lbpb of other clinical isolates indicating that this effect is a general characteristic of m. catarrhalis .

enhanced binding of transferrin and lactoferrin on the surface of m. catarrhalis induced by cold shock
because a temperature drop from 37°c to 26°c induces an increase in the copy numbers of genes involved in iron acquisition, we investigated whether it also affects the binding to human transferrin and lactoferrin. strain o35e and its tbpb-deficient mutant were exposed to 26°c or 37°c and evaluated for their ability to bind transferrin. binding to transferrin was increased when bacteria were exposed to 26°c . the absence of tbpb reduced binding to transferrin, indicating that tbpb is required for maximum binding of transferrin on the surface of cold shock-induced m. catarrhalis.

binding to lactoferrin in a whole-cell solid-phase binding assay was significantly increased when bacteria were exposed to 26°c, in comparison with exposure to 37°c . the surface binding of human salivary and milk lactoferrin  was further quantitated using flow cytometry, resulting in a clear shift of fluorescence intensity for m. catarrhalis exposed at 26°c . immunoblot analysis revealed that omps isolated from strain o35e exposed to 26°c display a greater lactoferrin binding capacity in comparison to omps isolated from cells exposed to 37°c . the band with a strong lactoferrin-binding capacity and an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda most likely represents lbpa because only lbpa , an integral omp, is able to bind lactoferrin and is essential for iron acquisition from lactoferrin, whereas lbpb only plays a facilitating role  <cit> .

since lactoferrin is an antibacterial protein found in human secretions  <cit> , it was important to determine its bactericidal effect on m. catarrhalis. no bactericidal effect was observed when m. catarrhalis strain o35e was incubated with human lactoferrin .

because copb is involved in the ability of m.catarrhalis to acquire iron from human lactoferrin and transferrin, we assessed the expression of this protein following cold shock. flow cytometry analysis demonstrates that exposure of m.catarrhalis strain o35e to 26°c increases the expression of copb on the bacterial surface .

cold shock results in upregulation of uspa <dig> and increases the binding of vitronectin on the surface of m. catarrhalis
to investigate the involvement of uspa <dig> in the cold shock response, we assessed uspa <dig> mrna expression levels after exposure of m. catarrhalis to 26°c or 37°c. quantitative rt-pcr showed no significant differences between 26°c and 37°c with respect to the relative amount of uspa <dig> mrna . we determined the expression of uspa <dig> after cold shock on the surface of m. catarrhalis. because the monoclonal antibody 17c <dig> recognizes both uspa1/a <dig>  we used uspa <dig> and uspa <dig> mutants, respectively, of strain o35e. expression of both uspa <dig> and uspa <dig> were increased on the surface of m. catarrhalis after cold shock . uspa <dig> mediates serum resistance of m. catarrhalis by binding vitronectin. given that cold shock induces uspa <dig> expression, we hypothesized that a temperature downshift might increase surface binding of vitronectin. we preincubated m. catarrhalis grown at 26°c or 37°c with human vitronectin and determined vitronectin binding by flow cytomertry. binding to vitronectin was increased when bacteria were exposed to 26°c . the absence of uspa <dig> diminished binding of vitronectin but did not abolish it, possibly due to uspa <dig> interactions with vitronectin  <cit> . serum bactericidal assay with m. catarrhalis strain o35e exposed to 26°c or 37°c demonstrated that cold shock did not influence serum resistance of o35e strain .

cold shock influences hag expression and binding of human igd on the surface of m. catarrhalis
to investigate the contribution of hag to the cold shock response, we assessed the hag mrna expression level of strain o35e exposed to either 26°c or  <dig> c. the expression level of hag was significantly reduced at 26°c in comparison to expression at 37°c . addressing the question whether a decreased mrna copy number of hag at 26°c translates into decreased expression of hag on the bacterial surface, we performed immunoblot analysis with omps preparations of strains o35e and  <dig> exposed at 26°c or 37°c for  <dig> h using human salivary iga antibodies which specifically recognize surface exposed omps, including hag  <cit> . immunoblot analysis revealed that m. catarrhalis strains o35e and  <dig> exposed at 26°c expressed smaller amounts of hag protein compared to bacteria incubated at 37°c . the hag-deficient o35e.hag strain did not bind the hag-specific salivary iga . since hag has been found to be responsible for m. catarrhalis binding to igd, we investigated igd-binding on the surface of bacteria grown at 26°c or 37°c. flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a slight decrease of igd-binding on the surface of strain o35e after cold shock, while igd-binding to clinical isolate  <dig> was clearly reduced at 26°c . the hag-deficient mutant displayed an overall reduced igd-binding level with increased binding of igd at 26°c in comparison to 37°c, suggesting that other om components might antagonize the hag-mediated igd-binding following cold shock. this concept is supported by previous findings demonstrating the ability of mucosal igd to recognize lipopolysaccaride, a key cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . indeed, the los-deficient mutant of m. catarrhalis strain o35e exhibited significantly decreased binding of igd on the surface of cold shock-induced bacteria in comparison with exposure to 37°c .

discussion
in this study, we have analyzed the cold shock-induced changes in the om proteome of m. catarrhalis and identified tbpb, whose expression was increased more than two-fold after a 26°c cold shock, as a member of the iron acquisition systems that is important for both growth and virulence. our data demonstrate that the expression of transferrin receptors and transferrin binding on the bacterial surface were also increased when m. catarrhalis was exposed to a 26°c cold shock. transferrin is predominantly found in serum and in serous exudates. during pronounced inflammation, it is likely that the local tissue damage results in the transsudation of various iron sources, including transferrin, to mucosal surfaces acting as additional iron sources for m. catarrhalis  <cit> .

we also demonstrate that a 26°c cold shock increased the expression of genes involved in lactoferrin acquisition and enhanced lactoferrin binding on the surface of m. catarrhalis. the overall presence of lactoferrin receptors in m. catarrhalis isolates suggests its important role in colonization or infection  <cit> . in our previous study we demonstrated that exposure of m. catarrhalis to 26°c increases the release of proinflammatory cytokine il- <dig> in pharyngeal epithelial cells likely leading to the increased inflammation  <cit> . thus, greater local concentrations of il- <dig> would promote enhanced recruitment and influx of neutrophils that release lactoferrin from their secondary granules, which contribute to lactoferrin levels both locally and in the circulation  <cit> . on the other hand, increased expression of m. catarrhalis lactoferrin binding proteins following cold shock would facilitate the binding and acquisition of iron from lactoferrin to support growth of bacteria in the mucosal environment. it has been shown that supplemental lactoferrin can enhance the virulence of meningococcal infection in mice  <cit> . in addition to iron acquisition, lactoferrin receptors may provide protection against anti-bacterial cationic peptides  and reduce complement-mediated killing. the pneumococcal surface protein pspa binds lactoferrin and protects streptococcus pneumoniae against the antibacterial effect of lactoferricin  <cit> . the release of lbpb from the cell surface by a nalp protease protects neisseria meningitidis against bactericidal antibodies  <cit> . therefore, increased expression of lactoferrin receptors and enhanced binding of lactoferrin on the surface of bacteria following cold shock might be associated with enhanced protection of m. catarrhalis against anti-bacterial cationic peptides and bactericidal antibodies.

the level of uspa <dig> protein that afforded serum resistance in the bactericidal activity assay has been shown to correlate with increased binding of vitronectin  <cit> . our results indicate that cold shock upregulates the uspa <dig> protein expression and promotes m. catarrhalis binding to vitronectin. increased uspa <dig> protein expression at 26°c was not the result of higher copy number of uspa <dig> mrna, indicating that post-transciptional mechanisms are involved in upregulation of this protein after cold shock  <cit> . cold shock did not influence the serum resistance of o35e strain indicating that m. catarrhalis strains may need to maintain a certain threshold level of uspa <dig> protein necessary to evade host defenses. most seroresistant m. catarrhalis strains express at 37°c sufficient levels of uspa <dig> to mediate serum resistance  <cit> . it is conceivable that cold shock would increase uspa <dig> expression and vitronectin binding in m. catarrhalis strains constitutively expressing low levels of uspa <dig>  leading to the enhanced serum resistance.

the infant population during the first year of life possesses a substantial proportion of igd in saliva  <cit> . the interaction between hag and igd mediates b cell endocytosis and killing of m. catarrhalis whereas non-igd-binding bacteria were not taken up by b cells  <cit> . furthermore, igd-stimulated mucosal basophils release antimicrobial factors inhibiting the replication of m. catarrhalis  <cit> . here we demonstrate that cold shock at 26°c reduces the mrna expression level of hag, hag protein expression and the hag-mediated binding of human igd to the surface of m. catarrhalis. decreased copy numbers of hag at 26°c were also found in other clinical isolates indicating that this effect is a general characteristic of seroresistant m. catarrhalis  <cit> . therefore, reduced expression of hag and decreased binding of igd on the bacterial surface following cold shock might lead to reduced stimulation of b cells and increased survival by prevention of endocytosis by these cells as well as to decreased stimulation of basophils leading to reduced release of antimicrobal factors. however, the presence of specific igd against los triggered increased recognition of bacteria following cold shock . consequently, children who lack los-specific igd may be more susceptible to m. catarrhalis infections, particularly after exposure to cold air.

three omps were found to be differentially  regulated in response to a 26°c cold shock , while immunoblot and flow cytometric analysis revealed that several other omps are also involved in cold shock response. the lack of some differentially regulated omps in the 2-de pattern might be the result of difficult identification or low abundance. furthermore, protein spots with a fold change below the indicated threshold were considered by the image master 2d program as not relevant.

thus, cold shock, which occurs when humans breathe cold air  <cit> , is a physiologic phenomenon during the cold season and entails a range of adaptive events in the residential upper respiratory tract flora that lead to the stimulation of nutrient -acquistion, serum resistance and immune evasion potentially resulting in increased bacterial density on the nasopharyngeal surface. clinical studies in children have demonstrated that the density of m. catarrhalis in the nasopharynx is positively associated with prolonged respiratory tract symptoms and a greater likelihood of purulent otitis media  <cit> . this study demonstrates that a 26°c cold shock induces the expression of genes involved in transferrin and lactoferrin acquisition, and enhances binding of these proteins on the surface of m. catarrhalis. exposure of m. catarrhalis to 26°c upregulates both copb and uspa <dig> expression, the latter leading to improved vitronectin binding on the surface of bacteria. in contrast, cold shock decreases the expression of hag and reduces the igd-binding on the surface of m. catarrhalis. these findings indicate that cold air in the human upper respiratory tract induces in m. catarrhalis a complex of adaptive mechanisms that may enable the bacterium to target their host cellular receptors or soluble effectors and consequently to display enhanced growth, colonization and virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
a physiologic cold shock as it occurs when humans breathe cold air for prolonged periods of time increases the capacity of m. catarrhalis for iron uptake from human lactoferrin and transferrin, enhances the capacity of m. catarrhalis to bind vitronectin, which neutralizes the lethal effect of human complement, and decreases igd-binding by hemagglutinin. these data support the notion that m. catarrhalis uses physiologic exposure to cold air to upregulate pivotal survival systems in the human pharynx that may contribute to bacterial virulence. thus, cold shock may exert adaptive events in at least one member of the residential upper respiratory tract flora of facultative pathogens, which may increase the bacterial density on the respiratory tract mucosal surface .
