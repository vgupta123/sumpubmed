BACKGROUND
surface layers  are cell envelope structures ubiquitously found in gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species as well as in archaea. they are composed of numerous identical protein subunits, 40– <dig> kda in molecular weight, which completely cover the cell surface forming a two-dimensional, regular array having either oblique , square  or hexagonal  symmetry. the subunits are held together and attached to the underlying cell surface by noncovalent interactions, and they have an intrinsic ability to spontaneously form regular layers either in solution or on a solid support under suitable conditions  <cit> . functions of s-layers are poorly known thus far. they include the determination and maintenance of cell shape, action as a protective coat, molecular sieve or ion trap or as a mediator of adhesion or surface recognition. the contribution of s-layers to virulence has been reported  <cit> .

in general, s-layer proteins have two structural regions in which two essential functions reside: a region involved in the attachment of the s-layer subunit to the cell envelope and a region involved in s-layer assembly. these regions have been characterized in several gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. in many gram-positive bacilli and in thermus thermophilus so called slh  motifs  <cit> , 55– <dig> amino acids long and often located in the n-terminal part of the protein, are responsible for the attachment of the subunit proteins to the cell wall through a pyruvylated polysaccharide receptor in the cell wall  <cit> . in s-layers of gram-positive bacteria not having slh-motifs the attachment to the cell wall has been proposed to be mediated by an interaction between basic amino acids in the cell wall binding region and negatively charged secondary cell wall polymers. the cell wall receptors of such s-layers in geobacillus species characterized so far contain mannuronic acid and can be classified as acidic oligosaccharides other than teichoic or teichuronic acids, while teichoic and lipoteichoic acids have been shown to be the cell wall receptors of the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus. however, some cell wall polysaccharides of gram-positive bacteria proposed to be involved in s-layer binding have a net neutral charge  <cit> .

among gram-positive bacteria, the self-assembly regions of s-layer proteins have so far been studied in the s-layers of lactobacilli , and in the s-layers of bacillus anthracis, lysinibacillus sphaericus and geobacillus stearothermophilus. these studies rely on electron microscopy of recombinant s-layer protein fragments, and the self-assembly region has been shown to be of either central or c-terminal location  <cit> .

in addition to l. brevis, s-layers have also been found in lactobacillus helveticus as well as in several lactobacillus acidophilus group bacteria  <cit>  including l. acidophilus, l. crispatus and l. gallinarum. the overall sequence similarity between characterized lactobacillus s-layer protein genes is low and similarity is usually found only between related species. the presence of multiple s-layer protein genes in a single strain is common in lactobacilli. for example, l. brevis atcc  <dig> has three s-layer protein genes, two of which are expressed under different environmental conditions and one is silent under laboratory conditions  <cit> . other typical features of lactobacillus s-layer proteins include their relatively small size and a high predicted overall pi  <cit> . self-assembly and cell wall binding regions have been characterized in the s-layer protein sa of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and cbsa of l. crispatus jcm  <dig>  <cit> . the sequences of sa and cbsa are homologous especially in the c-terminal region, which mediates the attachment to the cell wall, and the more variable n-terminal part is responsible for the self-assembly of the s-layer subunits.

the s-layer protein of lactobacillus brevis atcc  <dig>  slpa  <cit> , is a  <dig> amino acid,  <dig> kda protein, which assembles on the bacterial cell forming an oblique lattice  <cit>  and for which a fibronectin-binding function has been described  <cit> . l. brevis is phylogenetically distant from l. acidophilus group  <cit> , and this is reflected in the unique amino acid sequence of slpa compared to l. acidophilus group s-layer proteins  <cit> . foreign epitopes up to  <dig> amino acids long have been expressed in slpa in order to develop tools for mucosal immunization  <cit> . l. brevis atcc  <dig> would be a suitable strain to be used as a live oral vaccine, as it has a gras  status and it has been shown to possess probiotic properties  <cit> . for vaccine development, as well as for nanobiotechnological applications, for which regularly arranged s-layers are especially well-suited  <cit> , knowledge about the structure-function relationships of slpa, presented in this study, is essential.

in this work, we have characterized the two-domain structure of the s-layer protein slpa of l. brevis atcc  <dig> with its c-terminal self-assembly and n-terminal cell wall binding domains. conserved carbohydrate binding motifs were detected in the n-terminal, positively charged regions of six l. brevis s-layer proteins; however, the cell wall receptor of slpa was found to be different from the receptors of previously characterized lactobacillus s-layer proteins.

binding of the truncated s-layer proteins to bacterial cells and isolated cell wall fragments
binding assays of recombinant s-layer proteins to licl-extracted l. brevis atcc  <dig> and l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> cells were performed essentially as described previously  <cit> . the amount of recombinant s-layer protein used in one binding reaction was  <dig> μg and the buffer was  <dig> mm tris-hcl  with  <dig> mm nacl. the presence of cell-bound s-layer protein in the samples was verified by sds-page. in binding assays with isolated cell wall fragments, monomeric truncated s-layer proteins, present in the supernatant after centrifugation , were used.  <dig> μg cwf and  <dig> μg full length recombinant slpa or an equimolar amount of truncated s-layer proteins were combined in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl. after incubation  cell wall fragments were collected, washed once with  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm nacl, and analyzed by sds-page.

RESULTS
primary amino acid sequence analysis of the s-layer proteins of l. brevis
the only thus far characterized s-layer proteins in l. brevis are the slpa protein of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and the slpb, slpc and slpd proteins of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  <cit> . by performing a homology search for the recently sequenced genome of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  <cit>  with the blast program, two new putative s-layer proteins, q03p <dig> and q03nt <dig>  were identified in the genome.

the amino acid sequences encoding the mature s-layer proteins of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  and atcc  <dig>  and the putative mature s-layer proteins of atcc  <dig>  were subjected to a number of analyses. a multiple alignment of slpa, slpb, slpc, slpd, q03nt <dig> and q03p <dig> amino acid sequences revealed significant conservation in the n-terminal regions . analysis of the distribution of the isoelectric point values in l. brevis s-layer proteins revealed a distinction between the n-terminal region with a high predicted pi and a c-terminal region with a low predicted pi in each of the proteins . in slpa and slpb the region of a high predicted pi comprises approximately two fifths of the protein, while in slpd and its homolog, q03p <dig>  as well as in slpc and its homolog, q03nt <dig>  the region of an overall high pi extends further towards the c-terminus and the most distinct boundary between the differently charged regions is located around residue  <dig> in slpc and q03nt <dig> and around residue  <dig> in slpd and q03p <dig>  hydrophobicity analysis performed for the s-layer protein sequences of l. brevis showed a similar distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues along the mature proteins with evenly alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, as exemplified by the hydrophobicity plot of slpa in fig. 1b.

to predict the domain organization of slpa, the analyses performed were compared with similar analyses of the s-layer proteins of l. acidophilus group organisms  <cit> . in each of the l. acidophilus s-layer proteins, one region is found which is conserved, located at the c-terminus and contains positively charged and hydrophilic sequences. in sa of l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> and cbsa of l. crispatus jcm  <dig> these domains mediate the binding to the cell wall, while the variable n-terminal regions are responsible for the assembly of the s-layer  <cit> . in cbsa the variable n-terminal domain is also responsible for collagen binding  <cit> . the only function characterized for slpa so far, binding to fibronectin and human epithelial cells  <cit> , resides in the conserved n-terminal region. however, the pattern of sequence conservation and the distribution of charge in the six l. brevis s-layer proteins strongly suggested a domain organization similar to that found in l. acidophilus-group s-layer proteins with the functional domains in a reverse order.

cloning and expression of gene sequences encoding the mature or truncated forms of the s-layer protein slpa and purification of the recombinant proteins
pcr products encoding the mature slpa and the various n- or c-terminal slpa truncations were cloned in e. coli dh5αf' and expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  the proteins produced are summarized in fig  <dig>  after induction of expression by the addition of iptg, samples of cultures from e. coli bl <dig> were harvested and analyzed by sds-page. on sds-gels, each of the recombinant slpa proteins became visible as an additional protein band, corresponding approximately to the calculated molecular mass of the rslpa proteins . the proteins were purified in a large scale, and total protein yields varied from  <dig> to  <dig> mg per a batch cultivation of  <dig> ml.

proteolytic degradation of slpa protein with trypsin and peptide mapping
to gain insight to the domain structure of slpa, wild type slpa was digested with trypsin. this revealed two protease resistant fragments with apparent molecular masses of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda . the n-terminal sequences of these peptides were determined to be gfsttag  and svtatnd . these correspond to amino acids starting from  <dig> and  <dig> of mature slpa, respectively. peptide mass mapping of the protease resistant fragments obtained after trypsin digestion revealed that the peptide encompassing the last  <dig> amino acids of full length slpa is lacking from these fragments . the protease resistance of the regions  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> in mature slpa strongly suggested the existence of a compact domain structure most likely representing a region exposed on the outer surface of the s-layer.

investigation of the self-assembly properties of the truncated s-layer protein forms
as a preliminary test for the putative self-assembly properties of the truncated s-layer proteins, the formation of a precipitate after dialysis from ghcl was inspected. as shown in fig.  <dig>  c-terminally truncated proteins rslpa1– <dig>  rslpa1– <dig> and rslpa1– <dig> had lost the ability to form precipitates. n-terminally truncated forms rslpa179– <dig> and rslpa167– <dig> precipitated efficiently after dialysis, while rslpa146– <dig>  rslpa149– <dig> as well as rslpa190– <dig> and rslpa190– <dig> showed a reduced precipitation. the last twelve residues in the c-terminus of slpa had no effect on the precipitation, as rslpa190– <dig> showed a precipitation similar to rslpa190– <dig>  the removal of  <dig> residues or more from the n-terminus of slpa abolished the ability of the truncated proteins to form precipitates.

precipitate-forming n-terminally truncated slpa proteins were chosen for transmission electron microscopical analysis of lattice formation. in these studies, rslpa formed an oblique lattice that was identical with that formed by slpa isolated from wild type l. brevis atcc  <dig> cells , as well as with the lattice seen on l. brevis atcc  <dig> cells in the freeze-etched preparation , proving the native conformation of recombinant slpa. in accordance, lattice constants for the self-assembly products of rslpa  and for the self-assembly products of slpa isolated from l. brevis atcc  <dig> cells  were practically identical. the recombinant protein slpa179– <dig>  was found to form a regular, oblique lattice indistinguishable from that formed by full length rslpa, but the removal of eleven residues more from the n-terminus resulting in rslpa190– <dig> prevented lattice formation . surprisingly, the two larger n-terminally truncated proteins, rslpa167– <dig> and rslpa149– <dig>  were unable to form regular lattice structures. thus, residues 179– <dig> in mature slpa define the region responsible for the crystallization of slpa monomers.

isolation of native cell wall fragments and binding of the truncated s-layer proteins to cell wall fragments
cell wall fragments were purified from a stationary phase culture of l. brevis cells by differential centrifugation of ghcl-treated, mechanically disrupted cells followed by treatments with nucleases and boiling sds as described in materials and methods. this method efficiently removes membrane fragments and noncovalently bound cell wall components like lipoteichoic acids , but leaves covalently bound secondary cell wall polymers, like wall teichoic acids and other carbohydrates, essentially intact. the purity of the cell wall preparation was checked by light and transmission electron microscopy . from  <dig>  g of wet cells approximately  <dig> mg of cell wall fragments  were recovered.

to test the hypothesis that the n-terminal, positively charged region of slpa is responsible for anchoring the s-layer to the cell wall, truncated recombinant slpa-proteins encompassing the n- and c-terminal regions of slpa were tested for binding to isolated l. brevis cell wall fragments. as shown in fig. 6a, full length rslpa, rslpa1– <dig> and rslpa1– <dig> localized in the pellet fraction after incubation with the cell wall fragments, while rslpa190– <dig> and rslpa167– <dig> were unable to bind to cwf and were found in the supernatant. truncated s-layer proteins incubated alone mainly localized to the supernatant, although small amounts were found in the pellets due to the inherent tendency of s-layer proteins to aggregate. these results are in good accordance with our results from similar experiments with whole, licl-treated l. brevis atcc  <dig> and l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> cells. in these experiments, full length rslpa, rslpa1– <dig> and rslpa1– <dig> as well as rslpa1– <dig> bound to l. brevis cells, while rslpa190– <dig>  rslpa167– <dig> and rslpa210– <dig> were unable to bind. full-length rslpa and its cell wall binding fragment rslpa1– <dig> also bound to licl-treated l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> cells .

to get preliminary information about the cell wall component interacting with the n-terminal region of slpa, binding tests with full length rslpa and cwf treated with tca at +4°c or at +37°c were performed. rslpa bound to cwf treated with tca at +4°c as efficiently as to native cwf, while the treatment of cwf with tca at +37°c substantially reduced the binding of rslpa . repeated tca-extraction at +4°c and a change in the rslpa: cwf-ratio from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> did not change the result . tca extracts carbohydrate polymers, and the treatment at +4°c has been reported to selectively remove teichoic acids, while the treatment at +37°c removes teichuronic acids and polysaccharides  <cit> . the efficiency of the extraction was confirmed by the measurement of organic phosphorous from native and tca-treated cwf as well as from the supernatant obtained in the extraction, which indicated the loss of approximately 75% of the organic phosphorous from the cwf by the treatment at +4°c . these results suggest that the binding component in the l. brevis atcc  <dig> cell wall is other than teichoic acid, and that cell wall components extractable by tca at +37°c, presumably polysaccharides, participate in the binding.

the amino acid sequence analysis of slpa and other lactobacillus brevis s-layer proteins revealed sequences in the n-terminal regions with apparent similarity to the repetitive carbohydrate binding motifs of clostridial toxins and streptococcal glucosyltransferases  <cit> . these regions were found within amino acids 60– <dig> and 165– <dig> in each of the mature proteins . in the n-terminal parts of slpc and q03nt <dig> as well as slpd and q03p <dig> additional regions with less obvious similarity were detected as well. similar motifs have also been detected in the c-terminal cell wall binding regions of l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> sa protein and l. crispatus jcm  <dig> cbsa protein as well as in the s-layer protein of l. helveticus cnrz  <dig> and in several other bacterial cell surface-associated proteins, in which they were located in two tandemly repeated sequences of 65– <dig> amino acids  <cit> . a protein repeat analysis of the l. brevis s-layer proteins did not indicate the presence of the carbohydrate binding sequences in obvious repeat sequences, and despite the similar carbohydrate binding motifs in slpa and in l. acidophilus group s-layer proteins, the cell wall receptor of slpa apparently is dissimilar.

discussion
in this study, we have identified the cell wall binding and self-assembly domains in the s-layer protein slpa of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  a strain phylogenetically distant from l. acidophilus group organisms, the s-layer proteins of which have previously been functionally characterized. two new putative s-layer proteins, q03p <dig> and q03nt <dig>  were identified in the recently sequenced genome of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and compared with slpa and other l. brevis s-layer proteins characterized thus far. q03p <dig> is almost identical  with slpd of l. brevis atcc  <dig> and relatively dissimilar  from the slpa, slpb and slpc sequences. q03nt <dig> is highly similar with slpc of l. brevis atcc  <dig>  whereas not that similar with the other characterized l. brevis s-layer proteins . similarity of the mature forms of the new putative s-layer proteins or the mature forms of slpa, slpb, slpc or slpd proteins with l. acidophilus group s-layer proteins is negligible.

analysis of the six l. brevis s-layer protein sequences deposited in databanks indicated the subdivision of each sequence into two regions: a conserved n-terminal region characterized by a high predicted pi and potential carbohydrate binding motifs, and a more variable c-terminal region with an acidic predicted pi, with the n-terminal region corresponding for 40–75% of the sequence lengths. the observed high predicted overall pi values of lactobacillus s-layer proteins  <cit>  thus seem to be due to the concentration of basic amino acids to a defined region, as is also the case in the s-layer proteins of l. acidophilus group, which have cationic, cell wall binding c-terminal regions.

the presence of a conserved n-terminal region with a high predicted pi in l. brevis s-layer proteins strongly suggested an n-terminal cell wall binding domain. this was confirmed for slpa of l. brevis atcc  <dig> by interaction studies performed with truncated rslpa proteins and licl-treated l. brevis cells or isolated l. brevis cell wall fragments. in these studies, truncated proteins encompassing the whole positively charged region of slpa bound to the cell wall; however, the first  <dig> residues in mature slpa contained sufficient information for cell wall binding. an assay suitable for measuring the binding strength would be needed to detect the putative difference between the cell wall binding affinities of slpa1– <dig> and slpa1– <dig>  in s-layer proteins of lactobacilli, no slh motifs have been detected. instead, interactions between a positively charged s-layer protein region and negatively charged secondary cell wall polymers have been shown to mediate the cell wall binding in the case of sa of l. acidophilus atcc  <dig>  <cit>  and cbsa of l. crispatus jcm  <dig>  <cit> . sa and cbsa were shown to bind teichoic acids, and cbsa bound also to lipoteichoic acids purified from staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, but not to the teichuronic acid/polysaccharide fraction of the cell wall of l. crispatus jcm  <dig>  in contrast, the results of this study suggest the involvement of another cell wall structure than teichoic acid or lipoteichoic acid in the interaction between slpa and the cell wall, as the purification process of the cwf used efficiently removed ltas, and the extraction of cwf with tca at +4°c to remove teichoic acids had no effect on the binding of slpa.

the chemical nature of the cell wall component interacting with the s-layer protein has been determined in geobacillus stearothermophilus strains  <cit> , in lysinibacillus sphaericus  <cit>  and in aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus  <cit> . in g. stearothermophilus and l. sphaericus s-layers, which possess slh-domains, the component is a pyruvylated glcnac and galnac-containing polysaccharide not groupable as a teichoic or lipoteichoic acid. in other g. stearothermophilus strains the component is a negatively charged mannuronic acid-containing cell wall polymer, and in a. thermoaerophilus the cell wall receptor is a neutral biantennary oligosaccharide.

the secondary cell wall polymers of lactobacilli are poorly characterized. the detailed structure of a wall polysaccharide of l. casei has been determined  <cit> , but no precise structures for polysaccharides of l. brevis strains are available at present. in early studies, the cell walls of l. buchneri  <cit>  and l. brevis atcc  <dig>  <cit>  were shown to contain neutral polysaccharides, which were suggested to be involved in the anchoring of the s-layer protein to the cell wall through hydrogen bonding  <cit> . these results are in agreement with the data presented in this study, which suggest a non-teichoic acid polysaccharide, either neutral or anionic, involved in the cell wall binding of slpa, but the detailed structure of this polysaccharide remains to be elucidated.

interestingly, despite the fact that polysaccharides rather than teichoic acids of l. brevis atcc  <dig> are involved in the cell wall binding of slpa, the c-terminal cell wall binding region of the s-layer protein cbsa of l. crispatus jcm  <dig> bound to ghcl-treated l. brevis atcc  <dig> cells  <cit> . using the same experimental design we showed that rslpa and its cell wall binding fragment rslpa1– <dig> bind to licl-treated l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> cells. the interaction between the s-layer protein and the secondary cell wall component is supposed to be lectin-like and highly specific  <cit> , and in artificial experimental procedures the lack of a specific interaction between two complementary surfaces may be masked by unspecific charge interactions with lower affinity. to obtain information about specific interactions, competition experiments with fragments of sa, cbsa and slpa and the corresponding bacterial strains, or direct determinations of the kd values of the interactions, e. g. by surface plasmon resonance studies, are needed.

amino acid sequence analysis of the l. brevis s-layer proteins revealed motifs with similarity to repeated c-terminal carbohydrate binding sequences detected in clostridial toxins, streptococcal glucosyltransferases and the s-layer proteins of l. acidophilus group organisms  <cit> . these motifs are supposed to play a general role in protein-carbohydrate interactions by acting as initial attachment sites and thus enabling the specific interactions to occur  <cit>  and may thus be partly responsible for the observed positive cross-binding results between slpa and l. acidophilus atcc  <dig> cells, and between the cell wall binding domain of cbsa and l. brevis atcc  <dig> cells . the sequences of the potential l. brevis carbohydrate-binding motifs deviated to some extent from the consensus sequences determined for clostridial toxins and streptococcal transferases  <cit> . the divergence of the sequences in distantly related organisms and different macromolecular structures is apparently allowed as long as the basic function of the motif, bringing the interacting partners to initial contact, is preserved.

the self-assembly domain of slpa was shown to comprise residues 179– <dig> in mature slpa, as truncated proteins encompassing this region were able to form a periodic structure indistinguishable from that formed by full length slpa, as detected by electron microscopy. the length of the truncated protein was critical, since rslpa167– <dig> and rslpa149– <dig> as well as n-terminal truncations shorter than rslpa179– <dig> were unable to form regular lattices. apparently, the region, or part of the region, encompassing amino acids 149– <dig> disturbs the lattice formation of the truncated proteins either by steric hindrance and/or by preventing the acquisition of a native conformation. trypsin degradation experiments revealed two protease resistant peptides encompassing residues 190– <dig> and 209– <dig> in mature slpa supporting the hypothesis about a morphologically separate, compact c-terminal unit, which most probably corresponds to the round, periodically arranged structures seen in electron microscope pictures of self-assembly products of slpa . similar trypsin degradation experiments with whole l. brevis cells resulted in identical fragments but at a very low efficiency , indicating poor accessibility of the enzyme to the n-terminal domain through the pores in the s-layer, and further supporting the presumption about a protease sensitive, more flexible n-terminal domain shielded from the environment beneath the c-terminal self-assembly domain. a protease-resistant, surface-located self-assembly domain has also been observed in the n-terminal part of the s-layer protein sa of l. acidophilus atcc  <dig>  <cit> . the results of the present study are supported by the report of hynönen et al  <cit> , in which an antiserum specific for the recombinant peptide slpa66– <dig>  originating from the cell wall binding region, was not able to recognize polymerized slpa on lactobacillus brevis atcc  <dig> cells. in the same report, whole s-layered l. brevis atcc  <dig> cells as well as the n-terminal part of slpa, residues 66– <dig> of mature slpa in minimum, were shown to bind to immobilized fibronectin. fibronectin is highly glycosylated, and the binding of fibronectin to a region of slpa shielded beneath the c-terminal domain may be explained by an interaction between the protruding oligosaccharide moieties of fibronectin and the identified n-terminal carbohydrate binding sequences of slpa. in this respect the identification of human blood group a-trisaccharide as the receptor for the s-layer protein of a human l. brevis isolate  <cit>  is of interest, especially considering that the nine n-terminal amino acids of the s-layer protein of this strain were identical with the n-terminus of slpa.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work slpa of l. brevis atcc  <dig> was shown to be a two-modular protein in which the domains responsible for the self-assembly  and cell wall binding  are located in a reverse order compared to those in all other lactobacillus s-layer proteins characterized thus far, reflecting the unrelatedness of slpa with previously characterized lactobacillus s-layer proteins. the study confirms the role of conserved, repeated, general carbohydrate binding sequences in the cell wall binding domains of lactobacillus s-layer proteins, but in contrast to the lactobacillus acidophilus-group organisms, the specific cell wall component interacting with the s-layer protein in l. brevis atcc  <dig> was shown to be other than teichoic acid. as slpa is a potential tool for mucosal immunization, the data presented in this study forms a basis for further studies concerning vaccine development. the mapping of surface exposed residues in the self-assembly domain of slpa is currently in progress.
