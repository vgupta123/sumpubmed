BACKGROUND
viral vectors are used as tools to introduce genes or short-hairpin rnas  into the brain in order to unravel the role of genes. the advantages of viral vectors are that they can be injected locally and that they establish long term expression of a gene or shrna. several viral vectors have been tested in vivo in the central nervous system, such as adeno-associated viral , lentiviral , adenoviral  and herpes simplex viral  vectors  <cit> . to date, studies in the rodent hypothalamus and amygdala mainly have used aav or adv and to a lesser extent lv vectors  <cit> . in this study we compared the transduction efficiencies of aav and lv vectors. the lv and aav vector used in this study both used the cmv promoter to drive the expression of a fluorescent marker, dsred or gfp respectively. the aav and lv vectors were pseudotyped; the aav vector was pseudotyped with aav <dig> and the lv vector was pseudotyped with vsv-g. to date, at least  <dig> serotypes of aav are discovered   <cit>  that probably use different receptors to enter cells  <cit> . nevertheless, for most serotypes the cell entry receptors are still unknown. until now the most widely used serotype is aav <dig>  however, recent studies have shown that aav <dig> and aav <dig> coated vectors transduce more neurons than aav <dig> coated vectors in vivo in several brain areas, such as the rat striatum, hippocampus, midbrain  <cit> . we have chosen to use an aav <dig> pseudotyped vector, because we previously have shown that this serotype is more efficient in transduction of neurons in the adult rat hypothalamus than an aav <dig> encapsidated vector  <cit> . for the lv vector we chose the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein , because it was shown to have a broad tropism for all kinds of neurons. however there are also other envelope proteins which can be used to pseudotype lv vectors and target the cns  <cit> .

it is important to know which viral vector, aav or lv, is most efficient in transduction of brain areas involved in energy homeostasis, because then it is possible to efficiently alter gene expression in specific brain nuclei to further investigate the function of genes involved in feeding behavior. the lateral hypothalamus  and amygdala  are important brain areas involved in energy homeostasis  <cit> . previously, we have shown that aav vectors can be used to alter behavior in rats. aav-mediated overexpression of neuropeptide y, agouti and agouti-related peptide in the hypothalamus increased parameters such as body weight and food intake  <cit> . however, a study by another group showed that lv vectors can be also used to alter gene expression in the hypothalamus and thereby alter body weight  <cit> . thus, aav and lv vectors are able to change gene expression and behavior after transduction of neurons in the rat hypothalamus. however, it is unclear whether aav or lv vectors are more efficient in transduction of the rat hypothalamus or amygdala. therefore, this study compared the transduction efficiencies of a lv and an aav vector in the lh and am of adult rats.

RESULTS
in vitro testing of antibodies
to confirm that gfp and dsred antibodies were able to detect the respective proteins with similar efficiencies, 293t cells were transfected with constructs encoding for cmv-gfp and/or cmv-dsred . since the promoter driving the expression of the fluorescent proteins was the same, we expected similar levels of expression. the endogenous fluorescence of gfp and dsred was compared with the immunostained fluorescence. the cells transfected with only one construct showed co-localization of endogenous fluorescence and immunostained fluorescence . in addition, cells co-transfected with cmv-gfp and cmv-dsred showed co-localization of both immunohistochemistry signals . the pictures showed that red fluorescent signals, endogenous or immunostained, were at least threefold stronger in intensity than green fluorescent signals.

aav1-gfp and lv-dsred transduction in vitro
the aav-gfp plasmid was pseudotyped with an aav <dig> coat, because that coat was previously shown to be more effective in transduction of hypothalamic nuclei, such as the lh, than aav <dig> coated vectors  <cit> . it is still unknown which entry receptors aav <dig> uses to enter cells and it is therefore unknown which cell line is most optimal for determining transducing units. nevertheless, we performed a serial dilution with aav1-gfp on ht- <dig> cells to obtain an indication of transducing units. these results showed that the titer of aav1-gfp was  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u./ml, which is substantially lower than the  <dig>  ×  <dig> g.c./ml. the lv-dsred had a titer of  <dig>  ×  <dig> t.u./ml.

before mixing the two viruses, the preparations were diluted. aav was diluted to  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> g.c./μl, thus  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> t.u./μl on ht- <dig> respectively. lv-dsred was diluted to  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u./μl. subsequently the diluted viruses were mixed 1: <dig> and  <dig> μl of this mix was injected in each brain area. this resulted in  <dig> ×  <dig> or  <dig> ×  <dig> g.c.  of aav1-gfp and  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u. of lv-dsred per site.

transduction of the lh by aav1-gfp and lv-dsred
to determine the transduction efficiencies of aav and lv vectors in the lh the animals were perfused four weeks after injection with viral vectors. immunostaining for gfp and dsred showed positive staining in the injection tract. these were probably apoptotic cells and were not included in our quantification . counting of all gfp and dsred immunostained positive cells revealed that aav1-gfp, at  <dig> ×  <dig> g.c., transduced significantly more cells in the lh compared with lv-gfp, at  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u. . the total area transduced by aav1-gfp at the injection site was  <dig>  μm <dig> and an area of  <dig>  μm <dig> was transduced by lv-dsred. as expected, an increase in titer of aav1-gfp from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> g.c. in the lh resulted in  <dig> -fold increase in the area transduced at the injection site; the total transduced area at the injection site increased from  <dig>  μm <dig> to  <dig>  μm <dig> . in the lh aav1-gfp predominantly transduced neurons, because gfp and neun co-localize  and lv-dsred probably also transduced mainly neurons, because dsred and gfap did not co-localize .

transduction of the am by aav1-gfp and lv-dsred
in addition, we studied the transduction efficiencies of aav1-gfp and lv-dsred in the am . similar to the lh, aav1-gfp transduced significantly more cells than lv-dsred in the am . the number of cells transduced by aav <dig> or lv in the am was comparable to the numbers transduced in the lh. in the am aav <dig> and lv vector also predominantly transduced neurons, however some cells transduced with aav1-gfp did not co-localize with neun and had a microglia appearance.

discussion
this study showed that an aav <dig> vector transduced significantly more cells in the lh and am of rats than a lv-vsv-g vector. this is in agreement previous studies which showed low levels of transgene expression after injection of  <dig> μl of lv vectors in other rat brain nuclei, namely the red nucleus  <cit>  and the retina  <cit> . in contrast, several studies reported substantial levels of transduction by lv in the rat striatum and hippocampus, however, these groups injected larger volumes of lv, namely  <dig> or  <dig> μl  <cit> . in addition, lv vectors have been reported to efficiently transduce cells in the mouse hippocampus and striatum  <cit>  and aav and lv vectors were reported to transduce approximately similar numbers of cells after injection in mouse hippocampus or hippocampal slices  <cit> . these data indicate that there may be species differences and/or brain area differences, which may contribute to variations in transduction efficiencies by lv and aav vectors in rat and mouse brain.

the titer of our aav1-gfp preparation was  <dig>  ×  <dig> g.c./ml, which is a titer in the range that we usually obtain with aav production. the number of transducing units/ml will be lower than genomic copies/ml since not all vector dna is properly packaged into infectious particles. the optimal cell line for determining the t.u./ml of aav <dig> preparations is unknown. we assessed the t.u./ml of aav1-gfp on ht- <dig> cell line. the titer of aav1-gfp was  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u./ml, and this prep was diluted  <dig> times, to  <dig>  ×  <dig> t.u./μl before mixing with lv-dsred. the lv-dsred was only diluted  <dig> times to  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u./μl. since the number of t.u. of aav1-gfp injected was much lower than the t.u. of lv-dsred, we conclude that aav <dig> is more efficient in transduction of the lh and am than lv-vsv-g. however, it has to be kept in mind that comparison of t.u. of lv-vsv-g and aav <dig> vector preparations on cell lines is complicated, because the vectors probably use different, still unknown, entry receptors and different cell lines have different surface receptors. for example, one dose of aav1/ <dig> vectors has different t.u. values on different cell lines  <cit> . in addition, the t.u. of lv-dsred preparation was assessed in the presence of polybrene, which enhances transduction  <cit> , however, polybrene was not added when lv-dsred was injected in vivo.

in the lh aav1-gfp at  <dig> ×  <dig> g.c. al ready transduced more cells than lv-dsred. when the titer of aav1-gfp was increased a ten-fold, the area transduced and the numbers of neurons transduced were increased accordingly. this indicates that increasing the titer is a valid method to increase the number of transduced neurons.

we only observed 6- <dig> dsred positive cells after injection of  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u. of lv. thus, ideally the titer of lv-dsred should be increased to transduce more cells in the lh and am. the methods we used for lv preparation and titer determination are standard procedures in the field. normally, titers of concentrated lv vectors are reported to be in the range of  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> t.u./ml  <cit> . thus compared with results from others,  <dig>  ×  <dig> t.u./ml is a high titer. therefore, it is technically difficult to increase the lv titer to transduce more neurons in the am and lh of rats.

the differences in transduction by aav1-gfp and lv-dsred in the lh and am may be explained by the fact that the vectors probably used different receptors to enter cells. the lv-dsred used in this study was pseudotyped with vsv-g. vsv-g transduces many cell types from different species, but it is still unknown how vsv-g enters these cells. for a long time it was thought that phosphatidylserine  was the receptor to mediate membrane fusion  <cit> . however, more recent data indicated that ps is not the entry receptor  <cit> . aav-gfp was pseudotyped with aav <dig> capsid proteins. the entry receptor for aav <dig> also is unknown, but there are indications that α- <dig>  and α- <dig>  n-linked sialic acids facilitate transduction by aav <dig> vectors  <cit> .

exchanging gfp and dsred genes between lv and aav vector  probably will not alter the transduction efficiencies which we observed in this study, since the promoter and other parts of the vectors including the viral coat are unchanged. previous studies have compared expression of gfp and dsred in lv or aav vectors and showed that the expression profile remained the same when only the fluorescent markers were changed; co-injection of two vectors  showed that expression of both vectors largely overlapped  <cit> .

the co-localization of aav <dig> and neun showed that aav <dig> predominantly transduced neurons in the lh and am. this is in agreement with previous studies which showed that aav <dig> predominantly transduced neurons in different rat brain regions at all investigated time points after injection  <cit> . the lv and gfap immunohistochemistry signals did not co-localize indicating that lv at  <dig> weeks post-injection probably transduced neurons. this confirms data from previous studies where lv predominantly co-localized with neun in the rat brain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
when a substantial part or the entire lh or am of rats needs to be transduced aav <dig> vectors are preferred over lv vectors, since more neurons can be transduced with aav <dig> than with lv-vsv-g vectors and the titer of aav preparations can easily be increased.
