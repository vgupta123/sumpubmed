BACKGROUND
iron is essential for numerous biological oxidation-reduction reactions in plants and plays a central catalytic role in all primary metabolic processes, including chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport, nitrogen assimilation, and a large number of other anabolic and catabolic reactions  <cit> . in an oxidizing environment, the concentration of soluble fe3+ is low and the fe that is present is available to the cell typically in the form of ferric chelates. the mechanism for fe uptake in arabidopsis and all other dicotyledonous and non-grass monocotyledonous plants involves the reduction of fe3+, release of fe2+ from a chelate, and uptake of the liberated fe2+ by the cell . in arabidopsis, the plasma membrane-bound fe3+-chelate reductase fro <dig> catalyzes the reduction of fe3+ at the cell surface  <cit> . homologues of fro <dig> have been found in other strategy i plants such as pea  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and cucumber  <cit> . the fe2+ is then taken up by an fe-deficiency-regulated transporter of the zip family, irt <dig>  <cit> . in addition to transcriptional regulation, irt <dig> and fro <dig> are subject to posttranslational regulation, indicating the importance of an exact and rapid response by adjusting the amount of protein appropriate to the fe demand in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus amounts of fe  <cit> . the coordinated functions of irt <dig> and fro <dig> are principally responsible for fe uptake in arabidopsis roots  <cit> .

research in the regulation of the fe deficiency response in plants has generated intense interest. the first insights into the nature of this regulation were based on the early discovery of the fer mutant in tomato  <cit> . the fer mutant  was unable to initiate the typical responses to fe deficiency, including enhanced extrusion of protons, proliferation of root hairs, and fe3+-chelate reductase activity. furthermore, relatively low fe concentrations  in the growth media were lethal  <cit> . the fer gene encodes a bhlh transcription factor that is expressed in roots and root tips but not in the leaves or upper hypocotyls  <cit> . the expression of fer was not greatly altered in tomato plants grown with  <dig>  or  <dig> Î¼m fe. thus in tomato, fer is expressed in a root-specific and largely fe-independent manner.

in arabidopsis, fit  was discovered as a fer homolog responsible for regulating the fe deficiency response  <cit> . the genes fro <dig> and irt <dig> were found to be regulated by fit, which also controls the expression of a total of  <dig> genes with known or putative functions in fe homeostasis  <cit> . the transcriptional factor fit was itself regulated by fe deficiency; however, constitutive expression of fit under the control of a 35s promoter did not alter the expression patterns of irt <dig> and fro <dig>  nor was the fe content in the fit over-expressing plants altered compared to controls  <cit> . it was concluded that fit is necessary but not sufficient for regulation of the fe deficiency response in arabidopsis. recently, it was demonstrated that fit interacts with two bhlh transcription factors, atbhlh <dig> and atbhlh <dig>  <cit> . the over-expression of fit with either atbhlh <dig> or atbhlh <dig> resulted in the constitutive expression of both irt <dig> and fro <dig> and the increased accumulation of fe compared to controls. the function of atbhlh <dig> and atbhlh <dig> was shown by t-dna insertion mutations to be redundant  <cit> . these results have led to the conclusion that an as yet unidentified cis-element is responsible for the fe-deficiency-associated regulation of irt <dig> and fro <dig> among other genes.

as in arabidopsis, the mechanism of perception of fe deficiency in grasses is still unknown. the cis-acting elements ide <dig> and ide <dig>  which are presumably responsible for fe-deficiency-inducible expression, have been identified in the promoter region of the barley ids <dig> gene  <cit> . a constitutively expressed transcription factor, idef <dig> belonging to the abi3/vp <dig> family, has been shown to specifically bind to ide <dig>  and over-expression of idef <dig> led to the induction of the bhlh transcription factor osiro <dig>  <cit> . osiro <dig> expression was also induced by fe deficiency, and osiro <dig> itself has been shown to bind to the cis-element 5'-cacgtgg-3'  <cit> . this cis-element was found in the promoters of a number of genes involved in fe uptake in grasses. in particular, osiro <dig> was shown to be required for the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in phytosiderophore synthesis and two transcription factor genes, osnac <dig> and a gene encoding an ap <dig> domain-binding protein. these later two transcription factors appeared to be regulated directly by osiro <dig>  <cit> .

recently, a transcription factor belonging to the nac family, idef <dig>  was found to bind specifically to the ide <dig> element  <cit> . nac transcription factors are a plant-specific family, which have been implicated in developmental responses to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . idef <dig> transcripts were constitutively expressed in shoots and roots and were not greatly altered under fe deficiency. reduction of idef <dig> transcript abundance by rnai under conditions of fe deficiency resulted in a considerable reduction in transcript abundance of the fe-phytosiderophore transporter osysl <dig>  at present, it appears that in grasses, the fe-deficiency signal is mediated by at least two constitutively expressed transcription factors that under conditions of fe deficiency, initiate a transcriptional cascade of events that lead to the adaptive responses to fe deficiency.

there are similarities in the response pathway to fe deficiency in arabidopsis and rice , and based on our current knowledge, it is reasonable to expect a higher complexity in the response chain in arabidopsis. the elucidation of regulatory components is rendered more difficult by the lack of knowledge on the temporal pattern of their expression. we present here a detailed time-course analysis of the short-term transcriptional changes induced by fe deficiency by using dna microarrays. we demonstrate that the majority of transcriptional changes were established within the first six hours after subjecting the plants to fe deficiency. the transcriptional changes include most of the previously reported transcriptional changes in response to fe deficiency but also novel transcripts that are likely to be important in transduction of the fe deficiency response in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
the characterization of rapid responses to fe deficiency at the transcriptome level requires a growth system that permits rapid removal of fe from the media. recently, various groups have published dna microarray experiments using plants grown on agarose plates. initiation of fe deficiency was accomplished by transferring to fe-deficient media, often in the presence of a fe2+ chelator. although widely used, the inherent drawbacks of the agar plate system include, inducing physical injuries to the plants during transferring, the roots carry-over of residual amounts of fe-containing agarose, thus making the time-point of fe deficiency difficult to determine, and lastly, the use of chelators that may affect the partitioning of metals across the plasma membrane independent of fe deficiency. in the present study, we have used a well-characterized hydroponic system to analyze the fe-deficiency response  <cit> . the system allowed the bulk transfer of a large number of plants with intact roots into fe-sufficient or fe-deficient media within seconds and with minimal mechanical damage. our approach allows for a time-dependent monitoring of fe deficiency-induced transcriptional changes with a clear-cut onset of the exposure to fe-free media. we have used this system to generate materials used in the present study.

time-course of fe deficiency-induced alterations in transcript abundance
to characterize the early response of transcript abundance to the removal of fe from the growth media, differential gene expression was determined by dna microarray analysis following  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of fe-deficient growth. for an initial characterization of the response to fe deficiency, the genes were extracted from the data base that had a p-value of <  <dig>  and a fold change of > 50%. these results are summarized in venn diagrams for up- and down-regulated transcripts at very early  and early  time-points following removal of fe . with only one exception, changes in transcript abundance at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h were limited to a single time point, and the differentially expressed genes that were detected immediately after transfer or after  <dig>  or  <dig> h of fe-deficient growth were not persistent over time. an examination of the over- or under-represented gene ontogeny categories  showed no categories that were indicative of a response to fe deficiency . for these reasons, the genes showing differential expression at the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h time points were considered to be fe-unspecific responses.

treatment
a transcript intensity was determined and differentially expressed genes  with an uncorrected p <  <dig>  and a change in intensity between fe-sufficient and fe-deficient treatments of 50% were selected for each of the five time points analyzed. biological processes and molecular functions were determined as being over-expressed when a corrected p <  <dig>  was determined. the correction for false discovery rates was determined with bingo software using the method of benjamini and hochberg  <cit> .

based on the total number of genes analyzed, approximately  <dig> % of the transcripts were changed in abundance after  <dig> h of fe-deficient growth. furthermore, approximately 50% of the transcripts that showed a significant change in abundance after  <dig> h were already differentially expressed by  <dig> h . the go categories that contained more than two members and that were over-represented at  <dig> and  <dig> h fe deficiency were associated with cation transport processes and fe homeostasis . the  <dig> gene transcripts that were unique to the  <dig> h time-point showed no over-representation in ontogeny categories; whereas the transcripts unique to  <dig> h showed over-represented gene ontogeny categories for co/zn detoxification, nicotianamine metabolism and cu transport . it was, however, clear that the early response to fe deficiency was initiated between  <dig> and  <dig> h of growth under fe-deficient conditions.

clustering of fe-deficiency changes in gene expression
to further characterize the response to fe deficiency in a time-course manner, all data for transcript abundance at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h fe deficiency were subjected to a cluster analysis using k-means methods with the algorithm as described previously  <cit> . the cluster stability was determined using the "benhur" function found in the clusterstab package of the bioconductor software . apart from a two-cluster model that was not useful in analyzing the response to fe deficiency, a six-cluster model generated the smallest number of clusters that gave the most stable results following multiple resorting. therefore, the six-cluster model was used for further analysis. clusters one and six showed transcripts with decreasing and increasing abundance during fe-deficient growth, respectively . the significance of these trends was confirmed by a comparison of the transcript frequency in the top  <dig> statistically most altered transcripts with the frequency of transcripts in each cluster. the transcripts in cluster one and six were approximately 9- and greater than 60-fold overrepresented, respectively. cluster four was slightly overrepresented in the top  <dig> transcripts, while the remaining clusters were slightly underrepresented. clusters one and six clearly contained the majority of transcripts that were responding to fe deficiency.

the fine structure of clusters one and six was investigated using heatmap diagrams and hierarchical clustering methods using euclidian distances . only transcripts with a p <  <dig>  were investigated. the transcript abundance in cluster one decreased during fe-deficient growth. the decrease was weakly apparent after  <dig> h fe-deficient growth and clearly evident at  <dig> and  <dig> h. the kinetic behavior of individual transcripts was similar, with a small group of three transcripts showing a more pronounced response . prominent among the down-regulated transcripts in this group were the three ferritin genes, bacterial-type hemoglobin  and the zip <dig> transporter. these genes have functions in fe storage, binding and transport . the biological processes of fe transport and stimulus and the molecular functions of fe binding and cu and zn transport were significantly over-represented in the genes showing a decrease in abundance . interestingly, an over-representation in transcripts that encode proteins presumably localized in plastids was observed. not surprisingly however, these transcripts included the ferritin genes but also components of the reductive pentose cycle.

a listed are the genes in cluster  <dig> that showed a significantly  decreased transcript abundance in response to fe deficiency. the appearance in the list  corresponds to the order shown in figure  <dig>  gene annotation is based on the  <dig>  release of the arabidopsis genome.

the genes found in cluster six, which contained transcripts that responded with increasing abundance following removal of fe, could be divided into two subgroups by hierarchical clustering of approximately equal size. the first of these responded to fe deficiency rapidly and with high increases in abundance already after  <dig> h of fe deficiency . a tendency for increased abundance was apparent after  <dig> h; although, this increase was not significant in all cases. both of these groups contained a number of transcripts that were known to respond to fe deficiency, including irt <dig>  irt <dig>  fro <dig> and some bhlh transcription factors . genes encoding transport proteins and transcription factors were prominently represented in this group.

a listed are the genes that showed a significantly  increased in transcript abundance in response to fe deficiency and whose intensity was shown in figure  <dig> . the list was sorted  to corresponds to the order shown in figure  <dig>  gene annotation is based on the tair  <dig>  release of the arabidopsis genome.

the second subgroup in cluster six responded more slowly to fe deficiency and showed a significant increase in transcript abundance at  <dig> h of fe-deficient growth with only slight increases after  <dig> h. the increases after  <dig> h fe-deficient growth were in most cases not significant . the behavior of this subgroup to fe deficiency was similar to approximately one-third of the transcripts grouped into cluster four . when all clusters with a significantly increased abundance under fe deficiency were re-clustered, the group belonging to cluster four transcripts was associated with cluster six . the genes responding more slowly to fe deficiency and belonging to cluster six are listed in table  <dig> and those belonging to cluster four in table  <dig>

summarizing the general behavior of transcripts with increased abundance under fe deficiency, go categories related to the transport of fe, cu, oligopeptides and amino acids were strongly over-represented . transcripts annotated to response to zn and to detoxification of zn and co were predominant in this group. furthermore, cellular components associated with the vacuole were over-represented, indicating the important role of the vacuole in the fe-deficiency response.

analysis of the differential response to fe deficiency at the transcript level
the transcripts reported in table  <dig> showed the greatest response to fe deficiency based on fold-induction of any of the transcripts that were identified to be differentially regulated by fe supply. to confirm the response of a portion of these transcripts to fe deficiency, the transcript abundance of nine randomly chosen genes from table  <dig> was analyzed by semi-quantitative pcr following fe-deficient growth for  <dig> h and following fe re-supply. as a well documented fe response gene, fro <dig> was included in the analysis for reference. in agreement with the published data, fro <dig> and irt <dig> were strongly up-regulated at  <dig> h following the removal of fe from the growth medium . with the re-supply of fe, transcript abundance for these genes remained elevated over the subsequent  <dig> h compared to the fe-sufficient controls. in two cases, at5g <dig> and at4g <dig>  the response to fe deficiency was generally weak and a clear response was not consistently observed. all other genes tested were strongly up-regulated under conditions of fe deficiency, thus confirming the results of the microarray experiments. following the re-supply of fe, the transcript abundance of these individuals decreased rapidly after  <dig> h of re-supply, and in most cases no or only weak signals were observed after  <dig> h of fe re-supply.

a quantitative validation of the microarray experiments was performed by real-time rt-pcr. the time-course of expression of six genes identified as being strongly induced by fe deficiency  was monitored over the experimental period . the changes in transcript abundance corresponded well with the gene chip signals, thus validating the data obtained from the microarray experiments.

discussion
transcript abundance changes rapidly in response to fe deficiency
the general response of plants to fe deficiency has been well documented, particularly with regards to arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . it is still, however, largely unclear how the fe status of the plant is perceived and which cellular components might be involved in signal perception. in many of the previous studies of gene expression during the response to fe deficiency in arabidopsis, plants were cultivated on agar plates and transferred to plates lacking fe and often supplemented with a ferrous chelator to induce the response to fe deficiency. in our opinion, the disadvantages to this approach are three fold. first, the agar plate method of induces more mechanical damage to the roots as a result of transfer, second, the inevitable contamination of a variable amount of fe-containing agar that was carried over during transfer, and last, the harsh side effects of extraction with ferrous chelates. in order to overcome these adverse effects, we have carried out the experiments using a hydroponics system that has been employed previously  <cit> . this system allows simultaneous transfer of a large number of plants to fe-free media with little mechanical damage to the root system. our current analysis of global gene expression during the early phases of the fe-deficiency response demonstrated that the changes in transcript abundance relevant to the adaptive fe stress response are occurring at the  <dig> h time point and time points following . in preliminary analyses that formed the basis of the investigation presented here, we determined the transcript abundance of representative genes that are known to respond to fe deficiency . the result of that study showed that although changes in transcript abundance of fe responsive genes could be observed at time-point prior to  <dig> h, the response at and prior to  <dig> h was variable and the changes in transcript abundance that were observed did not persist . differential expression was observed immediately following transfer and after  <dig>  and  <dig> h of growth in fe-depleted hydroponic culture media. however, these changes were restricted to individual time-points and the change were not continuous between the early time-points. in fact, a large overlap in significantly changed gene expression was only observed between  <dig> and  <dig> h fe-deficient growth .

the results from our study correspond well with a previous microarray analysis on the fit mutant by colangelo and guerinot  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes that were identified by the previous study as being responsive to fe deficiency with increased transcript abundance,  <dig> were also found in the present study. these  <dig> genes were distributed between early and late responding transcripts.

rapid transcriptional changes are associated with fe uptake and distribution
considering the fe deficiency-dependent and time-dependent changes in transcript abundance, we have identified  <dig> genes whose abundance was decreased and  <dig> whose abundance was increased over the  <dig> h period. the decreased abundance in transcripts encoding two nodulin-like proteins  was of particular interest, because these proteins contain a domain belonging to the ccc1-like family. the family of proteins with this domain includes a yeast vacuolar transmembrane protein  that has been shown to transport fe and mn from the cytosol into vacuole  <cit>  and vit <dig>  a ccc <dig> homolog in arabidopsis that has been shown to be an influx fe transporter on the vacuolar membrane  <cit> . if the function of the two nodulin-like proteins were similar to vit <dig>  then the decreased abundance of these transcripts would be associated with a decreased capacity of the cell to store fe in the vacuole. the decreased abundance in the three transcripts encoding ferritins was also easily understood in the context of fe mobilization in response to deficiency.

somewhat puzzling was the presence of three transcripts encoding chloroplast proteins in the group of most significantly down-regulated transcripts . at3g <dig> encodes one of the two subunits of the chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . this gene has been shown to be coordinately expressed with the phosphoribulokinase gene  and cp12- <dig> genes; however, in our study the three cp12- <dig> and the prk genes showed no significant changes in response to fe deficiency . at2g <dig> encodes a protein similar to subunit w of the photosystem ii reaction center, and at2g <dig> encodes lhcb <dig> , a member of the family of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding . how these transcripts might be involved in the root response to fe deficiency is not known.

in contrast to the genes that displayed decreasing transcript abundance in response to fe deficiency, gene which showed an increased in abundance formed a larger more heterogeneous group. they were subdivided further based on cluster analysis. one of these groups responded more rapidly the fe deficiency  than the other . as stated above, genes encoding fe transporters, transcription factors and fe-containing proteins were prominent among these up-regulated transcripts. with regard to metal transporters, the most rapidly responding transcripts were those encoding the fe uptake transporters , the fe3+-chelate reductase fro <dig>  <cit> , and the oligopeptide-fe transporter opt <dig>  <cit> . the transcript abundance of nramp <dig>  a vacuolar fe efflux carrier  <cit> , and of ferroportin, a putative fe efflux carrier of unknown location  <cit> , was increased at the  <dig> h time point but not before. thus, based on the results of the present study, we suggest that the response of arabidopsis to fe deficiency was to increase and maintain the capacity for fe uptake in the cytoplasm.

recently, an investigation of the transcriptional response of arabidopsis roots to abiotic stress, including the response to fe deficiency, has been performed by dinneny et al. using a cell sorting approach to increase the resolution of the analysis  <cit> . upon reprocessing the microarray data published in that study using the methods and criteria concurrent with our own investigation, it was revealed that the number of transcripts which show a significant change was greater than  <dig>  in contrast to less than  <dig> transcripts in the present study. while a considerable overlap was also found between the two studies, the individuals identified by dinneny et al.  <cit>  generally appeared after a longer exposure to fe deficiency in the present study. in contrast, the differences in the respective studies can most likely be attributed to the different method of culturing the plants used in the experiments. however, possibly as a result of the high resolution of their systems, the majority of the transcripts identified in the dinneny et al.  <cit>  study appears to have no clear connection to the known responses to fe deficiency and may represent, at least partly, biological signals unrelated to the fe-deficiency response.

fe deficiency induces rapid changes in zn homeostasis
in addition to regulation of fe transporter abundance under fe deficiency, transcripts corresponding to zn transporters were regulated under fe deficiency. in this case, transcripts for the zn plasma membrane efflux carrier, mtpc <dig>  <cit> , and the vacuolar influx carrier, mtpa <dig>  <cit> , were strongly and rapidly increased, while transcripts for the zn plasma membrane influx carrier, zip <dig>  were decreased. at the  <dig> h time-point, transcripts for the zn vacuolar influx carrier, zif <dig>  <cit> , were also increased. the effect of fe deficiency was not restricted to fe and zn. a cu transporter  <cit>  was rapidly increased and the fe-regulated ni transport was slowly increased  <cit> . zip <dig>  has been shown to be a zn transporter that catalyzed zn uptake when heterologically expressed in yeast  <cit> . zip <dig> responded to zn deficiency  <cit> , but a role for zip <dig> in fe transport has not been shown.

CONCLUSIONS
a summary of the effects of fe deficiency on ion transport in the cell is presented in figure  <dig>  assuming that the regulation of transcript abundance is also reflected in altered ion fluxes in the cell, the response of the cell is to increase cytosolic fe through increased influx into the cytosol and decreased efflux into the vacuole. on the other hand, rapid regulation of the gene transcripts mtpc <dig> and mtpa <dig> indicates changes associated with divalent cation homeostasis and have the effect of decreasing divalent cation influx into and increasing efflux out of the cytosol. the response of the cell to an increase cytosolic fe concentration under conditions of fe deficiency could be easily understood, whereas the opposite reaction to a reduction in the cytosolic zn concentration is more difficult to explain. perhaps under fe deficiency the capacity for zn uptake exceeded the nutritional requirement of the cells, and the cytosolic uptake as well as the efflux capacity was adjusted to establish a new zn homeostasis. the specificity of the plant metal transporters may be the molecular cause for the deregulation of metal ion homeostasis during fe deficiency. recently, it was reported that a correlation between fe deficiency and increased shoot concentrations of zn, mn and co  <cit> . fe-deficient arabidopsis roots accumulated high concentrations of co, mn and zn compared to nutrient sufficient controls  <cit> . thus, a side effect of increasing the fe uptake capacity is a concomitant uptake other metals via the irt <dig> transporter, when the availability of fe in the media is low.

the re-supply of fe to fe-deficient plants did not in all cases lead to a rapid down-regulation of genes which are highly induced by fe-deficiency. in some cases, e.g. for bhlh <dig> and bhlh <dig> re-induction was observed  <dig> h after fe resupply after an initial repression by fe after  <dig> h. such an effect has been previously described for irt <dig> and fro <dig> and attributed to in the regulation of fe-responsive genes by both local and systemic signals  <cit> . our data demonstrate that this regulation is not restricted to irt <dig> and fro <dig>  but also include genes with regulatory function.
