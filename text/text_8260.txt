BACKGROUND
peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases  play a role in protein folding and function by twisting the backbone of target proteins. ppiases are abundantly expressed in virtually all organisms and all cellular compartments  <cit> . one subclass of ppiases are parvulins, a group of enzymes involved in mitotic regulatory mechanisms and cell proliferation  <cit> . the human genome contains two parvulin genes. one encodes the well studied mitotic regulator pin <dig>  which isomerizes phosphorylated ser/thr-pro motifs  <cit>  and thereby is involved in a variety of cellular processes and conditions such as cell cycle regulation, cancer and alzheimer's disease  <cit> ; the other, the par14/pin <dig> locus on chromosome xq <dig> , gives rise to two protein species, par <dig> and par <dig>  <cit> . par <dig>   <cit>  is assumed to be involved in cell cycle progression or chromatin remodeling  <cit> . par14-like protein sequences are found in all multicellular organisms but are absent from yeasts  <cit> . although par <dig> cannot rescue the lethal phenotype of ess <dig> deletion, which is the only parvulin-type ppiase in yeast  <cit> , uchida and co-workers proposed a compensating function for par <dig> upon pin <dig> inhibition or deletion in mammalian cells  <cit> . par <dig> displays only very weak ppiase activity towards peptidic substrates  <cit>  and hence might also perform cellular regulatory functions other than pin <dig>  the par <dig> protein was initially detected within the nucleus, cytosol and mitochondria of human hek  <dig> cells  <cit> , but how this distribution was accomplished remained to be determined. its distribution between the nucleus and cytosol  <cit>  was described to be regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner  <cit>  and deletion studies pointed to a nuclear import signal within the positively charged n-terminal section  <cit> . within the nucleus, par <dig> was reported to bind to pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles  <cit> , and sequence-specifically to bent double-stranded dna  <cit> . the basic n-terminal part was indispensable for high affinity dna binding  <cit> . such bent at-rich segments of dna are supposed to dictate nucleosome positioning  <cit>  and play a role in transcription initiation.

par <dig> is a recently described protein species  <cit>  also encoded by the par14/pin <dig> locus on chromosome xq <dig> . its elongated mrna originates from alternative transcription initiation and occurs in all human tissues tested so far  <cit> . the 5'extension includes a  <dig> bp extended open reading frame whose expression was confirmed by in vitro translation reaction and by western blotting of human hela and hepg <dig> cell lysates  <cit> . due to its molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, the novel parvulin was denoted as par <dig> following the e. coli par <dig> and human par <dig> nomenclature. the longer parvulin protein is encoded within the human genome but is absent from rodent, bovine and non-mammalian genomes  <cit> .

the present study shows that par <dig> occurs only in genomes from great apes species , but not in those of other primates, as shown by parvulin sequences from different primate genomic dna samples. par <dig> is directed to mitochondria by the novel n-terminal domain that functions as non-cleavable mitochondrial targeting peptide. the protein associates with mitochondrial surfaces and is transported into the matrix in a time and membrane potential-dependent manner. par <dig> binds to double-stranded dna at physiological salt concentrations as par <dig> does. par <dig> is thus a hominid-specific dna-binding constituent of the mitochondrial matrix that has not been detected in any recent mitochondrial proteomic studies. in addition, the prepeptide represents the most recently evolved functional mitochondrial targeting peptide known to date.

RESULTS
par <dig> occurrence in anthropoid genomic sequences
within the human genome, the parvulin/pin <dig> locus on chromosome xq <dig>  encodes an elongated open reading frame leading to the expression of par <dig> . this elongation was already reported to be absent from bovine and rodent genomes  <cit> . the chimpanzee genome sequence  <cit>  contained a gap at the corresponding locus preventing a comparison to other genomic parvulin sequences. surprisingly, the macaque genome that became publicly available at that time did not contain an extended par <dig>  therefore, further analysis of the occurrence of an elongated parvulin within the genomes of anthropoid species became of interest as par17's extension must have been acquired during anthropoid evolution.

as the presequence was not encoded by an additional exon, but a 5' extension of exon  <dig>  phylogenetic studies could be performed on genomic dna eliminating the need for fresh primate material for mrna isolation. genomic dna from  <dig> different anthropoid species covering new world monkeys , old world monkeys  and apes  were obtained from ecacc. these genomic dna samples originated from stable anthropoid cell lines. primers were designed to fit to primate sequences upon comparison of the human genomic sequence with the macaque genome. a fragment of the elongated exon  <dig> starting directly upstream of the par <dig> atg and including part of the par <dig> coding sequence was pcr amplified from all these primate sequences. exon  <dig> is conserved in all mammals including mouse, with only two amino acid exchanges between humans and rodents, and was used as positive control. hence, genomic mouse dna could serve as an ideal control for the existence of a parvulin gene  and the absence of an elongation . uniform pcr products of the expected size were obtained in all reactions with genomic dna templates, except for mouse exon 1; these products were all gel purified, cloned and sequenced. the human and macaque sequences for exon  <dig> as well as human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse sequences for exon  <dig> were identical to the respective ensembl genomic sequences.

dna sequence alignments together with putative translation products are shown in figure 1a,c for the analyzed parts of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, displaying high conservation within exon  <dig> and remarkable sequence changes within exon  <dig>  the par <dig> n-terminal domain is preformed in the dna sequences of all anthropoids; additional atg codons at the putative starting position of par <dig> exist as well. however, they are out-of-frame in all old world and new world monkey species. several mutational rearrangements shift the presequence in-frame with par <dig> allowing the expression of par <dig> only in the hominid sequences . although the two atg codons are in-frame within the gibbon sequence, an interspersed taa stop codon prevents an elongated open reading frame. the sequence changes between different primate species are summarized in a schematic representation of their phylogenetic relationship .

the n-terminal extension of par <dig> includes an amphipatic α-helix
the par <dig> protein differs from par <dig> within the n-terminus by  <dig> additional amino acids. the n-terminal par <dig> sequence from met <dig> to ala <dig> is predicted to adopt an α-helical conformation  by the secondary structure prediction package nps  <cit> . when drawn as helical wheel, the amphipatic character of this part of par <dig> becomes obvious, with lys <dig>  arg <dig>  glu <dig>  arg <dig> and lys <dig> on the one side and met <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig> and phe <dig> on the other . the coupled snps  resulting in q16r and r18s substitutions  <cit>  within the predicted α-helix do not compromise the amphipatic character of the helix. we refer to these isoforms from now on as par17-qr and -rs.

positively charged amphipatic n-terminal α-helices are typical mitochondrial targeting signals  <cit> . therefore, we predicted par17's cellular localization using the online prediction tools mitopred  <cit> , mitoprot  <cit> , predotar  <cit> , psortii  <cit>  and targetp  <cit> . the respective values for par <dig>  par17-qr and -rs are given in table  <dig>  the  <dig> amino acid elongation is recognized as a mitochondrial targeting peptide by mitoprot and predotar, but not by psortii. by contrast, mitopred classified par <dig>  par17-qr and -rs as mitochondrial. as it was not possible to reliably predict par <dig> localization by these prediction algorithms, it became necessary to investigate the intracellular localization of parvulin proteins experimentally.

the output of sub-cellular localization prediction programs regarding the localization to mitochondria is given with numbers between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

par <dig> is targeted to mitochondria within human cells
to determine the localization of the endogenous par <dig> protein, an antibody against the n-terminal extension  <cit>  was used for par <dig> detection in sub-cellular fractions. hela cells were separated into cytosolic, nuclear, membrane and mitochondrial fractions, followed by western blotting. par <dig> was detected as a  <dig> kda protein species within the mitochondrial and membrane fractions . purity of the mitochondrial fraction was demonstrated by blotting against cytochrome c. these data point to an association of endogenous par <dig> with mitochondria or mitochondrial membranes.

to discriminate between par <dig> and par <dig> localization, overexpression studies using egfp fusions were performed. egfp was c-terminally fused to par17-qr and -rs proteins and to par <dig> as negative control. hela cells grown on cover slips were transfected with the above-mentioned constructs and stained with mitotracker, a dye that accumulates in mitochondria with intact membrane potential. fluorescence microscopic images of these constructs in hela cells are shown in figure 3b; expression as full-length proteins was verified by western blot using an anti-gfp antibody . par17-rs- and -qr-egfp co-localized with mitochondrial staining. totals of  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ± 9% of egfp fluorescence were measured to overlap with the mitotracker signal for par17-rs and -qr, respectively. par14-egfp fluorescence is equally distributed throughout the cytosol and partially enriched in the nucleus, as has been described previously  <cit> . co-localization values were far lower for par14-egfp  and egfp alone .

therefore, the presequence seemed to be the determinant for mitochondrial targeting, and the question arose whether the par <dig> n-terminus was necessary and/or sufficient for mitochondrial targeting. to investigate this, egfp was fused either to the presequence or to presequence coupled to the basic domain of par <dig>  then, hela cells were transfected with these constructs. their egfp fluorescence overlapped with the mitotracker signal to a lesser extent than the full length par <dig> constructs with co-localization ratios of  <dig> ± 8% for presequence-rs-basic domain,  <dig> ± 11% for presequence-qr-basic domain,  <dig> ± 15% for presequence-rs and  <dig> ± 13% for presequence-qr. as can be deduced from these data, the mitochondrial association of par <dig> is dependent on the presequence, but the basic and ppiase domains enhance mitochondrial targeting. the transfected constructs and co-localization values are schematically depicted in figure 3d. taken together, the cell fractionation studies and the localization of parvulin egfp fusions provide independent evidence that par <dig> isoforms are targeted to mitochondria.

par <dig> import into isolated mitochondria
if the par <dig> presequence represents a classical mitochondrial targeting signal, par <dig> would be expected to be imported into mitochondria. however, a recent study reported cell type-specific mitochondrial association, but not import, of the related protein pin <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it was interesting to differentiate between association and import by invitro experiments with isolated mitochondria. as par17-qr- and -rs-egfp fusions co-localized with mitochondrial staining to the same extent within the range of error, the following in vitro experiments were performed with the qr isoform only. par <dig> and par <dig> were labeled by 35s-methionine incorporation and incubated with isolated yeast mitochondria. soluble protein was separated from mitochondria and the mitochondrial pellet was subsequently washed with increasing salt concentrations followed by autoradiography . as positive control, the yeast porin efficiently integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane and therefore exhibited a salt-independent association with mitochondria, whereas gfp  was not able to associate with mitochondria at any salt concentrations. par <dig> associated with mitochondria and could only be released to 50% upon washing with  <dig> mm nacl, indicating tight association and/or import . interestingly, par <dig> also associated at low salt concentrations with mitochondria, but was efficiently released from mitochondria at physiological or higher salt concentrations .

next, mitochondria isolated from human, rat and yeast cells were used for proteinase k  import studies, where all protein associated with mitochondria is re-isolated by centrifugation. any protein that is not protected by translocation into sub-mitochondrial compartments will subsequently be degraded by pk. although both par <dig> and par17-qr were degraded at  <dig> μg/ml pk , at least  <dig> μg/ml pk were used throughout the following import studies. par <dig> was re-isolated after incubation together with all types of mitochondria used , again pointing to an association of the protein with mitochondrial organelles. moreover, pk treatment showed that this labeled protein reached a protease-protected compartment, indicating import. par <dig> also associated with mitochondria, but was not imported as it was completely degraded by pk.

kinetic import experiments were then performed with different incubation times. figure 4c shows the par <dig> import into yeast and human mitochondria increased with time. as absolute import efficiencies cannot be compared between mitochondria from different sources, we used the fusion protein su9-dhfr as positive control. import into yeast mitochondria was significant, but rather low when compared to su9-dhfr. however, par17-qr and su9-dhfr showed similar import efficiencies upon incubation with human mitochondria from the same preparation.

to test for the dependence on the mitochondrial membrane potential, yeast mitochondria were incubated with valinomycin either before or after the import reaction to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane potential. if import depends on the membrane potential, mitochondria with the de-coupling agent added before import would not import par <dig> to the matrix. if this is not the case, par <dig> should be imported irrespective of when valinomycin was added. as seen in figure 4d, par <dig> is only imported into mitochondria with intact membrane potential . therefore, the import of par <dig> is dependent on an intact potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

to define the sub-mitochondrial localization of par <dig> more precisely, a final set of import experiments were performed with reference proteins from different mitochondrial compartments. par <dig> and the yeast porin, a component of the outer mitochondrial membrane were imported into rat mitochondria . in a parallel reaction mitochondria were subjected to hypo-osmotic swelling, resulting in rupture of the outer membrane and loss of the porin protein. par <dig>  however, remained protected from pk degradation – indicating that it is at the very least transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane. it can only be degraded by pk when the mitochondria are lysed completely by the addition of 1% digitonin. the inner membrane protein tim <dig> and the matrix protein mge <dig>  as controls for inner mitochondrial compartments, together with par <dig> were then monitored during stepwise lysis of mitochondria using digitonin. identical mitochondrial lysis reactions were performed for all three proteins with increasing amounts of digitonin, analyzed by autoradiography  or western blot . at a concentration of  <dig> % digitonin the inner membrane protein tim <dig> was already partially degraded, while par <dig> and the matrix protein mge <dig> resist pk degradation . tim <dig> is known to display one pk sensitive domain to the inter-membrane space,  <cit>  which served as an epitope for the antibody used here. all three proteins became susceptible to pk degradation when the mitochondria were lysed completely by  <dig> % digitonin.

therefore, combined data obtained from in vitro experiments with yeast, rat and human mitochondria demonstrate the import of par <dig> into mitochondria to be dependent on the presence of the novel n-terminal domain. in addition, par <dig> was imported in a time- and membrane potential-dependent manner to the mitochondrial matrix, but without concomitant processing of the protein.

par <dig> binds to double-stranded dna at physiological salt concentrations
par <dig> and par <dig> exhibit different n-terminal regions and markedly different sub-cellular localizations. therefore, the question arose whether par <dig> can be involved in similar cellular functions as the nuclear-enriched par <dig>  yet within a different sub-cellular compartment: the mitochondrion. the highly conserved protein par <dig> binds to at-rich double-stranded dna  within the nucleus  <cit> , displays certain similarities to hmg proteins  <cit>  and is assumed to be involved in transcriptional regulation. hence, we tested whether binding characteristics to dsdna were retained between the different parvulins. binding of par17-qr and par <dig> to dna cellulose was studied using radiolabeled lysates. bound protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of kcl. only at salt concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> mm kcl was par17-qr eluted from dna cellulose , with a residual par <dig> fraction even eluting at  <dig> mm kcl. par <dig> behaved in a similar manner. porin was used as negative control for dna cellulose binding and was already washed off with  <dig> and  <dig> mm kcl. a parallel dna binding assay was performed with par17-qr, -rs and par <dig> as egfp fusions expressed in hela cells. gels were quantified by densitometry, with good agreement with the assay using radiolabeled proteins. from figure 5b it can be derived that par17-qr, -rs and par <dig> all were comparably eluted from dsdna at  <dig>   <dig> and even  <dig> mm kcl, whereas egfp without fusion was completely eluted from the dna cellulose beads at  <dig> mm kcl. partial degradation of nucleic acids bound to the dna cellulose beads used in these experiments by benzonase diminished par <dig> binding . this shows that the hominid-specific mitochondrial matrix protein par <dig> can bind to double-stranded dna at physiological salt concentrations.

discussion
import of par <dig> into mitochondria
the recently described protein par <dig> differs from the highly conserved parvulin par <dig> only by a novel n-terminal domain. in this study, endogenous par <dig> was detected in membrane and mitochondrial fractions, and egfp fusions of par <dig> were targeted to mitochondria. the dye used in these experiments  is only accumulated by mitochondria with intact membrane potential. as no differing mitochondrial staining was detected for transfected cells as compared to untransfected ones, overexpression of par <dig> seemed not to be toxic for hela cell mitochondria. egfp fusions of the two par <dig> isoforms, par17-qr and -rs, were targeted to mitochondria with no significant differences in their co-localization values with mitotracker. therefore, only one isoform of par <dig>  was used for in vitro import experiments with isolated mitochondria; these experiments clearly showed human par <dig> to be imported into the matrix of human, rat and yeast mitochondria. in addition, association of par <dig> and par <dig> proteins with mitochondrial surfaces was shown irrespective of the origin of the organelles. consequently, most of the subsequent studies were performed with yeast mitochondria due to their experimental advantages  <cit> , showing the import of par <dig> to be dependent on intact mitochondrial membrane potential and to increase with time. finally, sub-mitochondrial localization experiments showed that par <dig> reached the mitochondrial matrix. rulten et al  <cit>  have already detected par <dig> within the mitochondrial matrix using an antibody against the ppiase domain. however, as this domain is shared between the two proteins par <dig> and par <dig>  the signal is likely to have originated from par <dig> and not par <dig> 

one puzzling observation was that in vitro imported as well as endogenous par <dig> within mitochondrial fractions was not processed after mitochondrial import, which would be expected for a classical targeting peptide. however, non-cleavable presequences have been described for the hsp <dig> chaperonin  <dig>  <cit> , rhodanese  <cit> , 3-oxoacyl-coa thiolase  <cit>  and the beta-subunit of the human electron-transfer flavoprotein  <cit> . whether the negative charge of glu <dig> within the amphipatic helix prevents this presequence being recognized by the matrix processing peptidase in analogy of yeast leu <dig>  <cit>  – another un-processed matrix protein with a glutamate at position  <dig> – remains to be tested. even as a non-cleavable presequence, the n-terminal domain was shown to be necessary for import, but the basic and ppiase domains increase mitochondrial targeting.

mitochondrial proteomic studies
as a mitochondrial protein, par <dig> should have previously been detected in one of the recently performed proteomic studies on the constituents of the mitochondrial proteome. although the yeast mitochondrial proteome has been explored experimentally to about 80% coverage using a variety of mass spectroscopy and tagging techniques  <cit> , neither par <dig> nor par <dig> are encoded by the yeast genome. recent proteomic analysis of the yeast mitochondrial proteome  identified two novel ppiases   <cit>  with no sequence similarities to the parvulins described in this study. mitochondrial proteomes of mammalian species are assumed to be considerably more complex  <cit> , and their proportionate coverage by proteomic methods is correspondingly low  <cit> . the fraction of mitochondrial proteomes resisting identification by large-scale approaches tends to contain proteins that are expressed in low concentrations or only under certain conditions  <cit>  as well as hydrophobic, small and/or highly basic proteins  <cit>  with isoelectric points  above  <dig>  with an mrna level about 50- to 100-fold lower than that of par <dig>  <cit>  and a pi of  <dig> , par <dig> hence represents a mitochondrial, low abundance, basic protein having escaped detection within mitochondria, even in a recent proteomic study on the human mitochondrial dna nucleoid  <cit> . peptides contained in either par <dig> or par <dig> have not been listed in any of the studies mentioned above.

evolution of the par <dig> prepeptide within anthropoid primates
the proteome of mitochondria has changed dramatically during eukaryotic evolution, with proteins continuously recruited to the mitochondria expanding the proteome of this organelle and providing it with new functions or adaptations  <cit> . mitochondrial recruitment can occur by exon duplication and exon shuffling, thereby exchanging existing targeting signals between different nuclear genes  <cit>  as has been described, for example, for the rps <dig> gene from oryza sativa  <cit>  or the plant cytochrome c <dig> precursor  <cit> .

the contrary seems to be the case with par <dig>  the evolution of par17's presequence follows the evolution of primates as can be derived from the dna sequences obtained in this study. whereas the coding sequence for par <dig> is highly conserved within all primates, the presequence of par <dig> evolved steadily from new world monkeys to great apes. there is no spontaneous occurrence of a functional presequence as a result of an exchange with other nuclear encoded genes as this sequence motif is not found anywhere else in the human or macaque genomes. taken the estimated time scales for primate evolution from glazko and nei  <cit>  and goodman et al  <cit> , the insertion leading to the 5' atg codons to be in-frame with the par <dig> coding sequence was acquired not until the separation of old world monkeys and apes about  <dig> ±  <dig> million years ago. gibbons are known to have separated from great apes about  <dig> million years ago. the introduction of an interrupting taa stop codon between the par <dig> atg and the par <dig> atg must have occurred after this branching point, but a more exact time point cannot be concluded from these data. thus, phylogenetic comparison of genomic sequence data from  <dig> different primate species confines the par <dig> protein to hominids, only. the presequence therefore represents the most recently evolved functional mitochondrial targeting peptide known to date as it was not acquired until the divergence of apes and old world monkeys.

another issue that can be addressed in light of the different genomic par <dig> sequences is the occurrence of the different human par <dig> isoforms qr and rs. from the alignment in figure 1a it can be derived that the isoform with gln <dig> and arg <dig> is the ancestral one. why humans have acquired these coding snp and if they serve any function remains to be elucidated in the future.

could the 5' utr of parvulin mrnas have had a function for par <dig> expression before it became a coding sequence? the partially conserved upstream atg codons and short upstream open reading frames might have been involved in translational  regulation of par <dig> expression as has been described for other proteins  <cit> . in addition, differing mrna secondary structures of the parvulin 5' utr for several primates were predicted using the mfold prediction server  <cit> . within the non-hominid primate mrnas, the sequence downstream of the first aug codon is involved in an extended mrna stem loop. this putative secondary structure is disturbed by the insertion leading to the sequence found in apes. therefore, we speculate that mrna secondary structure and/or translational regulation of par <dig> was the evolutionary driving force for this part of the parvulin mrna before it gained a protein coding function in great apes.

the evolutionary transition from apes to great apes involved significant remodeling of protein constituents of mitochondria: cytochrome c oxidase subunits  <cit>  as constituents of the electron transport chain  <cit>  as well as atp synthetase subunits  <cit>  have undergone accelerated changes during primate evolution. par <dig> within the mitochondrial matrix now represents a novel protein constituent added to the hominid-specific mitochondrial proteome.

par <dig> as mitochondrial dna-binding protein
from the three ppiase families known, cyclophilind and fkbp- <dig> have already been shown to be recruited to mitochondria where they play a role at the permeability transition pore and in apoptosis, respectively  <cit> . however, none of these ppiases is known to bind to double-stranded dna . the present study however shows that par <dig> is able to bind to dsdna at physiological salt concentrations in a similar way to par <dig>  assuming that sequence specificity is not altered between par <dig> and par <dig>  the  <dig> base pairs comprising human mitochondrial genome  was searched for the following motifs that have been identified as tightest binders by surmacz et al  <cit> : dsdna octamers taaaaaat, atgaaaat and ataaaaat. as octamers, each of these motifs should statistically occur once in  <dig>  kb of random sequence. as seven such motifs can be found within the human mitochondrial refseq dna sequence, putative par <dig> binding sites seem to be enriched within the mitochondrial genome. a function for par <dig> in the context of mitochondrial dna also seems likely due to its similarities to hmg proteins  <cit>  as mitochondrial hmg proteins have been described very recently  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the dna binding parvulin protein par <dig> is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by the most recently evolved mitochondrial prepeptide known to-date only occurring in great apes species and man. brain enlargement in primates has been paralleled by a significant remodeling of the mitochondrial proteome. hence, a novel protein constituent of the hominidae specific mitochondrial protein repertoire might have implications on the molecular understanding of brain diseases and the evolution of man.
