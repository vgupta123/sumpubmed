BACKGROUND
molecular analysis during the early period of embryonic development has long been prevented in mammals because of the scarcity of biological material, whatever the species considered. in recent years, however, technical improvements in the analysis of messenger rnas from tiny amounts of cells have revealed the complexity of the genome expressed during the preimplantation period  <cit> . this complexity has been highlighted in recent publications which reported the isolation of new sequences in different mammalian species  <cit> . although the transient and tissue-specific expression of such sequences during later development cannot formally be ruled out, they are more likely to be specifically expressed during the preimplantation stages, which has thus prevented their identification until now  <cit> . this underlines the need for dedicated transcriptomic tools to investigate these developmental stages. such tools now exist for studies in mice  <cit> , but still have to be developed for other species. of the different strategies available to establish cdna libraries, suppression subtractive hybridisation   <cit>  is an efficient and widely-used pcr-based method to obtain subtracted libraries and isolate differentially expressed genes. the procedure involves two successive tester-driver hybridisation steps, the first of which induces a normalisation of tester-specific molecules, thus allowing the subsequent cloning of rare, tester-specific transcripts. because ssh can be initiated using pcr-amplified cdnas, it seems particularly well-suited to mammal preimplantation stage embryos which contain only a few tens of picograms of mrnas. furthermore, because ssh does not require previous knowledge of gene sequences, it may also be suitable for species where only a small number of sequences are available in databases.

although it has already been used to get insight into early embryo transcriptome  <cit> , ssh performance in this area has not been widely documented. this is because authors usually establish only one dedicated library and provide information restricted to a few biologically relevant clones isolated from this library. because we were interested in the more systematic establishment of ssh libraries dedicated to the analysis of early mammalian embryo development, we designed a procedure involving exogenous reporter transcripts that mimic either tester-specific or tester-driver common transcripts to enable the large scale assessment of the quality of such libraries. this procedure was applied to four independent libraries and provided information on their quality and the repeatability of the ssh procedure applied to early-stage embryos. these data were further validated by the sequencing and clustering of about  <dig> clones isolated from one of these libraries. our results show that when applied to preimplantation mammal embryos, the cdnas of which had been pre-amplified using the smart  procedure, ssh-generated libraries repeatedly provided access to very scarce, tester-specific transcripts, despite irregular normalisation and some subtraction failures.

RESULTS
three of the libraries we established aimed to analyse embryonic genome transcriptional activation in rabbit and cattle , while the fourth library  was designed for studies on early cell differentiation at the blastocyst stage in the rabbit.

in order to achieve a broad appraisal of the quality of the libraries, we decided to array several thousand clones from each library and analyse the abundance of tester-specific and tester/driver common transcripts in the subtracted libraries after bacteria transformation. however, neither strict tester-specific transcripts nor tester/driver common and equally expressed transcripts are identified at these stages in bovine and rabbit embryos, so we introduced exogenous a. thaliana transcripts into our biological material prior to pre-amplification and subtraction . we screened  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clones from the rab <dig>  bov <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> libraries, respectively, for the presence of rare, tester-specific transcripts, using hybridisation with probes corresponding to the exogenous transcripts added. whatever the lowest abundance of the reporter rna , we found clones which encoded for the scarce, tester-specific transcript in the libraries. these clones represented more than  <dig> % of the colonies . this result was in agreement with the initial findings of diatchenko's group  <cit> , but disagreed with the results published more recently by ji et al.  <cit>  that suggest that only abundant targets  underwent efficient enrichment by ssh pcr, thus precluding the detection of transcription factors and receptors. such divergent conclusions may have been due to differences in analytical sensitivity, because ji et al. only considered subtracted cdna smears after agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> , whereas we applied the hybridisation of specific, radiolabelled probes to thousands of bacterial colonies. we also found that exogenous reporter rnas were differentially represented among the bacterial colonies, in line with their initial abundance in the tester material . while clones encoding rare and moderately abundant tester-specific transcripts represented  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the clones in the libraries, abundant tester-specific transcripts were very frequently represented in the subtracted libraries . these results thus show that rare and moderately abundant transcripts are roughly normalised by the ssh procedure while abundant transcripts are not. this is inconsistent with the conclusions reached by both diatchenko et al  <cit>  and ji et al  <cit> , suggesting that all or nothing differentially expressed cdnas were enriched to a similar final level, irrespective of their initial concentration. here again, these divergent conclusions could be explained by differences in the experimental procedures: during our study, reporter transcripts were added to a complex biological material containing both commonly and differentially expressed transcripts, whereas tester-specific reporter dna were added to a common cdna used as tester and driver material by diatchenko  <cit>  and ji  <cit> . the hybridisation kinetics during our study were probably more representative of most biological situations. moreover, two other experimental approaches allowed us to conclude that the unequalized abundance of exogenous transcripts in our libraries was representative of the behaviour of endogenous transcripts.

#: not introduced in library

-: no clone detected among the screened clones

first of all, we picked seven clones at random from the rab <dig> library that did not encode for exogenous transcripts, and analysed their abundance in the library by hybridising each radiolabelled insert to  <dig> clones from the library. three of them were present only once, the others  were found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively. the most abundant of these clones  thus represented  <dig> % of the clones in the rab <dig> library. its sequence corresponded to a fragment of rabbit mitochondrial 16s rrna .

secondly, we systematically sequenced  <dig> clones from the rab <dig> library that did not hybridise to the 3c <dig> insert. from these clones,  <dig> "good quality" sequences were assembled into  <dig> distinct contigs, of which  <dig> were singlet contigs. the depth of the  <dig> remaining contigs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . only  <dig> contigs contained more than  <dig> sequences, two of them corresponding to a. thaliana tester-specific exogenous transcripts . these  <dig> contigs totalized  <dig> sequences. surprisingly, the deepest contig – that containing  <dig>  of the sequenced clones – encoded for the complete mitochondrial 16s rrna, with a high prevalence of sequences bordering the 3c <dig> fragment. finally, about 22% of the rab <dig> library clones encoded for this mitochondrial cdna.

sequence data validated the results obtained by hybridisation for tester-specific exogenous transcripts. we found 86/ <dig>  clones encoding for the abundant reporter tester-specific transcript, 14/ <dig>  clones encoding for the moderately abundant one and 6/ <dig>  for the rare one, these results being in agreement with hybridisation results . sequencing also confirmed the results obtained for common transcripts in the rab <dig> library, since no sequenced clone corresponded to these exogenous transcripts . however, "commonly expressed transcript" elimination seemed somewhat variable in the four libraries we analysed . in the worst case , with respect to transcripts of the same initial abundance, we observed five-fold less representation in the library for the tester/driver commonly expressed transcript when compared with the tester-specific transcript .

the normalisation failures observed for abundant exogenous reporter-transcripts probably reflected the results concerning endogenous transcripts: the coexistence of a majority of singlet contigs  with a few, very deep contigs.

in order to obtain more information about highly redundant endogenous sequences in the libraries, we returned to the 3l <dig>  3p <dig>  3i <dig> and 3c <dig> transcripts. their high level of representation in the library suggested that they encode for abundant transcripts, but the mitochondrial nature of 3c <dig> rendered tester-specific expression highly unlikely. we thus analysed the relative abundance of these four cdnas in tester and driver unsubtracted materials. semi-quantitative analysis  revealed that these four clones encode for very abundant cdna in the tester material : they represented about  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %  of blastocyst cdnas. they thus constituted a fourth category of transcripts that we did not mimic with the exogenous a. thaliana transcripts. two of them  were tester-specific, but the others  were expressed in both tester and driver, with double their relative abundance in tester than in driver . it thus appears that very abundant tester-specific transcripts escape normalisation, whereas very abundant transcripts expressed in both tester and driver escape both subtraction and normalisation.

under these conditions, the few deep contigs we obtained by sequencing the library could correspond to either abundant or very abundant tester-specific transcripts escaping normalisation, or to very abundant commonly expressed transcripts escaping both subtraction and normalisation. these normalisation  failures resulted in a significant proportion of highly redundant sequences  in the library.

in view of the considerable concordance between sequencing and hybridisation data, we assumed that the addition of exogenous reporter transcripts and analysis of their representation in the library would ensure reliable monitoring of ssh performance. however, the very high representation of mitochondrial 16s rrna in the library showed that the frequency we chose to mimic abundant transcripts underestimated the representation of certain transcripts in our biological material.  <dig> srrna was found to represent a high proportion  of unsubtracted cdnas, which could be correlated to the very rapid growth  <cit>  and marked metabolic activity of the blastocyst in the rabbit species, which certainly requires strong mitochondrial activity during the early stages of development. mitochondrial transcripts have been shown to represent as much as 23% of polyadenylated rnas in mouse blastocysts  <cit> . such quantitative data are not available in the rabbit.

our results show that application of the ssh procedure to early development permits the isolation of scarce tester-specific transcripts despite irregular normalisation and some subtraction failures concerning very abundant transcripts.

taken together, these data confirmed and extended previous reports showing that whatever the origin of the clones picked from ssh constructed libraries – random choice or selection by differential screening – some of them are heavily represented among the sequenced clones . since this unequalized representation has been reported in both smart-preamplified-cdna subtracted libraries  <cit>  and non preamplified cdna libraries  <cit> , it should not be considered as a consequence of the cdna preamplification step but rather as an intrinsic defect in the ssh procedure.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that ssh libraries dedicated to early mammalian development are greatly enriched in tester-specific transcripts. they are only partially normalized, with transcript equalization being restricted to rare and moderately abundant transcripts. very abundant transcripts common to both tester and driver may escape both normalisation and subtraction, giving rise to abundant background clones in these libraries. the differential expression of genes represented by redundant clones in subtracted libraries should therefore be checked very carefully.

these conditions were however compatible with the isolation of very rare tester-specific transcripts  in the libraries. under these conditions, ssh produced reproducible results in terms of rare stage-specific transcript isolation and can thus be considered as a tool of considerable potential when studying the onset of mammalian development.
