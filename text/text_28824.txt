BACKGROUND
apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a normal physiological function essential for the homeostasis of immuno haemopoietic tissues. this process occurs via specific signaling pathways, eventually leading to dna fragmentation, nuclear condensation, proteolysis and cell fragmentation  <cit> . an important regulatory event in the apoptotic process is the activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, which regulate two major and relatively distinct pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. the extrinsic pathway known also as mitochondrial pathway involves pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family of proteins  <cit> .

the initiation of apoptosis is dependent on a variety of signals, many of which can be modulated by strenuous exercise  <cit> . consequently, it has been suggested that apoptosis contributes to the loss of blood lymphocytes after exercise possibly via the cell surface death receptor cd <dig>  signaling  <cit> , resulting in post-exercise lymphocytopenia, which could lead to lowered immunity in athletes performing frequent and physically demanding training regimens. studies that have examined the effects of exercise on the extent of apoptosis in blood lymphocyte in humans are few, thus making it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions  <cit> .

exercise increases oxygen consumption and causes a disturbance of intracellular pro-oxidant-antioxidant homeostasis  <cit> . the mitochondrial electron transport chain  <cit> , and xanthine oxidase  <cit>  have been identified as major sources of intracellular reactive oxygen species  and free radical generation during exercise  <cit> . two recent studies have proven that ros accumulation readily modifies the activity of a new class of proteins called sirtuins  <cit> .

in humans the sirtuins family of proteins is composed of seven members  that share the catalytic domain with sir <dig>  <cit> . in particular, sirt <dig> can modulate cellular stress response and survival through regulation of p <dig>  <cit> , nf-kb signaling  <cit>  and foxo transcription factors  <cit> . several studies showed that sirt <dig> is a key regulator of cellular metabolism  <cit>  and survival in response to external stressors  <cit> . furthermore, since skeletal muscle increased levels of oxidative damage with aging  <cit> , regular exercise is very useful in increase its antioxidant potential that can be modulated by the activity of sirt <dig>  <cit> . recent studies have reported that others sirtuins, such as sirt <dig>  sirt <dig> and sirt <dig>  are located in the mitochondria  <cit> . in particular, it has been demonstrated that the mitochondrial nad-dependent deacetylase sirt <dig> plays a role in the maintenance of basal atp levels and as regulator of mitochondrial electron transport  <cit> . in fact, sirt <dig> decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production, while increasing cellular respiration  <cit> .

the present investigation has been designed to test the effect of an endurance effort, typical in runners participating in standard  marathon events, on apoptotic cell status in a controlled laboratory setting. furthermore, we have studied the effect of the same endurance effort on sirtuin proteins in order to understand their role in this kind of exercise.

RESULTS
marathon race
all subjects successfully completed a marathon . total training impulse  score accumulated over the marathon race averaged  <dig> Â±  <dig> arbitrary unit, equivalent to exercise at 80% of heart rate reserve for  <dig> to ~ <dig> min.

exercise and bcl- <dig> pathway apoptotic signaling
we determined the effects of exercise on bcl- <dig> family upstream of caspase- <dig>  including caspase- <dig> and bax: bcl- <dig> ratio. figure  <dig> shows the same procaspase- <dig> rna levels in the group before and after marathon . rna expression of proapoptotic bax in the group showed a significant decrease after marathon . by contrast, the antiapoptotic bcl- <dig> rna levels increased in the group after marathon  . thus, we calculated bax: bcl- <dig> ratio in the same group before and after marathon and such ratio was attenuated after marathon .

dna laddering
representative dna fragmentation is shown in figure  <dig>  a laddering pattern was observed in dna isolated from samples in which the ratio bax: bcl- <dig> after marathon was slightly higher than the others. by contrast, we did not observe any apparent laddering pattern in the dna isolated from those samples in which the ratio bax: bcl- <dig> was lower than the others.

hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  cu-zn-sod, and mn-sod, i-nos levels
northern blot analysis demonstrated that the rna content of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> increased substantially in the studied group after marathon . similarly, the rna content of cu-zn-sod, mn-sod and i-nos increased after marathon . we have found that the change in hsp <dig> rna expression is positively correlated to the change of both mn-sod  and bcl- <dig> transcripts  after marathon . in addition, we have also found that the change in hsp <dig> rna expression is positively correlated to the change of bcl- <dig> transcripts  .

sirt <dig>  sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> levels
northern blot analysis demonstrated that the rna contents of sirt <dig> increased substantially in the group after marathon . on the other hand, the rna contents of sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> decreased in the group after marathon . furthermore, we also found a significant positive correlation between a change in sirt <dig> rna levels and trimp  after marathon . a trend of correlation was detected between the trimp and change in sirt <dig> rna levels after marathon .

in addition, northern blot analysis showed that rna levels of the sirt1-dependent transcription factor foxo3a and its target gadd <dig> were increased in the studied group after marathon . in addition, we found also a significant positive correlation between a change in gadd <dig> rna levels and trimp  after marathon .

discussion
the present study provides evidence that strenuous physical load attenuates the extent of apoptosis in amateur runners. in particular, we found that both hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> rna expression is positively correlated to bcl- <dig> transcript content after marathon . we can suppose that hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> may play an anti-apoptotic role in modulating the homeostasis of apoptotic factors in amateur runners after exercise. a critical step in the execution of the apoptotic program is cleavage of caspases  <cit> . the rna levels of procaspase- <dig> were not changed in the amateur runners before and after marathon. combined with dna fragmentation data, this is the first direct evidence that strenuous physical load endured during marathon provides a physiological protection against the proapoptotic process.

it has also been suggested that ros production influences apoptosis mainly through the modulation of the mitochondrial mediated pathway  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that a high oxidative stress level destabilizes the mitochondrial membrane homeostasis and therefore induces the formation of mitochondrial membrane permeability pores releasing pro-apoptotic factors . bcl- <dig> family proteins are known to be responsible for the modulation of mitochondrial membrane pore formation and therefore regulating mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. we have shown that rna levels of proapoptotic bax were consistently decreased after marathon, whereas, rna levels of antiapoptotic bcl- <dig> were slightly increased after marathon thereby causing a decreased bax: bcl- <dig> ratio . our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that alterations in bax: bcl- <dig> ratio with exercise regulate downstream caspase-driven apoptosis during the exercise. furthermore, ferrer and colleagues   <cit>  reported a decreased expression of bcl- <dig> after intense exercise versus the expression obtained previous exercise. the differences with our data could be attributed to differences between both experiments as the type of exercise, duration of the tests, time after exercise of sampling, differences between the moment in which the sampling was made before exercise. we have examined the possibility that the age range and the differences in vo <dig> max of our subjects could influence the apoptotic parameters considered. however, we did not find any significant correlation between differences in age or vo <dig> max and all the molecular parameters measured .

several antioxidant enzymes, including cu-zn-sod, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and mitochondrial mn-sod have been implicated as crucial endogenous antioxidant enzymes in biological systems. in the present study, we have demonstrated that the rna content of mn-sod increases after marathon . these observations suggest that the answer of the cell may attenuate apoptosis. our data are consistent with the idea that an increased antioxidant capacity and modulated oxidative stress from strenuous physical load may be involved in reducing pro-apoptotic genes.

hsps are a group of highly conserved proteins induced by a variety of stresses, including hyperthermia, ph disturbance, and oxidative stress. there is evidence supporting the hypothesis that hsp <dig> inhibits apoptosis by modulating the mitochondrial-mediated pathway  <cit> . li and colleagues   <cit>  reported that hsp <dig> inhibits apoptosis by suppressing the formation of apoptosomes due to an effect downstream of cytochrome c release and upstream of caspase- <dig> activation. beere and colleagues   <cit>  have shown that hsp <dig> inhibits apoptosis by preventing the recruitment of procaspase- <dig> to the apoptosome. furthermore, fehrenbach et al.   <cit>  have shown that the protective functions of hsps include antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects and may prevent damage to dna. here, we have found a significant relationship between hsp <dig> and bcl- <dig> rna  levels following marathon, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this exercise induced adaptations in apoptosis and hsp <dig> are unknown and require further investigation.

furthermore, in the present study we demonstrate, for the first time, that sirt <dig> mrna expression increases after marathon . it is therefore very likely that increased sirt <dig> expression by endurance exercise results in elevated sirt <dig> deacetylase activity as well as causing an allosteric effect of an increased cytosolic nad+-to-nadh ratio.

in addition, an increase in sirt <dig> mrna levels could exert an antioxidant effect. brunet et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that in mammalian cells sirt <dig> appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating foxo transcription factors that function as sensors of the insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of longevity. in particular, these authors showed that sirt <dig> and foxo3a form a complex in response to oxidative stress stimulus  <cit> . mammalian foxo factors control several biological functions, such as cell cycle arrest, detoxification of ros  <cit>  and repair of damaged dna  <cit> . sirt <dig> increased foxo3a ability to induce cell cycle arrest and enhanced expression of a foxo3a target involved in dna repair, such as gadd <dig>  <cit> . because it is known that exercise training exerts its beneficial effects particularly on the cardiovascular system, we tested foxo3a and its targets involvement in group, showing that exercise training enhanced foxo3a rna levels. this was associated with an increase in gadd <dig> mrnas after marathon. this finding could be related to higher oxidative stress in samples that would induce to choose apoptosis or necrosis rather than repair as mechanism of detoxification.

furthermore, we found that sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> rna levels decreased after marathon and also that there was a positive correlation between sirt <dig> rna levels and training load   <cit> . a trend of correlation was also detected between the trimp and change in sirt <dig> rna levels after marathon, however this trend was not statistically significant . these two sirtuin proteins are known to localize in the mitochondria; although sirt <dig> was reported to change its localization from mitochondrial to nuclear when coexpressed with sirt <dig>  <cit> . the recent identification of the first substrates for mitochondrial sirtuins--acetyl coenzyme a synthetase  <dig>  <cit> , and glutamate dehydrogenase   <cit> --as targets of sirtuins  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, revealed that these sirtuins control a regulatory network that has implications for energy metabolism and the mechanisms of caloric restriction  and lifespan determination  <cit> . in particular, sirt <dig> has a role for the mitochondrial nad-dependent deacetylase, for the maintenance of basal atp levels and as a regulator of mitochondrial electron transport  <cit> . considering our preliminary results and the fact that little is known about the role of sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> in human physiology, the differences in sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> mrna expression before and after marathon that we observed may be due to the redox changes in the mitochondria during the marathon stress. thus, our results support the hypothesis that exercise may interfere with expression of this family of proteins at mitochondrial level. further studies are under way to study this aspect.

CONCLUSIONS
our data presented in this study show that: 1) the balance between pro and anti-apoptotic genes is shifted to a anti apoptotic state after strenuous exercise 2) strenuous exercise may interfere with expression of sirt <dig> and sirt <dig>  which may be a key regulator of exercise training. additional studies are under way in order to elucidate the role of the sirts family and bcl- <dig> family during different exercise protocols.
