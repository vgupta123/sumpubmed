BACKGROUND
vascular calcification in the tunica media of arteries and blood vessels is often observed in the elderly population, in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease  <cit> . vascular calcifications represent a major clinical problem being in the origin of cardiovascular disease and ultimately mortality  <cit> . vascular smooth muscle cells  are contractile cells located at the medial layer of the vessel wall. vsmcs can be triggered to transdifferentiate into calcified vascular cells , loosing the phenotypic markers responsible for smooth muscle cell contractility  <cit> . further physiological alterations of vsmc include entering a synthetic state with abundant production of extracellular matrix  proteins  <cit>  followed by matrix vesicle-mediated calcification  <cit> .

it has been hypothesized that pathological medial calcification is a process analogue to bone mineralization with vsmcs entering an osteoblast-like differentiation program  <cit> . atherosclerotic plaques, of medial and valvular origin, express several bone-related ecm proteins, including osteopontin, collagen i, matrix gla protein , osteonectin and osteocalcin . in addition, calcified vascular tissue expresses bone specific transcription factors and bone morphogenetic proteins  . despite these similarities with osteoblast differentiation the exact mechanism behind vsmcs transdifferentiation into c-vsmcs remains largely unknown. some studies have suggested that only a subset of the vsmc pool has osteogenic potential  <cit> . pathological vascular calcifications may arise due to loss of mineralization inhibitors, which are continuously expressed in healthy vascular tissue  <cit> . mice lacking mgp show spontaneous vascular calcifications  <cit> , a phenotype that is exacerbated when spp <dig>  another mineralization inhibitor, is deleted  <cit> . murshed and colleagues  <cit>  have explored this hypothesis further showing that mineralization can occur in any collagen type i rich tissue that expresses pyrophosphatases such as alkaline phosphatase . while collagen type i is ubiquitously expressed in the tissues, the co-expression of this ecm protein with alp is restricted to those that mineralize. alp is involved in the cleavage of pyrophosphate a potent mineralization inhibitor  <cit> . this enzyme on its own was shown to be able of inducing calcification in rat models of medial calcification  <cit> . normally vsmcs do not express alp but for unclear reasons they can transdifferentiate into c-vsmcs that show increased alp activity  <cit> .

in this study we aimed to reveal the processes whereby vsmcs develop into c-vsmcs exhibiting a calcified phenotype. we compared this pathological process to the physiological mechanism regarded as an analogue process, the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts.

under consideration were three hypotheses, 1) c-vsmcs are osteoblast or osteoblast-like cells transdifferentiating from the vsmc pool, 2) c-vsmcs initiate mineralization using osteoblast-like mechanisms, and 3) c-vsmcs mineralize using mechanisms unrelated to osteoblasts. to address these hypotheses we used genome-wide gene expression analysis during in vitro human vsmc development into c-vsmcs and human mesenchymal stem cell  differentiation into osteoblasts. we investigated these processes in terms of their known specific markers but also in an unbiased general perspective, using bioinformatics tools. global expression profiles and gene regulation were used to pinpoint the transcriptional program and the identity of a c-vsmc in comparison to the phenotype-resembling osteoblast.

RESULTS
the complete vsmc population develops into an alp positive population under osteogenic stimuli
vsmcs and mscs were cultured in osteogenic medium for 25 days to induce development into c-vsmcs and osteoblast respectively. during this period total alp activity was measured. as shown in figure 1a, alp activity increased in c-vsmcs and osteoblasts cultures compared to their precursor cells with enzymatic activity reaching higher absolute levels in osteoblasts than in their c-vsmc counterparts.

in addition, we measured alp expression at the individual cell level by flow cytometry. this data  corroborated the alp activity measurements. furthermore it demonstrates that msc and vsmc  differentiation is characterized by an expansion of the alp + cell pool .figure  <dig>

c-vsmcs and osteoblasts have distinct global gene expression profiles
next, we performed comparative genome-wide mrna expression analysis in osteogenic vsmc and msc cultures to characterize their transcriptional similarities and dissimilarities. five time-points  were analyzed during vsmc development to c-vsmcs and msc to osteoblasts. the data were normalized and probes/genes expressed in neither vsmc/c-vsmc nor msc/osteoblasts were excluded from further analysis. the overlap of expressed probes between osteogenic vsmc and msc cultures contained  <dig> probes representing  <dig> unique genes. these probes/genes were subsequently used for principle component analysis . pca allowed simultaneous comparison of multiple time-points in both cell types summarizing the relationship between them. the closer the data points appear in the pca plot , the more similar their gene expression profiles are. the pca plot showed that vsmcs and mscs at the start of culture  represented two clearly distinct clusters that upon osteogenic stimulation did not converge into an indistinguishable cluster of similarity . in other words, c-vsmcs and osteoblasts are two distinct cell types in terms of global gene expression.

several clusters could be identified during c-vsmc and osteoblast development. for both cell types, day  <dig> represented an intermediate stage after the osteogenic stimuli given to vsmcs and mscs . this transient stage is followed by a more stable period, day 8- <dig>  in which gene expression did not change so dramatically .figure  <dig>

vsmc calcifications are not dependent on the down-regulation of smooth muscle cell contractile markers
in the subsequent analysis we investigated the expression of  smooth muscle cell marker genes. we selected established vsmc markers described in literature  <cit> , including alpha-actin- <dig> , smooth-muscle myosin , calponin , smooth muscle protein 22-alpha , telokin , smoothelin , caldesmon , vinculin  and adipocyte enhancer-binding protein  <dig>  . we verified that expression of many of these genes was increased in c-vsmcs compared to their vsmc precursors during osteogenic conditions. this result was confirmed by qpcr but it could not be replicated in c-vsmcs from a second independent donor . this data demonstrate that c-vsmc are able to transdifferentiate without losing the contractile phenotype markers of vsmc. in addition it raises the idea c-vsmc do not necessarily acquire a full osteoblast-like transcriptome, something also found to be true for other models of vascular calcification  <cit> .figure  <dig>

genes identically regulated by c-vsmcs and osteoblasts are functionally annotated to extracellular region
to identify whether only specific groups of genes were identically regulated by c-vsmcs and osteoblasts, we have selected differentially expressed genes during vsmc development into c-vsmcs and during msc differentiation into osteoblasts. differential expression was calculated for each cell type relative to day  <dig>  when osteogenic treatment was initiated. probes/genes were considered differentially expressed when on at least one day during culture their log <dig> fold-change compared to day  <dig> was significantly  higher than  <dig>   or lower than - <dig>  . during c-vsmc development and osteoblast differentiation  <dig> probes and  <dig> probes met this criterion, respectively. considering the two cell types combined,  <dig> probes were found to be differentially expressed . of these  <dig> probes,  <dig> and  <dig> were exclusively differentially expressed in c-vsmcs or in osteoblasts, respectively. regarding the direction of gene expression regulation,  <dig> probes were identically regulated while  <dig> were oppositely changed during c-vsmc and osteoblast development .

the temporal and directional expression dynamics of the  <dig> differential expressed probes during c-vsmc development and osteoblast differentiation is resumed in figure  <dig>  k-means clustering separated the differentially expressed probes during c-vsmc development and osteoblast differentiation into clusters sharing common regulation patterns. on basis of figure of merit  analysis we concluded to divide gene expression data in  <dig> clusters . this number of clusters was found to provide good predictive power for the k-means algorithm  without restricting the cluster size for functional annotation analysis. functional gene ontology  annotation of genes underlying these clusters revealed information about the biological processes, cellular compartments and molecular functions during c-vsmc development and osteoblast differentiation .

clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained up-regulated genes while clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> represented down-regulated genes in both c-vsmcs and osteoblasts . in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> c-vsmcs and osteoblast shared the over-representation of genes linked to extracellular region . in clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> several go-terms were also shared by c-vsmcs and osteoblasts but these were more general go-terms like cell cycle, rna processing, chromosome, biological response to organic substance, etc., related to general cell function/metabolism. an exemption was cluster  <dig> that only showed significant enriched go terms for c-vsmcs. this fact may be attributed to statistical issues related to the lower number of genes fitting this cluster in osteoblasts. overall, cluster analyses did not clearly identify sets of bone-related processes or cellular components shared by c-vsmcs and osteoblast. nevertheless, it was interesting to observe that a common set of extracellular region genes from cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  was similarly regulated by both cell types indicating a shared mechanism involving changes in the extracellular environment/matrix.figure  <dig>

c-vsmcs express a subset of extracellular matrix genes and genes involved in biomineralization
considering the relevance of the extracellular environment for osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, we analysed in greater detail the expression of genes linked to extracellular region present in cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> and  <dig> contained in total  <dig> extracellular region genes  overlapping in c-vsmc and osteoblasts . expression pattern analyses of the cell type-specific genes from cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  showed clearly distinct expression patterns for c-vsmcs  and osteoblasts .figure  <dig>

the observation that among the  <dig> extracellular region genes overlapping in c-vsmcs and osteoblasts was a large subpopulation of ecm genes prompt us to identify differentially expressed ecm genes  identically modulated in both cell types. from the  <dig>  differentially expressed ecm genes in total  <dig>  were identically modulated in c-vsmcs and osteoblasts . the expression pattern of these  <dig> genes is shown in figure 5d. some of them are known to be involved in mineralization process of both the bone and the vasculature. this is the case for postn  and adamts <dig> , two genes showing consistent regulation across distinct primary cell donors .

in an alternative approach to compare osteoblasts and c-vsmc we performed gene correlation analyses based on a priori selected go-terms that are relevant for bone formation and mineralization. these go-terms included among others biomineral tissue development, osteoblast differentiation and regulation of bmp signaling genes . to assess specificity, correlation analyses were also performed for a randomly selected set of expressed genes. genes involved in biomineral tissue development  showed the highest correlation between c-vsmcs and osteoblasts  with an r <dig> much higher than for a similar number of randomly selected expressed genes . on the contrary, go term such as regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bmp signaling failed to correlate c-vsmcs and osteoblasts . in additional file 7: figure s <dig> the expression pattern of a selection of genes driving the correlation in the go-term biomineral tissue development and the anti-correlation in the go-term regulation of bmp signaling is shown. at least lep  and sost , from the correlation and anti-correlation group of genes respectively, could be validated distinct donors . moreover, we found good translation between leptin transcript and protein levels, especially for the donor used in the array . altogether, our results demonstrate that a specific subset of extracellular genes, including ecm genes, together with genes involved in the regulation of mineralization represent a common denominator between c-vsmcs and osteoblasts.figure  <dig>

discussion
the current comparative global gene expression profiling analyses of osteoblasts and c-vsmc demonstrate that vsmc under an osteogenic stimulus only partially mimic osteoblasts. despite the fact that c-vsmcs had an overall transcription profile distinct from osteoblasts, the two cell types regulated identically subsets of ecm and biomineralization genes. these results support the hypothesis that vsmcs require specific osteoblast-related gene modulation and mechanisms to transdifferentiate into c-vsmcs.

the mechanisms responsible for the transformation of a contractile vsmc into a stiff, mineral surrounded cell are still poorly understood. we demonstrated that the whole vsmcs pool has osteogenic potential and progresses towards alp + cells when exposed to osteogenic stimuli. this indicates that c-vsmcs are not derived from a small and specific vascular cell subpopulation with osteogenic potential, as shown in other vascular calcification models  <cit> . the relatively homogenous c-vsmc population  observed in our study enabled us to use global gene expression profiles.

genome-wide gene expression analyses in in vitro models of pathological and physiological mineralization revealed important characteristics of vascular calcifications. c-vsmc development  comprised three major phases. the first phase contained vsmc before being triggered to transdifferentiate . when vsmc were exposed to an osteogenic stimulus, their transcriptional program was quickly altered entering a transient intermediary stage  after which transcriptional changes became more subtle . we believe that the intermediary phase represents a commitment period responsible for the transition of vsmc into c-vsmcs. in this respect, the clusters of genes identified to be down-regulated  were particularly interesting due to their annotation to go-terms involved in the regulation of cell cycle, cell division and transcription. we believe that the modulation of genes with such functions is possibly associated to the switch of vsmc from proliferative into transdifferentiating cells  <cit> , an effect observed in osteoblasts under the influence of glucocorticoids  <cit> .

regarding the comparative transcription profiling, we identified  <dig> ecm genes identically regulated by c-vsmcs and osteoblasts. their common modulation pattern strongly supports their structural and/or regulatory role in both forms of calcification. on the other hand, ecm genes that did not share identical expression in both cell types are likely to be less crucial for mineral deposition. however, ecm gene data are yet difficult to interpret since little is known about the function of most of the proteins encoded by these genes in matrix mineralization. genes like dcn, mgp and postn constitute exceptions, being known for their crucial role during bone formation and mineralization  <cit> . mgp for example is a potent inhibitor of calcification both in bone and in the vasculature  <cit> . these genes represent a strong evidence for the implication of the other ecm genes, with yet unknown relationship to matrix mineralization, in vascular calcifications. this evidence is further substantiated by the fact that several ecm genes  are targets of activin a, a potent inhibitor of ecm mineralization  <cit> . recently we have identified over  <dig> different proteins present in bone tissue  <cit> . it is conceivable that ecm proteins act in concert with each other and that the combination of ecm proteins eventually determines the extent of mineralization. it will be a great challenge to identify and characterize these interactions. the current study demonstrating only a limited overlap in ecm gene expression between osteoblasts and c-vsmc will facilitate this challenge by enabling to focus on the selection of overlapping ecm genes. additional studies focusing on this subset of genes are essential to prove their involvement in biomineralization and during the atherosclerotic process in particular.

besides ecm, analysis of genes differentially regulated during physiological and pathological calcifications revealed that c-vsmcs share specific genes related to the go-term biomineral tissue development. alpl , gpnmb , lep , ptn  and srgn  were among genes within this go-term that have been already studied in the context of tissue calcifications. alpl has been shown to be fundamental for mineralization. this pyrophosphatase inactivates the mineralization inhibitory pyrophosphate  <cit>  facilitating not only bone but also vascular calcifications  <cit> . together with alpl, lep and gpnmb are genes capable to promote calcifications. lep is an energy metabolism hormone that enhances mineralization both in bone  <cit>  and in vascular tissue  <cit>  while gpnmb, is a glycoprotein implicated in end-stage renal disease  a pathological condition associated to ectopic calcifications  <cit> . biomineral tissue development genes did not include only genes favouring mineral deposition. srgn was recently described as an inhibitor of osteoblast mineralization  <cit> . despite not described with respect to ectopic mineralizations, the up-regulation of this gene during c-vsmc development might represent a mechanism to protect the vasculature from calcifications similarly to what is described for mgp  <cit> .

our comparative gene expression profiling constitutes a powerful tool to identify novel targets to control physiological as well as pathological calcifications. nevertheless, our bioinformatics approach was limited to the identification of genes currently annotated in go databases as belonging to ecm or involved in biomineralization. we hypothesize that more ecm and biomineralization genes are involved in both forms of calcification but because they are not yet annotated as such they were missed in our analysis. a limitation of our approach is related to the heterogenic response across primary cell sources  <cit>  leading to distinct temporal dynamics during differentiation and mineralization. overall, results obtained by gene expression array could be confirmed using qpcr within the same donor . however, analysis of  <dig> distinct donors revealed less consistent results, likely due to the natural variability of these primary cells and their donors  <cit> .

correlation analysis of bone-related genes expressed during vsmc transdifferentiation showed groups of genes negatively correlated between c-vsmcs and osteoblasts, substantiating the uniqueness of the former cell type. for example, genes of the important osteoblast bmp/tgf-β/activin signaling cascade  were oppositely regulated by c-vsmcs and osteoblasts. the divergence of these genes in c-vsmcs and osteoblasts supports the concept of cell-specific pathway modulations in both cell types. this is something recently observed in other tissues/cells  <cit>  but not yet investigated with respect to medial vascular calcifications and bone. nevertheless, bmp <dig> is a gene that appears to corroborate this concept since it is described as promoter of normal osteoblast function  <cit>  and capable to prevent atherosclerosis  <cit> . more studies are needed to define the exact role of each of these genes and most importantly their cross-talk to other signaling pathways  <cit> , like the wnt signaling of which we have identified genes distinctly modulated between c-vsmcs and osteoblasts .

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, the different analyses support the hypothesis that vsmc transdifferentiate into c-vsmcs keeping their own identity while using mechanisms that osteoblasts use to mineralize. extracellular  genes and genes involved in tissue mineralization constitute important common denominators between pathological vascular and physiological bone calcifications. a limitation of our study is that one still has to study heterogeneous msc and vsmc populations that differ from donor to donor in magnitude of gene expression and temporal dynamics, which relates to differences between donors we observed. nevertheless the current study provides novel insights into groups of genes and biological processes shared in msc and vsmc osteogenic differentiation. our data ought to be tested in a wider pool of primary cell donors in order to further discriminate the consistently regulated genes. finally, distinct gene regulation between c-vsmc and osteoblasts might be of interest to find cell-specific pathway modulations, opening the possibility to tackle undesired vascular calcifications without disturbing physiologic bone formation and vice versa.
