BACKGROUND
although it has been known for some time that histone modifications play a role in gene expression  <cit> , it is only in the last several years that the details of these modifications have been more fully described. acetylation and methylation of histone tails, for example, exhibit characteristic patterns for expressed and repressed genes in all eukaryotes studied  <cit> . this generality of histone modification and gene expression holds for eukaryotes with and without dna methylation, indicating that dna methylation is not required for histone modification. in organisms with dna methylation, however, interactions between histone modification and dna methylation do appear to exist.

in neurospora, histone methylation appears to determine dna methylation patterns  <cit> . in arabidopsis, non-cpg dna methylation also appears to be determined by histone methyltransferases, whereas cpg methylation does not  <cit> . in mammals, there is considerable evidence suggesting that methyl-cpg binding proteins may play a significant role in histone modification through their association with histone deacetylases  <cit> . mutations in the mecp <dig> methyl-dna binding protein, which are the cause of most rett syndrome cases  <cit> , support this model, because human male and female cells with mecp <dig> mutations exhibit histone hyperacetylation  <cit> . histone hyperacetylation was also observed in mice with mecp <dig> mutations  <cit> . thus, dna methylation is upstream of histone modification in this model of methyl-dna binding proteins and histone modification. another possibility is that dna methyltransferases themselves may target histone deacetylases through a noncatalytic domain, leading to histone modifications that are independent of other methyl-dna binding proteins  <cit> .

we are especially interested in the x chromosome with respect to the question of the relationship between dna methylation and histone modification. the mammalian x chromosome is unusual in that about a thousand gene-associated cpg islands are hypermethylated on the inactive x and hypomethylated on the active x. except for imprinted loci, methylation patterns at most other regions of the genome are similar between homologs. histone modification differences known to be associated with either silent or expressed chromatin also distinguish the active and inactive x chromosomes  <cit> . thus, the mammalian x chromosome inactivation system would appear ideal for testing whether or not a methyl dna binding protein â€“ histone modification pathway exists for the inactive x chromosome.

to examine more fully the possible relationships between dna methylation and histone modification, we have utilized cell cultures from individuals with a human hypomethylation disease called the icf syndrome. this disease is clinically characterized by "immune deficiency, centromeric region instability, and facial anomalies". in most cases, the molecular defects result from mutations in the dnmt3b methyltransferase gene  <cit> . certain heterochromatic regions are markedly hypomethylated as a result of these mutations, including the cpg islands on the inactive x chromosome that are associated with genes  <cit>  and line- <dig> elements  <cit> . if dna methylation is upstream of histone modification, the histones on the inactive x should not be modified to a silent form in icf cells. our results indicate, however, that these histones do have modifications typical of silenced genes, suggesting that methyl-dna binding proteins may not be critical with respect to histone modification on the inactive x chromosome. in addition, we examined clonal primary fibroblast cultures from two individuals with rett syndrome and found that the histone modification pattern of the inactive x is not affected by mutations in mecp <dig>  this suggests that this specific methyl-dna binding protein does not have a major role in silencing the inactive x through histone modification.

RESULTS
cytological analysis of histone modification
dnmt3b mutant cells 
we examined histone modifications known to be associated with the inactive x chromosome in two icf cell lines and normal control cells. specific histone modifications including histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation, and histone h <dig> methylation at k <dig> and k <dig>  were examined using antibodies to stain nuclei and metaphases  <cit> . we also examined histone macroh2a <dig> staining, which is known to be concentrated on the inactive x at interphase  <cit> . one hundred or more interphase nuclei that had an obvious sex chromatin body by dapi staining were scored for histone modification. for acetylated histone  and k4-methylated histone h <dig>  the majority  of nuclei showed a characteristic hole at the sex chromatin body in both normal and icf cells . for histone h <dig> methylation at k <dig>  the frequency of positive cells  was lower . we often noted a positive signal for methylated k <dig> histone h <dig> in an otherwise negative-staining sex chromatin region in both normal and icf cells . this signal appears to derive from the dxz <dig> locus that was previously reported by chadwick and willard  <cit>  as having active-type histone modifications. dxz <dig> is a megabase-sized region known to be hypermethylated on the active x and hypomethylated on the inactive x in normal cells  <cit> ; this locus appears to be modified normally in icf cells. surprisingly, we did not observe this signal on metaphase spreads, suggesting that our resolution on these preparations may be much lower than on interphase chromatin. for metaphase spreads  we analyzed  <dig> cells per line, and in the great majority of analyzable metaphases  a single lightly-labeled chromosome was detected . in some of these cells, the tip of the short arm was labeled, as would be expected for the pseudoautosomal region .

the expected patterns of macroh2a <dig> histone concentration and histone modification on the inactive x were found in cells derived from icf individuals and in control normal cells . at the cytological level, therefore, no difference could be found between normal and icf cells with respect to the histone modifications on the inactive x.

mecp <dig> mutant cells 
we examined histone modifications and macrohistone association in clones from two individuals heterozygous for a mutation in mecp <dig>  an x-linked gene that is subject to x inactivation  <cit> . mecp <dig> mutations lead to rett syndrome, and the protein product codes for a methyl-cpg binding protein known to recruit a transcriptional silencing complex that deacetylates histones. in rett syndrome and in mice with mutant mecp <dig>  histones exhibit hyperacetylation  <cit> , as would be expected if this methyl-dna binding protein functions upstream of histone modification. in one case, we had complementary clones with either the mutant  or wild type mecp <dig> allele  on the inactive x, and in the second case, we had one clone with the wild type mecp <dig> on the inactive x   <cit> . for all the histone modifications we examined , the cytological patterns on the active and inactive x chromosomes in mutant mecp2-expressing cells were indistinguishable from those in clones expressing the wild type allele or in other control cultures . these results suggest that mecp <dig> does not function in determining these histone modification patterns on the inactive x chromosome.

chip analysis
to verify our cytological histone modification results at the gene level, we searched for promoter polymorphisms at seven x-linked loci  in icf cells so that we could employ allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation  analysis. we restricted our search for polymorphisms to the promoter region, as several reports have indicated that marked differences in histone modifications between active and inactive alleles are seldom detected at other regions  <cit> . we found useful promoter polymorphisms at two loci, sybl <dig>  and ar .

previously, one of us  has reported on a chip study at the sybl <dig> locus in male icf cells where the inactive y allele had reactivated and the histone modification pattern was that of an active gene  <cit> . here we report on chip studies at the sybl <dig> and ar loci in icf female cultures using antibodies to histone h <dig> dimethylated at k <dig> and to acetylated histone h <dig>  both loci are subject to x inactivation, and the inactive x alleles remain inactive in icf cells even though the 5' cpg islands are hypomethylated  <cit> . in the case of the sybl <dig> inactive x allele, the methylation level is reduced by over 90% with most chromosomes exhibiting no methylation. an xhoi restriction site polymorphism in the untranslated exon  <dig> of sybl <dig> permitted separation of the active and inactive alleles in cloned cells. a cag repeat number polymorphism in the 5' coding region of the ar gene  was informative in one icf sample  and in several controls, thus permitting separation of the active and inactive alleles in cloned cells, and in cultures with highly skewed x inactivation. the antibodies were highly specific under the amplification conditions chosen, so that a strong signal was seen for the pull-down experiment with antibody and little or no signal for the "no antibody" control .

the fluorescent amplification products from the ar gene were then separated on an automated sequencer according to cag repeat number. two major peaks are detected in the input control dna, corresponding to the active  and inactive  x alleles, differing in cag repeat number . an allele was determined to be from the active x by rt-pcr analysis . the lesser "shadow band" peaks, labeled s, probably derive from pcr errors. in the methylated k <dig> h <dig> and acetylated h <dig> antibody chips, a single peak predominates in both normal and icf cells  that corresponds to the active x allele.

our chip analysis of the inactive x at the sybl <dig> locus in an icf female  also showed normal histone h <dig> hypoacetylation and k <dig> h <dig> hypomethylation in spite of the very low levels of dna methylation in this cpg island region . these data, therefore, agree with our cytological observations in that only the active x alleles are positive for the histone modifications known to be associated with active genes, though a minor portion of the inactive x allele was found to precipitate with the acetylated h <dig> antibody in both normal and icf cells .

discussion
the major observation reported here is that icf cells, despite being hypomethylated at gene- and l1-associated cpg islands on the inactive x chromosome, exhibit the same histone modification patterns as inactive xs in normal cells. in addition, we show that cells mutant for mecp <dig>  a methyl dna binding protein, also exhibit normal histone modification patterns on the inactive x. these results imply that dna methylation and/or this methyl dna binding protein are not critical for determining histone modification patterns on the inactive x chromosomes.

two major questions can be raised about our results:  is the sensitivity of the cytological histone modification assay too low to detect active-type histone modifications on the icf inactive x? and  is the extent of methylation on the icf inactive x greater than is suggested by cpg island and line- <dig> methylation patterns?

the cytological results imply that most of the genes on the inactive x in icf cells are subject to inactivation, a conclusion supported by our allele-specific expression analyses of individual genes, such as ar, in icf cells . for genes subject to x inactivation in icf cells, we expect histone modifications at the gene level to be similar to those detected cytologically at the chromosome level, and this is what we have shown here for the ar gene. for genes that escape x inactivation in icf cells, we expect their histone modification patterns to be those of expressed genes, and one of us  has previously reported this to be the case for the sybl <dig> gene . we did not detect these active patterns cytologically, suggesting that there are no large blocks of genes escaping inactivation in icf cells except at the xp pseudoautosomal region, which normally contains escaping genes .

methylation levels at inactive x-linked cpg islands in icf cells are decreased by an average of 89% from normal as determined by bisulfite analyses at the g6pd, fmr <dig>  and sybl <dig> loci, and many of the cloned alleles analyzed were completely unmethylated like active x alleles  <cit> . it is possible that dna methylation at other cpg-rich regions  on the x chromosome might be differentially methylated and play a role in the x chromosome histone modification pathway. one of us  has recently shown that line- <dig> elements are hypermethylated on both active and inactive x chromosomes in normal cells but, surprisingly, they are hypomethylated on the inactive x and hypermethylated on the active x in icf cells  <cit> . these results argue against a role for line- <dig> methylation in histone modification on the inactive x chromosome. a more complete dna methylation analysis of the icf and normal inactive xs needs to be done, however, because other widespread sequences may be hypermethylated on the icf inactive x that could direct histone modifications.

because we know that promoter methylation is important in gene expression, it seems reasonable that if dna methylation were directly involved in the histone modification pathway, cpg island methylation would play a critical role. further support for this idea comes from the fact that histone modifications distinguishing active and inactive x-linked genes are concentrated in promoter regions  <cit> . in fact, rougeulle et al.  <cit>  propose that the promoter-restricted histone modification seen at x-linked loci may be unique to monoallelically-expressed genes and provide them with an epigenetic mark.

that dna methylation is not critical to the developmental appearance of histone modifications is further supported by recent murine studies showing that differential histone modification of the xs in early development precede differential developmental appearance of dna methylation  <cit> . the fact that dna methylation does not appear to be critical to the development of histone modifications in x-linked gene expression should not be confused with a more important role for dna methylation in maintaining repression of x-linked genes. some years ago we showed that the earliest events in reactivating inactive x-linked genes were hemidemethylation followed by chromatin hypersensitivity, and then transcription factor binding and transcription  <cit> . more extensive studies have recently pointed to a similar conclusion  <cit> . thus, dna methylation appears to play a dominant role in maintaining repression, even though it is a late event in establishing silent chromatin.

we can also consider the implication of this work for the proposed role of methyl-cpg binding proteins in the histone modification pathway. our icf cell data and the results from murine developmental studies, showing that histone modification of x-linked genes precedes dna methylation, argue against such a role for the x chromosome. a role for methyl-dna binding proteins in the histone modification pathway is supported by studies with rett syndrome cells where a methyl-dna binding protein, mecp <dig>  is mutated. in both humans and mice with rett syndrome mutations, general hyperacetylation of histones was reported, albeit at different sites. in human cell lines, h <dig> was hyperacetylated preferentially at k <dig>  <cit> , while in mouse mutant tissues hyperacetylation was reported specifically at h3k <dig>  <cit> . in our work, however, we saw no major effect of two different mecp <dig> mutations on inactive x histone modification. the recent discovery that line- <dig> elements on the inactive x are methylated by a methyltransferase distinct from the one that carries out the same modification on the active x raises the possibility that the inactive x could have its own modification rules  <cit> . we must consider, therefore, the possibility that the inactive x chromosome does not utilize methyl-dna binding proteins in the histone modification pathway. such a possibility would fit with the failure to detect protein footprints at promoters on the inactive x chromosome, whereas they are readily detectable on the active x  <cit> . it should be noted that only a small fraction of possible histone modifications have been elucidated at this time, and it is possible that histone modification on the inactive x that depends on methyl-dna binding protein will be found in the future.

finally, we would like to comment on the implication of this study regarding the inactive x silencing complex. systems controlling gene expression tend to be multilayered and the x inactivation system is no exception. we know that silencing on the inactive x involves xist rna, dna methylation, histone modification patterns, chromatin sensitivity, and delayed replication. it is our opinion that these factors tend to act in a more or less independent manner, as we have suggested several times in the past  <cit> . for example, promoter demethylation of inactive x-linked genes, as occurs in icf cases, does not necessarily lead to reactivation; markedly advanced replication time must also be present for reactivation to take place  <cit> . the present study would appear to add further support to this idea.

CONCLUSIONS
the inactive x chromosome in mammalian cells is characterized by a particular set of histone modifications. it has been suggested that methyl-dna binding proteins may be involved in these modifications through their interactions with histone deacetylases. we have investigated this idea by studying histone modification patterns on the inactive x in icf and rett syndrome cells. icf cells are hypomethylated on the inactive x, in contrast to normal cells, and the rett cells we studied were deficient in mecp <dig>  a specific x-linked methyl-dna binding protein. we found that the histone modification patterns on the inactive x in these mutant cells were indistinguishable from those in normal cells. we conclude that dna methylation and the associated methyl-dna binding proteins do not appear to play a critical role in determining histone modification patterns on the mammalian inactive x chromosome, either globally or at the level of the promoter.
