BACKGROUND
cotton is one of the most important economic crops and provides the majority of natural fiber materials worldwide. plant height is an important trait in cotton, and dwarf cottons are more resistant to damage from wind and rain and associated with stable, increased yields. because of their agronomic importance, the different types of dwarf mutants have been isolated from rice  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> .

the development of dwarf cultivars has played a significant role in plant breeding, growth and development. however, fewer studies have been carried out in cotton species. hutchinson and ghose  <cit>  found a crinkled dwarf in upland cotton, which showed a normal phenotype during the seedling stage and a crinkled dwarf phenotype at the fourth- or fifth-leaf stage. genetic analysis showed the mutant to be controlled by a completely recessive gene. a novel super-dwarf mutant, named as <dig>  was discovered from an interspecific hybrid in  <dig>  compared to the normal line lhf10w <dig>  plant height and internode length were significantly shorter in as <dig>  but it had only slightly  fewer internodes  <cit> . the trait was controlled by a single incomplete-dominant gene, and exogenous gibberellins  <dig>  could restore plant height in as <dig>  in addition, a cotton mutant, pag <dig>  exhibited dwarfism due to significant inhibition of cell elongation and expansion, and brassinolide  treatment rescued its growth and fiber elongation  <cit>  these results indicate that most dwarf mutants are controlled by recessive genes, and involve very few dominant genes, and plant hormones play significant roles in plant height decision.

in plants, mirnas are small endogenous rnas and play negative regulatory functions at the post-transcriptional level by repressing gene translation or degrading target mrnas  <cit> . mirnas display near-perfect complementarities to their target mrnas and interfere with target gene expression by mrna cleavage, which occurs at the 10th and 11th positions of mirnas, or by inhibition of translation in plants  <cit> . the path in which mirnas work is determined by the sequence complementarity of mirnas to their target mrnas. if the mirna has a perfect sequence complementarity to the mrna, the mrna is targeted for cleavage; or, protein translation is inhibited  <cit> . most mirnas are high conserved among plant species  <cit> . there also exist non-conserved or species-specific mirnas which often expressed at very low levels, and many are not found in small-scale sequencing projects. recently, using next-generation sequencing technology, many new non-conserved mirnas with low abundance could be identified  <cit> .

many mirnas have been identified using experimental and/or bioinformatics approaches in various plant species  <cit> , the number of identified tissue-, species-, and developmental stage-specific mirnas is still limited because of their low accumulations levels. the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has allowed the mining of these specific low-abundance mirnas. to date,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mature mirnas have been uploaded to the mirbase database from zea mays, arabidopsis thaliana and rice, respectively  <cit> . however, only  <dig> mature mirnas from g. hirsutum had been annotated in the mirbase database . due to the limited numbers of g. hirsutum est sequences in the public ncbi database, data collected from transcriptome sequencing was used as reference sequences, which provide more valuable information for prediction of conserved mirnas.

numerous studies have indicated that mirnas have proven to be involved in many functional processes such as leaf development, shoot and root development, floral development, hormone response and stress adaption . mir <dig> was essential for root cap formation and proper plant development . mir <dig> was shown to be a phytohormonally regulated homeostatic modulator of gamyb activity and gamyb-depended developmental processes, such as flowering time and anther development  <cit> . the expression assay of mirnas under cd stress in m. truncatula found that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were up-regulated, whereas mir <dig> and mir <dig> were down-regulated  <cit> .

to investigate the relationships between mirnas and cotton plant height, three mirna libraries and three cdna libraries were constructed using the stem apex of three samples , and sequenced by solexa technology. then mirnas and their targets were analyzed. this is the first report that analyzes both dwarf mutant and tall-culm mutant under mrna and mirnas levels using high-throughput sequencing, and it will help us to investigate the dwarf mutant gene for further cotton dwarf breeding.

RESULTS

the mirna expression level in mutant libraries and wild type library were compared. total  <dig> mirnas corresponding to  <dig> families were identified as being differentially expressed by comparing these three non-redundant libraries . and all the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas in cotton including ghr-mir162a, ghr-mir164a, ghr-mir167a, ghr-mir2949b, ghr-mir2949a-5p, ghr-mir390a, ghr-mir394a, ghr-mir396a, ghr-mir399d, ghr-mir482a and ghr-mir <dig> were up regulated in dwarf mutant  but down regulated in tall-culm mutant  compared with the wild type , and three mirna, ghr-mir <dig>  ghr-mir2949a-3p and ghr-mir393b-5p were highly expressed in the dwarf mutant  compared with that in the tall-culm mutant  .table  <dig> known g. hirsutum mirnas identified in each library

twenty nine precursors were identified using mirdeep  <dig> , and  <dig> mirna*s  were also detected for the knowing mirnas with precursors. mirna* sequences are rarely detected via conventional sequencing because of their rapid degradation in cells. the detection of mirna* represented further evidence for the existence of mature mirnas.

expression pattern analysis of mirnas and their targets
to confirm the unigenes obtained from sequencing, eight unigenes related to hormone were chosen for qrt-pcr analysis. these qrt-pcr results were consistent with those obtained from the deg expression profiling. for example, the expression of gid <dig> was both up-regulated in a <dig> and a <dig> as compared with a <dig>  however, gid <dig> showed an opposite tendency . then, the expression levels of randomly selected representative mirna species were further determined through stem-loop qrt-pcr. results showed that the relative abundance of almost all the mirnas determined by stem-loop qrt-pcr followed similar trends as the read numbers in the libraries. as shown in fig. 6b, three mirnas  were down regulated both in a1–a <dig> and a3–a <dig>  three mirnas  up-regulated in a1–a <dig> but down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  and one mirna  down regulated in a1–a <dig> but up-regulated in a3–a <dig>  in addition, two mirna and their targets were validated using qrt-pcr and stem-loop qrt-pcr. as shown in fig. 6c, ath-mir858b was up-regulated in a1–a <dig> but down-regulated in a3–a9; its target myb gene  was down-regulated in a1–a <dig>  but it did not change significantly in a3–a <dig>  the gma-mir166h-3p was down-regulated while its target abf was up-regulated both in a <dig> and a <dig>  both the two results of the qrt-pcr and rna sequencing were consistent.fig.  <dig> validation of the expression patterns of the predicted degs and mirnas by qrt-pcr and stem-loop qrt-pcr in dwarf mutant and tall-culm mutant. a  <dig> degs were validated by qrt-pcr in the mutants compared with that of wild type. b the expression patterns of five mirnas were confirmed using stem-loop qrt-pcr. c two mirnas and their targets were validated using qrt-pcr and stem-loop qrt-pcr. the white bars represent the relative expression levels of stem-loop qrt-pcr or qrt-pcr. the equation ratio = 2△△ct was applied to calculate the expression level relative to wild type ari <dig>  using ghubq <dig> as the reference gene. three biological replicates and three technical replicates were performed. the black bars represent  of data of srna-seq. a1: ari <dig>  dwarf mutant; a3: ari <dig>  tall-culm mutant, a9: wild type ari971



validating mirna/target interactions using paresnip
paresnip program was utilized to validate the different expressed mirna/target interactions and make an in-depth survey of cleavage sites in transcripts and corresponding small rnas. in the dwarf mutant , paresnip reported  <dig> interactions. the  <dig> interactions are shown in additional file  <dig>  when comparing the results of sets  <dig> and our sequenced mirna/target, we validated a total of  <dig> conserved interactions between small rnas and corresponding transcript genes. there were  <dig> mir172/ap <dig> factor,  <dig> mir160/comp38451_c0_seq <dig> ,  <dig> mir159/ myb proto-oncogene protein,  <dig> mir319/myb proto-oncogene protein,  <dig> mir858/myb proto-oncogene protein, and  <dig> ath-mir393a/ comp45893_c0_seq <dig>   . in the tall-culm mutant , paresnip reported  <dig> interactions. these interactions are shown in additional file  <dig>  when comparing the results of sets  <dig> and our sequenced mirna/target,  <dig> conserved interactions were validated. there were  <dig> mir172/ap <dig> factor,  <dig> mir159/myb proto-oncogene protein,  <dig> mir160/comp38451_c0_seq <dig>  and  <dig> mir858/ myb proto-oncogene protein . comparing the two sets, we found that mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> were up-regulated in a1–a <dig> but down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  whereas mirna <dig> showed the opposite regulation. in addition,  <dig> mir319/ myb proto-oncogene protein were up-regulated and only expressed in a1–a <dig>  these data suggest that mirna <dig>  mirna <dig>  mirna <dig>  mir <dig> etc. maybe regulate the plant height mutation in cotton.

discussion
previous studies of dwarf mutants indicate that plant hormones, such as ga  <cit>  and brassinosteroids   <cit> , play significant roles in plant height decision. thus, the mutants in plant hormones synthesis or signaling show dwarf phenotypes: the semi-dwarf rice results from sd <dig> gene, which encodes a ga20oxidase , and dwarf <dig> dwarves result from mutations in a ga3ox gene ; loss of function mutations in gid <dig> or gid <dig> result in dwarf phenotypes, whereas gid <dig> overexpression causes ga hypersensitivity and internodes elongation. reduction in expression of zmdwf <dig>  a maize homolog of dim1/dwf <dig>  resulted in dwarf maize plants  <cit> . furthermore, plant height variation was controlled by quantitative trait loci : loci rht-d <dig> and rht-b <dig> had the largest effects on plant height in european winter wheat cultivars and that other small- or medium-effect qtl  and potentially epistatic qtl enable fine adjustments in plant height  <cit> ; many qtls, including qph.cgb-2d. <dig>  qph.cgb-4b. <dig>  qph.cgb-4d. <dig>  and qph.cgb-5a. <dig> coincident with reduced height  genes , interacted with more than one other qtl, indicating that the genetic architecture underlying plant height development is a network of genes with additive and epistatic effects  <cit> . in our previous study, two qtls qph-lg6- <dig> and qph-11- <dig> for the plant height of the drawf mutant ari <dig> were found with a distance of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm to the nearest marker of nau <dig> and dpl <dig> respectively  <cit> . in this study, mirna and their target genes related to plant hormones , cell growth and redox reactions were involved in the cotton height.

iaa and aba was related to the plant height in cotton
apical dominance in a primary shoot or inflorescence inhibits axillary meristem growth. measurement and exogenous application of plant hormones and the generation of mutants with altered hormone levels have determined both the inhibitory and promoting effects of auxin in controlling apical dominance  <cit> . the phytohormone auxin regulates plant growth and development by controlling the fundamental processes of cell division, expansion, and differentiation. additional studies have demonstrated that iaa is important during plant growth and development. however, while iaa in low concentrations stimulates growth and development, higher concentrations can be toxic to the plant  <cit> . therefore, tight control of iaa concentration is necessary for proper plant development. the iaa content of dwarf mutant  was higher than that of the wild type  in our study.

the transcriptome analyses showed that plant hormone signal transduction pathway was enriched of a1–a <dig> and a3–a <dig> with p-value as  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively. auxin exerts its regulatory role, at least to an extent, by rapidly inducing a group of genes that are collectively termed as early auxin response genes. these genes are categorized into three major classes: aux/iaas, saurs and gh3s  <cit> .

saur genes, which currently count  <dig> members together with saur-like genes on the tair web site , encode small proteins with estimated molecular masses of 9–12 kda. although the biochemical or developmental functions of this family remains largely unknown, the members have been reported to accumulate within  <dig>  min after auxin treatment  <cit> , to be correlated with elongating tissues  <cit>  and to negatively influence synthesis of auxin and proteins for polar auxin transport  <cit> . recent studies of the saur <dig> and saur <dig> subfamilies have implicated these saurs as positive effectors of cell expansion  <cit> . saur <dig> family proteins increased hypocotyl and leaf size, altered tropic responses, and defects in apical hook maintenance  <cit> . likewise, saur <dig> fusion proteins confer several cell expansion phenotypes including increases in hypocotyl, petal, and stamen length  <cit> . in the present study, saur was down-regulated with the fold change as − <dig>  in a1–a <dig>  while the fold change was  <dig>  in a3–a <dig>  it was suggested that lower expressed saur inhibited the plant growth in dwarf mutant.

the gh <dig> genes encode a group of enzymes that adenylates iaa, salicylic acid, or jasmonic acid  <cit> . the gh <dig> enzymes also conjugate free iaa with amino acids. consistent with the biochemical activities, arabidopsis mutants with elevated gh <dig> expression, such as dfl1-d  <cit> , and dfl2-d  <cit> , display reduced growth and altered leaf shape. in dwarf mutant, the fold change of gh <dig> showed  <dig> ,while it was − <dig>  in high mutant, compared with wild type. it was referred that high abundant gh <dig> inhibited the plant growth in cotton.

the auxin signaling pathway requires the auxin response factor , such as arf <dig>  arf <dig>  and arf <dig> in arabidopsis which are the targets of mirna <dig>  plants expressing mir160-resistant arf <dig> exhibited pleiotropic developmental defects, including abnormal stamen structure and reduced fertility  <cit> . in this paper, mirna <dig> were validated to be up-regulated in dwarf-mutant but down-regulated in tall-mutant. it suggested that mirna <dig> played a negative regulation role in regulating cotton height.

taken together, these results suggest lower expressed saur and elevated expressed gh <dig> maybe relate to reduced growth of the plant height in the dwarf mutant  which is consistent with the higher auxin content in this mutant. furthermore, mirna <dig> target to arf in a reverse regulation way in the dwarf and tall-culm mutant indicated the mutation related to the auxin signaling pathway. however, how auxin regulated the cotton plant height through saur and gh <dig> regulated by the mirna <dig> need further researches.

in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, both in the dwarf mutant  and the tall-culm mutant  compared with the wild type , aba related genes had the greatest change. nced was down-regulated with fold change as − <dig>  in a1–a <dig>  but up-regulated with  <dig>  fold in a3–a <dig>  aba <dig> and aao <dig> were both down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  but they were not different significantly in a1–a <dig>  it has been documented that a rate-limiting step in aba biosynthesis is the oxidative cleavage of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid to produce xanthoxin, catalyzed by nced in plastids. in the cytosol, xanthoxin dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of xanthoxin to abscisyl aldehyde, which is converted to aba by aldehyde oxidase  <cit> . recent key studies in the vascular plant arabidopsis provide evidence of a pivotal role of pp2cs in the aba signaling pathway. in the absence of aba, group a pp2cs act through the physical interaction with subclass iii of plant-specific snrk <dig> and dephosphorylate the kinase activation loop, inhibiting aba signaling transduction. it is evident that group a pp2c is a central component in the induction of aba signaling and a negative regulator of abscisic acid signaling  <cit> . in a1–a <dig>  pp2c was up-regulated with fold change as  <dig> , while it was down-regulated with fold change as − <dig>  in a3–a <dig>  furthermore, an up-regulated aba responsive element binding factor  was targeted by gma-mir166u and gma-mir166h-3p down-regulated in the tall-culm mutant  compared with the wild type .

another aba responsive element binding factor  was also targeted by gma-mir166u and gma-mir166h-3p. mir <dig> and its targets regulate an array of plant developmental processes, including shoot apical and lateral meristem formation, leaf polarity, floral development, and vascular development. two activation-tagged mutants overproducing mir <dig> have recently been characterized. the men <dig> mutant overexpressing the mir166a gene exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes, such as stunted growth, disrupted floral structure, fasciated inflorescence stem, and enlarged shoot apical meristem   <cit> . the jba-1d mutant, in which the mir166g gene is activation-tagged, has also been isolated from an activation-tagging approach  <cit> . the mutant exhibited essentially identical phenotypes to those observed in the men <dig> mutant. it was demonstrated that mir <dig> plays a role in regulating meristem formation. in this work, both in a1–a <dig> and a3–a <dig>  the mir <dig> family were down-regulated. however, all the targeted genes did not change significantly except comp138319_c0_seq <dig>  in a3–a <dig>  it was referred that gma-mir166u and gma-mir166h-3p, the members of mir <dig> family, and their targeted gene, aba responsive element binding factor, were related to the plant height mutation.

cell growth related factors was involved in the plant height of cotton
smg <dig>  which are implicated in nonsense-mediated rna decay and in telomere metabolism, is crucial for completion of the meiotic cell cycle. two t-dna insertion mutants of smg7: smg7- <dig> and smg7- <dig> exhibited severe growth retardation  <cit> . in this work, the expression of smg <dig> did not change significantly in a3–a <dig>  however, it was down-regulated in a1–a <dig>  conserved mirna gra-mir <dig>  which targeted smg <dig>  was up-regulated in a1–a <dig> while it was down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  total  <dig> of  <dig> novel mirnas, including ghr-m1352-3p, ghr-m3014-3p, ghr-m3726-3p, ghr-m3818-3p, ghr-m4247-3p, ghr-m4971-3p, targeted smg <dig>  all of them were up-regulated in a1–a <dig>  but did not change significantly in a3–a <dig>  it was referred that gra-mir <dig>  the novel mirnas and their targeted gene smg <dig> were related to dwarf mutant.

pectate-lyases have previously been described as microbial extracellular enzymes that assist pathogenesis by cleaving of polygalacturonate blocks in the plant host cell wall. however, in situ hybridization studies in young zinnia stems show that pectate-lyases expression was associated with vascular bundles and shoot primordia. the mrna encoding this enzyme is up-regulated in vitro during both cell elongation and cell differentiation in response to auxin  <cit> . in this work, pectate-lyase was down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  however, it did not change significantly in a1–a <dig>  and pectate-lyase was targeted by osa-mir159f, which was up-regulated in a3–a <dig>  mir <dig> family including aqc-mir <dig>  ath-mir159a, osa-mir159f, pde-mir <dig>  pta-mir159a, ath-mir159c, and pta-mir159c, are related to axillary bud outgrowth  <cit> , salt and drought stresses  <cit> , flowering time  <cit> , and ethylene treatment  <cit> . according to our results, mir <dig> may also regulate the plant height.

redox reactions related factors was involved in the plant height of cotton
cytochrome p <dig> , a family of membrane-bound heme-containg proteins in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, mediated a wide range of redox reactions involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormones and secondary metabolites including aba  <cit> , ga, br, lignins, uv protectants, pigments, defense compounds, fatty acids and signaling molecules  <cit> . in our study, cytochrome p <dig> was targeted by gma-mir172k and osa-mir172c, which were both up-regulated in the dwarf mutant , but could not be detected in the tall-culm mutant  compared with the wild type . it was inferred that mir <dig> might be involved in dwarf mutant through targeting cytochrome p <dig> to interfere with the biosynthesis of terpenoids, such as ga, aba, carotenoids and defensive substance of plant  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  discovered that cytochrome p <dig> was targeted by cotton-specific mirna, mir2948-5p, indicating that the cytochrome p <dig> families were targeted by different mirnas in cotton.

myb gene was involved in the plant height of cotton
the myb gene family is one of the largest families in plant kingdom, and some of its members are regulated by mirnas. major functions of myb in arabidopsis include primary and secondary metabolism, cell fate and identity, developmental processes and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that mybs were targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . the mir <dig> targeted two myb genes, and one of which was gamyb, a myb transcription factor involved in ga signal transduction  <cit> . it induced downstream genes expression through combining with promoters of ga-responsive gene. in this study, two myb related genes was found to be targeted by mir <dig> in dwarf mutant . moreover, the down-regulated myb proto-oncogene protein was targeted by up-regulated ath-mir858b in a1–a <dig>  but it did not change significantly in a3–a <dig>  another two myb genes targeted by mir <dig> in tall-culm mutant , which maybe involved in a negative pathway to control plant height. therefore, it was suggested that both mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeting the myb genes in dwarf mutant  may contribute to the dwarfism of cotton plant. in addition, it was found recently that mir <dig> and mir <dig> regulate homoeologous myb <dig> gene functions in cotton fiber development  <cit> . myb <dig> gene promotes cotton fiber development and is functionally homologous to arabidopsis glabrous <dig>  in trichome formation. therefore, mir <dig> and mir <dig> not only regulated for plant height development, but also related to fiber development.

CONCLUSIONS
plant height is an important trait in cotton. in this study, we try to reveal the networks involved in regulation mechanism of plant height in gossypium hirsutum by comparision analysis of transcriptome and small rna sequencing of stem apexes at the fifth true leaf stage among the dwarf-mutant , tall-mutant  and their wild type . the transcriptome sequencing results showed that carotenoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction were the top  <dig> degs enriched pathways in both dwarf mutant  and the tall-culm mutant . the aba and iaa related factors were differentially expressed in the mutants. in the pathway, the aba related factors of aba <dig> and aao <dig> were the top two down-regulated genes in the tall-culm mutant compared with the wild type , but they did not change significantly in dwarf mutant . however, saur and gh <dig> which were related to iaa regulation showed the change by a contrary tendency. of the  <dig> known conserved mirnas,  <dig> were identified as known cotton mirnas. a total of  <dig> mirnas in a1–a <dig> and  <dig> mirnas in a3–a <dig> were identified to be differentially expressed. moreover,  <dig> mirnas with  <dig> annotated targets different expressed between a <dig> and a <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas with  <dig> annotated targets differentially expressed between a <dig> and a <dig>  furthermore, we have noticed that mirna <dig>  targeting aba related factors, were both down- regulated in a1–a <dig> and a3–a9; mir <dig> might be involved in dwarf mutant through targeting cytochrome p450; mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> targeting the myb genes may contribute to plant height. using paresnip, mirna160/auxin related factors, mirna172/ap <dig> factor, mir858/myb proto-oncogene protein, and mir159/myb proto-oncogene protein were validated. in addition, mirna <dig>  mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> were validated to be up-regulated in a1–a <dig> but down-regulated in a3–a <dig>  whereas mirna <dig> showed the opposite regulation. this work laid a foundation to elucidate further function of mirnas and how they interact with their targets in regulating the plant height.
