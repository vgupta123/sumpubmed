BACKGROUND
a population over  <dig>  million camels is estimated in ethiopia  <cit> , which is considered the third largest camel populated country in the world. all camels in ethiopia are owned by pastoralists  <cit> . camels play a central role in the livelihood of pastoralists through provision of milk, meat, and draught power and they also determine their wealth and social status  <cit> . despite their social, ecological and economic importance in ethiopia, until recently they were neglected by researchers and development planners and as a result little is known about productivity and health problems in camels compared to other livestock  <cit> .

camels suffer from various parasitic diseases, including toxoplasmosis, which have public health and economic importance  <cit> . toxoplasmosis is caused by an intracellular apicomplexa protozoan, t. gondii, found worldwide and in an exceptionally broad host range on earth  <cit> . camels acquire t. gondii infection through ingestion or inhalation of sporulated oocysts that are shed by cats or wild felids in the environment  <cit> . the prevalence of t. gondii infection in camels varies widely depending on the localities of the world  <cit> , ranging from  <dig> % in iran  <cit>  to  <dig> % in turkey  <cit> .

t. gondii infects one-third of the world human population. the infection can be life threatening during pregnancy and in immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . the disease is a major public health concern in many countries of the world  <cit> . in usa, it is the third leading cause of death from foodborne diseases  <cit> .

humans become infected with t. gondii mostly by ingesting raw or undercooked meat of infected animals or by ingesting food or water contaminated with oocysts  <cit>  and the parasite can be transmitted to the fetus by the passage of tachyzoites through the placenta  <cit> . the presence of t. gondii in milk  <cit>  and edible tissues  <cit>  of carrier camels indicate the possibility of transmission to humans; particularly in pastoral communities in which raw milk, and to some extent raw meat, can be frequently consumed  <cit> . recent reports from ethiopia indicate high seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in women of child-bearing age ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  <cit> .

studies done in different parts of ethiopia over the last 24 years indicated high seroprevalence of t. gondii infection in sheep  <cit> , goats  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , chicken  <cit>  and cats  <cit> . however, there is no single report of t. gondii infection in ethiopian camels so far. although dat and elisa tests have been widely used for detection of t. gondii infection in epidemiological studies, there are no reports on the comparative evaluation of the diagnostic capability of these diagnostic tests in naturally infected camels. this report compares serodiagnostic methods of t. gondii infection in camels using commercial kits , and isolation of the parasite from edible camel tissues, to estimate the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in camels. the role of the identified risk factors on the parasite transmission is also discussed.

methods
study area and study animals
the study was conducted in the fentale district  which is located in the east shewa zone of oromia regional state, ethiopia  at  <dig> kms east of addis ababa. it lies at an altitude range of 955- <dig> meters above sea level, and has an annual rainfall ranging from  <dig> millimeter  to 630 mm and mean temperature ranging from 29°c to 38°c. the vegetation comprises mix of acacia trees, bushes and shrubs that are common to the lowland areas of ethiopia. with its arid and semi-arid climate, pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems predominate in the area. the district is estimated to possess  <dig>   <dig> camels found in eighteen pastoral associations . pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems are practiced in  <dig> and  <dig> pas, respectively  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
map of the fentale district showing sampled pastoral associations  .



the study population consisted of camels of different age groups in selected pas of the district managed under the two production systems. the camels of both sex groups were classified by age into three categories   <cit> . ages of camels were recorded based on information from the owners and also estimated according to their dentations  <cit> .

study design, sample size determination and sampling method
cross-sectional and follow up experimental study designs were used for seroepidemiological and bioassay studies, respectively from november  <dig> to april  <dig>  out of  <dig> pas, a total of  <dig> pas  were chosen conveniently based on accessibility of the pas. camel herds in each of the selected pas were stratified by herd size into three: small , medium  and large  camels  <cit> . out of  <dig> camel herds found in the selected study pas ,  <dig> herds were randomly selected using the lottery method. then, all camels in selected herds were used to collect blood samples. since there has been no previous study on camel toxoplasmosis in ethiopia, 50% expected prevalence  and 95% confidence interval  with a 5% desired absolute precision  was considered to arrive at the required sample size  for the seroepidemiological study using the formula: n = p  z <dig> /d2)  <cit> . additionally, purposive sampling of blood from  <dig> camels was considered for sample selection by serology in order to use their heart and tongue for bioassay.

sample collection and transportation
blood samples for serum separation were collected from the jugular vein of apparently healthy camels using labeled plain vacutainer tubes following proper physical restraining. for the bioassay, heart, tongue and blood sample of purposively selected  <dig> camels, originating from fentale district but slaughtered at akaki abattoir near addis ababa, were collected. the collected samples were kept in an icebox containing ice packs and immediately transported to the ethio-belgium post-graduate research laboratory, college of veterinary medicine and agriculture, debre zeit, ethiopia for serological testing and isolation of t. gondii. sera were separated by centrifugation at 3200 rpm for 10 minutes, decanted into cryovials and stored at -20°c until used for serological assay. heart and tongue samples were kept at + 4°c for 1- <dig> days until serological results were known.

questionnaire survey
a close-ended questionnaire was designed and self-administered to collect data about the potential risk factors for camels to acquire t. gondii infection. awareness of camel owners about toxoplasmosis including the habits of consumption of raw camel meat and milk was also documented. the questions in the questionnaire included sex , age , production system , presence of cats , presence of wild felids , source of drinking water  and herd size   <cit> . information about history of abortion , way of handling aborted fetus  and method of disposal of aborted fetus  were recorded. moreover, camel owners consumption habits of camel meat  and raw milk consumption , educational level  and awareness about: toxoplasmosis , role of cat to transmit diseases to owner , role of cat to transmit diseases to camel  and camel migration  and routes of migration were also gathered.

laboratory investigation
direct agglutination test 
all sera samples collected were examined for the presence of antibodies  against t. gondii by the direct agglutination test  following the protocol of the manufacturer. the kit was claimed by the manufacturer to have sensitivity and specificity of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. sera were assayed at a screening dilution of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  a titer of 1: <dig> or 1: <dig> or both was considered indicative of t. gondii exposure. sedimentation of antigen at the bottom of the well and clear agglutination above half of the well at either dilution were recorded as negative and positive results respectively. dat positive samples were titrated to know the endpoint titer. positive and negative controls were included in each test.

indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
a total of  <dig>  sera were tested for t. gondii igg antibodies by the indirect elisa kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. the wells of the kit are coated with t. gondii p <dig>  surface antigen. the kit uses non-species specific protein conjugate that is used in several animal species. for interpretation of the result s/p% was calculated as: s/p% = / ×  <dig>  any sample with s/p% ≤ 40%, 40% - 50% and ≥ 50% were considered as negative, doubtful and positive, respectively. with this cut-off the manufacturer claims the test to have more than 99% specificity and sensitivity. the test was considered valid if the mean od value of the positive control  is greater than  <dig>   and the ratio of the mean od value of the positive and negative controls  is greater than  <dig>  . the doubtful sera were retested.

bioassay
heart and tongue tissue samples  from dat positive camels  slaughtered at akaki abattoir, were processed for isolation of t. gondii as described previously  <cit> . briefly, each sample was cut into small pieces, homogenized in a blender for 30 seconds, followed by soaking in 125 ml of saline solution for another 30 seconds . after homogenization 250 ml of pepsin solution  was added  and incubated at 37°c for 1 h. the homogenate was filtered through two layers of gauze and centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 10 minutes. the supernatant was discarded and to the sediment  <dig> to 20 ml of  <dig> % sodium bicarbonate  was added and centrifuged at 3200 rpm for 10 min. the supernatant was discarded and the sediment was re-suspended in  <dig> to 10 ml of antibiotic saline solution . the suspension was inoculated intraperitoneally  into five apparently healthy t. gondii seronegative female swiss-albino mice  per sample  as described by dubey  <cit> . bioassays were performed within 1- <dig> days of the slaughter of the camels. separate knives, cutting boards, gloves, plastic cups/falcon tubes, and plastic bags for blending and pepsin digestion were used for each sample to avoid contamination among samples. tissue homogenate kept in  <dig> falcon tubes  were centrifuged in  <dig> steps; the first and second batch in  <dig> and  <dig> floating buckets of the centrifuge. approximately 110- <dig> minutes elapsed from the time the tissue was homogenized in saline to the time the material was pulled into syringes for mouse inoculation. the inoculated mice were observed daily for illness for 60 days and information on number of survivors, dead, day of death, symptoms, and weight  were recorded. the mice were fed with pelleted feed and municipal chlorinated water ad-libitum. t. gondii isolate was considered as virulent if 100% mortality of mouse was observed within four weeks of infection  <cit> .

surviving mice were bled on day  <dig> after anesthetizing with di-ethyl ether . brains of all mice were removed by sagittal dissection and then examined for tissue cysts. the inoculated mice were considered infected with t. gondii when tissue cysts were found in brain tissues and/or the sera of mice react positively for the commercial dat. the brain was homogenized in 1 ml phosphate buffer saline  by using a mortar and pestle. the numbers of cysts in five aliquots of each 10 μl were counted under microscope with a  <dig> × and  <dig> × objective lens and summed. the total number of cysts in the brain of each mouse was determined by multiplying the number of cysts in the 50 μl sample examined with the dilution factor  <cit> .

data management and analyses
the data generated from field and laboratory investigations were entered and coded using microsoft excel®  <dig> and analyzed using stata version  <dig>  for windows . descriptive statistic was used to summarize the data. the information from the questionnaire survey was used to define explanatory variables to be tested in a logistic regression model, for any assessment of association between the serological status of the camels  and the risk factors . initially, all risk factors were individually screened by cross-tabulation for association with the likelihood of t. gondii infection using chi-squared analysis. non-collinear variables, with p-value <  <dig>  in the univariable analysis, were entered into the multivariable logistic regression model. during the analyses the clustering nature of the outcome within a herd was considered by including herd as a clustering variable. this enabled us to use a clustered sandwich estimator i.e., robust standard error rather than the standard error of the parameters estimated using maximum likelihood method. the results of the logistic regression for each variable were expressed as p-value and odds ratio  with 95% confidence intervals to measure the strength of associations. the seroprevalence results of dat and elisa tests were compared using the chi-squared test and their concordance was determined by calculating the kappa index. using dat as a reference test, the diagnostic sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value  and negative predictive value  of elisa were calculated and interpreted following the recommendations of dohoo et al.  <cit> . a student t-test was employed to assess the mean weight difference between seropositive and seronegative mice. differences were considered significant when p ≤  <dig> .

ethical considerations
this research project was approved by the animal ethical committee of the college of veterinary medicine and agriculture, addis ababa university. all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering during the course of the study. informed written consents were obtained from all camel owners who participated in the study.

RESULTS
animal level seroprevalence
an overall t. gondii prevalence of  <dig> %  by dat and  <dig> %  by indirect elisa test were detected. out of the  <dig> dat positive sera,  <dig>  were negative at 1: <dig> dilution but positive at 1: <dig> dilution. the serum samples collected from the abattoir were excluded from risk factor assessment because of missing information for most variables. a statistically significant difference in seroprevalence was observed between studied pas with the highest and lowest seroprevalence recorded from ilala  and galcha  pas, respectively . the seroprevalence was also significantly different between age groups , herd sizes  and history of abortion . however, there was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence between males and females  and pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems . using elisa, the pa  and history of abortion  were significantly associated with seropositivity . of the seropositive samples  <dig> %  had dat end titer of ≥  <dig>  the dat end titer of the seropositive camels  is shown in figure  <dig> table  <dig>

risk factors for t. gondii seropositivity
univariable logistic regression analysis
epidemiological risk factors for acquiring t. gondii between dat seroreactive and nonreactive camels were compared using univariable logistic regression analysis. during the statistical analysis the first level/category  of each independent variable was used as the reference category. the results showed that sex, herd size and production system had no significant association with t. gondii seropositivity of the camels  while study area, age, history of abortion, presence of domestic cats and presence of wild felids were found to be significantly associated with t. gondii infection  .table  <dig>

multivariable logistic regression analysis
stillbirth and neonatal mortality were not included in the multivariable model due to collinearity with abortion. five variables  that presented p-value <  <dig>  in the univariable analysis, were subjected to the multivariable regression model. the analysis showed a significant association between t. gondii seropositivity and study area  , age  and the presence of domestic cats . the results of the logistic regression analysis based on the results of the elisa were presented as additional file 1: table s3).

camel owners food habit and awareness about toxoplasmosis
all  camel owners who responded to the questionnaire survey were uneducated pastoralists, had no awareness about t. gondii, toxoplasmosis and its transmission to humans through raw meat and raw milk consumption. camel meat consumption habit showed that  <dig> % consume cooked meat and the rest  consume either cooked or uncooked meat. all respondents  consume raw camel milk, handle aborted fetus with bare hands  and don’t wash their hands after handling aborted fetus. furthermore, none of the camel owners bury or burn aborted materials; rather they simply dispose of by throwing it in the field.

comparison of seroprevalence results of dat and elisa tests
overall, the  <dig> serum samples were tested by both dat and elisa kits for comparison. a total agreement between the two tests was obtained on  <dig> positive samples  and  <dig>  negative samples. but  <dig> sera were positive only by dat test and  <dig> sera were positive only by elisa test. comparison of the two test results indicated that seropositivity differed significantly between the two kits . however, kappa analysis demonstrated that the two tests had a moderate agreement in detecting t. gondii infection in camels . by considering dat as a reference test, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of elisa was calculated as  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

bioassay
of the  <dig> camel sera from the abattoir,  <dig>   and  <dig>   were igg seropositive using dat and elisa, respectively. viable t. gondii cysts were isolated from  <dig> of  <dig> dat seropositive bioassayed camels . out of the  <dig> dat positive sera,  <dig> were positive for elisa and one elisa negative camel sample gave a cyst positive result. for two seropositive camel samples, isolation of the parasite was not possible because of the death of all of the inoculated mice within a day of inoculation. on day  <dig> post-inoculation, out of  <dig> mice that survived,  <dig>  were seropositive for t. gondii infection  gave a seropositive result on mice). viable cysts were isolated in mice from  <dig> tissue samples from the camels  . it was not possible to detect cysts from  <dig> of the seropositive mice. eleven out of  <dig> survived mice showed loss of weight , of which  <dig> and  <dig> mice were seropositive and seronegative, respectively, i.e.,  <dig> %  of seropositive and  <dig> %  of seronegative mice showed loss of weight. the mean weight change between seropositive  and seronegative  mice was significantly different . the mean cyst count per mouse brain was  <dig>  . one mouse that showed neurological signs  and tachypnoea on day  <dig> post-inoculation became cyst negative but seropositive.table  <dig>

discussion
overall seroprevalence
we report for the first time evidence for t. gondii infection and its seroprevalence, risk factors and bioassay results in ethiopian camels. an estimated overall seroprevalence of  <dig> % by dat and  <dig> % by elisa tests were detected. seventy-four percent of seropositive camels  had dat end titer of ≥  <dig>  this might indicate actively circulating, recently acquired or recrudescence of previously acquired t. gondii infection in camels of the study area due to climatic stress, malnutrition and prevalent diseases like trypanosomosis  <cit>  which reduce the animals’ resistance  <cit> . moreover, the seropositive sera that became negative at 1: <dig> but positive at 1: <dig> dilutions  indicate prozone phenomenon. presence of viable t. gondii cysts in  <dig> %  of camels slaughtered for human consumption is definitive diagnosis of natural t. gondii infection and suggests the potential transmission of toxoplasmosis to humans through consumption of raw or undercooked camel meat or offal such as the liver which is commonly consumed by pastoralists. considering the lower human population density , the arid and semi-arid climate of the fentale district, which is hostile for the survival of oocysts in the environment, and the browsing habit of camel feeding , the high seroprevalence found in the present study was not to our expectation. recently, a relatively lower seroprevalence of t. gondii in goats   <cit>  and in sheep   <cit>  was reported from the same district. however, the high seroprevalence in camels of the current study in our opinion might be a function of cumulative effect of the age of camels  <cit>  related to absence of regular culling programs. moreover, the migration of camels to midland areas in search of feed, the poor veterinary service, inadequate attention by government, local change in landownership and increased farming  <cit>  - which necessitate cat keeping to control rodents, might have additionally contributed to the high prevalence. the present seroprevalence  is in close agreement with the  <dig> % and 46% -  <dig> % seroprevalence reported from sudan  <cit>  and egypt  <cit> , respectively. as compared to the present finding, much higher seroprevalence has been reported from turkey  and sudan  by utuk et al.  <cit>  and elamin et al.  <cit> , respectively. lower seroprevalence was recorded earlier from iran  <dig> %  <cit> , saudi arabia  <dig> %  <cit> , 16%  <cit> ,  <dig> %  <cit> , sudan   <cit> , united arab emirates   <cit>  and egypt   <cit> . the variation in seroprevalence between the present study and aforementioned african and arabian countries might be due to the difference in density of cats and wild felids, climatic conditions  <cit> , farming and management practices  <cit> , sample size  <cit> , cut-off values and sensitivity difference in the serological tests employed  <cit> .

risk factors
assessment of the association of t. gondii seroprevalence with potential risk factors was made with the aim of identifying factors relevant for prevention of the disease. accordingly, using the results of dat, a multivariable logistic regression model revealed that study pa , exposure to domestic cats  and age of the camels  were found to be independent predictors of t. gondii seropositivity. on the other hand, only study pa  and exposure to domestic cats  were found to be independent predictors of t. gondii seropositivity using results of elisa . this suggests that dat is a more preferred test for assessing the risk factors in camels than elisa. camels from ilala pa  are  <dig>  times more likely to be seropositive than camels of galcha pa  . the observed difference in seroprevalence across pas could be due to differences in the age of camels sampled  <cit> , the sample size  <cit> , the degree of environmental contamination  <cit>  and the frequency of exposure to risk factors  <cit> . the seroprevalence of t. gondii infection was higher in camels older than 8 years  as compared to camels ≤ 4 years old. thus, the probability of t. gondii infection in camels increases as the age of the animal increases suggesting postnatal infection. the high seroprevalence in older camels than young camels might be due to the higher likelihood of exposure of older camels to any one of the risk factors to acquire t. gondii infection  <cit> . this finding is in harmony with the studies conducted in saudi arabia  <cit>  who reported a higher seroprevalence in adult than young camels.

the univariable logistic regression showed that the odds of being infected by t. gondii infection was higher in aborted camels than non-aborted camels  and in areas where the presence of wild felids was reported  than in their absence. however, these variables were not independent predictors of seropositivity in the final logistic regression model . the high seroprevalence in aborted camels is consistent with biological features of t. gondii in sheep, goats and pigs. t. gondii has been reported as an important cause of abortion in bacterian camels  <cit>  and in zoo camels in usa  <cit> .

there was no statistically significant sex-linked difference in seroprevalence between male  and female  camels. this is consistent with studies in dromedaries of sudan  <cit> , saudi arabia  <cit>  and bactrian camels of china  <cit> .

bioassay
as far as the bioassay result is concerned, tissue cysts were isolated from  <dig> %  of dat positive camels. bradyzoite tissue cysts were detected by microscopy in  <dig> %  of dat positive mice. this lower rate of detection of cyst by microscopy might be due to the low number of cysts in camel tissue and the low sensitivity of microscopy  <cit> . cyst count has also been reported to vary depending on the virulence of t. gondii strain and number of passages in the mice  <cit> . previously, viable tissue cysts have been isolated in cats from naturally infected camels in saudi arabia  <cit> . it has also been reported that the success of isolation of t. gondii cysts as well as the number of tissue cysts produced vary considerably with the intermediate hosts, being higher in sheep, goats and pigs  <cit> . the number of isolated tissue cysts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per brain of mice, which is low compared to the number of cysts/mouse brain isolated from sheep and goats of the same district . more sensitive methods like pcr might detect the dna of tissue cysts in the brain of seropositive mice presently reported perhaps as false negative due to the small volume of brain homogenate examined , lower sensitivity of microscopy and the possible low burden of viable cysts in tissue of camels  <cit> . even though detection of brain cysts was not possible, manifestations of tachypnoea and neurological signs by a mouse on day  <dig> post-inoculation might indicate the more virulent nature of the strain  <cit> . the death of mice in less than 3 days following i.p. inoculation was attributed to septic peritonitis that resulted from bacterial contamination of isolates or unintended puncturing of the intestine or other vital organs  <cit> .

comparison of seroprevalence results of dat and elisa
comparison of the diagnosis of t. gondii infection of camels by dat and elisa showed moderate agreement . we think that the discrepancies between the results of dat and elisa might be ascribed to the difference in the sensitivity and specificity of the tests in camel. dat is more sensitive than elisa which is in accordance with findings of dubey  <cit>  and shaapan et al.  <cit>  who reported dat as the most sensitive test among all serological tests. it has also been reported that test performances may vary when applied on different animal species  <cit> . for example, as opposed to our finding, zhu et al.  <cit>  from beijing, china, reported significantly high t. gondii seroprevalence by elisa  as compared to dat  in dogs , while no significant difference between the two tests was reported in the case of cats. the p <dig> elisa test we used in the current study employs non-species specific conjugate and was recommended by the manufacturer to detect anti-t. gondii antibodies in ruminant, cat or pig sera, plasma or meat juice. however, literature with regards to validation of this kit for camels was not accessible; consequently comparison of our results with others couldn’t be made possible. nevertheless, isolation of viable cysts from four of five camels positive by elisa  coupled with the relatively higher specificity  and ppv  of elisa in the present study, suggests the usefulness of the p <dig> elisa test in epidemiological studies of camel toxoplasmosis particularly among highly disease prevalent populations and in instances of abortion storms  <cit> . although in the present study dat is more sensitive than elisa, the subjective nature and longer waiting time before reading the results might limit widespread and large scale usage of dat for epidemiological studies  <cit> .

camel owners’ food habit and awareness about toxoplasmosis
from the questionnaire data it was evident that all of the respondents were uneducated and have a very poor knowledge of t. gondii and its mode of transmission between animals, to humans and the role of felids in the epidemiology of the disease. the lack of knowledge about the disease is one of the main risk factors exposing individuals to the disease, as all of them drink raw camel milk and  <dig> % responded that they eat either cooked or raw camel meat.

human cases of toxoplasmosis have previously been linked directly to the consumption of raw goat’s milk  <cit>  and camel milk  <cit> . recently, t. gondii tachyzoites have been detected from milk of naturally infected camels in iran using elisa, pcr, cell culture and cat bioassay  <cit>  and from experimentally infected camels in sudan  <cit> . the high seropositivity and moderately high rate of isolation of viable tissue cysts from edible organs in the current study might be of great public health significance. this is due to the deep rooted habit of consumption of raw camel milk, offal  and to a lesser extent, meat by the pastoral communities of the study area. moreover, the absence of precautions in handling aborted materials and poor knowledge of pastoralists about toxoplasmosis and the role of cats in the transmission of the disease are additional suggestive evidences for the spread of toxoplasmosis to humans and among camels in the study district. in the absence of a vaccine for camels and the difficulty in changing the pastoral extensive livestock management system to intensive management to reduce the prevalence of the disease, prevention of the disease through education of pastoralists remains a better alternative and perhaps a more economically feasible option to combat the disease.

the limitations of the current study include interviewee recall bias, the relatively small number of camels considered for bioassay and the inability to genotype the isolates due to a shortage of resources. further studies to improve the sensitivity and specificity of elisa for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in camels are required.

CONCLUSIONS
t. gondii infection of camels in the study district is widespread. age, presence of domestic cats and study pa are independent predictors of t. gondii seropositivity. isolation of viable parasites from edible tissues of camels and the very poor knowledge of pastoralists about toxoplasmosis, suggest that people are at a higher risk of acquiring t. gondii infection. therefore, prevention of toxoplasmosis through biosecurity measures, education of pastoralists about the identified risks and further investigation to unravel the economic and public health implications of the high prevalence of t. gondii in the area deserves consideration.
