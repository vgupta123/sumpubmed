BACKGROUND
sin <dig> was originally described as a human protein that modulated ras function in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . strains of yeast that expressed the constitutively activated ras2val  <dig> mutation had elevated levels of cyclic amp, impaired growth control and were acutely sensitive to heat shock. this phenotype was reversed when the yeast strain was transfected with a cdna  that encoded a then unknown protein. although the authors suggested that the inferred interaction between the jc <dig> product and ras might be fortuitous, they favored the possibility that that the unknown protein either was a true inhibitor of ras or that it was a ras target protein, which when over-expressed, had a protective action. a s. cerevisiae protein encoded by the avo <dig> gene showed distant similarity the human jc <dig> product  <cit> .

approximately eight years after the identification of jc <dig> it was again identified, on this occasion in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a schizosaccharomyces pombe cdna library as a  <dig> amino acid protein that bound via polypeptide sequences in its c-terminal  <dig> amino acids to the sty1/spc <dig>  stress activated map kinase   <cit> . a fission yeast strain lacking the sin <dig> gene was sterile, sensitive to multiple types of stress, including heat shock, and had delayed cell cycles compared to a parental strain. sin <dig> acted downstream of activated sty1/spc <dig> and appeared to be necessary for normal function of the transcription factor atf <dig>  a homolog of human atf <dig>  wilkinson et al.  <cit>  found that an apparent full length homolog of sin <dig> from chicken allowed the heat sensitive strain of s. pombe to grow at 37°c, albeit very poorly. moreover, fusion of the first  <dig> amino acids of yeast sin <dig>  with the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids of the chicken sin <dig> sequence protected against heat shock. together, these data showed that sin <dig> functions as a component of the stress-activated sty1/spc <dig> map kinase pathway in s. pombe and that a functional homolog of sin <dig> exists in vertebrates.

no further information concerning sin <dig> appeared since the paper of wilkinson et al.  <cit>  until our discovery that the ovine  sin <dig> associated via its c-terminus to the cytoplasmic domain of ifnar <dig>  a subunit of the type i ifn receptor  <cit> , and schroder et al.  <cit>  described transcripts for sin <dig> in human tissue and provided an analysis of the human gene. the latter study confirmed that sin <dig> was relatively well conserved across metazoa and fungi  and was also represented in amoebae, but not in other protozoan species.

ovine sin <dig>  which is 88% identical in sequence to chicken sin <dig>  can be co-immunoprecipated with the ifn receptor subunit ifnar <dig> and shows a similar subcellular distribution to the receptor protein when co-expressed in mammalian cells  <cit> . although ovsin <dig> was identified from a cdna present in ovine endometrium and was initially considered to have a role in reproduction associated with the action of ifn-τ on the uterus during early pregnancy in the sheep, it became clear that the sin <dig> gene was expressed in tissues other than endometrium and might have a general role in the action of type  <dig> ifn. in particular, it seemed possible that sin <dig> might link the action of ifn to the stress activated sapk signal transduction pathways. such a linkage has been inferred from earlier studies in which early activation of p <dig> mapk had been noted following exposure of a variety of cell lines to ifn-α, -β, or -τ  <cit> .

although the sapk pathway is itself ancient and is found in all the species in which the sin <dig> gene exists, the ifn system of receptors and ligands is restricted to vertebrates. we reasoned, therefore, that an analysis of sin <dig> gene sequences might not only provide insight into the function of sin <dig>  but indicate how the protein evolved to interact with ifnar <dig>  the fact that the sin <dig> gene appears to be expressed ubiquitously, that it is highly conserved across a wide range of taxa, and that it is a likely participant in several important signaling pathways, makes it an intriguing candidate for a functional/evolutionary analysis.

RESULTS
conservation of the sin <dig> gene from yeast to mammals
a combination of searching methods was employed to locate sin <dig> genes in available cdna and genome data bases . sin <dig> sequences were found in two yeast species , the red bread mold  and a number of other fungal species , caenorhabditis elegans, a mosquito species , fruit fly , frog , two fish species , chicken , mouse , rat , human , sheep , cattle , and pig  . no apparent ortholog could be detected in the plant arabidopsis thaliana. nor could sequences corresponding to sin <dig> be found in protozoa other than amoebae and prokaryotic species.

"comments" briefly describe the methods used to obtain the sequences.

the marked dissimilarity in inferred amino acid sequence between sin <dig> from vertebrates and c. elegans , between the two yeast species  and between s. pombe and n. crassa  in the approximately  <dig> aa of overlap suggests that even if homologs existed in plants and prokaryotes they would likely be overlooked by the search methods employed.

 <dig>  sequences and their genbank accession numbers are: o. aries , b. taurus , h. sapiens , s. scrofa , m. muscus , r. norvegicus , g. gallus , x. laevis , f. rubripes , d. melanogaster , a. gambiae ; s. pombe ; n. crassa .

sin <dig> from the yeast species, s. cerevisiae and s. pombe which consist of  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa, respectively, and also from the red bread mold, n. crassa  are much longer than sin <dig> from vertebrate and insect species, which are ~ <dig> aa long. the regions of similarity among these three fungal proteins are confined entirely to the carboxyl termini of these molecules, although several gaps have to be introduced to align them. no similarities are detectable in the amino terminal extensions, which, in the case of s. cerevisiae, is  <dig> aa long. it is the carboxyl regions of the fungal proteins that can also be aligned with the sin <dig> sequences from c. elegans, insects, and vertebrate species, including ovis aries, the sheep .

a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from an alignment of amino acid sequences of sin <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  as anticipated, the sequences from the three fungi, c. elegans, the two insect species, and vertebrate species fell into distinct branches of the tree. the sequences for the mammalian species were tightly clustered, with identities ranging from 99%  to  <dig> %  . all the vertebrate cdna encoded polypeptides of  <dig> aa .

there is considerable conservation of sin <dig> from mammals to birds , amphibians , and fish  . the insect sequences are rather longer than the ones from vertebrates, and several gaps have to be introduced to provide alignments . nevertheless, the insect amino acid sequences are approximately 33% identical to those of the mammals . five blocks of sequence  are significantly more conserved than others when two insects, a fish, an amphibian, a bird and several mammals are compared . three of these regions are located towards the n-terminus and two additional regions towards the c-terminus. the most diverse region is located centrally.

the region of the greatest identity between these divergent insect and vertebrate sequences is an acidic region placed in conserved scd iii . in mammals, this region is completely conserved and corresponds to residues l232-k <dig> . however, an analysis of this sequence reveals no known functional motifs and no strong similarity to sequences represented in other known proteins. schroder et al.  <cit>  have also noted this conserved sequence in their analyses of sin <dig> sequences and have named it crim for conserved region in the middle.

sin <dig> from c. elegans retains the highly conserved  <dig> amino acid scd i and the  <dig> amino acid domain iii . scd iii is also retained in the fission yeast and the red bread mold.

vertebrates possess several unique sequences not present in insects and yeast, and, therefore, potentially implicated in the ifn signal transduction pathway including a carboxyl terminal region  immediately following the end of scd v.

functional motifs in the sin <dig> primary sequence
when the ovine sin <dig> sequence is scanned for functional motifs  <cit> , the structure appears unusually barren. two weak bipartite nuclear localization signals   <cit>  can be detected. one  is present in the scdii domain, and the other  is almost at the c-terminus within conserved domain v . nevertheless, data from the subcellular localization experiment showed that sin <dig> is excluded from the nucleus when transfected in cos <dig> or l <dig> cells  <cit> , suggesting these nls are probably not functional.

there are numerous motifs that are recognized as potential but weak sites for phosphorylation by either casein kinase ii , protein kinase c, or protein kinase a . none of the  <dig> ck <dig> sites, the  <dig> protein kinase c, or the  <dig> protein kinase a sites present in the ovine sin <dig> primary sequence are conserved from mammals to fission yeast, although many are retained across all vertebrates. a weak site for myristylation , and hence for membrane association, is retained in all the vertebrate species examined, but is absent in insects and yeast. in absence of any data on the functional significance of these sites, they will not be discussed further.

gene structure of sin <dig> from various species
the genomic sequence encompassing the transcribed region of the gene could be retrieved from the genome data bases for s. pombe, s. cerevisiae, c. elegans, d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, f. rubripes, r. norvegicus, m. musculus, h. sapiens  <cit> . sin <dig> exists as a single copy gene in all these species. for example, the human sin <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig>   with the transcribed region composed of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns and spanning a region of about  <dig> kb . exon  <dig> is spliced out of the shorter form of sin <dig>  <cit> . the lack of exon  <dig> does not cause a frame shift because the intron phases of the two introns on both sides of exon  <dig> are identical . schroder et al.  <cit>  have also demonstrated or predicted other minor splice variants for sin <dig> in the human. the  <dig> exons account for only  <dig> % of the gene sequence. it is, of course, unclear how many additional exons and introns are associated with the 5' utr beyond the transcription start site, whose location has not been determined.

currently, the sheep and bovine genome sequences are not available, but it is likely that the sin <dig> gene organization will be similar to that in the human. the current comparative synteny maps between human, sheep and cattle  <cit>  predict that the sin <dig> gene is located on sheep chromosome  <dig>  and bovine chromosome  <dig> , respectively.

a comparative map for all the genes is shown in fig.  <dig>  in fission yeast and insects, the sin <dig> gene consists of a single exon. in worm, fish, rat, mice, and human, sin <dig> has multiple exons. the exon/intron pattern, consisting of  <dig> exons, is observed in all vertebrates, including the two fish species . it is noteworthy that although the genomic sequences of sheep and cattle are not available, the exon/intron pattern of their sin <dig> genes is similar to that of other vertebrates based on the comparison between sheep or cattle sin <dig> cdna and human genomic sequence of sin <dig> . the lengths of these  <dig> exons are also remarkably conserved and fall within the normal range  . as expected, the sizes of the introns differ across species, and some are extremely long. intron sizes generally decrease in the order human > mouse > rat > fish . as expected, intron sizes were quite similar between rodents and human.

the sin <dig> gene from c. elegans is organized quite differently from that in mammals. it consists of  <dig> exons interrupted by nine relatively short introns. the region of the c. elegans gene that contains regions of similarity with the mammalian protein sequences consists of exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> . as noted above and in figure  <dig>  the sin <dig> gene from insects and s. pombe is comprised of only a single exon.

discussion
sin <dig> is a little studied gene product of unclear function found in species ranging from mammals to fungi. although the s. pombe gene product is longer than that of mammals, with an extension at its n-terminus, human sin <dig> can rescue the stress sensitivity noted in the phenotype of a s. pombe strain that expressed a constitutively active form of ras, indicating that function, as well as structure, has been conserved over hundreds of millions of years.

two facts should be considered when attempting to infer a role for sin <dig> in vertebrates. the first, as discussed in the background, is the known ability of type  <dig> ifn to activate mapk/sapk in mammalian cells. the second is the proven involvement of sin <dig> in the yeast sapk  pathway and its involvement in controlling transcription of stress-activated genes  <cit> . the present analysis was conducted in an attempt to gain more detailed information about sin <dig> function from a phylogenetic analysis and comparison of sin <dig> genes and gene products in different taxonomic groups.

the sin <dig> gene is remarkably divergent in both length and sequence identity within the fungi s. pombe, s. cerevisiae, and n. crassa, emphasizing the evolutionary distance between these three species. the regions of similarity are confined to the ~ <dig> amino acid c-terminal regions of the three sequences , and it is this region that is also conserved in insects and vertebrates . this diversity in structure within the fungi is probably reflected in divergence of function. avo <dig>  the apparent sin <dig> ortholog of s. cerevisiae, forms a membrane-associated complex with tor <dig> and other protein components , which control cell growth in response to nutrients  <cit> . cells with deletion of avo <dig> are unable to organize their actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . in contrast, the sin <dig> ortholog of s. pombe is involved in a stress response signaling pathway by interacting with sty <dig>  <cit> . a cross-species comparison of all the sin <dig> sequences available, indicates five regions of greatest conservation, only one of which, a ~ <dig> amino acid central region , was easily defined in all taxa . even this region is poorly conserved in the budding yeast, s. cerevisiae, although certain landmark amino acids are retained . interestingly, sin <dig> from insects and vertebrates, despite having only about 35% identity, are of similar length and possess the five regions of high identity. conceivably, the scd iii domain is functionally essential in all the species, while scds i, ii, iv, and v have evolved conserved function within the metazoa. a not unreasonable assumption is that that sin <dig> plays an evolutionarily conserved role in sapk signaling across a broad range of taxa, including all metazoan and fungal species  <cit>  but has assumed an additional function in vertebrates in mediating crosstalk with the ifn-signal transduction pathway.

in vertebrates sin <dig> falls into a class of highly conserved gene products. its conservation is lower than that of two structural proteins, histone h <dig> and β-actin, but is comparable to that of cdk <dig> . however, while cdk <dig> in yeast and insects retains considerable sequence identity with the vertebrate orthologs, much of the conservation of sin <dig> is lost. it is tempting to speculate that sin <dig> has been subjected to powerful evolutionary constraint that has limited its amino acid sequence divergence within vertebrates. it should be noted that our analyses cannot exclude the possibility that conservation of sin <dig> among vertebrates reflects recent divergence of the sampled vertebrates relative to the other taxa examined. once data become available, it will be instructive to compare sin <dig> gene sequences from the invertebrate chordates  with those of the other metazoan taxa.

values for percentage identities were obtained by aligning amino acid sequences from various species with their human counterparts. cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase. the genbank accession numbers for sequences are as follows. human : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> , sin <dig> . cattle : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> , sin <dig> . mouse : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> , sin <dig> . chicken : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> ; sin <dig> . frog : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> . fly : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> , sin <dig> . yeast : histone h <dig> , β-actin , cdk <dig> , sin <dig> .

sin <dig> was shown to be associated with the cytoplasmic domain of ifnar <dig>  a subunit of the type i ifn receptor  <cit> . since insects appear to lack genes for type i ifn and their receptors , whereas vertebrates utilize this system primarily as an anti-viral response  <cit> , it should be theoretically possible to define a sequence in silico unique to vertebrates but clearly absent in both d. melanogaster and a. gambiae that might account for the association of sin <dig> with ifnar <dig>  sin <dig> binds to the carboxyl end of the cytoplasmic domain of ifnar <dig> via its own carboxyl  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . at least two candidate sequences exist in that part of sin <dig>  one is the rather basic carboxyl terminus , another a hdykhlyfesda  sequence, both of which are absent in the insect proteins . whether these sequences are participants in the interaction of sin <dig> with ifnar <dig> in vertebrates has not been examined experimentally. of course, it is quite possible that insect sin <dig> can bind vertebrate ifnar <dig> or that amino acid substitutions elsewhere in the carboxyl end of the vertebrate sequence have evolved to promote the interaction. these possibilities have also not been tested. in this regard, ifnar <dig>  with which sin <dig> interacts, has evolved much more rapidly than sin <dig> itself. the sequence of human ifnar <dig>  for example, shows only about 58% and 29% identity to those of ovine and chicken ifnar <dig>  respectively  <cit> , while orthologs have yet to be defined for ifnar <dig> in frogs and fish, even though these animals are believed to have a functional ifn system, which includes the production of type i ifn and downstream components in response to double stranded rna  <cit> . interestingly, the only highly conserved continuous sequence of chick and mammalian ifnar <dig> within the sin <dig> binding region is an acidic region  at the very carboxyl terminus of the molecule . it seems possible that this conserved sequence provides the scaffold for sin <dig> binding.

as also observed by schroder et al.  <cit> , sin <dig> is represented by a single gene in all species where it exists. in both insects and the two yeast species, the gene is intronless, while in c. elegans and in vertebrate species introns are present . in budding yeast, only a small number  of genes have introns  <cit> , whereas in most other eukaryotes, including drosophila, intronic sequences are a feature of the majority of genes and must be excised to produce a functional mrna  <cit> . for d. melanogaster, for example, there is an average of  <dig> introns per gene  <cit> . these introns are short, averaging  <dig> bp in drosophila  <cit> . why the sin <dig> genes are intronless in these species is unclear, but there is considerable evidence that retrotransposition occurs in yeast, drosophila  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . in this process, reverse transcription of mrna from a parental gene creates an intronless copy of the parental gene at a new position in the genome. if this mechanism created the sin <dig> gene, a remnant or evolved version of the parental gene might be anticipated to exist, particularly if the transposition event occurred in recent evolutionary time  <cit> . it is unclear whether the intronless sin <dig> gene in drosophila resulted from such a retrotransposition event since there is not a detectable intronic copy elsewhere in the genome. the sin <dig> gene from c. elegans has introns, but is organized very differently from that of vertebrates, where the intron/exon organization is highly conserved .

unfortunately, the function of sin <dig> is unknown. its structural conservation from vertebrates to yeast  <cit>  and its expression in most, if not all tissues of mammals  <cit>  suggest a central, if elusive, role in life processes.

CONCLUSIONS
sapk-interacting protein  <dig> , a little-studied but widely expressed gene product, is encoded by a single gene in fungi, nematodes, insects, and all vertebrates analyzed and shows modest conservation of amino acid sequence that is consistent with some degree of conserved function in stress-activated signal transduction pathways. sin <dig> is highly conserved in vertebrates where it has been implicated in linking interferon responses to the sapk pathway.
