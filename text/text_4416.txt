BACKGROUND
human coronaviruses have a worldwide distribution and are frequently associated with self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease or “the common cold”. they can, however, also present with high morbidity outcomes of the lower respiratory tract including bronchiolitis, pneumonia,  <cit> , asthmatic exacerbations  <cit>  and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> , where human coronavirus oc <dig> has been shown to be the prevalent strain in several regions  <cit> . given the high burden of coronaviruses to human health, and their potential for genetic recombination to give rise to the emergence of completely novel strains, the presence of antiviral strategies is paramount. however, there is currently no commercially available molecular entity which is capable of inhibiting infection with human coronaviruses  <cit> . the 3clpro has been validated as an effective drug target in several studies and has even been termed “the achilles’ heel of coronaviruses”  <cit>  making it an ideal target for the identification of novel lead compounds.

during coronavirus replication the large open reading frame  1a/1ab genes, located at the 5’ end of the genome, are responsible for expressing two large replicase polyproteins . these are co- or post-translationally cleaved by the virally encoded 3clpro and papain-like protease to yield  <dig> non-structural proteins responsible for viral replication  <cit> . the 3clpro is also termed the main protease as it cleaves a total of  <dig> cleavage sites within pp1a and pp1ab  <cit> , in comparison to only three cleavage sites predicted for the papain-like protease  <cit> .

the 3clpro has three distinct domains. domains i and ii are largely composed of several anti-parallel β barrels  <cit>  and is connected to domain iii by a long loop region. domain iii is composed of several globular α-helices and plays a role in protein dimerization, along with the n-terminal n-finger . the active site is located in a chymotrypsin-like fold between domains i and ii and contains a catalytic dyad of his <dig>  which acts as a proton acceptor, and cys144/ <dig>  which undergoes nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate  <cit> . the 3clpro is so named for its close structural and sequence homology to the  <dig> chymotrypsin protease  of rhinoviruses, which contains a catalytic triad composed of his, cys and glu or asp. superimposition of the structures of 3clpro and 3cpro shows that the his and cys of both proteases is almost perfectly aligned, which may explain the similar substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism  <cit> . the position of the glu/asp in 3cpro is, however, replaced by a water molecule in 3clpro, which shares three hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues including the catalytic dyad member his <dig>  it is assumed that this water molecule is responsible for stabilization of the histidine in the intermediate state during enzymatic cleavage  <cit> .

all coronavirus 3clpro share a high sequence homology, as well as main chain architecture and substrate conservation  <cit> . the substrate binding site of the 3clpro has two deeply buried s <dig> and s <dig> subsites, with shallow s1’, s <dig> and s <dig> subsites with varying degrees of solvent exposure. substrate specificity of coronavirus 3clpro is mainly determined by the p <dig>  p <dig> and p1’ positions  <cit> . the p <dig> position has an absolute specificity for glutamine which stabilizes the s <dig> subsite via a hydrogen bond with the imidazole nε <dig> of his162/ <dig> and van der waals interactions with surrounding residues of the s <dig> pocket. the p <dig> site has a preference for leucine or methionine to fill the hydrophobic s <dig> pocket. the sidechains of the s <dig> site are solvent exposed and therefore this site is expected to tolerate a wide range of functionality, but shows a preference for basic residues  <cit> . sidechains and backbones of residues surrounding the s <dig> site create a highly congested pocket which favors a small, hydrophobic residue in the p <dig> position, either ser, thr, val or pro  <cit> . the s1’ and s2’ subsites also accommodate small residues in the p1’ and p2’ positions, which may include ser, ala or gly  <cit> . a typical cleavage recognition site is therefore --leu-glu ↓ , which is conserved among all coronavirus 3clpro  <cit> . theoretically, since these viruses share a highly homologous binding site and substrate conservation, it is reasonable to anticipate that broad spectrum inhibitor strategies might be successful.  <cit> .

a noncovalent, furyl amide ligand, 16r, which was identified by a high throughput screen, with subsequent lead optimization based on structure-activity relationships within the s <dig>  s1’ and s <dig> binding pockets was shown to inhibit the 3clpro of sars-cov at an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  <cit> . this study will detail the generation of a theoretical model of the oc <dig> 3clpro based on a high sequence homology with the solved 3clpro structure of hku <dig> and assess the potential of the inhibitor, 16r, to inhibit this complex in a broad-spectrum manner. this study will therefore provide further evidence to support the identification of broad spectrum 3clpro inhibitors.

RESULTS
homology modelling of the oc <dig> 3clpro
the 3clpro structure of hku <dig>  displayed a high sequence identity of  <dig> % to the 3clpro of oc <dig>  with an e-value of  <dig> . the high degree of identity can be partly expected as both oc <dig> and hku <dig> are human coronaviruses from the betacoronavirus genus. the exceptionally high degree of identity may even further suggest a recent common ancestor, which has yet to be identified. the active site residues are also highly conserved between both sequences indicating that 3d <dig> forms a highly suitable template for model generation .figure  <dig> pairwise sequence alignment of oc <dig> 3clpro with the template structure of 3d <dig>  sequence alignment revealed a high identity of  <dig> %. asterisks indicate conserved residues between target and template. conserved active site residues are highlighted in red. important residues within the oxyanion loop , s <dig> pocket  and s <dig> pocket  are also highlighted to display high degree of conservation within the active site.



homology models were built with modeller   <cit>  where the lowest discrete optimized protein energy  score corresponded to model five with a ga <dig> score of  <dig>  indicating that the model quality corresponded with low resolution crystallographic structures. the dope score profile of target and template  were nearly perfectly overlaid, indicating that the model was close to its native state. a peak in dope score for hku <dig> 3clpro  was observed at approximately residue  <dig>  where oc <dig> 3clpro showed a moderate conservation in dope score. colouring the hku <dig> 3clpro  structure by b-factor indicates the presence of a highly variable loop region from ser <dig> to asp <dig> . the presence of this highly variable loop structure could explain the increase in the dope score profile in this region and may suggest that the homology model has assumed a more stable conformation than the template. structural alignments where the root mean square deviation  is below 2 Å between target and template indicates that the positions of all backbone elements are correct  <cit> . superimposition of the 3d <dig> template and modelled oc <dig> 3clpro structure displayed an rmsd of  <dig>  Å suggesting a highly accurate prediction of the position of all backbone elements . analysis of the overall model quality of target and template by prosa z-score indicated that both fall within an acceptable range for crystallographic structures with a z-score for 3d <dig> of − <dig>  and − <dig>  for the homology model of oc <dig> 3clpro . stereochemical analysis of phi-psi dihedral angles indicated that  <dig> % of residues were in the most favoured regions with none in the disallowed regions .figure  <dig> dope score profiles of template, 3d <dig>  and homology model of oc <dig> 3clpro
. general overlay of profiles indicates the generated model is close to its native structure. the spike at residue  <dig> corresponds to a variable loop structure for which oc <dig> 3clpro has assumed a more stable conformation.



for the latter purposes of this model, in characterization of the inhibitory potential of 16r, it is essential to confirm that the receptor in its active conformation. to ensure the modelled 3clpro of oc <dig> is in its active conformation, several features can be used to differentiate between the active and inactive states. these features include the maintenance of a loop conformation of the loop connecting domain ii and iii and the oxyanion loop. if these features assume an alpha helical conformation it directly or indirectly leads to the collapse of the oxyanion hole and thereby forms an inactive state  <cit> . an alpha helix conformation of residues 186– <dig> in the loop region between domain ii and iii causes a further collapse of the s <dig> and s <dig> subsites  <cit> . the orientation of the his <dig> sidechain in the s <dig> pocket is also vital for substrate binding  <cit> . this residue is largely kept in place by a stacking interaction with the benzene ring of phe <dig> and imidazole ring of his <dig>  <cit> . the orientation of his <dig> is also stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of glu <dig>  this prevents steric interactions between his <dig> and his <dig> allowing it to maintain its orientation in the s <dig> pocket. a hydrogen bond between his <dig> and tyr <dig> has also been implicated in stabilizing the sidechain of his <dig>  <cit> , however we could not observe the formation of this bond in the crystal structure of sars-cov 3clpro , raising the question of its importance to maintain the orientation of his162/ <dig> 

utilising these previously mentioned parameters it is possible to ascertain if the generated homology model of oc <dig> 3clpro is in an active conformation. with the exception of the hydrogen bond between tyr <dig> and his <dig>  which may form in a dynamic system as the tyr <dig> hydroxyl is in close proximity to the imidazole nitrogen of his <dig> but with incorrect geometry to form a hydrogen bond, all other interactions and conformations were maintained indicating that the homology model generated using the 3clpro structure of hku <dig>  as a template is representative of the active conformation of the enzyme . with this and previously mentioned results, indicating the generation of an appropriate homology model of the oc <dig> 3clpro, suggests the generated structure is suitable for further structure-based drug design techniques.figure  <dig> features present in the homology model of oc <dig> 3clpro which represent of an active state of the enzyme.  orientation of his <dig> is essential for substrate binding. this orientation is maintained by stacking interactions with phe <dig> and a hydrogen bond with tyr <dig>  the importance of this bond is questionable as it is not observed in all crystallographic models.  steric interactions between his <dig> and his <dig> disrupt the active conformation of his <dig>  to prevent this, his <dig> is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with glu <dig>   maintenance of loop structures of the oxyanion loop  and the loop connecting domain ii and iii  are essential in stabilizing the oxyanion hole. the general three domain structure of all 3clpro is also depicted.



assessing the binding conformation and free energy of binding of 16r
analysis of the crystallographic structure of the sars-cov 3clpro, with the bound inhibitor 16r, illustrates a pyridine occupying the s <dig> pocket and forming a hydrogen bond with the imidazole nε <dig> of his <dig>  a further two hydrogen bonds are formed between ligand carbonyls and gly <dig> and glu <dig> with three methyl groups inserting into the deep hydrophobic s <dig> pocket  <cit> . the conformation of 16r is almost completely conserved when bound to the 3clpro of oc <dig>  notable exceptions include the shifting of the hydrogen bond formed with gly <dig> to a furan ring oxygen as opposed to the carbonyl oxygen seen in sars-cov 3clpro. the hydrogen bond formed with glu <dig> is also absent in oc <dig> 3clpro, however the distance between the ligand carbonyl and backbone hydrogen is  <dig>  Å and therefore this may be capable of mediating hydrogen bond formation in a dynamic system . free energy of binding between 16r and sars-cov and oc <dig> 3clpro, as assessed by mm-gbsa, is -85 kcal/mol for both receptors. these results suggest that the inhibitor 16r may be capable of inhibiting both complexes.

molecular dynamic simulation of oc <dig> and 16r
to further confirm the findings described in the previous section, and to assess the potential of glu <dig> to form a hydrogen bond in a dynamic system, molecular dynamic simulations were used. molecular dynamics of the sars-cov 3clpro-16r complex are in strong agreement with the crystal data of 3v3m  <cit> . the simulation predicts an average of  <dig>  hydrogen bonds formed over the 10 ns trajectory, with these bonds predominantly forming with glu <dig>  his <dig> and gly <dig>  the bond formed at gly <dig> does however display the potential to form a bifurcated interaction with asn <dig>  as predicted by the previous results, detailed in the section describing the binding conformation, the 3clpro-16r complex of oc <dig> displayed a high occupancy of 100% and 85% at both his <dig> and gly <dig> positions respectively. these results however suggested that the bond formed with gly <dig> was mediated via the furan ring oxygen, where molecular dynamic simulations indicated that this bond was formed between the carbonyl oxygen and gly <dig>  as seen with the crystal structure of sars-cov. molecular dynamics also confirmed that the hydrogen bond at the glu <dig> does not stably form in a dynamic environment and only displays the potential to form at 0-2 ns and 4-5 ns, with an overall occupancy of  <dig> %.

the stability of the bound ligand within the active pocket was also assessed via rmsd, radius of gyration and changes in solvent accessible surface area. a rms deviation below 2 Å is an indication of a ligand which is stably bound to its receptor  <cit> , where an increase in radius of gyration from the starting reference would suggest ligand instability. an increase in solvent accessible surface area of the ligand may indicate the ligand is dissociating into surrounding solvent  <cit> . ligand rmsd within the active site was approximately  <dig>  Å and radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area remained within a stable range of  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  nm <dig> to  <dig>  nm <dig> respectively . these parameters suggest that the ligand is highly stable within the active site.

CONCLUSIONS
the three-dimensional structure of the oc <dig> 3clpro was successfully solved by homology modelling with modeller. analysis of various side chains and loop conformations within and surrounding the substrate-binding site is indicative of an active conformation of the enzyme. the solved structure has been made publicly available in the protein model database  . further analysis of a previously identified lead compound, 16r, suggests that it makes extensive and stable interactions with the 3clpro binding site of oc <dig>  additional analysis of the free energy of binding by mm-gbsa suggests that the ligand binds with the same affinity to the 3clpro of oc <dig> as it does to sars-cov, a receptor it is experimentally proven to inhibit. these results are strongly suggestive that the lead compound, 16r, not only displays the potential to inhibit the 3clpro of sars-cov but also that of the highly homologous oc <dig>  in additional studies  16r was shown to remain stably bound to the 3clpro of 229e and nl <dig> in molecular dynamic simulations and may therefore even display the potential to inhibit the 3clpro of additional coronaviruses. 16r is therefore an excellent lead compound in the pursuit of true broad spectrum inhibitors of all coronaviruses.
