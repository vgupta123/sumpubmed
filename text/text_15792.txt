BACKGROUND
the toxigenic fusarium  and other fungal pathogens contaminate cereal-based foods and feeds by producing a variety of health injurious trichothecene mycotoxins  <cit> . the pathogens deposit multiple mycotoxins in grain during the course of disease development in the crop field and during post-harvest storage  <cit> . importantly, the fungal toxins often enter the food chain  <cit> , and exposures to them through consumption may cause serious mycotoxicosis in humans and animals .

trichothecenes are chemically tricyclic sesquiterpenes, characterized by a double bond at the c <dig>   <dig> position and a c <dig>   <dig> epoxy functional group. the latter is the principal moiety responsible for the toxicity of these fungal secondary metabolites in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . type-a and b are the two types of fungal trichothecenes that often co-contaminate cereals  <cit> . the two types of trichothecenes are separated by the presence of a ketone at position c <dig> in type-b , which is absent in type-a toxins   <cit> . although the toxicities of the members of two trichothecene types vary, exposure to multiple mycotoxins may increase their cytotoxicity because of their synergistic and/or additive cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . common toxicity effects of the trichothecenes in humans and animals include diarrhea, vomiting, feed refusal, growth retardation, immunosuppression, reduced ovarian functions/reproductive disorders and even death  <cit> .

the magnitude of food contamination with trichothecenes is influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors, and the risk can be further increased due to climate change  <cit> . therefore, reduction of the toxins levels in contaminated foods remains a very difficult task  <cit> . physical and chemical processes to remove trichothecenes from foods and feeds are either detrimental, ineffective or prohibitively expensive . however, the use of detoxifying microorganisms to biodegrade mycotoxins, through de-epoxidation or other mechanisms, could be an effective alternative  <cit> . previous studies suggested that the toxicity of don is mainly due to the epoxide moiety, and there is a significant reduction of don toxicity  when it is reduced to produce de-epoxy don  <cit> . these studies further revealed reductions of nivalenol  and t- <dig> toxin toxicities by  <dig> and 400%, respectively, when their de-epoxidized derivatives were tested.

the potential value of microorganisms with trichothecene de-epoxidation activity for improving food/feed quality and safety has led to the identification of bacteria isolated from chicken intestine and rumen fluid, that are able to cleave the epoxide ring of food contaminating trichothecenes under anaerobic conditions and relatively high temperature   <cit> . furthermore, the anaerobic bacterial strain bbsh  <dig>  which can de-epoxidize don, scirpentriol and t- <dig> triol trichothecene mycotoxins, has been used as a feed additive for poultry and swine diets  <cit> . earlier attempts were made to obtain de-epoxidizing aerobic bacteria, but the culture did not retain don/niv de-epoxidation activity after subculturing  <cit> .

in the process of developing effective biotechnological strategies for eliminating trichothecenes from contaminated agricultural commodities, we previously reported an aerobic microbial consortium with a low rate of don de-epoxidation activity, most likely due to the existence of undesired fast growing microorganisms in the culture  <cit> . the present study aimed to increase its de-epoxidation activity through selective enrichment of that culture, and to characterize the enriched culture including its ability to de-epoxidize a variety of fusarium produced trichothecenes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and wide range of temperatures.

dx <dig> was examined for its ability to degrade five type-a trichothecene mycotoxins  and five type-b trichothecene mycotoxins . one hundred and fifty micrograms of each mycotoxin were added to  <dig>  ml nb in 5 ml microcentrifuge tubes , resulting in a 100 μg/ml mycotoxin solutions. each tube was inoculated with 100 μl of an overnight dx <dig> culture, and the cultures in nb + mycotoxin were incubated at  <dig> °c with continuous shaking at 180 rpm, while the negative controls lacked dx <dig>  the percentage of trichothecene transformation to different compounds  by the culture was analyzed  <cit> . five replicate cultures were evaluated for each trichothecene mycotoxin.

effects of don concentration, substrate, temperature, ph, and aeration on microbial de-epoxidation activity
to determine the effects of don concentration on the growth and de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig>  tubes containing 3 ml of nb or msb spiked with low , high  or very high  levels of don were inoculated with dx <dig>  the cultures were grown for 16 h with continuous shaking at 220 rpm and then the cell density was adjusted to  <dig>  od600nm . while incubating the culture at  <dig> °c with shaking at 180 rpm,  <dig>  ml was removed every 12 h and the od600nm was measured. the same volume of microbial culture  was analyzed for de-epoxidation activity by lc-uv-ms technique  <cit> . three replicate cultures for each mycotoxin were tested.

RESULTS
microbial enrichment, functional stability and identification of bacteria in trichothecene transforming bacterial consortium
three months of co-incubating the soil microbes with 200 μg/ml don in msb led to an enriched bacterial consortium dx <dig> that efficiently de-epoxidized trichothecenes, after  <dig> subcultures in broth. the next generation metagenomic sequencing technology determined an altered composition of the bacterial consortium in dx <dig> compared to the original culture that was used for enrichment. the enriched dx <dig> consortium is comprised of different known and unknown bacterial genera, dominated by aerobic stenotrophomonas , followed by anaerobic blautia  and unknown microbes  . in contrast, the initial culture contained a heterogenous community comprised of species of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial genera , and dominated by serratia  <cit> . further bioinformatics analyses elucidated the percentage occurrences of known and unknown bacterial species in dx <dig> . the predominant species was identified to be stenotrophomonas geniculata , followed by s. pavanii , blautia coccoides , s. retroflexus , s. terrae , s. maltophilia  and alkaliphilus crotonatoxidans . noticeably, a significant percentage  of species in dx <dig> was identified to be unknown.fig.  <dig> identification and abundance of bacterial genera and species in trichothecene de-epoxidizing dx <dig> microbial consortium. a: relative abundance of known and unknown bacterial genera in dx <dig>  b: relative abundance of known and unknown bacterial species in dx <dig>  the areas of different color represent abundance of different bacterial genera or species present in dx <dig>  the initials of bacterial species a, b and s indicate genera alkaliphilus, blautia and stenotrophomonas, respectively

aerobic cultures of dx <dig> grown for 72 h in nb + 100 μg/ml ht- <dig> transformed 74% of the mycotoxin to de-epoxy ht- <dig> toxin, and 26% to a de-acetylated derivative . the culture incubated with t2-toxin transformed 46% of the mycotoxin to the de-epoxy t- <dig> product, 16% to an unknown compound and left 38% of the toxin untransformed. in the dx <dig> culture containing diacetoxyscirpenol , 61% and 39% was transformed into de-epoxy das and de-acetylated das, respectively. dx <dig> transformed 55% neosolaniol  to de-epoxy neo and 45% to de-acetylated neo derivatives. the bacterial culture showed capacity to transform t2-triol into two derivatives, namely: 47% de-epoxy t2-triol and 53% de-acetylated t2-triol.fig.  <dig> mass spectrometric evidence of microbial de-epoxidation and de-acetylation of ht- <dig> trichothecene mycotoxin. the upper panel illustrates the mass spectrometer chromatograph of the de-acetylated and de-epoxidized products. the middle and lower panels show the mass spectra of the transformed compounds. arrows on the upper panel indicate the targeted acetyl  and epoxy  functional groups of ht- <dig> toxin. red and blue arrows on the middle and lower panels identify the degradation sites of ht- <dig> toxin. da.ht-2 = de-acetylated ht- <dig>  and de.ht-2 = de-epoxidized ht- <dig> toxin

dx <dig> was also grown under aerobic conditions for 72 h in nb + 100 μg/ml of five type-b trichothecenes, separately. niv was completely transformed into 92% de-epoxy and 8% don products. the culture transformed 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol  into three products, namely: de-epoxy niv , de-epoxy don  and don . dx <dig> was able to transform acetyldeoxynivalenol  into de-epoxy 15-adon  and de-epoxy deoxynivalenol  . most  of verrucarol  was converted to de-epoxy ver, and 95% fusarenonx  was transformed into de-epoxy fus. the remaining 3% ver and 5% fus were not transformed. no spontaneous transformation of trichothecenes in the negative controls was observed.

effects of different growth factors on bacterial de-epoxidation activity
to determine if trichothecene concentration can affect the growth and de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig>  the most common contaminant in food, namely don, was tested. growth of dx <dig> bacteria, aerobically, in msb with  <dig> and 200 μg/ml don was not significantly different from that observed in control cultures without the trichothecene . however, a reduced rate of bacterial growth was determined in msb containing 500 μg/ml don. similarly, increasing the mycotoxin concentration up to 200 μg/ml did not affect bacterial growth in nb medium . bacterial de-epoxidation activity  was lowest in msb + 20 μg/ml don, and highest in msb + 500 μg/ml don containing cultures . the highest rate of de-don formation was  <dig>  μg/h in dx <dig> cultures in msb with 500 μg/ml don between  <dig> to 72 h. all of the mycotoxin was converted in the cultures containing 20 μg/ml between 48–60 h and in the cultures containing 200 μg/ml between 60–72 h. the consortium showed complete de-epoxidation of a high quantity of don  within 96 h. in 200 μg/ml and 500 μg/ml of don, the rate of de-epoxidation increased significantly after 36 h.fig.  <dig> effect of deoxynivalenol concentrations on the growth and de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig> microbial consortium. a: microbial cell density  in msb with different don concentrations measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h. b: microbial cell growth  in nb with different don concentrations, measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 96 h. c: temporal don de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig> in msb containing  <dig>   <dig> and 500 μg/ml don. the relative activity was measured by quantifying de-epoxidation activity divided by microbial growth  at different time points. results are the mean of three replicate observations, and bars shown are ± standard errors of the means. the averages ± standard errors for three treatments and the control are presented in the graph. msb = broth containing six mineral salts +  <dig> % bacto peptone, don = deoxynivalenol, and nb = nutrient broth

growth of dx <dig> in media containing 50 μg/ml don under aerobic conditions at 72 h was three-fold higher in nb and lb than in se and 1/ <dig> nb and did not occur in ms-don . growth in mm, msb and msy was intermediate. over the 72 h, de-epoxidation per cell density was highest in msb and msy and approximately 25% lower in nb and lb and lower by 75% and 87% in 1/ <dig> nb and msc, respectively . no de-epoxidation was observed in mm, ms-don, se and pdb in 72 h. growth of dx <dig> under aerobic conditions for 72 h in msb + 50 μg/ml don was greatest between 25- <dig> °c, but no growth occurred at  <dig> °c . de-epoxidation activity was greatest and equivalent between 20- <dig> °c and lower at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> °c  . growth of the consortium under aerobic conditions for 72 h in msb + 50 μg/ml don was limited to phs near neutral  and the activity was not significantly different between ph  <dig>  to  <dig>   . no de-epoxidation occurred below  <dig>  or above  <dig>  this ph.fig.  <dig> effects of temperature, substrate and ph on growth and de-epoxidation activities of dx <dig> under aerobic conditions. a: od600nm values show relative growth performance of dx <dig> in different broth media. b: bacterial de-epoxidation activity  in different broth media. c: od600nm values demonstrate the effects of temperatures on the growth capacity of dx <dig> in msb. d: bacterial don de-epoxidation in μg/ml under different temperatures in msb. e: od600nm values show growth behavior of dx <dig> at different phs in msb. f: bacterial de-epoxidation  in μg/ml in different phs. the activity was measured by quantifying de-epoxidation activity divided by microbial growth  under different growth conditions. results are the mean of five replicate observations, and bars shown are ± standard errors of the means. the averages of ± standard errors for different growth conditions are presented in the graph. treatments labeled with the same letter are not significantly different, according to tukey’s hsd test . media: nb = nutrient broth, 1/nb = 1/ <dig> strength nb, mm = minimal medium, ms-don = six mineral salts having 200 μg/ml don. de-don = de-epoxy deoxynivalenol, msb = six mineral salts +  <dig> % bacto peptone, msc = six mineral salts broth +  <dig> % bacto peptone, msy = six mineral salts with  <dig> % yeast extract, s.e = standard error, se = soil extract, pdb = potato dextrose broth and lb = luria bertani




energy requirements and localization of bacterial de-epoxidation enzyme
treatment of dx <dig> microbial consortium with the  <dig> % and  <dig> % nan <dig> for 72 h reduced de-epoxidation activity to 5%  and 0%, respectively. in contrast, the control with no nan <dig> added was unable to inhibit de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig>  a cell lysate of dx <dig> transformed 20%  of 50 μg/ml don to de-don within 72 h. in contrast, a cell-free culture filtrate did not show de-epoxidation activity, although the positive control having bacterial cells showed 100% de-epoxidation activity.

discussion
this study reports a highly enriched, stable and effective microbial consortium dx <dig> capable of de-epoxidizing eleven trichothecene mycotoxins under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and broad range of temperatures. since co-applications of multiple microbial strains often have greater beneficial activity  <cit> , the dx <dig> microbial consortium has a great potential to be used as an efficient biodetoxifier of animal feedstuffs contaminated with multiple co-contaminating trichothecene mycotoxins; therefore, improving food/feed quality and safety.

the microbial consortium was found to be comprised of over 30% of unknown bacterial species. this indicates the possibility of novel bacterial involvement in the trichothecenes transformation, and such bacteria appeared to be difficult to isolate using the currently available methods. our attempts, over a period of a few years, failed to produce a stable pure strain with trichothecene de-epoxidation activity. although a don de-epoxidizing aerobic bacterium  was isolated from the same source as the dx <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, the strain did not retain don de-epoxidizing activity after subculturing on agar media. also the bacterium could not be detected in dx <dig>  suggesting that the strain died during enrichment process. isolation of trichothecene de-epoxidizing bacteria through selective enrichment procedures is also challenging because the de-epoxidation reaction involves removal of an oxygen molecule  <cit> , which does not supply any nutrients to bacteria  <cit>  preventing the utilization of trichothecenes as sole carbon or nitrogen sources for selective isolation of de-epoxidizing bacteria from soil samples. this is supported by the present work, which demonstrated that dx <dig> was unable to grow in media containing don as a sole carbon source. previous attempts to obtain aerobic bacteria with de-epoxidation activity were also successful, but the cultures lost their ability to detoxify trichothecenes after subculturing  <cit> . remarkably, dx <dig> consortium which was achieved through prolonged incubation of soil culture with high concentrations of don demonstrated stable activity under aerobic conditions by de-epoxidizing trichothecenes after  <dig> generations in broth medium, and retained its activity when it was tested after two years of preservation at −80 °c.

although trichothecenes are toxic to eukaryotes, prokaryotes appear to be resistant to these fungal secondary metabolites  <cit> . in agreement with those findings the present study demonstrated that dx <dig> grew well in cultures with high concentration of don  and metabolized it completely. taking advantage of this capacity, we were able to increase the population of trichothecene de-epoxidizing bacteria in a culture by prolonged subculturing of soil microbes in media with 200 μg/ml don. this is supported by the observation that a 50-fold dilution of dx <dig> showed de-epoxidation activity, while before the enrichment up to 20-fold dilution of the original culture  was able to de-epoxidize trichothecene. this suggests that during each of twelve seven-day long enrichment steps the de-epoxidizing bacterial cells survived by gaining energy from co-metabolically cleaving the epoxy ring of the trichothecene, while the non-trichothecene metabolizing microbial populations declined by starvation. this explanation is supported by our observation that microbial de-epoxidation in broth mainly occurred at the stationary growth phase, when the bacteria had fewer nutrients, since at this growth stage bacteria increased their de-epoxidation rate when grown with higher concentrations of don . such microbial energy gain from co-metabolic reactions has been reported by chiu and colleagues  <cit> .

treating the dx <dig> culture with  <dig> % nan <dig> completely blocked de-epoxidation activity. nan <dig> inhibits cellular energy production, specifically in gram-negative bacteria, by interfering with catalase/cytochrome c oxidase activity, while gram-positive bacteria are mostly resistant to this energy inhibitor  <cit> . this suggests a possible role for certain gram-negative bacteria in the observed trichothecene de-epoxidation activity  <cit> . although the next generation metagenomics technology identified a low percentage of gram-positive anaerobic bacterial species, namely alkaliphilus crotonatoxidans, bacillus spp., and blautia coccoides, the aerobic species of stenotrophomonas  were found to be the predominant ones present in dx <dig>  it remains unknown if the de-epoxidation of the variety of trichothecenes observed in the present study is the additive activities of a number of individual bacteria and/or the consequences of intra- and interspecific microbial interactions. however, interpretation of the data predicts that certain strains of stenotrophomonas could be the major agents for aerobic de-epoxidation of trichothecenes, and the role of gram-positive bacteria  could attributed to anaerobic de-epoxidation. strains belonging to stenotrophomonas demonstrated efficient biodegradations of fungal toxins and other environmental pollutants  <cit> . these bacteria were not identified as the most abundant ones in our initial soil-derived microbial culture that was enriched to obtain dx <dig>  therefore, the increase of de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig> could be further attributed to the elevation of de-epoxidizing bacterial population during the three-month enrichment process with high concentration don.

among  <dig> trichothecenes tested, dx <dig> efficiently transformed  <dig> to de-epoxy forms and/or don and/or unknown compounds. probably, because of the activity of specific microbial dehydrooxylase niv and 3-adon were transformed to don via removal of a hydroxyl group at the c <dig> position and the acetyl moiety, respectively. however, the reasons for dx100’s inability to subsequently de-epoxidize don in those two assays are obscure.

microbial de-epoxidation in this study occurred in intact and lysed bacterial cells. this implies that the small molecule don entered into bacterial cells and became metabolized there by bacterial cytoplasmic enzymes. this agrees with previous studies that suggested that absorption of trichothecenes by human cells occurred via simple diffusion, and that bacterial cytoplasmic flavoproteins were involved in de-epoxidation of epoxyalkanes  <cit> . the gene and enzymes involved in trichothecene de-epoxidation have not been identified yet, however, the reductive nature of the bacterial trichothecene de-epoxidation reaction and inhibition of de-epoxidation activity by nan <dig> suggests that an active electron transport process is essential and an epoxy reductase is involved in this biological reaction  <cit> .

the functionality of such reductases appeared to be greatly affected by media composition  <cit> . for example, this study showed that decreasing the concentration of bacto peptone in ms  dramatically lowered the bacterial de-epoxidation performance, suggesting that the don de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig> relies on the availability of certain proteins and amino acids. the inhibition of microbial de-epoxidation performance in high sugar containing mm and pdb media suggests the repressive effects of high sugar contents on the de-epoxidation enzymatic activity of dx <dig>  <cit> . therefore, a screening strategy for microbial trichothecene de-epoxidation should use different media and enrichment procedures in parallel, as was done in the initial enrichment process of dx <dig> 

all together, the achievement and characterization of dx <dig> microbial consortium may facilitate the development of an effective technology for biodetoxification of trichothecene contaminated foods and animal feeds. furthermore, the knowledge we have gained from this study would assist in isolating the trichothecene de-epoxidizing genes and enzymes, which could, potentially, also be used to detoxify foods and feeds.

CONCLUSIONS
the capacity of dx <dig> to de-epoxidize several mycotoxins could be an advantage to develop effective strategies for minimizing the synergistic/additive toxic effects of these toxic compounds on consumer health. the de-epoxidation activity of dx <dig> under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and wide range of temperatures as well as its ability to retain activity after many generations and years makes it a unique microbial source. following similar formulation method to mycofix®  dx <dig> can be used as a feed additive  <cit>  as well as the consortium has a potential to be utilized as a biodetoxifier of feedstuffs. such applications of the consortium are pending on positive evaluation of the de-epoxidation performance of dx <dig> on contaminated feedstuffs followed by studying the suitability and safety of the treated materials for feed and food uses. further improvement of de-epoxidation activity under nutrient rich conditions via increasing inoculum size and/or optimizing microbial growth factors could make the consortium an effective feed detoxifier. as an alternative, the trichothecene de-epoxidizing enzymes that might be obtained from dx <dig> through fermentation or a suitable aerobic process could be utilized for treatments of contaminated foods and feeds. furthermore, analyses of meta-transcriptomes of active and inactive dx <dig> consortium could lead to the identification of novel genes responsible for aerobic de-epoxidation of trichothecenes. since the fungal toxins enhance disease severity in grain  <cit> , transfer and constitutive expression of the identified novel gene into cereal genomes could generate cultivars resistant to fusarium pathogens and their toxins. such achievements not only improve yields and quality of grain but also minimize the exposure of humans and animals to these health hazardous fungal toxins while protecting the environment by reducing the applications of toxic chemicals in the environment for controlling trichothecene producing fungal pathogens.
