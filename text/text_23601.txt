BACKGROUND
small rnas, micrornas  and short interfering rnas  are important gene-regulatory molecules at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . plant mirnas are derived from single rna molecules. primary rna precursors  can form imperfect stem-loop structures where a mirna/mirna* duplex is processed from the stem by dicer-like  <dig>  or dcl <dig>  <cit> . plant mirnas negatively regulate their cognate mrnas by fully or partly binding to complementary sites. after being methylated at the 3′ end by hua enhancer  <dig>   <cit> , the mature mirna with a length of 20– <dig> nucleotides  is loaded onto the rna-induced silencing complex  to direct the cleavage of its mrna targets based on extensive complementarity. plant mirnas predominantly modulate their targets by mrna cleavage, and some classes of  <dig> nt mirnas direct cytosine dna methylation at target genes to regulate their expression  <cit> . more recently, mirna regulation of gene expression via dna methylation and chromatin modification has been suggested  <cit> . the nearly perfect complementarity between mirnas and their target sites makes it possible to predict their targets by computational approaches. mirnas were shown to regulate genes involved in basic developmental processes, such as leaf development, flowering time, organ polarity and auxin signaling  <cit> , as well as stress responses and disease resistance  <cit> .

high-throughput sequencing technologies allow the discovery of a large set of diverse plant mirnas. thousands of mirnas have been identified in different plant species, rapidly enlarging the identified plant mirna pool, including mirnas from different tissues or developmental stages. based on the recent version of mirbase , over  <dig> mirnas have been identified in rice. among them,  <dig> mirna families are evolutionarily conserved between arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . some of the mirnas are conserved only among closely related monocots, suggesting the emergence of novel mirnas after divergence of monocots and dicots  <cit> .

as one of the most important food sources for the world’s population, rice is also an ideal model plant representing cereal crops. the grain-filling phase is a major stage of plant development that largely determines yield and quality  <cit> . during this process, all resources of the plant contribute toward a steady rate of starch accumulation in the storage units of rice grains  <cit> . in general, the grain development process can be divided into early development and filling phases. the former is characterized by high biosynthetic activity in grain formation when the total dry matter starts to increase and endosperm starch begins to accumulate rapidly in the seed , whereas during the latter phase  the grain usually exhibits a slower increase in dry weight until maximum values are reached and grain weight becomes constant. global gene expression profiling studies of mrnas have shown that many genes in multiple pathways participate in grain filling processes, such as those involved in nutrient synthesis, starch synthesis and transport  <cit> .

on the other hand, mirnas were identified as preferentially expressed in various rice organs, including leaf, root, panicle and stem, as well as in seedlings under various stress treatments  <cit> . a number of studies were also carried out on small rnas in the grains of japonica varieties  <cit> . some mirnas were preferentially expressed in early developing rice grains, such as 1– <dig> daf and 3– <dig> daf  <cit> , suggesting regulatory roles of mirnas during grain development. these studies, mainly in subspecies of japonica, also identified significant numbers of both conserved and non-conserved mirnas. we report here the generation and sequencing of a small rna library from grain tissues sampled during the entire grain filling stage of an indica cultivar. in addition to numerous conserved mirnas, we identified  <dig> novel mirnas. subsequently, a customized mirna chip was generated and mirna expression profiling was studied using rna samples from grains of each of the three filling stages: viz. milk-ripe , soft-dough , and hard-dough . our results showed that most of the widely conserved mirnas were down-regulated during grain develop-ment whereas rice or grass-specific mirnas were up-regulated. the targets of differentially expressed mirnas appeared to be involved in multiple biological processes, such as carbohydrate metabolism, hormone signaling and pathways associated with seed maturity, suggesting that rice mirnas may play important roles during grain development.

RESULTS
small rna populations at the grain filling stage
we measured the fresh and dry grain weights of rice cultivar, baifeng b, an indica landrace, at several stages of grain-filling . the fresh weights began to increase from  <dig> daf; dry matter accumulation became faster from  <dig> daf and reached highest levels at about  <dig> daf . morphological observations of developing rice seeds showed that the filling phase can be divided into three continuous filling stages. for illumina sequencing, we isolated small rnas from immature rice grains sampled at  <dig> daf to  <dig> daf. after removing low-quality reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained with  <dig>  unique sequences. about  <dig>  distinct reads  were aligned to the ‘9311’ genome using short oligonucleotide alignment program   <cit>  . among them,  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt small rnas form the two largest groups, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of raw reads, respectively . by comparison with mirnas from mirbase v <dig> ,  <dig> known mirnas  were found in our dataset. all of these mirnas, except for mir <dig>  were members of  <dig> families that are conserved in diverse plant species . the abundance of mirnas varied greatly. mirna families highly conserved across plant species, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were sequenced more than  <dig>  times, whereas previously known stress-induced members, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were detected less than  <dig> times , indicating that tissue-specific expression patterns of mirnas are related to their functions. in contrast, most rice- or monocot-specific mirnas were detected with low read numbers, except for mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which were represented by  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies, respectively.

there were significant variations in expression levels for members of the same family. for example, the abundance of the mir <dig> family varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>   reads. similarly, the abundance of members of the mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  families were also highly variable . twenty previously reported non-conserved mirna families were not detected in our dataset. a major reason for this might be the limited low sequencing depth, at which the expression level of this group of mirnas might have been too low to be detected in our library. another factor may have been the different subspecies and cultivar used compared with previous work. we found that the locations of many mirna reads varied within a ± <dig> nt range from the 5′ or 3′ ends of annotated mirna sequences. some of these variants even had similar reads compared with those annotated in mirbase. for example, the annotated mir <dig> had  <dig> reads in our libraries, whereas the other  <dig> nt variants had  <dig> reads. interestingly, some mirna*s had higher read numbers than the corresponding mirnas. for example, mir529* and mir2124* had more reads than their respective mirnas,  <dig> vs  <dig> and  <dig> vs  <dig>  respectively, suggesting that mirna* may play a major role in these cases .

identification of  <dig> novel mirnas in developing caryopses
to find novel mirnas, we first mapped all the small rnas to the sequenced indica cultivar “9311” genome because baifeng b is an indica landrace. secondary structures of sequences around the small rnas were produced using mfold. these putative mirna precursors were then used to find mirna*s, which are considered strong evidence for dcl1-derived products  <cit> . we found  <dig> regions that satisfied these criteria and considered them to be novel mirna gene candidates . most novel mirnas showed weak expression levels . the reads for their mirna*s were even lower. all of these newly identified mirnas appeared to be rice-specific and had not been reported in other species. most novel mirnas were not detectable by northern blotting, except can_mir  <dig> , but all were confirmed by using more sensitive array analysis . surprisingly, novel mirnas discovered in previous deep sequencing of rice grain small rnas were rarely present in our dataset. among  <dig> novel mirnas in the 1– <dig> daf rice grain library  <cit> , and another  <dig> reported by xue et al.  <cit>  in a 3– <dig> daf rice grain library, only nine were detected in our library. these included mir1862d and mir1862e with relatively abundant expression levels of  <dig> and  <dig> reads, respectively, whereas the others  were detected with expression levels of only one to five reads . the lack of shared novel mirnas could be: 1) due to our using indica cultivar baifeng b whereas all previous studies were with subspecies japonica; 2) because the majority of the rice-specific mirnas are expressed at very low levels, they might not have been detected at our sequencing depth.

targets of novel mirnas were predicted and some appeared to be involved in the grain filling process . for example, can_mir_ <dig> was predicted to target starch synthase ii, which is preferentially expressed in the endosperm at the middle to later stages of grain filling and plays an important role in elon-gation of α- <dig>  amylase chains  <cit> . can_mir_ <dig> and can_mir_ <dig> may target a ubiquitin-protein ligase gene and a carboxylate oxidase gene, which are known to be involved in cell death and fruit ripening progress  <cit> , respectively. one target of can_mir_ <dig> is the growth-regulating factor gene , which is also targeted by mir <dig>  <cit> , indicating that multiple mirnas may regulate the same gene family.

mirna profile changes during grain filling
to study the expression patterns of mirnas during grain development, we generated mirna chips containing  <dig> probes, and comprising  <dig> known mirnas from mirbase version  <dig> , the  <dig> newly identified candidates, and  <dig> controls. small rnas isolated from grains at the milk-ripe stage , the soft-dough stage , and the hard-dough stage  were hybridized to the mirna chips. the raw signal values are provided in additional file  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas were detected above background levels  in g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig>  respectively. among them,  <dig> mirnas were expressed in all three filling stages, whereas  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were specifically expressed in g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig>  respectively. most of the phase-specific mirnas were newly identified, such as can mir_ <dig>  which is expressed at g <dig> and g <dig>  can_mir <dig> and can_mir <dig>  which are expressed at g <dig> and g <dig>  and can_mir <dig> and can_mir11*, which are detected only at g <dig> .

using a relative intensity change of 2-fold or above between consecutive filling stages, the expression patterns of mirnas were clustered . as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> mirna families included  <dig> members that were differentially expressed across the three filling stages. nine members of seven mirna families were up-regulated. the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> increased from g <dig> to g <dig>  but remained largely unchanged from g <dig> to g <dig>  whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> underwent rapid increases from g <dig> to g <dig>  in contrast, nine members of six mirna families were down-regulated. among them, the expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> declined rapidly from g <dig> to g <dig>  whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> gradually declined with advancing grain filling. the expression of mir <dig> also declined rapidly from g <dig> to g <dig>  some of these expression patterns were consistent with results from northern blot assays. it seems that conserved mirnas were mostly down-regulated whereas rice- or grass-specific mirnas were up-regulated during the course of grain filling. as shown in figure 2b, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly up-regulated, whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were down-regulated. the expression of mir <dig> could not be confirmed probably because its expression level was too low.

*: the probe sequence is on the same precursor of this mirna, but had a ± <dig> nt range from the annotated mirna sequence.

a: p-value <  <dig> .

b: mean levels averaged from three biological replicates; fold changes in mirna levels were compared from the milky  to hard dough  stages and selected as less than  <dig>  or more than  <dig>  .

c: signal values < <dig>  were not considered for variance analysis.

mirna-mediated target mrna cleavage and target expression patterns during grain filling
to further study the potential effects of differentially expressed mirnas during grain filling, we computationally predicted their targets using the miru program. rapid amplification of 5′ cdna ends  was used to validate the cleavage events. as shown in additional file 7a, most targets of conserved rice mirnas, such as targets of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were annotated to be similar to those from other studies. however, the mir <dig> target os04g <dig>  a udp-glucuronosyl transferase protein, was not previously reported. cleavage of os04g <dig> and os03g <dig> occurred with higher frequencies at the 9th and 12th positions of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, in all  <dig> sequenced clones. this is in contrast to the commonly observed 10th or 11th position of mirnas, such as the cleavage sites of mir444b. <dig> on os04g <dig>  and mir <dig> on os04g <dig> and os04g <dig>  we also observed a putative target, os10g <dig>  for the novel mirna candidate can_mir_ <dig>  where only three of  <dig> sequenced clones had cleavage sites at the sixth position; the other degraded fragments were not located on the targeted sequence at all .

finally, quantitative real time-pcr  was used to examine the correlation of the expression patterns of mirnas and their targets. most of the mirnas were negatively associated with their targets . as shown in table  <dig>  a large number of targets of differentially expressed mirnas during grain filling were transcription factors . based on their biological functions in rice or other species, the predicted target genes appear to be involved in various bio-logical processes. for example, mir <dig> regulates a myb gene, which is considered a positive regulator of the ga response during grain maturation  <cit> . the targets of mir <dig>  os04g <dig> and os04g <dig>  are auxin-responsive factors , which are important components of auxin signal transduction  <cit> . mir <dig> targeted a type of mads-box transcription factor that is similar to an arabidopsis homolog that has roles in fruit dehiscence  <cit> . moreover, transcription factors, such as nac domain proteins, growth factors, and the scarecrow gene regulator, have been observed in other cellular growth developmental processes. differential expression of mirnas and their target genes seem to form a complicated regulatory network that plays a critical role during grain filling in rice.

discussion
using high throughput sequencing and customized mirna chips, we analyzed small rnas in developing rice grains from the milky to hard dough stages. the analysis revealed dynamic features of the regulatory network mediated by mirnas during rice grain development.

small rna population and novel mirnas involved in developing grains
we obtained nearly  <dig> million high quality small rnas from grain samples collected from  <dig> to  <dig> daf. a significant proportion of the small rnas were  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt in length. in plants, 21-nt mirnas and trans-acting sirnas have roles in post-transcriptional gene silencing by directing mrna degradation or translational repression  <cit> , whereas 24-nt sirnas tend to be involved in dna and histone modifications that lead to transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . recently, 24-nt mirnas were also found to direct dna methylation  <cit> . in our sequencing data, the reads of 24-nt small rnas were nearly 7-fold more frequent than reads for 21-nt small rnas . the presence of a large population of small rnas in developing rice grains suggests they have important roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in grain development.

although a number of studies of small rnas have been carried out using grains from various developmental stages and from various rice accessions, novel mirnas involved in this process have been continuously discovered  <cit> . we sequenced small rna pools from the developing caryopsis of the indica landrace, baifeng b, at different stages of development and revealed many classes of conserved mirnas as well as novel ones. the discovery of  <dig> novel mirna candidates was supported by detection of corresponding mirna*s that were consistent with recent mirna criteria for characterization  <cit> . no homologous members were reported in other species, indicating that they are probably rice-specific and found only with extensive tissue sampling.

mirnas have dynamic expression patterns in developing grains
many mirnas display temporal or tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> . our sequencing results revealed that more than  <dig> known rice mirnas were expressed in the rice grain. several, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were expressed at high levels, indicating that, as they are highly expressed in other tissues such as leaf and root, these conserved mirnas are possibly important regulators for rice plant development.

our chip data showed that known and novel mirnas were expressed differentially during the grain filling process. approximately half of the conserved mirnas detected were up-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> daf, whereas approximately half were down-regulated. compared with previous reports  <cit> , the expression levels of most mirnas were approximately the same or up-regulated during the periods 1– <dig> and 6– <dig> daf. some mirna genes, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  displayed continually high expression levels throughout grain filling. in contrast, the expression levels of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were down-regulated at the late phase after being up-regulated during early development . previous work on gene expression showed that in the early development phase  grain metabolic pathways tend to involve embryo differentiation and cell enlargement  <cit> . this pattern changes at the soft-dough stage  and during the late filling phase when grains begin to lose moisture and metabolism switches to senescence and dormancy, processes that might be associated with down-regulated patterns of some mirnas.

a complex regulatory network in rice grain development
our results showed that differentially expressed mirnas seem to regulate large numbers of genes, including many transcription factor genes. in previous microarray analyses, a group of transcription factor genes identified to be involved in the transcriptional control of grain filling included a zip type transcription factor that was highly expressed in aleurone and endosperm, and certain myb genes that may be important in regulating gene expression in developing rice grains  <cit> . on the other hand, nac domain protein genes regulated by mir <dig> were implicated in regulating metal mobilization from leaves to seed  <cit> , as well as grain senescence and nutrient remobilization  <cit> , while mads box transcript genes, the targets of mir <dig>  were considered necessary for fruit ripening in tomato and embryo development in arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition, hormonal accumulation and other changes in seeds were shown to affect nitrogen supply and drought tolerance during grain filling  <cit> ; for example, mir <dig> targets arfs that can bind auxin-response elements to regulate expression of other genes  <cit> . novel mirnas are often expressed at low levels and match their targets with imperfect pairing. we propose that novel mirnas may be involved in rice grain development by targeting starch synthesis genes that control the accumulation of starch. although we were unable to identify the exact cleavage sites on the targets, these novel mirnas probably regulate their targets by translational inhibition. in light of their important functions in the regulatory network of grain development, future work on these mirnas and their targets is required.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides the first small rna expression analysis throughout the entire grain filling phase in an indica rice cultivar. our small rna sequencing and chip analysis enlarged the rice mirna repertoire and confirmed the existence of most conserved, and nearly half of the non-conserved, rice mirnas in developing grains. comparison between the three phases of grain filling revealed that these mirnas and their targets may be involved in diverse pathways, which may also be conserved in other cereal plants.
