BACKGROUND
a widely held view in ageing research is that the rate of ageing is influenced by the division of resources between growth rate and reproduction on one hand, and somatic maintenance on the other  <cit> . this theory proposes that evolution sets the level of somatic maintenance to be just sufficient to prevent damage that would interfere with growth and reproduction but not waste energy that could be otherwise used to produce offspring or increase the rate of development. thus, rather than being an active programme, ageing results from the eventual failure of the somatic maintenance set by this balance. however, the balance of resources between somatic maintenance and reproduction must also be responsive to the environment because external conditions affect growth and development and can vary considerably. understanding this plasticity may help us understand how ageing is regulated and is subject to external interventions.

in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, the foxo transcription factor daf- <dig> plays a major role in mediating changes in resource allocation in response to environmental change. firstly, daf- <dig> is required for entry into the diapausal  dauer stage under conditions of starvation and overcrowding  <cit> . formation of this stress-resistant alternative to the normal third larval stage  involves several morphogenetic and metabolic changes and upregulation of somatic maintenance genes. dauer larvae can survive for several months until they find food, upon which they resume normal development into adults that have a normal lifespan  <cit> .

secondly, outside its role in dauer formation, daf- <dig> activity is associated with increased stress resistance and survival and reduced reproductive fitness  <cit> . most studies of daf- <dig> have focussed on its role in mediating the phenotypes of mutants of the c. elegans insulin/igf like signalling  pathway. activation of this pathway leads to the translocation of daf- <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. when this pathway is disrupted by mutations such as reduction-of-function mutants of the daf- <dig> insulin-like receptor or the age- <dig> class ia phosphoinositide 3-kinase , the propensity to form dauers, stress resistance and adult lifespan are all increased as a result of daf- <dig> activation  <cit> . studying gene expression in these mutants has led to the identification of many genes upregulated by daf- <dig>  <cit> . these genes are involved in several processes that may increase lifespan, including those clearly involved in somatic maintenance such as heat shock proteins and antioxidant proteins. consistent with the cost of daf- <dig> activation, long-lived daf- <dig> animals show reduced fertility and cannot compete with the wild type  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression of daf- <dig> using transgenes slows development  <cit>  and daf- <dig> reduction of function by rnai or mutation causes worms to reach reproductive adulthood slightly before wild type animals , suggesting that even in the wild type, daf- <dig> acts to slow development.

in contrast to daf- <dig> mutants, the long-lived age- <dig> mutant is able to compete with the wild type over several generations when the two strains are mixed under standard culture conditions  <cit> . however, the age- <dig> mutant loses the ability to compete with the wild type if the mixed population is exposed to repeated cycles of starvation and feeding  <cit> . these competition experiments are very sensitive to small changes in fitness and suggest that the age- <dig> mutation does not cause constitutive activation of daf- <dig> but interferes with the ability of the worm to adapt to changing conditions. in agreement with this conclusion, a study of daf- <dig> localisation reported no effect of the age- <dig> mutation under normal culture conditions  <cit> . age- <dig> is a reduction-of-function mutant rather than a null mutation and its molecular nature is unknown  <cit> . interestingly, only with age do age- <dig> mutants become resistant to hydrogen peroxide and show elevated levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase activities  <cit> . in summary, the age- <dig> mutation appears to affect the animal only during starvation and in ageing adults, so understanding how age- <dig> regulates daf- <dig> during these conditions may reveal how this mutation causes increased longevity.

in this study, we focus on the starvation-induced first larval stage  diapause . like the dauer stage, the l <dig> diapause allows c. elegans to survive periods of long-term starvation. starved l1s survive several weeks and time in this condition has no effect on subsequent adult lifespan  <cit> . however, unlike the dauer diapause, there are no obvious morphological changes in the starved l <dig> that might protect the larvae from external stresses. we investigated how l <dig> larvae respond to oxidative stress and have shown that starvation induces resistance to h2o <dig> in a daf-16-dependent manner. consistent with these results, daf- <dig> was localised in cell nuclei after short-term starvation. however, after long-term starvation, daf-16a::gfp translocated to the cytoplasm and this translocation was absent in the age- <dig> mutant. we show that a similar effect occurs in old worms as they become starved with age. these data suggest a novel mechanism underlying longevity in weak age- <dig> mutants and reveals an unexpected negative regulation of foxo transcription by class ia pi3ks in response to starvation.

RESULTS
to investigate the function and regulation of daf- <dig> under conditions in which c. elegans encounter starvation, we turned to the l <dig> diapause. this diapause state is entered once larvae hatch from their eggshells in the absence of food. these larvae arrest in development and are viable without food for weeks, re-entering normal development when food is encountered. unlike the dauer diapause, the l <dig> diapause can be entered  by mutants lacking functional daf- <dig>  this property makes the l <dig> diapause a physiologically relevant model for studying daf- <dig> function and regulation in response to starvation and other stresses.

most studies of daf- <dig> function have been carried out in the context of its role in the stress-resistance and extend lifespan of iis mutants. under standard growth conditions, mutation of daf- <dig> alone only slightly increases susceptibility to stress  <cit> . however, in this study we find that in the l <dig> diapause, mutation of daf- <dig> has a dramatic effect on the response of larvae to an acute treatment of hydrogen peroxide. for these experiments, we isolated l1s hatched in the absence of food in an aqueous phosphate buffer and exposed them to a range of concentrations of h2o <dig> for  <dig> minutes . we then washed away the h2o <dig> and transferred the worms to agar plates containing bacterial food to reinitiate development and assess the long-term effects. the short-term effect of the treatment was to inhibit movement, but the major long-term effect was to cause an abnormal developmental arrest. for example, wild type larvae assessed two days after a treatment of  <dig> mm h2o <dig> remained permanently at a size corresponding to l <dig> or l <dig> stage and displayed very sluggish, uncoordinated movement. starved l1s with loss-of-function mutations in daf- <dig> were very sensitive to h2o <dig> treatment:  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> caused over 80% permanent arrest of daf- <dig> or daf- <dig> mutants compared to no permanent arrest for the wild type . the h2o <dig> sensitivity of daf- <dig> mutants was fully rescued by a transgene expressing a daf-16a::gfp fusion protein  <cit>  , confirming the role of daf- <dig> in conferring h2o <dig> resistance.

to investigate the role of starvation, we tested the h2o <dig> resistance of l1s hatched in the presence of food on agar plates. in contrast to starved larvae, these fed larvae showed high sensitivity to  <dig>  mm h2o <dig>  and it made little difference whether fed l1s were mutant for daf- <dig> or not . these results demonstrate that daf-16-dependent protection of larvae from h2o <dig> depends on environmental conditions and is consistent with the hypothesis that daf- <dig> is only activated when its transcriptional targets are needed for survival.

mutation of the age- <dig> pi3k/akt pathway affects daf- <dig> activity in dauer formation and lifespan. to test whether mutation of this pathway regulates the ability of daf- <dig> to protect starved l1s against h2o <dig>  we quantified the resistance of mutants in the pathway using the assay described above. in order to assess how conditions and genotype affect h2o <dig> resistance, we used h2o <dig> concentrations that resulted in developmental arrest of a quantifiable proportion of the test population. for example, after treatment with  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> approximately 30% of wild type larvae were permanently arrested at the l2/l <dig> stage, 20% were unaffected  and approximately 50% were temporarily delayed in development because they reached adulthood approximately one day later than did untreated controls.

under these conditions, l1s with age- <dig> mutation showed increased resistance to h2o <dig> . we next tested a gain-of-function mutation in the downstream kinase akt- <dig>  <cit>  and a reduction-of-function mutation in daf- <dig>  <cit> , the pip <dig> 3-phosphatase pten. these mutations activate the age- <dig> pathway and, in comparison to the wild type, they caused starved l1s to be more sensitive to h2o <dig> . we also used a lower concentration of h2o <dig>  to differentiate these hypersensitive mutants further . thus, mutation of the age- <dig> pathway affects the ability of daf- <dig> to protect worms from h2o <dig> 

although useful for identifying genes involved in a process, genetic analysis such as described above does not provide information on where, when or how genes are acting. to try to answer some of these questions, we investigated the subcellular localisation of daf- <dig> because control of the presence of foxo in the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor, is thought to be a major mechanism of its regulation. daf- <dig> has been shown to translocate to the cell nucleus in response to heat stress, certain oxidative stresses and starvation  <cit> . to investigate how starvation and oxidative stress influence daf- <dig> activity in our system, we examined daf- <dig> localisation in l <dig> larvae, using a strain previously characterised in a study by lin et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . this strain contained the transgene muis <dig>  an integrated daf-16a::gfp construct that rescues daf- <dig> activity. in l1s hatched in the presence of food, we found that, as previously reported, daf-16a::gfp was located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm  <cit>  . however, in over 70% of l1s hatched in liquid culture and starved for one day, daf-16a::gfp was localised solely to the nucleus . this result is consistent with the idea that localisation of daf- <dig> in the nucleus is the mechanism by which starvation confers oxidative stress resistance.

however, in l1s starved for two days or more, we found that daf-16a::gfp translocates back to the cytoplasm and was distinctly excluded from the nucleus in over 70% of larvae . this translocation of the daf- <dig> transcription factor to the cytoplasm upon long-term starvation might be expected to lead to a decrease in the transcription of target genes and therefore an increased sensitivity to h2o2-induced arrest. however, when we tested this hypothesis using the h2o <dig> resistance assay described above, we found that after three days of starvation larvae displayed levels of resistance similar to if not greater than those of larvae starved for one day . this resistance was still dependent on daf- <dig> activity because daf- <dig> mutants were still hypersensitive to h2o <dig> after three days . these results suggest that even though daf- <dig> translocates to the cytoplasm upon prolonged starvation, sufficient daf- <dig> dependent transcription and translation of somatic maintenance genes has already occurred to provide long-term stress resistance. thus, one possibility is that translocation to the cytoplasm after long term starvation prevents excess expenditure of resources on somatic maintenance processes.

a likely mechanism for the translocation of daf- <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is the activation of the age- <dig> pathway. to test this possibility, we examined daf-16a::gfp in starved l1s with the age- <dig> mutation. in these larvae daf-16a::gfp remained in the nucleus, both on day one and during subsequent days of starvation . continuous localisation of daf- <dig> to the nucleus in the age- <dig> mutants may increase allocation of resources to stress resistance. this increased expenditure might explain why this mutant is unable to compete with the wild type during cycles of feeding and starvation  <cit> . the age- <dig> dependent daf- <dig> translocation we have discovered also suggests that long-term starvation activates age- <dig>  which is a surprising conclusion considering current models proposing that class ia pi3ks are downstream targets of insulin-induced signalling in response to feeding. recently a starvation-dependent, pi3k-dependent gene target has been identified in a human cancer cell line  <cit> . one possibility is that long-term starvation relieves a nutrition-induced feedback mechanism that downregulates pi3k signalling in mammalian cells  <cit> .

age-1-dependent daf- <dig> translocation in response to prolonged starvation might be a consequence of endocrine stimulation or might occur through the upregulation of a cellular signal. one candidate for such a signal is h2o <dig> itself, which has been shown to act as an intracellular second messenger. this molecule can activate the pi3k/akt pathway to cause foxo3a to translocate to the cytoplasm of mammalian cells  <cit> . to explore whether this response was conserved in c. elegans, we treated larvae starved for one day with increasing concentrations of h2o <dig>  we found that h2o <dig>  like long-term starvation, caused daf-16a::gfp to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . in a previous study, oxidative stress in the form of the superoxide producer juglone had been shown to cause daf- <dig> to translocate to nucleus in fed l <dig> larvae  <cit> . we found that, in l1s starved for one day, neither juglone nor paraquat, another superoxide producer, had any significant effect on daf-16a::gfp localisation , possibly because daf- <dig> is already mainly nuclear in these larvae. thus, h2o <dig> has a different effect from superoxide producers on daf- <dig> localisation.

importantly, h2o2-induced translocation of daf-16a::gfp was ablated in the age- <dig> mutant , suggesting that age- <dig> mediates daf- <dig> translocation to the cytoplasm upon h2o <dig> treatment. to test the involvement of age- <dig> further, we developed techniques to determine whether phosphatidylinositol  trisphosphate , the lipid product of age- <dig>  is actually produced in c. elegans in response to h2o <dig>  we found that, as in mammals, h2o <dig> did indeed stimulate pip <dig> production in starved c. elegans l1s . no pip <dig> was produced in age- <dig> null mutants that were made viable by the daf- <dig> loss-of-function mutation, demonstrating that pip <dig> generation requires the age- <dig> class ia pi3k. next, we tested the long-lived age- <dig> mutant for pip <dig> production. despite the uncertainty about the molecular nature of this mutant, we found that no detectable pip <dig> was produced in age- <dig> larvae after h2o <dig> stimulation . thus, in starved l1s, the hx <dig> mutation blocks the ability of the age- <dig> class ia pi3k to produce pip <dig> in response to h2o <dig> 

although it is technically difficult to test whether h2o <dig> is the endogenous signal that causes daf- <dig> translocation to the cytoplasm after prolonged starvation, there have been several studies that make it a good candidate. reactive oxygen species have been shown to increase upon serum or glucose starvation  <cit> . h2o <dig> can stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase signalling through its inhibitory effect on receptor tyrosine phosphatases. in addition, h2o <dig> can inhibit pten activity  <cit> , stimulate the association of mammalian class ia pi3ks with ras  <cit>  and activate type i pip kinase dependent ptdinsp2-5-kinase activity  <cit> . all the above mechanisms could lead to h2o2-induced pip <dig> synthesis. alternatively there could be a direct upregulation of iis signalling in response to daf- <dig> activation. a number of potential insulin-like ligands are upregulated in daf- <dig> mutants  <cit>  and a recent study demonstrated that the drosophila insulin receptor homologue was dramatically upregulated in flies overexpressing activated dfoxo  <cit> .

as worms age, their pharyngeal pumping rate slowly reduces to zero  <cit> . we wondered whether this reduction of food intake causes long-term starvation and therefore investigated whether daf- <dig> translocates to the cytoplasm of cells in old adult worms. the data published by henderson and johnson using a daf-16::gfp fusion transgene suggest that in adults under standard laboratory conditions without starvation, the nuclear localisation of daf- <dig> is not sufficient to discern nuclei. however, in the strain used in their study, daf-16::gfp is expressed at noticeably higher levels than the strains used in this study, and they recently been reported that their transgene contains a missense mutation in the daf- <dig> sequence  <cit> . consistent with the initial description of the transgenes used in our study  <cit> , we found that in reproductively active three day old adults raised at 20°c, daf- <dig> was localised to both the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells with nuclei visible as distinct spots .

however, as worms aged we found that nuclei became progressively less distinct, indicating a translocation to the cytoplasm . in three day old worms carrying the age- <dig> mutation, daf- <dig> localisation was similar to that seen in wild type worms of the same age, although nuclei were slightly more distinct than seen in the wild type . however, in older age- <dig> mutants, daf- <dig> became more nuclear and there was no translocation to the cytoplasm. even in very old worms that were close to death as assessed by age, movement and appearance, cell nuclei were visible as distinct spots of gfp . thus, there is an age-1-dependent translocation of daf- <dig> to the cytoplasm in old worms. the lack of this age-dependent translocation in age- <dig> mutants may result in increased daf- <dig> activity and hence explain the increased resistance to h2o <dig> and antioxidant activities observed in these mutants as they age  <cit> .

mice lacking the adaptor protein p66shc, which binds to receptor tyrosine kinases, have an extended lifespan  <cit> . interestingly, in cells derived from these mice, there is a defect in h2o2-induced translocation of foxo3a to the cytoplasm  <cit> . we have demonstrated a physiological whole-organism situation in which a foxo transcription factor translocates to the cytoplasm and shown that this response is defective in worms carrying the age- <dig> mutation, which has a strong effect on daf- <dig> localisation only after prolonged starvation or ageing. like this mutant, the p66shc mutant mouse has increased stress resistance without obvious deleterious effects  <cit> . we propose a model whereby in these mutants, an evolutionarily-conserved response to prolonged starvation is traded for increased longevity.

CONCLUSIONS

daf-16/foxo is nuclear-localised and active in the starved l <dig> diapause to enhance stress resistance but translocates back to the cytoplasm after long-term starvation in a manner dependent on age-1/pi3k . we propose this response is a negative feedback mechanism that prevents overexpenditure on resources during starvation. a similar effect is observed in adult worms. disruption of this translocation may explain how the increased longevity of the age- <dig> mutant has no detrimental effects apart from the cost of competiveness during cycles of starvation and feeding  <cit> .
