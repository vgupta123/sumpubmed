BACKGROUND
the inner ear has absorptive pathways for both na+ and k+ that contribute to the homeostasis of the composition of endolymph, the luminal fluid. the regulation of the ion composition of endolymph is essential for normal hearing  <cit> . transepithelial k+ efflux through the sensory hair cells in the cochlea is responsible for detection of sound. parasensory k+ absorption through other cell types is needed to compensate for changes in sensory cell k+ flux due to changes in levels of stimulation from acoustic inputs. the cochlear outer sulcus is an epithelial domain known to participate in absorption of both k+ and na+  <cit> .

absorptive mechanisms are needed to remove na+ from endolymph in order to maintain osmotic balance, to prevent loading of sensory hair cells with na+ and to maintain functional physical properties of the tectorial membrane. na+, like k+, is absorbed via nonselective cation channels in the apical membranes of outer sulcus cells. in addition, na+ appears to be absorbed via an amiloride-sensitive pathway in reissner's membrane  of the cochlea.

the transepithelial current across rm was shown to be inhibited by amiloride and its analog, benzamil  <cit> . the most commonly-observed target of these drugs is the epithelial sodium channel , which is usually composed of the three subunits α-,β- and γ-enac. however, other combinations of enac subunits and other cation channels have also been observed to be sensitive to amiloride and benzamil. further, those channels are not as selectively permeable to na+ over k+ and would therefore provide a potential pathway for parasensory k+-absorption.

in view of the high luminal concentration of k+ in the inner ear  and the importance of k+ efflux pathways for endolymph homeostasis, we investigated whether rm epithelial cells could support parasensory k+ absorption via amiloride-sensitive electrogenic pathways. the results show that acutely isolated rm has a highly na+-selective transport pathway, without detectable contributions from k+. the processes studied have several properties of the classical enac channel including inhibition by amiloride and benzamil, high selectivity for na+ over k+ and a higher permeability to li+ over na+.

RESULTS
we have shown in previous studies that reissner's membrane in mouse and gerbil absorbs na+ from the cochlear lumen by electrogenic transepithelial transport, which was apparently mediated by apical enac, basolateral na+,k+-atpase, and basolateral k+ channels  <cit> . this na+ absorption was blocked by amiloride and benzamil. the most commonly-observed target of these drugs is enac, comprised of the three subunits α-, β- and γ-enac. we addressed the question of cation selectivity of this pathway in reissner's membrane epithelial cells with  <dig> series of patch clamp experiments and selective candidate gene expression analysis.

benzamil-sensitive currents under whole-cell patch clamp
we first tested whether benzamil-sensitive currents, which was earlier observed as transepithelial currents with the current-density vibrating probe  <cit> , could be detected under whole-cell patch clamp conditions . indeed, benzamil  reduced the inward current when the pipette and bath solutions  approximated the physiological situation  .

indeed, benzamil  reduced the inward current when the kcl-rich pipette solution  mimicked the presumed intracellular composition  and when the nacl-rich bath  mimicked the basolateral  composition, . benzamil was used throughout these experiments at a concentration  that yielded a complete inhibition of the transepithelial current  <cit>  and significantly inhibited the inward whole-cell current  by  <dig> %; from - <dig> ±  <dig> pa to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa . these whole-cell data are consistent with the transepithelial measurements of na+ absorption by reissner's membrane.

expression of benzamil-sensitive cation channels in rm
we utilized gene array and rt-pcr to partially address the question of the participation of benzamil-sensitive nonselective cation  channels. several isoforms of acid-sensitive ion channels  and cyclic-nucleotide gated  channels were listed in our gene array of mouse reissner's membrane   <cit> . asic1a, 2a, 2b,  <dig> and  <dig> were listed; asic1a and  <dig> yielded a call of "present", but asic1a was tested by rt-pcr and determined to be "absent" . asic <dig> was not determined by rt-pcr; however, asic <dig> is stimulated, rather than inhibited, by amiloride at neutral ph  <cit>  and therefore would not be expected to contribute to the currents measured in the present study. cnga <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and cngb <dig> were listed in the gene array and all received a call of "absent". cnga <dig> and cngb <dig> were not listed in the gene array and were not tested by rt-pcr. as mentioned above, enac can be a nsc channel under some subunit combinations and the α-,β- and γ -enac subunits were all expressed in rm .

na+ and k+ conductance of benzamil-sensitive current
whole-cell patch clamp currents were measured  under conditions where the only major permeant ions were either na+ or k+ . cl- was replaced by methanesulfonate . in symmetrical na+-rich bath and pipette solutions , the current-voltage  relationship was nearly linear, with a slight inward rectification at large negative voltage. the slight inward rectification observed at large negative voltage in the first series of symmetrical na+ experiments was at least partially due to the time dependence of the response. this series utilized  <dig> ms voltage steps and the second linear series utilized  <dig> ms steps. the strong rectification of the benzamil-sensitive current, however, may at least partially be due to the known voltage sensitivity of inhibition of enac by benzamil  <cit> . benzamil significantly inhibited the inward whole-cell current  by  <dig> %; from i- <dig> = - <dig> ±  <dig> pa to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa . some experiments displayed a slow rundown in channel activity, as has been observed by others  <cit> . a representative experiment is shown in figure  <dig> and a summary of similar experiments is shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> 

*ms: methanesulfonate

in symmetrical k+-rich bath and pipette solutions , the current and conductance at - <dig> mv were significantly smaller than in na+ . benzamil had no significant effect on the inward whole-cell current  . a representative experiment is shown in figure  <dig> and a summary of similar experiments is shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> 

li+/na+ permeability ratio of benzamil-sensitive current
the high na+ selectivity of the benzamil-sensitive current over k+ suggested that enac might mediate part or all of that current. one salient characteristic of enac is a higher permeability to li+ than to na+. we compared  whole-cell currents in the presence of li+ and na+ in the bath and the effects of benzamil. the comparisons were conducted in two series of paired measurements from the same experimental data set in order to minimize the effects of rundown. in the first series of measurements , inward li currents were tested for sensitivity to benzamil. a representative experiment is shown in figure 3a and its i-v releationship in figure 3b. the i-v relationships were very similar for both na+  and li+  and benzamil markedly decreased the inward currents for both ions. specifically, benzamil significantly inhibited the inward li+ whole-cell current  by  <dig> %; from i- <dig> = - <dig> ±  <dig> pa to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa  . similarly, benzamil decreased  the inward na+ current at - <dig> mv by  <dig> % , a decrease that was not significantly different from the decrease by benzamil seen in the previous series  of experiments with na+ in the bath .

it was to be expected that there would be no change in the observed vr between the presence and absence of benzamil since the reversal potential for both na+-selectective and nsc channels are both =  <dig>  by contrast, if li+ is more permeable than na+, vr would be expected to become more positive .

in the second series of measurements , na+ and li+ i-v relationships were compared immediately before and after the solution change . rapid change of the bath solution from a na+-rich solution  to a li+-rich solution  led to small but consistent changes in the current. the average inward current and conductance at large negative voltage  were significantly larger for li+ than for na+, by  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . further, the reversal voltage was significantly more positive  .

the shift in vr was analyzed with the goldman-hodgkin-katz  equation as applied to bionic substitutions to estimate the relative membrane permeability to li+ and na+  <cit> :

 Δvr=rtzfinpliopnao, 

where Δvr is the change in reversal potential, r the universal gas constant, t the absolute temperature, z the valence, f the faraday constant, o the extracellular li+ concentration, o the extracellular na+ concentration and pli and pna the permeabilities of the membrane for li+ and na+. the shift of vr by  <dig>  mv in the current study corresponds to a pli/pna ratio of  <dig> . this result is within the range of reports by others for the ratio in αβγ-enac .

benzamil-insensitive cation channels
we hypothesized that the residual current after inhibition by benzamil could be transported through nonselective cation channels, although a substantial contribution of nsc channels was unlikely since k+ conductance was relatively small. alternatively, the residual current could be a patch leakage current.

it was first observed that transcripts of trpv <dig>  an amiloride-insensitive nsc channel, were present by both gene array and rt-pcr . the amiloride-insensitive channels hcn1- <dig> are permeable to k+ and na+  and were found to be absent by rt-pcr, although some false positives in the gene array were found .

we tested for the presence of benzamil-insensitive currents by comparing the inward current in the presence and absence of benzamil with a substitution of the impermeable cation nmdg+ for na+ in the bath.

in this series of experiments , the initial phase before benzamil did not quickly reach a stable condition so that parameters in benzamil were compared to those after washout. nonetheless, it is clear that the inward current and conductance in benzamil were significantly less than the inward na+ current and conductance after washout . importantly, there was no significant difference between the inward current in benzamil  and in nmdg+ . these results demonstrate that there were no cation currents other than the benzamil-sensitive channels under these conditions.

na+ in the pipette was reduced to  <dig> mm  in order to confirm the na+-selectivity of the current in this experimental series. the large decrease in vr between na+  and nmdg+   is consistent with a large na+ conductance. the small, but significant, decrease in vr between ± benzamil could conceivably be due to the presence of an h+ conductance and the small ph gradient between intra- and extracellular solutions. the equilibrium potential for na+ was + <dig> mv and for h+ was + <dig> mv. the absence of any significant difference  in i+ <dig>  in nmdg+ and na+ baths  is consistent with the current at + <dig> mv being carried predominantly by the efflux of intracellular na+, since the pipette concentration  remained the same for both bath solutions.

discussion
active na+ absorption is needed to remove na+ that has entered cochlear endolymph through as-yet-undefined pathways. elevated na+ would provide an osmotic driving force for water entry that would lead to endolymphatic hydrops, a pathologic swelling of the luminal space. in addition, the cochlear epithelium requires parasensory k+-efflux pathways to compensate for changes in k+ efflux through sensory hair cells during changes in auditory stimulation.

in addition to na+ and k+ absorption from endolymph via the outer sulcus cells in the cochlear lateral wall  <cit> , reissner's membrane epithelium has been found to actively absorb na+ from endolymph via amiloride- and benzamil-sensitive pathways. this transport was thought to be mediated by the epithelial na+ channel  in the apical membrane of these cells  <cit> .

the classical enac is highly selective to the passage of na+ over k+ . however, there are reports of poorly-selective epithelial na+ absorptive pathways under some culture conditions and this can be due to either altered enac subunit stoichiometry or increased expression of unrelated nonselective cation channels  <cit> . heteromeric channels composed of the α-, β- and γ-enac subunits are highly na+-selective, while homomeric α-enac channels are also permeable to k+  <cit> . homo- and hetero-meric enac are pharmacologically defined by their inhibition by amiloride and its analogs  <cit> . all  <dig> enac subunits are expressed in reissner's membrane  <cit> , but the stoichiometric subunit association in the apical membrane of reissner's membrane epithelial cells is not known. in addition, other cation channels such as acid sensitive ion channels  and cyclic nucleotide gated channels  have been observed to be sensitive to amiloride and benzamil   <cit> .

a vestige of doubt therefore remained whether the benzamil-sensitive current could also carry k+ as well as na+.

we tested the hypothesis that the benzamil-sensitive na+ absorption pathway in reissner's membrane could also carry a k+ current. our results showed the absence of transcript expression of many candidate nonselective cation channels and the functional absence of both benzamil-sensitive and -insensitve nonselective cation currents. the results demonstrated a high selectivity of the benzamil-sensitive pathway to na+ over k+.

one further test of the molecular identity of the benzamil-sensitive pathway was a comparison of the permeability to li+ and na+. the greater permeability to li+ is consistent with the benzamil-sensitive current carried by the classical αβγ -enac.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study support the conclusion that the benzamil-sensitive whole-cell current in reissner's membrane epithelial cells is highly selective for na+ and does not support the transport of k+. when this is combined with the results of previous studies on the benzamil-sensitive transepithelial current, it suggests that reissner's membrane contributes to maintaining the low na+ concentration in normal endolymph but is not involved in k+ homeostasis through this pathway .
