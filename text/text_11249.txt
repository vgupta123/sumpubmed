BACKGROUND
escherichia coli k- <dig> utilises type i-e crispr  loci to gain immunity to invasive dna such as bacteriophage , dependent on activities of cas  proteins reviewed in . crispr loci are composed of the at-rich leader region followed by arrays of sequence repeats separated by spacers that are homologous to sequences of invading dna . crispr arrays are transcribed into “pre-crrna” that is further processed into “crrna” that contains a full or partial spacer sequence reviewed in . in e. coli, crrna assembled into “cascade”  is targeted to protospacers in “interference” reactions. e. coli cascade comprises five proteins: cse <dig> , cse <dig> , cas <dig> , cas <dig>  and cas6e  . interference generates base pairing between crrna and protospacer dna in an r-loop, displacing the dna strand that is not complementary to crrna . this single stranded dna is degraded by cas <dig> helicase-nuclease .

cascade catalyses interference r-loops by a sequential process reliant on recognition of protospacer adjacent motif  sequences located immediately next to a protospacer on the target protospacer dna . crispr arrays lack a pam sequence, helping to prevent targeting of self-dna by cascade . in e. coli k- <dig> pam 5′-ctt-3′ is most prevalent   <cit> , and of  <dig> possible pams, five pams are tolerated by cascade to promote interference  <cit> . the cse <dig>  subunit of cascade is important for pam recognition, and for positioning cas <dig> to degrade invader dna  <cit> . after pam recognition, stable r-loop formation requires complementarity between the crrna-dna in a “seed” region . upon reaching the end of the protospacer the r-loop becomes locked  <cit>  and by pushing cse <dig> dimer it induces repositioning of cse <dig> and cse <dig> proteins, and conformational change of the whole cascade complex  <cit> . after locking of the r-loop, additional pam verification guides cas <dig> binding near the pam  <cit>  and degradation of the dna  <cit> .

“escape” mutations in phage dna can reduce the stability of e. coli cascade r-loops when they arise in a protospacer seed or a pam, and correspond to reduced resistance to plaque formation . other mutations in phage dna protospacers are tolerated for interference   <cit> . this is because five cas <dig> proteins fold over every sixth nucleotide of the crrna which are flipped outward and do not participate in dna recognition . recent results showed that the crrna spacer sequence also has significant role in helping interference machinery to recognize protospacer with single point mutations within the seed sequence or pam  <cit> . escape mutations that block interference promote rapid acquisition of new spacers from the same target dna, a process called ‘primed’ adaptation that suggests cross-talk between cas1-cas <dig> dna capture and alternative binding mode of cascade that promotes priming  <cit> . primed adaptation is a very robust process that tolerates up to  <dig> mutations either in pam or protospacer region  <cit> . spacers newly acquired during primed adaptation therefore provide elevated protection against invader whose escape mutations were evading robust interference by cascade  <cit> .

in e. coli h-ns  represses transcription of crispr and the genes encoding cascade, cas <dig> and cas <dig>  e. coli leuo de-represses transcription of genes encoding cascade, by blocking cooperative spreading of h-ns along the promoter of the initially transcribed cascade gene, cse <dig>  <cit> . in addition to h-ns and leuo, crp  is a transcriptional repressor of cas genes in e. coli  <cit> . the crp binding site in this case overlaps with the leuo binding site, leading to the proposal that crp and leuo compete for binding to the cse <dig> promoter depending on the cellular availability of camp  <cit> . in contrast to the apparent complexity of transcriptional regulation of cascade and crispr, factors that control transcription of e. coli cas <dig> have not been identified.

experimental analyses of crispr-cas in e. coli can overcome influences of h-ns, leuo and crp repression by engineering inducible expression of crispr, cascade and cas <dig> from plasmids or their chromosomal loci  <cit> . deletion of h-ns , or ectopic over-expression of leuo in cells with engineered anti-λ spacer  into crispr, promote crispr interference observed as enhanced resistance to phage λvir  <cit> . in these studies the protospacer targeted by spacer λt <dig> crrna had a non-consensus pam 5′-cca-3′ and although resistance to phage λvir from these strains was effective at 30 °c, we noticed that at 37 °c cells became sensitive to plaque formation. we investigated this further in Δhns cells that had acquired a new spacer  targeting protospacer with the consensus pam 5′-ctt-3′. we report that the effect of temperature on crispr immunity in these e. coli cells was correlated to expression of cas <dig> and its chaperone htpg . inducible ectopic expression of cas <dig> in the presence, but not absence, of chromosomal htpg rescued resistance to phage at 37 °c. further research will be required to uncover how temperature causes this effect on activity of the e. coli crispr-cas system.

RESULTS
temperature-dependent resistance of Δhns e. coli cells to phage λvir is not caused by pam sequence variation
genetic analysis of e. coli crispr-cas in previous studies established that h-ns represses transcription of the operon encoding cascade, cas1-cas <dig>  and crispr locus  <dig>  . deleting h-ns  from cells de-repressed transcription, and efficient resistance to λvir infection at 30 °c was reported when crispr of Δhns cells was engineered to contain an anti-λ phage spacer sequence   <cit> . the importance of the λt <dig> spacer was highlighted by sensitivity of Δhns cells to λvir plaque formation compared to Δhns + λt <dig> cells  <cit> . when repeating these experiments we also observed about  <dig> fold elevated resistance of Δhns + λt <dig> cells to λvir infection at 30 °c, compared to Δhns cells without λt <dig> spacer . however at 37 °c, in otherwise identical assays, Δhns + λt <dig> cells became sensitive to phage . cells with intact h-ns , with or without λt <dig>  were sensitive to λvir infection at both temperatures . there was no difference in sensitivity at 37 °c between Δhns cells + or - λt <dig> spacer. if λt <dig> spacer was absent from the crispr locus  <dig> , Δhns cells showed threefold increase in resistance at 30 °c in comparison to 37 °c . therefore using 30 °c temperature of incubation in infectivity assays is an important factor for promoting resistance of Δhns + λt <dig> cells to phage λvir.table  <dig>

the λt <dig> spacer sequence engineered into crispr used here and in  <cit>  has a nucleotide sequence match with the template strand of λ phage gene lysis r, but the pam sequence  deviates from consensus 5′-ctt-3′ e. coli pam  <cit> . single nucleotide variations in pams may disrupt interference in type i-e, i-f and type ii crispr systems by preventing r-loop priming and degradation of invading dna  <cit> . five pams, cat, ctt, cct, ctc and cta found previously  <cit> , are utilized by cascade for robust interference, and ten non-consensus pams give a partial resistance phenotype  <cit> . therefore, pam 5′-cca-3′ belongs to the latter group, giving partial resistance to λvir as expected from previous data  <cit> . however, recent findings showed that spacer sequence dictates whether mutant pam sequences will be tolerated for interference or not  <cit> . we investigated if the observed major difference in phage resistance of Δhns cells at 30 °c and 37 °c was related to pam sequence by introducing spacer targeting protospacer with the consensus pam 5′-ctt-3′ into crispr. to do this we provoked Δhns + λt <dig> e. coli to acquire a new spacer. one such e. coli derivative containing spacer  targeting phage λvir gene cii with a 5′-ctt-3′ pam was selected. the procedure is detailed in the methods and supplementary material. the constructed strain  also contains Δcas <dig> mutation as a useful controlling factor to uncouple interference from adaptation, enabling focus on interference reaction only. in phage infectivity assays, hns+ Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells were sensitive to λvir phage at 30 °c and 37 °c, as expected because h-ns represses cas genes . Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells showed ~ <dig> fold increase in resistance at 30 °c compared to hns+ Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig>  and ~ <dig> compared to Δhns Δcas1 + λt <dig> cells, but remained sensitive to λvir infection at 37 °c . this showed that Δcas <dig> mutation did not affect interference as expected and confirmed the importance of a consensus pam for phage resistance in infectivity assays at 30 °c, explained in previous studies by the effect of variable pams on efficacy of interference reactions  <cit> . however, added spacer targeting the consensus pam 5′-ctt-3′ was not able to repeal the temperature dependent resistance of Δhns cells to λvir in these assays, which we concluded must be caused by other factor .table  <dig> list of strains used in this study

transcription and stability of cas <dig> in Δhns cells is limiting for resistance to phage
we tested if the effect of temperature on phage resistance was influenced by variations in expression of e. coli crispr-cas. robust resistance of Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells to λvir  suggested all components of crispr-cas were expressed in sufficient amounts at 30 °c. a previous analysis identified increased transcription of genes encoding cascade and crrna in Δhns cells grown to mid-log phase, but no such increase in cas <dig> transcripts  <cit> . we explored if levels of cas <dig> rna or protein in cells might correlate to phage resistance under different temperature conditions of infectivity assays.

by using quantitative pcr  we compared cas <dig> transcript levels between hns+ and Δhns cells in both mid-log and stationary phases of growth. relative abundance of cas <dig> transcripts was around eight-fold higher in Δhns cells compared to hns+ cells when grown to stationary phase, regardless of the temperature being 30 °c or 37 °c , but remained similar at mid-log phase . this suggested that the growth phase was important for the observed difference in the level of cas <dig> transcripts, not the temperature of incubation. as shown in fig.  <dig>  only Δhns + λt <dig> cells showed significant difference in cas <dig> transcripts depending on the temperature of incubation ). increased cas <dig> transcription at stationary phase at 30 °c or 37 °c was not observed if h-ns was present, and presence of λc + λt <dig> spacers had no effect on cas <dig> transcript levels . these results suggest that the sensitivity of Δhns cells to λvir plaques at 37 °c is unlikely to be due to lack of cas <dig> transcription. we therefore tested if cas <dig> protein levels may influence phage sensitivity at 37 °c. the chaperone htpg was also considered here, because htpg increases steady-state cas <dig> protein levels in e. coli, which correlated to stimulation of interference reactions, carried out at 32 °c  <cit> . we reasoned that sensitivity of Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells to λvir at 37 °c caused by reduced or unstable cas <dig> protein might be overcome by plasmid expression of htpg or cas <dig>  however, we observed that  expression of only cas <dig> from plasmid restored resistance of Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells to λvir at 37 °c comparably to at 30 °c, while cells containing empty plasmid vectors  or htpg expressing plasmid remained sensitive. these results suggest that endogenous levels of functionally active cas <dig> in Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells are too low to be relieved by elevated levels of htpg at 37 °c. given the importance of htpg for phage resistance it was expected that elimination of htpg from Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells  would cause sensitivity to phage at both 30 °c and 37 °c , compared to phage resistance observed in fig. 2a. indeed, plaques were observed at 30 °c in Δhtpg Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells with or without empty plasmid controls. however, individual plaques were not visible, so the number of pfu is estimation . plasmid expression of cas <dig>  in Δhtpg Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells was sufficient for phage resistance at 30 °c  indicating that elevated amounts of cas <dig> is efficient in phage defence independently of htpg at 30 °c as shown before  <cit> . in contrast, elevated levels of cas <dig>  in Δhtpg Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells did not rescue phage resistance at 37 °c confirming the importance of htpg in maintaining functional levels of cas <dig> in phage defence. as expected, although plasmid expression of htpg  in Δhtpg Δhns + λc + λt <dig> cells rescued phage resistance at 30 °c, it did not at 37 °c . given the known interplay of htpg and cas <dig> in promoting crispr interference in e. coli, these results suggest that levels of cas <dig> protein are the limiting factor for resistance to λvir phage infection in Δhns cells at 37 °c. overall, these results show that endogenous levels of cas <dig> are expressed in low but sufficient amounts for the crispr-cas mediated immunity in cells lacking h-ns grown to stationary phase at 30 °c, but that the levels of functionally active cas <dig> becomes limiting at 37 °c and require increased levels of cas <dig> fig.  <dig> cas <dig> is transcribed in cells lacking h-ns at both temperatures of incubation in stationary phase of growth. qpcr analysis extended to Δhns Δcas <dig> and hns

discussion
by manipulating the expression of h-ns and crispr-cas in e. coli cells we identified that stability or activity of cas <dig>  with htpg present, is a limiting factor for resistance to phage λvir at 37 °c. our genetic analyses of crispr interference at 30 °c agreed with previous studies, by observing robust phage resistance when cells were lacking h-ns repressor , and when an anti-λ spacer could target protospacer dna next to a consensus pam, 5′-ctt-3′. however, the same assays at 37 °c resulted in a dramatic loss of phage resistance that had not been observed previously. phage resistance could be restored at 37 °c, to levels comparable with resistance at 30 °c, by inducible expression of cas <dig> from plasmids.

previous analyses of cas <dig> transcription sampled only during mid-log growth and showed no difference between Δhns cells compared to hns+ cells, unlike cascade genes and crrna that were much increased in Δhns cells  <cit> . we measured cas <dig> transcripts in mid-log and stationary phase, observing that Δhns cells contained eight-fold more cas <dig> transcript compared to hns+ cells at 30 °c and 37 °c. this is significant because infectivity assays for measuring resistance of e. coli to λvir use cells in stationary phase. we conclude from this analysis that h-ns regulates expression of the cas <dig> gene, as well as cascade and crrna, but possibly does so under more specific growth conditions.

recently it was highlighted that cas <dig> requires htpg chaperone for crispr interference assays  <cit> : overexpression of htpg or cas <dig> from plasmids in htpg deficient cells  rescued transformation-efficiency at 32 °c. we observed similar interplay of htpg and cas <dig> at 30 °c because plasmid overexpression of either htpg or cas <dig>  could restore phage resistance to Δhtpg Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig>  cells that were otherwise sensitive to phage infection . interestingly, the pcas <dig> alone did not restore phage resistance to Δhtpg Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig> cells at 37 °c  but did to htpg+ Δhns Δcas1 + λc + λt <dig>  cells at 37 °c , while phtpg was unable to sustain phage resistance to any Δhns cells at 37 °c. thus, htpg is important for crispr-system activity in Δhns cells at 37 °c, but its overexpression from plasmid alone cannot overcome limiting amounts of functionally active cas <dig> at 37 °c. further research will be required to better understand the reasons and mechanisms of cas <dig> instability in Δhns cells at 37 °c.

in addition to four σ <dig> -promoters in crispr-cas area, two potential σ <dig> -dependent promoters have been mapped within coding regions of cas <dig> and cas <dig>  <cit> , suggesting another possible link between crispr-cas immunity and heat-shock response. in summary, expression and activity of the crispr-cas system in e. coli seem to be linked to global stress responses, such as h-ns global repressor, heat stress and crp-camp. perhaps, crispr-cas immunity is designed to become activated during certain phase of growth, at specific environmental habitats and temperature, and instability of the cas <dig> may be the mechanism for inactivation of the crispr-cas defence either at inappropriate temperature of incubation or when degradation of foreign dna is completed.

CONCLUSIONS
we observed that the ability of an e. coli crispr-cas system to resist lysis by phage λ was strongly influenced by temperature. genetic analysis of this effect indicated that sensitivity to phage at 37 °c was caused by limiting amounts of cas <dig>  rather than effects of pam sequence variations on cascade interference reactions. we show that transcription of cas <dig> is controlled by h-ns: elimination of h-ns from cells correlated to eight-fold increased levels of cas <dig> transcript, specifically in stationary phase growth. at 37 °c, increased expression of cas <dig> is required for resistance to λ infection. this suggests that endogenous expression and activity of cas <dig> is responsive to signals associated with growth phase and temperature in e. coli.
