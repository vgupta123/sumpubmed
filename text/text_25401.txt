BACKGROUND
citrus fruits are the first fruit crop in international trade in terms of economic value . citrus fruits are typically grown in  <dig> countries located in tropical and subtropical areas with "mediterranean" type climates, often facing severe abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought and iron chlorosis. citrus species also suffer from different diseases and pests that considerably affect tree growth and fruit crop. the survival of the citrus industry is today critically dependent on genetically superior cultivars. however, citrus improvement through traditional techniques is unfortunately very difficult due to the unusual combination of biological characteristics of citrus species, their low genetic diversity and the long-term nature of tree breeding. thus, citrus show many biological characteristics such as gametophytic self- and cross-incompatibility, apomixy, juvenility, heterozygosis, dormancy, and surprising root/shoot interactions, that strongly hamper citrus breeding. on the other hand, genetic and allelic diversity in citrus cultivars is very scarce. the global linkage disequilibrium in the cultivated citrus that probably originated from three major taxa, may be the result of an initial allopatric evolution and further limitation for predominant apomixy  <cit> . the fact that only mutational and/or epigenetic events are apparently involved in the diversification of secondary species, combined with human selection, have strongly reduced global genetic diversity, restricting opportunity for genetic advance.

genomics has provided new tools for crop improvement, helping to identify and select candidate genes responsible of agronomic characters of interest, and allowing the development of fast methods to incorporate these characters into crop plants. after the completion of the arabidopsis genome sequence  <cit>  and the publication of sequences of indica  <cit>  and japonica  <cit>  rice, plant researchers have been able to scan these genomes to identify and compare genes of interest. the completion of the poplar genome sequence  <cit>  will supply a model for tree life forms.

est sequencing projects have facilitated appropriate strategies for gene discovery  <cit> , molecular markers identification  <cit> , and many other functional genomic developments and tools, e.g. microarray approaches  <cit> . in citrus, previous est sequencing projects have released more than  <dig> ests to gen bank, mainly from c. sinensis, c. unshiu and c. clementina  <cit> . this information has been used to develop two different microarray platforms, based on cdna and short oligo sequences  <cit> . in this work, main efforts have been specifically focussed on the study of pivotal traits for citrus breeding, such as fruit quality, productivity and salinity tolerance. in citrus there are many aspects of fruit quality such as fruit size, shape, colour, texture, flavour and aroma compounds, and several other organoleptic properties that are acquired during ripening and earlier stages of growth  <cit> . regarding productivity, pivotal traits to be improved are the capacity for fruit set and the resistance to abscission. clementine mandarin , for example, is a self-incompatible cultivar that shows elevated ovary and fruitlet abscission while sweet orange varieties , that in general exhibit standard fruit-set ratios  <cit> , may lose most of the yield during ripening. in addition, the quantity and quality of water can become a limiting factor to economically viable production. in citrus, it is notorious for example, that during the periods of drought, leaves and fruits remain attached to the tree until water is available and soon afterwards these organs abscise  <cit> . it is also well known that salt excess affects the size and quality of the production. the capability of citrus to tolerate salinity is mostly related to the ability of the rootstock to exclude chloride, although the nature of this mechanism remains unresolved  <cit> . tolerant cleopatra mandarin rootstock , for example, accumulated lower chloride amounts than sensitive carrizo   <cit> . the scion variety also plays a role in salinity damage, and more tolerant varieties such as clementine are generally preferred to sweet oranges  <cit> . toward this goal, cdna libraries were prepared from the following selected genotypes: the varieties citrus clementina  and c. sinensis , and the rootstocks c. reshni , and c. sinenis × poncirus trifoliata . the information generated with this effort, complementary to the spanish citrus functional genomics project  <cit> , has also been used for the construction of a second generation cdna microarray of recent release. in the study, special attention has been paid on the methodological aspects, in order to obtain accurate estimates of the number of different transcripts and precise predictions of their function.

the results of this joint initiative of the ivia, cirad and genoscope designed to provide new information and useful tools for citrus improvement, will speed up the discovery of genes of major agronomic interest and facilitate the development of new markers and methods to rapidly identify improved genotypes.

RESULTS
library construction
samples were harvested from  <dig> different citrus species: the varieties citrus clementina  and c. sinensis , and the rootstocks c. reshni , and c. sinenis × poncirus trifoliata .

est sequences were derived from  <dig> cdna libraries constructed with standard methods and  <dig> additional normalized full length cdna library . standard libraries, prepared from all five cultivars, were designed to represent three main agronomic traits of interest for citrus improvement, i.e. fruit quality, production and salt tolerance. since fruit quality characteristics are acquired not only during ripening but also along fruit growth  <cit> ,  <dig> libraries covering all pivotal developmental stages were constructed from fruit pulp and peel tissues of the high quality variety, clementine . abscission zones and surrounding tissues from developing ovaries, fruitlets, leaves and ripe fruits were represented in  <dig> libraries  from clementine, the genotype with impaired fruit set  <cit>  and washington navel, the variety with higher pre-harvest abscission. to study the response to abiotic stresses,  <dig> libraries were prepared with samples derived from leaves and roots subjected to salinity or dehydration  from the salt tolerant rootstock, cleopatra, the sensitive hybrid, carrizo and the sensitive scion, navelina  <cit> .

the full length library was constructed in clementine plants, the species of main interest, grown in open field and in controlled greenhouse conditions. a broad variety of tissues and organs at different developmental stages were harvested from healthy plants and from plants subjected to many biotic  and abiotic  stresses. this strategy was planned to obtain the widest representation of the citrus clementina transcriptome, including low abundant cdnas, and to facilitate identification of genes of agronomic interest. a detailed description of the libraries is given in materials and methods.

est sequencing and clustering
a total number of  <dig> clones were single-pass sequenced from their 5' end. after low quality and vector trimming,  <dig> sequences longer than  <dig> bp were assembled with the cap <dig> program  <cit> . all these sequences are available at the est section of the genbank. the assembly grouped  <dig> ests into  <dig> contigs, while  <dig> sequences remained as singletons. the combined set of contigs and singletons resulted in  <dig> unigenes representing different putative transcripts from citrus species. the average length of the unigenes was  <dig> bp, and  <dig> of them  were longer than  <dig> bp. the distribution of ests in the contigs was the expected, with many clusters composed of  <dig> or less ests . to estimate redundancy levels, the  <dig> unigenes were compared with each other with the blastn program  <cit> . sequences with at least 98% nucleotide identity over a minimum of  <dig> bp were assumed to be derived from the same transcript and therefore were clustered in supercontigs using an in-house r algorithm. clustering of the unigenes resulted in  <dig> supercontigs and  <dig> singletons, indicating ~26% redundancy. thus, the real number of identified expressed genes was close to  <dig> 

the unigene consensus sequences were used as queries in a blastn search against a database including  <dig> ests from citrus species retrieved from genbank. an e value of 1e- <dig> was used as a cut off to ensure that only almost identical sequences were detected. the results showed that more than  <dig> unigenes  did not produce a significant hit, indicating that these sequences had not previously been described in citrus est collections. however, the possibility that other parts of the same parental genes were present in these collections can not be discarded. most novel sequences  were derived from the normalized library and might represent transcripts expressed at very low levels. this idea was supported by the fact that 75% of these sequences were singletons. on the other hand, no major divergences or differences at the sequence level were observed between all citrus species analyzed, including the five cultivars used in this study and those with sequences submitted to genbank .

the analysis of the contigs  indicated that many of them were composed of ests from a single library , while only  <dig> contigs  included ests from  <dig> or more libraries. the unigene contig <dig> that displayed high similarity with atpase-like proteins, for example, was found in  <dig> libraries, although it was composed of only  <dig> ests. the number of exclusive unigenes of a given cdna library was obtained adding the number of singletons and the contigs composed of ests from this library . it was determined that  <dig>  clusters were exclusive of a particular library. the standard cdna libraries provided ~21% of the assembled ests while the number of exclusive clusters from these libraries represented more than 26% of the unigenes.

sequence annotation
annotation of the assembled sequences was initially based on primary sequence homology searches. a blastx search performed against the genbank non redundant protein database  <cit>  with an e value cut off ≤ 1e- <dig>  yielded  <dig> unigenes with significant hits. a number of  <dig> protein homologs were annotated as unknown, unnamed, hypothetical or expressed proteins.

blastx searches were also performed against the complete protein sets of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and oryza sativa  <cit> . the results were similar, since  <dig> and  <dig> significant hits were found in arabidopsis and rice, respectively. blast results were parsed, determining for each citrus unigene, the best hit name and description, the extent of the aligned region, the percentage of similarity and the e value. sequences were classified based on the orf conservation:  <dig> unigenes had very high similarities ,  <dig> clusters showed high similarities , while only  <dig> unigenes had moderate similarities  and  <dig> sequences displayed low similarities . no similarities below 30% were obtained. these results indicated that a large number of unigenes  had a very strong match  with the top-score hit of the blastx results.

the extent of the region of similarity between a given unigene and its best hit protein was also determined, including all high-scoring segment pairs  for one hit. to this end, the following assumptions were taken: when similarity regions expanded along the complete length of the hit protein, unigenes were supposed to include a complete orf; if hsps matched the amino-terminal region of the hit sequence, the cdna clones from which these ests were derived probably contained a complete mrna partially sequenced; finally, when hsps located at the carboxy-terminal region of the hit protein, cdna clones were assumed to correspond to truncated mrnas. the citrus unigenes were classified according to these criteria, resulting in  <dig> complete orfs,  <dig> complete cdna clones, and  <dig> partial or truncated cdna clones. taken together the complete orfs and clones, the citrus est collection contained at least,  <dig> complete cdna clones.

the species of the best hit sequences produced in the blastx search against the non redundant database were registered and classified . not surprisingly,  <dig> hits  corresponded to a. thaliana and  <dig>  to other eudicots species. about  <dig> unigenes produced significant best hits from species other than plants , with a high degree of conservation .  <dig> of these clusters had no significant hits from arabidopsis or rice, and a blastn search performed against the non redundant and est genbank databases, confirmed they might be contaminant sequences not originated from citrus species.

a considerable number of sequences  did not produce a significant hit in the blast searches performed. the correlation between the number of sequences that produced no hits and the length of the unigene , showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> sequences shorter than  <dig> bp  did not produce a significant hit, while the percentage was only 7% for longer sequences . since the blastx searches were performed against protein databases, the high number of no hits found for the clusters shorter than  <dig> bp, may indicate that these regions did not contain coding sequences, corresponding to mrna utrs. the absence of significant hits was certainly not due to low quality of the shorter sequences, because the level of similarity of the unigenes was always high regardless the size of the sequence , indicating that shorter sequences had the same quality than longer ones.

the sequences that did not produce significant hits were used as queries in a blastn search performed against the genbank non redundant nucleotide database  <cit> . only  <dig> unigenes produced significant hits showing high similarity levels . a total of  <dig> sequences presented similarity with the complete sequence of poncirus trifoliata citrus tristeza virus resistance gene locus, the only genomic bac clone  from a citrus species that has been sequenced  <cit> .

the same set of unigenes produced  <dig> significant hits  in a further blastn search against the genbank est database  <cit> , indicating that similar transcripts were previously isolated. further analysis showed that most of the hits derived only from citrus species, suggesting that these clusters might be putative citrus exclusive genes.

protein translation and annotation
a search for domains associated with a hidden markov model profile was intended to improve annotation of the est collection. to obtain better templates for annotation, the translation of the unigenes consensus sequences into polypeptide ones was carried out with the prot4est prediction pipeline, which produces robust translations from est sequences  <cit> . a blastp search was performed with the polypeptide sequences against the genbank protein database  <cit> , and 77% of them produced the same hit than the original dna sequences, showing the accuracy of the translations. all polypeptides shorter than  <dig> aa, and those shorter than  <dig> aa without a significant hit were discarded, and the final number of useful protein translations was  <dig>  the parsing of the blastp results confirmed that the unigenes initially classified as complete orfs coded for complete proteins.

once protein sequences were obtained and tested, searches against pattern or signature databases were performed. the interpro database was chosen for these searches, as it unites secondary databases that contain overlapping information on protein families, domains and functional sites  <cit> . the standalone version of the interproscan tool, that combines the protein function recognition methods of the member databases of interpro into one application, was used for the analysis. the total number of unigenes that produced hits and the number of different motifs identified varied highly depending on the database size and the analysis method. motif search against the pfam database produced the largest number of protein hits  and also identified a high number of different motifs . table  <dig> shows the  <dig> most abundant conserved domains found with pfam. these motifs were responsible of the 34% of the total hits. further analysis was carried out on the subset of  <dig> proteins predicted as complete with the blastx analyses that produced pfam hits . most of the proteins,  <dig> %, displayed a single type of functional domain; proteins combining  <dig> different motifs accounted for the  <dig> %, while polypeptides with  <dig> or  <dig> different conserved domains were in a low number .

gene ontology annotation
the gene ontology  annotation of the citrus unigene set was performed with blast2go   <cit> . b2g assigns go annotations through a 3-steps procedure: blast against protein databases, retrieval of all go annotations for a specified number of blast hits , and go assignment through an evaluated annotation rule . figure 3a shows the intensity of go annotation. a total of  <dig> unigenes were annotated with  <dig> annotations, distributed among the main gene ontology categories: biological process , molecular function  and cellular component . there were  <dig> sequences annotated with all three go categories, and  <dig> that had at least two annotations. failure in go term assignment was due to either a negative result in the blast search , the absence of go annotation in any of the blast hits  or because the sequence did not fulfil quality parameters of trustable annotation  . noteworthy was that most of these last 47% of sequences, i.e., sequences with a blast result without go term assignment, had best blast hits to unknown or hypothetical proteins, indicating the uncertainty in the functional characterization of the hit sequences.

to provide a general representation of the distribution of citrus gene ontology annotation, the slim go classification for plants developed at tair  <cit>  was obtained, and sets of genes according to broad go ontology categories were produced  <cit> . all functional categories in the biological processes classification were well represented in the citrus unigene set . similar results were obtained in the other main go classes, molecular function and cellular localization .

characterizing the citrus gene space
in an attempt to characterize the citrus gene space, a first analysis was performed to study the biological context of the novel unigenes. further studies were addressed to identify candidate genes for molecular markers, gene duplications and conserved gene families.

novelty and biological context
the results presented in this work identified more than  <dig> sequences that had not been included before in any citrus est collection, and could be, therefore, novel citrus unigenes. most of these sequences were derived from the normalized full-length library , that contained a mixed of reproductive and vegetative tissues particularly enriched with fruit tissues, abscission zones and salinity samples. thus, the unigene set of this library probably included many low abundant transcripts related to several physiological and developmental processes, including fruit quality, productivity and salinity, the targets of this study. interestingly, 20% of these novel unigenes corresponded to unknown proteins. the number of novel unigenes included into standard libraries was  <dig>  while  <dig> of them were annotated as unknown genes. to estimate the input of the standard libraries in terms of gene novelty, sets of unigenes known  to be involved in the three processes of interest were selected and the libraries containing them identified.

fruit quality includes many physical attributes and chemical characteristics of the fruit, such as sugar and acid content, flavour and aroma compounds . in addition, citrus fruits contain an extensive array of secondary compounds with pivotal nutritional properties. these traits that are acquired along fruit growth are controlled by primary, intermediate, and secondary metabolic pathways. in order to identify genes with relevant roles in fruit quality, homologs of structural enzymes from some of these pivotal metabolic pathways were searched in citrus. the pathways of known topology involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and their precursors, the glycolysis, the krebs cycle, the oxydative/nonoxydative pentose phosphate pathway, the aromatic aminoacid pathway and the general phenyl propanoid and flavonoid pathways were targeted. to identify the citrus unigenes that putatively coded for structural enzymes of the selected pathways, the ec number  <cit>  of the citrus predicted proteins was determined. the results indicated that these pathways were fully represented , and that most putative enzymatic activities were present with a significant degree of redundancy, both in terms of est  and unigenes  numbers. from a total of  <dig> unigenes  related to the enzymatic activities of the pathways analyzed in table  <dig>  it was found that about 15% of them corresponded to novel unigenes. for example,  <dig> out of the  <dig> unigenes assigned to the fructose  <dig>  biphosphate aldolase activity in the glycolitic pathway are described in this work for the first time. furthermore, 36% of the  <dig> enzymatic activities implicated in the processes displayed novel unigenes.

the lignin biosynthesis pathway was analyzed in detail, since lignin is an important component of the dietary fiber present in the fruit  <cit> , that has important benefits for human health  <cit> . this pathway has been recently described in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , and is also found at the aracyc database  <cit> . ests with significant similarity to any of the arabidopsis enzymes involved in this route were selected and reassembled with the staden gap <dig> program  <cit> . the number of unigenes was estimated by considering only those contigs showing non identical consensus sequences that overlapped significantly. for each enzymatic activity described in the lignin pathway a phylogenetic analysis that included the a. thaliana and citrus proteins was carried out. these analyses redefined the number of citrus unigenes that could be considered orthologs of the arabidopsis genes. the number of citrus ests and unigenes related to the arabidopsis proteins of the lignin pathway are shown in table  <dig>  all the enzymatic activities involved in this pathway were represented, and for  <dig> particular arabidopsis proteins, citrus possessed  <dig>   <dig> or even  <dig> orthologs according to the phylogenetic analysis a search for enzymes of this pathway performed on the annotation database of the draft sequence of the genome of populus trichocarpa  <cit> , produced similar results, with  <dig> gene models assigned to the 4-coumarate coenzyme a ligase activity, and  <dig> gene models to the caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase activity. these data suggest that multiple orthologs of all arabidopsis lignin proteins could be apparently found if enough number of citrus ests were analyzed, indicating the relevance of the lignification process in citrus. the comparison of the unigenes involved in lignin biosynthesis  against citrus ests from genbank, showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> orthologs produced not hits, indicating that they were novel genes reported in this work for the first time.

additional new unigenes implicated in fruit quality were selected based on published information  <cit>  from relevant pathways of lipids and fatty acid metabolism and degradation , synthesis and accumulation of citric acid , sugar  and nitrate transport , and chlorophyll synthesis . the analyses indicated that 64% of these novel genes were found in the normalized library, while  <dig> % of them were isolated from fruittf, one of the two fruit specific libraries. the other unigenes belonged to stress and abscission libraries.

the analysis of genes related to productivity was initially focused in  <dig> families that had been previously associated with the abscission process, the auxin responsive factors , the receptor protein kinases  and the erebp . the results showed that only one singleton  of the first family, contig <dig> of the second and contig <dig> of the third one, derived from standard abscission libraries , while the remaining members , were isolated from the normalized library. since many of the processes implicated in abscission are controlled by the selective removal of short-lived regulatory proteins, we also analyzed the occurrence of the ubiquitin/26s proteasome pathway  <cit>  among the novel sequences. this component, deeply involved in protein degradation, has not yet been related to abscission and, therefore, no previous information is available in this regard. interestingly, the only member of e2s ub-conjugating enzymes  found in the set of novel unigenes was detected in the absdev library. in addition,  <dig> members out of  <dig> e3s ub-ligases , were exclusively obtained from the abscission-related libraries. these putative unigenes may participate in the removal of repressor elements during the organ separation  <cit> . the other ub-ligases were mostly present in the normalized library. several cell wall structural proteins  and two specific glycosyl hydrolases  were exclusive of the abscission-related libraries, suggesting that abscission may also implicate active remodelling of cell walls  <cit> . aside from the normalized library, the abscission libraries that were strongly enriched with specific abscission zone tissues, showed a relatively high number of novel exclusive unigenes .

for the analyses of novel citrus genes potentially involved in abiotic stress, the following well established biological functions were investigated: sodium na+/h+ antiporters , that are probably involved in sodium detoxification  <cit> ; the calcineurin b gene homolog   <cit> , stress-induced and/or -activated protein kinases  and the mechano-sensitive ion channel-domain containing protein , that are likely implicated in nacl-associated signal transduction mechanisms; aldehyde dehydrogenases involved in detoxification   <cit> ; two genes of the inositol metabolism ; genes associated with lipid metabolism such as the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c  and the lipoxygenases ; and the membrane-associated salt-inducible protein . moreover, the following biological functions related to acclimatization to osmotic shock were searched: two different nced <dig> genes involved in aba biosynthesis   <cit> ; and two genes involved in trehalose metabolism . lastly, cell tolerance mechanisms universally linked to different abiotic stresses, represented by heat shock proteins and molecular chaperons  <cit> ; and uncharacterized stress-responsive genes  were also analyzed. the results of this search indicated that 42% of these abiotic stress related genes were detected in the normalized library, while  <dig> % of them was found in fruit libraries . only  <dig> unigene, a putative sodium na+/h+ antiporter , was found as a singleton in a salinity-related library, lsh, whereas only contig <dig>  contained ests exclusively derived from kcl-salt <dig>  another salinity library.

overall, these preliminary estimates showed that most of the novel genes, presumably implicated in fruit quality, abscission, and salinity responses, were effectively recovered in the normalized library. the contribution of the fruit and abscission libraries to the set of unigenes related to fruit quality or abscission, could be roughly estimated between  <dig> and 15%. the lower contribution of the salinity standard libraries  may be due to the abundance of unspecific cross-responses among multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. for an accurate estimation of these figures, however, confirmation of gene specificity appears to be mandatory.

molecular markers
the use of genetic and molecular markers is crucial to facilitate the identification and cloning of genes of agronomic interest  <cit> , while single copy genes are usually good candidates to be used as markers. to identify conserved a. thaliana orthologs present as single copy genes in both arabidopsis and citrus, a database with  <dig> arabidopsis single copy genes was obtained from the compositae genome project database  <cit> , and used in a blast search with the citrus unigene set as queries. a total of  <dig> citrus sequences showed an unambiguous single strong blast hit, and reciprocal blast searches  produced the same results. the outcome of this blast search was compared with that obtained in the blast search performed against all citrus ests from genbank. the results showed that  <dig> unigenes did not generate any hit, while  <dig> clusters only produced hits with similarities higher than 95%, suggesting that these were ests probably derived from the same transcript. although this analysis is not conclusive, the absence of hits or the occurrence of extremely high similarities, suggested that these  <dig> unigenes are strong candidates to be conserved orthologs of arabidopsis single copy genes.

gene duplications
the blast search with the arabidopsis single copy genes also produced  <dig> sequences with  <dig> or more strong citrus hits. these cases were further investigated as they might be indicative of gene duplication events produced in the citrus genome. in many cases, unigenes showing the same arabidopsis hit did not overlap, indicating that they may derive from the same transcript but were not assembled in the same contig, and therefore cannot be considered to be different genes. finally,  <dig> arabidopsis single copy genes showed strong similarity with two overlapping citrus unigenes. these clusters presented the same arabidopsis protein as their best hit, supporting the hypothesis that they are paralog genes in citrus .

gene family analysis
comparative genomics was used to characterize the conserved gene families in a. thaliana and citrus species. there are currently  <dig> gene families, comprising  <dig> genes, described at the arabidopsis thaliana information resource database  <cit> . the presence of these gene families in the citrus unigene set was explored, allocating the citrus clusters in the gene families based on the best arabidopsis significant hit obtained. about  <dig> citrus unigenes were assigned to  <dig> families, and  <dig> super families, showing that 78% and 92% of the arabidopsis families and superfamilies were represented in the citrus est collection. to exemplify the potential for citrus improvement of the information included in the est collection, two gene families with relevant agronomic interest were selected and analyzed in detail: the ammonium transporter family intimately related to plant nutritional efficiency and the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  implicated in sugar synthesis in fruit.

the arabidopis high-affinity ammonium transporter family is composed of six members: five proteins that form the atamt <dig> subfamily  <cit>  and a member, atamt <dig>  that is distantly related to the atamt <dig> subfamily  <cit> . similarity searches showed that  <dig> citrus ests were significantly similar to the arabidopsis ammonium transporters. these ests that corresponded to  <dig> unigenes  were translated into protein with prot4est. a multiple alignment of the a. thaliana and citrus sequences was performed with clustal x, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor joining method . the tree showed that  <dig> citrus unigenes closely related to atamt <dig> grouped together in a cluster supported by very high bootstrap values. thus, the amt <dig> subfamily of ammonium transporters in citrus comprised, at least,  <dig> proteins, suggesting the occurrence of a number of duplication events.

glycosyltransferase family  <dig> is composed of proteins with known α, α-trehalose-phosphate synthase udp-forming activity, and in a. thaliana comprises proteins at1g <dig> and at3g <dig>  a total of  <dig> citrus ests displaying significant similarity with the glycosyltransferase family  <dig> proteins were assembled into  <dig> unigenes grouped in  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. as above, phylogenetic analysis showed that the citrus and arabidopsis proteins clustered together, with high bootstrap values supporting the clade . this analysis suggests that the glycosyltransferase family  <dig> included  <dig> members in citrus species while in a. thaliana it contained only two proteins.

discussion
citrus is the main fruit tree crop in the world. however, traditional breeding for citrus cultivar improvement faces many serious impediments due to the unusual combination of biological characteristics of citrus, their low genetic diversity and the long-term nature of tree breeding. genomic technology can overcome these limitations providing new tools, for example, to produce more efficient varieties and rootstocks and to identify new genes, alleles or genotypes of agronomic relevance. improvement of knowledge of the transcriptome is one of the first tasks that have to be developed in order to understand the developmental biology of the plants and how these respond to environmental stresses. this work that pursues this goal provides a deep insight into the citrus transcriptome specifically related to three major commercial traits i.e improved fruit quality, higher yield and tolerance to environmental stresses, especially salinity.

towards this objective,  <dig> cdna libraries representing particular treatments and tissues from selected varieties and rootstocks differing in fruit quality, resistance to abscission and tolerance to salinity were generated to provide a large and enriched expressed sequence tag collection. the assembly of these sequences, more than  <dig> ests, allowed the identification of  <dig> transcription units. the results of this analysis are comparable to previous reports in solanum tuberosum, that detected  <dig> unigenes from  <dig> ests  <cit> , or in sorghum bicolor, with  <dig> unique transcripts derived from  <dig> ests  <cit> . the data showed that all sequences from the citrus species analyzed, from both this study and databases, were almost identical, suggesting that the differential behaviour of these cultivars during normal fruit growth or when facing environmental adverse conditions is more likely associated with differences in gene regulation rather than with sequence divergence. this result is not unexpected since citrus posses a high level of phenotypic diversity while global genetic diversity, analyzed with molecular markers, appears to be very low or practically null. a large effort was made to determine the real number of different transcripts represented in the est collection. it is well known that the accuracy of est clustering is affected by various error sources, such as sequencing mistakes, contaminant sequences and the presence of products of chimeric splicing. the most common error occurs when different ests from the same gene are falsely separated into two or more clusters  <cit> . to overcome this difficulty the level of redundancy was estimated comparing all unigenes with each other, and clustering them in supercontigs, that are more likely to correspond to real transcripts. the level of redundancy was estimated to be 26%, a value similar to that obtained in sugarcane, for example  <cit> . this first restriction suggests that the likely number of unigenes in the citrus collection is closer to  <dig> rather than to  <dig> 

it was also crucial to determine the occurrence of contaminant sequences, mostly from microorganisms, since many samples were taken from open field. the presence of contaminant sequences  is a general problem not attended in any of the est projects we have examined. for instances, a blastn search performed with several contaminant sequences found in this work against the viridiplantae section of the genbank est database revealed a considerable number of ests regarded as plant sequences that really corresponded to fungi species . thus, the analysis reported in this work may help to prevent the presence of sequences from contaminant species in the databases. determining the species of the unigenes best hit sequences helped to identify putative contaminants, allowing not only a more precise estimation of the real number of citrus transcripts but also criteria for microarray est selection. since about  <dig> unigenes were believed to be contaminant sequences from other species, the number of citrus expressed genes was reduced to  <dig> 

a relevant observation of this work is that more than 38% of the  <dig> unigenes  are novel citrus unigenes. est sequences were obtained from two kinds of cdna libraries, normalized full length and standard libraries. the normalized library was generated with a wide variety of reproductive and vegetative tissues, enriched with developing fruits, abscission zones and salinity samples. in the first strategy, the normalization process very effectively increased low abundant transcripts, since the bulk of the novel unigenes described  derived from this library. the standard libraries that were constructed from either samples of fruits, abscission zones or salt-treated organs, were generated with the idea of providing transcripts specifically expressed at these particular tissues and organs without increasing redundancy. to estimate the contribution of the standard libraries in terms of gene novelty, a set of unigenes presumably involved in the three processes of interest was selected and the libraries containing them identified. although for an accurate evaluation of these contributions confirmation of tissue specificity appears to be mandatory, these preliminary estimates showed that most of the novel genes were certainly recovered in the normalized library. moreover, the contribution of the specific standard libraries to the unigene set maybe roughly estimated to be between  <dig> and 15%.

the primary homology searches performed against different databases allowed annotation of most unigenes, with more than 73% of them displaying a similarity degree higher than 60%. these results agreed those obtained in previous citrus  <cit>  or sugarcane  <cit>  est projects. it was also shown that most of the sequences that did not produce significant hits in the blastx searches were shorter than  <dig> bp  and probably did not carry coding sequences. additional efforts were performed to characterize these sequences, with supplementary blastn searches against the non redundant and est nucleotide databases. these analyses gave rise to the suggestion that  <dig> ests of the citrus unigene set may correspond to citrus exclusive genes since the significant hits they produced were only for citrus sequences, in spite of the more than  <dig>  million est sequences derived from plant species deposited at the genbank,

further improvement of the annotation was carried out through searches performed against secondary databases, composed of patterns or signatures. although these prediction methods can work with dna sequences, the error prone nature of ests, mainly shifts in the reading frame  or ambiguous bases, may result in inaccuracies and loss of information. thus, a crucial step in annotation is the robust translation of the ests to yield predicted polypeptides. polypeptide sequences posses a better template for almost all annotation tools, including interpro and pfam, and allow the assembly of more accurate multiple sequence alignments. high quality polypeptide predictions can be applied to functional annotation and post-genomic study in a similar way to those available for completed genomes. in the work presented here, the protein translation was performed with prot4est, a prediction pipeline that incorporates freely available software  to produce final translations that are more accurate than those derived from any single method  <cit> . the use of the interproscan tool  <cit> , allowed simultaneous search for motifs against  <dig> databases. this search produced significant results for almost  <dig> predicted proteins, including  <dig> unigenes that did not have significant hits in the blast searches. from the  <dig> most abundant motifs found in citrus with pfam,  <dig> of them also were included in the top  <dig> list at the pfam database, enforcing the accuracy of the analysis and the representativity of the citrus est collection. the molecular functions associated with these  <dig> motifs can be grouped in  <dig> categories: protein-protein interaction , nucleic acid binding , protein modification and binding , and calcium metabolism , which indicates the relative significance of these cellular functions in citrus.

the distribution of motifs on the polypeptide sequences predicted to be complete proteins showed that the bulk of sequences displayed a single motif . proteins carrying  <dig> ore more motifs showed unlike signatures rather than repeats of the same motif. for instance, the number of proteins with  <dig> different signatures  was six times higher than the number of proteins that had  <dig> identical motifs . similar relationships were found for other number of repeats.

the gene ontology annotation of the citrus unigenes was performed with blast2go , a recently developed blast-based go annotation software  <cit> . the b2g approach uses multiple blast hits to search for functional annotations and assigns go terms to the query sequence applying an annotation algorithm that considers hsp length, e-value, percentage of similarity, evidence code of the source annotations and the topology of the gene ontology. this is in contrast to most est projects that perform annotation solely by direct assignment of the go terms to the best hit of blast searches  <cit> . the b2g method has shown to have a high annotation recall and has been used in other est projects in eukaryotes  <cit> .

metabolic pathways responsible of important agronomic traits were further surveyed to determine the extent of representation of these pathways within the citrus unigene set. in addition to the finding that most enzymatic steps were represented by citrus homologs, a preliminary estimate of gene duplication based on the occurrence of paralogous sequences was also provided. defining such relationships and understanding functional diversification of paralogs is an important field of research in genomics-assisted crop improvement. lignin biosynthetic pathway was the object of a deeper analysis since citrus fruits are very rich in products with beneficial effects in preventing cancer, diabetes, ...etc such as fiber  <cit> . dietary fiber, that consists of non digested structural and storage polysaccharides and lignin, lowers cholesterol levels and helps to normalize blood glucose and insulin levels  <cit> . the detailed analysis of lignin biosynthesis pathway, carried out in citrus, indicated that in comparison with arabidopis, citrus possessed at least  <dig> additional enzymatic activities involved in lignin synthesis . furthermore, the results obtained for gene models from populus trichocarpa  <cit> , also appears to support the idea that the extensive formation of secondary xylem in tree species, requiring high levels of lignin synthesis may have been the origin of the expansion of the genes involved in this pathway.

more than  <dig> unigenes have been suggested to be possible conserved orthologs of arabidopsis single copy genes. recent studies have indicated that ancient polyploidy is common across angiosperm lineages and in fact, the genomes of all angiosperms may have been influenced by at least one genome-wide duplication event  <cit> . despite such events, single-copy, apparently orthologous gene sets have been identified in a broad range of angiosperms  <cit> . selection against duplicates may be maintaining these genes as single copy, and therefore are precious markers for comparative genetic and physical mapping, and also for phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . identification of such genes in citrus species is mandatory to perform this kind of analyses  <cit> . the study also revealed a number of genes that might be duplicated in the citrus genome, while remained as single copy genes in arabidopsis, although the possibility of finding additional copies of these genes could not be discarded, when the whole transcriptome of citrus is available. if these duplications are the result of individual events or were caused by a genome-wide duplication cannot be answered with the current information.

comparative genomics was also used to obtain an overview of conserved gene families in citrus. all arabidopsis gene families studied were well represented in the citrus est collection, although the number of their members was generally smaller, probably because the unigene set was only a partial representation. for the same reason, the finding of families that in citrus clearly outnumbered their arabidopsis counterparts is highly significant. the phylogenomic analysis performed on the gene families of ammonium transporters and glycosyltransferases supported this idea confirming the occurrence of additional members in the citrus families. ammonium is one of the prevalent nitrogen sources for growth and development of higher plants including citrus. the ammonium transporter family is composed in arabidopsis of  <dig> amt <dig> related genes and amt <dig>  which is more closely related to ammonium transporters from prokaryotes than to amt <dig>  atamt <dig> is likely to play a significant role in moving ammonium between the apoplast and symplast of cells throughout the plant  <cit> . interestingly, there are three amt <dig> like genes in citrus . glycosyltransferases are a ubiquitous group of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of a sugar moiety from an activated sugar donor onto saccharide or non-saccharide acceptors. although many glycosyltransferases catalyse chemically similar reactions, they display remarkable diversity in their donor, acceptor and product specificity and thereby generate a potentially infinite number of glycoconjugates, oligo- and polysaccharides.  <cit> . thus, the additional members found in this family, might be related to the complexity of sugar synthesis that takes place in the citrus fruits.

CONCLUSIONS
the assembly of more than  <dig> citrus ests from five cultivars differing in basic fruit developmental aspects, such as major traits for fruit quality and production, and in the responses to environmental conditions, provides an unprecedented insight of the citrus transcriptome. this study contributes new tools for citrus genetic and genomic analyses. the unigene set, composed of ~ <dig> putative different transcripts, including more than  <dig> novel citrus genes, was assigned with putative functions based on similarity, go annotations and protein domains. in addition, comparative genomics was used to analyze the citrus transcriptome, and evidences for numerous cases of gene duplication events were presented. the similarity analyses indicated that the sequences of the genes belonging to the varieties and rootstocks studied were essentially identical suggesting that the differential behaviour of these species cannot be attributed to main sequence divergences. this set of processed est sequences has greatly contributed to the development of a new citrus microarray.
