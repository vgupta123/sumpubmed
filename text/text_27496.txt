BACKGROUND
plant species in arid zones are constantly exposed to drought stress  <cit> . tolerance to such water deficits most likely occurred in organisms like bryophyte mosses and was evolutionarily important during the conquest of land by plants  <cit> . proteins of the lea superfamily are part of the molecular response to this stressful environment  <cit>  and are classified into groups based on amino acid sequence motifs  <cit> . despite the various roles suggested for lea proteins, their precise functions have not been fully revealed.

the widespread  asr proteins  are considered to be a subgroup of the lea superfamily  <cit> . from an evolutionary standpoint, we previously reported the locus asr <dig> to have been a target of positive selection in dry habitats, at least in species of the solanum genus  <cit> . regarding biochemical function, the paralogous asr <dig>  cloned as long as  <dig> years ago   <cit> , encodes a 14-kda polypeptide  proposed to act as both a chaperone  <cit>  and a transcription factor   <cit> . however, no target genes from tomato have been reported for asr <dig> albeit at the beginning and even at completion of this work, two target genes from other species had been identified: i) a sugar transport gene in vitis vinifera   <cit>  and ii) abi <dig> in transgenic arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . given the complexity of the drought stress response in general  <cit> , we have long suspected that a great deal of targets exist in the large tomato genome, which contains as many as  <dig>  protein-coding genes  <cit> .

therefore, we were convinced that it was worthwhile pursuing the challenge to identify the direct target genes of asr <dig>  our regulator of interest, which is thought to control the downstream network necessary for cellular adjustment to water loss. we believed that knowledge on this particular “targetome” would generate valuable mechanistic insights into the genetic program leading to such a physiological adaptation. to achieve this goal, we carried out chip-sequencing , a strategy that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation  with massively parallel  dna sequencing to identify the in vivo binding sites of dna-associated proteins, including tfs. as it proved to be useful to map global binding sites precisely for any nuclear protein of interest believed to associate with chromatin, chip-seq has emerged as a powerful tool in eukaryotes, particularly in mammals, including humans  <cit> , and plants  <cit> . in this way and using a high-quality anti-asr <dig> antibody and advanced bioinformatics tools, we generated chip-seq data that allowed us to assemble a genome-wide high-resolution dna-binding map of asr <dig>  highlighting plant genes that appear to be logically associated with the drought stress response, namely those encoding aquaporins and those associated with the cell wall.

RESULTS
the size of the immunoprecipitated fragments  and quality assessment of the affinity-purified anti-asr <dig> antibody
after shearing dna through sonication of lysed nuclei, we determined the average size of the resulting dna fragments by means of gel electrophoresis. they were approximately 400 bp , a suitable size for input dna for subsequent chip and library construction.

after the asr <dig> protein was successful purified , an anti-asr <dig> antibody was raised in rabbits, affinity-purified and checked via a dot blot . the immunoprecipitation  ability of this polyclonal anti-asr <dig> antibody was tested by performing a preliminary ip assay followed by sds-page and a western blot. as expected, we were able to detect a clear single band corresponding to asr <dig>  both in samples precipitated with the specific antibody alone as well as in whole chromatin .

once the quality of the antibody and the size of the sheared dna fragments were assessed, we performed the chip protocol .

anti-asr <dig> chip followed by deep sequencing
we performed chip, using stressed tomato leaves as the starting tissue and purified anti-asr <dig> antibody for the ip assay. the recovered dna was subjected to high throughput sequencing on illumina hiseq  <dig> equipment. to identify immuno-enriched regions, we made use of the macs software program  <cit>  . macs generated a list of  <dig> regions enriched in the immunoprecipitated sample; the most statistically relevant are shown in table  <dig> . to corroborate the informatics analysis, the peaks were manually visualized using the integrative genomics viewer  genome browser  <cit>  . analysis was also performed with the software program cisgenome  <cit>  and the statistical package csar  <cit> , but these programs yielded false-positive peaks  and were thus not used for further analysis. the software program readingextension was used to extend the reads of the sam file from approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nt .

the  <dig> peaks that showed the highest statistical significance  as determined by macs  <cit>  are listed. for each peak, the tomato chromosome number, its boundaries in the sequence of the tomato genome  <cit> , the length and the score are indicated.

validation of the immuno-enriched sequences revealed by high throughput sequencing
to validate the accepted peaks resulting from our genome-wide approach, we performed qpcr designed to individually amplify several previously chip-enriched regions, chosen due to either the known function of the genes present in the peaks or a high statistical value . an additional peak-free region was used as a negative control. we used a duplicate of the sample subjected to deep sequencing as a dna template for pcr amplification, in addition to two other independent immunoprecipitates obtained under the same conditions. in all three samples, the five selected amplicons were found to be significantly enriched  when compared to the negative control st- <dig> .

the names and predicted functions of the asr1-immuno-enriched genes present in peaks. the non-enriched gene st- <dig> was used as a negative control.

overall bioinformatics analysis
once we confirmed that our chip data were reproducible and confident, we carried out a deeper inspection of the data. we observed that 70% of the  <dig> regions studied localize to gene-containing regions . we defined these “genic regions” as spanning from 3 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site to 1 kb downstream of the end of transcription. by further analyzing the peaks found within genes, we observed that 42% of them localized to the upstream regulatory region of the corresponding gene  and 45% of them localized to coding regions plus introns. the small remaining fraction  of peaks fell within 1 kb of the downstream sequences .

average distribution maps of leaf asr <dig> along the tomato genome upon stress
to get an overall picture of the distribution of asr <dig> binding along different gene zones, we constructed average distribution maps for target genes by using the software program “averagedistribution” . while the reads were evenly distributed amongst the promoter regions, the peaks were centered when present in exons or downstream regions .

sorting out asr <dig> target genes according to function
genes associated with asr <dig> were classified using the software program mapman  <cit> . the sorting was based on possible gene functions, mainly according to sequence homology and the presence of domains of known functions in other organisms. we observed a great diversity of gene groups involved with most of the cell functions . we also used mapman software to define which gene groups were significantly over-represented compared with their relative amount in the whole genome. over-represented categories included genes encoding cell wall-related proteins and major intrinsic proteins , as well as miscellaneous functions .

the abundance of these groups in our dataset versus their abundance in the tomato genome is shown. over-representation was calculated as the ratio between the % abundance in immunoprecipitated samples and the % abundance in the whole genome. statistical p-values are indicated.

identification of the consensus asr1-binding motif
the consensus asr1-binding motif was determined using the software program gimmemotif  <cit>  that identifies similar redundant motifs using a “weighted information content” based on similarity scores and clustering using an iterative procedure. using this computational tool, we found a robust consensus dna motif for asr <dig> . gimmemotif yielded several consensus sequences, and we chose the one with the best performance.

to assess performance, gimmemotif provides a roc curve  <cit>  that plots the number of true positives  as a function of false positives  . the performance is measured as the area below the roc curve , which ranges from  <dig>  for the lowest performance to  <dig> for perfect performance. the roc curve is obtained by using either a “genomic” background with the same dinucleotide frequency as the input values or a “random” matched background composed of genomic sequences randomly taken from a similar distance to the transcription start site as the input peaks  <cit> . finally, the software plotted the location of the obtained consensus motif relative to the center of each peak and showed that the obtained motif is predominantly located in the middle of the reads .

additionally, we used the software program "consensuscounter"  to determine that the frequency of the consensus motif in all peaks was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  compared with the  <dig>  × 10- <dig> frequency  expected by chance using the  <dig> % gc content in the tomato genome  <cit> .

the impact of asr <dig> binding on target gene expression
to determine whether the regulation of the obtained target genes is asr1-dependent, we compared the expression of two representative target genes in the leaves of asr1-silenced transgenic plants  after a 6-hr water stress treatment . silenced plants showed a marked decrease  in asr <dig> mrna in comparison with wt plants . when normalizing against the house-keeping gene ubi <dig>  the mrna levels of gene 10– <dig>  from both transgenic lines were significantly lower  in comparison with wt plants . on the other hand, the expression levels of gene 3– <dig>  were decreased only in one asr1-silenced line . similar results were obtained when mrna levels were normalized to ef- <dig>  a house-keeping gene .

these results, obtained with representatives of cell wall- and aquaporin-associated genes, indicate that the binding of asr <dig> to its target genes is truly productive and results in gene regulation upon the induction of water stress, confirming previous hints of asr <dig> being a direct transcriptional activator  <cit> .

the identified consensus motif sequence  was consistently found three times at the single exon of gene 10– <dig> and  <dig> times at the promoter of gene 3– <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
for our genome-wide analysis, we carefully followed the current guidelines for chip-seq  <cit>  and assessed the quality of the antibody and the robustness of our bioinformatics tools to interpret our high throughput dna sequencing results. our chip-seq data showed  <dig> peaks with different values of statistical significance. the results of chip-seq were also analyzed with cisgenome  <cit>  and csar  <cit> , but these results gave false peaks and were thus discarded. artifacts can arise because the annotated sequence of the tomato genome  <cit>  is not error-free, particularly regarding the copy number of repetitive elements and ribosomal genes, which may have been underestimated.

asr <dig> showed a binding preference  for gene regions, which is expected for a tf. considering that tomato genes  represent only approximately 13% of the whole genome   <cit> , this proportion is even more striking. when we performed a more in-depth analysis of the location of the immuno-enriched sequences that fell into the “gene region” category in the genome, we observed that the majority of them were either upstream of the genes or in the body of the genes, rather than 3’downstream of them. this was not surprising as it is widely accepted that regulatory regions can be found not only at 5’ upstream regions and sizeable distances from the coding region, but also within protein-coding exons as is the case of enhancers of zebra fish developmental genes  <cit> .

a comprehensive analysis of the target genes was made difficult by the diversity of functional categories  encountered. for this reason, we explored over-represented genes whose molecular or cellular functions seemed to be more influenced by asr <dig> a priori, for example, those encoding cell wall proteins and aquaporins , which are related to the physiological response to limited water accessibility  <cit> .

aquaporin genes belong to the major intrinsic protein  gene family. in plants, the number of aqp genes present in a single species is rather high, with more than  <dig> aqp genes frequently found in each genome  <cit> . plant aqps are classified into seven different subfamilies according to sequence similarity  <cit> . studies of aqp expression under drought stress have focused mainly on the pip  subfamily and have yielded opposite or conservative results, depending on the isoform analyzed  <cit> . some reports show that tips  and xips  subfamilies also modify their expression under abiotic stress  <cit> . the expression of tips has been observed in stomatal guard cells and is in agreement with their known role in drought stress  <cit> . one of the aqp genes we found as target of asr <dig> is an ortholog of atpip1; <dig> , frequently expressed in leaves and flowers. consistent with our results, this arabidopsis gene has been reported to be up-regulated during drought stress  <cit> . moreover, transcript levels of the tomato aquaporin gene solyc10g <dig>  were found lower in asr1-silenced plants compared to wt ones, thus validating the results of asr <dig> binding at a functional level. in agreement with an expected delay between tf binding and effective transcription due to chromatin remodeling  <cit> , such differences in expression were not detected at the  <dig> hours of stress chosen for the chip experiments but after  <dig> hours instead.

the plant cell wall provides structural support during development and represents the first line of defense against biotic and abiotic stressors, including drought. in recent years, evidence has accumulated for a dedicated maintenance mechanism for plant cell integrity under diverse biotic and abiotic stress; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. thus, the discovery of cell wall-related genes as targets of asr <dig> makes sense in light of the complex network of polymers essential for maintaining turgor pressure. water loss in this matrix results in a severe disruption of cell wall integrity, which can be irreversible  <cit> . in addition, because turgor pressure is fundamental to plant cell growth  <cit> , it is conceivable that tissues in active growth  make their walls more extensible, while other tissues  harden, allowing for continuous growth under low water potentials  <cit> . it is interesting that the “cell wall” gene group we identified includes genes involved in cellulose synthesis, cell wall breakdown and remodeling.

in particular, we found that asr <dig> binds directly to several cell wall-related genes. one such gene is solyc08g <dig> . <dig>  which is annotated as a cellulose synthase-like  protein. the three closest genes related to solyc08g <dig> . <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana are the paralogous cellulose synthase-like g  proteins  <dig>  and  <dig> , which contain a relatively high degree of identity  in the region between aa 26– <dig> . by searching the genevestigator platform , we found that atcslg2/g <dig> appear to be active during leaf senescence and that osmotic or water stress stimulates their expression up to 50-fold.

another cell wall-associated gene that emerged as a direct target of asr <dig> is solyc03g <dig> . <dig>  which is annotated as glucan endo- <dig> -β-glucosidase  <dig>  the closest ortholog in arabidopsis thaliana is the plasmodesmata callose-binding protein  <dig>  gene, with a high degree of identity . atpdcb <dig> exhibits specific callose-binding activity in vitro and localizes to plasmodesmata  <cit> . deposition of callose  at plasmodesmata is known to be stimulated by physical and physiological stresses  <cit> . interestingly, the genevestigator database reveals that the expression of atpdcb <dig> is highest in seeds during desiccation and stratification, reinforcing the concept of a conserved response of this kind of proteins to restricted water availability in both arabidopsis and tomato.

another work seeking targets of tomato asr <dig> was able to identify abi <dig>  a gene involved in seed germination  <cit> . however, this study suffers from the fact that it has been conducted in transgenic arabidopsis, with a smaller genome, thus missing many possible target genes.

our results also revealed a consensus in vivo asr-binding dna motif with little variation: gccca, almost identical to the one very recently found for asr <dig> in rice subjected to aluminium stress  <cit>  and to the one described for the tf attcp <dig>  <cit>  , whose targets are cytochrome genes in arabidopsis <cit> . it is thus tempting to speculate that attcp <dig> may function as the counterpart to asr <dig> in arabidopsis, which would be consistent with the known connection between adaptation to abiotic stress and oxidative respiration through mitochondrial electron transport in plants  <cit> . interestingly, we also identified four target paralogous genes of asr <dig> encoding cytochrome p <dig>  a related cytochrome p <dig> functioning as an aba-8’-hydroxylase is known to inactivate aba  <cit> , a paradigmatic plant hormone involved in the response to drought stress. because aba induces asr <dig> expression and the mentioned enzyme catalyzes the first step in the oxidative degradation of aba, asr <dig> might regulate aba endogenous levels in a feedback fashion under water stress situations.

the asr1-binding dna sequence was compared to four different databases using the stamp program  <cit> . columns show the databases used for comparison, the tfs possessing similar binding sites, the statistical e values and the alignments between the asr <dig> consensus sequence found in this study  as well as for the other tfs  for each hit, respectively. single letter codes for more than one nucleotide at ambiguous positions are the same as recommended in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/staff/tao/tools/tool_lettercode.html. all of the computer programs compared both plus and minus strands. asr <dig> showed a binding sequence almost identical to the one described for siteiiatcytc .

in addition, the motif we found shows partial coincidence with the one obtained by selex  <cit> . it is noteworthy that while chip captures sequences in vivo, selex is carried out in vitro with adn devoid of histones, an artificial condition. on the other hand, our chip data shows no enrichment of promoters/enhancers of genes orthologous to grape vvht <dig>  a sugar transporter gene reported to be a target of asr  <cit> . this result is consistent with the absence of the consensus motif in vvht <dig> and its presence—repeatedly up to eight times—in genomic regions highly enriched by chip. here, it is important to note that  <cit>  used a heterologous system  to test a plant protein-dna interaction and that neither the grape asr protein nor the vvht <dig> gene are identical to their counterparts in tomato.

at this point, it is worth mentioning the scope of chip in general. this procedure, due to its crosslinking step, is also able to detect proteins indirectly binding to dna, for example by forming a dna-interacting complex. nevertheless, even in this second scenario, the information gained by chip is useful. the way to discriminate between direct and indirect binding is to perform in vitro assays with the purified tf, in this case asr <dig>  at the expense of losing the in vivo context , which has already been performed  <cit> .
