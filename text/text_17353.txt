BACKGROUND
the chloroplast  genome has long been a focus of research in plant molecular evolution and systematics due to its small size, high copy number, conservation and extensive characterization at the molecular level  <cit> . more recently, with technical advances in dna sequencing, the number of completely sequenced cp genomes has grown rapidly. aside from providing information on genome structure, gene content, gene order and nucleotide composition, complete cp genome sequences also offer a unique opportunity to explore the evolutionary changes of the genome itself. in general, cp genomes are structurally highly conserved across land plants. however, structural rearrangements, e.g. gene loss, inverted repeat  loss or expansion and inversion, do occur in certain lineages and have been shown to be extremely informative in resolving deep phylogenetic relationships because they may exhibit less homoplasy than sequence data  <cit> . for example, a 30-kb inversion shared by all vascular plants except lycopsids identifies the lycopsids as the basal lineage in the vascular plants  <cit> . two inversions and an ir expansion can be used to clarify basal nodes in the leptosporangiate ferns  <cit> .

currently, one limiting factor in comparative chloroplast genomics is the sparse taxon sampling in spore-bearing land plants. the representation of genome sequencing almost always favors plants of economic interest  <cit> . complete cp genomes have been sequenced for more than one hundred seed plants. amongst these, more than  <dig> completed sequences each are from cereals , crucifers  and conifers  respectively . but for other land plants, excluding seed plants, only  <dig> cp genome sequences have been achieved in total, of which only  <dig> are from ferns prior this study . for further insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cp genome organization, more data from plant species representative of other crucial evolutionary nodes is needed  <cit> .

ferns , with more than  <dig>  living species, are the most diverse group of seed-free vascular plants  <cit> . previous studies have uncovered considerable genomic rearrangements in fern cp genomes, but the details and exact series of these events have not yet been fully characterized  <cit> . the completed cp genome sequence of the polypod fern adiantum capillus-veneris shows some unusual features not seen in vascular plants before, including trna gene losses, which had only been observed in cp genomes of non-photosynthetic plants  <cit> . for example, a putative trna-selenocysteine  gene in adiantum  <cit>  replaces the typical trnr-ccg gene. unfortunately, because adiantum is the only sequenced representative of leptosporangiates, the most diverse fern lineage, it is difficult to tell which characteristics are unique to adiantum or diagnostic of a much larger clade. therefore, complete cp genome data from more fern clades are necessary to better resolve these issues.

as part of an effort to shed more light on the cp genome evolution in ferns, we have sequenced the complete plastid genome of a scaly tree fern alsophila spinulosa  . this taxon was chosen because it is an easily available representative of an ancient lineage – tree ferns, for which no cp genome has been sequenced before. in addition to tree ferns, heterosporous and polypod ferns are the other two main lineages within the "core leptosporangiates"  <cit> . the three major lineages of "core leptosporangiates" were thought to have originated from a late triassic diversification  <cit> . recent phylogenetic studies further demonstrated a sister relationship between tree ferns and polypods  <cit> . after the late triassic diversification, polypods remarkably re-diversified along with angiosperms in the cretaceous  <cit> . similarly, the scaly tree ferns  also radiated very recently and diversified at an exceptionally high rate  <cit> . a comparison of the complete cp genome sequences between alsophila and the polypod fern adiantum will aid interpretation of unusual characters observed in adiantum, such as some missing and novel genes  <cit> .

moreover, sequences of all four published fern cp genomes  will enable more detailed comparisons of the organization and evolution of the chloroplast genomes in ferns. our comparative analyses corroborate that fern cp genomes have undergone substantial changes in gene orders during evolution: two main rearrangements contribute to major differences between "higher" and basal ferns. in addition, the comparisons also identify some unique characteristics in the alsophila cp genome including a novel trna, interesting pseudogenes and a highly repeated 565-bp-region spanning one endpoint of an ancient inversion.

RESULTS
general features
the chloroplast  genome of alsophila spinulosa  is  <dig>  base pairs  with a large single copy  region of  <dig>  bp separated from a  <dig> -bp small single copy  region by two inverted repeats , each of  <dig>  bp . the genome is the largest amongst the four sequenced fern cp genomes , but is smaller than previous estimates of other cyatheaceae species, e.g. alsophila bryophila , cyathea furfuracea  and sphaeropteris cooperi , using the mapping method  <cit> . when the ir is considered only once, the alsophila cp genome contains  <dig> genes, encoding  <dig> proteins,  <dig> rrnas and  <dig> trnas . pseudogenes of ycf <dig> and trnt-ugu were also detected in this genome . more than half of the alsophila cp genome is composed of coding regions  with the protein-coding regions accounting for the major portion  followed by rrna genes  and trna genes  .

a the genes in irs were considered only once

b trnsec was counted here according to the annotation in genbank and the reference  <cit> 

the alsophila cp genome has an overall gc content of  <dig> %, which is lower only than adiantum capillus-veneris amongst the four sequenced fern cp genomes  and is the fourth highest amongst sequenced land plant cp genomes . like other land plants  <cit> , gc content is unevenly distributed across the alsophila cp genome by location, functional group and codon position. the gc content in rrna genes  and trna genes  is much higher than in protein coding regions . the gc percentage in irs is the highest , reflecting the high gc content of rrna genes. amongst the protein genes, photosynthetic genes possess the highest gc content , followed by genetic system genes , whilst nadh genes have the least . the gc content also varies by codon position with the first  > second  > third  position in turn.

the start codons of  <dig> protein genes were inferred by comparisons with previously annotated land plant cp genomes. sixty-three of these genes start with aug,  <dig> with acg and  <dig> with gug . an acg codon may be restored to a canonical start codon  by rna editing, whereas a gug initiation codon has been reported in other cp genomes  <cit> . inferring translation start positions based only on genome sequences is merely hypothetical  <cit> . future determination of sequences from complementary dna  and/or proteins will help to substantiate the putative translation start positions as well as rna editing sites.

there are in total  <dig>  codons in all protein coding regions  , representing the total coding capacity of the alsophila cp genome; of these,  <dig>  are for leucine,  <dig>  for serine,  <dig>  for isoleucine, and  <dig>  for glycine. one third of the total codons are represented by these four amino acids. the codon usage of the alsophila cp genome reflects an apparent at bias. most codons end in a or u . as shown in figure  <dig>  both codon numbers and rscu  values are negatively correlated with codon gc content . it appears that nucleotide composition bias has a significant influence on codon usage.

gene order
the alsophila cp genome shares three key inversions with other ferns relative to bryophytes : 1) a 30-kb inversion at the beginning of lsc   <cit> ; 2) an approximately  <dig> kb inversion involving trnt, psbd, psbc, trns, psbz and trng  <cit> ; and 3) a minor inversion containing a single gene trnd-guc. the first of these inversions is also shared by all vascular plants except lycophytes, whereas the latter two are restricted to ferns.

to our knowledge, the trnd-guc inversion has not been previously documented. three conserved and consecutive trna genes, trnd-guc, trny-gua and trne-uuc, have been identified in all land plant cp genomes. excluding ferns, the three genes have the same directions of transcription. however, in ferns trnd is inverted relative to trny and trne . the simplest interpretation of this change is a single minor inversion involving only trnd. based on current data, it remains unknown whether the 3-kb inversion or the trnd inversion occurred first in ferns.

overall, the alsophila cp genome shows a high degree of synteny with the previously sequenced cp genome of adiantum . in contrast, there exist striking differences between alsophila and angiopteris  as well as between alsophila and psilotum . a set of complex rearrangements in the irs, involving a rare duplication of psba gene, was found in "higher" ferns using physical mapping  <cit> . the ir gene orders of "higher" ferns, such as adiantum, cyathea and polystichum, are highly rearranged in comparison to that of basal leptosporangiate osmunda  <cit> . complete cp genome data from angiopteris, psilotum, adiantum and alsophila detail these rearrangements. the ir gene order in alsophila appears to be the same as that in adiantum, while angiopteris and psilotum have the osmunda gene order. to explain the complex rearrangements, a "two inversions" hypothesis was proposed  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the great gene order changes within these rearrangements and the updated version of the "two inversions" model incorporating gene order data from the alsophila and angiopteris cp genomes. recently, wolf and roper  <cit>  indicated that the two major inversions did occur in turn and the second inversion  took place on the branch leading to the common ancestor of the heterosporous fern clade and its sister group. thus, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the adiantum gene order represents a common feature of the three lineages within core leptosporangiates .

interestingly, in the adiantum cp genome, an intron-containing trnt-ugu was identified between trnr-acg and ndhb   <cit> . the alsophila cp genome possesses no intact intron-containing trnt. however, two fragments that are similar to the two exons within the adiantum trnt were annotated as a Ψtrnt-ugu in this study . this new trnt or Ψtrnt is just at one endpoint of the inversion ii . therefore, the generation of intron-containing trnt-ugu may be associated with the ir rearrangements.

alsophila and adiantum share another rearranged region between rpob and psbz in lsc relative to angiopteris and psilotum . for the latter two, gene order in this region is "rpob-trnc-petn-psbm-trnd-trny-trne-trng-psbz", whereas in alsophila and adiantum it is "rpob-trnd-trny-trne-psbm-petn-trnc-trng-psbz"  . roper et al.  <cit>  noted that this gene order change is not caused by a single inversion. two alternative pathways may account for this rearrangement , but more data are needed to determine the order of the two inversions.

gene content
a total of  <dig> different genes are present in the alsophila cp genome . this gene content is similar to that of most land plants  <cit> . however, there are some interesting differences amongst the four sequenced fern cp genomes . the alsophila cp genome possesses the least number of trna genes due to  <dig> missing trna genes in comparison to basal ferns . its protein gene number is equal to that of angiopteris, but higher than that of both adiantum and psilotum. details of these differences are discussed below.

novel trna gene
a unique trnr-ucg gene, encoding trna-arg, is found between rbcl and accd in the alsophila cp genome . another type of trna-arg gene trnr-ccg resides in the same locus in non-flowering land plants including angiopteris  <cit>  and psilotum  <cit> . in adiantum, an apparent trna gene is annotated as trnsec  <cit> . it is uncertain whether the occurrence of trnr-ucg in the alsophila cp genome represents a unique feature for this species or is an apomorphy for a larger clade such as cyatheaceae or tree ferns. to address this question, we collected all fern rbcl-accd intergenic sequences deposited in genbank and examined the trna genes within them using aragorn  <cit> . the results indicate that trnr-ucg is restricted to tree ferns, whereas trnr-ccg is widespread in non-core leptosporangiates and basal ferns . however, neither trnr-ucg nor the trnr-ccg gene is identified at this locus in polypod ferns. therefore, the existence of trnr-ucg may reflect a putative molecular apomorphy of tree ferns.

a all sequence data were obtained from genbank at march  <dig>  2009;

b group names at ordinal level follow smith et al.  <cit> ;

c trna genes were identified by using aragorn v <dig>   <cit> 

sequence alignment indicates that trnr-ucg and trnr-ccgs have quite similar primary sequences with  <dig> of  <dig> nucleotides unchanged across  <dig> representative land plants . in addition, the adiantum trnsec shares  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> identical nucleotides with the alsophila trnr-ucg, the psilotum trnr-ccg and the angiopteris trnr-ccg respectively . due to their similarities and conserved loci, we propose that alsophila trnr-ucg, adiantum trnsec as well as trnr-ccgs in other land plants are orthologous. tree fern trnr-ucg can transfer arginine even though its anticodon alters from ccg to ucg. however, adiantum trnsec has undergone major changes: 1) its anticodon is uca , and 2) it contains up to  <dig> nucleotide differences relative to all other land plant trnr genes . our findings imply that the trnr-ucg is derived from the trnr-ccg by the alteration of one anticodon base; then the adiantum trnsec evolves from the trnr-ucg by altering one anticodon base further, becoming a trnr-ucg pseudogene . if this is the case, the adiantum trnsec should be annotated as Ψtrnr. sugiura and sugita  <cit>  argued that the trnr-ccg is not essential for plastid function although it is conserved in non-flowering plants. the evolutionary scenario of trnr-ccg in ferns  tends to support this view.

at the locus between rps <dig> and ndhj, the alsophila and adiantum cp genomes encode a trnl-caa  rather than a trnl-uaa gene . however, they lose another trnl-caa gene , which is found at the 3' downstream of ndhb in almost all other land plant plastid genomes. consequently, alsophila and adiantum only possess the trnl-caa, whereas the angiopteris and psilotum cp genomes contain both the trnl-uaa and the trnl-caa. in the adiantum chloroplast, the missing trnl-uaa could be provided for the heavily used uua codon by a partial c-to-u edit in the trnl-caa anticodon  <cit> . since the uua is also a preferred leucine codon for the alsophila cp genome , the same editing event might occur in the alsophila chloroplast as well.

missing trna gene
only  <dig> trna genes are encoded in the alsophila cp genome, whereas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are annotated in adiantum, angiopteris and psilotum, respectively . for cp genomes, it is believed that a set of  <dig> trna species is sufficient for the translation of chloroplast mrnas  <cit> . in the angiopteris and psilotum chloroplasts, trnas can read all codons by using two-out-of-three and wobble mechanisms  <cit> . however, in alsophila and adiantum chloroplasts, both lysine codons lack a corresponding trna-lys  . the loss of trnk suggests cytosolic trnas may be imported into chloroplasts, despite a lack of experimental evidence  <cit> . as an incidental consequence of the trnk loss, the matk open reading frame  is not nested in the trnk intron .

apart from the trnk and the trnl-caa, the alsophila cp genome also shares other  <dig> trna gene losses, including the trns-cga, the trnv-gac and the trnt-ugu , with adiantum relative to basal ferns angiopteris and psilotum . the shared absence of trna genes between alsophila and adiantum suggests that they may derive from a common ancestor.

protein genes
the alsophila cp genome contains a psam gene encoding photosystem i reaction center subunit m. this gene has been detected in psilotum  <cit>  and angiopteris  <cit> , but not in adiantum  <cit>  . besides ferns, psam also exists in bryophytes, lycophytes and gymnosperms, but not in angiosperms, implying its independent loss in ferns and angiosperms  <cit> . alsophila and adiantum represent tree ferns and polypods, respectively. due to their sister relationship, we speculate that the loss of psam in ferns occurred after the split of polypods and tree ferns.

a putative pseudogene of ycf <dig> is identified in the alsophila cp genome . the 5' ends of its two exons are both destroyed. in the four sequenced fern cp genomes, only angiopteris contains an intact ycf <dig> gene  <cit> . for other land plants, this gene only occurs in marchantia polymorpha , physcomitrella patens subsp.patens ,syntrichia ruralis  and huperzia lucidula . the findings suggest that ycf <dig> is lost independently in multiple clades of land plants including hornworts, ferns and seed plants.

inversion endpoint as hotspot for repeats
a total of  <dig> pairs of repeats  were identified in the alsophila cp genome by using reputer  <cit> , of which  <dig> are direct and  <dig> are inverted repeats. this number of repeats is less than are found in some highly rearranged cp genomes  but more than are present in unrearranged ones   <cit> . up to  <dig> direct repeats  are restricted to a region spanning only  <dig> bp  between trnr-acg and ψtrnt-ugu in the irs . the gc content of this 565-bp-region  is lower than that of irs and the overall gc content of the whole genome. detailed sequence analyses revealed that this region is composed of tandem iterations of  <dig> similar segments ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . the core repeated motif is aaaatcctagtagttagagctttatccagggtataggact  with variant lengths of heads and/or tails .

in contrast to alsophila, dispersed repeats  are rare in the adiantum cp genome, with only  <dig> short inverted repeats ; and none of these occurs between the trnr-acg and the trnt-ugu. in the alsophila cp genome, the length of the intergenic region between trnr-acg and ψtrnt-ugu is  <dig> bp, whereas in adiantum it is  <dig> bp, the difference being  <dig> bp. we noted that this length is very similar to that of the highly repeated 565-bp-region, and speculate that the difference is caused by the presence of the highly repeated region. to test this hypothesis, we extracted the sequence from trnr-acg to ψtrnt-ugu in alsophila and from trnr-acg to trnt-ugu in adiantum. the sequence alignment indicates that the highly repeated 565-bp-region is indeed lost in the adiantum cp genome .

in the alsophila cp genome, the location of the highly repeated 565-bp-region is exactly at the endpoint of the second inversion of the ir rearrangements . dispersed repeated sequences have been reported from several cp genomes. these are associated with numerous dna rearrangements, particularly inversions  <cit> . in extensively rearranged cp genomes, the endpoints of rearranged gene clusters are usually flanked by repeated sequences  <cit> . if repeat-mediated recombination is the major mechanism generating inversions in cp genomes  <cit> , the preservation of repeats would destabilize the genome structure. after inversions, the repeats should be deleted to guarantee genome stability . the repeats observed at the endpoint of the ancient inversion  may be a vestige of recent rearrangement that are undiscovered. the existence of these repeats implies that the region is a potential hotspot for genomic reconfiguration.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present the first complete cp genome sequence from a tree fern and provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of cp genomes in ferns. the cp genome size of alsophila is larger than that of adiantum, psilotum and angiopteris. besides  <dig> genes, two pseudogenes Ψycf <dig> and Ψtrnt-ugu are also detected in the alsophila cp genome. an intact ycf <dig> is identified in angiopteris, while an intron-containing trnt-ugu is found in adiantum. based on the findings, we speculate that Ψycf <dig> reflects an intermediate during ycf <dig> gene loss, and the genesis of trnt-ugu may be associated with the ir rearrangements. a trnr-ucg gene was detected between rbcl and accd in alsophila, and this seems to be a molecular apomorphy of tree ferns. in the adiantum cp genome, the trnr-ucg gene degenerates to a pseudogene. the alsophila cp genome shares several unusual characteristics with the previously sequenced adiantum  cp genome, such as five missing trna genes and two major rearranged regions. these common characters probably derive from their common ancestor. in the alsophila cp genome, a highly repeated 565-bp-region, which is composed of tandem iterations of  <dig> similar segments, occurs at one endpoint of an ancient inversion, but it is not detected in the genome of adiantum. nonetheless, the origin and function of these repeats remain to be characterized in future studies.
