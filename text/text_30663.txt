BACKGROUND
quantitative real-time pcr  has by far been the most widely used method for the measurement of transcript abundance. the method is applicable across most tissues and targets of interest, sensitive, relatively inexpensive and quick compared to northern blotting. most importantly, when employed appropriately, it allows for accurate quantification over a wide dynamic range of template amounts.

however, the level of accuracy depends upon various factors. the integrity of rna contained in the original sample, storage conditions, the efficacy of various reagents and enzymes used in rna extraction, purification, reverse transcription and the actual qpcr, and the type of thermal cycler used are examples of factors that affect the accuracy of qpcr data. in order to take these sources of variation into account, an internal control  is commonly used  <cit> .

reference genes need to have uniform transcript abundance across the different groups being compared . as such, normalizing transcripts abundance of target genes over that of a reference gene should, in theory, eliminate artifactual variation. it is clear however, that to date, not a single universal reference gene has been found, if it even exists at all  <cit> . very often, genes that are stably expressed between treatments in one study system are found to be regulated in another. as such, careful consideration must be given to selecting and validating candidate reference genes  <cit> .

more recently, many studies have employed a combination of multiple reference genes as normalizers  <cit> . this method commonly utilizes software packages, e.g., genorm  <cit> , bestkeeper  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit> , that are specifically designed to determine the most stable normalizer  amongst a set of candidates, and/or the most stable combination of genes based on their geometric averages. it is argued that the variation in the geometric average of several acceptably stable genes is usually smaller than that of any one of those genes alone, thus increasing normalizer stability  <cit> . unfortunately, most of these studies only mention which genes are considered best by the software without validating if the genes are 'good enough'.

at the heart of the issue for most researchers, is whether or not reference genes are differentially regulated between compared groups   <cit> . in this study, we will illustrate the importance of validating the outcomes of these three reference gene selection programs. we do this by testing the transcript levels or normalization factor values  of software-selected reference genes for differences between sample groups using traditional non-parametric statistics  and rest  <dig> . rest  <dig> is a software application specifically created to statistically test qpcr data for pairwise differences between groups. for our purpose, we use the new zealand shortfinned eel  as our study system.

freshwater eels  are catadromous teleosts that spawn in the deep-ocean  <cit> . the current study will evaluate the suitability of six candidate reference genes  for qpcr analysis in the new zealand shortfinned eel. we examined the stability of mrna abundance of candidate reference genes in two tissue types  between three groups of fish: juvenile sedentary  eels, migrating adult eels  and 11-ketotestosterone  implanted yellow eels . we chose to compare these three groups due to our research interests regarding the transformation of yellow to silver eels . silvering involves systemic changes to the physiology, morphology and behavior of eels, a necessary step before final sexual maturation and migration  <cit> . it is now well known that exogenous 11-kt implantation of yellow eels induces morphological and physiological changes consistent with silvering, in particular liver and ovary enlargement, and sexual development  <cit> . three candidate genes were selected due to their common usage as references in many study systems  and the remaining three because of our prediction that their mrna levels should be stable due to their 'housekeeping' roles . using three software applications , we will determine the best reference gene candidate based on overall transcript stability and across the three groups. we will also validate these selected genes statistically and evaluate for differences between seasons. to our knowledge, this study is the first to formally select suitable reference genes for an anguillid fish and to subject the suitability of software-selected genes to scrutiny in any teleost.

RESULTS
qpcr assay validations
all qpcr assays except that for eef <dig> of  <dig> ovary samples  had amplification efficiencies between 95% and 105%, and r <dig> values of ≥  <dig> . all qpcr assays produced a single amplicon as shown by single peaks during melting curve analyses. the identities of qpcr products were further confirmed through sequencing.

analyses of transcription stability
examination of threshold cycle  values showed considerable variability among the different candidate reference genes , with different patterns between liver and ovary. the most stable and variable genes in the liver were  <dig> s and odc <dig>  respectively, and in the ovary, actb and 18s, respectively. based on the m value calculated in genorm, mrna levels of all candidate genes except  <dig> s were more stable in the ovary than liver, a pattern that is replicated when calculated by normfinder based on stability value . in general, the rankings obtained by genorm and bestkeeper correspond well with those based on this cursory analyses of overall mrna levels . certain genes showed strong indications of being regulated, such as actb and odc <dig> in the liver and  <dig> s in the ovary .

for liver samples, there is a broad agreement among the three programs, particularly between genorm and bestkeeper . thus,  <dig> s was consistently the top-ranked or part of the top-ranked pair of genes while odc <dig> was consistently the worst or second-worst performing gene for liver and ovary. genorm and bestkeeper gave identical decreasing ranking order for l <dig>  nop <dig>  actb and odc <dig>  genorm and bestkeeper also selected eef <dig> as the second best and part of the best pair of genes, but eef <dig> was considered the second worst by normfinder.

*genorm does not select the single best gene but the best pair of genes.

rankings were based on overall transcription stability parameters as calculated by genorm , bestkeeper,  or that calculated by a model based approach by normfinder . high transcript abundance of  <dig> s may make it unsuitable as a reference gene, therefore where  <dig> s had been selected by genorm as part of the best pair of genes, an additional analysis was conducted without  <dig> s . values in boxed parentheses  indicate indices of stability of the top ranked gene or pair of genes, or the second highest if the top ranked gene was 18s. lower scores denote greater transcription stability and suitability as a reference gene. both genorm and normfinder select the best pair combination of reference genes.

for ovary samples, there is only a moderate agreement between the three programs . actb was ranked in the top half by all programs, and nop <dig> in the top two selected by bestkeeper and normfinder. in the ovary samples,  <dig> s is consistent in being the worst or second-worst performing gene

validation of reference genes
statistical analyses based on rest  <dig> and mann-whitney provided virtually identical conclusions, with the only exception being those for  <dig> s liver on  <dig> data . indeed, mann-whitney and rest  <dig> showed a significant and not-significant difference between yellow and silver groups, respectively.

*  <dig> s can only be considered the best for  <dig> liver with qualifications as mann-whitney test showed significant difference between yellow and silver groups.

the top ranked candidate reference genes as selected by genorm, bestkeeper and normfinder were validated using rest  <dig>  and mann-whitney. to reduce type ii error, differences are considered significant at p ≤  <dig>  . significant difference between any two groups indicates unsuitability as reference genes due to lack of stability across groups. figures in bold denote the best reference gene based on inter-group stability. the second best option is also denoted in bold when the best included  <dig> s . the best or second best reference gene were applied to the  <dig> data. where it performs poorly , the programs were used to select the top ranked candidate gene based on  <dig> data, with the statistical validation of the results also shown above.

most of the genes or pairs of genes selected by the three programs were not sufficiently stable among liver samples, showing strong regulation with treatment  or developmental stage  . only the eef1- <dig> s combination and eef <dig> by itself were sufficiently stable across the three groups, and no significant pairwise differences were detected by rest  <dig> or mann-whitney . as indicated by the higher p values in two pairwise comparisons, the eef1- <dig> s combination is more stable than eef <dig> by itself. however, the high transcript abundance of  <dig> s may render it unsuitable as reference for lowly expressed genes. in these cases, eef <dig> would be a suitable reference.

for ovary, all of the genes or pairs of genes selected by the programs were sufficiently stable to act as references, except for nop <dig> which seems to be down-regulated in silver eels . among the selected reference genes, a single gene - l <dig> - was shown to perform best in terms of stability by yielding the lowest probability of a statistical difference between two pairwise comparisons.

the best reference genes identified from  <dig> data were applicable for  <dig> data for both liver and ovary . the  <dig> eef1- <dig> s combination for liver and l <dig> for ovary were suitable for use as reference genes. however, we found significant differences in two sets of pairwise comparisons for liver eef <dig>  making it unsuitable as a reference gene on this data set. to find out if any other reference genes are suitable, we ran the reference gene selection programs on the  <dig> liver data and validated the selection statistically. the results indicated that  <dig> s used as a single reference gene was the only other viable option for  <dig> liver samples, as validated by rest  <dig>  however, it should be noted that mann-whitney analyses showed a significant difference in  <dig> s mrna levels between yellow and silver groups.

discussion
in this study, we have for the first time selected reference genes that are suitable for use in qpcr of ovarian and liver samples from an anguillid eel. our results show that for studies on the silvering of freshwater eels and the involvement of 11-kt in this event, the transcript levels for l <dig> and the combination of eef <dig> and  <dig> s are suitable for use as references in ovary and liver tissues, respectively. more importantly, we have for the first time demonstrated a method to validate the conclusions made by reference gene selection programs. indeed, our validation method has surprisingly shown that a single gene  can perform better in terms of intergroup stability than a combination of genes.

due to the widespread use of qpcr, it is unsurprising that reference gene selection programs are commonly used and form a critical element of publication of qpcr data. however, this study has highlighted several reasons for why external validations of the conclusions drawn from such programs are needed.

first, just as there is no single universal reference gene, no single program could provide the optimal reference genes for all situations. as can be expected from the different algorithms and assumptions employed, the three programs often do not agree on the best gene or rankings of genes  <cit> . the optimal gene for liver and ovary, and even liver itself between seasons, were selected by different programs. we highly recommend that researchers interested in computer-assisted reference gene selection use multiple programs. it is encouraging that this approach has been adopted by many similar studies  <cit> .

second, the optimal reference genes selected by a program can only be as good as their candidates. in our case, ovary had greater overall transcript stabilities than liver for all but one gene . this is consistent with our findings that most program-selected reference genes performed satisfactorily for ovary, while the opposite was found for liver where only two out of six selected genes passed statistical validation.

third, differences in study design or context may affect the performance of reference genes, even within the same species. in this study, we show that year and season affected the performance of eef <dig> as a reference gene. it performed satisfactorily for samples taken in summer  <dig> but showed a strong effect of treatment in the autumn  <dig>  changes in reference gene suitability due to differences in study design  or developmental stage have been reported in many studies . thus researchers need to be vigilant in validating the reference genes used in every study.

all three potential problems described above could be mitigated by using an independent statistical validation method. rest  <dig> was written by the same group that produced bestkeeper, and its conclusions very closely matched the independent mann-whitney tests which strongly suggest that it is a suitable validating program. we therefore, recommend the use of rest  <dig> because its specific design for qpcr data analysis circumvents the difficulties of parametric statistical analyses on data based on proportions, such as those generated by qpcr  <cit> . however, other methods of qpcr data analyses are available  and may be equally or more suitable, such as when analyses other than pair-wise comparisons are required.

there has been a realization that a great number of publications of qpcr data do not include sufficient information to allow for evaluation of reliability of the results  <cit> . one of the key description pertains to the selection of reference genes , yet, this information is often not provided. fewer still indicate whether or not reference genes are stably transcribed across the compared groups, with many simply citing previous research that used the same genes in a similar study system. our findings convincingly show that such approaches are inadequate as a matter of due diligence.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that all reporting of normalized qpcr data include the following information: 1) justification/rationale for the selection of the reference genes used , and 2) whether or not the mrna levels of reference genes are different between the experimental groups.
