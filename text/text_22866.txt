BACKGROUND
according to the newest interpretation of c <dig> calibration data, and according to previous studies on human evolution, europe was populated around 41– <dig> thousand years ago   <cit> . the main features of the post-glacial colonization of europe was reliably reconstructed using parts of the human mitochondrial genome  or the entire mtdna molecule  <cit> .

in europe, with the exception of u <dig> and v, which most likely arose in situ, all mtdna hgs  are most likely of middle eastern origin and were introduced by either the protocolonization 41– <dig> kya, by later arrivals in the late paleolithic or more recent contacts  <cit> .

nearly half of the west eurasian pool of human mtdna lineages is composed of subclades of the predominant west eurasian hg r <dig>  <cit> . r <dig>  formerly known as pre-hv  <cit> , is defined by substitutions at nucleotide positions   <dig> and  <dig> relative to r  <cit> . its frequency as a whole declines towards the east and south, but in the near east, the caucasus and central asia its frequency is still as high as 10–30%  <cit> . until now, more than  <dig> sub-lineages of hg h, the predominant subclade of r <dig>  which accounts for roughly 40% of west eurasian mtdnas, have been described  <cit>  and the variance of their regional distributions has been discussed  <cit> .

previous studies have proposed that hg h originated in the middle east ~ <dig> –  <dig> kya, expanded into europe in association with a second paleolithic wave  and was strongly involved in late-glacial expansions from ice-age refugia after the lgm   <cit> . for a few sub-hg of hg h, coalescence ages were determined using either entire mtdna genomes  <cit>  or parts of the mtdna control region  <cit> . hg h <dig>  h <dig> and v share an estimated common origin in the terminal pleistocene , with major expansion in the early holocene   <cit> . recent estimates on expansion times of selected h sub-hgs  <cit>  are in conflict with the appraisals derived by  <cit> , thus leaving the question on the reliability on the applied methods unanswered.

the objective of this study was to provide new information concerning the phylogenetic characteristics of macro-hg r <dig>  as well as to determine spatial distribution patterns and coalescence ages of all its major sub-hgs.

RESULTS
in a total of  <dig>  samples from five european populations residing in central and south-east europe  and one middle east population , we found  <dig>  samples  to belong to hg r <dig> based on either control region or coding region analysis. of these,  <dig>  samples contained enough dna to obtain a dataset of full haplotypes consisting of entire control region sequences and  <dig> snps from the coding region. these haplotypes are listed in the additional file  <dig> 

haplogroup frequencies
the frequency of r <dig> in the different populations varied significantly  when taking all populations into account. within europe however, no significant differences were observed between populations . the location of the chosen populations and the respective proportion of r <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  the five european populations from austria, germany, hungary, macedonia and romania showed significant differences in the abundance of hgs h*, h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  hv <dig>  hv <dig>  r0a and v . the prevalence of the remaining sub-hgs h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> was consistent across europe . analyses of molecular variance  revealed significant statistical differences between most of the populations, except for the german population sample, which reflected well the typical european haplotype composition. a highly probable cause for the pronounced heterogeneity of the genetic substructure of r <dig> between the different populations  is genetic drift, which is particularly strong for less frequent haplogroups as most of r <dig> sub-haplogroups. hg h was under-represented in the two hungarian speaking populations csángó and székely from romania, which could be explained by the described effects of genetic isolation especially in the csángó population  <cit> . h <dig> and h <dig> exceeded the expected values in austrians, while these hgs were not observed in the romanians at all. h <dig>  h <dig> and v occurred at unexpectedly high frequencies in the hungarians from romania and macedonians. h <dig> was only found in the macedonian population sample. apart from dubai, r0a was only observed in romanian hungarians. this observation reflects well the spatial frequency distribution of r0a, with the center of gravity in the arabian peninsula and only faint concurrencies in the south-eastern part of europe  <cit> .

phylogenetic topology of haplogroup r0
r <dig> delineates from r* by the absence of nucleotide substitutions relative to the rcrs at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and it can further be divided into two major clades: hv* is defined by the absence of transition c14766t, while r0a is defined by a set of variants at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . figure  <dig> gives an overview of the phylogenetic backbone of r <dig> as described before and updated by  <cit>  including new information from the present study.

the r0a sub-lineage is defined by the motif c64t t2442c t3847c c13188t t16126c t16362c  <cit> . this hg shows a particular instability in the neighborhood of position  <dig>  all of our r0a samples showed c64t , half of them showed a t-insertion at position  <dig> . this constitutes a sub-clade of r0a, r0a2; in  <cit>  this sub-clade is named as 1b). all but one of the  <dig> r0a samples carried an additional transition t58c; which could correspond with 1a <dig> in  <cit> ; this seems to constitute part of the motif defining a sub-branch of hg 1a ; here we rename 1a and 1a <dig> as r0a <dig> and r0a1a for consistency. transition t58c appears also within r0a <dig>  <cit> . conclusively, we found four different haplotypes between nps  <dig> and  <dig> within r0a: t58c- <dig> t-c64t ,  <dig> t-c64t , t58c-64t  and c64t alone . in  <cit>  we find additional variation at this segment, for instance, their complete genome ar <dig>  carries a transversion t59a, while their sample ar <dig>  carries transversion t58a.

transition 16209c was found in eleven out of twelve h1a1-samples; therefore, this variant could be perfectly part of the motif of an h1a <dig> sub-branch. position  <dig> has been traditionally used as a diagnostic position of hg r together with only one coding region transition, g11719a; this variant appears also quite often within hg h  <cit> . in addition, this variant appears for instance in complete mtdna genomes within h1a , h <dig>  <cit> , h4a , etc. therefore, defining hg r by only a73g is imprecise. in our dataset, we observed for example the occurrence of a73g within h4a <dig>  within h <dig>  a new sub-lineage, here identified as h7- <dig> seems to be characterized at least by the following array of variants g709a, t16172c and c16173t. this lineage seems to be geographically restricted to eastern europe since it appears only in the székely  <cit> ; note that the control region motif t16172c c16173t appears also in the kurdish  and the one from family tree dna retrieved from genbank with accession number eu <dig>  transition t195c is probably part of the basal motif of h <dig>  as identified in three complete genomes  <cit> . our data also support the unnamed cluster identified by  <cit>  characterized by the transition g7337a . it can be tentatively said that h <dig> is additionally identified by position g16129a; however, so far there is only one complete genome available supporting this fact .

demographic expansion and coalescence times
in order to estimate the time of the most recent common ancestor  of the different r0-subclades, two different approaches were applied: on the one hand, the shape of the distribution of the number of observed differences between pairs of entire control region sequences  was used for timing expansions  <cit> . the mismatch distribution is usually multimodal in samples drawn from populations at demographic equilibrium, as it reflects the highly stochastic shape of gene trees, but it is usually unimodal in populations having passed through a recent demographic expansion  <cit>  or through a range expansion with high levels of migration between neighbouring demes  <cit> . on the other hand, model-free rho statistics  <cit>  were calculated on the basis of hvs-i  and entire control region sequences and used for estimating the coalescence time of the different subclades. finally, the results were compared to each other and to so far published estimates .

concordant estimates  are bold.

a estimate of the time of the most recent common ancestor of each cluster, using the demographic parameter τ inferred from the entire mtdna control region 

b average number of base substitutions in the mtdna entire cr  or hvs-i  from the ancestral sequence type 

c estimate of the tmrca of each cluster, using rho statistics inferred from entire cr or hvs-i sequences

d estimate of the tmrca as published in  <cit>  based on hvs-i sequences

e estimate of the tmrca as published in  <cit>  based on the mtdna coding region  sequences

f n.d.: not determined

g estimate was derived for hg v.

interestingly, although different sequence ranges were used and different mathematical and conceptually different methods were applied, the estimates of the majority of subclades corresponded well with each other. in general, it can be said that most hg h sub-lineages show a strong signal for the beginning of the population expansion after the lgm, covering the late pleistocene and early holocene.

the coalescence age for the entire hg h was estimated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  thousand years ago  using the parameter τ from the mmd of the entire cr, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya using rho statistics based on hvs-i. both estimates are in good concordance with each other and with the estimate from  <cit>  . the expected and the observed mmd for hg h were found to be in good agreement , with an ssd p value of  <dig> . ssd p values >  <dig>  hint to the adequacy of the sudden expansion model, thus making the observed mismatch distributions compatible with the estimated parameters  <cit> . despite an apparent lack of goodness-of-fit of some distributions , the adequacy of the sudden expansion model could only be rejected for hg h <dig> . interestingly, the rho estimate derived from entire cr sequences was low .

the near eastern hg r0a, which is geographically centred in the midst of the arabian peninsula  <cit> , was estimated to have expanded between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya ; the estimate derived from hvs-i lay in between .

the oldest sublineage of hg h was found to be h <dig>  with highly concordant estimates for the tmrca of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya . as in hg h, the estimate derived from cr rho statistics was lowest .

consistent estimates for the tmrca using both computational methods were obtained for most of the hgs  . however, apart from h <dig> and h13a <dig>  where our three estimates  were highly consistent with each other, matching estimates were derived by comparing the mmd estimate with rho statistics from either cr or hvs-i sequences. in hgs h <dig> and hv <dig> the different approached used yielded very different mean values but associated with very large and overlapping confidence intervals.

published estimates for the coalescence time of hg h <dig> lay at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  <cit>  or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  <cit> . our estimates were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya . thus, both our values  derived from entire control region sequences fit very well with the estimate from coding region sequences, while our rho estimate from hvs-i sequences fits well with the roostalu's et al. hvs-i appraisal. it seems that hvs-i sequences in hg h <dig> do not correspond to the molecular clock calibration from the eurasian tree, in a sense that mutations in hvs-i occur at a higher rate in h <dig> compared to phylogenetically closely related lineages.

most recently, molecular dating has been questioned fundamentally, and the calibration of the molecular clock of the mtdna control region as basic requirement for timing the most recent common ancestor has led to an ongoing discussion . however, occasional concerns that the molecular clock might be elusive and not tick regularly for human mtdna were widely eliminated  <cit> . a coding-region rate estimate of  <dig> years per substitution  <cit>  corresponds well with estimates for the hvs-i rate  <cit>  and with a rate of one control-region mutation per  <dig> years for the eurasian tree  <cit>  and can be used to estimate the coalescence time of various haplogroups of the mtdna phylogeny. a straight forward way to estimate the age of a particular "root" haplotype, given the mutation rate, is to consider all available descendant individual sequences and take the arithmetic mean over all distances to the root haplotype. this method is referred to as "rho" estimation  <cit>  and can be performed using the freely available software package network.

one of the disadvantages of the simple rho method is the conversion of dna-data into files that can be handled with the network program. without some in-house executables that assist the conversion, this would be an elaborate and error-prone process. on the other hand, network offers the calculation of the standard error of rho, which would be very complicated if calculated by hand.

the estimation of the demographic parameter τ from the mismatch distributions between pairs of sequences can be performed with arlequin, which seems to be more user-friendly regarding data import. one of the disadvantages of this method is that it does not account for the rate heterogeneity of the different mutations, and that it needs calibration against an archaeological or historical record.

the observed differences between the two approaches might thus rely on the slightly imprecise estimate of the mtdna control region's molecular clock affecting the rho estimate and on the disregard of variation in site-specific mutation rates affecting the mmd estimation.

it seems that the rho statistics derived from entire cr-sequences tends to underestimate the tmrca, while the rho statistics derived from hvs-i sequences tends to predate the tmrca. this is most likely due to the calibration of the molecular clock of the different dna stretches of the mitochondrial genome, which need further fine-tuning. under this perspective, it seems advisable to follow both approaches for timing the coalescence age of phylogenetic clusters, and to put the estimates into a geological-historical context. in general, more complete genome information is desirable in order to get more accurate estimates.

genetic variability within r0-subhaplogroups
hg h <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of the samples and showed a high diversity in terms of different lineages . reticulations within h <dig> were mainly caused by mutational hotspots in the control region that emerged in its different sub-hgs, such as variation at  <dig>   <dig>  etc.

hg h2a represented  <dig> % of the samples and displayed less genetic variation . the control region marker  <dig> identifies hg h1d  <cit>  and h <dig>  but also popped up on an h2a <dig> background and led to one reticulation in the h2a network. this transition is however slightly unstable since it appears frequently in other non-h hg backgrounds, such as hg k  <cit> .

hg h <dig> was assigned to  <dig> % of samples and was characterized by several clusters of identical profiles, thus implying little genetic differentiation . the network of additional file  <dig> shows just two reticulations provoked by two fast control region variants, t152c and t16311c.

hg h <dig> corresponded to  <dig> % of the samples, and showed very little genetic variation . as in hg h <dig>  mutations at position  <dig> were responsible for network reticulations.

hg h <dig> was realized in  <dig> % of samples and revealed an enormous amount of lineage diversity , especially when compared to the putatively same-aged hg h <dig>  again, some fast positions are responsible for a number of reticulations,  <dig>   <dig>  etc.

hg h <dig> appeared in  <dig> % of the samples and in relation to its relatively recent arrival in europe , it exhibited pronounced genetic diversification .

hg h <dig> rendered for  <dig> % of samples and demonstrated perfect tree-like evolution of lineages .

hgs h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> could be differentiated in less than  <dig> % of samples each. due to small sample sizes, corresponding networks could only be constructed for h <dig>  and h <dig> .

hg h <dig> was determined in  <dig> % of the sequences but manifested hardly any genetic heterogeneity .

hg h <dig> encompassed  <dig> % of the profiles and was estimated to have arisen  <dig>  kya  <cit> . with respect to its frequency, its genetic distinction  and our tmrca estimations, the age estimate of  <cit>  seems overstated.

hg h13a <dig> comprised  <dig> % of samples and similar to hg h <dig>  the profiles grouped in big clusters mirroring a perfect tree-like pattern of evolution .

hg h <dig> and h <dig> covered  <dig> % of sequences each, but the network of h <dig>  indicated higher genetic diverseness than the network of h <dig> .

hg h <dig> embraced  <dig> % of samples and was characterized by an array of uncommon mutations that led to a reticulation-free structure of the network .

hg h*  was found in  <dig> % of samples and showed an amazingly high grade of diversification .

hg r0a spanned only  <dig> % of samples, but the corresponding network suggest an old age of the hg, with a complete tree-like structure .

hgs v, hv* , hv <dig>  hv <dig> and hv0a together comprehended  <dig> % of the study individuals and map onto a straightforward phylogenetic network, with reticulations mainly caused by mutations on position  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of  <dig>  mtdna haplotypes belonging to r <dig>  the most common hg-cluster in west eurasia, revealed significant differences in the distribution of different sub-hgs even between geographically closely located regions. given an estimated coalescence time of the distinct lineages of  <dig> –  <dig> kya, the differences in the distributions could hint to either limited maternal gene flow after the lgm due to the alpine nature of the regions involved, or to a stochastic loss of diversity due to environmental events and/or disease episodes occurred at different times and in distinctive regions , or most likely, to genetic drift, particularly strong for less frequent haplogroups as most of r <dig> sub-haplogroups characterized here.

our comparison of two different ways of obtaining the timing of the tmrca confirms that the time of a sudden expansion  can be adequately recovered from control region data with valid confidence intervals. the observed differences between the two approaches might rely on the slightly imprecise estimate of the mtdna control region's molecular clock affecting the rho estimate and on the disregard of variation in site-specific mutation rates affecting the mmd estimation. so for reliable estimates, both procedures should be applied in order to cross-check the results for validity and soundness.
