BACKGROUND
nowadays, frequent occurrences of abnormal weather events have been observed all over the world, such as drought and extreme temperature. these stresses seriously impact plant growth and crops production  <cit> . recently, several progresses have been made about the identification of stress-related genes, which potentially are able to increase the plant tolerance . understanding the molecular mechanism of the abiotic stresses response is important to improve tolerance using molecular techniques.

generally, these stress signals are converted into cellular responses through two ways, including aba-dependent and aba-independent signaling pathways  <cit> . for the former, aba is accumulated under osmotic stress caused by drought. it regulates the expression of gene under osmotic stress conditions  <cit> . the aba-responsive element  is the major cis-element for aba-responsive gene expression. abre-binding protein  and abre-binding factor  control gene expression in aba-dependent manner . the molecular studies have revealed that aba-independent pathway is also important for stress tolerance in plants. dehydration-responsive element binding protein 1/c-repeat binding factor  and dreb <dig> are mainly involved in cold and heat stresses, respectively . the dreb/cbf transcription factors  could specific bind to dre/crt cis-elements in promoter of target genes  <cit> . several proteins, such as ice <dig>  zat <dig>  camta <dig>  and myb <dig>  have been identified as regulators of dreb1/cbf genes  <cit> . in addition, nac and myb/myc also regulate abiotic stress-responsive genes expression  <cit> . the studies have demonstrated that there are interactions between aba signaling pathway and other signaling factors in stress responses  <cit> .

until now, a large number of transcriptome sequencing projects have been conducted in many species. genome-wide analyses have dramatically improved the efficiency of gene identification  <cit> . in arabidopsis, about 30 % of the transcripts were related with abiotic stresses, and  <dig>  genes played important roles in cold, salt, and drought stresses  <cit> . in chrysanthemum,  <dig>  dehydration-responsive transcripts were detected using rna-seq  <cit> . in wheat, about 2 % of the wheat genes were related with the cold stress  <cit> . in populus and switchgrass, heat responsive genes were also identified by transcriptome sequencing  <cit> . in a. mongolicus,  <dig>  up-regulated and  <dig>  down-regulated genes were identified under cold stress  <cit> .

brassica rapa contains several subspecies, such as chinese cabbage , nhcc, and turnip   <cit> . the genome of chinese cabbage had been sequenced, however, there is little information about the nhcc genome and gene dataset. therefore, we conducted de novo assembly and gene annotation without prior genome information in this study. nhcc is one of the most important vegetables in china, and now is cultivated extensively worldwide. it is inevitable injured by low or heat stresses, which can directly lead to the production decrease and affect edible quality. the heat stress can affect the photosynthesis, and even induce the occurrence of several diseases, such as downy mildew, soft rot and virus diseases. the physiological change of temperature response mediated by several genes has been reported in model plants  <cit> . however, little is known about the temperature-regulated genes and the related pathways in nhcc.

in this study, we conducted the comprehensive characterization for nhcc using rna-seq, and explored the effect of low and heat temperature on global change. we identified several most important genes in temperature response, and discussed their regulatory networks and crosstalk in cold and heat stresses. using illumina sequencing technology, we generated over  <dig> billion base of high quality sequence, and identified a larger number of differentially and specifically expressed transcripts. furthermore, we also identified lots of lncrnas, and constructed the coexpression network of lncrnas and protein encoding genes using this transcriptome dataset.

RESULTS
rna sequencing and de novo assembly of nhcc transcriptome
to obtain a global overview of nhcc transcriptome under different temperature treatments, we constructed and sequenced  <dig> rna-seq libraries, including cold treatments , heat treatment , and normal condition . for each temperature, three samples as the biological replications were sequenced using illumina hiseq™  <dig>  the base quality of reads was checked using fastqc . we used relatively stringent criteria for quality control by removing the reads with adaptors and the low quality. finally,  <dig> , <dig> clean pair-end  reads consisting of  <dig>  billion nucleotides  were obtained with an average gc content of  <dig>  % . after the first assembly,  <dig> , <dig> contigs were obtained for all libraries, and the total length over  <dig>  mb . the contigs were further joined into <dig>  unigenes using paired-end information and gap filling process. the total length of all unigenes was  <dig>  mb, and the mean length of unigene was 1124 bp . the pe sequencing not only increases the depth, but also improves de novo assembly efficiency. the n <dig> achieved 1705 bp, which was larger than most plants de novo assembled by rna-seq, such as radish , wax gourd , and celery  . this phenomenon indicated that the high quality and accuracy of our assembled transcripts. based on frkm, we measured the correlation of three repeats for each temperature. the results showed that there was a good correlation among three repeats. the pearson’s correlations of almost all comparisons were larger than 85 % .table  <dig> the summary of the sequencing and assembly

functional annotation and classification of the assembled unigenes
among all  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   unigenes significantly matched a sequence in at least one of the public databases, including ncbi non-redundant protein , gene ontology , clusters of orthologous group , swiss-prot and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  . the size distribution of blast-aligned coding sequence  and predicted proteins are analyzed . the remaining unigenes that did not match these databases were analyzed by three programs to predict coding regions. finally,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> coding sequences were predicted by estscan, cpc, and cnci programs, respectively . the venn diagram showed that there were  <dig> coding sequences predicted by these three programs, so these genes were relatively reliable as coding genes . a total of  <dig>  coding transcripts were predicted in our study. then we aligned these unigenes with the proteins of chinese cabbage . the results showed that  <dig>  unigenes could align to the  <dig>  chinese cabbage proteins . in addition, we found that over 70 % nhcc transcripts could match with more than  <dig> chinese cabbage genes . this phenomenon might be caused by the genome duplication of b. rapa. the sequences without a homologous hit might represent novel genes in the genome, and some of them might be the specifically expressed in nhcc for temperature treatments. in addition, they also might be the non-coding, alternative transcription, lineage-specific or high allelic variant unigenes.fig.  <dig> the alignment analysis for nhcc rna-seq transcripts and chinese cabbage  proteins. a the summary of the aligned and un-aligned transcripts. b the distribution of the aligned transcripts of the nhcc



for nr annotations,  <dig>  unigenes matched in this database . the result indicated that  <dig>  % of the top hits showed strong homology with the e-value < 1e- <dig> . the distribution pattern showed that  <dig>  % of unigenes had a similarity higher than 60 % . the majority annotated unigenes were corresponded to the known plant genes, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % matching with a. thaliana and a. lyrata, respectively . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were assigned at least one go term, and all go terms were classified into three groups and further divided into  <dig> functional subgroups . overall, only  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to cog classification . among  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for ‘general functions prediction only’  represented the largest group, followed by ‘transcription’, and ‘replication, recombination and repair’ . to identify the biological pathways activated in nhcc, the assembled unigenes were annotated with kegg. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were significantly matched in this database, and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the result showed that three largest pathway groups were metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , and plant-pathogen interactions . following these three groups, the plant hormone signal transduction  was about  <dig>  % of all annotated genes. the level  <dig> of this pathway was ‘environmental information processing’, and the level  <dig> of it was ‘signal transduction’ in the kegg database.

temperature-dependent gene expression patterns identified by rna-seq in nhcc
to view the gene expression, all genes were divided into three categories, including highly , medium , and lowly  expressed in each library. the results showed that most genes belonged to lowly expressed, followed by medium, and highly expressed . the purple line shows the cumulative expressed gene number as the library number increased, and  <dig>  genes were detected by all libraries.

to evaluate the temperature decrease course and temperature-dependent transcriptomic activities during cold-resistance process in nhcc, we performed a temperature decrease course differential gene expression analysis by comparing any two adjacent cold treatments, using the higher temperature treatment as the denominator. there were  <dig>  possible patterns, including those that increased across all treatment boundaries, termed‘up-up-up’ ; those that were similar across all boundaries, termed ‘maintain-maintain-maintain’ ; and those that decreased across all boundaries, termed ‘decrease-decrease-decrease’ . the results showed that genes were non-randomly represented across all patterns, and the overall temperature-dependent patterns are analyzed . only few genes continuously decreased  or increased  in expression accompanying temperature decrease, and the number were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. however, majority genes  belonged to the mmm pattern, and the expression almost unchanged over the temperature decrease process. in addition to mmm, the mmu  and dmm  were also contained more genes than other expression patterns.fig.  <dig> cold stress dependent patterns of nhcc gene expression. dges were determined based on a combination of q-value > <dig>  and fc > = <dig> , the two sequential temperatures were compared, with the higher temperature used as the denominator. genes were grouped into u , d , or m . shown here are the  <dig> possible expression patterns. the x axis represents the four point during temperature decrease and the y axis represents the log <dig> fpkm. the number shown in each box was derived based on the number of genes for each expression pattern



differential expressed genes detection and compare them among each treatment
to identify the temperature respond genes,  <dig>  degs were detected between each temperature-treated and control library  . all degs were used for clustering analysis, and obtained a well cluster results . three repeats for each temperature got together, and  <dig>   <dig> and 25 °c formed one group, while - <dig> and 44 °c formed another group. on the whole, all degs were divided into three groups, and defined as i, ii, and iii. most degs in group i belonged to up-regulated genes under -4 °c treatment, while similar in other four temperatures. in group ii, the expression of most degs under  <dig> and -4 °c was lower than that under other three temperatures. in group iii, most degs had relatively low expression, except a few genes under 44 °c.fig.  <dig> scatter plot indicating the comparative results of log transformed gene expression levels  and degs  distributions between control  and treatment  samples. the red dot represents up-regulated gene; the green dot represents down-regulated gene. t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  tm <dig>  and t <dig> represent  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  - <dig>  and 44 °c, respectively. a t <dig> vs t4;  t <dig> vs t0;  t <dig> vs tm4;  t <dig> vs t44

to further survey the interaction of these treatments for degs, we constructed venn diagram using degs of each treatment. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs under  <dig>   <dig>  - <dig>  and 44 °c, respectively. among of them,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> belonged to each treatment-specific degs . interestingly, we found  <dig> degs were detected in all treatments, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . the functional annotation showed that most of them belonged to the stresses related protein, such as lea <dig> and kin <dig> . in addition, we also conducted qrt-pcr experiment to verify the accuracy of the rna-seq. the results showed that the expression trends of all genes were consistent with the rna-seq, and most genes were also significant differently expressed  . among all degs,  <dig> were up-regulated, and  <dig>  were down-regulated under 4 °c;  <dig>  were up-regulated,  <dig>  were down-regulated under 0 °c;  <dig>  were up-regulated,  <dig>  were down-regulated under -4 °c. however, there were fewer degs under 44 °c than cold treatment, with only  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated genes . among these degs, the most treatment-specific up-regulated genes  were detected under -4 °c, and the most treatment-specific down-regulated genes  were detected under 0 °c .table  <dig> the expression and functional annotation of  <dig> degs identified by all the cold and heat treatments. the up/down-regulated genes were identified by comparing the treatment  and control 



the enrichment analyses revealed most degs related with cold and heat stresses
to understand the function of degs, we have conducted the go enrichment analyses using all unigenes as background . under 4 °c, several cold related go categories were significantly enriched, such as response to desiccation, response to cold, response to temperature stimulus, and cold acclimation. the photosynthesis, light harvesting, and translation categories were the top enrichment under 0 °c. of course, the cold related categories were also enriched at the top  <dig> categories. under -4 °c, the mainly enrichment categories were secondary metabolite biosynthetic process, s-glycoside metabolic process, glycosinolate, and glucosinolate metabolic process. however, we did not detect directly cold related categories as  <dig> and 0 °c at the top  <dig> categories. this phenomenon indicated the regulatory mechanism might exit several differences between chilling  and freezing  temperatures, which was also consistent with the previous report  <cit> . under 44 °c, the mainly enrichment categories were response to high light intensity, heat acclimation, photosynthesis, and response to heat. in addition, the photosynthesis was also enriched under heat stress, which indicated that all temperature stresses could affect plant photosynthesis. we also analyzed genes belonged to the go enrichment categories. among all treatments, the most specific genes  were found under -4 °c, followed by 0 °c , 4 °c , and 44 °c . in addition,  <dig> genes were identified under all three cold treatments, and  <dig> genes were detected by all the cold and heat treatments .

in addition, we mapped degs to terms in kegg database to identify significantly enriched pathways. among the mapped pathways,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> pathways were significantly enriched  under  <dig>   <dig>  - <dig>  and 44 °c treatments, respectively . notably, common enrichments were observed in photosynthesis pathway, metabolic pathway, and photosynthesis-antenna proteins pathway in all treatments. this results indicated that the cold and heat stresses affected the expression of genes involved in these pathways. most enriched pathways were also detected by the previous reports, which partly reflected the accuracy of our results  <cit> . interestingly, we found transcripts involved in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway were significantly enriched under 44 °c treatment, while it did not enrich in cold treatment. this phenomenon indicated that this pathway might only play roles in heat resistance. we also analyzed the genes belonged to the kegg enrichment categories. among all treatments, the most specific genes  were found under -4 °c, followed by 0 °c , 4 °c , and 44 °c . forty-five genes were identified under all three cold treatments, and  <dig> genes were detected by all the cold and heat treatments . furthermore, we also surveyed the enrichment genes identified by combing the go and kegg databases. the results showed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were enriched in the two databases under cold and heat treatments, respectively . these enriched genes will greatly enhance the potential utilization in cold and heat stresses of nhcc.

identification of abiotic stresses related transcription factors from degs
given that tfs have a major effect on the network of temperature-responsive genes, we also identified the temperature-inducible tfs. overall, the number of dehydrin, chloroa_b-bind, p <dig>  ap <dig>  psi_psah, and ef-hand was more than other tfs in three cold treatments . however, many gst were identified under -4 °c, while they were absent under  <dig> and 4 °c. this phenomenon indicated that gst might play roles in the cold resistance below 0 °c. interestingly, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> were identified under  <dig> and 4 °c, indicating that there was a certain inherent association between cold and heat regulation. under 44 °c, hsp <dig> was significant enriched, which revealed that it played important roles in heat-resistance regulation . in all treatments, p <dig> and chloroa_b-bind tfs were enriched, which indicated that cold and heat stresses had great impact on plant photosynthesis, and thus might affect crop yields. this revealed that they were related with plant photosynthesis, which was also consistent with previous reports  <cit> .

among all treatments, the most specific tfs were identified under -4 °c , followed by 0 °c , and 4 °c  in go enrichment . in addition,  <dig> tfs were identified under all three cold treatments, and  <dig> genes were detected by all cold and heat treatments. among all kegg categories, the most specific tfs  were found under -4 °c, followed by 0 °c , and 4 °c  . twenty-nine genes were identified under all three cold treatments, and  <dig> genes were detected by all cold and heat treatments. combing go and kegg enrichment analyses,  <dig> and  <dig> tfs were enriched only under cold and heat treatments, respectively .table  <dig> the intersection of differntially expressed transcription factors under cold stress in go and kegg enrichment categories



ap2/erf tfs mainly contained two subgroups, including cbf and dreb <dig>  they interacted with dre/crt cis-element and regulated aba-independent gene expression. the cbf controlled many gene expression under several stresses, such as drought, salinity and freezing stresses. the dreb <dig> mainly affected gene expression under osmotic and heat stresses, while it slightly played role in cold stress  <cit> . although the functions of these tfs were well explained, the interaction among them was rarely reported, especially in b. rapa. therefore, we conducted correlation analysis for these tfs, and constructed the interaction network of them using expression values. a total of  <dig> unigenes were detected using blast alignment with abfs, cbfs, and dreb <dig> of arabidopsis . the pearson correlations coefficient  between two of these tfs were calculated using the expression value. then the interaction network was constructed using part connections with the pcc larger than 80 %. finally, this network contained  <dig> connections, including  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative connections . this phenomenon revealed that most connections belonged to positive relationship among of these tfs. however, we noted that cl <dig> contig <dig>  a abf tf, had negative connections with two dreb2a , cbf <dig> , and cbf <dig> .fig.  <dig> the interaction network for dreb <dig>  cbf, and abf tfs, which was constructed based on pccs. the expression value of tfs at each treatment was used for calculating the pccs. the blue lines represent the positive correlation, while the red lines represent the negative correlation



to analyze the correlation of abiotic stresses and these tfs, we collected mainly cold and heat stresses related genes according to previous reports  <cit> . then the candidate heat and cold related genes in nhcc were identified using blast alignment with the collected genes. we calculated pcc of these candidate genes and cbf or dreb <dig>  the pcc values larger than  <dig>  were selected to construct interaction network . this network showed that there were more negative connections in dreb <dig> than that in cbf, which only contained four negative connections. among all connections, we identified  <dig> transcripts, which had high pcc  with dreb <dig>  such as hsf, lea, and myb <dig>  by cbfs,  <dig> transcripts were also identified, such as cor <dig> , wd <dig>  and abf <dig>  moreover,  <dig> transcripts were detected by both dreb <dig> and cbf, including grp <dig>  p <dig>  pp2c, and srk2e .fig.  <dig> model for dreb <dig> and cbf signal regulation in response to heat and cold stresses. the overlapping or specific abiotic stresses related genes were detected, which had high pcc  with dreb <dig> or cbfs



identification and characterisation of nhcc lncrna using rna-seq
to identify potential lncrna in nhcc, all sequences from nhcc transcriptome dataset were used. based on previous reports , we designed the pipeline for lncrna analyses. finally,  <dig>  lncrnas were identified after a series filtering, including transcript length, coding potential, orf size, and the exclusion of other ncrna. among these lncrnas,  <dig>  belonged to the novel lncrnas. in addition, we also identified  <dig> pri-mirna through comparing with rfam and mirbase databases for comparative analyses.

lncrna gene expression analyses and differently expressed lncrnas identification
lncrna is a group of endogenous rnas that function as regulators of gene expression, which are involved in developmental and physiological processes  <cit> . they are longer than 200 bp, and several of them can also act as primary transcripts for the production of short rnas  <cit> . we assessed the expression pattern under different temperatures using the expressed lncrna . a total of  <dig>  lncrnas were expressed in all the treatments. we observed that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> lncrnas belonged to the temperature specificity for t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  tm <dig>  and t <dig>  respectively . however, a hierarchical clustering of samples showed most lncrna was low expression in each temperature . in this study,  <dig> pri-mirna,  <dig>  lncrnas, and  <dig>  protein coding transcripts were identified. the average, maximum, and median expression values of these three type transcripts were calculated for comparative analyses. the results showed that the expression of protein coding transcripts were more than that of pri-mirna and lncrna . most pri-mirna and lncrna had relatively low expression, which was consistent with the previous reports , indicating it was a common property of lncrna. we also investigated the temperature specific expressed transcripts  among these three types transcripts. the results showed that  <dig>  % pri-mirna,  <dig>  % lncrna, and  <dig>  % protein coding transcripts were detected as sets. for pri-mirna,  <dig> sets were detected in 44 °c, while no set was found in  <dig> and 25 °c . for lncrna, the most sets were identified in -4 °c , followed by 44 °c , and 0 °c  . the similar trends were also found in the protein-coding transcripts, except the inverse of  <dig> and 25 °c .fig.  <dig> the comparative analyses of lncrna, pri-mirna, and protein-coding genes expression pattern. a, b, c the average, maximum, and median expression analysis of lncrna, pri-mirna, and protein coding transcripts in nhcc using boxplot. d, e, f the temperature specific expressed transcripts of lncrna, pri-mirna, and protein coding transcripts in nhcc



to further investigate the share or specific of these treatments for differently expressed lncrnas , we conducted the venn diagram analyses. the results showed that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> specifically expressed lncrnas were identified under  <dig>   <dig>  - <dig>  and 44 °c, respectively . however, we not detected the share lncrnas among all these treatments. among of these dels, most of them were down-regulated, and there were the most down-regulated lncrnas under 0 °c  than other three treatments  . interestingly, the del number under three cold stresses  was more than that of 44 °c, which only contained  <dig> dels. however, most lncrnas  were up-regulated under 44 °c, while most lncrnas belonged to the down-regulated under other three cold treatments .

construct the coexpression network between lncrnas and protein-coding genes
we constructed a coexpression network for lncrnas and protein-coding genes according to the previously proposed method  <cit> . for each treatments and for each pair of genes , we computed the pccs of expression patterns using the expression values. we found that approximately  <dig>  % were positive connections, and  <dig>  % were negative connections . among all connections, the pccs of  <dig>  % were between - <dig>  to - <dig> , and followed by  <dig>  % connections were between  <dig>  to  <dig>  furthermore, we identified  <dig> , <dig> connections between protein-coding and protein-coding genes, among which,  <dig>  % were positive connections, and  <dig>  % were negative connections . however, the opposite result was found between lncrna and lncrna connections, and the values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  % for positive and negative connections, respectively.

to be more accurate and intuitive showed the relationship between the lncrnas and protein-coding genes, we selected the connections with the high correlation  to construct the interaction network. overall, the whole network constituted by these connections was divided into  <dig> clusters, including  <dig> large networks and  <dig> relative small networks . in the cluster  <dig>  about 67 % connections with the pcc >  <dig> , and ~33 % with the pcc =  <dig>  the pccs of all connections in the cluster  <dig> were larger than  <dig> , but less than  <dig>  only three connections with pcc less than - <dig>  were located in the cluster <dig> and cluster <dig>  most connections  in the networks belonged to positive, and only  <dig> connections were negative correlation . this phenomenon was also found in lncrna vs lncrna and protein-coding vs protein-coding genes. among all of these three types,  <dig>  % connections were positive, and  <dig>  % were negative connections.

to further analyze the correlation between lncrna and protein-coding genes under temperature stresses, we annotated the function of the target genes. a total of  <dig> target genes were regulated by lncrnas under all three cold treatments, and comparing them with arabidopsis . the annotation showed that most of them belonged to the cold respond proteins, such as cbf <dig>  cor <dig> , and lea <dig>  similar, we identified  <dig> target genes of lncrnas under 44 °c treatment, and most of them belonged to the heat respond genes, such as hsp, ltp, and cbf <dig> . furthermore, we also found several target genes of lncrnas under cold and heat stresses, such as kin <dig>  this phenomenon indicated that they might play important roles in the corsstalk between cold and heat stresses responses.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, approximately  <dig> million paired-end reads representing  <dig>  unigenes with a total length of  <dig>  mb were obtained. only few genes were ddd or uuu expression patterns, and majority genes belonged to mmm pattern during the temperature decrease process.  <dig>  degs were detected between at least one treatment and control library. among which,  <dig> degs were identified in all treatments, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes. the enrichment analyses demonstrated that most temperature related categories were discovered under cold and heat treatments. among the enrichment categories,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified in both co and kegg databases under cold and heat treatments, respectively.

totally,  <dig>  lncrnas were identified from nhcc transcriptome dataset, and  <dig>  belonged to novel lncrnas. the analyses indicated the expression of protein coding transcripts were higher than that of pri-mirna and lncrna. we constructed a coexpression network for lncrnas and protein-coding genes. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> target genes were regulated by lncrnas under three cold and heat treatments, respectively. furthermore, we also identified several shared target genes of lncrnas under cold and heat treatments, which indicated that they might play important roles in the corsstalk between cold and heat stresses.

in conclusion, we conduct comprehensive analyses for cold and heat stresses in nhcc using rna-seq, and identified numerous differentially and specifically expressed transcripts. many important genes and tfs response to treatment stress were detected, and their crosstalk between cold and heat stress responses was discovered. in addition, we also identified large number of lncrnas, and constructed the coexpression network of lncrnas and protein encoding genes. this study provides a platform for elucidating physiologic responses to low and high temperature in b. rapa.
