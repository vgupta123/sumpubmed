BACKGROUND
pathogenic strains of salmonella continue to pose an unacceptable worldwide threat to the health of humans and livestock. infection of humans with s. typhimurium results in a debilitating case of severe gastroenteritis that may result in death in immunocompromised individuals. there are about  <dig>  billion cases of non-typhoidal salmonellosis worldwide each year and it is estimated that there are  <dig> million cases and over  <dig>  deaths each year caused by typhoid fever  <cit> . in the current study we focus on s. typhimurium, which once ingested via contaminated food or water, invades human gut epithelial cells resulting in bloody diarrhoea. s. typhimurium is able to invade intestinal epithelial cells due to the expression of a horizontally acquired set of virulence genes , which encode a type  <dig> secretion system   <cit> . in the case of murine infection, s. typhimurium can become systemic and cause a typhoid-like fever due to its ability to replicate and survive within macrophages; this is achieved by the expression of a second t3ss encoded by genes within spi <dig>  <cit> . the complex expression patterns of spi <dig> and spi <dig> during infection led us and others to develop the concept of the salmonella extracellular  and intracellular  virulence gene expression programmes,  <cit>  successful host invasion and colonisation requires expression of the stex virulence gene programme followed by expression of the stin programme   <cit> .

the environmentally-dependent expression of nearly all of the stex and stin genes in s. typhimurium is mediated by the bacterial alarmone, guanosine tetraphosphate   <cit> . in salmonella and all beta- and gammaproteobacteria, ppgpp is produced by the activity of two enzymes, rela and spot . whilst rela is only able to synthesise ppgpp, spot contains both synthetase and hydrolase activities. in most other bacteria rela and spot are combined into a single enzyme referred to as rel or rsh   <cit> . previous work implicates spot rather than rela in salmonella pathogenicity since an s. typhimurium Δrela strain is almost fully virulent in balb/c mouse infection studies, whereas a ΔrelaΔspot strain is severely attenuated  <cit> . it has also been shown that ppgpp plays a key role in coupling virulence to metabolic status in several other pathogenic bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> , listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , legionella pneumophilia  <cit> , vibrio cholera  <cit>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . a complete understanding of the pathways and mechanisms by which ppgpp mediates bacterial virulence may suggest targets for antimicrobial therapies  <cit> .

guanosine tetraphosphate appears to exert most of its physiological effects by direct or indirect transcriptional control of target genes and binds near the active centre of rna polymerase  to modulate its activity, resulting in the direct repression of stable rna operons  has revealed an unexpected complexity of bacterial and archaeal transcriptomes  <cit> . a major advance in this area has been the development of differential rna sequencing  which allows global and unambiguous mapping of transcription start sites   <cit> . in this study we utilise drna-seq technology to define the primary transcriptomes of wild-type s. typhimurium and an isogenic ΔrelaΔspot mutant, in order to define the extent of ppgpp-dependent expression. we identified primary tsss for 78% of the annotated s. typhimurium genes as well as ppgpp-dependent and independent alternative tsss. we confirm the expression of known and predicted srnas  <cit> , identify new candidate srnas, and report the discovery of  <dig> candidate antisense transcripts for the entire s. typhimurium genome. our data provides further insights into the regulatory roles of ppgpp, confirming and extending a previously reported link to global regulation of non-coding rnas  <cit> . the high resolution transcriptomic datasets presented here should facilitate future research on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of virulence and other adaptive mechanisms within salmonella.

RESULTS
identification of transcriptional start sites
the nucleotide position of tsss were identified from a drna-seq analysis of rna samples isolated from the s. typhimurium wild type strain  and an isogenic ΔrelaΔspot strain grown to early stationary phase . the drna-seq analysis was performed according to sharma et al  <cit> . for each strain two cdna libraries were prepared from the same total rna sample. one library, referred to as , was enriched for primary transcripts by treating with terminator exonuclease  and the second library, referred to as  or non-enriched, was untreated and contained both primary and processed transcripts. following sequencing of the cdna libraries on roche- <dig> and illumina-solexa platforms the reads were mapped onto the sl <dig> genome  and the number of reads mapping to each nucleotide position were visualised using the integrated genome browser . elevated read numbers at the 5' end of transcripts in the  library relative to the  library were identified as an increased presence of transcripts with 5' ppp end sequences compared to 5' p end sequences as described previously  <cit> . although  <dig> sequencing provided longer read lengths, the read numbers of the solexa dataset were considerably higher and were used primarily for identification of tsss .

we identified a total of  <dig> tss's mapping on to the s. typhimurium sl <dig> chromosome  and a further  <dig> for the slp1- <dig> plasmids. tsss were categorised as primary, secondary, internal or alternative. a definition and summary of the tss categories for the s. typhimurium genome is shown in figure 1ab. as reported for h. pylori, many of the different categories of tsss had multiple associations and this data is summarised in table  <dig>  <cit> . of the total tsss,  <dig> and  <dig> were located upstream of all annotated sl <dig> orfs and stable rnas respectively . primary tsss were identified for a total of  <dig> protein coding genes in  <dig> operons  representing 78% of the annotated sl <dig> genome . it is most likely that the remaining 22% of genes for which no tss's were mapped were either not expressed under the invasion growth conditions modelled in this study or the mrna was subject to in vivo cleavage by rnases . in the latter case the remainder of the transcripts may be ribosome protected resulting in an under-identification of tsss. in order to validate the identification of tsss by drna-seq, several approaches were utilised. analysis of the tsss located directly upstream of annotated orfs revealed that 75% of the transcripts started with a purine residue  in accordance with the known preference for a purine residue at the + <dig> position  <cit> . comparison of the drna-seq identified tsss with  <dig> published s. typhimurium tsss showed that 90% of the drna-seq defined tsss were within ±  <dig> nts of the experimentally defined tsss . lack of concordance between the remaining drnaseq and experimentally determined tsss may reflect growth condition related alternative start sites or that experimental techniques do not always distinguish between processed and unprocessed mrnas. we also used 5' race to verify  <dig> tsss and to clarify  <dig> ambiguous tsss revealing that in each case, the experimentally determined tsss matched those predicted by drna-seq .

compiled from additional file 2: tables s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  p, s, i and alt refer to primary, secondary, internal and ppgpp-dependent tsss respectively. data for slp1- <dig> plasmids not shown.

the direct visualisation of transcribed genomic loci and unambiguous mapping of primary tsss enabled optimisation of the sl <dig> genome annotation. where transcription was observed in regions where no gene was previously annotated the artemis genome browser and annotation tool  was used to search for potential orfs possessing upstream shine-dalgarno sequences and putative homologues were identified using blast . we applied a similar procedure to re-annotate start codons where the tss was found to be downstream of the previously annotated start. these procedures resulted in the re-annotation of  <dig> start codons , the identification of  <dig> potential new orfs , and the re-designation of  <dig> orfs previously annotated in different reading frames. five of the new orfs  were predicted to be small toxic peptides of the type  <dig> toxin-antitoxin systems found in e. coli  <cit> .

promoter analysis of transcriptional start sites
the drna-seq identification of tsss for the majority of the sl <dig> genome enabled us to undertake a meme based analysis of the promoter regions to identify conserved sequences that may represent binding sites for transcriptional regulatory proteins . in order to analyse promoter regions,  <dig> nt sequences upstream of, and including the tsss, were extracted for all of the  <dig> tsss identified upstream of sl <dig> chromosomal and slp1- <dig> orfs . the database of promoters was analysed using meme to identify conserved motifs. from this analysis a conserved σ <dig>  binding site  was identified for  <dig> promoters . this consensus sequence closely matches the e. coli consensus σ <dig>  binding site  except for decreased conservation at the - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> positions. a functional category analysis revealed that the highest percentage of promoters that contained conserved - <dig> regions were upstream of genes encoding vitamins and cofactors , and the lowest percentage encoded motility and chemotaxis related genes . we found that just over half of the pathogenesis-related genes  contained a conserved - <dig> region including the major regulators of spi <dig> and spi <dig>  hila, hild, ssra and ssrb. by searching  <dig> nt sequences upstream of the  <dig> promoters we were also able to identify a conserved - <dig> region  for  <dig> promoters . a functional analysis of the promoters containing a conserved - <dig> motif  revealed that by far the highest category  belonged to genes related to cell division .

the drna-seq derived promoter database was also exploited to perform a meme analysis of all of the orf promoters to identify candidate and known targets for the alternative sigma factors σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig> & σ <dig>  firstly, a position specific probability matrix  was derived by meme analysis for each of e. coli alternative sigma factors from a promoter dataset from regulondb http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/. the pspm was then interrogated with fimo  with a default p-value cut-off of  <dig>  to identify sigma factor specific promoters from the drna-seq promoter database. fimo identified candidate binding sites for σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig> & σ <dig> factors at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> promoters respectively . our analysis was able to identify the majority of the genes previously shown to be dependent on sigma factors  <cit> . the published genes shown to be dependent on alternative sigma factors are indicated in additional file 2: table s <dig>  a meme analysis was performed on the remaining  <dig> promoters that did not contain identifiable potential sigma factor motifs. the analysis identified a conserved region for  <dig> promoters which was similar to the - <dig> motif, but contained a longer  region between the first conserved t of the - <dig> motif  and the first nucleotide of the tss . a functional categorisation of the  <dig> promoters revealed that a strikingly high percentage  belonged to genes involved in nucleoside and nucleotide interconversions .

5' leader regions and leaderless mrnas
canonical bacterial mrnas contain a 5' untranslated region  upstream of the initiation codon. as a minimal requirement, this region contains the shine-dalgarno  ribosome binding site , and may contain additional sequence motifs required for efficient ribosome binding  <cit> . in addition, many mrnas include longer 5' leader regions which may possess regulatory functions. the structure and sequence of 5' leader regions can affect gene expression by modulating the synthesis of full length mrnas or via regulation of post-transcriptional processing   <cit> . in addition to the majority of mrnas, a few bacterial transcripts lack upstream utrs and are termed "leaderless transcripts". in such cases transcription starts at, or up to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the "a" residue of an aug start codon  <cit>  and the resulting transcripts lack a sd rbs. published examples include the ci repressor of bacteriophage λ  <cit> , and the tetr gene of transposon tn <dig>  <cit> . both the cl and tetr genes encode relatively low abundance regulatory proteins which is consistent with the reduced translation of genes lacking ribosomal binding sites  <cit> . interestingly sullivan et al  <cit>  recently showed that the leaderless mrna transcript of a regulatory gene, acur, , is transcribed at least as efficiently as downstream genes, but is translated at far lower levels, thus providing an elegant mechanism for differential control of operon-encoded protein levels. although previously thought to be rare, leaderless genes are now known to be fairly common in prokaryotes and in the archaea, where as many as 69% of protein coding transcripts are leaderless  <cit> . our drna-seq analysis identified  <dig> completely leaderless mrnas where transcription started precisely at the a residue of the aug start codon. a further  <dig> genes contained a leader of between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length but lacked a sd sequence . functional analysis of these  <dig> leaderless genes showed that  <dig> encoded transcriptional regulators , expected to be expressed at relatively low levels,  <dig> encoded membrane proteins which are also often required at low levels, and  <dig> were related to pathogenicity functions .

tss mapping of s. typhimurium wild-type and ΔrelaΔspot strains revealed considerable variation in the length of mrna 5' leader regions ranging from 0- <dig> nt with a peak at  <dig> nt and median of  <dig> nt . we discovered that  <dig> genes were synthesised from one or more mrnas containing 5' leaders >  <dig> nt in length, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms associated with long 5' leaders are widely used by s. typhimurium. as has been reported for e. coli  <cit> , no global link between the length of the 5' leader and the functional category of the encoded protein was observed . however, some of the longest s. typhimurium 5' leaders were associated with genes involved in global and virulence gene regulation, including hfq , lrha , invf , rpos  and hild . one of the longest 5' leaders  was transcribed from one of the three promoters regulating the expression of the rna chaperone hfq . the e. coli hfq gene is also transcribed from  <dig> promoters and the tsss identified by primer extension exactly match our drna-seq predicted tsss in s. typhimurium  <cit> . the distal hfq promoter directing the longest 5' leader is σ <dig> dependent in e. coli and a clear σ <dig> consensus sequence was found in the corresponding s. typhimurium promoter. although the role of the leader in regulating gene expression has not yet been defined we found that this promoter was repressed by ppgpp .

operon prediction
operons were identified during manual inspection of the strand-specific drna-seq data . we found no difference in the operon structures determined from the wild-type and ΔrelaΔspot genomes . the majority of 5' ends of operons were assigned from the primary tss at the start of the first gene or from tss's located within the first gene of the operon . a further criterion for identification was the presence of 3' utrs located at the ends of operons. our inspection identified  <dig> monocistronic transcripts and  <dig> polycistronic operons resulting in a mean of  <dig>  genes per operon. we compared our operon map to operons predicted using door . door predicts operons based on a comparison of  <dig> prokaryotic organisms and accuracy can reach  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the b. subtilis and e. coli genomes respectively . door analysis of the s. typhimurium sl <dig> genome predicted  <dig> operons. our comparison of drna-seq to door predicted operons identified 60%  with an exact match and  <dig>  new operons, not predicted by door. we found 36%  of the operons identified from our drna-seq data were either extended or shortened  compared to the door predicted operons. in these cases we found that the drna-seq data identified tsss that were located within operons predicted by door . since the door algorithm does not take into consideration tss information, we suggest that our drna-seq identified operons are likely to be more accurate than the door predicted operon structures.

drna-seq identification of srna expression in s. typhimurium
manual inspection of the drna-seq transcriptome of the wild-type and ΔrelaΔspot strains identified a total of  <dig> predicted and known srnas and we discovered a further  <dig> new candidate srnas . we validated expression of  <dig> known ,  <dig> predicted  and  <dig> new candidate srnas  using northern blotting , and verified the presence of conserved - <dig> and - <dig> regions for the known and predicted srnas  <cit> . in order to further validate the s. typhimurium new candidate and predicted srnas we determined whether they were conserved within the recently published s. typhi ncrna transcriptome  <cit> . of the  <dig> newly identified s. typhi srnas,  <dig> srna homologues were found within the sl <dig> genome. of the  <dig> homologues,  <dig> new candidate srnas,  <dig> predicted srna and  <dig> asrna  were expressed in sl <dig> under the growth conditions used in this study . interestingly 19% of the known, predicted and new candidate srnas have secondary tsss, indicating that they may be subject to differential regulation . finally, we predicted intrinsic transcriptional terminators for  <dig> new candidate srnas and using targetrna software  we were also able to predict potential targets   <cit> .

extensive antisense transcription in s. typhimurium
antisense rnas  have been shown to be particularly abundant in eukaryotes, and recently a large proportion of the primary tsss have been shown to be antisense to orfs in e. coli and h. pylori, suggesting that asrnas have a widespread regulatory function in bacteria  <cit> . the drna-seq analysis detected  <dig> potential asrnas in s. typhimurium which were located directly opposite to coding regions of chromosomal genes . we also annotated ncrnas which were within or close to the 3' and 5' utrs of genes but which could not unambiguously be identified as asrnas according to our strict definition . finally, we found  <dig> ncrnas which were located in intergenic regions  where one or both of the flanking genes were located on the opposing or same strand of the ncrna . for validating the presence of selected candidate antisense and ncrnas in rna samples two methods were used, northern blotting and the more sensitive adapter assisted pcr. we verified the presence of  <dig> candidate asrnas, slasrna <dig> and slasrna <dig> . slasrna <dig> is opposite to the sipa orf, which encodes a spi <dig> effector protein and slasrna <dig> is opposite to the ycfq orf which encodes a putative transcriptional repressor . the presence of  <dig> candidate ncrnas were also verified . the  <dig> candidate ncrnas were chosen to be representative of the various locations of ncrnas on the genome with respect to adjacent genes and included putative transcripts found opposite to either the 5' or 3' ends of genes or classified as opposite intergenic . the detection of antisense and ncrnas using these techniques suggests that the observed antisense transcriptional initiation from the drna-seq data is not an artefact of library construction. a functional analysis of the genes opposite to asrnas revealed that the most highly represented categories contained genes related to pathogenic or chemotaxis and motility functions . similar to the tsss located directly upstream of protein coding orfs, we found that 79% of the candidate asrna transcripts started with a purine residue . this provides further evidence that the asrnas are primary transcripts rather than processing fragments or artefacts of the sequencing protocol, and reflects a recent study in e. coli where it was shown that 74% of the asrna transcripts began with a purine  <cit> .

a meme analysis of the  <dig> asrna tsss revealed a strongly conserved - <dig> binding site in  <dig> promoters , however the - <dig> site was only weakly conserved . since the - <dig> region has been shown to enhance stability of the rnap-promoter complex, this could suggest that the majority of asrnas in s. typhimurium are a consequence of promiscuous transcription initiation, as has been suggested for e. coli and eukaryotes  <cit> . one of the mechanisms by which asrnas opposing 5'utrs may inhibit translation is by obscuring the ribosome binding site   <cit> . none of the ncrnas we identified which were opposite to 5'utrs appeared to obscure the rbs, however, the short illumina read lengths may preclude this possibility. alternately, the ncrna may prevent transcription via transcriptional interference or attenuation  <cit> . indeed, some of the genes that were opposite to asrnas were transcriptionally silent, suggesting a possible role for asrnas in their regulation . interestingly we found candidate asrnas and ncrnas to 41% of the rrna genes ; similarly in h. pylori, ~28% of the trna and rrna genes were found to have antisense tsss  <cit> . in addition to stable rna genes, we discovered putative candidate asrnas to  <dig> virulence genes,  <dig> and  <dig> of which are located on the opposite strand to spi <dig> and spi <dig> encoded genes . their potential role in regulating the expression of these virulence genes is currently being investigated.

defining ppgpp-dependent gene expression using drna-seq
the drna-seq analysis of ppgpp-dependent gene expression identified  <dig> ppgpp-dependent alternative tsss . a functional analysis of the ppgpp-dependent alternative tsss revealed that  <dig> were upstream of genes involved in dna degradation or repair. however, the majority of the genes that were of known function  were found to be involved in metabolic processes, e.g., pykf which encodes pyruvate kinase is a key glycolytic enzyme, and also able to act as phosphor-donor for nucleoside diphosphates under anaerobic conditions [ <cit> ; figure  <dig>  additional file 2: table s1).

although conventional rna-seq techniques have been reported to show highly variable coverage across genes and operons, technical modifications have allowed quantitative gene expression studies to be successfully undertaken  <cit> . for example, perkins et al  <cit>  used a strand-specific rna-seq analysis to define the ompr regulon and validated their results by comparison with conventional microarray experiments. indeed, our drna-seq data shows that it was possible to observe clear differences in spi <dig> gene expression between the wild-type and ΔrelaΔspot strains . the expression level of a promoter was determined by calculating the number of non-enriched reads mapped between the primary tss and  <dig> nt downstream of the tss; ppgpp-activated expression was defined as 4-fold or higher transcript levels in the wild-type compared to the ΔrelaΔspot strain. ppgpp-repressed expression was defined as 4-fold or higher transcript levels in the ΔrelaΔspot strain compared to the wild-type strain. . the drna-seq data revealed that of the genes showing differential expression in the ΔrelaΔspot strain the majority of sl <dig> orfs were ppgpp-repressed , which may support the suggested role of ppgpp as a passive repressor of transcription  <cit> . it is possible that the number of ppgpp activated genes was overestimated due to protection of transcripts from degradation by the increased numbers of ribosomes found in ppgpp <dig> strains growing at low growth rates . however, since we determined gene expression levels by estimating read numbers from the first  <dig> nt upstream of the tss, and the median length of the 5'utr was  <dig> nt, any potential effects on expression levels due to ribosome protection will be limited. in order to validate our drna-seq based determination of ppgpp-dependent gene expression, we compared the ppgpp-repressed and activated gene sets obtained from drna-seq to the filtered ppgpp-dependent gene sets obtained from a whole orf microarray experiment performed under the same growth conditions and using the same strains . of the drna-seq derived ppgpp-repressed and activated genes that were present in the filtered microarray data, 75% and 84% of these were also ppgpp-repressed and activated in the microarray dataset . the total number of ppgpp-dependent genes was higher in the drna-seq data compared to the microarray data,  reflecting the greater dynamic range of differential expression obtained from drna-seq, as has previously been observed  <cit> .

compiled from additional file 2: tables s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> & s <dig> 

in order to determine the roles of ppgpp-dependent genes we performed a functional category analysis . we assigned the ppgpp-dependent genes into  <dig> functional categories. the largest ppgpp-repressed functional categories contained genes related to fatty acid and lipid metabolism, including peptidoglycan metabolism which play a role in the alterations to cell wall structure that occur at the late-log phase of growth. as well as the expected ppgpp-repression of translation related genes, we also observed repression of genes within the categories of pyrimidine and purine metabolism, and dna/rna interactions, replication and metabolism. these ppgpp-dependent processes are likely related to adaptation to the decreased growth rate that occurs at late-log phase. we also note that  <dig> transcriptional regulators were ppgpp-repressed suggesting that some ppgpp-dependent repression may occur via indirect mechanisms. it has been shown that ppgpp-repressed ribosomal rna genes contain gc-rich discriminator regions located between the tss and - <dig> regions that play a role in destabilisation of the rnap-promoter complex  <cit> . a meme analysis revealed that 66% of the genes that were ppgpp-repressed by greater than 16-fold contained a conserved  <dig> nt long gc rich discriminator regions and a weblogo analysis  showed a tendency towards c rather than g residues in all  <dig> positions . the remaining 34% of the highly ppgpp-repressed genes did not contain gc rich discriminator regions and may therefore be indirectly regulated.

of the ppgpp-activated genes, by far the largest functional category contained pathogenicity-related genes , which supports our previous microarray based analysis of ppgpp-dependent virulence gene regulation in s. typhimurium  <cit> . we also found  <dig> ppgpp-activated genes to possess regulatory functions. these include rtsa and flhd which encode major transcriptional activators of spi <dig> and flagella biosynthesis respectively  <cit> . previous work has shown that ppgpp-activated genes such as amino acid biosynthetic genes tend to contain at-rich discriminator regions which allow optimal binding with the σ-subunit of rnap  <cit> . in confirmation, a meme comparison of the ppgpp-activated genes revealed a tendency towards at-rich discriminator regions , however no conserved motifs could be identified using meme.

ppgpp-dependent expression of non-coding rnas
of the total known and predicted srnas we found that 18% of the tsss  were ppgpp-dependent out of a total of  <dig> start sites, and 25%  of the new candidate srnas were ppgpp-dependent out of a total of  <dig> start sites . this is less than the proportion of ppgpp-dependent tsss identified for sl <dig> chromosomal orfs . similar ppgpp dependent control of small non-coding rna abundance has been observed in other bacteria including rhizobium etli and staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . of the total number of ppgpp-dependent known, predicted and new candidate srnas,  <dig> were elevated and  <dig> repressed by ppgpp . as noted previously, a characteristic of ppgpp-repressed genes is the presence of a gc rich discriminator region located between the tss and the - <dig> region; however, there was no clear correlation between the gc content of the srna discriminator region and fold-repression or activation by ppgpp . this suggests that the majority of ppgpp repressed srnas may be indirectly regulated, or the size of the dataset was too small to identify a conserved motif. we confirmed the drna-seq defined ppgpp-activation of of  <dig> srnas  by northern blotting, one of which  was previously found to be ppgpp-dependently elevated  <cit>  . we also confirmed the drna-seq defined ppgpp-repression of rpra .

of the  <dig> asrnas that were directly opposite orfs, we note that  <dig> were ppgpp-dependently elevated and  <dig> repressed . this represents a total of 21% of the candidate asrnas and is similar to the percentage of ppgpp-dependent srnas. interestingly we note that antisense transcripts to the sipa and invh genes were ppgpp-activated by  <dig>  and 17-fold respectively. the remaining  <dig> start sites assigned to ncrnas,  showed a similar level of ppgpp-dependency to the antisense and srna tsss .

discussion
we have determined the tsss for 78% of the s. typhimurium orfs during growth conditions in which model the extracellular virulence gene expression programme . to date this is the most extensive and accurate map of the tsss for this bacterium. our analysis also identified secondary tsss for many genes and operon structures. our meme based promoter analysis of the first genes of operons identified conserved regions in the promoters which were found to closely resemble consensus binding sites for σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig> & σ <dig> factors; many of the predicted sigma factor-dependent genes had previously been experimentally verified in either e. coli or salmonella. we verified the expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted srnas and  <dig> out of  <dig> known srnas  <cit>  and also extended the repertoire of srnas encoded within the s. typhimurium genome by  <dig>  of the predicted srnas we were unable to verify, it is possible that they were not expressed under the growth condition studied here. we also observed that the location of the tsss of a subset of the predicted srnas did not correspond to the predicted start sites; from this we infer the bioinformatic approach used to identify the tsss may require experimental-based refinements to enhance accuracy. we identified  <dig> candidate antisense transcripts for the s. typhimurium genome for which we defined a conserved - <dig> hexamer upstream of the tss. although from this study, we cannot rule out the possibility that the expression of asrnas are a result of promiscuous transcription, other work suggests this is not the case, at least for h. pylori  <cit> .

our drna-seq approach to identifying ppgpp-dependent transcription was validated by comparison with a microarray-based determination of the ppgpp-dependent transcriptome performed under identical growth conditions. the gc rich discriminator region located between the tss and - <dig> region of ppgpp-repressed genes has been shown to play a role in destabilising the rnap-ppgpp complex of rrna promoters  <cit> . we were able to correlate decreased transcript levels of ppgpp-repressed genes with the abundance of gc residues within the discriminator region  <cit> . our data showed no correlation between at content of the discriminator region and the level of ppgpp-activation. however in agreement with da costa et al  <cit> , we did find that in general, ppgpp-activated genes contained a higher overall discriminator at content. interestingly we note that spi <dig> and spi <dig> encoded genes contain at-rich discriminator regions and the only sigma factor known to contribute to spi <dig> expression is σ70; this suggests the possibility of a direct activation of spi <dig> regulatory genes by ppgpp, rather than via sigma factor competition, as has already been suggested  <cit> .

many regulons controlled by alternative sigma factors, including σ <dig> and σ <dig> are poorly induced in cells lacking ppgpp  <cit> . in order to determine whether this was also the case for s. typhimurium, we analysed our alternative sigma factor promoter database for ppgpp-dependency. we found that almost all the genes belonging to the σ <dig> and σ <dig> regulons and more than half of the σ <dig> -dependent genes were ppgpp-repressed. in contrast, the σ <dig> regulon showed no tendency towards ppgpp-activation or repression . previous work has also shown that, in contrast to e. coli, ppgpp does not control rpos levels in s. typhimurium during late-log and stationary phase growth  <cit> . we conjecture that the ppgpp-repression of some of the alternative sigma factor regulons may represent an adaptation to favour σ <dig> dependent virulence gene expression under the stex growth conditions studied here.

it is generally accepted that elevated levels of ppgpp during amino acid starvation  result in repression of stable rnas . consistent with this we observed repression of the rrna operons in the wild-type compared to the ΔrelaΔspot strain . however, all but one of the trna mono- and polycistronic operons showed elevated transcript levels in the wild-type compared to the ΔrelaΔspot strain; a similar ppgpp-dependent elevation of trna levels was found in stationary phase rhizobium etli relative to early exponential phase  <cit> . it is possible that elevation of trna levels could be a consequence of ppgpp-dependent differential processing or stability rather than direct ppgpp-dependent regulation. indeed trna has been reported to remain stable under starvation conditions that induce rrna degradation in e. coli  <cit> . in support of the possibility of ppgpp-dependent differential processing or stability of trnas we observed that expression of rnasep, a ribozyme responsible for 5' end processing of trnas, was ppgpp-activated in s. typhimurium . similarly, we note that the r. etli rnasep was also ppgpp-activated . we hypothesise that the ppgpp-dependent activation of rnasep may result in reduced trna processing in the ΔrelaΔspot strain and subsequent removal of incorrectly processed trnas via rna quality control mechanisms  <cit> .

for the known and predicted srnas described in this study, a meme analysis was able to identify conserved - <dig>  and - <dig>  regions upstream of the predicted tsss . a manual inspection of the smaller new candidate srna dataset identified at rich - <dig> hexamers in 69% of the promoters . a manual inspection of all of the srna promoters described in this study failed to find any of the well-defined alternative sigma factor binding motifs and in fact only four srnas,  have so far been shown to be positively controlled by σe and σ <dig> in e. coli  <cit> . this suggests that, at least for the srnas transcribed under the growth conditions studied here, their expression is mostly σ <dig> dependent and perhaps reflects the major role srnas play in maintaining house-keeping functions and regulating virulence determinants. in contrast to the discriminator regions of ppgpp-repressed genes, we were unable to identify a conserved gc rich region in the set of ppgpp-repressed srnas. several of the ppgpp-repressed srnas  have been shown to act as repressors of genes encoding porins and outer membrane proteins  suggesting that ppgpp may indirectly activate these target genes. omps are important virulence factors and play a significant role in the bacterial adaptation to environmental conditions. other highly ppgpp-repressed srnas shown to play a role in salmonella virulence include isri, isrp and csrb. in addition, the srna chaperone, hfq was ppgpp-repressed by  <dig> -fold thus expanding the role of ppgpp in the regulation of salmonella virulence gene expression   <cit> . the isri and isrp srnas are expressed during infection of j <dig> macrophages  <cit> . isri is also expressed during stationary phase, and under low oxygen or magnesium levels; isrp is expressed under low magnesium and extreme acid conditions of ph <dig>   <cit> . csrb is part of the csr system shown to play a role in the regulation of invasion gene expression in s. typhimurium  <cit> . the spi <dig> encoded srna, invr, has previously been reported to be ppgpp-activated  <cit> . our data confirms invr as the most highly ppgpp-activated srna we detected under these growth conditions . although hfq has been shown to reduce the stability of invr  <cit> , we note that despite a  <dig> -fold ppgpp-dependent repression of hfq trasncript levels, invr remains highly ppgpp-activated. this suggests that ppgpp is able to modulate invr transcript levels via a hfq independent mechanism. invr represses synthesis of the major outer membrane protein, ompd  <cit> . it is suggested srnas such as invr have evolved to modulate omp levels, which can be deleterious to the cell  <cit> . ompd has also been shown to facilitate salmonella adherence to human macrophages and intestinal epithelial cell lines  <cit> . potential targets for the new ppgpp-dependent srnas include fabh, involved in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis,  <dig> genes involved in transport of sugars, nitrite, peptides and branched chain amino acids, and  <dig> transcriptional regulators, nadr, rob, and stm <dig> .

we discovered extensive antisense transcription within the s. typhimurium genome under the growth conditions studied here. similarly, a considerable abundance of asrna transcription was also discovered in e. coli and h. pylori  <cit> . interestingly, we observed candidate asrnas to several virulence genes from spi <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and identified  <dig> putative ncrnas which were classified as opposite intergenic between genes encoding several major spi <dig> regulators including hila and hild . one of the two candidate ncrnas between hila and hild  was highly ppgpp-activated by a factor of at least 34-fold. hild has been implicated in cross-talk between spi <dig> and spi <dig> expression  <cit> . under the growth conditions used in this study, spi <dig> is not highly expressed compared to spi <dig>  it is therefore tantalising to suggest that ncrnas may play a role in modulating expression of the stex and stin virulence gene expression programmes.

CONCLUSIONS
here we used drna-seq to define the transcriptomic architecture for an s. typhimurium wild-type and ppgpp <dig> strain during growth conditions where the invasion  genes are expressed. we identify the precise location of the tsss for 78% of the s. typhimurium genome, the reannotation of  <dig> start codons and the identification of  <dig> potential new orfs. the nucleotide position of the tsss enabled us to perform a promoter analysis, which resulted in the prediction of binding sites for  <dig> sigma factors, the analysis of 5' leader lengths and the prediction of  <dig> operons. the definition of the ncrna transcriptome resulted in confirmation of the expression of  <dig> predicted and known srnas under these growth conditions and the prediction of  <dig> new candidate srnas, for which potential targets were inferred. extensive asrna transcription was also discovered for  <dig> candidate asrnas,  <dig> and  <dig> of which were opposite virulence genes and candidate srnas respectively. the drna-seq predicted ppgpp-dependent tsss and ppgpp-dependent expression for the sl <dig> genome and we showed that ppgpp is involved in regulating an average of 20% of s. typhimurium ncrna expression.
