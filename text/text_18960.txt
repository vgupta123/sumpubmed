BACKGROUND
the gossypium  genus, composed of  <dig> species among which four provide the major raw material for one of the world's largest industries , has a large impact on our economy and everyday life. diploid cottons are classified into  <dig> genome types, denoted a-g and k, based on chromosome pairing relationships  <cit> . all diploid cotton species are believed to have shared a common ancestor about 5- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the cotton genome types diverged into genome groups that vary in haploid genome size from  <dig> mb in the k genome, to less than  <dig> mb in the d genome  <cit> , while retaining common chromosome number  and largely-collinear gene order  <cit> . the tetraploid cotton genome is thought to have formed by an allopolyploidy event about 1- <dig> million years ago, involving species similar to the modern new world d genome species g. raimondii   <cit>  or g. gossypioides   <cit>  and the old world a genome species g. herbaceum .

there exist at least a dozen published genetic maps for various gossypium crosses, most involving members of the superior-fiber-quality g. barbadense species crossed with high-yielding g. hirsutum. these maps collectively include >  <dig>  public dna markers . many thousands of additional ssrs have been described  <cit> , but only a subset of these have been mapped  <cit> . the most detailed sequence tagged site -based map, and a source of probes for many of the other maps, are reference genetic maps for diploid  and tetraploid . likewise, at refers to the a-subgenome of tetraploid cottons.) gossypium genomes that include respectively,  <dig> loci at  <dig>  cm  intervals based on  <dig> probes ; and  <dig> loci at  <dig>  cm  intervals detected by  <dig> probes   <cit> . a high degree of collinearity among the respective genome types permitted inference of the gene order of a hypothetical common ancestor of the at, dt, and d genomes for  <dig> loci identified by  <dig> probes, spanning  <dig>  cm  <cit> . additional maps that are particularly marker-rich and/or have been widely used as reference maps for qtl studies have been developed from three additional interspecific crosses  <cit> . other important resources include aneuploid substitution stocks that were derived from tetraploid genotypes tm- <dig>  × 3- <dig>   <cit>  and tm- <dig> × g. tomentosum  <cit> . together, monosomics and telosomics have been used to assign  <dig> of the  <dig> cotton linkage groups to chromosomes, and the remaining six linkage groups were assigned to chromosomes by translocation and fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping  <cit> .

cotton genetic maps have been employed in identification of diagnostic dna markers for a wide range of traits related to fiber yield and quality  <cit> ; drought tolerance  <cit> ; and resistance to diseases  <cit> , and pests  <cit> . interest in hybrid cottons in some countries has drawn attention to a nuclear restorer of cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> . morphological features such as the pubescence that is characteristic of g. hirsutum  <cit> , leaf morphology  <cit>  and color  <cit> , and unique features such as nectarilessness  <cit>  have also received attention. the value of cotton seed has led to interest in mapping variation in seed physical characteristics and nutritional value  <cit> . meta-analysis of multiple qtl mapping experiments by alignment to a common reference map has begun to reveal the genomic organization of trait variation  <cit> . although members of the d genome clade do not make spinnable fiber, genetic mapping has shown that the majority of fiber qtls mapped in tetraploid cotton fall on d genome  chromosomes, suggesting that the d genome has been crucial to the evolution of the higher fiber quality and yield of cultivated tetraploid cottons  <cit> .

toward the long-term goal of characterizing the spectrum of diversity among the  <dig> gossypium genome types and three polyploid clades, the worldwide cotton community has prioritized the d-genome species gossypium raimondii for complete sequencing  <cit> . gossypium raimondii is a diploid with a ~ <dig> mb genome  <cit> , the smallest genome in the gossypium genus at ~60% of the size of the diploid a genome and 40% of the tetraploids. it is largely inbreeding, and a largely-homozygous genotype has been used in both a reference genetic map  <cit>  and for a bac library . dna renaturation kinetics shows that 30-32% of the g. raimondii genome contains repetitive dna, with a kinetic complexity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp and an average iteration frequency of ~ <dig> copies per haploid genome  <cit> . this has been subdivided into a highly-repetitive component of about 5% of the genome, composed of elements in  <dig>  or more copies; and a middle-repetitive component accounting for 27% of the genome  <cit> . a random sampling of  <dig> % of the tetraploid cotton genome, enough to sample repetitive element families that occur in  <dig> or more copies, revealed only  <dig> d-genome-derived elements ranging in estimated copy number up to about  <dig> , versus dozens of a-genome-derived repeats at much higher copy numbers  <cit> . pilot sequencing studies  show that most d-genome repetitive dna families are sufficiently heterogeneous to be compatible with a whole-genome shotgun approach.

genetically anchored physical maps of large eukaryotic genomes have proven useful both for their intrinsic merit and as an adjunct to genome sequencing. in species where no whole-genome sequence is yet available, a physical map is a useful tool in a wide range of activities including comparative genomics and gene cloning. physical mapping also provides a method of genome assembly independent of a sequence, and is useful in contributing to and/or validating whole-genome shotgun sequences  <cit> . for bac-based sequencing of a genome, a physical map is a prerequisite. recent study of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of upland cotton   <cit>  suggests that physical mapping of polyploid cotton may be complicated by homoeologous genome fragments.

as an important step toward its genome-wide characterization, we describe here a genetically anchored, bac-based physical map for g. raimondii. by incorporating thousands of dna markers, the physical map is tightly integrated with the rich history of cotton molecular genetics research described above, and expedites a host of studies of gossypium biology and evolution. moreover, comparison of the physical map to the sequences of arabidopsis thaliana and vitis vinifera shows promise for utilizing translational genomic approaches in better understanding the structure, function, and evolution of this important genome and its resident genes.

RESULTS
bac library
the gossypium raimondii bac library used in physical mapping consists of  <dig>  clones. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based examination of  <dig> noti digested clones indicates a mean insert size of  <dig> kb. of note, there was little variation in insert size among clones . three of the  <dig> interpretable noti-digested clones  appear to be false positives. likewise, three of the  <dig> bac end sequences generated from the library exhibit homology to chloroplast dna  indicating that the methods employed in constructing the library  <cit>  were successful in keeping chloroplast contamination low. collectively, the library affords 10× coverage of the g. raimondii genome.

agarose-based fingerprints and hicf
two different types of fingerprints were employed in this study: a preliminary assembly used agarose-based fingerprinting and an improved assembly resulted from re-fingerprinting a subset of bacs using hicf. the entire  <dig> -clone gr bac library was fingerprinted using slight modification of established agarose-based fingerprinting methods  <cit> . preliminary assembly formed  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons at a tolerance value of  <dig> and cutoff value of 1e- <dig>  the average agarose-based fingerprint band number of individual bacs was  <dig> . band number distribution across the library is shown in figure 1a. a total of  <dig> bacs failed to produce usable fingerprints.

two terminal bacs from each end of the largest  <dig> agarose contigs  from the preliminary assembly were fingerprinted using hicf. the average hicf band number per bac was initially  <dig> . hicf batches with extremely high or low band numbers  were re-fingerprinted. the average band number dropped to  <dig>  these  <dig>  bacs formed  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. the final band number distribution is shown in figure 1b.

overgo hybridizations
thousands of probes were applied to the gr library using a multiplex hybridization scheme . a total of  <dig> probes from arabidopsis genes, cotton ests, and genetic markers showed hybridization signal attributable to one or more bacs by this approach. on average, each probe hit  <dig>  bacs. a total of  <dig> probes hit more than  <dig> bacs and are considered highly repetitive. to minimize false associations, probes with > <dig> hits were not used in the contig assembly process, and probes with > <dig> hits were not used in the contig anchoring process . thus,  <dig> probes  were integrated into the assembly using the cpm table in fpc: stringency  was relaxed by  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> denary  intervals when  <dig>   <dig> and 3+ common markers were found between two bacs.

integrated assembly
since agarose-based fingerprinting and hicf use different sets of restriction enzymes, a different band-calling scheme, and have different error rates and band size tolerances, data from these two different methods cannot be merged directly. further, while we targeted hicf to contig-terminal bacs, it would be imprudent to declare a join in the agarose assembly whenever hicf suggests a merge of contig-terminal bacs, overlooking potential false joins in hicf. to circumvent this, if two agarose contig-terminal bacs were suggested to be joined by hicf, we lowered the cutoff value for joining agarose contig-terminal bacs by two denary intervals, e. g. when the overall cutoff was set to 1e- <dig>  we would accept an overlap at the cutoff at 1e- <dig> if the two bacs were found in the same hicf contig. the agarose assembly was thus reassembled, only forming a merged contig if it was supported by both data types , and integrating  <dig> hybridization markers based on  <dig> overgos.

collectively, the agarose fingerprints, targeted hicf fingerprints, and overgo hybridization data joined a total of  <dig>  bacs into  <dig> contigs, leaving  <dig>  singletons. based on the average insert size estimate of  <dig> kb, and an estimated genome size of  <dig> mbp  <cit> , the  <dig>  bacs in contigs provide ~ <dig> × coverage of the gr genome. the majority of contigs  contain between  <dig> and  <dig> bacs. the distribution of bac numbers per contig is shown in additional file  <dig> 

singletons differed in several ways from bacs in contigs. the average agarose-based fingerprint band number was  <dig>  for singletons, versus  <dig>  for bacs in contigs. a total of  <dig>  singletons contained less than  <dig> bands. this could reflect either shorter length of singleton bacs, or the presence of tandem repeats that produce fingerprint bands that comigrate, reducing the scoreable band number and perhaps contributing to failure of some bacs to form contigs . a total of  <dig> overgo probes hit singleton bacs, among which  <dig> overgos were repetitive and  <dig> were low copy . compared to the probes that hit bacs in contigs , singletons show some enrichment in repetitive dna content. a total of  <dig> singletons were identified as possible cross-well contaminations.

anchoring contigs to the cotton consensus map
after filtering out  <dig>  repetitive overgo probes that hit more than  <dig> bacs in the gr library, and  <dig> bacs  with more than  <dig> markers hybridized as suspected hybridization artifacts, the remaining probes and bacs produced  <dig>  bac-probe pairs. a total of  <dig> of these were produced by bacs that were not in contigs ;  <dig> of the markers on contigs were "weak anchors" produced by a single bac-probe pair for the contig. weak anchors were not used in aligning the contigs onto the genetic map. the remaining  <dig>  bac-probe pairs derive from  <dig> probes, and were distributed in  <dig> contigs.

a 'consensus' cotton genetic map built from the at, dt and d genome genetic maps contains  <dig> homologous groups made up of  <dig> loci based on  <dig> unique sequence tags  <cit> . among these,  <dig> have probes designed . after filtering out probes with > <dig> hits in the library,  <dig> loci on the consensus map have anchored  <dig> contigs. . on average, each marker anchored  <dig>  contigs.

aligning contigs to arabidopsis thaliana and vitis vinifera whole-genome sequences
a total of  <dig> bacs selected from the ends of the largest  <dig> contigs from the preliminary assembly were used for paired-end sequencing. the resulting  <dig>  high-quality sequences, along with the  <dig> low copy probes , were used in comparing the gr contigs to arabidopsis thaliana  and vitis vinifera  chromosomes.

bac end-sequences  and the source sequences of the hybridization probes were aligned to the at and vv whole-genome sequences using blastn. a total of  <dig> sequences  had between  <dig> and  <dig> blast hits in the at genome, and  <dig> sequences  have between  <dig> and  <dig> hits in the vv genome. 

a total of  <dig> contigs were aligned to arabidopsis chromosomes,  <dig> to vitis chromosomes, and  <dig> to both . all  <dig> that aligned contained  <dig> cb units  per contig on average, about 50% larger than the overall average contig size . based on an estimated size of  <dig> bps per band , these contigs cover a minimum of 13%  and 11%  of the gr genome, noting that band numbers somewhat underestimate contig sizes because both very large and very small bands are excluded from bandcalling. a second estimate of coverage of the target genomes by aligned contigs was obtained by adding up the distances between anchor marker blast matches and excluding overlaps. this suggests that  <dig> % of the arabidopsis genome and  <dig> % of the vitis genome is covered by aligned gr contigs. some contigs have significant association with two or more positions on a target genome. the distributions of contigs along at and vv chromosomes are shown in figure  <dig>  contigs are more likely to be anchored to two or more locations in at than vv , consistent with the fact that the arabidopsis lineage has experienced two more whole-genome duplication  events than grape  <cit> .

the gr contigs anchored on vv are not evenly distributed across the chromosomes, but rather are clustered in several regions/chromosome arms that tend to have higher than average gene densities. gene density distribution across the vitis genome was extracted by counting the number of genes in  <dig> kb bins along the chromosomes. gene density is largely uniform across the arabidopsis chromosomes except for the centromeric regions; while in the vitis genome, we observed greater heterogeneity of gene density. the regions on which we were able to anchor gr contigs  had an average of  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb window, versus an average of  <dig>  for the remainder of the genome. among the 30% of vv 'windows' with highest gene density,  <dig> % were covered by gr contigs; versus  <dig> % of the genome as a whole.

nature of repetitive probes
a total of  <dig> probes are classified as highly-repetitive . these came from several sources:  <dig> were derived from cotton est sequences ,  <dig> were derived from genes that are low-copy in arabidopsis , and  <dig> were derived from cotton rflp probes used in genetic mapping . six of the highly repetitive cotton overgo sequences were found to be located within known repetitive elements using repbase http://www.girinst.org/repbase/. the overgo with the most hits  is in a helitron. the remaining five were from two hat-like dna transposons, one enspm element, one erv/erv <dig> element and one gypsy element. four of the  <dig> highly repetitive pcr-based probe sequences contain repetitive elements. the three arabidopsis genes from which highly repetitive overgos were designed  showed no known repetitive elements in their sequences, which might indicate cotton lineage-specific gene multiplications. given that repbase does not include a comprehensive set of cotton repetitive sequences , it is likely that the remaining highly repetitive overgos that did not match repetitive sequences from repbase may reveal cotton elements not previously known to be repetitive.

low-copy and repetitive dna loci were concentrated in different regions of the genome
a total of  <dig> contigs contain bacs to which one or more probes hybridized. probes were classified as low copy , moderately repetitive , or highly repetitive . accordingly, contigs were tentatively classified as repetitive or low-copy based on the ratio of repetitive probes versus low-copy probes hybridized to each contig. a total of  <dig> contigs contain only repetitive probes, and  <dig> contigs contains mostly  low copy probes. because a large number of the probes are designed from cotton est sequences or arabidopsis genes, contigs with relatively more hybridization anchors from low copy probes and relatively fewer from repetitive probes are likely to be gene rich. the  <dig> low-copy probe enriched contigs contain  <dig> of the  <dig> non-repetitive probes. the majority of the low-copy probe enriched contigs  are anchored to the cotton consensus map . by comparison, only  <dig> %  of contigs overall could be anchored to the consensus map.

repetitive contigs are slightly shorter than contigs enriched in low copy probes . this could be caused by co-migrating fragments produced by the repetitive sequences that reduce the total number of bands.

low-copy probe enriched contigs appear to be largely euchromatic
among the  <dig> contigs that showed microsynteny to vv chromosomes,  <dig> are enriched in low-copy probes and only  <dig> are repetitive probe enriched. similarly, among the  <dig> contigs that showed microsynteny to at chromosomes,  <dig> were enriched in low copy probes, and only  <dig> are repeat-enriched. this is consistent with our prior findings in other taxa that microsynteny tends to be preserved in gene-rich euchromatic regions but not in repeat-rich heterochromatic regions  <cit> . we tacitly assume that the  <dig> repeat-enriched contigs are likely to be largely from heterochromatic regions of the genome and the  <dig> low-copy sequence-enriched contigs are likely to be from euchromatic regions of the genome. the  <dig> low-copy contigs can be estimated to cover 26% of the genome based on the estimated genome size of  <dig> m and average band size of  <dig> bp. based on the 68% of the genome estimated to be low-copy by renaturation kinetics <cit> , these contigs may cover about  <dig> % of the low-copy dna. contigs aligned to vv and at genomes contains  <dig>  and  <dig>  of all non-repetitive probes. the low copy probes that were unable to align were partly due to the limitation of blast in searching across distant related species and the variation in gene density in vv genome.

consequences of ancient duplications in the arabidopsis thaliana genome
to illustrate the alignment of gr contigs on the at and vv genomes, ctg <dig> was used as an example. the contig is anchored to a single vv chromosomal location at about  <dig>  mb on chr <dig>  and to four different locations on the at genome, at  <dig> mb on chr <dig>   <dig>  mb on chr <dig>   <dig> mb on chr <dig> and  <dig>  mb on chr <dig> respectively . these four at regions were previously shown to be paralogous segments created by two rounds of whole-genome duplication  <cit> . the chromosomal region in vitis has also been identified using mcscan  <cit> , to have conserved collinearity with the four at regions . ctg <dig> is anchored on cotton consensus homologous group  <dig>  at around  <dig> cm. based on cotton dna markers, this region has shown evidence of homology to arabidopsis α <dig> and α <dig> groups  <cit> .

the g. raimondii chloroplast
by aligning to the chloroplast dna sequence of upland cotton  using blast, bac-end sequences and probes likely to be of chloroplast origin were identified. ctg <dig> is identified as a chloroplast contig. the contig contains  <dig> bacs,  <dig> of which are "buried" in fpc, meaning they have nearly identical band patterns as other bacs in the contig, indicating very high similarity among these bacs. cov <dig>  an overgo probe designed from the sequence of the chloroplast psaj gene, hits  <dig> of the  <dig> bacs in the contig. three bacs from the contig have end sequences, all of which correspond to the published g. hirsutum chloroplast sequence . based on low-coverage genomic sequencing with some targeted finishing, a d-genome chloroplast sequence has been assembled and is being described 

go analysis of bes and shotgun sequences
the  <dig>  bes were analyzed using blast2go to obtain a distribution of functional gene groups. a total of  <dig> did not have significant hits using blastx against ncbi nr database,  <dig> of the sequences are annotated, and  <dig> were mapped, but not annotated. no significant differences were observed between the go distribution of bes and random shotgun sequences except that more genes involved in localization processes were represented in the random shotgun sequences. .

discussion
the first whole-genome physical map of a cotton species has provided new tools and information, and foreshadows the picture of cotton genome organization prior to the completion of the d-genome sequencing currently in progress. the genetically anchored contigs are potentially helpful in efforts such as gene cloning and local sequence analysis, by providing region-specific bac resources for marker development and chromosome walking. on a genomic level, comparative analysis between cotton, arabidopsis, and vitis genomes illustrates the potential for translational genomics across these species, and several regions with an unusually high degree of conserved collinearity may be interesting for further research.

several lines of evidence herein suggest that the g. raimondii genome is comprised of two qualitatively different components, specifically one that is gene-rich and recombinogenic with gene repertoire and order that is still recognizably similar to those in members of other angiosperm families , and another that is repeat-rich and recombinationally-recalcitrant with relatively few genes that are highly rearranged relative to their homologs in other taxa. this general picture of cotton genome organization is similar to the picture that emerged from comparison of two monocot genomes, rice and sorghum  <cit> .

curiously, we were able to anchor more contigs on the vitis genome despite the closer relationship of cotton to arabidopsis. this difference is attributable in part to differences in anchoring parameters , but also reflects the relatively slow evolution of vitis  <cit> , and highlights the value of the vitis genome as a botanical model for cross-taxon comparative genomic studies.

the present genome assembly remains somewhat fragmented and may be further improved as more information and new technology emerges. adding more genetically anchored sts to the bacs, as well as mapping of more bac-derived sequences will permit anchoring of more contigs to their corresponding chromosomal locations.

further improvements of the genetic-physical map
while contigs covering ~40% of the genome have been genetically anchored, a higher density of genetic markers may permit anchoring of many more contigs. some genetically mapped probes hit only singleton bacs and were not incorporated into the physical map in the interest of minimizing false positives. nearly  <dig> probes that hybridized to gr bacs are from sequences that have not yet been genetically mapped, so are not useful in linking the genetic and physical maps. designing new overgo probes from mapped sequence-tagged sites can be done recursively as more densely populated genetic maps become available. conversely, new ssr markers can be developed from bes and put onto the genetic map, which would help anchor more contigs and help confirm the position of those already anchored.

probes targeted at specific regions of interest
marker density on the physical map reflects efforts to enrich specific genomic regions containing genes of interest for dna markers. most prominent are probes aimed at the li <dig>  and li <dig>  genes of cotton. about  <dig> overgo probes were designed from genetic markers and est reads that showed relationship to the regions of these genes. this enrichment created "hotspots" where more gr contigs could be aligned to both arabidopsis and vitis . in the at genome, there is an excess of anchored gr contigs near the bottom of chromosome  <dig>  the upper and lower parts of chromosome  <dig>  and the tip of chromosome  <dig>  these four regions were identified in earlier studies  <cit>  to have been produced by two rounds of whole-genome duplication, all belonging to the consensus group β <dig>  likewise, the regions near the top of vv chromosome  <dig> and bottom of chromosome  <dig> anchor a higher than average number of gr contigs.

a closer look at these "hotspots" revealed that the majority of the contigs anchored here contain probes from the li <dig> and li <dig> regions. there are  <dig> contigs anchored in the at regions described above,  <dig>  of which contains li <dig> and/or li <dig> probes. in  <dig> out of these  <dig> cases, the li probes provided one or more anchor point in the microsynteny detection. in grape, a total of  <dig> contigs fell into the most densely anchored regions on grape chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and 13;  <dig>  of these contigs contain li <dig> or li <dig> probes of which  <dig> provided one or more anchor point in microsynteny detection. compared to the whole-genome average of 23%  contigs that contains li probes, these regions shows a significant enrichment in li contigs and the ability to align to the at and vv genomes.

this illustrates the potential use of the contig assembly in cross genome comparisons, and that the power to detect synteny and align contigs across genomes can be greatly increased by targeted enrichment of specific regions for hybridization probes.

the grape genome as a model
aligning physical map contigs with sequenced genomes has proven informative in several ways  <cit> . comparative mapping data and bes alignments to the human genome helped in assigning bovine physical map contigs to their respective chromosomes  <cit> . the pattern of sorghum physical map contigs along rice chromosomes has given empirical evidence that gene rearrangement is generally deleterious  <cit> . cross-species synteny information has also enabled us to make better use of the sequenced genome data on other genomes.

for cotton, arabidopsis is the most closely-related genome for which a sequence is published as of this writing. the rapid evolution of, and two additional wgd events in, the arabidopsis lineage may reduce our ability to align these respective genomes. the vitis genome, on the other hand, evolves relatively slowly  <cit>  and has experienced no wgd events apart from the hexaploidy  event that is likely to be shared by all dicots  <cit> . the grape genome might prove to be more useful than that of arabidopsis in comparative genomics across distantly related species.

one disadvantage of using the grape genome as a model for cotton lies in its relative low gene density compared to the arabidopsis genome. unlike sorghum and rice, where the euchromatic regions have a similar gene density in both genomes  <cit> , gene density is at least twice as high in arabidopsis as in vitis. gene density across the currently assembled grape pseudomolecules fluctuates from about  <dig> to  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb in higher gene density regions to  <dig> to  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb in lower gene density regions. similar analysis showed that gene density is uniformly  <dig> to  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb across the arabidopsis genome, except for the centromeric regions and a few low density points with  <dig> to  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb. this lower gene density in vitis reduces our ability to anchor cotton contigs, and look for synteny using contig information. here, we were able to anchor cotton contigs onto most of the gene dense regions of the vitis genome, but large parts of the low-gene-density chromosomal regions are not covered.

using the genetic-physical map in gene cloning
map-based cloning has always been a long and tedious process. the genetic-physical map provides a shortcut by which contigs spanning a target gene region can be readily identified through flanking markers. markers immediately upstream and downstream of a target gene can be used to identify neighboring anchored contigs, and sequencing of bacs within the contig could provide candidate genes warranting further study . in efforts to characterize a gene involved in cotton fiber development, we were able to identify a contig that anchors to the genetic region of interest using this method, and design new genetic markers very close to the gene .

in our efforts to anchor the contigs through probe hybridization, overgo probes were also designed from specific gene sequences . some probes were designed from specific gene families, e.g. cov <dig>  cov <dig>  cov <dig> and cov <dig> were designed from cotton cesa gene. bacs and contigs that contain these sequences were identified, which provide materials for study of these gene families. probes were also designed to identify contigs that include arabidopsis trichome gene homologs. table  <dig> shows a list of probes and contigs that is directly applicable to the study of specific genes.

the value of the physical map for positional cloning would be further enhanced by anchoring more contigs onto the genetic maps efficiently and accurately. we have provided a framework on which more than  <dig> contigs has been aligned. in genomic regions that are of high priority to specific research efforts , many unanchored contigs might be tentatively merged into the anchored contigs, given a lower stringency or higher tolerance for questionable clones, then seeking additional corroborative data such as additional bac ends, hybridization anchors, or targeted genetic mapping of hybridizing elements. for regions where no contigs have been anchored yet, a simple probing of the library using flanking genetic markers should be able to help build a local genetic-physical map. contigs upstream and downstream of a target contig can be identified by manually searching for similar contigs at a lower cutoff, and rebuilding the contigs for the region of interest.

microsynteny information permits one to utilize new ways of developing genetic markers targeted to a region of interest  <cit>  that may be of high value in translating functional information from botanical models to cotton. the contigs aligned to the at and vv genomes cover about 1/ <dig> of these respective genomes, primarily in regions that are likely to be gene-rich. earlier research has identified some arabidopsis genes with well-defined roles in trichome  development that approximately correspond to the locations of cotton fiber qtls. some of these genes are in regions which showed conserved organization with the gr physical map contigs. e.g. an α-tubulin gene  is found in a region spanned by contig <dig> and contig3177; the ttg <dig> gene, which is involved in trichome pattern formation  <cit> , is in a region spanned by contig937; the act <dig> gene, which involves in trichome morphogenesis  <cit> , is in a region spanned by contig908; the gl <dig> gene is spanned by contig <dig>  these anchorings may provide a good starting point to search for candidate genes and qtls with similar functions in cotton fiber development, and help elucidate the similarities and differences in trichome formation in different tissues.

average band number is crucial in agarose based fingerprinting
the use of both agarose based and hicf methods in this physical map assembly gave us the opportunity to directly compare these two methods that have been widely used in genome projects. using only the agarose based fingerprints, we obtained a large number of small contigs. to test if this is caused by the low band number, we estimated the expected contig number under our conditions. when cutoff = 1e- <dig>  the minimum matching band number required to call an overlap between two clones is  <dig> in our study. with a tolerance value of  <dig> and cutoff of 1e- <dig>  the expected contig number in the assembly would be over  <dig> if the average band number per clone is  <dig>  in other words, our agarose based contigging yielded the expected result.

the expected contig number drops rapidly with increased average band number. from the lander-waterman formula , if the average band number is increased to  <dig>  the expected contig number would be about  <dig>  with an average band number of  <dig>  one would expect only about  <dig> contigs. this should be an underestimation because we are not considering physical gaps and under-represented parts of the genome in the bac libraries, but nevertheless, shows how critical band numbers are to an agarose-based fingerprinting project. bacs with fewer than  <dig> bands offer too little information to form statistically-supported contigs, even with identical band patterns.

our success with using hicf in a targeted manner to improve the physical map stems from much higher band numbers. hicf merged contig-end bac pairs had average agarose band numbers that are not significantly different from the overall band number . the reason why they failed to join is due to the high percentage of matching bands needed to call an overlap. fpc was unable to call an overlap even if  <dig> bands were matching .

CONCLUSIONS
the first genetically anchored whole-genome physical map of a cotton species was built through integration of agarose-based fingerprinting and 'high information content fingerprinting' . integrating genetically-anchored overgo hybridization probes and bac end sequences permitted many physical map contigs to be aligned to a consensus cotton genetic map as well as arabidopsis and vitis genome sequences. the cotton genome appears to include two qualitatively different components, specifically one that is gene-rich and recombinogenic with gene repertoire and order still recognizably similar to those in members of other angiosperm families, and another that is repeat-rich and recombinationally-recalcitrant with relatively few genes that are highly rearranged relative to those of other angiosperms. while vitis appears to be a more informative comparator regarding cotton genome organization, translational genomics from arabidopsis offers singular benefits in identifying the functions of cotton genes. in summary, the physical map is  a link that connects genetic map information with physical sequences;  a means of validating/directing whole-genome shotgun sequencing assembly; and  a tool providing insight into the genome organization of cotton, in advance of a whole-genome sequence.
