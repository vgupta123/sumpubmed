BACKGROUND
anabaena sp. strain pcc  <dig>  is an obligate photoautotrophic cyanobacterium that reduces atmospheric nitrogen in terminally differentiated cells known as heterocysts  <cit> . approximately every tenth cell along a filament differentiates into a heterocyst under nitrogen-fixing conditions. three developmentally regulated dna rearrangements occur within the heterocyst chromosome which excise dna elements integrated within the nifd, fdxn and hupl genes  <cit> . the element interrupting the nifd gene is  <dig>  base pairs in length and carries its own site-specific recombinase, the xisa gene  <cit> . the nifd element is found in most heterocyst forming cyanobacteria integrated within the nifd gene  <cit> . it is absent from all non-heterocystous strains examined to date  <cit> . while factors driving the evolution of the nifd element and its associated genes remain obscure, an essential role in diazotrophic growth can be ruled out since an anabaena strain cured of the nifd element was shown to fix nitrogen under aerobic conditions in heterocysts of normal morphology  <cit> .

the complete dna sequence of the nifd element reveals little about the biological functions it encodes. nine open reading frames are known  only one of which can be identified by sequence homology: the first reported cyanobacterial cytochrome p <dig> gene, cyp <dig>  <cit> . the cyp <dig> gene is widely conserved in the heterocyst forming cyanobacteria including anabaena, nostoc and calothrix/fremyella. the amino acid sequence of cyp <dig> is most similar to the mammalian p <dig> family  <dig> fatty acid omega-hydroxylases and p450bm <dig> from bacillus megatarium, another fatty acid omega hydroxylase. however, the metabolic significance of fatty acid omega hydroxylation in bacteria remains obscure. even for the well-characterized p450bm <dig> enzyme, the identity of the in vivo substrate of this protein and the pathway involved are not known  <cit> . studies suggest n-alkanes act as multi-purpose microbial p <dig> inducers and our preliminary data suggested this was also true for cyp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, a biosensor for hexadecane detection based on changes in cyp <dig> mrna from anabeana variabilias has been described  <cit> . here we report on the pattern of expression of the cyp <dig> mrna and protein in anabaena  <dig>  substrate binding characteristics of cyp <dig>  the effects of alkanes on cellular morphology, and the distribution of cyp <dig> in vegetative cells versus heterocysts using electron microscopy.

RESULTS
hexadecane-dependent induction of cyp <dig> transcripts in nitrogen-fixing and ammonia-supplemented cultures
we first tested the effects of hexane, octane, dodecane and hexadecane on the growth of anabaena  <dig> cultures. all alkane additions in this study were carried out at  <dig> % , the recommended concentration for microbial p <dig> induction  <cit> . in preliminary experiments, we determined that anabaena  <dig> exhibited rapid chlorosis with  <dig> % hexane and octane. these treatments yielded only highly degraded rna and were not further analyzed . rna samples from control, dodecane and hexadecane treated cultures were size fractionated and hybridized with cyp <dig>  a psba <dig> specific probe was used to assess rna quality and for normalization.

the cyp <dig> probe identified a range of transcript sizes with a maximum of  <dig> kb seen in mrna from both nitrogen-fixing and ammonia supplemented anabaena  <dig> cultures fig.  <dig> and  <dig>  the size of the transcript identified by the cyp <dig> probe and the genetic organization of the nifd-element suggest that all of the open reading frames to the right of xisa on the nifd element are coordinately transcribed on a polycistronic mrna. in support of this idea, a probe internal to the orf <dig> coding region  identified the same range of transcript sizes . since the xisa mrna has not been detected with northern blots  <cit> , it is likely that the  <dig> kb transcript begins downstream of the xisa gene and terminates 3' to the orf designated adx in fig.  <dig> 

the psba <dig> gene, which encodes the d <dig> reaction center protein, was used as a load control and hybridization standard. as seen in fig.  <dig> and  <dig>  the psba <dig> probe identifies a discrete  <dig>  kb transcript in control rna as previously shown  <cit> . relative amounts of mrnas were estimated by densitometry of the scanned autoradiogram. exposure times for detection of the cyp <dig> transcript were  <dig> times longer than for the highly expressed psba <dig> mrna.

the ratio of the cyp110/psba <dig> signal intensities was  <dig>  fold higher in hexadecane-treated cultures in the nitrogen-fixing culture  while a  <dig> -fold increase was observed in the ammonium-supplemented culture . the dodecane treatment had little effect on cyp <dig> mrna levels in either nitrogen-fixing or ammonium supplemented cultures. similar results were obtained in  <dig> separate experiments with rna isolated from independent cultures. the doubling of steady-state cyp <dig> mrna levels in response to hexadecane treatment was independent of nitrogen status of the culture, consistent with previous data showing the entire nifd element is not required for nitrogen fixation in heterocysts  <cit> .

cyp <dig> protein is only detected in hexadecane-treated cultures and localized in the membrane fraction
the hexadecane effect on cyp <dig> gene expression was further examined using cyp110-specific antibodies to probe for the presence of p <dig> protein in nitrogen-fixing anabaena  <dig> cultures. as shown in fig. 3a, the  <dig> % hexadecane treatment resulted in the appearance of an immuno-reactive protein band of  <dig> kda that co-migrated with a purified cyp <dig> protein sample. the p <dig> protein band intensity increased at least  <dig> fold within  <dig> hours of treatment, and at least  <dig> fold  <dig> hours after treatment with hexadecane when compared to the background, zero-time expression shown in lane  <dig> . a western blot with protein samples from an untreated control culture failed to detect any immuno-reactive p <dig> protein . these results were replicated with  <dig> independent cultures.

heterologous expression of the cyp <dig> protein in e. coli produced a substantial amount of membrane associated p <dig> protein  <cit> . this is a clear distinction between cyp <dig> and its closest sequence homolog, p450bm <dig>  which has been extensively studied in part because it is a soluble p <dig> model protein  <cit> . to determine if cyp <dig> is membrane associated in anabaena  <dig>  protein from membrane and soluble fractions separated by centrifugation were subjected to western blot analysis. as shown in fig. 3d, the membrane fraction appeared to contain all of the immuno-reactive p <dig> protein in the anabaena  <dig>  this stands in contrast to p450bm <dig> and most other microbial p <dig> proteins, and in this regard, cyp <dig> more closely resembles the eukaryotic p <dig> proteins.

spectral characterization of cyp <dig> protein and substrate binding assay
absorption spectra studies were recorded for cyp <dig> protein expressed and purified from e. coli carrying a puc-based expression vector  <cit> . as shown in fig. 4a, the cyp <dig> protein has a typical cytochrome p <dig> absorbance profile in the visible region for the oxidized, reduced and carbon monoxide bound states. cyp <dig> also shows the characteristic peak at  <dig> nm in the co difference spectrum . we monitored the visible spectrum while titrating a cyp <dig> solution with tetradecanoic acid. as shown in fig. 4c, this resulted in a blue shift of the peak absorbance in the oxidized spectrum to  <dig> nm, similar to previously described p <dig> substrate-dependent type i spectral shifts. this spectral shift was the same in either buffer a or buffer a +  <dig> % deoxycholate. when buffer a was supplemented with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  no spectral shift was observed . the titration yields the binding constant  for each substrate producing a spectral shift. a typical difference spectrum generated from the titration and the resulting double reciprocal plot are shown in fig. 4d.

the calculated binding constants for the interaction of cyp <dig> with potential substrate molecules of different hydrocarbon chain length are listed in table  <dig>  for the saturated fatty acids tested, cyp <dig> displays the highest affinity for tetradecanoic acid with a ks of  <dig>  mm. the unsaturated fatty acids also bound well to cyp <dig>  overall, cyp <dig> had the highest affinity for alpha-linolenic acid  and arachidonic acid , long chain fatty acids with  <dig> and  <dig> double bonds, respectively. for comparison, p450bm <dig> has a ks of  <dig>  mm for arachidonic acid  <cit> . the ks values towards arachidonic acid for the mammalian cytochrome p450s from family  <dig> are in the same range  <cit> .

fatty amines and fatty amides are known to interact with p <dig> Ï‰-hydroxylases via type ii spectral shifts  <cit> , and this was also true for cyp <dig>  the minimal chain length for this interaction was  <dig> since n-butylamine did not cause a spectral shift while n-pentylamine did bind. there was a clear trend for tighter binding with longer hydrocarbon chain length, as the cyp110-dodecylamine interaction had the lowest tested ks value . cyp <dig> bound fatty amines  <dig> fold better than p450non, which has a binding constant of  <dig>  mm towards octylamine  <cit> . twelve-aminododecanoic acid causes a type i spectral shift instead of a type ii suggesting an altered mode of binding. lu et al.  <cit>  showed that terminal amino fatty acid derivatives interact weakly with the heme iron of cytochromes p <dig> 

the binding of cyp <dig> towards other fatty acid derivatives was also examined. table  <dig> displays a list of compounds that displayed no spectral shift, including fatty alcohols or saturated n-alkanes. no spectral shift was observed with 11- or 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid or with methyl laurate. the unsaturated fatty acid 11-dodecenoic acid was also tested with no shift observed. two other amines that did not display spectral shifts were the polyamine, putrescine, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide . sodium dodecyl sulfate  does bind cyp <dig> and causes a type i spectral shift. although no binding constant was determined, it was observed that the maximal shift to  <dig> nm occurred below  <dig>  mm and reverted back to  <dig> nm above this concentration, a phenomenon likely to be linked to the critical micelle concentration for sds .

alkane effects on morphology and localization of cyp110
given the toxicity of hexane to anabaena  <dig>  transmission electron microscopy was used to document changes in cell structure associated with the alkane treatments shown to induce the cyp <dig> expression. vegetative cells from control, dodecane and hexadecane treated cultures are shown in fig. 5a,5b and 5c respectively. many dark spherical inclusions are seen in the dodecane-treated cells . the dodecane treatment also distorts and thickens the cellular and photosynthetic membranes, creating a ruffled effect in both outer and inner membranes. hexadecane treatment did not have the same dramatic effect on membrane morphology, however the close stacking of photosynthetic membranes seen in the control micrograph  is lost with hexadecane treatment .

gold-conjugated anti-cyp <dig> antibodies were used to determine the relative protein expression levels in vegetative cells with and without alkane treatment and to assess vegetative cell versus heterocysts expression patterns anabaena  <dig>  immunoelectron micrographs showed a greater number of anti-cyp <dig> polyclonal gold conjugates in dodecane and hexadecane vegetative cells  than in control samples . expression levels were quantified by counting gold particles in multiple micrographs as shown in table  <dig>  immunogold particles most often clustered around dark-staining material in anabaena  <dig> vegetative cells grown in the presence of  <dig> %  dodecane or hexadecane . we found fewer immunogold particles/cluster in dodecane-treated samples  than hexadecane treated samples . heterocysts showed significantly fewer gold particles than vegetative cells, and the number of gold particles in heterocysts did not increase with hexadecane treatment .

nonspecific immuno-staining was estimated by incubating sections with preimmune rabbit igg or with polyclonal anti-cyp <dig> antibodies that had been pre-adsorbed with purified cyp <dig> protein produced in e. coli. very low background was seen in both the preimmune rabbit igg primary incubation , and sections treated with preabsorbed anti-cyp <dig> antibodies . no clusters of immunogold conjugates were seen in any of the control sections. these results clearly show the majority of cyp <dig> protein is localized in vegetative cells and corroborate northern and western data showing elevated cyp <dig> expression in hexadecane-treated cultures.

discussion
most well characterized microbial p450s enzymes were isolated from heterotrophic organisms and are involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotic compounds for energy and growth. examples include camphor-degrading p450cam  <cit>  and two herbicide inducible p <dig> genes in streptomyces griseolus  <cit> . there is no evidence to date for cytochrome p450-dependent oxidative metabolism in the cyanobacteria. a p450-dependent n-demethylation activity is known in unicellular green algae that activates the pro-herbicide metflurazon into norflurazon  <cit> . two genera of marine cyanobacteria microcoleus and phormidium were isolated from oil spills along the arabian sea and reported to contribute to oil degradation  <cit> . while the first step in alkane degradation in many microbial systems is a p450-dependent hydroxylation  <cit> , there are no data on the mode of alkane metabolism nor confirmation of hydrocarbon oxidation by axenic isolates of these cyanobacterial strains. recent evidence does show that mixtures of these cyanobacteria and organotrophic bacteria of the genera rhodococcus, arthrobacter, pseudomonas, and bacillus are more effective than either group alone towards alkane oxidation in inorganic growth media  <cit> .

the available evidence suggests that cyp <dig> does not participate in the degradation of alkanes. cyp <dig> has low overall sequence similarity to other known alkane hydroxylase enzymes like the cyp <dig> family  <cit> . alkanes are quite toxic to anabaena  <dig>  and purified cyp <dig> protein expressed in e. coli binds fatty acids but not alkanes using a spin-shift assay. the membrane localization and spin-shift binding data suggest that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are the most likely endogenous substrates for cyp <dig>  the endogenous function of cyp <dig> in anabaena  <dig> remains a mystery. sequence comparisons indicate the protein is related to the fatty acid omega hydroxylase proteins. one possibility is that Ï‰-hydroxylated fatty acids are further oxidized to dicarboxylic acids which then undergo Î²-oxidation from both ends yielding acetate, as demonstrated in eukaryotic peroxisomes  <cit> .

cytochrome p <dig> proteins in diazotrophic bacteria have been suggested to play an ancillary role in nitrogen fixation. many years ago, appleby proposed that a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme functions as an alternative high-affinity oxidase in an efficient, leghemoglobin-facilitated pathway of oxidative phosphorylation in bacteroids of bradyrhizobium japonicum  <cit> . the idea was based on spectroscopic evidence for the presence of a p <dig> protein in b. japonicum bacteroids but not in aerobically grown cells and the blocking of the high-affinity oxidase system by the p <dig> inhibitor, n-phenylimidazole. more recently both bacteroids and anaerobically grown b. japonicum cells were shown to contain two immunologically distinct cytochromes p <dig>  which were cloned and designated cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  <cit> . neither protein is expressed in aerobically grown b. japonicum cells, consistent with the appleby hypothesis. transposon mutagenesis of the cyp <dig> locus was found to block expression of both cyp <dig> and cyp <dig>  nevertheless, the mutant strain produced effective nodules on soybeans. these results show neither protein is essential for symbiotic function under the conditions of plant growth used in these experiments. subsequent analysis of the b. japonicum p <dig> cluster identified a third p <dig> gene and other open reading frames suggesting an operon involved in terpenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . like the anabaena  <dig> strain missing the nifd element, a quantitative phenotype related to nitrogen fixation under specific culture conditions cannot be excluded from the available evidence. b. japonicum and anabaena  <dig> are not the only diazotrophic bacteria harboring cytochrome p <dig> genes near clusters of nitrogen fixation-related genes. the large sym plasmid from rhizobium sp. ngr <dig> confers the ability to associate symbiotically with plants. it contains two cytochrome p <dig> genes whose function are not known  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
alkanes have been hypothesized to act as universal inducers of microbial p <dig> genes  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a small but reproducible 2-fold enhancement of cyp <dig> transcription induced by  <dig> % hexadecane. we did not test lower concentrations of hexane or dodecane to determine if non-toxic concentrations would have p450-inducing activity in anabaena  <dig>  we cannot rule out the possibility that the lower solubility of longer chain alkanes in aqueous solutions may have been more important for the activity of hexadecane as an inducer than chain-length per se. the cyp <dig> protein displayed the highest affinity towards long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and was localized primarily in photosynthetic vegetative cells of anabaena  <dig>  unlike most prokaryotic p <dig> proteins, cyp <dig> was found to be associated with membrane fractions consistent with the solubility characteristics of its preferred substrates.
