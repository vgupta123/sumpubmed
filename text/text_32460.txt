BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective demise of upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord  <cit> . disease onset occurs in mid-life  and is followed by a rapid , progressive failure of the neuromuscular system and death. although the aetiology of als is yet to be fully elucidated, several factors are likely to contribute to motor neuron injury, including excitotoxic and oxidative motor neuron damage, protein aggregation, impaired axonal transport, mitochondrial dysfunction, and non-cell autonomous damage mediated through glial cells - astrocytes and microglia  <cit> . most of the current insights into disease pathogenesis come from studies on animal models overexpressing mutant forms of cu/zn superoxide dismutase  <dig>   <cit> . autosomal dominant inheritance of mutant sod <dig> accounts for  <dig> percent of familial als  cases, or  <dig> percent of all als cases  <cit> . overexpression of mutant forms of sod <dig>  including g93a, g37r and g85r mutant sod <dig>  in animal models faithfully replicates pathological features of the human disease  <cit> . motor neurons expressing mutant sod <dig> can escape disease if surrounded by a sufficient number of normal non-neuronal cells  <cit> . conversely, normal motor neurons surrounded by mutant sod1-containing non-neuronal cells developed signs of cellular injury with the development of ubiquitinated protein deposits  <cit> . selectively reducing the levels of mutant sod <dig> in motor neurons delayed early disease progression and extended lifespan by a mean of  <dig> percent . in contrast, reducing mutant sod <dig> expression in microglia, the major immune cell of the cns with a monocyte/macrophage phenotype, had no effect on onset and early disease but showed a large protective effect in late stage disease and ameliorated disease progression with a mean extension of survival of  <dig> days  <cit> . moreover, a significant slowing of disease progression was observed in double transgenic g93a-sod1/pu.1-/- mice when the mice received wild type but not g93a-sod <dig> bone marrow transplant  <cit> .

while the mechanisms of microglial disease propagation remain to be fully elucidated, studies indicate that mutant sod1-overexpressing microglia may acquire an exaggerated inflammatory phenotype and neurotoxic properties following sustained activation. low levels of inflammatory mediators are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of als patients  <cit>  and activated microglia are detected in the cns  <cit>  and in the neighbourhood of degenerating motor neurons in post-mortem studies of the human disease  <cit> . sod <dig> transgenic mouse and rat models of als also display signs of an inflammatory response in the cns at all stages of the disease. prior to the clinical signs of disease onset, microglia are in an early state of activation, and elevated levels of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin - <dig> can be detected  <cit> . with the onset of symptoms and motor neuron cell death, fully activated  microglia are present in the cns and microglial production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor -α has been demonstrated  <cit> . elevated levels of tnf-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein - <dig>  macrophage-colony stimulating factor , interferon -γ and transforming growth factor -β  <cit>  and an increase in cyclooxygenase - <dig> activity and prostaglandin  e <dig> levels  <cit>  have been shown in mutant sod <dig> transgenic mouse tissues and microglial cells. administration of drugs such as minocycline, or inhibitors of cox- <dig> and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , capable of reducing microglial activation, delayed both disease onset and progression in mutant sod <dig> transgenic mice  <cit> .

it is unknown whether microglia overexpressing the wild type form of human sod <dig> can acquire altered functional properties. overexpression of wild type sod <dig> in animals did not reveal any overt pathology at four months of age  <cit>  except signs of deficiency of muscle innervation and premature aging  <cit> . thus, wild type sod <dig> could also contribute to neuronal pathogenesis. for example, autopsy material from familial as well as sporadic als cases revealed lewy body-like hyaline inclusions within motor neurons that immunoreacted with anti-sod <dig> antibodies  <cit> . overexpression of wild type sod <dig> in mutant sod <dig> transgenic animals accelerated the disease course and shortened the lifespan of double transgenic animals  <cit> . additionally, wild type sod <dig> acquired toxic properties similar to those of the mutant forms of sod <dig> following oxidative damage  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that wild type sod1-overexpressing microglia may also have altered cellular properties rendering the cells capable of propagating neuronal damage.

in healthy animals, microglia perform a surveillance function to maintain a physiologically healthy microenvironment  <cit> . they accomplish this by sampling the surrounding tissue with numerous extruding and retracting processes  <cit> . alterations in the tissue microenvironment induce microglial migration to the site of damage, scavenging of extruded cellular or plasma proteins and clearance of damaged cell components through phagocytosis  <cit> . these dynamic effector functions of microglia are dependent on the presence of diverse surface receptors, including cytokine, chemokine, immunoglobulin, and purinergic receptors  <cit> . efficient intracellular signalling, control of gene expression, and tightly regulated function of the actin cytoskeleton are also necessary for appropriate microglial effector responses  <cit> . interestingly, in vivo recordings of labelled microglia from sod <dig> g93a-overexpressing mice revealed significantly increased microglial response towards laser-induced single axon transection at preclinical age  when compared to that in control mice, and a subsequent reduction in sod <dig> g93a microglial response to the same injury with disease progression   <cit> .

the purpose of the current study was to investigate whether overexpression of the mutant sod <dig> transgene  or the wild type sod <dig> transgene  in microglia could significantly alter their functional properties, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration and its propagation. due to inherent differences between the two colonies of transgenic mice that we observed in our studies, we compared the differences between ntg and tg cells within colonies, and not between colonies. specifically, we examined non-transgenic  and ntg ) and sod1-overexpressing transgenic  microglial surface expression of integrin β- <dig> , the ability of microglia to spread on fibronectin-coated surfaces and to migrate over astrocytic monolayers, the ability to phagocytose apoptotic neuronal cell debris, and intracellular calcium changes in response to a pro-inflammatory stimulus, extracellular atp. mutant sod <dig> caused the most marked changes in these functions but overexpression of wild type sod <dig> also produced significant changes. thus, it is essential to examine the effects of both mutant and wild-type sod <dig> when investigating the role of microglial cells in als.

RESULTS
reduced expression of integrin β- <dig> by tg g93a microglia
microglia were purified from mixed glial cultures of tg wt, ntg , tg g93a and ntg  mice. figure  <dig> presents immunostaining images of microglia in mixed glial cultures and following purification. mixed glial cultures contained astrocytes and microglia  but purification using a mild trypsinisation method resulted in cultures consistent of cells positive for the monocyte/macrophage marker f4/ <dig> - microglia . to investigate if overexpression of sod <dig> in microglia could alter their interaction with the extracellular matrix, cell surface expression of integrin β- <dig>  was measured in tg g93a and tg wt microglia and compared to those in respective ntg cells. while tg wt microglia had integrin β- <dig> levels comparable to those in ntg  cells :  <dig>  ±  <dig> % on tg wt versus  <dig> ±  <dig> % on ntg  cells; figure 1f), the expression of integrin β- <dig> on tg g93a microglia was modestly but significantly reduced when compared to ntg  cells  cells; p =  <dig> , student's t test, figure 1f). additional file  <dig> presents the data of figure 1f in more detail.

reduced spreading ability of tg g93a microglia
to investigate whether the reduced expression levels of integrin β- <dig> by tg g93a microglia could impair interactions of tg g93a microglia with the extracellular matrix, the spreading of microglial cells on a fibronectin-coated surface was examined. figure  <dig> shows representative images captured for a spreading microglial cell , and the same images modified for cell surface area calculations . individual microglia were analysed for the time taken to initiate spreading after attaching to the fibronectin-coated surface, and the subsequent speed of spreading, if initiation was successful. the spreading profiles of tg wt and ntg  microglia were similar, and consisted of comparable percentages of cells that spread immediately, after a delay of  <dig> s before initiating spreading, or that were stationary, i.e. that failed to spread  cells; delayed:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in tg wt versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in ntg  cells; stationary:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in tg wt versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in ntg  cells, figure 2c). in contrast, the spreading profiles of tg g93a and ntg  microglia differed significantly. tg g93a microglia had a lower percentage of immediate and a higher percentage of stationary cells when compared to ntg  microglia  cells; p =  <dig> , student's t test; delayed:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in tg g93a versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in ntg  cells; stationary:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in tg g93a versus  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in ntg  cells; p =  <dig> , student's t test, figure 2d).

spreading and migration speeds are unaltered in tg g93a microglia but are increased in tg wt cells
to further investigate if the reduced expression levels of integrin β- <dig> by tg g93a microglia affected microglial spreading and migration, the speeds of spreading and migration were measured. while the ability to spread on fibronectin-coated surface was impaired in the tg g93a microglia , the speed of spreading of those tg g93a microglia that did spread was not different from that of spreading ntg  microglia  microglia, figure 3a). interestingly, tg wt microglia that did spread had a greater speed of spreading compared to ntg , albeit not statistically significant  microglia; p =  <dig> , student's t test, figure 3a). to investigate if the spreading impairment of tg g93a microglia could affect migration, the speed of random migration of ntg , tg g93a, ntg  and tg wt microglia on genotype-matched astrocytic monolayers was measured. tg g93a microglia had similar speed of migration as ntg  microglia  microglia). again, tg wt cells showed increased speed of migration when compared to ntg  microglia  cells, p =  <dig> , student's t test, figure 3b). directional migration of ntg , tg g93a, ntg  and tg wt microglia towards the chemoattractant mcp- <dig> was also investigated , without detectable differences in distance migrated between the cells of the four genotypes .

reduced ability of tg wt and tg g93a microglia to phagocytose apoptotic neuronal cell debris
to establish if the overexpression of sod <dig> in microglia altered the ability to phagocytose apoptotic cell debris, the phagocytosis of apoptotic murine neuronal cell  debris by microglia was investigated. microglial cells, incubated with apoptotic nsc <dig> neuronal cell debris, labelled with a membrane dye vybrantdii, were extensively washed to remove any unphagocytosed material and immunostained with anti-integrin β- <dig> antibody to delineate the plasma membrane. figure  <dig> presents the scoring scale used to score the level of phagocytosis  and representative immunostaining pictures of ntg  and tg g93a microglia with the phagocytosed material . the percentage of microglia with medium  to high  loads of phagocytic material were compared between the four genotypes. tg g93a and tg wt microglia had a significantly lower percentage of microglia scoring from  <dig> to  <dig> than the respective ntg cells  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for ntg  microglia, p =  <dig> , student's t test, figure 4c).

reduced intracellular calcium release in tg wt and tg g93a microglia following extracellular atp stimulation
to investigate whether the overexpression of sod <dig> in microglia affected intracellular calcium changes following a pro-inflammatory stimulus, microglial intracellular calcium concentration  was measured before, during, and after stimulation with  <dig> μm atp. stimulation with atp increased i and withdrawal of atp resulted in a steady reduction of the i to almost baseline levels in microglia of all genotypes . microglia of all four genotypes had comparable baseline i:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for ntg ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for tg g93a,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for ntg  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for tg wt. the first  <dig> s of atp stimulation resulted in an initial rapid increase of i in ntg microglia, followed by a steady reduction of i during the remaining  <dig> s of atp challenge. however, tg microglia displayed a different pattern of i changes; the initial peak in i was absent in both tg g93a and tg wt microglia . the first  <dig> s of atp challenge only moderately increased the i in tg g93a and tg wt microglia. this i was maintained until atp was withdrawn. the area-under-the-curve  calculations quantified this pattern of i changes, and showed areas of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm*s for ntg  versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm*s for tg g93a microglia, p =  <dig> , student's t test, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm*s for ntg  versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm*s for tg wt cells, not significantly different . the highest value of i was significantly smaller in tg g93a and tg wt microglia when compared to respective ntg cells and was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for tg g93a versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for ntg  cells, p =  <dig> , student's t test, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for tg wt versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm for ntg  microglia, p =  <dig> , student's t test . interestingly, stimulation of microglia with a high concentration of atp  reversed this initial reduced response in i changes, but only in tg g93a microglia .

discussion
in the present study we compared an array of functional properties of transgenic microglia overexpressing wild type sod <dig> or mutant sod <dig> g93a to those of non-transgenic control cells.

integrin β- <dig>  is involved in diverse cellular functions including cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix, focal adhesion, migration, actin polymerisation/assembly, and regulation of the cell cycle  <cit> . we observed only modestly reduced levels of integrin β- <dig> on tg g93a microglia when compared to the levels on ntg  cells. also, the small sample size of tg wt and ntg  microglia may have prevented the detection of differences in integrin β- <dig> expression levels in this cell population. nonetheless, reduced levels of integrin β- <dig> on tg g93a microglia could lead to impaired adhesion, migration, phagocytosis, and proliferation. to test whether the former three functions were altered in tg g93a microglia, we examined microglial spreading on fibronectin-coated surface, migration on genotype-matched astrocytic monolayers, and phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cell debris. we observed that although expression of integrin β- <dig> was marginally reduced, and spreading ability impaired, in tg g93a cells, these changes did not affect the migration of tg g93a microglia, as the cells were capable of migrating on genotype-matched astrocytes at the same speed as ntg  cells. this observation may indicate that the slightly reduced levels of integrin β- <dig> expression on tg g93a microglia may have no significant impact on the cellular spreading and migration, or that additional receptor-ligand interactions compensate for reduced integrin β- <dig> expression and impaired spreading ability.

our study also showed that overexpression of both transgenes affected microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cell debris, an effect presumably unrelated to the reduced integrin β- <dig> expression. microglial uptake of degenerating motor neuronal debris has been shown in vivo after injection of toxin ricin into rat facial nerve  <cit> . microglia were the primary cells to clear neuronal debris from degenerating neurons during development or after neuronal injury in adult animals  <cit> . efficient clearance of sod <dig> aggregates significantly improved the disease course in als model mice  <cit> . moreover, persistence of destroyed tissue debris was capable of inducing and perpetuating cns tissue inflammation  <cit> . thus, the impaired ability to phagocytose apoptotic neuronal debris by tg wt, and more so by tg g93a, microglia may contribute to disease exacerbation.

overexpression of sod <dig> g93a as well as wild type sod <dig> altered the intracellular ca2+ responses to extracellular atp stimulation. cellular responses to extracellular nucleotides are mediated via cell surface p <dig> purinoreceptors, now classified as metabotropic  receptors that mediate signalling through g-proteins, and ionotropic  receptors that are directly coupled to non-selective cationic receptors allowing for influx of ca2+ and na+ and efflux of k+  <cit> . physiologically, atp-induced signalling attracts microglia to the site of injury or cellular damage resulting in microglial activation  <cit> . microglia express p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors  <cit> , and their stimulation initiates release of ca2+ from intracellular stores. in addition, stimulation through p2x receptors induces non-selective ion exchange that may result is microglial depolarisation  <cit> . microglia from sod <dig> g93a-overexpressing als mouse models were found to have an increased expression of p2x <dig>  p2x <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors and reduced ability to hydrolyse extracellular atp  <cit> . moreover, prolonged  stimulation with  <dig> μm atp induced higher levels of cox- <dig> expression and elevated production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α in sod <dig> g93a microglia compared to ntg cells  <cit> , demonstrating the exaggerated pro-inflammatory phenotype of sod <dig> g93a microglia. however, during our experiments, short  stimulation of microglia with  <dig> μm atp demonstrated that microglia overexpressing sod <dig> g93a, or wild type sod <dig>  had a reduced initial increase in intracellular ca2+ when compared to that in ntg cells, which suggests an alteration of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. thus, higher atp levels, and/or prolonged stimulation by the nucleotide, may be necessary in order to elicit physiologically relevant responses from sod1-overexpressing microglia, although overstimulation leads to exaggerated pro-inflammatory response from tg g93a microglia .

to summarise, it is well characterized that in als animal models activated microglia contribute to neurodegeneration through production of neurotoxic compounds following activation  <cit>  and acquisition of an exaggerated inflammatory phenotype  <cit> . here, we show evidence that sod <dig> transgenic microglia have a reduced capacity to sense tissue disturbances under resting conditions. the affected functions in resting sod <dig> microglia are a reduced ability to phagocytose apoptotic neuronal cell debris and an attenuated response to extracellular atp stimulation. we propose that resting state microglia overexpressing sod <dig> g93a, or wild type sod <dig>  may contribute to disease pathogenesis through loss of efficient tissue-protective functions. also, caution must be used when ascribing alterations in microglial behaviour to mutant sod <dig> expression. our results indicate that wild-type sod <dig> overexpression can alter some properties of microglia and should be an obligatory control in all experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
microglia, the macrophages of the brain, are known to play vital physiological roles in maintaining healthy cns tissue architecture and function. in als pathogenesis, microglia contribute to disease progression through continuous activation and secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic mediators. here, we present the novel findings that resting-state microglia overexpressing wild type or mutant sod <dig> transgenes have reduced physiologic responses of apoptotic neuronal cell clearance and release of ca2+ from intracellular stores upon atp stimulation. our findings indicate that transgenic sod <dig> microglia may require higher concentrations of stimulatory factors to elicit physiologically-relevant functions, indicating reduced neuroprotective behaviour of tg microglia.
