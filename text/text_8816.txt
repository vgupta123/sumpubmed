BACKGROUND
protamines are small basic proteins which condense the dna in mature spermatozoa  <cit> . the extremely compact nature of the nucleoprotamine complex and the inherent problems in the crystallographic approach have made it difficult to study the structure of dna-bound protamine; as a result, several structural aspects of nucleoprotamine remain unsettled. typical protamines are of simple composition and very arginine-rich, usually in the range 60-80%. they are characterized by a number of stretches of arginine residues separated by neutral amino acids. fibre-diffraction diagrams from reconstituted nucleoprotamine and whole sperm cells indicate that dna molecules are tightly packed in a hexagonal unit cell and that dna is in a b-like structure, with ten base-pairs per helical turn  <cit> . the structural features of dna-bound protamine are more difficult to establish because the protein, in contrast to dna, is not sufficiently ordered to be visible in fibre diffraction diagrams.

there are two main types of model for the conformation of dna-bound protamine: a) those that assume that the protamine follows the path of either the narrow or the wide groove of the dna, with the guanidinium groups of consecutive arginines binding alternatively to the phosphate groups of either strand of the dna double helix  <cit> . in this models, the stretches of arginine lack intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and, therefore, of secondary structure of its own. this model is supported basically by model building studies. b) other models assume that the stretches of arginine adopt an α-helical structure when bound to dna. this model is supported mainly by the results of warrant and kim  <cit>  showing that salmine  adopts, at least in part, an α-helical conformation when diffused inside a preformed t-rna crystal. a different kind of helical structure, the γ-ribbon, stabilized by 1→ <dig> hydrogen bonding, has also been suggested for the dna-bound protamine  <cit> .

we have studied for the first time the secondary structure of salmine and squid protamine inside sperm nuclei by ftir . this technique is particularly well suited to the study of dna-bound protamine in whole nuclei since it is not affected by turbidity. in sperm nuclei, the dna-bound protamine appeared to be structured by intramolecular hydrogen bonding to a large extent. the α-helix was present in both protamines, but it was more abundant in squid protamine than in salmine . other components were assigned to β-turns and to structures not stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

RESULTS
structure predictions
salmine is a typical fish protamine of  <dig> amino acids, with 67% arginine. squid protamine has two very similar components, sp <dig> and sp <dig>  <cit> . sp <dig> is the most abundant , with  <dig> amino acids and 79% arginine. squid protamines contain  <dig>  or  <dig>  tyrosines. the amino acid sequences are shown in figure  <dig> 

secondary structure predictions for salmine and squid protamine were performed using several methods based on different principles . these methods were capable of predicting the presence of α-helix in both protamines. the consensus prediction for salmine contained 19% α-helix, while squid protamine  showed a much higher helical propensity with 57% α-helix. previously, the presence of α-helix in clupeine z, a fish protamine, similar to salmine, was predicted with a modified version of the chou and fasman program  <cit> .

circular dichroism
we studied the secondary structure of salmine and squid protamine by cd in the presence of trifluoroethanol , a widely used secondary structure stabilizer. both protamines had little structure in dilute solution and physiological salt . addition of tfe increased the α-helical content, as shown by the increase of negative ellipticity at  <dig> nm and the change in the shape of the spectrum. the helical content of the protamines in function of tfe concentration was estimated by the method of chen et al.  <cit>  . in 90% tfe, salmine and squid protamine contained 34% and 65% α-helix, respectively. the absence of an isodichroic point in the spectra obtained in increasing tfe concentrations suggests the presence of regions of different helical propensity in both protamines. in 100% chloroethanol, a 51% of α-helix was reported for clupeine z  <cit> .

infrared spectroscopy of sperm nuclei
we studied the structure of dna-bound salmine and squid protamine in purified sperm nuclei by infrared  spectroscopy. the nuclei of mature sperm cells containing typical protamines, as salmine and squid protamine, do not appear to contain other protein components  <cit> . to confirm the absence of non-protamine proteins in nuclei in amounts that could compromise the attribution of the ir signal to protamine, total nuclear extracts were obtained and analyzed as described in methods. combined sds and urea/acetic acid gel electrophoresis showed that protamine was practically the only protein component of nuclei .

nuclei were analyzed immediately after purification and sample drying was avoided. the number and position of the amide i'  band components were obtained by fourier deconvolution and used for the curve fitting of the original envelope by an iterative process previously described  <cit> . measurements were performed at concentration expressed as dna concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml  and  <dig> mg/ml with virtually identical results indicating lack of concentration dependence of the spectra .

in sperm nuclei and physiological salt , salmine had a component band representing 20% of the total amide i' intensity at  <dig> cm- <dig>  which is the canonical position of the α-helix. two other component bands at  <dig> cm- <dig>  and  <dig> cm- <dig>  were assigned to β-turns. the main amide i' component of salmine was at  <dig> cm- <dig>  with 42% of the total intensity . vibrations in this region are usually assigned to random coil/flexible regions, lacking stable patterns of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. a component at about  <dig> cm- <dig> was already observed in early studies of nucleoprotamine films  <cit> . the extended conformations imposed by the dna template, assumed by some models, lack intramolecular hydrogen bonding and would be compatible with the component band at  <dig> cm- <dig>  but considering that the percentage of this component is lower than the percentage of arginine, at least part of the arginine residues should be present as α-helix or β-turns.

the concentration of nuclei expressed as dna concentration was  <dig> mg/ml. band position  and percentage area  and assignment of the components were obtained after curve fitting of the amide i band . the buffer was  <dig> mm hepes plus  <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl, ph <dig> . the values were rounded off to the nearest integer.

deconvolution of the amide i' of squid protamine in sperm nuclei gave the same components observed in salmine. the β-turn components had similar proportions to those in salmine: 17% at  <dig> cm- <dig> and 20% at  <dig> cm- <dig>  in contrast, the α-helix was dominant, with 40% of the total intensity, while the component of random coil/flexible regions decreased to 23%. β-sheet components were not observed neither in salmine nor in squid protamine .

squid sperm nuclei were examined in both  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nacl, the latter corresponding to the salt concentration of sea water, with virtually identical results .

the spectra of both protamines in sperm nuclei showed a large band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponding to the absorption of the side chains of arginine residues in d2o. the band was larger in squid protamine than in salmine, due to the higher content of arginine in squid protamine, but also to the contribution of the absorption at  <dig> cm- <dig> of the tyrosine side chains present in squid protamine  <cit>  .

discussion
protamines have little structure in dilute solution and physiological salt, but acquire different proportions of helical structure in the presence of tfe, a solvent that reveals the conformational propensities of polypeptides . structure predictions using different programs based on different principles also indicate that protamines may have helical potential . these observations, although suggesting that protamines may have its own secondary structure when bound to dna, do not give information on the representation of the different secondary structure motifs present in sperm nuclei. with the purpose of clarifying the issue, we examined purified sperm nuclei by ir spectroscopy.

the ir spectra of both dna-bound protamines could be deconvoluted in terms of three secondary structure motifs: turns, α-helix and unordered structure. no intra or intermolecular β-sheet components were observed. salmine contained 20% α-helix at the canonical position of  <dig> cm- <dig> and 38% β-turns . the remaining 42% vibrated at  <dig> cm- <dig> . this frequency is usually assigned  to the unperturbed amide group interacting with solvent; i.e., not involved in intrachain or interchain hydrogen bonding, and is referred to as random coil/flexible regions. in salmine, the joint contributions of the secondary structure motifs stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding  thus amounted to ~60% of the sequence, while the remaining ~40% appeared as unstructured. squid protamine was more extensively structured, the component band of random coil/flexible regions at  <dig> cm- <dig> representing only 23% of the total intensity. the α-helix was the major component with 40% of the total intensity. β-turns were the other main component with 37%, a percentage similar to that observed in salmine .

examination of the amino acid sequences shows that arginine tracks are shorter in salmine than in squid protamine . this fact, together with the higher proline content of salmine  compared to squid protamine  may explain the higher content of α-helix in squid protamine than in salmine. with ~20% α-helix and  <dig> residues, salmine may have a single helical element, as indicated by structure predictions, while squid protamine with ~40% α-helix and  <dig> residues could contain two or more helical elements.

models of nucleoprotamine have in common the hexagonal packing of the dna molecules, but differ in the conformation and location of the protamine in the complex. in one model, the protamine winds around the minor groove of the dna double helix with the side-chains of the arginine residues neutralizing the phosphate groups of dna  <cit> . similar models locate the arginine tracks in the dna major groove on account of steric considerations  <cit> , with the neutral amino acids protruding into the minor groove of neighbouring dna molecules  <cit> . a main feature of such models is the absence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving the amide groups of the protein backbone.

other models consider the structure of the dna-bound protamine as composed of helical segments corresponding to the tracks of consecutive arginines connected by neutral amino acids. in some models the helical segments wrap around the dna major groove  <cit> , while in others they fill the space between the hexagonally packed dna molecules  <cit> . these later models elaborate the early proposal of luzzati and nicolaiev  <cit> , where protamine, in a non-specified conformation, fills the gaps between hexagonally packed dna molecules.

in general, models for nucleoprotamine assume a uniform secondary structure for the arginine tracks and even for the entire protein. our results show that the secondary structure of protamines in sperm nuclei is heterogeneous, and contains α-helix, β-turns and non-hydrogen bonded conformations. furthermore, comparison of the experimental percentages of secondary structure with the percentages of arginine in salmine and squid protamine indicates that all the arginine residues cannot be in a single conformation, since the percentages of α-helix are lower than those of arginine in both protamines, and the same applies to random coil/flexible regions and β-turns. the results showing large differences in secondary structure between salmine and squid protamine indicate that there is not a unique conformation for protamine in sperm nuclei, in spite of the common hexagonal packing of dna molecules.

CONCLUSIONS
the possibility of deconvoluting the amide i' band in components arising from different secondary structure motifs, together with the insensibility of ir spectroscopy to light scattering artefacts, has allowed to show that in sperm nuclei protamines contain large amounts of defined secondary structure stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. both salmine and squid protamine contain similar amounts of β-turns, but differ in the proportions of α-helix and non-hydrogen bonded structure. it is to be noted that in spite of these conformational differences, both protamines are equally efficient in promoting tight hexagonal packing of the dna molecules  <cit> .
