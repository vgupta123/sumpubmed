BACKGROUND
the conservation of gene order has been found to play an essential role in genome evolution. more specifically, proteins encoded by genes of conserved order in bacteria tend to evolve more slowly when compared to proteins encoded by genes without a conserved order  <cit>  and genes with similar or related functions tend to occur in adjacent chromosomal positions in yeast  <cit> . moreover, genes with conserved order were found to evolve at similar rates  <cit>  and, in prokaryotes, proteins encoded by genes with conserved order appear to interact physically  <cit> . it has also been shown that in eukaryotes essential genes are clustered in regions with low recombination rates  <cit> , whereas in bacteria essential genes are more conserved than non essential genes  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that the number of interactions involved in a protein network is directly correlated with the rate of evolution among these proteins  <cit>  and that highly expressed genes evolve slowly  <cit> . a case in point for the role of gene order in evolution can be illustrated by duplicated genes  <cit> . following a duplication event one of the two  genes might keep its original function, whereas the other one might be under less selective pressure. yet, it is not always readily apparent which duplicated genes evolve faster. there have been reports that have marginally correlated sequence conservation with genome context  <cit> , but there must be other, yet unknown, functional features that determine the fate of duplicate genes.

recently, two research groups observed independently that the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein  plays an important role as a general transcriptional repressor of a large number of genes in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt <dig>   <cit> . h-ns is a protein that is believed to play an essential role in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin as well as in transcriptional regulation for many bacterial genes  <cit> . h-ns binds to these genes and silences them transcriptionally. an apparent common feature of genes silenced by h-ns is that their gc content is significantly lower than the overall gc content of the salmonella genome  <cit> . additionally, a large proportion of these h-ns repressed genes is predicted to have been acquired from a foreign source   <cit> , a fact in agreement with the observation that htgs are relatively at-rich  <cit> . it has been suggested that this may be a defensive mechanism against foreign genetic material without loosing the benefit of future usage of this material if necessary  <cit> .

herein, we aimed to test the correlation between gene order conservation, gene duplication and h-ns dependent silencing in s. typhimurium, using escherichia coli k <dig> as a reference genome in order to identify the conservation or loss of gene order along the bacterial chromosome. we have also attempted to associate the above mentioned features with gc content and gene essentiality.

RESULTS
evolutionary rate and gc content are related to genomic neighborhood conservation
we compared the proteins predicted to be encoded in the completely sequenced genome of s. typhimurium  <cit>  against the proteins encoded in the genome of e. coli k <dig>  <cit> , both obtained from the ncbi genomes division ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/bacteria/ using blastp  <cit> . using the criteria described in materials and methods, we identify  <dig> homologs  between these two highly related bacterial species, of which  <dig> were found to be encoded by genes of conserved order  and  <dig> proteins encoded by genes that have lost their order  . the remaining  <dig> genes either fell below the e-value threshold or exhibited significant similarities only in short segments, when compared to their full length sequences and thus were not considered to have a homolog in e. coli k <dig>  the  <dig> homolog pairs with conserved gene order share an average sequence identity of  <dig> %, whereas the  <dig> proteins that were encoded by genes with no order conservation share an average sequence identity of  <dig> % . the difference between the two groups is statistically significant according to a wilcoxon rank-sum test . subsequent analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the gc content for the three aforementioned classes of salmonella genes , which was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively . taking into account that the gc content of the salmonella genome is  <dig> % it is readily apparent that gco are enriched in gs and cs. this sizable decrease in gc content in the last two groups could be explained either by the presence of a large number of horizontally transferred genes in the last two groups, or by an accumulation of at-rich mutations in genes belonging to these groups.

in order to check the former hypothesis, we cross-checked the three groups for the existence of htgs in the salmonella genome using hgt-db, a database of putative horizontally transferred genes in prokaryotes  <cit> . as expected, the majority of predicted htgs fall into the last two categories , but after removing htgs from the complete gene set, the results were not affected . however, this observation could be biased because the methodological approach used in hgt-db to infer lateral gene transfer events, is largely dependent on gc content  <cit> . the latter hypothesis could be explained by our finding that the last two categories of genes may be under weaker selective pressure than the first one and, consequently, accumulating a larger number of mutations, especially c-to-t mutations which are known to be the most common ones under neutral evolution  <cit> . the observation that genomes of intracellular pathogens tend to be at rich for energetic and resources availability reasons  <cit>  could also explain the aforementioned result. after a speciation event occurs, some genes might remain gco and continue to evolve slowly. this is probably the result of the strong evolutionary pressure to maintain their relative order, assisting the preservation of protein function or interaction with neighboring genes. on the other hand, other genes might lose their relative genomic position and start evolving faster. genes in salmonella with no homologs in e. coli k <dig> could either be htgs or genes that have lost their genomic neighborhood and subsequently evolved to such an extent that no significant sequence similarities could be detected to support homology to any e. coli k <dig> gene.

in order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the selective constraint for the groups of gco and ngco genes we calculated the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous  nucleotide substitutions by projecting the protein sequence alignments to the respective genomic sequences. the mean ka/ks ratio for gco and ngco groups was calculated to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, using the yn <dig> method  <cit>  as implemented in the paml package  <cit>  . this difference is found to be statistically significant and is indicative of a stronger selective constraint under which gco genes are evolving in salmonella.

the fate of duplicated genes is determined by gene order conservation
the most striking evidence that gco genes evolve, on average, significantly slower than the ngco genes, is inferred from an analysis of the subset of duplicated genes. we performed an all-against-all self-comparison of proteins encoded in the salmonella genome and detected all groups of genes that could be assigned as homologs in the salmonella genome that share the same best hit in the e. coli k <dig> genome . we identified  <dig> such genes   <dig> of which are gco  and  <dig> are ngco . when compared to the same figures for the complete salmonella gene set  the enrichment of the duplicate gene set in ngco genes is evident. this enrichment probably takes place because, after a duplication event occurs, the selective pressure on one gene to retain its genomic neighborhood becomes less stringent. the proteins of gco genes in the  <dig> duplicates share a  <dig> % identity , whereas for the  <dig> proteins of ngco genes this figure drops to  <dig> %  . this result leads us to two major conclusions: first, as it may be deduced from a comparison of these identity percentages with the result for the complete genome set, the proteins encoded by this subset of duplicated genes evolve faster . second, whenever a gene duplication event occurs, the gene that retains its gene order tends to evolve more slowly than the one that travels away from the ancestral gene neighborhood and probably it is the former that keeps the original function. this finding complements an earlier study  <cit> , although different experimental approaches have been employed here. our results, even though based on the average conservation of putative homologs, corroborate the finding that genomic neighborhood conservation is an important additional criterion that should be taken into account in protein sequence similarity searches. we reached the same conclusions after calculating the ka/ks ratio for the two different duplicated gene groups - gco and ngco - with respective values  <dig>  and  <dig>  . in most cases where all duplicated genes were ngco, none of the genes exhibited particularly high identity to the common e. coli k <dig> homolog . an analysis of the average gc content for the duplicated genes  showed a similar pattern with the one of the overall genome .

essential genes tend to conserve their order
further examination showed that, of the  <dig> experimentally verified salmonella genes that were found to be essential in a recent study  <cit> ,  <dig> were gco ,  <dig> were ngco  and  <dig> were without an e. coli k <dig> homolog . to support our finding, we generated  <dig> random sets of  <dig> genes  and examined the distributions of genes belonging to the three different classes:  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % respectively, very close to the values for the complete gene set . the  <dig> essential genes with an e. coli k <dig> homolog encode for proteins that exhibit average sequence identity of  <dig> % . these results show that essential genes in bacteria are not only more evolutionary conserved than non essential ones, as was previously shown  <cit> , but they also tend to be gco, at least in salmonella.

h-ns preferentially regulates genes that do not conserve their order
driven by recent results demonstrating that h-ns silences a significant amount of genes thought to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer, we calculated the number of gco and ngco genes in the dataset of  <dig> genes that were found to be silenced by the action of h-ns in the salmonella chromosome  <cit> . we ended up with the following numbers:  <dig> genes were gco ,  <dig>  were ngco and  <dig>  were without any detectable homolog in e. coli k <dig>  the difference in the gene order status of genes compared to the overall genome is striking, with the representation being  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 19% respectively . this result demonstrates a preference of h-ns to repress genes that are either ngco or that have no homologs in closely related species. the  <dig> gco genes shared  <dig> % identity and the ngco  <dig> % , a finding consistent with the results for both the overall genome set and the set of duplicated genes .

we calculated the gc content for the h-ns repressed gco genes , ngco genes  and genes with no detected homolog in e. coli k <dig> , which is a significant decrease of the gc content for all three different groups of genes  . using a list of putative htgs  <cit>  we identified  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> h-ns repressed salmonella genes that were predicted to be horizontally transferred. although there are many genes from the  <dig> which are predicted to be htgs - as previously reported  <cit>  - there is still a large number of h-ns repressed genes that were not predicted to be horizontally transferred. an interesting finding was that in the set of  <dig> h-ns repressed genes  presented a higher gc content compared to the  <dig> h-ns repressed genes predicted to be htgs . someone may argue that these results may be biased due to the method followed in  <cit> . however, we observed a similar pattern of decrease in gc content compared to the one calculated for the complete salmonella gene set .

we illustrate features of the subset of  <dig> hns repressed genes predicted not to be htgs . more specifically, the distribution of hnsnonhgts genes in the three categories depending on gene order conservation largely deviates from the overall genome representation. gco genes are still underrepresented but significantly increased compared to predicted htgs . however, we observe the same characteristic decrease in the average gc content between these gene sets with the overall genome  .

in order to clarify whether the observed differences are due to pathogenicity related genes, we also compared salmonella with an enteropathogenic strain of e. coli    <cit> ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/bacteria/. we identified the complement of genes that had no homolog between salmonella and e. coli k <dig> and had a homolog between salmonella and epec . among the h-ns repressed genes within this dataset , we detected genes of salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig>  such as ssal, s  <cit> , sseb and ssca  <cit> . we also identified salmonella genes whose order switches from ngco to gco when the reference genome is k <dig> and epec, respectively . in this dataset, the h-ns repressed genes  include genes of spi- <dig> such as ssav, n, r, t, u  <cit> .

another interesting observation in the  <dig> h-ns repressed genes was the identification of  <dig> duplicated genes within this dataset  out of which only  <dig> were gco. we subsequently analyzed the gc content for the duplicated genes of which only one paralog is targeted by h-ns. of the  <dig> duplicated genes, a subset of  <dig>  were identified to have  <dig> paralogs which are not h-ns repressed. after comparing the gc content of the above subsets of paralogs, we observed a striking difference. more specifically, the gc content of the  <dig> h-ns repressed genes was  <dig> %  and for their  <dig> paralogs the gc content was  <dig> %  . the above results provide a strong indication that, apart from repressing horizontally transferred genes, h-ns may also play a role in the transcriptional regulation of duplicated genes. interestingly, genes that play an important role in the pathogenicity of salmonella such as ssrb  and ssan, r, t, u and v  were found to be ngco, with low gc content  whereas their corresponding duplicates were gco with significantly higher gc content . moreover, the aforementioned virulence associated genes were identified to be repressed by h-ns  <cit> , whereas their duplicates' expression was not significantly affected by h-ns.

surprisingly,  <dig> genes out of those  <dig> were found to be essential for salmonella. this paradox may be explained either by the growth conditions under which experiments where carried out  <cit>  or by introducing h-ns as a part of a general, yet currently unknown, bacterial regulatory mechanism.

discussion
taken together, this work shows that in salmonella:  the proteins encoded by gco genes tend to be more conserved . probably this is due to a correlation of conservation of gene order and the number of interacting proteins and/or expression levels of proteins encoded by genes belonging to the conserved clusters. although it is known that protein expression levels are correlated to protein evolutionary rates  <cit> , and it is rather controversial whether there is a correlation between the connectivity of nodes in protein interaction networks and evolutionary rate  <cit> , it still remains to be shown if any of these findings correlate to gene order conservation as well.  gco genes have on average higher gc content when compared to genes that are ngco and even higher than genes that do not share any homology to e. coli k <dig> genes . we speculate that this is a result of a mechanism that leads genes which evolve faster than others  to accumulate at-rich mutations.  genes that remain gco have on average significantly lower ka/ks ratio than the ngco ones, indicating that they are under higher selective pressure .  whenever a duplication event takes place, the duplicate that keeps its original order, is the one that keeps the highest sequence similarity  and possibly the original function . on the other hand, when the duplicated gene does not preserve its original order, it is subject to much faster evolution and less selective pressure as it is shown by comparing the respective ka/ks ratios . overrepresentation of ngco genes in the duplicated group demonstrates that selective pressure on genes to keep their order is more relaxed after a duplication event. interestingly, after a duplication event occurs and none of the paralogs retain their ancestral position in the genome, we failed to find any preference for sequence conservation .  finally, we demonstrated that the silencing mechanism via the h-ns protein in salmonella significantly affects genes that are ngco or genes that do not have any  homolog in e. coli k <dig>  this could be another indication that h-ns might play a role, not only as a defensive instrument against foreign acquired dna  <cit>  but also as an internal control of native genes  <cit> , as it could be of benefit to the organism to have them repressed for a variety of reasons associated with genome structure, for duplicated genes, non-essential genes or genes that did not retain their order.

CONCLUSIONS
in our analysis we tried to correlate gene order conservation with gene duplication, gc content and gene silencing in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt <dig> based on two publications concerning h-ns silencing in the aforementioned species. we found that genes of conserved order not only evolve slower, as previously reported, but also tend to have higher gc content than the ones that do not conserve their order. we also found that essential genes tend to retain their genome position. another finding was that after a duplication event takes place the gene that keeps its original position evolves slower than the one that looses it and probably keeps its primary function. our study also shows that h-ns protein, a general repressor of a large number of genes in salmonella, tends to avoid binding on genes with a conserved order. there is a clear indication that from the duplicated genes h-ns "prefers" to repress those ones that do not have a conserved gene order.
