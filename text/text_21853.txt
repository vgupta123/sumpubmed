BACKGROUND
chickpea  is the third most important pulse crop in the world  <cit> . it is often used as a drought-tolerant crop grown in the drier regions of india, east africa, the mediterranean basin, and the americas. in the cereal-based crop rotation systems, chickpea is used as a rotation crop to break disease cycles, fix atmospheric nitrogen and improve soil fertility. it is a major source of high-quality proteins and starch for a large asian vegetarian population and a health-conscious food in developed countries. therefore, understanding its genome is of significance not only economically, but also for annotation, functional and evolutionary analysis of legume genomes, particularly the underlying mechanisms of plant drought tolerance and nitrogen fixation. the most significant constraints to its production are ascochyta blight caused by dydimella rabiei and cultivar adaptation to terminal drought and high temperature during pod set  <cit> . ascochyta blight is a destructive, devastating disease of chickpea and may result in total crop loss  <cit> . hence, combining ascochyta blight resistance with early flowering is crucial to increasing grain yield and quality of chickpea in various rain-fed environments  <cit> . however, it has been proven difficult, without assistance of modern molecular tools, to breed for high grain yield and quality combining both ascochyta blight resistance and early flowering  <cit> .

to facilitate complex trait breeding, and to clone and characterize the genes and loci of agronomic importance in chickpea, some molecular tools have been developed. these include several molecular genetic maps  <cit> , identification of quantitative trait loci  for a number of agronomic traits  <cit> , several large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome  and plant-transformation-competent binary bac  libraries  <cit> , and limited tissue- or treatment-specific expressed sequence tags   <cit> . nevertheless, significant efforts will be needed to make the tools suitable for chickpea breeding. qtl for controlling resistance to didymella rabiei  were mapped to five of its eight chromosomes and qtl for days to first flower  to four chromosomes  <cit> . unfortunately, the markers for most of the qtl are not sufficiently close to the loci for their effective use in marker-assisted selection for the traits.

genome-wide integrative physical mapping has been used in several species to effectively integrate genomic tools for marker-assisted breeding, high-resolution mapping and positional cloning of genes and qtl  <cit> . simultaneously, physical maps will also provide desirable platforms for advanced est analysis, genome sequencing  <cit>  and comparative genomics. despite these advantages, a genome-wide physical map has not been developed for chickpea. lack of such genomic tools and infrastructure for the species has not only limited the deeper analysis of its agronomic genes and qtl, but also prevented genomic information flow to chickpea from the model or related legumes such as medicago, lotus and soybean whose genomes have been sequenced  <cit> . therefore, a comprehensive platform is needed to rapidly access the qtl for rdr, dtf and many other agronomic traits, and advance chickpea and related legume genomics research. in comparison with other major crops such as wheat, maize, soybean, cotton and tomato, chickpea has a relatively smaller genome size . the size of the chickpea genome is comparable to those of the non-cultivated legume models, medicgo  and lotus . the relatively small genome size of chickpea facilitates physical mapping and high-throughput sequencing of its genome, thus facilitating annotation, functional analysis and evolutionary investigation of the legume genomes.

in this study, we constructed one new bac library and one new bibac library from the chickpea cultivar, hadas, using different restriction enzymes and vectors from those used in the existing chickpea libraries. from the two new bac and bibac libraries, and the two bac and bibac libraries of the cultivar previously reported  <cit> , we constructed a genome-wide, bac/bibac-based physical map of the chickpea genome. using the physical map, we identified the bac/bibac contigs containing or closely linked to two qtl, one controlling rdr and the other controlling dtf. these results, especially the genome-wide bac/bibac physical map, will provide a framework for many aspects of genomics and genetics research of the species and finally, for sequencing its genome by using the next-generation high-throughput genome sequencing technology.

RESULTS
new bac and bibac library construction
in a previous study  <cit> , we constructed one bac library  and one bibac library  for chickpea cv. hadas using hind iii and bamh i, respectively . to facilitate quality physical map development of the genome, we constructed one new bac library  and one new bibac library  from the nuclear dna of the same genotype partially digested with mboi and hindiii, respectively . the chickpea-cme bac library contains  <dig>  clones. analysis of  <dig> random clones showed that it has an average insert size of  <dig> kb and provides a  <dig> -fold coverage of the chickpea haploid genome. the chickpea-chv bibac library contains  <dig>  clones. analysis of  <dig> random clones showed that it has an average insert size of  <dig> kb and provides a  <dig> -fold coverage of the chickpea genome . for both libraries, less than 5% of their clones contain no inserts of chickpea dna. we screened  <dig>  clones of the chickpea-chv bibac library using the chloroplast genes, ndha, rbcl and psba, as probes. a total of  <dig> positive clones were obtained, suggesting that approximately  <dig> %  of the new libraries clones were derived from chloroplast dna. this number is close to the chickpea bac and bibac libraries that we constructed previously,  <dig> % of whose clones were derived from chloroplast dna  <cit> . therefore, the two new libraries , along with the two bac  and bibac  libraries  constructed previously  <cit> , provide comprehensive and high-quality source libraries for construction of the chickpea physical map  <cit> .

* the average insert size of fingerprinted clones was estimated to  <dig> kb.

bac/bibac fingerprinting
our previous studies showed that bac and bibac fingerprints generated with different restriction enzyme combinations may result in different quality bac/bibac physical maps  <cit> . therefore, we first tested twenty-four 3-, 4- and 5-enzyme combinations of hind iii, bamh i, ecor i, xba i, xho i, and hae iii using  <dig> bacs randomly selected from the chickpea-chi library. in the combinations, only the ends produced by hind iii, bamh i, ecor i, xba i or xho i digestion are labeled with a fluorescent dye . hae iii is used to further digest the labeled fragments to sizes that allow separation on a capillary sequencer. according to the criteria that there are no partial digestion, no star activity, an average of  <dig> -  <dig> bands per clone and a relatively even size distribution of the bands in a window ranging from  <dig> -  <dig> bases in a single-tube single-step digestion-labeling system, the enzyme combination of hind iii/xba i/xho i/hae iii was selected for generation of bac and bibac fingerprints for the chickpea genome physical mapping.

a total of  <dig>   bac and bibac clones were fingerprinted from the four chickpea bac and bibac libraries , with  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold clones from each library, or  <dig> -fold coverage bacs and  <dig> -fold coverage bibacs. of the clones, the fingerprints of  <dig>   clones were validated and used in the physical map assembly. the validated fingerprints represented approximately  <dig> -fold of the chickpea genome . each clone had an average of  <dig>  restriction fragment bands in the window of  <dig> -  <dig> bases, with a range from  <dig> to  <dig> bands per clone. according to our previous studies  <cit> , the genome coverage of  <dig>  fold should be sufficient to allow the assembly of a high-quality genome-wide physical map of the chickpea genome.

determination of tolerance and cutoff values
the fingerprinted contig  program was used to assemble the contig map from the bac and bibac fingerprints, by which two parameters, tolerance and cutoff, are crucial to quality contig assembly. tolerance is the window size in which two restriction fragments are considered as the same or equivalent bands. to determine the tolerance value to be used for the contig assembly, we selected the four pecbac <dig> vector fragments generated with the enzyme combination  of sizes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases in the range from  <dig> to  <dig> bases released from  <dig> bacs randomly selected from the fingerprint dataset. we calculated the mean size deviation of each of the fragments. at a 95% confidence interval, the mean deviations of the four vector fragments,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases, were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  base, respectively, with an average of  <dig>  bases. therefore, a tolerance value of  <dig>  was chosen as the candidate tolerance value for fpc contig assembly, with all fragment sizes of each fingerprint multiplied by  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the tolerances of  <dig> -  <dig> were tested using the entire fingerprint dataset to determine the parameters suitable for contig assembly. on the basis of these results, a tolerance of  <dig> was finally selected for the contig assembly.

the cutoff value is a threshold of the probability that fingerprint bands match by coincidence. lowering its value would increase contig assembly stringency, and therefore, increase the likelihood that overlapping bac clones are truly overlapping. to determine the cutoff value for the chickpea physical map assembly, we tested a series of cutoff values ranging from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> and a tolerance of  <dig> for automatic contig assembly. the resultant numbers of contigs, singletons, and q -clones were analyzed. at higher stringencies , "chimeric" contigs were split and q-clones were reduced, but the number of singletons increased drastically. at lower stringencies , a smaller number of or larger contigs were obtained, but a larger number of clones were fallen in the category of q-clones. the relationship among the three factors is plotted in figure  <dig>  from which it was apparent that a cutoff value of approximately 1e- <dig> resulted in reasonable low numbers of all three factors, suggesting the desirable quality contig assembly. while the number of qs was  <dig> %  when automatic contigs was initially assembled at the cutoff of 1e- <dig>  it was reduced to  <dig> %  after subsequent dqer at lower cutoff values  that allows re-analysis of the initial assembly step-wisely to reduce the q-clones in the contigs. we, therefore, chose 1e- <dig> as the cutoff value for the initial assembly of the physical map.

contig map assembly
contigs were assembled from the fingerprint data of the clones using the computer program fpc version  <dig>  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  contigs were assembled from the validated  <dig>  bac and bibac fingerprints at a cutoff value of 1e- <dig> and a tolerance of  <dig>  followed by dqer, end-to-end merging and end-to-singleton merging at progressively lower stringencies . the  <dig>  contigs contained a total of  <dig>  clones whereas the remaining  <dig>  clones remained as singletons.

assessment of the contig map and identification of the contigs containing or closely linked to rdr and dtf qtl
several approaches were used to assess the reliability of the chickpea contig map. first, we assembled automatic contigs from the fingerprints using two different contig building strategies and compared the resultant contigs, as described by wu et al.  <cit> . a sample of  <dig> random contigs from the two assemblies was analyzed comparatively. the result showed that  <dig> % of the automated contigs resulted from the two strategies was completely consistent in both clone content and order.

in the second approach, we assembled contigs from the clones of the chickpea-cme and, chickpea-chv libraries, separately. we randomly selected  <dig> contigs from the contigs assembled from each library and compared them with their corresponding contigs in the physical map. we found that 96% and 95% of the contigs were shown to be in complete agreement with the contigs of the chickpea physical map in terms of both clone content and order.

in the third approach, we randomly selected five contigs from the chickpea physical map, fingerprinted their bacs and bibacs with a different enzyme combination, bamhi/hindiii/xhoi/haeiii, and then reassembled them into the contigs. as a result, the same contigs as those selected from the physical map were reassembled.

finally, we verified the accuracy of the contig map by screening the source bibac clones of the chickpea-chv library with ssr primers flanking the rdr and dtf qtl previously mapped to linkage groups lg <dig> and lg <dig>  and to other regions of the chickpea genetic maps  <cit> . if the physical map contigs were assembled properly, the positive clones of a single-copy ssr primer pair should be located to a single bac/bibac contig of the map. we screened two high-density filters of the chickpea-chv library containing a total of  <dig>  double-spotted clones, of which  <dig>  clones were used in the map assembly. a total of  <dig> ssr primer pairs were used as probes for the library screening . of the  <dig> ssr primer pairs, seven, h1g <dig>  h1c <dig>  ta <dig>  h1a <dig>  h1h <dig>  h1c9- <dig> and h2j <dig>  were clearly derived from multiple-copy sequences, as indicated by southern analysis and the library screening result that they hybridized to  <dig> -  <dig> positive clones, respectively. the remaining nine ssr primer pairs were shown to be single- or low-copy by southern analysis, with each hybridizing to  <dig> -  <dig> positive clones, being within the range of expected  <dig>  positive clones per single-copy probe. the positive clones of each of all nine single- or low-copy ssr primer pairs were found to be assembled into a single contig, further suggesting that the physical map contigs are assembled properly. of the nine single- or low-copy marker-containing contigs, contig <dig>  was located to the region of dtf qtl <dig> and spanned a physical length of  <dig>  kb, and contig <dig>  and contig <dig>  were located to the region of rdr qtl <dig>  and spanned a physical length of  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively.

discussion
we have developed a genome-wide, bac/bibac-based physical map of the cultivated chickpea, c. arietinum, from cultivar hadas. the map consists of  <dig>  bac and bibac clones assembled into  <dig>  contigs. each contig contains  <dig> to > <dig> clones with an average of  <dig>  clones per contig, spanning from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb, with an average physical length of  <dig> kb . these contigs collectively span approximately  <dig>  mb, larger than the 740-mb estimated genome size of chickpea by approximately 47%. the longer physical length of the physical map contigs than the estimated genome size may be attributed to one or more of the following factors. overlaps existed between contigs, but they were too small to be detected or merged unambiguously by using the fpc program alone; the average insert size of the source clones was over-estimated; and/or the genome size of chickpea was underestimated. according to previous studies  <cit> , the undetected overlaps among the contigs likely account for much of the discrepancy. as described above, the current physical map has an average overlap of  <dig> %  of clone average insert size , indicating that the clones having an overlap of < <dig> % insert size might be assembled into separate contigs in this study. the existence of overlaps, even though they were undetected by the pfc program under the conditions used in this study, will allow the contigs to be further merged into larger ones. however, further unambiguously merging these contigs will require additional supporting evidence in addition to their fingerprint similarities, such as anchoring of the contigs to the genetic map by mapped dna markers and to the related genome sequences using the end sequences of the source bacs and bibacs as anchors.

the quality of the chickpea physical map is sufficient for its use in different aspects of chickpea genomics research. the clones equivalent to  <dig>  x of the chickpea genome  were assembled into the physical map contigs . according to our previous studies  <cit> , this number of clones is adequate for construction of a high-quality physical map of the chickpea genome, though it is much smaller than those used for the physical maps of human and bovine developed previously  <cit> . moreover, the source clones of the map were randomly selected from four bac and bibac libraries constructed with three restriction enzymes  in three vectors  . although the distribution of the restriction sites of any particular restriction enzyme is uneven throughout a genome, the use of the clones constructed with three different restriction enzymes in three vectors would further increase the actual coverage of the resultant map for the whole genome of chickpea  <cit> . the accuracy of the contig physical map was confirmed using different approaches, including independent contig building methods, different fingerprinting methods and ssr marker hybridization. while the number of the dna makers used in the verification of the physical map contigs was limited, the employment of multiple approaches that were previously proven  <cit>  to the research purpose provided evidence on the reliability of the map assembly. the results of all of the approaches together have verified that the physical map contigs were assembled properly.

the physical map provides a powerful foundation for many aspects of advanced genome research of chickpea and related legume species. using the physical map, we have identified three contigs, ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig>  that likely contain or are closely linked to the rdr qtl <dig>  contributing to  <dig> % of ascochyta blight resistance and the dtf qtl <dig> contributing approximately  <dig> days to earlier flowering . the ctg <dig> spans  <dig> kb, the ctg <dig> spans  <dig>  kb and the ctg <dig> spans  <dig>  kb in physical length. assuming that the average physical/genetic ratio of the chickpea genome is from  <dig> kb/cm  <cit>  to  <dig> kb/cm  <cit> , the ctg <dig> may span approximately  <dig>  -  <dig>  cm, the ctg <dig> may span  <dig>  -  <dig>  cm, and the ctg <dig> may span  <dig>  -  <dig>  cm. since the rdr qtl <dig>  region spans  <dig>  cm and the dtf qtl <dig> region spans within  <dig>  cm  <cit> , these genetic distances may cover the entire regions of the rdr qtl <dig>  and dtf qtl <dig>  respectively. therefore, the contigs have provided powerful tools for fine mapping and cloning of the qtl. furthermore, since the physical map was constructed from both bacs and agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation-ready bibacs, the inclusion of the bibacs will further facilitate cloning and applications of the qtl and other agronomic genes of interest, and promote functional analysis of the chickpea genome by genetic transformation at the whole genome level .

the physical map represents the first generation of the physical map of chickpea. although its utility in isolation of bac/bibac contigs containing or closely linked to qtl has been preliminarily demonstrated in this study, further efforts remain to optimize its effectiveness for whole genome sequencing and sequence assembly, high-density mapping of the genome , and comparative genome analysis with related genome sequences such as those of soybean, medicago and lotus. efforts will be also needed to integrate the contig map with the developed genetic maps of the species and to locate all mapped genes and qtl to the bac/bibac contigs, as was done for rdr qtl <dig>  and dtf qtl <dig> in this study. these include, but are not limited to, sequencing of the source bac and bibac ends, alignment of the bac/bibac contigs along the sequenced soybean, medicago and/or lotus genomes, targeted  development of dna markers and high-density genome maps, and screening of the source bacs and bibacs using mapped dna markers, especially those flanking the genes and qtl mapped . these experiments will not only allow facilitating subsequent sequencing, sequence assembly and sequence annotation of the chickpea and other legume genomes, and deciphering the evolution of the legume genomes as a whole, but also further merging the contigs, thus significantly enhancing the physical map.

CONCLUSIONS
it has been documented that a genome-wide physical map is of significance for advanced genome research. we have developed a genome-wide quality bac/bibac physical map of chickpea and using the map, identified three large contigs containing or closely linked to qtl contributing to ascochyta blight resistance and earlier flowering in chickpea. this map, along further improvements as discussed above, will greatly advance the genomics and genetics research of chickpea and related legumes. the inclusion of plant transformation-ready bibacs in the physical map will further promote its utility in cloning of genes and qtl of interest and functional analysis of the chickpea and related genomes.
