BACKGROUND
gene duplication is one of the major driving forces of evolution . in particular, whole genome duplication  has been thought to be an important factor in the evolution of vertebrates  <cit> . it has been proposed that at least two rounds of wgds occurred during the evolution of vertebrates  <cit>  . recent genome studies of amphioxus  <cit>  and lamprey  <cit> , support this hypothesis. the first-and second-round wgd  are suggested to have occurred in the common ancestor of gnathostomata and cyclostomata  <cit> . thus, almost all modern vertebrates are believed to have undergone wgds at least twice  <cit> . the third-round wgd , in contrast, occurred in the common ancestor of teleosts  . this is represented by the copy number of genes, two in teleosts, one in mammals  <cit> . the hox cluster is the most well-known example in this regard . there are seven hox clusters in teleost genomes, whereas four clusters are present in mammalian, coelacanth, and shark genomes  <cit> . in addition, slightly differentiated expression patterns are observed for teleost hox paralogs derived from 3r . thus, teleost-specific duplicated genes seem to be on a path to functional differentiation, namely, 3r occurred neither too recently nor too early to differentiate the function of paralogs. 3r-derived paralogs could be good examples for evaluating the critical timing of functional differentiation.fig.  <dig> third rounds of wgds during vertebrate evolution. arrowheads on the consensus phylogenetic tree of chordates indicate the timing of 1r, 2r, and 3r. the blue highlighted region indicates the teleost clade. representative chordate species are shown



in the case of gene duplication, it is traditionally expected that one of the duplicated genes becomes free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations in the protein coding and/or cis regulatory regions that led to the loss of its functions  or gain of new functions   <cit> . alternatively, subfunctionalization is observed especially as a result of wgd. in subfunctionalization, both paralogs are functional, but each paralog undergoes a complementary reduction and specialization in its expression pattern because of the mutation of its cis regulatory regions  <cit> . the subfunctionalized paralogs are also expected to gain new function over evolutionary time  <cit> . most of the different expression patterns between teleost-specific paralogs that have been shown by previous studies  could be explained by subfunctionalization. however, in these studies, the different expression patterns were usually discussed based only on in silico studies. in cases where analyses were carried out in vivo, many were performed only at the whole-mount tissue level. very few comparative expression analyses have been carried out at the cellular level, which is indispensable for the investigation of subfunctionalization.

olfactory marker protein  was first isolated from mouse olfactory bulb in the 1970s  <cit> . omp is a small protein  that consists of ~ <dig> amino acids and is specifically expressed in olfactory sensory neurons , which are distributed in the main olfactory epithelium in various vertebrates . although omp is used as a specific marker of mature osns in vertebrates , its function has not yet been fully elucidated. omp-knockout  mice have reduced physiological activity and behavioral responses with respect to sensing odorants as compared with wild-type mice  <cit> . in addition, axons of osns from omp-ko mice project abnormally  <cit> . recent studies have suggested that omp is a critical factor for the functional maturation of osns  <cit>  and is likely to be involved in ca2+ clearance in osns  <cit> . namely, the phenotypes observed in omp-ko mice mentioned above might be caused by a decline in the clearance of ca2+ in these osns.

omp had been believed to be a highly conserved single-copy intronless gene among all vertebrates  <cit> . more recently, it was shown that african clawed frog  and some teleosts have two omps . in african clawed frog, the expression patterns of the two omps are notably, albeit not completely, distinct in the lateral diverticulum and medial diverticulum, in the nasal cavity  <cit> . these expression patterns are suggestive of subfunctionalization. although the expression of each of the two omps was analyzed in medaka   <cit>  and salmon   <cit> , detailed expression patterns were not assessed. in this study, we found with a bioinformatic analysis that teleosts generally possess two omps in their genomes. our phylogenetic analyses revealed that two omps are derived from 3r. until now, expression pattern of omp has been investigated in many vertebrates. accordingly, we expected that detail verification of the expression patterns of omps could be a good example to understand the fate of 3r-derived paralogs. we here shows the detailed expression patterns of two omps at the tissue and the cellular level in zebrafish .

RESULTS
two omps derived from the third-round whole genome duplication in teleosts
to identify omps in teleost genomes, we searched genome databases of zebrafish, stickleback , fugu , medaka, platyfish , and tilapia  by using known omp sequences as queries, and obtained two significant hits from each species . although zebrafish was believed to have a single copy of omp  <cit> , we isolated two omps from the genomes of all teleost, including zebrafish. we named the already-known zebrafish omp as omp <dig> and its paralog as omp <dig>  furthermore, ensembl gene prediction suggested that omp <dig> consists of two exons, although omp is known as an intronless gene  <cit> . we searched omp <dig> sequences from the est database and confirmed that the predictions are consistent with the mrna sequences in zebrafish, stickleback, and medaka. in other teleost species, we estimated the omp <dig> gene structure with genewise. we also searched other vertebrate genome databases and isolated omp orthologs. then, we aligned the amino acid sequences of these omp homologs . amino acids sequences are conserved among teleost omp <dig> and omp <dig> and tetrapod omp. in particular, the eph2b-receptor-like loop domain, a potentially key region for omp function as a molecular switch  <cit> , is highly conserved. thus, the fundamental structure and physiological function of omp <dig> are expected to be similar to those of omp <dig> or tetrapod omp.fig.  <dig> sequence analysis of omp. alignment of amino acid sequences was constructed by clustalw <dig>  colors indicate omp subgroups: blue, teleost omp1; red, teleost omp2; purple, gar omp; black, tetrapod omp. hyphens indicate gaps. light characters indicate conserved amino acids among homologs. vertical dashed line is the junction of omp <dig> exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  secondary structure is based on smith et al.  <cit> . omp has two α-helical regions and eight β-pleated sheets, as shown in the structure below the sequences



based on the genome search, we found that only one omp exists in gar , which diverged from the teleosts before the occurrence of 3r  <cit> . these data suggest that the two omps in teleosts were derived from 3r. to investigate this possibility, we performed phylogenetic analysis that included gar and tetrapods. we constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using amino acids sequences from exon  <dig> of omp <dig> and the homologous regions of omp <dig> and tetrapod omp . teleost omp homologs formed a monophyletic group with a bootstrap value of 99 % that consisted of the omp <dig> clade  and omp <dig> clade . these data strongly suggest that omp was duplicated in a common ancestor of teleosts, after the divergence of gar. thus, we suggest that teleost-specific omp duplication was derived from 3r. it should be noted that each of the salmon omps and xenopus omps formed a monophyletic group, suggesting that duplication of salmon omps and xenopus omps was caused by lineage-specific wgds that occurred independently in those two lineages.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of omp. maximum likelihood phylogeny of omp. colors indicate omp subgroups: blue, teleost omp1; red, teleost omp2; purple, gar omp; black, tetrapod omp. numbers are bootstrap values for each divergence. wedges indicate suggested omp duplication events



we next analyzed the synteny of omp loci  and found that omp is located within the intron of another gene, calpain <dig> . interestingly, teleost capn <dig>  together with omp, was also duplicated. according to the zfin  <cit> , capn5a are encoded on chromosome  <dig> and capn5b are encoded on chromosome  <dig>  consequently, omp <dig> is linked to capn5b and omp <dig> is linked to capn5a. given that both omp <dig> and  <dig> are located within intron <dig> of capn5b and a, respectively, it is highly unlikely that omp duplication was caused by retrotransposition. the genomic structures around omps  are well conserved between paralogs and also among species except for the coding direction of omp. the results of the synteny analysis support our expectation that the two omps are derived from 3r.fig.  <dig> synteny analysis of omp loci. exon map was drawn based on ensembl annotations. boxes indicate exons: those above the line indicate forward strand-coded; those under the lines indicate reverse strand-coded. colors indicate omp or capn <dig> subgroups: blue, teleost omp1; cyan, teleost capn5a; red, teleost omp2; pink, teleost capn5b; purple, gar omp; light purple, gar capn5; black, tetrapod omp; gray, tetrapod capn5




omp <dig> expression in the retina
three typical fates of duplicated genes are known: pseudogenization, neofunctionalization, and subfunctionalization  <cit> . there is another fate of duplicated genes, in which gene duplication simply increases the amount of products as represented by the ribosomal dna genes  <cit> . however, this is an extreme case in that more than hundred copies exist in the genome. accodingly, we focus on the possibilities of neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, which are generally accompanied by differentiated expression patterns that can be assessed by in situ hybridization. we thus examined the expression patterns of omp <dig> and omp <dig> . at first, we investigated the expression of zebrafish omp <dig> and omp <dig> by rt-pcr with total rna extracted from each organ as template . omp <dig> was specifically expressed in the oe, whereas omp <dig> was expressed in the eyes as well as the oe. the expression of omp <dig> in the retina is quite interesting because omp was believed to be specifically expressed in the olfactory organ  <cit> . to examine whether the expression of omp <dig> in the retina is a common phenomenon among other teleost species, we searched the teleost est database and found that the expression of omp <dig> is detected in the eyes or the retina of stickleback and tilapia , showing that omp <dig> is expressed not only in zebrafish eyes but also in the eyes of some other teleosts. we also examined the expression of omp in spotted gar, of which transcriptome data from the eyes is available. interestingly, omp was shown to be apparently expressed in the eyes . next, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization with antisense riboprobe  or sense riboprobe  to omp <dig> to examine expression patterns in detail using cryosectioned eye tissues. surprisingly, omp2-positive signals were detected specifically in the outermost part  of the inner nuclear layer, where retinal horizontal cells are distributed  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of omp <dig> and  <dig> at the tissue level. a rt-pcr analysis of omp <dig>  omp <dig>  and gapdh  in adult zebrafish. dna templates were as follows: b, brain; oe, olfactory epithelium; e, eye; g, gill; s, skin; t, testis; o, ovary; gen, genomic dna. rt–, the cdna synthesis was performed without reverse transcriptase as a negative control for rt-pcr of omp <dig>  note: when genomic dna was used as a tmplates, pcr using omp <dig> or gapdh primers did not amplified fragments because of the presence of introns  in the corresponding sequences in the genomic dna. b expression of omp genes in eyes of gar and zebrafish. bars indicate fpkm ratio of each omp to gαt <dig>  which is coupling with rhodopsins. the number of spotted gar indicate technical replicate. c, d fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for omp <dig> using dig-labeled antisense riboprobes  or sense riboprobes  in transverse sections of adult zebrafish eyes, which were counterstained with dapi. gcl, ganglion cell layer; ipl, inner plexiform layer; inl, inner nuclear layer; opl, outer plexiform layer; onl, outer nuclear layer. arrow indicates omp2-expressing zone. scale bar, 50 μm



divergence of expression patterns between omp <dig> and omp <dig> in the oe
rt-pcr analysis  showed that both omp <dig> and  <dig> are expressed in the oe. to investigate these expression patterns at the cellular level, we performed two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using separately labeled antisense riboprobes . zebrafish omp  was known as a molecular marker for the ciliated osns, and was broadly expressed in the deep layer of the olfactory placode  as sato et al. reported previously  <cit> . in contrast, omp <dig> was sparsely expressed in the superficial layer . merged images show highly exclusive expression of omp <dig> and  <dig> . there were fewer omp2-expressing cells than omp1-expressing cells. these results showed that omp <dig> and  <dig> are mainly expressed in the deep and superficial layer, respectively, and have distinct expression patterns at the cellular level in the oe. in addition, we noticed that a few cells in the superficial layer expressed both omp <dig> and  <dig> . thus, omp <dig> was also expressed infrequently in the superficial layer and the omp1-expressing cells in the superficial layer coexpressed omp <dig>  previously, sato et al.  <cit>  also reported that zebrafish trpc <dig> is a marker for the microvillous osns, and was expressed in the superficial layer of the oe. we therefore examined the expression of omp <dig> and trpc <dig> . as expected, omp <dig> was expressed in the deep layer , whereas trpc <dig> was in the superficial layer . merged images showed that these genes were not coexpressed . we also confirmed that omp <dig> was sparsely expressed in the superficial layer . next, we analyzed the expression of trpc <dig> and omp <dig> . merged images showed that expression of these did not overlap , indicating that omp <dig> was not coexpressed with trpc <dig>  although both genes were expressed in the superficial layer. the distinctive expression of omp <dig> might suggest that omp2-expressing cells are not osns. thus, we examined the expression of ncam, a neural marker, and omp <dig> . merged images showed that omp <dig> was coexpressed with ncam . the results strongly suggest that omp2-expressing cells are actually osns.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of omp <dig> and  <dig> at the cellular level in the oe. two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using dig- or fluorescein-labeled antisense riboprobes in horizontal sections of the adult zebrafish oe. a, d, g fluorescent images of alexa  <dig> derived from dig-labeled riboprobes. b, e, h fluorescent images of alexa  <dig> derived from fluorescein-labeled riboprobes. c, f, i merged images of  and ,  and , and  and , respectively. yellow two-headed arrows and cyan two-headed arrows indicate the superficial layer and the deep layer, respectively. dashed lines indicate the outlines of the epithelium. white arrowheads indicate cells that coexpress omp <dig> and another gene. scale bar, 20 μm



g-protein coexpressed with omp <dig> and omp2
omp <dig> is expected to be expressed in unidentified osns. we are interested in which olfactory receptor genes are coexpressed. now, four types of olfactory receptor genes are known: odorant receptors   <cit> , trace amine-associated receptors   <cit> , vomeronasal type  <dig> receptors  and vomeronasal type  <dig> receptors  . however, it is technically hard to examine the coexpression of omp <dig> with receptor genes, because the copy number of them are very large. we thus focused on g-protein α-subunits  genes. it was simply believed that gαolf is coupled with both ors  <cit>  and taars  <cit> , gαo is coupled with v2rs  <cit> , and gαi <dig> is coupled with v1rs  <cit> . oka et al.  <cit>  have shown that some gα families are also duplicated in teleosts and are expressed in the oe, namely gαolf <dig>  gαo <dig>  gαo <dig>  and gαi1b  are expressed in the sensory area of the zebrafish oe. we performed the confirmatory analyses for the expression of the above genes by fluorescent in situ hybridization. we also exploratory chose four additional gα genes, gαi1a, gαi2a, gαi2b, and gαq , which seem to be well expressed in oe in rt-pcr  <cit>  for the in situ hybridization analyses. we were able to detect clear signals for only gαolf <dig>  gαo <dig>  and gαi1b; for the five other genes were not detected , probably because the expressions levels of these genes were too low and/or the number of cells expressing these genes were too small. first, we examined the expression of gαolf <dig> and gαo <dig> . gαolf <dig> was mainly expressed in the deep layer , whereas gαo <dig> was expressed in the superficial layer . merged images showed that gαolf <dig> and gαo <dig> were not coexpressed . it should be noted that a few gαolf2-expressing cells were in the superficial layer . the expression patterns of gαolf <dig> and gαo <dig> are similar to those of omp <dig> and trpc <dig> , respectively. we also confirmed that omp1-positive signals frequently overlapped with gαolf2-positive signals . second, we examined the expression of omp <dig> and three gα genes . interestingly, omp2-positive signals overlapped with the gαolf2-positive signals in the superficial layer , indicating that omp <dig> was expressed in the gαolf2-expressing cells whose cell bodies were situated in the superficial layer. in contrast, omp <dig> was not expressed in gαo2-expressing cells, although both genes were expressed in the superficial layer . omp <dig> was not expressed in the gαi1b-expressing cells, which were spottily and sparsely situated in the oe . these results strongly suggest that omp2-expressing cells coexpress gαolf <dig>  in addition, we examined the coexpression of omp <dig> with ora genes, which are similar to v1rs and retained only  <dig> copies in teleosts  <cit> , but none of them was coexpressed with omp <dig> .fig.  <dig> coexpression of omp <dig> and gα families. two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using dig- or fluorescein-labeled antisense riboprobes in horizontal sections of the adult zebrafish oe. a, d, g fluorescent images of alexa  <dig> derived from dig-labeled riboprobes. b, e, h fluorescent images of alexa  <dig> derived from fluorescein-labeled riboprobes. c, f, i merged images of  and ,  and , and  and , respectively. yellow two-headed arrows and cyan two-headed arrows indicate the superficial layer and the deep layer, respectively. dashed lines indicate the outlines of the epithelium. white arrowheads indicate cells that coexpress omp <dig> and another gene. scale bar, 20 μm



discussion
novel insight into the function of omp in the visual system
here we report that the two omps in teleosts are derived from 3r and have functionally diverged over the ensuing years. we showed the obviously non-canonical expression patterns of omp <dig> in the eyes of broad teleost species . omp <dig> appeared to be expressed in retinal horizontal cells in zebrafish . the expression of omp <dig> in the eyes is very interesting because omp has been believed to be an olfactory organ-specific protein  <cit> . unexpected finding of omp <dig> expression in the retina prompted us to investigate the omp of non-teleost fish to understand the ancestral state. we showed that relative expression level of gar omp was as high as that of zebrafish omp <dig> in the eye . this data underlies that the omp has been already expressed in the eyes of the common ancestor of bony fish. a recent study reported that omp is expressed in mouse cornea and proposed that omp might be involved in the developmental process of corneal epithelial cells  <cit> . we searched est database of mouse and xenopus, only to find no omp sequence from the eye or the retina . we also analyzed omp <dig> expression in zebrafish cornea by in situ hybridization and detected no omp2-positive signals in the cornea . we thus believe that omp <dig> is not expressed in cornea but expressed in retina of zebrafish. although there is slight discrepancy between mice and zebrafish in that the omp expression is detected in cornea of mice whereas omp <dig> in retina of zebrafish, the expression of omp gene in the visual system is expected to be an ancestral state . based on the above lines of evidence, we propose that the expression of omp <dig> in visual system of teleosts could be explained by subfunctionalization .fig.  <dig> model of omp evolution. ancestral omp was expressed in all gαolf2-expressing osns and possibly eyes . omp <dig> and  <dig> emerged after the 3r. because of subfunctionalization, omp <dig> is now expressed in the deep layer of the oe, whereas omp <dig> is in the superficial layer of the oe and retina



omp is colocalized with na+/ca2+ exchanger  <dig>  and is involved in the mechanism of ca2+ clearance in mouse osns  <cit> . the ncx <dig> ortholog is duplicated in zebrafish, and one of these, ncx1b, is expressed in zebrafish eyes as well as in other neural tissues  <cit> . thus it is possible that omp <dig> and ncx1b are colocalized and are both involved in the regulation of cations in teleost retinal horizontal cells. to further understand the mechanism underlying subfunctionalization in eyes caused by 3r, it is worth examining the gene expressions of omp and ncx <dig> of non-teleost fish as well as mice.

characterization of omp1- and omp2-expressing osns
teleost oe contains three types of osns: ciliated, microvillous, and crypt osns . generally, the cell bodies of the ciliated osns are situated in the deep layer of the oe, whereas those of microvillous osns are in the superficial layer. the crypt osns reside in the superficial layer of the oe. the axons of these three types of osns project to different regions of the olfactory bulb, suggesting that these osns have distinct functions  <cit> . we confirmed that omp <dig> was mainly expressed in the deep layer of the oe , and was coexpressed with gαolf <dig>  but not with trpc <dig> . these results indicate that omp <dig> corresponds to the previously characterized zebrafish omp  <cit> . in contrast, omp <dig> was expressed in the superficial layer , in which the cell bodies of microvillous and crypt cells are situated. so, we initially considered that omp2-expressing cells might be microvillous or crypt cells. however, this assumption seems unlikely because omp2-expressing cells also express gαolf <dig> , and neither microvillous nor crypt osns express gαolf  <cit> . furthermore, we examined the coexpression of omp <dig> with ora genes  <cit> . in particular, ora <dig> is expressed in zebrafish crypt osns  <cit> . although these genes were expressed in the oe, none of them was coexpressed with omp <dig> . recently, a fourth type of osn, kappe neuron, was identified, and these neurons are distributed in the superficial layer of the zebrafish oe  <cit> . they do, however, express gαo  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the omp2/gαolf2-coexpressing cells are most likely to be ciliated osns, in spite of the fact that cell bodies were distributed in the superficial layer. probably, they also coexpress some ors and/or taars. to definitively determine the cell type, a specific antibody against omp <dig> is required. nonetheless, the almost completely non-overlapping expression of omp <dig> and  <dig>  implies that omp1- and 2-expressing cells possess distinct roles in the oe.

subfunctionalization between omp <dig> and omp <dig> in the olfactory system
omp <dig> was expressed in the superficial layer of the oe , whereas omp <dig> was mainly expressed in the deep layer . the non-overlapping expression of omp <dig> and  <dig> can be explained by subfunctionalization, which is a model for paralog retention attributed to the reduction and specialization of expression. the 3r derived paralogs of omp in teleosts have partitioned their expression and perhaps function since the wgd event . given that a single omp gene is expressed in all of area of oe in mice and frogs, it is speculated that the single omp gene was expressed in all gαolf+ osns in the ancestral group . in addition, because the omp is known to play an important and fundamental role in signal transduction in osns , omp could be expressed in all osns of oe in the ancestral group that can be assessed by investigating the oe of non-teleost fish. we are now speculating that omp could be expressed in all gαolf+ osns in the spotted gar . at present, however, the expression data of spotted gar was lacking, making it difficult to examine in this study.

by focusing on two omps in teleosts, we proposed the scenarios of subfunctionalization of 3r-derived paralogs. to further verify this scenarios, it is important to incorporate the information about the ancestral states, which are represented by extinct species or close relatives of teleosts. the basal lineages of ray-finned fish , which did not undergo the 3r, could be ideal species to infer the ancestral state. accordingly, the expression pattern of omp in gar and/or polypterus, should be analyzed in detail based on in situ hybridization etc. in the near future.

other duplications of omp in vertebrate evolution
african clawed frog has two omps in its genome  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis suggested that xenopus omps emerged in the african clawed frog lineage. the african clawed frog is an allotetraploid animal  <cit> , and the most recent wgd was estimated to have occurred ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . accordingly, omp duplication in african clawed frog is likely to be derived from a xenopus-specific wgd. although the two xenopus omps show distinct expression patterns  <cit> , such expression patterns do not appear to be mutually exclusive. incomplete differentiation of xenopus omps is attributed to more recent wgd than 3r. two omps are also present in the salmon genome  <cit> . our results showed that both salmon omps are included in the omp <dig> clade. it is well known that another round of wgd occurred independently in the salmon lineage  <cit> . therefore, it is most likely that two salmon omp2s found in the present study emerged by this additional wgd. interestingly, it has been suggested that certain groups of genes tend to be specifically retained after a wgd event  <cit> , and omp would seem to be one of these genes. as salmon genome data become available, it will be interesting to attempt to locate omp <dig> for further analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggested that omp paralogs, which were derived from 3r, have been retained in visual and olfactory system by subfunctionalization . the expression pattern of omp in gar or polypterus  should be investigated to confirm this scenarios in the future study. in addition, we propose that omp <dig> could be used as a novel molecular marker of osns because omp <dig> and  <dig> were separately expressed in the oe. thus, the 3r-derived duplicated genes might become promising markers for the classification of various types of cells in the same organ, such as neural tissues.
