BACKGROUND
it is highly likely that sensory dysfunction is involved in various disorders of the lower urinary tract  including neurogenic bladder, outflow obstruction, idiopathic detrusor instability, overactive bladder, painful bladder syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy involving the bladder. in addition, chronic pathological conditions that cause tissue irritation or inflammation can alter the properties of sensory pathways, leading to a reduction in pain threshold and/or an amplification of painful sensation   <cit> . depending on the pathology, several mediators and their respective receptors have been proposed to modulate peripheral nerve plasticity in the lut, including but not limited to: purinergic receptors in general  <cit>  or p2x receptor in particular  <cit> , transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily  <dig>   <cit> , substance p acting on nk <dig> receptors  <cit> , protease activated receptors  <cit> , and nerve growth factor and its receptors  <cit> .

the new hypothesis being tested in this manuscript is that increased levels of vegf observed during bladder inflammation provoke nerve plasticity. this hypothesis is based on evidence indicating that nerves and blood vessels are associated, follow a common molecular pathway during development, and key molecules responsible for their development may continue to control their plasticity in adulthood  <cit> . the finding that mutant mice  lacking sensory nerves also present disorganized blood vessel branching  <cit> , suggests that local signals such as vegf supplied by nerve fibers, may provide a cue that determines blood vessel patterning. in contrast, administration of vegf can support and enhance the growth of regenerating nerve fibers, probably through a combination of angiogenic, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective effects  <cit> .

in this context, many proteins that were originally discovered to be required for axon guidance have recently been implicated in the development of the vascular  <cit>  and lymphatic systems  <cit> . perhaps the most striking observation is that angiogenic factors, when deregulated, contribute to various neurological disorders, such as neurodegeneration. the prototypic example of this cross-talk between nerves and vessels is the vascular endothelial growth factor, vegf  <cit> . although originally described as a key angiogenic factor, it is now well established that vegf also plays a crucial role in development of the nervous system  <cit> .

among the neuronal guidance molecules, neuropilins  and plexins, and their ligands, semaphorins and vegf have been extensively studied in the central nervous system. they represent large families of molecules that can transduce signals essential for the regulation of neuronal repulsion and attraction, cell shape, motility, and cell-cell interactions  <cit> .

plexins are similar to the toll-like receptors  in their evolutionary conservation from flies to mammals. in particular, plexin a <dig> has been shown to be required for bacteria and lps to engage tlr and trigger the downstream signal transduction pathway including activation of rac <dig>  c-jun n-terminal kinase, nf-kb and ap- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, plexin-a <dig> in macrophages is required for optimal cytokine production, including tnfα and il- <dig>  upon bacterial challenge  <cit> .

nrps are transmembrane glycoproteins that were initially identified as co-receptors for plexin that mediate the effects of class- <dig> semaphorins on axon guidance  <cit> . nrp- <dig> has high affinity for sema-3a, whilst nrp- <dig> homodimers have high affinity for sema-3f  <cit> . the diversity of function of these guidance molecules resides in their capacity to also function as co-receptors for vegf enhancing its binding to vegf receptors  <cit> . it has become clear that in the adult organism, nrps participate in many processes, such as angiogenesis and immune response  <cit> . nrp <dig> is associated with blood vessel development, whereas nrp <dig> was initially identified as a semaphorin receptor, and mediator of axon guidance  <cit>  and lymphatic vessel development  <cit> .

of relevance to the present study, nrps are highly expressed in the human  <cit>  and mouse bladder urothelium and intramural ganglia in close association with vegf receptors  <cit> . moreover, urothelial-related diseases and bcg-induced inflammation alter nrp expression and the accessibility of vegf to these receptors  <cit> . in addition, nrps also regulate neuronal plasticity as indicated by mutant mouse studies, showing that peripheral nerve regeneration is delayed in neuropilin 2-deficient mice  <cit> . the latter observation raises the question of whether upregulation of vegf and guidance molecule expression during inflammation would also lead to altered nerve plasticity.

little information is available regarding sema concentrations in non-malignant bladders. semaphorins are a large family of signaling proteins that are both secreted and membrane bound. a common theme in the mechanisms of semaphorin function is that they alter the cytoskeleton and organization of actin filaments and the microtubule network  <cit> . class  <dig> semaphorins  are the only secreted forms in vertebrates. among the class  <dig> semaphorins, sema3a has been most intensively studied in relation to axon guidance  <cit>  and intrathecally administered sema3a protein attenuates neuropathic pain behavior in rats with chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve  <cit> . sema3a shows repulsive activity toward a variety of neuronal types  <cit> . sema3a and its receptors  were found to be significantly increased during m-csf-mediated differentiation of monocytes into m <dig> macrophages of the inflammatory phenotype  <cit> .

relative to cross-talk among signaling molecules, it is interesting that vegf and semaphorins have opposite effects on the filopodia of both endothelial cells  and axons expressing neuropilins. sema3f, the semaphorin ligand of nrp <dig>  is known to repel nerves  <cit>  and endothelial cells  <cit> , whereas vegf <dig> attracts the filopodia, which drives the ecs or axons to move in the direction of the vegf gradient  <cit> .

for these studies, bcg was chosen to induce cystitis because it is known to: a) provoke a significant increase in vegf expression in the urinary bladder  <cit> , b) cause profound inflammation that is dependent on the vegf pathway  <cit> , c) up-regulate the urothelial expression of vegf receptors and nrps  <cit> , and d) induce il- <dig> up-regulation  <cit>  and its receptors that are necessary for nerve regeneration  <cit> .

the innovative results of this research provide evidence that chronic inflammation induces alterations of bladder peripheral nerve density that express: a) the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily  <dig>   <cit> , b) protein gene product  <cit> , c) substance p, and d) calcitonin gene-related peptide . results obtained with potent and specifically engineered neutralizing antibodies against vegf, nrp <dig>  and nrp <dig> further suggest a putative mechanism underlying inflammation-induced increase in peripheral nerve density. furthermore, instillation of vegf into the bladder recapitulated the effects of bcg on inflammation and nerve plasticity.

RESULTS
chronic instillation of bcg, vegf <dig>  and vegf <dig> result in bladder inflammation
as bcg  <cit>  and vegf <dig>  <cit>  once instilled into the mouse bladder are absorbed across apparently intact urothelium and systemically distributed  <cit> , we sought to compare the degree of inflammatory cell infiltrate in response to these stimuli. because vegf <dig> contains amino acid residues that bind to heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, it is partly diffusible and partly bound to the pericellular matrix  <cit>  which may explain its poor diffusion into deeper bladder layers. therefore, we decided to also test the vegf <dig> isoform that is freely diffusible  <cit> , since it lacks the basic amino acid residues responsible for heparin binding and, therefore, does not, or only minimally, binds to the extracellular matrix . figure  <dig> illustrates inflammation in response to chronic instillations of bcg, vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  this illustration shows a predominant cellular infiltrate in response to chronic bcg instillation, whereas vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> have a more profound impact in the bladder vascular system leading to dilation of both arteries and veins. higher magnification inserts are amplification of dashed square areas of the respective figures and illustrate inflammatory cells and perivascular infiltrates .

next, double immunofluorescence was used to further clarify whether the inflammatory infiltrate in response of bcg and vegf was composed of mpo+ and f4/80+ cells . quantitative analysis of mpo+ and f4/80+ cells indicate that chronic bcg instillation induces both neutrophils and macrophages infiltrations . in the sub-urothelium, bcg induced predominantly neutrophils  that were almost double the number of macrophage . these results are summarized on table  <dig> 

individual values illustrated on figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 13a were expressed as % of the respective pbs group and the average ± standard error of the mean are summarized.

as bladder instillation with bcg is known to provoke a significant increase in vegf levels  <cit>  concomitant to up-regulation of vegf receptors and co-receptors   <cit> , we tested whether bcg-induced inflammation was dependent on vegf. to remove the influence of vegf, an additional group of mice received systemic treatment with neutralizing vegf antibody twice a week, concomitant to four weekly instillations of bcg. the results presented in figure  <dig> indicate that neutralization of vegf by b <dig> resulted in a blunted inflammatory response characterized by a reduction of both neutrophils and macrophages towards baseline levels. as these results suggest that vegf participates in bladder inflammation, additional groups of mice received instillations of vegf <dig> and vegf <dig>  interestingly, both forms of vegf induced a predominant infiltration of macrophages in the sub-urothelial layer  and, to a lesser extent when compared to bcg , some neutrophil infiltration .

bcg-induced inflammation results in bladder nerve plasticity
in order to determine whether chronic bladder inflammation results in alteration of nerve density, we first determined the distribution of sensory nerves expressing the nociceptive transducer vanilloid type  <dig> transient receptor potential receptor  in the urinary bladder isolated from control mice. the results illustrated in figure 5a confirmed the reported distribution of trpv <dig> immunoreactivity  in the rat bladder  <cit>  and extend the results to nerves crossing the urothelial layer  or surrounding urothelial cells . trpv <dig> antibody specificity was verified by comparing the labeling of bladders isolated from c57bl/ <dig>  used as a positive control and trpv1-/- mice  <cit>  used as a negative control  to bladders from wt mice . no immunostaining was observed in bladders isolated from trpv1-/- mice , indicating that this antibody specifically identifies trpv1-ir in the urothelium, sub-urothelium, and detrusor nerve fibers . figures 6a and 6b are low magnification micrographs in order to illustrate the distribution of trpv1-positive fibers in several layers of the urinary bladder isolated from control  and inflamed bladders , respectively. regardless of magnification, figures 6a-b illustrate that inflammation induced a higher degree of trpv1-ir in the sub-urothelium of bladders isolated from bcg-treated mice that was confirmed by image analysis . next, we compared trpv1-ir with other nerve markers. for this purpose, tissues isolated from the same groups were also stained with antibodies identifying cgrp , pgp <dig>  , and sp . it was noted that pgp <dig>  and cgrp antibodies resulted in a non-specific labeling of the urothelial layer. a reasonable explanation for this artifact is that the methods recommended for permeabilization of the tissues caused such labeling. these findings precluded the use of the urothelium for quantification purposes, and image analysis was performed in two layers: the detrusor smooth muscle and the sub-urothelium that extended from the basal layer of the urothelium to detrusor. results obtained with image analysis indicate that bcg induced a significant increase in the pan-neuronal marker pgp <dig> -ir in the sub-urothelium and detrusor smooth muscle  and an increase in sensory nerve marker trpv1-ir, specifically in the sub-urothelium . bcg also induced a significant increase in cgrp- and sp-ir .

vegf mediates bcg-induced alterations in bladder nerve plasticity
it was reported that vegf is expressed in nerves at relatively higher amounts than in the surrounding mesenchymal tissue  <cit> , and a new appreciation of the role of vegf in neuronal development emerged  <cit>  that made us review a possible link between bcg-induced inflammation and bladder nerve plasticity with the activity of vegf. as neutralization of vegf by b <dig> resulted in a blunted inflammatory response to bcg , next we investigated whether bcg-induced alteration in nerve plasticity was also modulated by vegf. tissues obtained from mice that received pbs, bcg, or bcg and b <dig> were submitted to image analysis to quantify pgp <dig> - and trpv1-ir in the sub-urothelium and detrusor smooth muscle. the results presented in figures  <dig> indicate that neutralization of vegf by b <dig> completely blocked the capacity of bcg to increase pgp <dig>   and trpv1-ir  suggesting that the observed increase in nerve plasticity was mediated by vegf acting either directly or indirectly on the nerves. control experiments included treatment of mice with avastin that recognizes and neutralizes human vegf but is inactive against mouse vegf. avastin did not alter the enhanced innervation of the urinary bladder following instillation of bcg in mice .

blocking nrp antibodies
to further explore the mechanism involved in vegf mediated inflammation and nerve plasticity, we used nrp antibodies since blockade of neuropilin-vegfr coupling is significantly more effective than other approaches in decreasing vegf-vegfr <dig> signaling  <cit> . based on the capacity of nrp antibodies to significantly reduce lymphatic vessel proliferation and neutrophil migration during chronic bladder inflammation induced by bcg  <cit> , we tested whether the blockade of nrp <dig> or nrp <dig> with engineered antibodies would also alter the effect of bcg on bladder nerve density. figures 9a-d indicate that concomitant treatment with nrp1a or nrp1b did not change the capacity of bcg to induce an increase of trpv1-ir or pgp <dig> -ir. these results suggest that nrp <dig> may not be involved in bcg-induced bladder neuronal plasticity. surprisingly, blockade of nrp <dig> with a specific antibody  resulted in strong potentiation of bcg effects on sub-urothelial pgp <dig> -ir . regarding trpv1-ir, nrp2b did not further enhance the substantial increase in sensory nerves induced by bcg in the sub-urothelium . however, the combination of bcg and nrp2b treatments resulted in a significant increase of trpv1-ir in the detrusor muscle .

substance p and cgrp-ir positive nerves are also increased by the combination of bcg and nrp2b
to further explore the effects of combined therapy of nrp2b and bcg, we tested whether increased nerve plasticity was specific for trpv1-ir or a general effect on sensory nerves expressing other markers such as sp and cgrp. combined treatment of nrp2b and bcg induced a significant increase of cgrp-ir in the sub-urothelium  and detrusor muscle  and substance p-ir in the sub-urothelium .

vegf instillation induces bladder nerve plasticity
to provide direct evidence that vegf induces bladder neuronal plasticity, vegf <dig> and vegf <dig> were instilled into the mouse bladder either acutely  or chronically . in order to determine if the bladder responses to vegf <dig> have reached a plateau, an additional group received six weekly instillations of vegf <dig> and was euthanized  <dig> week after the last instillation. one week after a single instillation of vegf <dig> into the mouse bladder, a substantial increase in the number of pgp <dig> -ir and trpv1-ir fibers was observed, and this increase was at least double the basal number of nerves in the sub-urothelium and detrusor smooth muscle . after the 4th weekly treatment with vegf <dig>  a tempering of the response was observed. in addition to vegf <dig>  vegf <dig> significantly increases pgp <dig> -ir in nerves running into the detrusor smooth muscle  and trpv <dig> fibers in the sub-urothelium  and detrusor smooth muscle . table  <dig> summarizes these results.

differences between bladder responses to bcg and vegf
the effects of chronic instillation of bcg, vegf <dig>  or vegf <dig> into the mouse bladder on microvessel density and cell proliferation were conducted by determining the area of cd31-positive blood vessels an the expression of ki <dig>  figure  <dig> contains representative photomicrographs of cd <dig> positive microvessels along with the expression of ki <dig>  in tissues obtained from bcg-treated mice, ki <dig> expression was predominantly observed on urothelial cells  and to a lesser extend in cd31+ blood vessels  whereas in tissues isolated from vegf121-  and vegf165-treated mice , in addition to urothelial cells, a strong expression of ki <dig> occurred on cd31+ blood vessels. figure 13a compare the cd31+ microvessel density on tissues stimulated with bcg or vegf. figure 13b presents the quantification of ki <dig> taking the cd31+ cells as region of interest and indicates that in contrast to bcg, chronic vegf instillation into the mouse bladder induced angiogenesis.

discussion
this manuscript presents a body of evidence implicating vegf signaling in the enhanced innervation of the urinary bladders following instillation of bcg in mice. qualitatively these results add to a list of evidence implicating the vegf pathway in the bladder responses to bcg. a quantitative analysis of inflammatory infiltrate and vascular plasticity indicates possible alternative pathways activated by bcg and vegf.

the nervous and vascular systems share several anatomical parallels. both systems utilize a complex branching network of neuronal cells or blood vessels reaching all regions of the body. the anatomical similarity of the nervous and vascular systems suggests that axons might guide blood vessels and vice versa  <cit> . indeed, signal molecules produced by peripheral neuronal cells, such as vegf  <cit> , guide blood vessels  <cit> , and signals from vessels, such as the neurotrophins ngf and nt- <dig>  are required for, and orchestrate extension of neurons adjacent to vessels  <cit> . in this manner, the neuronal and vascular systems are well organized and coordinated in normal adult tissues. however, in chronic inflammatory states particularly in the lut, little is known about how the nerve-vessel relationship functions and whether it could underlie the chronic pain syndrome observed in certain patients.

interest in guidance molecules, and particularly vegf, modulating both vascular and neuronal pathology is emerging. vegf levels are associated with alterations in the bladder vascular system. vegf is increased in bladders of patients with painful bladder syndrome, and it is associated with glomerulations on hydrodistension  <cit> . however, increased bladder vegf is not observed in patients who failed to show petechial bleeding or in controls  <cit> . in addition, vegfr- <dig> and nrp <dig> expressions are reduced in bladder biopsies from patients with cystitis  <cit> .

we reasoned that pro-inflammatory stimuli known to increase vegf, and in particular nrp expression, might also modulate inflammation-induced nerve plasticity. the contribution of chronic inflammation to peripheral nerve plasticity was investigated in a murine model using bcg instillations that it is known to increase signaling molecules, such as il- <dig>  <cit>  and vegf  <cit> , that are necessary for inducing neuronal plasticity. our results confirmed our hypothesis that intravesical instillation of bcg increased the density of pgp <dig> -, sp-, trpv1-, and cgrp-ir within the bladder wall. for some parameters, the numbers of sensory nerves identified closely parallels numbers of pgp <dig>  immunoreactive nerves, which  could indicate that most pgp <dig>  fibers observed were peptidergic sensory nerves. however, further studies on sympathetic nerve staining and non-peptidergic nerve afferents are necessary to determine the whole extend of bcg- and vegf-induced neuronal plasticity.

a limitation of our experimental conditions is that concentrations of neutralizing antibodies and the pro-inflammatory stimuli were probably different among the different layers of the urinary bladder. the antibodies were systemically administered, whereas pro-inflammatory stimuli were instilled into the bladder. therefore, we analyzed the effects on both the sub-urothelium and detrusor muscle, and the results obtained seem to reflect differences in tissues that are in closer proximity to the stimulus. interestingly, bcg induced an increase of trpv1-ir in the sub-urothelium but not in the detrusor smooth muscle, whereas pgp <dig> -ir was found increased in both layers. as bcg favors an increase of inflammatory cells primarily in the sub-urothelial layer when compared to the detrusor muscle, these results suggest trpv1-ir, but not pgp <dig> -ir, is associated with the degree of inflammatory infiltrate. in this context, in the absence of inflammatory cell infiltrate, such as in il- <dig> knockout mice, a significant decrease in mechanical pain hypersensitivity was observed  <cit> . in contrast, when neutrophil infiltration was increased by administration of il- <dig>  a concomitant increase in neuropathic pain was observed  <cit> . furthermore, depletion of circulating neutrophils at the time of nerve injury significantly attenuated the induction of hyperalgesia  <cit> .

besides neutrophils and macrophages that were quantified in the present study, other inflammatory cells should be considered to have an action in neural plasticity. in particular, nrps are recognized as a new marker for regulatory t  cells  <cit>  and are expressed in antigen presenting cells and effector cells  <cit> . in addition to nrps, semas seem to participate in inflammation as it has been suggested that macrophages and fibroblasts secrete semas that may be responsible for reduced sympathetic innervation  <cit> . therefore, it is fair to propose that one possible mechanism by which chronic bcg instillation induces bladder neuronal plasticity is by attracting inflammatory cells that will contribute to increased tissue levels of vegf or sema.

at this time, there is not definitive evidence correlating the type of inflammatory cell involved in the regulation of bladder sensory nerve plasticity. however, given the known trophic effects of vegf on neurite growth  <cit>  prolonged survival of neurons  <cit> , and re-enervation following local nerve damage  <cit> , it is fair to propose that inflammatory cells producing vegf may be involved in the observed neural plasticity. this new appreciation of vegf signaling in bladder inflammation is supported by emerging evidence that levels of various vegf subtypes are, in general, increased at the site of inflammation, and that infiltrating lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells represent an additional source of vegf  <cit> .

the present work introduces intriguing results regarding nrps. as nrp <dig> has a domain structure strikingly similar to that of nrp <dig>  <cit> , we first tried to disrupt binding of vegf and sema to nrp <dig> using blocking antibodies that were engineered to block either the a1-a <dig> domain or b1-b <dig> domains of nrp <dig>  both antibodies, although proven to reduce bcg-induced inflammation, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling  <cit> , failed to alter the effects of bcg on nerve density. this suggests that either the antibodies are specific for impairing inflammation-induced angiogenesis or that nrp <dig> may not participate in mechanisms underlying neuronal plasticity in the urinary bladder. an alternative explanation is based on findings that spatial gradients of sema3a and vegf may promote differential nrp <dig> binding  <cit> . indeed, vessels expressing high levels of sema3a favor nrp1-plexina <dig> signaling, producing chemorepulsive cues limiting sympathetic neurite outgrowth and vascular enervation, while low sema3a expressing vessels favor nrp1-vegfr <dig> signaling that provides chemoattractive cues for sympathetic neurite outgrowth and vascular enervation  <cit> .

the unexpected increase in nerve density after nrp2b administration deserves further investigation and studies are underway in our laboratory to define the mechanism/s involved in bladder responses to this antibody. it is also interesting that nrp2b alone did not induce alteration of nerve density. however, when given concomitantly with bcg, nrp2b induced an overwhelming increase in bladder nerve fibers. one possible explanation is that nrp2b might potentiate nerve plasticity by activating angiogenesis or increasing the migration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. our preliminary results indicate that nrp2b alone does not alter bladder blood vessel density or the number of inflammatory cells . however, nrp2b does increase both f4/80+ macrophages and mpo+ neutrophils in response to bcg .

it seems that in addition to activate the vegf signaling pathway, bcg may have induced an increase in semas. this would explain the finding that nrp2b further increased the number of nerves when administered concomitant to bcg. as semas are known for strong chemorepulsion, these results suggest that blockade of nrp <dig> reduces sema participation and the consequent repulsion of neurons. although nrp2b antibody was originally developed to target the coagulation v/vii factor  domains of nrp <dig> which are required for vegf-c binding to nrps  <cit> , and the b1-b <dig> domains do not directly engage sema, this antibody could decrease sema binding by preventing nrp dimerization that is necessary for accommodating sema domains that pack tightly together at this interface  <cit> .

it is possible that other secreted semaphorins binding to nrp <dig> alone are responsible for the chemorepulsion and the consequent effect of nrp2b antibody on neural plasticity. nrp <dig> is known to be required for mediating repulsive actions of sema3b, 3c, and 3f, whereas nrp <dig> is known to be required for sema3a function. in fact, sema3b and sema3f seem to require only nrp <dig>  not nrp <dig>  to elicit their effects, whereas sema3c may require both nrp <dig> and nrp <dig>  <cit> . another piece of evidence indicating that nrp <dig> may play a role in altered nerve plasticity is the finding that peripheral nerve regeneration is delayed in nrp2-deficient mice  <cit> , indicating that this guidance molecule facilitates peripheral-nerve axonal regeneration.

we also found evidence that target-derived vegf <dig> or vegf <dig> plays a previously unrecognized role in promoting growth of bladder nerves and inflammation. a role for vegf in inflammation has been postulated. however, instillation of vegf into the mouse bladder represents direct evidence that vegf induces inflammation and that this new animal model can be used to investigate the effects of elevated levels of vegf on bladder neuronal and vascular plasticity.

a fundamental question raised by the present findings is whether the increased innervation occurred as a consequence of angiogenesis or inflammation. it is known that innervation typically accompanies blood vessels  <cit>  which made it important to determine whether the observed effects on nerves are direct, or mediated through effects on angiogenesis. this was a difficult topic to address facing the evidence indicating an overlap between inflammation and angiogenesis. we found that increased microvessel density  was part of the bladder responses to chronic instillations of bcg, vegf <dig>  and vegf <dig>  however, bcg did not induce a significant endothelial cell proliferations as indicated by ki <dig> and therefore, the increased mvd observed in response to bcg was probably related to the intense vasodilation known to be part of the inflammatory response. in contrast, proliferating endothelial cells were only observed in vegf-treated tissues and, therefore, it seems that angiogenesis underlies the bladder responses to vegf, as indicated by an increased ki <dig> expression on cd31+ endothelial cells  <cit> .

although an increase in nerve density, particularly those expressing trpv1-ir, has been proposed to underline pain sensation and neurogenic detrusor overactivity based on findings that desensitization of afferents with capsaicin and resiniferatoxin decrease pain and detrusor instability  <cit> , the present work did not explore whether the increased nerve density corresponded to an increased function of the sensory system. the primary goal of the present work was to explore putative mechanisms involved in inflammation-induced neural plasticity before conducting a detailed study on nerve function. our results were focused on the target organ, and future studies should include the consequences of vegf instillation on more central neurons such as those of the dorsal root ganglia. in this context, it should be recognized that while plasticity of the central nervous system  and regeneration  are mainly based on adaptive changes in neural circuits and synaptic reorganization, plasticity of the peripheral nervous system is predominantly based on axonal re-growth and neuron addition  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
vegf is not only involved in angiogenesis, but also in an inflammatory reaction and neuronal plasticity. chronic bcg administration into the mouse urinary bladder resulted in pronounced inflammation accompanied by increased density of pgp <dig> , trpv <dig>  sp, and cgrp nerves. bcg effects on inflammatory cells and nerves were nullified by neutralizing vegf antibody and qualitatively reproduced by intravesical administration of vegf <dig> or vegf <dig>  however, vegf-induced neural plasticity seems to associate with angiogenesis whereas bcg-induced neural plasticity seems to be a consequence of inflammation. concomitant administration of the vegf-inducer, bcg, along with neutralizing anti-nrp <dig> antibodies resulted in a surprising potentiation of neuronal plasticity, whereas nrp <dig> antibodies did not. the present work suggests the novel concept that both inflammation and angiogenesis can lead to increased bladder nerve plasticity.
