BACKGROUND
genomes of extant species are shaped by extensive gene loss and duplication events. in the radiation of vertebrate species, two whole genome duplication events at the base of the vertebrate lineage  ago)  <cit>  and a third round of genome duplication at the base of the teleost lineage  are proposed to play a crucial role  <cit> . duplicated genes are expected to be functionally redundant and therefore released of selective pressure, consequently leading to gene loss. nevertheless many duplicated paralogs are retained in modern genomes, for instance an estimated  <dig> - 24% of duplicated paralogs are present in extant teleost genomes  <cit> . the duplication-complementation-degeneration model seeks to explain the retention of duplicated genes by subfunctionalization, where the function of the essential ancestral gene is distributed to two genes, each fulfilling part of the ancestral gene's function due to regulatory mutations  <cit> . another most interesting possible event following gene duplication is neofunctionalization, in which one of the two paralogous genes is free to acquire a new function that differs from the ancestral gene, due to the essential  function being carried out by the unchanged paralog. such functionalization events may pave the way for speciation. an alternative driving force in speciation might be divergent resolution, where random paralog losses in two allopatric populations can lead to diversity  <cit> . while whole genome duplications are one way to increase the gene repertoire within a genome, tandem duplication events as well as lineage specific gene loss are other means to change the number of active genes , whose presence on glia cells or neurons is indispensable for precise and sustained synaptic activity  <cit> . eaats are involved in the removal of glutamate from excitatory synapses, a process not only essential to ensure precise termination of synaptic transmission but also to avoid neurotoxic accumulation implicated in a number of diseases  <cit> . moreover, transport of glutamate is associated with an increased chloride conductance across the membrane, which hyperpolarizes cells  <cit> . based on these important functions high-affinity glutamate transporters in the nervous system are supposed to be under strong purifying selection .

in mammals, five eaat genes  together with two neutral amino acid transporters form the 'solute carriers 1'  gene family . in these species eaat genes have diversified both in spatial and temporal expression and in functional properties and are expressed at glutamatergic synapses throughout the central nervous system. slc1a3/eaat <dig> and slc1a2/eaat <dig> are predominantly expressed in glia cells and presumably mediate the main load of glutamate re-uptake while eliciting only small chloride currents  <cit> . the neuronal transporters, slc1a1/eaat <dig>  slc1a6/eaat <dig> and slc1a7/eaat <dig>  exhibit larger chloride currents, especially the cerebellar slc1a6/eaat <dig> and the retina-specific slc1a7/eaat <dig>  <cit> .

slc <dig> = solute carrier family 1; eaat = excitatory amino acid transporter; both nomenclatures originally describe the gene families in man. slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> belong phylogenetically to the slc <dig> family, mediate however different functions than eaat and are therefore missing from the eaat nomenclature. data are based on the official hugo instructions http://www.genenames.org.

in teleosts, given the evidence for a third round of genome duplication , an increased number of slc <dig> genes are expected in their genomes. we indeed identified up to  <dig> slc1s in fish genomes. while some of these additional slc <dig> genes clearly are the consequence of the teleost specific r <dig>  others are evidently members of two additional subfamilies , that were lost in the lineage leading to human and mouse. interestingly members of these two subfamilies can also be found in prototherian, sauropsidan, and amphibian genomes, suggesting that these genes are specifically retained in these lineages.

RESULTS
the zebrafish genome contains  <dig> slc <dig> genes on separate chromosomal locations
as a basis to study the evolutionary history of a given gene family, we analyzed the abundance of slc <dig> genes in the zebrafish genome. while in the human and mouse  <dig> different members of the slc <dig> gene family have been described, we identified and annotated  <dig> slc <dig> family genes in the zebrafish genome. cloning from whole embryo cdna indicated that all of the  <dig> annotated slc <dig> sequences are indeed transcribed. sequencing of the amplified cdna fragments revealed no significant deviation from our predicted sequences, except for some sites of single nucleotide polymorphisms.

the fact that the slc <dig> gene family in zebrafish consists of nearly twice as many genes as present in genomes of human and mouse suggests that at least some of the zebrafish slc <dig> orthologs have originated from the teleost specific whole-genome duplication. physical and virtual mapping indicated that none of the sequences within a subgroup of slc <dig> are located within the same chromosomal cluster , supporting the hypothesis that the genes originated from whole genome duplications rather than from individual tandem duplications.

gene duplicates originating from whole genome duplications should be parts of large blocks of duplicated gene pairs, called paralogons. this holds true for slc1a3a/eaat1a and slc1a3b/eaat1b, which are located on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. moreover, these chromosomes are derived from a common protochromosome, further supporting a whole genome duplication event  <cit> .

the microsynteny analysis of slc1a2a/eaat2a and slc1a2b/eaat2b revealed that these genes are located within two chromosomal regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> that show multiple duplicated genes . these results confirm the assumption that also the chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are derived from a common protochromosom {taylor,  <dig> #97; postlethwait,  <dig> #208} the microsynteny analysis for the slc1a7a/eaat5a and slc1a7b/eaat5b genes however gave a more complex pattern. while the slc1a7b/eaat5b gene is located on a small chromosomal fragment on chromosome  <dig> that shows only a handful of genes with conserved synteny to the human chromosome  <dig>  the slc1a7a/eaat5a gene is located on chromosome  <dig> harbouring many genes that have a similar alignment on the human chromosome  <dig> . strikingly the scp <dig> gene, which on the human chromosome is adjacent to the slc1a7/eaat <dig> gene can also be found next to slc1a7a/eaat5a and slc1a7b/eaat5b genes in zebrafish, indicating that this region has been as expected duplicated during evolution.

evidence for the existence of additional slc <dig> subgroups
we subsequently analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of the identified zebrafish slc <dig> genes with their corresponding human and mouse orthologs. interestingly, zebrafish slc <dig> family members do not as expected segregate into  <dig> clearly distinguishable subgroups with two orthologs each, but rather show a variable number of zebrafish paralogs within the different groups . while in zebrafish only one ortholog for slc1a1/eaat <dig>  slc1a <dig>  slc1a <dig> and slc1a6/eaat <dig> exists, two orthologs for slc1a3/eaat <dig>  three orthologs for slc1a2/eaat <dig> and even four genes most closely related to slc1a7/eaat <dig> were found, suggesting that in zebrafish additional slc <dig> subgroups exist.

given this unexpected result, we analyzed slc <dig> gene families in other teleost genomes . even teleost genomes only distantly related to zebrafish displayed an almost identical number and phylogeny of slc <dig> family members as those identified in the zebrafish genome , suggesting that within the teleost lineage this number of slc <dig> family members is common. moreover, members within the defined subgroups slc1a2/eaat <dig> and slc1a7/eaat <dig> clearly segregate into two separate branches, suggesting that in teleosts two additional slc <dig> subgroups, now named slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig>  exist.

this assumption was supported by an analysis of the intron/exon structure of the additional subfamilies. while we found a high conservation of the exon number and their corresponding lengths within a given subgroup, the exon size in the newly defined subfamilies were altered .

slc <dig> gene retention and loss across vertebrate lineages
since we saw the loss of two slc <dig> subfamilies while comparing teleosts and euarchontoglires , we decided to extend our analysis to encompass the whole vertebrate tree . therefore we analyzed the genomic information from species, covering the main vertebrate lineages including marsupials, monotremata, sauropsides, and amphibiens . while the genomic information from the species used for the following analysis cover the main vertebrate lineages, a complete set of data can be found in additional file  <dig> , additional file  <dig> , and additional file  <dig> .

database analyses indicated that all therian species have lost slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig>  in contrast, the members of egg laying vertebrates  display various gene losses and retentions . monotremates  and birds have retained slc1a <dig> and lost slc1a <dig>  whereas the reverse pattern holds true for lepidosauromorphes  that have retained slc1a <dig> and lost slc1a <dig>  xenopus tropicalis, as a representative of the amphibians on the other hand has retained members of both subfamilies. interestingly, additional gene losses occurred in a variety of lineages. for instance, chicken  has lost slc1a <dig> and the green anole lizard  has lost slc1a <dig> .

phylogenetic reconstruction including now slc <dig> sequences from teleosts, amphibia, sauropsida and mammalia clearly indicates that the newly assigned slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> each form a separate clade .

in order to get an additional glimpse at the evolutionary history of slc <dig> genes, we analyzed the genomes of two basal vertebrates, namely the elephant shark  and the sea lamprey . the elephant shark, belonging to the cartilaginous fish, represents an independent evolutionary branch of the vertebrates, whose genomes are thought to have undergone the same number of genome duplications as the mammalian branch  <cit> . the low  coverage of the elephant shark genome prevented the assembly of complete slc <dig> cdna sequences. nevertheless, our comparison revealed only exons for one ortholog per subfamily, with the notable exception of the slc1a2/a <dig> subgroup, where we detected a retained slc1a <dig> ortholog. interestingly we also identified two paralogs of the slc1a2/a <dig> subgroup in the lamprey, a jawless vertebrate at the base of the vertebrate tree .

chromosomal location of putative human slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> remnants
in order to see if remnants of the slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> genes can still be found within the human genome, we performed a microsynteny analysis localizing genes flanking slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig>  interestingly, zebrafish slc1a8a and slc1a8b are both flanked by elavl <dig>  a gene that can be located to human chromosome  <dig> . this human genomic region shows a highly conserved synteny with regions flanking the zebrafish slc1a <dig> genes, suggesting that the inactivated human slc1a <dig> gene might originally have been located on chromosome  <dig> in the p <dig> / <dig> region . interestingly, the putative inactivated human ortholog of slc1a <dig> has also been located on chromosome  <dig>  however in contrast to slc1a <dig>  which is located on the shorter arm of the chromosome, slc1a <dig> has been located on the longer arm in the region q <dig> . this region also displays a highly conserved synteny, implying that the inactivated gene might indeed have been part of this chromosomal region. however, despite extensive attempts we were not able to identify sequences of the inactivated human slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> genes, suggesting that the degeneration of these genes has already progressed too far to allow detection.

furthermore synteny analysis in xenopus and chicken also revealed elavl <dig> in close proximity to slc1a <dig> within the same chromosomal fragment. similarly we found the nucb <dig> gene in the vicinity of slc1a <dig> in the xenopus and anolis genome .

the expression patterns of zebrafish slc1a3/eaat <dig> and slc1a2/eaat <dig> paralogs suggest subfunctionalization
as an example to compare the spatial and temporal expression pattern of duplicated genes, we investigated the expression patterns of the zebrafish slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> subfamily genes.

whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments show that slc1a3a transcripts can be found in glia cells of the larval zebrafish brain at  <dig> days post fertilization , similar to the expression of mammalian slc1a3/eaat <dig> in astrocytes of the brain.

we found non-overlapping expression for the slc1a3b/eaat1b paralog in neuromasts of the lateral line organ . neuromasts consist of sensory hair cells and support cells that are homologous to mammalian inner ear hair cells and their adjacent support cells. the observed expression is consistent with a comparable function of this transporter in neuromasts, as observed for the ribbon synapse of the mammalian inner ear  <cit> .

the slc1a2/eaat <dig> paralogs are both expressed in glia cells of the larval zebrafish brain  in a similar pattern to slc1a3a/eaat1a, which is consistent with slc1a2/eaat <dig> expression in mammalian astrocytes. in the retina, however, we found a complementary expression pattern with slc1a2a/eaat2a transcripts in the inner  and slc1a2b/eaat2b transcripts in the outer retina .

while the expression of zebrafish slc1a2b/eaat2b paralogs is in line with mammalian slc1a2/eaat <dig> expression in the outer retina, the slc1a2a/eaat2a expression in the inner retina has not been reported in mammals, suggestive of neofunctionalization.

taken together our expression data for the slc1a3/eaat <dig> and slc1a2/eaat <dig> paralogs reveal subfunctionalization events in the zebrafish, since each paralog fulfills presumably parts of the ancestral function as predicted by the duplication degeneration-complementation model  <cit> .

discussion
modern genomes are shaped by frequent duplication and deletion events. most dramatic are whole genome duplications that were prominently stated by susumo ohno as the most important driving force in the evolution of metazoans  <cit> . this idea has immediate appeal since it provides an elegant route to the generation of new functions without compromising essential ancestral gene functions. following the split from invertebrates, modern vertebrate genomes harbour remnants of two whole genome duplications  <cit> , and there is now overwhelming evidence that ray-finned fishes  had an additional whole genome duplication dating back about 320- <dig> million years ago   <cit> , leading to many unique teleost specific genes. while analyzing solute carrier family  <dig>  genes in zebrafish, we found as expected evidence for many duplicated genes. however, some zebrafish slc <dig> genes turned out to be not the result of the teleost specific r <dig>  further analyses ruled out the possibility that these slc <dig> genes originated from the teleost specific genome duplication. one possible explanation for these additional genes is lineage and species specific gene loss. this has long been recognized in unicellular organisms  <cit> . however more recent reports demonstrate that such events are also observed in vertebrate species  <cit> , where the impact of such species specific gene loss remains unclear. in the case of the slc <dig> family, where five of the seven human and mouse slc <dig> genes are grouped in the functionally defined excitatory amino acid transporter  family, in teleosts we found members of two additional subfamilies, now called slc1a8/eaat <dig> and slc1a9/eaat <dig>  in teleosts. these two subfamilies have been lost in all therian mammals. this is quite surprising, as these proteins are involved in the removal of glutamate from vertebrate synapses and are therefore likely under immediate selective pressure.

in order to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of this gene family we studied a number of vertebrate species from all major vertebrate lineages. we found representatives of both new subfamilies in all analyzed teleost species, showing that the existence of these genes is common to teleost species and is not restricted to zebrafish. analysis of amphibian genomes reveal the existence of one member of each slc1a8/eaat <dig> and slc1a9/eaat <dig> subfamily, arguing that the tetrapod ancestral species still contained the full complement of slc <dig> subfamilies. in this respect it is interesting to note that a study of glutamate transporters in the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum retina reports the cloning of a slc1a8/eaat <dig>  as well as a slc1a9/eaat <dig> gene   <cit> , which indeed group into the two new subfamilies . these findings provide additional evidence for a scenario where the genes of these subfamilies have been lost after the amphibia - amnionta split.

a clue to when the first subfamily was lost is provided by the sauropsida. here the lepidsauromorpha  have retained slc1a <dig> but lost slc1a <dig>  the situation is reversed in the archosauromorpha , where slc1a <dig> was lost but slc1a <dig> was retained. this suggests that the genome of the last common ancestor of the sauropsida still contained both subfamilies, followed by independent gene loss in the two branches of the sauropsida. following this logic the genome of the amniote ancestors should have contained members of both subfamilies.

in mammals only the protherian species  have retained the member of slc1a <dig>  while all other remaining mammals have lost members of both subfamilies. in the most parsimonious scenario the last common mammalian ancestor has already lost slc1a <dig> but has retained slc1a <dig>  subsequently slc1a <dig> was lost at the base of the therian lineage, whereas a member of this subfamily was retained in the branched off protheria species. hence the slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> subfamilies have been lost independently in a number of lineages. while for instance slc1a <dig> has been lost at least twice independently in the archosauromorpha and therian lineage, slc1a <dig> has been lost independently in the therian and lepidosauromorpha lineage. in order to infer the ancestral situation we assessed the slc1/eaat repository in species that are at the base of the gnathosomes.

genome information for two species of interest, the elephant shark  and the sea lamprey , is available. while the former represents the cartilaginous fish, an independent branch of the vertebrates that has split before the division of the tetrapod and the teleost lineage, the later belongs to a clade of skulled chordate animals lacking jaws. since both lineages branched off before r <dig>  cartilaginous fish as well as lampreys are expected to have undergone the same number of genome duplications as the mammalian branch. consequently the gene repertoire between lamprey, sharks, and mammals should be comparable  <cit> . while we found for each therian slc <dig> gene a corresponding elephant shark ortholog, we identified several exons of a retained slc1a <dig> ortholog, demonstrating that this basal species have retained members of additional slc <dig> gene families. interestingly we found only one exon sequence for a putative slc1a8/eaat <dig> ortholog in the lamprey and no trace of this gene in the elephant shark. this suggests that either this gene has been lost independently in both of these basal species  or that limited genomic information prevented us from identifying these corresponding genes.

up to now, we have focused our discussion mainly on the slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig> subfamilies. an interesting case is also the loss of slc1a6/eaat <dig> in the green anole lizard. this gene is not duplicated in any species analyzed and is prominently expressed in the cerebellum. we can only speculate that another slc <dig> gene in lizards must have taken over the function of slc1a <dig> in glutamate removal from cerebellar synapses. support for such a scenario comes from a study comparing the similarity of the glutamatergic sytem in the turtle chrysemys picta and rodents  <cit> .

we have documented multiple gene loss in vertebrate lineages, raising the question if traces of these lost genes can still be found in extant genomes. most of these gene losses must have happened many mya ago, so finding defunct gene sequences is rather unlikely. however by microsynteny analyses, we found the putative genomic location of both lost slc <dig> genes in the human genome. intriguingly both lost genes were most likely located on human chromosome  <dig>  while the putative slc1a <dig> location is on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> , the most likely position of the inactivated slc1a <dig> is on the long arm at position 19q <dig> . for this human chromosome extensive rearrangements within the short arm and many intrachromosomal breaks in the long arm have been reported, even since the time of primate rodent divergence  <cit> . therefore it seems well conceivable that many genes, including slc1a <dig> and slc1a <dig>  may have been rendered non-functional during these rearrangement events. our microsynteny analyses indicated that the elavl <dig> gene is in close proximity of both zebrafish slc1a <dig> genes, and that other genes in this region map like elavl <dig> to the human chromosome  <dig>  interestingly this synteny is conserved in chicken and xenopus, where elavl <dig> and slc1a <dig> are neighbors on chromosome  <dig>  and scaffold  <dig>  respectively .

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic analysis of a gene family spanning multiple taxa can yield important information about their evolutionary history. in the case of the solute carrier family  <dig>  consistent with the duplication-complementation-degeneration model, most of the  <dig> human or mouse orthologs have one or two teleost orthologs. however, for two teleost slc <dig> subfamilies we found no corresponding therian counterpart. this indicates that therians must have lost these two subfamilies, now named slc1a8/eaat <dig> and slc1a9/eaat <dig> 

these two subfamilies are not teleost specific, but can be found throughout different vertebrates. an analysis of the major vertebrate lineages revealed an intriguing pattern of lineage specific gene losses, shaping the phylogenetic history of slc <dig> genes. in all non-therian vertebrate species we found at least one member of the slc1a8/ <dig> subfamilies. amphibians have neither lost slc1a <dig> nor slc1a <dig>  lepidosauria  on the one hand have lost the slc1a <dig> ortholog, while birds on the other hand have lost slc1a <dig>  interestingly egg laying mammals  are the only mammals that have also retained a slc1a <dig> ortholog.

by studying one gene family across a number of vertebrate taxa, inferences can be made about the evolutionary history of these genes. such an analysis is needed to guide the interpretation of functional data obtained for those genes and provides a fascinating scenario to study the evolution of vertebrate gene families.
