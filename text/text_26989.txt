BACKGROUND
members of the genus bifidobacterium are gram-positive, obligate anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore forming bacteria
 <cit> , and are the most important constituents of human and animal intestinal microbiota
 <cit> . recently, news species of bifidobacteria have been described
 <cit>  and now more than  <dig> species have been included in this genus.

bifidobacterium spp. can be detected in various ecological environments, such as intestines of different vertebrates and invertebrates, dairy products, dental caries and sewage. considering the increasing application of bifidobacterium spp. as protective and probiotic cultures
 <cit> , and the fast enlargement of the genus, easy identification tools to discriminate new isolates are essential. moreover, their correct taxonomic identification is of outmost importance for their use as probiotics
 <cit> . conventional identification and classification of bifidobacterium species have been based on phenotypic and biochemical features, such as cell morphology, carbohydrate fermentation profiles, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of soluble cellular proteins
 <cit> . in the last years several molecular techniques have been proposed in order to identify bifidobacteria. most available bifidobacterial identification tools are based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, such as ardra
 <cit> , dgge
 <cit>  and pcr with the use of species-specific primers
 <cit> . however, 16s rdna of bifidobacterium spp. has a high similarity, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and bifidobacterial closely related species  or subspecies  even possess identical 16s rrna gene sequences
 <cit> . for this reason different molecular approaches have been tested based on repetitive genome sequences amplification, such as eric-pcr
 <cit> , box-pcr
 <cit>  or rapd fingerprinting analysis
 <cit> . these fingerprinting methods have the disadvantage of a low reproducibility, and they need strict standardization of pcr conditions. the use of different polymerases, dna/primer ratios or different annealing temperatures may lead to a discrepancy in the results obtained in different laboratories
 <cit> .

in recent years alternative molecular markers have been proposed for bifidobacteria identification  and ventura et al.
 <cit>  developed a multilocus approach, based on sequencing results, for the analysis of bifidobacteria evolution. the hsp <dig> gene, coding for a highly conserved 60 kda heat-shock-protein , has been evaluated for phylogenetic analysis in bifidobacteria by jian et al.
 <cit> . the sequence comparison of this gene has been already used for species identification and phylogenetic analysis of other genera  and enteric pathogens
 <cit> . a chaperonin database  is available on line, collecting bacterial and eukaryotic sequences 
 <cit> .

the purpose of this study is the development of a rapid, reproducible and easy-to-handle molecular tool for the identification of bifidobacterium species isolated from various environments. the protocol is based on the restriction endonuclease analysis of the pcr-amplified hsp <dig> partial gene sequence  with the use of a single restriction enzyme and has been tested on the  <dig> most widely distributed bifidobacterium species and subspecies. a diagnostic dichotomous key to speed up profile interpretation has also been proposed.

methods
bacterial strains and culture conditions
the type strains used to develop the technique are listed in table 
 <dig>  whereas the strains used to validate the method are reported in table 
 <dig>  the strains, belonging to buscob  collection, were isolated from faeces of human and animals and from sewage. bacteria were maintained as frozen stocks at −80°c in the presence of skim milk as cryoprotective agent. working cultures were prepared in tpy medium
 <cit> , grown anaerobically at 37°c and harvested at logarithmic phase.

* previously assigned taxonomic identification.

in silico analysis
an in silico analysis was performed for the evaluation of a suitable restriction enzyme. available hsp <dig> sequences had been retrieved from cpndb database and genebank, thanks to the work of jian et al.
 <cit> . in silico digestion analysis was carried out on fragments amplified by universal primers h60f-h60r
 <cit>  using two on-line free software: webcutter  <dig>   and http://insilico.ehu.es/restriction softwares
 <cit> . blunt end, frequent cutter enzymes that recognize not degenerated sequences have been considered in order to find a suitable enzyme for all the species . however in silico analysis had been performed also on sticky end enzymes .

dna extraction from pure cultures
10 ml of culture were harvested and washed twice with te buffer , resuspended in 1 ml te containing 15 mg lysozyme and incubated at 37°c overnight. cells were lysed with 3 ml of lysis buffer , 220 μl sds  and 150 μl proteinase k  and incubated for 2 hours in water bath at 60°c. one ml of saturated nacl solution was added and the suspension was gently inverted twice. pellets were harvested through centrifugation  at room temperature for 15 minutes. after the transfer of clean supernatants in new tubes, dna was precipitated with  <dig>  volumes of cold ethanol  and resuspended in 300 μl of te buffer
 <cit> .

amplification of gene hsp <dig> and restriction with haeiii
universal primers were used to amplify approximately 600 bp of the hsp <dig> gene in the bifidobacterium spp. investigated. these primers h60f gaggacacacgcacgt-3’) and h60r ccaaccgggcttacgc-3’) were designed by rusanganwa et al.
 <cit>  on the basis of the conserved protein sequences gdgttatv and avkapgfgd in hsp <dig>  amplifications were performed in 20 μl volumes with  <dig>  μm of each primer , 10 μl 2x hotstartaq plus master mix   and 150 ng/μl dna. the pcr cycle consisted of an initial denaturation of 5 min at 95°c followed by 35 cycles of denaturation , annealing  and extension . the pcr was completed with a final elongation of 10 min at 72°c. the pcr amplification was performed with a pcr verity 96-well thermal cycler . after amplification, the product was visualized via agarose gel  in 1x tbe buffer and visualized with ethidium bromide under uv light. a 100 bp dna ladder  was used as a dna molecular weight marker. bands were excised from agarose gel  and dna was eluted with nucleospin® gel and pcr clean-up  in order to avoid possible non-specific amplifications. 3 μl of the eluted dna was re-amplified in a 30 μl pcr reaction . bsa was added to the reaction . the pcr products  were checked for non-specific amplification on agarose gel. 20 μl  of pcr amplicons were digested with haeiii enzyme. restriction digestion was carried out for 2 h at 37°c in 30 μl reaction mixture with 1x sm restriction buffer ,  <dig>  μl haeiii  and water. digestion products were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under uv-light , after agarose gel electrophoresis , tbe 1x) at 210 v . a 20 bp dna ladder  was used. the obtained pictures were elaborated with a free software gnu image manipulation program  only to invert colors and increase contrast.

precast gradient polyacrylamide gels   were also used to obtain rflp profiles, in order to have a comparison with agarose gels. the vertical electrophoresis apparatus used was p8ds™ emperor penguin  with an adaptor for lonza precast gels. the run was performed at 100 v in tbe 1x.

diagnostic key
a dichotomous key was developed comparing in silico digestion results and the evaluation of visible bands with the use of imagelab™  <dig>  software .

RESULTS
in silico analysis
the analysis and comparison of restriction profiles obtained with in silico digestion of bifidobacterial hsp <dig> sequences allowed the identification of a set of appropriate frequent-cutter endonucleases that recognize non degenerated sequences. the restriction enzyme haeiii was found to give the clearest and most discriminatory profiles in theoretical pcr-rflp patterns, discriminating the majority of bifidobacterium type-strains tested . furthermore, the profiles of other strains, belonging to the investigated species, have been analyzed to confirm the conservation of rflp profiles within species.

+ hsp <dig> sequence of b. subtile type strain was not available in the press-time.

† the available sequences at genebank and cpndb belonged to b. thermacidophilum .

*subspecies not discernable.

amplification and restriction analysis of bifidobacterium spp
theoretical restriction profiles have been confirmed in vitro on agarose gel. the obtained fragments ranged from 16 bp to 339 bp . fragments lower than 25 bp were not considered as they did not help in species discrimination and in addition they co-migrate with primers. time course analysis of restricted samples showed the formation of a band of ~200 bp in several species due to an over-digestion  and this invalidated the rflp profiles. for this reason the protocol has been optimized at 2 hours restriction time. fragments greater than 360 bp were also not considered due to a possible incomplete digestion of such long fragments.

the obtained gels  show species-specific profiles for all type-strains other than b. longum and b. thermacidophilum subspecies. this technique does not allow the identification of the subspecies belonging to these species, which displayed identical rflp profiles. matsuki et al.
 <cit>  proposed specific primers to differentiate the subspecies of the species b. longum, while b. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum and b. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum can be differentiated according to zhu et al.
 <cit> . the proposed restriction analysis is efficient in discriminating very closely related species and subspecies as b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum/b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and b. animalis subsp. animalis/b. animalis. subsp. lactis.

the same method has been applied with the use of precast gradient polyacrylamide gels. the resolution was greater than that obtained on agarose gels, loading only 4 μl of the restriction reaction instead of the 30 μl used in horizontal electrophoresis. this may allow to reduce the volume of amplification reactions with a consequent reduction of costs.

the comparison between in silico digestion and the obtained gel profiles allowed to develop a dichotomous key  for a faster interpretation of the restriction profiles.

validation of pcr-rflp analysis on bifidobacterial isolates
 <dig> strains belonging to  <dig> different species/subspecies  have been investigated to validate the pcr-rflp technique. most of the strains tested were previously identified using biochemical tests and in some cases also molecular techniques . the obtained data confirmed a conservation of the profiles concerning the species and subspecies tested. two figures are available as additional files . about 95% of the strains confirmed the taxonomic identification previously assigned. two strains, b <dig> and su <dig>  previously classified as b. catenulatum and b. longum subsp. suis respectively, gave different profiles from those expected. the rflp profiles of b <dig> turned out to be the same of b. adolescentis atcc  <dig> , the dichotomous key confirmed the assignment to the b. adolescentis species. in addition, su <dig> was identified as a b. breve strain. these results were also verified through a species-specific pcr
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work a pcr-rflp based method to identify bifidobacterium spp. was developed and tested on strains belonging to different species. the technique could efficiently differentiate all the  <dig> species of bifidobacterium genus and the subspecies belonging to b. pseudolongum and b. animalis, with the support of an easy-to-handle dichotomous key. the technique turned out to be fast and easy, and presented a potential value for a rapid preliminary identification of bifidobacterial isolates.
