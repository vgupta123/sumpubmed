BACKGROUND
genetic, anatomical and functional studies provide compelling evidence that the vast majority of sweet taste perception is mediated by g-protein coupled receptors  of the tas1r-gene family, which comprises the members tas1r1- <dig>  <cit> . tas1rs belong to the class c gpcrs and are distantly related to the calcium sensing receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptors, v2r pheromone receptors, and gabab receptors  <cit> . in situ hybridization studies revealed that tas1r <dig> is coexpressed with tas1r <dig> or tas1r <dig> in taste receptor cells  <cit> . this observation suggests that the functional receptor, like other class c gpcrs  <cit> , may be a heteromer of two subunits. indeed, functional assays revealed that the combination of tas1r1+tas1r <dig> is activated by umami tasting compounds, while tas1r2+tas1r <dig> responds to sweeteners  <cit> .

the human sweet taste receptor is sensitive to the sweet proteins thaumatin, brazzein and monellin, the artificial sweeteners aspartame and cyclamate as well as to the sweet inhibitor lactisole whereas its rodent homolog is not  <cit> . this is in line with corresponding variations in sweet perception across species  <cit> . studies with chimeric receptors revealed that replacement of the large n-terminal extracellular domain of rat tas1r <dig> by its human counterpart created a receptor that responded to aspartame and neotame when coexpressed with htas1r <dig>  additional mutations in the n-terminal domain of human tas1r <dig> impaired the activation of the sweet taste receptor by aspartame, thus suggesting that the n-terminal part of tas1r <dig> is involved in the binding of these sweeteners  <cit> . similar studies showed that amino acids in the cysteine-rich region of human tas1r <dig> that connects the n-terminal extracellular domain to the segment containing the heptahelical domain determines the response to sweet proteins such as brazzein and monellin  <cit> . conversely, replacement of the heptahelical domain of rat tas1r <dig> by the corresponding part of the human receptor led to a chimera that responded to lactisole and cyclamate when coexpressed with rat tas1r <dig>  <cit> . this suggests that the binding sites for cyclamate and lactisole are located in the heptahelical domain of htas1r <dig>  indeed, mutational analysis in combination with molecular modeling studies of the heptahelical domain of tas1r <dig> revealed that the sweet inhibitor lactisole and the sweetener cyclamate have overlapping binding sites in the heptahelical domain of the human tas1r <dig> subunit  <cit> . recently, analysis of rat-human sweet taste receptor chimeras revealed that the heptahelical domain of htas1r <dig> is also crucial for the activation by the sweetener neohesperidin dihydrochalcone   <cit> . nhdc is added to various foods and beverages as a low caloric sweetener  <cit> , but its use is limited by some unwanted sensory properties such as a delayed onset and a long lingering menthol-licorice like sweetness  <cit> . thus, a detailed molecular understanding of the interactions of the sweet receptor with nhdc may contribute to the rational design of analogues with improved sensory properties. we therefore investigated the binding pocket of neohesperidin dihydrochalcone at the human sweet taste receptor.

RESULTS
analysis of receptor chimeras reveals that nhdc requires the human tas1r <dig> heptahelical domain
the isovanillyl compound nhdc  activates the human but not the rodent sweet taste receptor . in order to elucidate the putative binding site for nhdc, we cotransfected mixtures of plasmid dnas for the rat and human tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig> receptor subunits in hek293t cells stably expressing the chimeric g-protein g16gust <dig> and measured cellular calcium responses by fluorometry following bath application of various sweet tasting compounds. we found that nhdc elicited calcium responses in cells transfected with human tas1r <dig> and rat tas1r <dig> cdna, whereas it did not in cells transfected with the opposite combination . by replacing the heptahelical domain of rat tas1r <dig> with that of human tas1r <dig> we produced a chimeric receptor that was sensitive for nhdc when coexpressed with rat tas1r <dig> . in marked contrast, all receptors that contain the entire rat tas1r <dig> or its heptahelical domain did not respond to nhdc . notably, although the amplitudes and the response pattern of the receptor chimaeras varied  we can demonstrate that all tested receptor chimeras were functional because they could be activated by at least one sweetener . these results clearly indicate that the heptahelical domain of tas1r <dig> appears to be crucially involved in the activation of the sweet receptor by nhdc.

receptor activation by nhdc is competitively inhibited by lactisole
recently, it has been shown that the binding sites for the sweetener cyclamate and the sweet inhibitor lactisole overlap in the heptahelical domain of tas1r <dig>  <cit> . we therefore reasoned that the nhdc binding site might also overlap with that for lactisole. in this case one would expect that lactisole competitively inhibits the activation of htas1r2/htas1r <dig> by nhdc and cyclamate. in contrast, receptor activation by sweeteners that bind to other sites should be allosterically inhibited. to verify this assumption we recorded concentration-response curves for nhdc, cyclamate, acesulfame k and aspartame in the presence of different concentrations of lactisole in cells expressing htas1r2/htas1r <dig> .

in line with these expectations lactisole did not alter the ec <dig> values for acesulfame k but reduced the signal amplitudes up to ~75% , suggesting that it is an allosteric inhibitor of acesulfame k. likewise, lactisole diminished the signal amplitudes induced by aspartame , which is consistent with an allosteric inhibition of aspartame-mediated receptor activation. interestingly, in case of aspartame, the pronounced reductions in signal amplitudes were accompanied by a right-shift in the ec <dig> values . this may be due to an influence of lactisole on the aspartame binding site by negative cooperativity  <cit> . in contrast, lactisole did not diminish the signal amplitudes elicited by nhdc or cyclamate . instead, lactisole clearly increased the ec <dig> values of these compounds ~fourfold . this observed competitive inhibition suggests that the binding sites for lactisole, cyclamate and nhdc overlap in the heptahelical domain of human tas1r <dig>  interestingly, we observed slope changes for two of the four tested compounds. while aspartame and acesulfam k had constant hill slope of ~ <dig> the hill coefficient for nhdc in the presence of  <dig>  μm,  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm lactisole was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the calculated hill coefficient for cyclamate was  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this may be best explained by allosteric effects and may therefore indicate the existence of additional interaction sites either for lactisole or for the sweeteners  <cit> .

nhdc interacts with residues of the lactisole and cyclamate binding site
next, we investigated which amino acids of the binding sites for lactisole or cyclamate are critical determinants for receptor activation by nhdc. therefore, we analyzed the effect of  <dig> point mutations  in the heptahelical domain of htas1r <dig> that have previously been shown to influence receptor sensitivity to cyclamate or lactisole  <cit>  on the sweet receptor's response to nhdc. the effects were measured by recording calcium responses in hek293t-g16gust <dig> cells coexpressing htas1r <dig> and the various htas1r <dig> mutants. cells expressing the mutant h734a <dig>  did not respond to nhdc, cyclamate, aspartame or acesulfame k . we assumed that this mutation generally impairs the function of the receptor and excluded it from further analyses. seven receptor mutants  showed ec <dig> values for nhdc similar to that of the wild type receptor , suggesting that these residues have no impact on the action of nhdc on the sweet receptor. the eight remaining tas1r <dig> mutants, q637e <dig> , s640a <dig> , h641a <dig> , h721aex <dig>  f730l <dig> , w775a <dig> , f778a <dig> , and l782a <dig>  showed at least eightfold higher ec <dig> values for nhdc than the wild type receptor . the decreased sensitivities of these eight mutant receptors were specific for nhdc since their ec <dig> values for aspartame were not altered . additionally, immunocytochemical analysis revealed similar expression patterns for all examined tas1r <dig> receptor variants . thus, the increased ec <dig> values suggest that q <dig> , h <dig> , s <dig> , h721ex <dig>  f <dig> , w <dig> , f <dig> , l <dig>  are important for the activation of the sweet taste receptor by nhdc.

modeling of the nhdc binding site predicts interactions with additional residues in the heptahelical domain of tas1r3
to further elucidate the binding mode for nhdc, an alignment of the seven transmembrane helices of the htas1r <dig> with the transmembrane helices of bovine rhodopsin was performed . amino acids were extracted at helix positions critical for binding of retinal and then combined in a one dimensional amino acid vector, called ligand pocket vector   <cit> . amino acids in the tas1r <dig> lpv were considered as likely candidates to affect binding of nhdc. classical homology models imply to have the quality of an x-ray crystal structure and therefore overstress specific, in detail unknown, rotamer conformations of the amino acids. despite of the substantial progress in building homology models and independently of the level of sophistication of the techniques used, there always remains the risk of a mismatch between optimized rotamers and ligand binding requirements, leading to the rejection of ligands in docking experiments. we therefore designed a simple tm binding pocket pharmacophore  to avoid atomic details tending to mask this inherent uncertainty and to concentrate on the general topology of the binding site and the approximate relative orientation of charged, donor/acceptor and neutral side chains. only amino acid residues are shown which were identified as important for the action of nhdc by site-directed mutagenesis. nhdc was manually docked into the pharmacophore. for the docking process in addition to our results also data from structure-activity relationships of ring substituted dihydrochalcone sweeteners reported by whitelaw et al.  <cit>  were taken into account. these studies reported that the hydroxyl group in the b ring system at c <dig> of 3'-carboxyhesperitin dihydrochalcone is essential for its sweet taste. moreover, the introduction of a carboxylic acid at the c3' position in the a ring system enhances the sweetness of the dihydrochalcone structure. projecting this knowledge onto the chemical structure of nhdc suggests that the oh group in the c <dig> position is important for receptor-ligand interactions and the c3' position should be in close proximity to h <dig>  . furthermore, h <dig>  was already proposed to interact with the carboxylic acid of lactisole  <cit>  and the mutational studies of the present report indicate that the binding pockets of these two compounds do indeed overlap. the proposed binding mode of nhdc also suggests an interaction of the hydroxyl group at c <dig> with s <dig>  and the hydroxyl groups at c6' and c2' of nhdc could potentially interact with polar amino acids located in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  such as h <dig> , q <dig> , and c <dig>  respectively . in addition, favorable hydrophobic interactions between the b phenyl ring of nhdc could be envisioned with v <dig>  and f <dig> , and between the linker of the a and b phenyl ring with l <dig>  and g <dig> . furthermore, the model  predicts additional putative interaction sites, such as an interaction between the c3-hydroxylgroup of nhdc with s <dig>  in tm <dig>  moreover, the polar sugar moieties of nhdc could be interacting with polar amino acids of tm <dig> and tm <dig>  e.g. y <dig> , t <dig> , r <dig>  and s <dig> .

validation of the model by functional analysis of additional mutants
to verify the predictions of the model we selected  <dig> additional amino acids in htas1r <dig>  as candidates that might also influence the activation of the sweet receptor by nhdc. to test their impact on the receptor function we created fourteen htas1r <dig> variants  and tested their responses to nhdc by calcium imaging after coexpression with htas1r <dig> in hek293t-g16gust <dig> cells. the results show that the mutant receptors v621l <dig>  and c801l <dig>  could not be activated by nhdc, cyclamate, aspartame and acesulfame k , suggesting that these mutants are not functional. therefore, we excluded them from further analyses. the receptor mutant l800f <dig>  responded to nhdc in a manner similar to the wild type receptor , suggesting that l <dig> is not important for receptor activation by nhdc. ten receptor mutants  had five to sixteen fold increased ec <dig> values for nhdc  and one mutant, g804v <dig> , did not respond to nhdc at any tested concentration . the effects of these mutants were specific for nhdc because they all showed similar ec <dig> values for aspartame . moreover, the functional differences were not correlated with different expression levels or reduced signal amplitudes . the changes in the ec <dig> values suggest that these mutations directly affect the activation of the sweet taste receptor by nhdc, thus validating our model.

receptor variants that affect the nhdc response are shown in bold. values are given as average over at least three independent experiments ± sd. n.f. no response to any tested sweetener, n.r. no response to neohesperidin dihydrochalcone up to highest tested concentration , but responses to other sweeteners. , ec <dig> not calculable because saturation is not reached .

some of the newly identified residues also influence the interaction of the sweet receptor with lactisole or cyclamate
since our results indicate a partial overlap of the nhdc binding site with those for lactisole and cyclamate, we next asked, if any of the newly identified residues also affect the sweet receptor's responses to these compounds. to this end, we tested all mutant htas1r <dig> subunits by coexpression with htas1r <dig> in hek293t-g16gust <dig> cells for their sensitivity to lactisole and cyclamate . while we essentially confirmed the findings of jiang et al.  <cit>  that amino acids in positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , 721ex <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , 790ex <dig>  and  <dig>  of htas1r <dig> contribute to the sensitivity of the sweet receptor to cyclamate and/or lactisole, we found additional amino acids in the heptahelical domain of htas1r <dig> that altered the responses of the sweet receptor to the two compounds. the mutant receptor w775a <dig>  failed to respond to lactisole , suggesting that this residue is crucial for the sensitivity of the sweet receptor to the inhibitor. the mutants c801i <dig>  , y699l <dig>  , and y699f <dig>   showed three- to fivefold reduced responses to lactisole compared to the wild type receptor . thus, we conclude that the amino acid positions y <dig>  and c <dig>  also contribute to the inhibition of the sweet receptor by lactisole. the mutants c801i <dig>  and w775a <dig>  could not be activated at any tested concentration of cyclamate indicating the importance of these residues for the sweet receptor's responsiveness to cyclamate . in addition, the mutant receptor s726a <dig>  displayed more than fivefold lower sensitivity to cyclamate  than the wild type receptor , suggesting that all three residues contribute to the receptor's ability to be activated by cyclamate.

discussion
nhdc binds in the heptahelical domain of tas1r3
several independent lines of evidence clearly demonstrate that nhdc interacts with specific amino acid residues in the heptahelical domain of the tas1r <dig> subunit. first, lactisole, which interacts with the heptahelical domain of tas1r <dig>  <cit> , inhibited the activation of htas1r2/htas1r <dig> by nhdc competitively, while sweeteners that interact with other parts of the receptor were allosterically inhibited . second, the functional analysis of rat/human tas1r2/tas1r <dig> chimeric receptors showed that nhdc activated all chimeric receptors that contain the heptahelical domain of human tas1r <dig>  in contrast, all chimeras that contained the heptahelical domain of rat tas1r <dig> could not be activated by nhdc . third, seventeen amino acid exchanges in the heptahelical domain of htas1r <dig> specifically reduced the nhdc responses but did not influence the responses to aspartame , which interacts with the extracellular n-terminal domain of tas1r <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the finding that nhdc activates the human sweet receptor but not the rat sweet taste taste receptor delivers a molecular basis for the well-known lack of nhdc preference in rodents  <cit> . in addition, our results confirm previous findings that functional differences between rat and human sweet receptor  <cit>  are caused by sequence variations in the heptahelical domain of tas1r <dig>  <cit> .

elucidation of the nhdc binding site
to further understand the interaction between nhdc and the heptahelical domain of htas1r <dig> we established a simple 3d receptor pharmacophore model of the nhdc binding site. notably, in the model each amino acid residue in the heptahelical domain of the tas1r <dig> receptor is identified by its position. moreover, the numbering system proposed by ballesteros and weinstein  <cit>  is shown as superscripts to facilitate the comparison with results of other gpcrs. the model considers results obtained from our functional studies, available data about the suggested binding modes of cyclamate and lactisole  <cit> , information about conserved amino acids in gpcrs  <cit> , and sensory studies of nhdc derivatives  <cit> . these sensory studies have shown that the hydroxyl group in c <dig> of the b ring is crucial for the sweet taste of dihydrochalcones  <cit> . in line with these findings, our receptor model proposes that this hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds with either of the two serine residues in positions  <dig>  of tm <dig> and  <dig>  of tm <dig>  the possible interaction of the c <dig> hydroxyl group with both serines can explain why mutations at either position strongly reduced but not completely abolished the responses of the receptor to nhdc.

the model also predicts that h <dig> , q <dig> , and c <dig>  can form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups in the a ring as suggested by the decreased ec <dig> values for nhdc of the corresponding mutants. in addition, our model predicts that hydroxyl groups of the sugar moieties interact with y <dig> , r <dig> , and s <dig>  in tm <dig> and tm <dig>  indeed, mutations in these positions impaired the interaction of nhdc with the receptor. notably, the aglycon hesperitin dihydrochalcone that lacks the sugar rings also tastes sweet  <cit> . therefore, it might be conceivable that amino acids at these three positions are less important for the activation of the sweet taste receptor by nhdc, but rather enhance its affinity. furthermore, the methoxy group at position c <dig> of the b ring is in close proximity to v <dig>  and f <dig>  and is therefore likely engaged in favorable hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of these amino acids as concluded from the shift in ec <dig> values for nhdc at the corresponding mutant receptors.

the binding sites for nhdc, cyclamate and lactisole share amino acid residues
the sweet inhibitor lactisole, which interacts with specific residues in the heptahelical domain of tas1r <dig>  <cit> , inhibited the activation of the sweet receptor by nhdc and cyclamate competitively . these results suggest that the binding sites of lactisole, cyclamate, and nhdc overlap. interestingly, the observed competitive effects between nhdc and lactisole  may also explain why lactisole in contrast to many other sweeteners did not inhibit the sweet taste of nhdc in humans  <cit> . a previous report of jiang et al. proposed that cyclamate and lactisole interact with a common set of amino acid residues <cit> . our findings confirm this observation by showing that seven mutations  influence both, the lactisole mediated inhibition and the cyclamate induced activation of the sweet receptor . while cyclamate and lactisole only use parts of the tas1r <dig> pharmacophore, our model predicts that nhdc uses most of it due to its larger size . in line with these predictions, eight of the seventeen amino acids that alter receptor activation by nhdc , also influence lactisole-mediated inhibition of the receptor. similarly, nine of the seventeen residues  mediate activation by cyclamate, while six  influence receptor inhibition by lactisole as well as receptor activation by cyclamate .

our mutational analysis identified four additional amino acid residues that have not previously been recognized  as interaction partners for lactisole and cyclamate  <cit> . these residues nicely refine the model proposed by jiang et al. by enabling additional interactions between the two compounds and tas1r <dig>  this finding supports the validity of our model and suggests that it is compatible with that of jiang et al.

transmembrane domains six and seven are generally involved in gpcr activation  <cit> . the following observations suggest that the four residues w775a <dig> , f778a <dig> , l782a <dig> , and c801i <dig>  of tm <dig> and tm <dig> could participate in conformational changes of the sweet taste receptor from the ground to an active state and vice versa. firstly, f <dig>  and w <dig>  are highly conserved across class a and class c gpcrs  <cit> . secondly, our study showed that mutations at these positions alter the receptor's sensitivities to the agonists nhdc and cyclamate as well as to the inhibitor lactisole. thirdly, jiang et al. also found that mutations in position l782a <dig>  abolished activation of the sweet taste receptor by cyclamate and enhanced the receptor's responsiveness to the inhibitor lactisole  <cit> .

the amino acid residue c <dig>  in tm <dig> also affects the sensitivity of the sweet taste receptor to cyclamate, nhdc and lactisole. while it is in the proximity of the nhdc and cyclamate binding sites, it is quite remote from that of lactisole . this argues against a direct interaction of lactisole with c <dig> . it is therefore conceivable that in addition to w <dig> , f <dig> , and l <dig>  in tm <dig>  c <dig>  in tm <dig> may also play a general role in the activation process of the sweet taste receptor. this assumption is further supported by the observation that amino acids in tm <dig> of the calcium sensing receptor such as v <dig> , q <dig>  and a <dig>  play a key role in the activation of this receptor  <cit> .

notably, aspartame, which likely interacts with the n-terminal domain of htas1r <dig>  <cit>  could activate the mutants w <dig> , f <dig> , l <dig>  and c801i <dig>  in a manner, similar to the wild type receptor . therefore, it might be possible that tastants that bind to different receptor sites elicit different types of active confirmations as has been observed before for the activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor by salbutamol and catechol  <cit> .

the nhdc binding site overlaps with the binding sites of allosteric modulators in other class c gpcrs
sequence comparisons revealed that nine of the amino acid positions in htas1r <dig> that influence the sensitivity of the sweet receptor to nhdc, cyclamate or lactisole correspond to residues that are responsible for binding allosteric modulators in the calcium sensing receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptors   <cit> . this suggests a general role for these positions in allosterism in this class of receptors and shows that positions of allosteric binding sites are partly conserved amongst class c gpcrs. thus, critical determinants found in non-taste receptors are good candidates to uncover additional binding sites for sweet and umami tasting substances or modulators.

CONCLUSIONS
our mutational analysis combined with functional studies and molecular modeling identified the binding pocket of nhdc in the heptahelical domain of human tas1r <dig>  we found that the binding pocket of nhdc overlaps with those of the sweetener cyclamate and the sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. seven of the amino acid positions crucial for activation of htas1r2/htas1r <dig> by neohesperidin dihydrochalcone are involved in the binding of allosteric modulators of other class c gpcrs. this suggests a general role of these amino acid positions in allosterism and points to a common architecture of the heptahelical domains of class c gpcrs.
