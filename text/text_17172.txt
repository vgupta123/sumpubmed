BACKGROUND
in the past  <dig> years there has been a remarkable increase in the use of quantitative trait loci  mapping as a tool to uncover the genetic control of traits. initially, a major motivation was a desire to locate useful genomic regions for use in marker-assisted selection  in breeding programmes. increasingly, there is also a desire to identify the underlying genes responsible of agronomically or ecologically important qtls. in addition to the great advances in genomics, such as whole genome sequencing, snp discovery, transcriptomics and screening of large mutant libraries, progresses facilitating gene discovery have also been made in the area of biostatistics. an important example of this is the facilitation of meta-qtl analysis which uses data from independent experiments, each providing data on qtl position and confidence interval, to estimate the number of underlying "true" qtls and obtain a more accurate estimate of meta-qtl positions. meta-analysis allows distinctions between pleiotropy and close linkage to be made with greater confidence and provides a smaller region of the genome to explore for the underlying candidate genes.

most commonly, meta-analysis of qtls is applied to the compilation of data from independent mapping populations. examples of this kind of analysis in plants include flowering time in maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> , nematode resistance in soybean  <cit> , blast resistance in rice  <cit>  and fibre development in cotton  <cit> . by definition, a meta-analysis is the combined analysis of multiple experiments and it can be used to provide a thorough analysis of one mapping population that has been used in multiple experiments  <cit> .

the bala × azucena population of f <dig> recombinant inbred lines was developed in  <dig>  <cit>  and has been screened for root traits in controlled environments and for performance under drought in the field for the principle purpose of identifying qtls for root traits in rice that might contribute to drought resistance. the initial motivation was to provide targets for marker-assisted breeding and, to that end, qtl information obtained from the population was used to identify four root growth qtls that have subsequently been used in a mas programme  <cit> . the population has also been used to study the stability of qtls across environments  <cit> . a great deal of data has been generated on root growth and plant performance under drought. a compilation of this data has not been formally attempted until now. doing so will aid attempts to identify positional candidate genes for the drought avoidance and root growth qtls identified and help answer questions related to the pleiotropic effect of the underlying genes, which may prove very valuable in narrowing down positional candidate genes based on known function.

here, a meta-analysis of root growth, drought avoidance and related plant growth qtls is conducted. the value of analysis for distinguishing between pleiotropy and close linkage and in providing accurate locations for qtls is explored using four exemplary loci. in order to facilitate wide use of these data, we provide a data set allowing the linking of the bala × azucena map to the rice sequence .

RESULTS
distribution of qtl across the genome
figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the heat map generated from the one lod confidence intervals of qtls. most markers used in the bala × azucena map can be aligned to the genetic and physical map of the international rice genome sequencing project sequence of rice  <cit>  ; this information is provided in additional file  <dig>  this will facilitate comparative genomics of the large data set analysed here with other studies in rice or other species.

chromosome  <dig> had a region of high qtl density around b1065e <dig> for drought avoidance traits . the region was also active for plant height, leaf morphology, plant mass and root morphology. root qtls also concentrated slightly above rm <dig> and near the short arm telomere at p0509b <dig> 

on chromosome  <dig>  the highest density region was near c <dig> where  <dig> qtls for root traits overlapped. regions of high root qtl density were also present below g <dig> and below rg <dig>  while there was a cluster of qtls for leaf morphology at rm <dig> and clusters for drought avoidance above rg <dig>  near c <dig> and near the aflp marker a <dig> 

the maximum density of qtls on chromosome  <dig> was only  <dig>  most of which were leaf morphology qtls near the long arm telomere  of the chromosome. this region also carried a cluster of qtls for plant height and plant mass, a cluster of leaf morphology qtls and a small concentration of drought avoidance qtls. notable clusters for root qtls were found at rg <dig>  the aflp a <dig>  and below c <dig>  for drought qtls two clusters near the short arm telomere, below rm <dig> and at rg <dig>  were visible, but most notable was a broad cluster from rz <dig> to below r <dig> on the long arm.

the most qtl dense region of chromosome  <dig> was near marker rg <dig> where  <dig> root qtls overlapped. root qtl activity appeared notable across most of the long arm of the chromosome. leaf morphology qtl clusters were observed at rm <dig>  and rg <dig>  while for plant height a cluster matching the root cluster below rg <dig> was apparent. four clusters for drought avoidance were visible, near rg <dig>  a broad area from above c <dig> to rm <dig>  a region between rm <dig> and rm <dig> and a region at rm <dig> 

on chromosome  <dig>  each trait had only one region of qtl clustering. for root traits,  <dig> qtls overlapped near marker rz <dig>  in the same place as a cluster of plant height qtls. notably higher  were clusters for drought avoidance, leaf morphology and plant mass.

two regions of reasonably high qtl density  were detected on chromosome  <dig>  root qtls at r <dig> near the centromere and drought avoidance on the long arm at rz <dig>  both these trait categories had qtl clusters at the short arm telomere near c <dig>  which also carries qtls for plant height, while another drought cluster co-localized with the main root cluster near r <dig>  no notable activity for leaf morphology or plant mass was detected on chromosome  <dig> 

chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> carried qtl clusters for root and drought traits. for chromosome  <dig>  the most dense cluster was at rm <dig> where  <dig> qtls for drought avoidance overlapped. close by  was a dense cluster of root qtls. a less dense cluster of root qtls were also apparent at c <dig>  and in a diffuse region around c <dig>  while notable drought regions were c <dig>  g <dig> and above rg <dig>  also noteworthy, however, was a cluster of plant mass qtls between c <dig> and pip, which, although from rather few individual qtls, represented one of the strongest clusters of plant mass seen in this study. on chromosome  <dig>  the densest qtl cluster was located near r <dig> with  <dig> root qtls. marker rim2a also was linked to a small root qtl cluster while there was a notable cluster of drought avoidance qtls near g <dig> 

chromosome  <dig> had a very dense region of  <dig> root qtls just below marker rm <dig>  but there might be two additional root qtl clusters, above g <dig> and below g <dig>  there was very little additional qtl activity on this chromosome, but some evidence of drought avoidance qtl at p0569e <dig> and of plant height at rm <dig> 

chromosome  <dig> had the least dense cluster, with  <dig> qtls for drought overlapping at marker rm <dig>  drought avoidance activity was widespread across the top half of the chromosome. weak clusters of plant height  and root  qtls were also apparent.

the only notable region of chromosome  <dig> was composed of  <dig> root qtls at marker c <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> root qtls clustered at marker g <dig>  while plant height qtls clustered at the short arm telomere, at g <dig>  g <dig> was also near a weak cluster of drought avoidance qtls, and there was another one between markers rm <dig> and rg <dig> 

on the basis of the analysis described above, four regions were considered valuable examples for the purpose of addressing specific questions related to genetic architecture. those questions were the precision of the qtls position, the presence or absence of multiple qtls on individual chromosomes and the distinction between pleiotropy and close linkage. these regions were; the dense drought avoidance qtl cluster at the bottom of chromosome  <dig> which might indicate pleiotropy with plant height and/or root traits; the qtl cluster on chromosome  <dig> which appeared to indicate one qtl for root and height traits, which did not overlap one for drought avoidance and leaf morphology; the drought avoidance qtl cluster at the top of chromosome  <dig> which appears in figure  <dig> to be composed of two distinct meta-qtls; and the root growth qtl cluster on chromosome  <dig>  for which figure  <dig> suggests there might be  <dig> separate meta-qtls.

full meta-analysis of chromosome 1
in order to establish whether the cluster of drought avoidance qtls at the bottom of chromosome  <dig> was pleiotropically related to plant height and root traits, a meta-analysis using biomercator was conducted. in the first phase,  <dig> analyses were conducted, one for each trait category, with every qtl detected on that chromosome included. figure  <dig> gives an example of the output, giving the best fit model for the  <dig> plant height qtls which map to chromosome  <dig>  it shows that  <dig> meta-qtls were detected, the upper one near marker rm <dig> with  <dig> individual qtls, the middle one near marker rm <dig> with  <dig> individual qtls and the lower one near marker b1065e <dig> with  <dig> individual qtls.

a full summary of the first phase meta-qtl analysis of chromosome  <dig> is presented in the second and third column of table  <dig>  for drought avoidance,  <dig> qtls were used and the analysis indicated that there were, most probably, four meta-qtls on the chromosome, at  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm. for leaf morphology, the analysis indicated  <dig> meta-qtls from  <dig> individual qtls; for plant mass it was  <dig> meta-qtls from  <dig> individual qtls. for root qtls, the model with the lowest aic value was that with more than  <dig> qtls. therefore the individual qtls were split into two groups and analysed separately. the split was located in a qtl-free region between  <dig> and  <dig> cm since there were  <dig> qtls above this region and  <dig> below it. this revealed the presence of  <dig> meta-qtls for roots on chromosome  <dig>  every trait category had a meta-qtl in the region of  <dig> to  <dig> cm .

in this first phase of meta-analysis, no control was included over the number of individual qtls entered into the analysis for each screen. it was considered possible that, for some screens, multiple qtls could be detected for obviously pleiotropic traits and used in the meta-analysis  and that this would bias the mean position and confidence interval of the meta-qtl. therefore it was thought prudent to include a conservative second phase analysis in which only one qtl for each independent screen of each experiment was used in the analysis. where a choice of individual qtls was possible, the qtl with the highest r <dig> value was selected. the results are presented in the 5th column of table  <dig>  in most cases the mean position was close to that of phase  <dig>  but the confidence interval was slightly larger because less individual qtls were used. for plant mass, the 2nd phase meta-qtl was  <dig> cm below the 1st phase meta-qtl.

the plant height meta-qtl was located at  <dig>  cm, only  <dig>  cm from the marker b1065e <dig> at  <dig>  cm. b1065e <dig> is an indel marker designed on bac clone b1065e <dig> which contains the sd <dig> gene. this is the semi-dwarfing gene   <cit>  which has been partially sequenced in bala, showing that bala had the  <dig> loss-of-function deletion first identified in semi dwarf cultivars dee-geo-woo-gen and ir <dig>  partial sequence of azucena revealed it had the functional version of the gene. since this gene is within  <dig>  cm of the position of the plant height meta-qtl, it validates the approach being used here.

the sd <dig> gene, however, did not fall into the confidence intervals of the meta-qtls for drought avoidance, leaf morphology, plant mass or root traits. this suggested that sd <dig> was not responsible for the cluster of non-height qtls in this region. the confidence intervals of the leaf morphology and root meta-qtls did not overlap that of the drought meta-qtl. two clear and important conclusions from this analysis are apparent; sd <dig> is not a candidate gene for drought avoidance, root or leaf qtls in this region; and root and leaf morphology qtls here did not contribute to drought avoidance in this population.

full meta-analysis of chromosome 5
the phase  <dig> meta-analysis of chromosome  <dig> detected up to three meta-qtls for each trait category . it was notable, however, that every category had a meta-qtl between  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm where the majority of individual qtls were placed. the second phase analysis concentrated only on these meta-qtls. the meta-qtl position did not change by more than  <dig>  cm from that of the first phase. comparing the confidence intervals, it appeared that the meta-qtls for drought avoidance overlapped substantially with those of leaf morphology and plant mass, but not with the plant height and root meta-qtl while plant height and root trait meta-qtls were essentially overlapping. leaf morphology and plant mass meta-qtl confidence intervals, which overlapped considerably, also overlapped at the extremes with the other traits. the simplest interpretation of these results was that there were  <dig> pleiotropic meta-qtl here, one at around 76– <dig> cm affecting drought avoidance, leaf morphology and plant mass, and another at  <dig> cm which affected plant height and root traits.

full meta-analysis of the top of chromosome 7
as revealed in figure  <dig>  there is a region near the bottom of chromosome  <dig> at rm <dig> where several drought avoidance traits map. higher up around the centromere, there is a region where there appears to be two close qtl clusters, one at c <dig> and the other at g <dig>  markers that are  <dig>  cm apart. a meta-analysis was conducted only for the higher clusters to test the hypothesis that there are indeed  <dig> meta-qtls here. the best model using  <dig> individual qtls indicated that there was only  <dig> meta-qtl, not  <dig>  at position  <dig>  cm . the phase  <dig> analysis confirmed the conclusion and position, although the confidence interval, naturally, was larger. in both phases  <dig> and  <dig> of the analysis, therefore, the confidence interval was quite large . nonetheless, the result suggested that, despite the fact that in the heat map there appeared to be two groups of drought avoidance qtls whose  <dig> lod confidence intervals did not overlap, as revealed by a region of blue  between the two clusters, the meta-analysis of biomercator concluded they all belonged to one meta-qtl.

drought
full meta-analysis of root traits on chromosome 9
meta-analysis was conducted only on root traits on chromosome  <dig> to elucidate the number of meta-qtls for the trait and get an accurate estimate of their position. a total of  <dig> individual qtls were used in the first phase. three meta-qtls were identified all within a  <dig> cm region , at  <dig>  cm ,  <dig>  cm  and  <dig>  cm .

the upper meta-qtl contained individual qtls in positions ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cm and was dominated by root mass qtls from the thin rhizotron experiment  . from this experiment, four of the qtls were qtls for root mass in the 60– <dig> cm depth layer, two were qtl for root mass in the 90– <dig> cm depth layer, one was a qtl for total root weight and two were qtl for root/shoot ratio. two qtls for root penetration ratio from experiment  <dig> and for root/shoot ratio in experiment  <dig>  were also grouped in this meta-qtl. the middle meta-qtl contained individual qtls for root thickness and mass from experiment  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , but not for hydroponic root traits. the lower of these three meta-qtls grouped mostly deep root trait qtls  and only qtls from experiments  <dig> and  <dig> 

second phase analysis using only one qtl per screen gave very similar mean positions for the two lower meta-qtls but the upper one shifted from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. this may be attributable to the fact that only a few individual qtls were used to place this meta-qtl, and indeed, only  <dig> could be used in the second phase. this low number of individual qtls introduces a large confidence interval for this meta-qtl and it must be considered that the position reported here is only approximate

discussion
identifying consensus qtls by meta-qtl analysis
a great deal of qtl data from multiple experiments related to drought obtained using the bala × azucena mapping population has been compiled in a meta-analysis using two approaches. the first, illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  gives a heat map of  <dig> lod ranges and clearly shows genomic regions rich in meta-qtls for drought avoidance, shoot and root growth traits. the exercise has confirmed the presence of some regions previously identified as noteworthy. for example, a marker-assisted selection programme has introduced four genomic regions of azucena into the indian upland variety kallinga iii with the aim of improving root growth  <cit> . these regions are all revealed as regions of meta-qtls for roots in figure  <dig> . while the chosen regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> stand out, it does appear that other regions might have been selected to be equally valuable as chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  such as the regions around rz <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  rz <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  r <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  r <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and g <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  however, a limitation of the meta-analysis presented here is it does not account for the direction of the allelic effects. thus for the meta-qtls on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the positive root alleles come from bala, while for the qtls on chromosome  <dig> the positive alleles come from both parents in different experiments. this indicates that a screening of the qtls to be included in the meta-analysis is needed, and groups of qtls having opposite direction effects should be constituted and treated separately. previous reporting of individual experiments on field performance highlighted a number of regions carrying qtls for drought avoidance traits . the exercise here has identified two regions of interest for drought avoidance that had not appeared notable in individual experiments. these are the meta-qtls on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> . this information is being used to compile lists of candidate genes in each region to identify gene standing out because they are present in multiple drought avoidance loci.

coincidence of drought avoidance qtls with those of other traits
the first qtls for physiological traits in rice  <cit>  demonstrated co-localization of qtls for field drought avoidance traits with qtls for root traits measured in a controlled environment. since then attempts have been made to confirm the relationship between roots and drought avoidance. the subject is not reviewed here, but the information presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> can be used to examine co-localisation of qtls in this population in order to provide insight into physiological mechanisms underlying the drought avoidance qtls. from figures  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> clusters of qtl for drought avoidance were considered notable, one on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  two on chromosome  <dig>  three on chromosome  <dig> and four on chromosome  <dig>  a clearly recognisable cluster of root qtls is co-localizing with only five of these clusters . for the qtls around pip and rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  however, the direction of allelic effects of the drought avoidance qtls and root qtls are opposite; the azucena allele improved drought avoidance but reduced root traits. thus for only three drought meta-qtls, can it be speculated that drought avoidance may be provided by root systems allowing increased access to water at depth.

six of the drought avoidance qtls appeared to be associated with plant height  while one  co-localized with qtls for leaf morphology. in three cases, examination of allelic effects reveals that the taller plant alleles are associated with more severe drought symptoms. in the case of the qtls on chromosome  <dig> near rg <dig> and that on chromosome  <dig> near rz <dig>  there is no consistent pattern of allelic effect, with positive alleles for both height and drought avoidance coming from both parents while in the case of chromosome  <dig>  the allele for shorter plants is associated with more drought symptoms. on chromosome  <dig> the azucena allele generally reduces symptoms of drought  and it appears to reduce leaf area and weight, but increases chlorophyll content .

thus for a significant number of drought avoidance qtls identified in the bala × azucena population , the results do not indicate even possible theories about the underlying physiological mechanism. interestingly, three of these regions match the eight clusters of drought responsive genes and previously identified qtls for osmotic adjustment that have been recently reported  <cit>  . thus it is not unreasonable to hypothesise that osmotic adjustment, which has not been assessed in this population, may be the underlying mechanism in these meta-qtls. of the  <dig> high qtl density regions for clusters of root qtls apparent in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  most did not appear to co-localize with plant height or leaf morphology high qtl density regions. there are only three exceptions, the strong cluster of root qtls on chromosome  <dig> and the weaker clusters at the top of chromosome  <dig> and the upper qtl on chromosome  <dig>  this firmly establishes that root traits are not strongly related to shoot traits in rice, unlike in some other cereals like barley  <cit> .

these analyses imply that root qtls do not contribute to drought avoidance in this population. however, as previously argued  <cit> , caution is called for in reaching a firm conclusion on this issue because theoretically roots will only contribute to drought avoidance under certain circumstances . aspects of soil properties have not been adequately addressed in studies on this population  with the exception of experiment  <dig>  <cit> .

accuracy of qtl position
it is still a matter of debate whether qtl analysis accurately reports qtl position or not. price  <cit>  showed that, for  <dig> qtls which had either been cloned or accurately tagged, and for which the original qtl peak position was available, the distance from gene to qtl position averaged less than  <dig> cm, even for relatively small-effect genes. the conclusion that original qtl mapping can be accurate is confirmed to some extent here in the only case where the underlying gene responsible for a meta-qtl is know with any certainly; i.e. the sd <dig> gene for plant height on chromosome  <dig>  in that case,  <dig> individual qtls with lod scores ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , r <dig> values of  <dig> % to 28% and peak positions from  <dig> to  <dig> cm were combined into one meta-qtl right on top of the gene. there is no relationship between the lod score or r <dig> value and the distance from the individual qtl peak position and the meta-qtl position, suggesting that the strength of the qtl is not related to accuracy which contradicts theory since heritability and precision are theoretically linked  <cit> . however, only 38% of individual qtls were within  <dig> cm of the gene and 55% within  <dig> cm, suggesting that multiple qtl experiments do need to be conducted if accurate positions of relatively small qtls are to be obtained.

quantifying the number of qtls in a genomic region
one use of meta-qtl analysis is to identify if a genomic region that displays qtl activity really represents one, two or more underlying loci. this information is crucial if accurate qtl positions are to be obtained for marker assisted selection or listing positional candidate genes. here, two examples of the value of meta-analysis for this goal are given. in the case of the top of chromosome  <dig> where figure  <dig> suggests there are two clusters of high qtl density for drought avoidance, the meta-analysis reveals there is most likely only one. in the case of chromosome  <dig> where figure  <dig> suggests the presence of two or three regions of high qtl density for root traits, the meta-analysis confirms that three are present, greatly increasing the accuracy with which each can be located on the genome.

distinguishing between pleiotropy and linkage
another crucial question in qtl analysis is the degree to which the loci display pleiotropy as distinct from an apparent pleiotropy that results from close linkage. strictly, the analysis can only reject pleiotropy in favour of close linkage and not the other way around since linkage between adjacent genes is not likely to be broken. here we tested two cases where the distinction between pleiotropy and close linkage was not obvious. on chromosome  <dig> where meta-qtls for all  <dig> categories of traits are present within a  <dig> cm region, figure  <dig> suggests that both pleiotropy and close linkage may be acting since there appears to be meta-qtl for drought avoidance and leaf morphology in the same place, and meta-qtls for plant height, mass and root traits lower down. the full meta-analysis confirms the presence of close linkage since it indicates no overlap in the confidence intervals of drought with root or plant height meta-qtls. the situation for the plant mass and leaf traits is not conclusively elucidated because their meta-qtl positions are between those of the drought avoidance and both the root/height meta-qtls, and because the confidence intervals of those meta-qtls are quite large due to the lower number of individual qtls used.

in the case of chromosome  <dig>  figure  <dig> does not help in deciding if the presence of meta-qtls for all traits near rz <dig> is due to close linkage or possible pleiotropy. the full meta-analysis, however, indicates strong evidence for close linkage in relation to a meta-qtl for drought avoidance above a meta-qtl for root traits. the confidence interval of the drought avoidance meta-qtl overlaps that of the plant height and plant mass qtls but not that for leaf morphology. this suggests that if the drought avoidance qtl is pleiotropically related to shoot growth traits, it can be only with plant height and not with leaf length. indeed, the plant height and leaf morphology traits do not appear to be pleiotropic, suggesting that the semi-dwarfing gene sd <dig> is not the only gene in this region affecting shoot growth traits.

CONCLUSIONS
other than generally advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of qtl distribution, the main practical value of meta-qtl analysis is in the proposed ability to provide an accurate estimate of qtl position which will be useful in marker assisted selection and candidate gene identification. for marker assisted selection, the accurate location can be used to design ideal markers that reduce the likelihood of target gene loss due to distance between marker and gene. the greater resolution afforded for distinguishing between pleiotropy and close linkage is also valuable because it will allow breeders to target qtls that have been neglected in the passed because they were thought to be pleiotropic with qtls for undesirable traits but are now revealed to be distinct and separable by recombination. for example, the region of chromosome  <dig> described here which affects drought avoidance and plant height should be separable from the region that affects leaf length.

for the identification of positional candidate genes underlying the qtl, the meta-analysis should prove highly valuable. the confidence intervals obtained in this exercise vary from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm with an average of  <dig>  cm which compares favourably with the average  <dig> lod interval for individual qtls in this population of approximately  <dig> cm using composite interval mapping. while  <dig>  cm is still on average about  <dig> genes in rice , it is an amount that is becoming tractable as genomic resources and knowledge of gene function improves.
