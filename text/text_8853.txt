BACKGROUND
pseudomonas fuscovaginae  is a gram-negative, fluorescent pseudomonad and a member of gamma proteobacteria  <cit> . pfv is one of the  <dig> validly described pseudomonas plant pathogenic species, which are part of the oxidase positive cluster  <cit> . this bacterium was first identified and reported as a pathogen of rice  in the temperate region of japan in  <dig>  <cit> . it has now been described in several other regions of the world where rice and other gramineae food crops are cultivated including burundi  <cit> , madagascar  <cit> , mexico  <cit> , the philippines  <cit> , nepal  <cit> , brazil  <cit> , china  <cit> , iran  <cit>  and more recently in malaysia  <cit>  and australia  <cit> . pfv causes brown sheath rot disease in rice and also in other gramineae food crops including maize , sorghum  and wheat   <cit> . brown sheath rot symptoms on rice plants appear at all growing stages. at the seedling stage symptoms start with yellow to brown discoloration on the lower leaf sheath which later turns into grey-brown to dark-brown and ultimately, the infected seedlings rot and die. in mature rice plants pfv symptoms can be observed on flag leaf sheaths, other leaf sheaths and also on the panicles. under severe infection conditions, the entire leaf sheath becomes necrotic and dries out. spikelets of emerging panicles may be discoloured, sterile or symptomless, except for small brown spots  <cit> .

a successful infection by a phytopathogenic bacterium is not a single step process and is coordinated by several functions including bacterial adherence, movement, colonization, invasion, and suppression of host immunity. type iv pili are one of the best characterized adhesins in pseudomonas pathogens and it has been shown to be involved in several functions including adhesion in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola  <cit> , epiphytic fitness and survival in p. syringae pv. syringae  <cit>  and p. syringae pv. tomato  <cit>  and also in surface motility and virulence in p. syringae pv. tabaci  <cit> . the colonization process in pseudomonas plant pathogens has been associated with exopolysaccharides  shown to be involved in biofilm formation, epiphytic fitness and virulence  <cit> . the invasion process of plant pathogens has also been linked with secretion of several cell wall degrading enzymes including pectinolytic enzymes, cellulases and lipase through protein secretion systems  <cit> . plant pathogenic bacteria also have strategies to suppress the host defense responses induced during the infection process by secretion of effector proteins directly into the host cell through a type iii secretion system   <cit> . in addition to these functions, phytopathogenic pseudomonads produce several phytotoxins including coronatine, syringomycin, syringopeptin, phaseolotoxin, tabtoxin, and mangotoxin  <cit> . quorum sensing  signaling and its role in virulence has also been studied in several pseudomonas species including p. aeruginosa  <cit> , p. syringae pv. syringae  <cit>  and p. fuscovaginae  <cit> .

to our knowledge no genetic and molecular studies or screening for virulence-associated systems/functions in pfv have been reported. only a few biochemical studies have shown the production of three phytotoxins; namely syringotoxin, fuscopeptin a  and fuscopeptin b   <cit>  which have been shown to be able to generate the disease symptoms. we reported the role of the two qs systems in causing brown sheath rot by pfv in rice  <cit>  and have also determined the first draft genome sequence of a highly virulent pfv strain  <cit> . in this study an in planta screening of  <dig> genomic tn <dig> mutants has provided some insight into the virulence associated functions in pfv.

RESULTS
screening of p. fuscovaginae tn <dig> mutants for altered virulence in planta
as there are no major reports regarding virulence functions of this emerging phytopathogen, we performed an in planta screen of  <dig> tn <dig> genomic mutants to identify genes and/or pathways that might influence pfv virulence potential. a tn <dig> mutant bank of pfv was generated as described in the materials and methods section and  <dig> insertion mutants randomly selected and numbered from  <dig> to  <dig> were tested for virulence on plants of chenopodium quinoa. in this screen c. quinoa was chosen as a plant model over rice because the infection protocol for pfv is simpler to perform in c. quinoa compared to rice and therefore more suitable for a high-throughput screen involving many mutants  <cit> . plant inoculations were performed as described in the materials and methods section and virulence was assessed using the virulence score from  <dig> to  <dig> as previously described  <cit>  and presented here in additional file  <dig>  in the first round of screening we obtained  <dig> mutants that were altered for virulence compared to wild type. in order to verify the results, the  <dig> mutants were re-assessed for virulence in three biological replicates using two independent plants . we then obtained a total of  <dig> mutants  that displayed consistent and a significantly reduced virulence compared to wild type pfv . none of the mutants were affected in their growth pattern when grown in liquid rich media .table  <dig>

in order to verify the virulence deficiency of identified mutants, infection assays were carried out using both c. quinoa and rice plants. it was of interest to test all the identified mutants in both models as the strain pfv upb <dig> was first isolated as a rice pathogen. rice infection was performed by syringe inoculation  as described in the materials and methods section and virulence was assessed using the virulence score from  <dig> to  <dig> and also by measuring the lesion length . in rice,  <dig> out of the  <dig> selected mutants had similar behaviour as in c. quinoa, being reduced in virulence when inoculated with a higher dose of bacteria . three other mutants were also found with reduced virulence, although the virulence level was not significantly different compared to wild type. surprisingly, pfv  <dig> on the other hand showed a similar level of virulence compared to wild type in rice .figure  <dig>

validation of the genetic screening by re-generation of knock-out mutants in the same loci and their genetic complementation
in order to further verify the virulence phenotype of selected tn <dig> mutants, all mutants in the nine loci were independently re-generated via homologous recombination as described in the materials and methods section. in addition we also complemented three tn <dig> mutants  by identifying the genomic region harbouring each of the three loci from a cosmid library. we re-assessed the virulence phenotype of the nine tn <dig> mutants, their corresponding re-generated mutants and  <dig> complemented strains in rice plants by pin prick inoculation . eight of the nine tn <dig> mutants and their respective re-generated knock-outs showed similar results displaying virulence deficiency  as observed when inoculated with higher doses of bacteria in rice. whereas pfv  <dig> again displayed virulence symptoms similar to wild type strain as obtained with syringe inoculations . with respect to complementation in these experiments, the mutant pfv  <dig>  harbouring the cosmid clone carrying the corresponding wild-type locus, regained virulence completely. on the other hand the virulence assays with mutants pfv  <dig> and  <dig> harbouring cosmid clones isolated from the gene bank did not result in complementation . mutant pfv  <dig> had the tn <dig> inserted in a gene homologous to the one coding for the syringopeptin c of p. syringae pv. syringae  b728a, thus this gene is most probably involved in the biosynthesis of one of the fuscopeptins produced by pfv. peptide synthetases are very large orfs; for example in pss b728a the three syringopeptin genes sypa , sypb  and sypc  are at least 16 kb in size . the tn <dig> insertion region in mutant pfv  <dig> was found in a gene homologous to syringopeptin c of pss b728a. this homologous gene in the pfv upb <dig> draft genome sequence contained stretches of unassigned nucleotides and it is likely to be an unusually large orf. it is therefore possible that the cosmid clone used did not harbour the complete gene hence it could not complement the mutant pfv  <dig>  mutant pfv  <dig> had the tn <dig> transposon insertion in a gene encoding for a protein with significant homology to a phage tail fiber. in pfv this gene is located in a cluster of genes with phage related functions that are probably part of an operon. again, lack of complementation could be due to the cosmid clone not containing all the genetic material necessary for the complementation. another possibility for not having complemented the virulence phenotype of pfv  <dig> and pfv  <dig> could be due to multicopy allele effects of these genes which may cause instability or fitness cost. in summary, 8/ <dig> mutants identified using c. quinoa as infection model were also found affected for virulence in a similar manner in rice  when inoculated with low doses of bacteria. the same profile of virulence in rice was also obtained with independently generated mutants in the same loci as the identified virulence defective mutants; all these data further confirm the results of the genetic screen and indicate that the inactivated functions in the identified mutants are directly or indirectly associated with pfv virulence.figure  <dig>

the nine genetic loci identified in the screen and their inference in virulence
here below we describe the nine loci in which the tn <dig> insertions were located in relation to their potential role in virulence.

virulence deficient mutants pfv  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have transposon insertions in genes involved in various metabolic functions
pfv 80: the tn <dig> was localized in a gene that displays significant identity to an arsenic efflux pump protein . arsenic is a toxic metalloid and resistance to this metal has already been described in gram-positive and also in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . we do not know the exact mechanism of involvement in virulence for arsenic pump efflux protein in pfv. however, being a toxic metal, export of arsenic through this efflux protein could be essential for a proper metabolic function and survival of the bacterial cell. it is possible that the inability of the pfv mutant bacterium to expel this or a related toxic metal ion from the cytoplasm diminishes its viability in planta and thus makes it less virulent or less fit for growth in this environment compared to the wild type pfv. virulence studies in the grapevine pathogen, xylella fastidiosa and in the fire blight pathogen, erwinia amylovora, tolc mutant affected for efflux pump functions have shown their involvement in virulence and in planta fitness  <cit> . it is possible that these efflux pumps are involved in exporting heavy metals, antimicrobials or harmful plant phenolic compounds which are released as part of the plant defense response.

pfv  <dig> and pfv 270: in both mutants pfv  <dig> and pfv  <dig>  the tn <dig> was located in genes involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid arginine  <cit> . pfv  <dig> and pfv  <dig> were found mutated in an n-acetyl-γ-glutamyl-phosphate reductase gene  and n-acetylglutamate kinase gene  respectively. the two enzymes catalyze the conversion of n-acetylglutamate in n-acetylglutamate semialdehyde, via n-acetylglutamyl phosphate. specifically, n-acetylglutamate kinase encodes the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of arginine and is inhibited by the reaction product  <cit> . in order to further verify that the two isolated mutants were affected for arginine biosynthesis, an arginine auxotrophy assay was performed as described in the materials and methods section. pfv  <dig> and pfv  <dig> mutants and their respective re-generated mutants were found affected for growth on m <dig> agar plates lacking the amino acid arginine. supplementation of arginine in m <dig> agar restored the growth defect of pfv  <dig> and pfv  <dig> mutants and their respective re-generated mutants . the chemical complementation by arginine supplementation further confirmed that the two mutants affect the biosynthesis are involved in arginine biosynthesis pathway. besides having a crucial role in metabolism and growth, arginine was also shown to have a role in virulence. arginine is one of the components of ethylene biosynthesis and together with oxoglutarate, is used by the ethylene forming enzyme  to produce ethylene. mutants in efe no longer produce ethylene and were found virulence deficient in p. syringae pvs. glycinea and phaseolicola  <cit> . interestingly, a homolog of efe is present in pfv upb <dig> draft genome . arginine is also a fundamental part of the signal peptide that directs the protein to the transport system called twin-arginine translocation system. the consensus sequence of the proteins harbouring the double arginine motif, contains two arginine repeated ser/thr-arg-arg-x-phe-leu-lys. furthermore, mutants for the twin-arginine translocation system in p. syringae spp. showed reduced viability and virulence in planta  <cit> . it is therefore possible that the reduced virulence of mutants pfv  <dig> and  <dig> is caused not only by a deficiency in the metabolism of arginine but also due to a role directly related to pathogenesis via ethylene and protein transport.

pfv 480: mutant pfv  <dig> had a mutation in a gene that encodes a bi-functional protein with two enzymatic activities: sulfate adenylyltransferase and adenylylsulfate kinase. both of these activities are important in the metabolism of sulfur. the sulfate adenylyltransferase catalyzes the first intracellular reaction for the assimilation of sulfur with the use of a molecule of atp and leading to the formation of adenosine-5-phosphosulfate . this compound is pivotal for the biosynthesis pathway of amino acids that contain sulfur, namely cysteine and methionine. the adenylylsulfate kinase utilized the same substrate as aps catalyzing its conversion into 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate  using atp molecules. paps is a universal donor of the sulfate group and is used as the substrate for important enzymes such as sulfotransferase  <cit> . it is currently unknown how these enzymes crucial for the metabolism of sulfur are involved in virulence.

virulence deficient mutant pfv  <dig> is affected in type iv pili biosynthesis
the tn <dig> transposon localized in the pfv  <dig> mutant was found in type iv pilus biogenesis gene pilz encoding a protein that displayed significant identity  with pilz of other pseudomonads. the pilz protein is one of the several pil proteins that are associated with type iv pili biosynthesis. pilz is the only protein that is not part of the pili biosynthesis operon and is located as a single transcriptional unit in the genome of pseudomonads. type iv pili genes are found not only in pseudomonads but also in other gram-negative bacteria including xanthomonads and are implicated in a wide spectrum of roles including adhesion, motility, secretion and virulence. the role of pilz in the formation of type iv pili has not yet been well established. in some cases, knock-out mutants are incapable of secreting a protein which constitutes the pilus whereas in other cases pilz does not seem to be essential for the formation of the pilus and for bacterial movement  <cit> . in recent years, sequencing of several bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of a pilz domain in many proteins and has associated the function of this domain with the binding of the second-messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate  <cit> . the c-di-gmp regulates many functions including aggregation, biofilm formation, eps production, adhesion, movement and virulence  <cit> . it is possible that pilz in pfv can influence the signalling cascade mediated by c-di-gmp that could be involved in the pathogenic process.

virulence deficient mutant pfv  <dig> is most likely affected in type vi secretion machinery
tn <dig> transposon localized in pfv  <dig> mutant was found in a gene encoding a protein annotated as a phage tail fiber in pfv upb <dig>  this gene was found adjacent to other loci encoding phage related proteins; namely the phage protein u and baseplate assembly protein j . phage related functions are reported to be present in 25% of the gram-negative bacterial genomes  <cit> . these genes encode for protein components that are structurally similar to tailed bacteriophages and are possibly involved in synthesizing a specialized contractile injection system that is known as type vi secretion system . based on structural similarities, t6ss appeared as an inverted phage tail on the surface of the bacterial cell and it secretes effector proteins into the extracellular milieu or injects them directly into host cells by a puncturing mechanism  <cit> . a common evolutionary history has been proposed for the two injection machines present in bacteria and bacteriophages  <cit> . in plant associated bacteria, t6ss has been implicated in several functions including tumorigenesis in agrobacterium  <cit> , programmed cell death in the filamentous fungus neurospora crassa by pss b728a  <cit>  and virulence in pectobacterium  <cit> . interestingly, p. fuscovaginae upb <dig> possesses a t6ss . consequently the tn <dig> mutation in phage tail fiber-like protein most likely results in a non-functional t6ss secretion machinery for delivery of effector proteins in pfv upb <dig> thus affecting virulence.

virulence deficient mutant pfv  <dig> is most likely affected in phytotoxin production
in this mutant the sequence of the gene inactivated by tn <dig> displays 96% identity with the gene of p. syringae that encodes an enzyme called syringopeptin synthetase c . in p. syringae this gene is 40614 bp long and is part of a gene cluster of 73800 bp that also includes syringopeptin synthetase a  and syringopeptin synthetase b   <cit>  . the genetic organization of these loci reveals that several genes flanking this locus are conserved among other pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides  biosynthesis clusters, including two genes encoding a putative macrolide transporter maca and macb. genes encoding maca and macb have been reported in syringopeptin, syringomycin  <cit>  and entolycin biosynthesis gene clusters  <cit>  and they were also found in pfv upb <dig> . the three peptide synthetases are responsible for the biosynthesis of non-ribosomal syringopeptin, which represents one of the major virulence factors in p. syringae  <cit> . pfv produces phytotoxins which are similar to syringopeptin and are called fuscopeptins a and b  <cit> . these lipodepsipeptides show numerous structural and functional characteristics common to syringopeptin isolated from p. syringae. the distinguishing feature of the mechanism of action of these lipodepsipeptides is their ability to interact with biological membranes. the amphipathic nature of these molecules allows their insertion into the lipid bilayer, with the consequent formation of ion channels that cause the alteration of the membrane potential and in turn the loss of intracellular material  <cit> . the leakage from the host cells enriches the intercellular fluid with sucrose, amino acids, inorganic ions and other supplements that could be supporting the bacterial multiplication  <cit> . these phytotoxins are also able to play a role on disease symptoms by inducing injuries in the host plant. syringotoxin has also properties of surfactant, fungicidal action and alteration in proton gradient. the antagonistic activity is likely to increase the competitive ability of pfv against other colonizers of leaf surfaces. although in earlier studies three pfv phytotoxins were characterized biochemically, here we report that a mutant in a vital gene for the biosynthesis of at least one of them results in pfv being significantly less virulent.

virulence deficient mutant affected in hypothetical proteins 
pfv  <dig> mutant had a tn <dig> insertion localised in a gene encoding for a hypothetical protein; adjacent to this orf there is a methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene and a gene encoding a periplasmic binding protein . the spacing between the gene encoding the hypothetical protein and the next orf  is only 46 bp thus we cannot exclude that the pfv  <dig> mutant phenotype that could be associated with periplasmic binding gene located downstream in an operonic organization. mutant pfv  <dig> on the other hand, had the tn <dig> insertion localized in a gene coding for a hypothetical protein that is flanked by a gene coding for a transcriptional regulator possessing a gntr family domain on one side and by a gene encoding a hypothetical protein on the other side. the gene encoding the neighbouring hypothetical protein is 21 bp away from the gene in which tn <dig> insertion is localised hence they could be organized in operonic structure. complementation using cosmid clones resulted in the restoration of virulence for pfv  <dig> indicating that pfv  <dig> locus was responsible for causing a virulence deficiency. we did not find any information related to virulence functions for pfv  <dig> in the literature suggesting that this is a novel gene and is implicated in virulence in pfv.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the importance of pfv as an emerging pathogen worldwide, to date no major studies have been performed to understand the mechanisms of pfv pathogenicity. in  <dig> we reported the first genome sequence of a highly virulent strain upb <dig>  <cit>  and since then the genome sequence of another strain has been published  <cit>  and many more genomes will most probably be sequenced in the future. in this study, we sought to identify and characterize some of the genes involved in pfv virulence through an in planta screening of  <dig> tn <dig> mutants; nine mutants that showed virulence deficiency compared to the wild type were identified. the inactivated loci in these mutants include some metabolic functions and also some known virulence associated functions such as type iv pilus biogenesis protein pilz, t6ss machinery and syringopeptin synthetase. the results of this study highlight the fact that pfv might share features of some of its virulence mechanisms with other phytopathogens. in addition, new loci never reported as being involved in virulence and encoding for hypothetical proteins have been found. genome mining with future virulence studies will further highlight the mechanisms of virulence of this broad host range emerging phytopathogen.
