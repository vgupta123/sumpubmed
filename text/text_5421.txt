BACKGROUND
integrative conjugative elements  are self-transmissible mobile genetic elements  that play a major role in gene flow in bacterial populations  <cit> . to date,  <dig> ices have been identified  in a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . among them, the sxt/r <dig> family of ices is one of the largest and most studied ice families and currently consists of  <dig> members  <cit> . in  <dig>  sxt/r <dig> ices were first described in vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of the diarrheal disease cholerae, and in providencia rettgeri, which was isolated in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, sxt/r <dig> ices were widely found to be prevalent in the 7th pandemic isolates of v. cholerae, other environmental vibrio species and in some enterobacteriaceae species . a comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> widely distributed sxt/r <dig> ices indicated that all of these ices consist of the same syntenous and nearly identical  <dig> core genes, whereas other families of closely related mobile elements, such as lambdoid and t4-like phages, exhibit greater diversity  <cit> . thus, sxt/r <dig> ices may be a relatively recent creation of evolution  <cit> . five hotspots  and four variable regions  are interspaced into the conserved backbone of ices, and these variable dnas generally code for resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals and bacteriophage infection, toxin/antitoxin  systems or c-di-gmp synthesis , which confer hosts adaptive functions to various environments.

v. alginolyticus is ubiquitous in marine and estuarine environments and is the most common vibrio species isolated in southern coastal areas of china  <cit> . v. alginolyticus has received increasing attention because some strains are pathogenic to humans and aquatic animals and have caused huge economic losses  <cit> . in 2012– <dig>  sxt/r391-like ices in environmental v. alginolyticus strains were first discovered  <cit>  and found to occur in  <dig>  % of 192 v. alginolyticus strains  <cit> . due to the ubiquity of v. alginolyticus in marine and estuarine environments and because ices can transfer at a relatively high frequency between phylogenetically distant species , it is natural to speculate that v. alginolyticus may represent a reservoir for sxt/r391-like ices. these results also raise concerns that ices will further disseminate and thereby increase the risk of dissemination of multidrug-resistant gene clusters. however, until now no complete ice sequences in v. alginolyticus have been reported. this represents a substantial barrier in characterizing the ices of this bacterium to further address the problems mentioned above.

in this study, we acquired six ice sequences from five v. alginolyticus strains including a strain harboring two coresident ices to perform a comparative analysis of these ice genomes. this work will shed light on the characteristics of the ices in environmental vibrio species and provides new knowledge of the considerable diversity of genes and potential accessory functions encoded by the variable dna in these ices.

RESULTS

to obtain the complete sequences of six ices, high-throughput hiseq  <dig> sequencing of the genomes of v. alginolyticus strains, a <dig>  e <dig>  hn <dig>  hn <dig> and hn <dig> , was carried out. fifty-six,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds sequences were, respectively, obtained, assembled and annotated using the rast annotation pipeline  <cit> . genome annotation revealed one ice sequence in each genome of strains e <dig>  hn <dig>  hn <dig> and hn492; strain a <dig> contains two coexistent ices. the alignment and assembly of these ice-related scaffolds were manually performed using the sequences of sxt , icevchind <dig> and icevchmex <dig> as references. gap filling was carried out through pcr followed by sequencing, which yielded the complete sequences of icevala056- <dig>  icevala056- <dig>  icevale <dig>  icevalhn <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig>  all ice sequences were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers kr231688-kr <dig> and kt072768-kt <dig> table  <dig> features of the ices in vibrio alginolyticus strains

general genetic structures of the ices in v. alginolyticus
the genomes of six ices were analyzed and compared in this study . it is very rare to find two ices  coexisting in one strain . the entire length of icevala056- <dig> is  <dig>  kb, coding for  <dig> open reading frames . among them,  <dig> orfs are present in sxt and  <dig> orfs in icevflind <dig> . icevala056- <dig> contains a syntenous set of  <dig> conserved core genes in the sxt/r <dig> ices . similar to sxt, specific genes of icevala056- <dig> are inserted into five hotspots  and a vr iii region, thereby disrupting rumb . the largest variable dna insertions are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, occurring in the vr iii and hs <dig> regions, respectively. icevala056- <dig> has a size of  <dig>  kb, including  <dig> orfs . of the  <dig> orfs,  <dig> are present in sxt, icevchmex <dig> or icevchban <dig> , respectively. the largest variable dnas  are inserted into hs <dig> and hs <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> structural comparison between sxt and six ices from v. alginolyticus. a schematic representation of the  <dig> core genes of sxt/r <dig> ices. left lower part is the normal int/xis module of sxt/r <dig> ices, and the upper left part shows the alternative int/xis modules of icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig>  atypical insertions of orfs of these ices and an extra copy of exo gene  of icevala056- <dig> are indicated with fold-down arrows. the absences of s <dig> and s <dig> in icevale0601/icevalhn <dig> are shown with red crosses. b variable ice regions are shown with colors according to the elements in which they were originally described: sxt , icevala056- <dig> , icevala056- <dig> , icevale0601/icevalhn <dig> , icevalhn <dig>  and icevalhn <dig> . thin arrows indicate the sites of insertion for each vr region  and hs1–hs <dig> represent hotspots 1– <dig>  some notable genes in these regions are marked. tm, trimethoprim cassette; cm, chloramphenicol cassette; sm, streptomycin cassette; su, sulfamethoxazole cassette; mosat, toxin-antitoxin system; prrabcd, an novel operon including a rm system and anticodon nuclease gene. variable region iii is shown at the top of the backbone of sxt/r <dig> ices for saving space



a sequence analysis showed only  <dig> variable bases dispersed between icevale <dig>  and icevalhn <dig>  and that all of the genes of icevale <dig> code amino acid sequences that are identical with the counterparts in icevalhn <dig>  therefore, icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> were treated as the same ice. each of icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> contains  <dig> open orfs . among them,  <dig> orfs are present in sxt or icevchind <dig>  variable dnas of icevale <dig> or icevalhn <dig> are  <dig>  kb in length, which are distributed between five hotspots  and vr i . the largest insertions of variable dnas are  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, occurring in the hs <dig> and hs <dig> regions, respectively.

icevalhn <dig>  includes  <dig> orfs , of which  <dig> and  <dig> orfs are present in sxt and icevchicdc- <dig>  respectively. variable dnas of icevalhn <dig> with a total size of  <dig>  kb are distributed in five hs regions and the vr i region. the largest variable dnas are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb and are located in the hs <dig> and hs <dig> regions, respectively. icevalhn <dig>  contains  <dig> orfs , of which  <dig> and  <dig> orfs are present in sxt and icevchban <dig>  respectively. variable dnas of icevalhn <dig> have a total size of  <dig>  kb, which are distributed in five hs regions. the largest variable dnas are  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, occurring in the hs <dig> and hs <dig> regions, respectively.

core genes of the ices from v. alginolyticus
icevala056- <dig> contains a syntenous set of  <dig> conserved core genes in the sxt/r <dig> ices , which are responsible for machinery involved in conjugative transfer, integration/excision and their regulation. either icevale <dig> or icevalhn <dig> contain  <dig> out of  <dig> conserved core genes in the sxt/r <dig> ices  . s <dig> and s <dig> from icevala056- <dig>  icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> have low identity values  with their counterparts from sxt. icevala056- <dig>  icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> integrate into the 5′ end of the host’s prfc gene targeted by sxt/r <dig> ices  <cit> , and their int and xis share at least 97 % identity with their counterparts from sxt.

icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> integrate into 3′ end of the trna-ser gene . this locus was reported to be most commonly targeted by genomic islands or by icevchban <dig> from a clinical non-toxigenic isolate v. cholerae o <dig> mzo- <dig>  <cit> . int and xis genes of three ices locate on the same strand, whereas int and xis genes of sxt/r <dig> ices locate on different strands. besides, the two genes lack similarity with their counterparts in the sxt/r <dig> ices. however, when the three ices are compared with icevchban <dig>  there are three obvious differences between two of the ice types:  int genes of icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> only have 90 % identity with the intban <dig> on the amino acids level, which is substantially lower than the 98 % average identity among sxt/r <dig> ices;  int followed by xis locates at the 5′ end of three ices, whereas int and xis of icevchban <dig> locate at the 3′ end of the ice; and  rumb genes of three ices remain intact without any insertion, but icevchban <dig> has two parts of a truncated rumb gene. blastn searches using the complete sequences of icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> as queries also indicated that the most closely related ices were icevchmex <dig>  icevchicdc- <dig> and icevchban <dig>  respectively. these sequences are members of the sxt/r <dig> ices. to provide a detailed description of the similarities and differences between the three aforementioned ices and their closely related ices, representative sxt and icevchban <dig>  whole-sequence comparisons of these ices were performed using webact  <cit> . the highly similar areas  between icevala056- <dig> and icevchmex <dig>  or between icevala056- <dig> and sxt  are substantially larger than those between icevala056- <dig> and icevchban <dig>  . similarity values between icevala056- <dig> and icevchmex <dig>  are generally higher than those between icevala056- <dig> and sxt or icevchban <dig> . three inversion areas of icevchban <dig> clearly highlight major rearrangements in it . sequence comparisons between icevalhn <dig> and sxt, icevchicdc- <dig>  or icevchban <dig> and the comparisons between icevalhn <dig> and sxt, icevchban <dig> or icevchban <dig> also exhibit similar profiles with the comparison between icevala056- <dig> and related ices . therefore, the analysis demonstrated that icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> were more similar to genuine sxt/ <dig> ices than to icevchban <dig>  with the exception of the int/xis module.fig.  <dig> alignment generated using webact for icevala056- <dig>  sxt, icevchmex <dig> and icevchban <dig>  comparisons between the regions < 80 bp are filtered. numbers show the identity values of the compared regions. red areas indicate homologous regions; blue areas indicate inversions



to further demonstrate differences in the int/xis modules contributed by icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig>  we created phylogenetic trees based on respective nucleotide sequences to clarify their evolution. trai, one of most divergent core genes in sxt/r <dig> ices  <cit> , was used as a reference gene. the trees for int and xis were extremely similar . in both trees, the ices were segregated into two evolutionarily distinct groups, whereas trai exhibited a completely different branching pattern in which all of the ices could not be clustered into different groups . in the trees for int and xis, though four ices were grouped into the same big branch, icevchban <dig> in each tree formed an independent clade that was much distant from the clade comprised of icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig>  icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> have a very similar core genetic structure; however, each has very different variable dnas , and the strains containing icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> were isolated in different time and location. further data mining in genbank using their int genes as queries indicated that v. vulnificus cladea-yb <dig>  also potentially contained a complete ice that was similar to the three ices. these results strongly suggest that the occurrence of icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> is not a rare event.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees of int , xis  and trai  genes from six ices, some randomly selected sxt/r <dig> ices and icevchban <dig>  the trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. bootstrap values were obtained after  <dig> repetitions



five ices  in this study maintain intact rumb genes without disruption by one typical transposon carrying drug-resistant cassettes. moreover, it is unusual that icevala056- <dig> contains another version of the exo gene located upstream of a standard exo gene . the two exo genes share 99 % similarity at the amino acid level.

usual gene contents of the hotspots and variable regions of the ices in v. alginolyticus
the variable genes of six ices encode a large array of functions to bestow various adaptive abilities upon their hosts . a substantial proportion of variable genes have orthologous genes and functionally related genes found in sxt/r <dig> ices, which confer functions typically found in other ices. for instances, mosa/t, hipa/b and sole higa  encode for toxin-antitoxin  systems that promote ice maintenance by killing or severely inhibiting the growth of cells that have lost the element  <cit> . many genes encode for diverse restriction-modification  systems, helicases and endonucleases. icevala056- <dig>  icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> contain the genes coding diguanylate cyclase, which are also found in icevchmex <dig>  icevflind <dig> and icevchmoz <dig>  <cit> . these genes are involved in biofilm formation, motility and virulence in several organisms  <cit> . five ices with the exception of icevala056- <dig> contain an acetyltransferase gene that is always flanked by a conserved hypothetical gene in hs <dig> , and similar genes were only found in icevchmex <dig> and r <dig>  icevala056- <dig> has a truncated copy of a drug-resistant gene cluster in vr iii region that is owned by sxt. similar truncations were also observed in other ices such as icepalban <dig> and icevchind <dig>  <cit> . when blastn was performed with the whole sequences of any variable dna regions in icevala056- <dig>  highly similar dna sequences  could be found in other ices . however, this feature is not obvious in the other five ices.

unique gene contents of the hotspots and variable regions in the ices of v. alginolyticus
with the exception of the abovementioned usual genes in hotspots and variable regions shared by other ices, six ices also contain a large number of unique genes or gene clusters that were not found in other ices . here, we only analyzed some of their notable genes. a large number of variable genes of icevala056- <dig> code for proteins that are involved in metabolism and transport. the functions of these proteins include choline uptake, the stabilization of the mscs mechano sensitive channel, calcium/sodium proton antiport and alternative metabolic pathways for oxaloacetate and citrate. a novel intact prrabcd operon-like structure is present in the hs <dig> region of icevala056- <dig> . no similar continuous structure was found in the other bacterial genomes according to a blastn search. prra, prrb and prrd code for a type i dna rm system that is similar to hsdmsr in escherichia coli  <cit> , whereas prrc codes for a putative anticodon nuclease. a related prrabcd system has been reported in e. coli ctr5x  <cit> . prra, prrb and prrc of ctr5x only share  <dig>   <dig> and 74 % similarity with their counterparts in icevala056- <dig>  respectively, whereas the prrd lacks similarity with the prrd encoded by icevala056- <dig>  overall, most of the variable genes in icevala056- <dig> could not be found in any other ices. two genes coding for transposases were found to insert in two atypical sites  .

icevale <dig> bears a large gene cluster composed of at least  <dig> genes  coding for a complex pilus assembly system. a putative threonine efflux gene and a related gene coding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase were discovered in icevale <dig>  which were predicted to contribute to amino acid transport and metabolism. a gene coding for mscs mechanosensitive channel protein and a homologous gene to yrbg coding for calcium/sodium proton antiporter occur in icevale <dig>  which were predicted to participate in the regulation of osmotic homeostasis protecting the cell from acute decreases in the osmotic environment. icevale <dig> contains two dissimilar genes that respectively encode for rna-dependent dna polymerase participating in dna replication, recombination and repair.

icevalhn <dig> includes a gene cluster composed of at least six genes. these genes code for a bacterial chemotaxis apparatus that enables the bacteria to direct their movement away from unfavorable chemical stimuli and towards favorable chemical compounds  <cit> . icevalhn <dig> contains the gene dpra and accessory gene recq. both icevalhn <dig> and icvalhn <dig> have an atypical insertion of a small hypothetical gene flanked by a transposase gene between s <dig> and s <dig> . in addition to this, icevalhn <dig> includes another atypical insertion of a gene coding dde endonuclease between eex and setc .

the largest insertion  occurs in the hs <dig> region of icevalhn <dig> and consists of  <dig> genes with various functions. the hs <dig> region contains five known genes coding for udp-glucose dehydrogenase, utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, alpha-l-rha alpha- <dig> -l- rhamnosyltransferase, glycosyl transferase and capsular polysaccharide abc transporter, respectively. all five genes are involved in the metabolism of nucleotide and carbohydrate and synthesis of capsular polysaccharide. five known genes are adjoined and dispersed by eight hypothetical genes, among which four hypothetical genes lack homologous genes in genbank. based on these features, eight hypothetical genes may be related to nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism and the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide. the hs <dig> region also includes a gene cluster comprised of five genes coding for sulfate permease, sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit  <dig>  adenylylsulfate kinase, acetyltransferase and sulfate adenylyltransferase subunit, respectively. thus, this gene cluster is likely responsible for the metabolic assimilation of sulfur from inorganic sulfate. a sole gene  is coupled by two transposase genes to form a typical transposon structure. osmc codes for organic hydroperoxide resistance protein; this gene thus likely confers its host with an alternative function to regulate oxidative stress. the genes similar to osmc have never previously been found in vibrio species.

intensive distribution of transposase genes in the ices from v. alginolyticus
notably, the ices from these v. alginolyticus strains contain abundant transposase genes , with an average of over  <dig> transposase genes per ice. a similar phenomenon was observed in other sxt/r <dig> ices, such as sxt, icevchban <dig>  icevflind <dig> and icepdaspa <dig>  the annotations for genomic scaffold sequences of five strains, a <dig>  e <dig>  hn <dig>  hn <dig> and hn <dig>  showed that they contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transposase genes, respectively. the construction of a phylogenetic tree based on the transposase genes in these ices failed because they are so highly distinct that no common sites can be found. blast searches showed that the genes closely matching these distinct transposase genes have extensive sources.

discussion
sxt/r <dig> ices widely distribute in various marine-sourced bacteria around the world  <cit> ; however, there were no records indicating the emergence of any ices in china until we confirmed the presence of sxt/r391-like ices in some v. alginolyticus strains in  <dig>  <cit> . to fully understand the features and functions of ices in v. alginolyticus, we acquired complete sequences of six ices in five randomly selected v. alginolyticus strains. strains e <dig> and hn <dig> contain extremely similar ices  that were isolated from various places  in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. similar situations have been observed in the strains containing highly similar sxtmo <dig> and icevchind <dig> and the strains containing extremely similar icevchban <dig> and icevchmoz10; however, these were isolated at distant places and in different years  <cit> . with the exception of extreme similarity between icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig>  a high genetic diversity between strains hn <dig> and e <dig> was exhibited through their genomic comparison , which indicated that they are different strains. these results strengthened the speculation by wozniak et al. that some ices have recently spread  <cit>  because they have not demonstrated obvious divergent evolution.

regarding the core genes of the six ices, icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> lack s <dig> and s <dig>  in another case, the absence of the core genes s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> in the atypical element icevchban <dig> has been observed  <cit> . additionally, s <dig> and s <dig> from these ices have relatively low identity values with their counterparts from sxt. the significant divergence of s <dig> had been analyzed; however, s <dig> has not  <cit> . beaber et al. showed that the deletion of five cores gene from rumb to s <dig>  had no detectable influence on sxt excision or transfer  <cit> . these results indicated that though most sxt/r391- or sxt/r391-related ices have the core genes s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  they are not necessary for the maintenance and transfer of ices. thus, these genes can bear more variation due to spontaneous mutations and are potentially lost during recombination events.

icevala056- <dig>  icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> integrate into the 5′ end of the host’s prfc gene targeted by sxt/r <dig> ices  <cit> , and their int and xis share at least 97 % identity with their counterparts from sxt. together with the fact that they share  <dig> other conserved core genes , these three ices are easily classified into the sxt/r <dig> family based on the strict definition of sxt/r <dig> ices  <cit> .

the classification of icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> presents difficulties because they exhibit a different int/xis module from that in sxt/r <dig> ices and because they integrate into another chromosomal site, the trna-ser gene. however, comparative genomics demonstrated that icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> were more similar to genuine sxt/ <dig> ices than to icevchban <dig> with the exception of the int/xis module. a phylogenetic analysis showed that though int and xis of icevchban <dig> were grouped into the same large branch, they formed a very independent clade in the trees of int and xis. these results clearly show that icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> form a group that is independent from icevchban <dig>  however, these three ices cannot be classed into a new ice family only based on the different int/xis module and integration site because they retain  <dig> of  <dig> conserved core genes in the same organization, which are highly similar to those in sxt/r <dig> ices . trai is one of the most divergent core genes in sxt/r <dig> ices  <cit>  and is theoretically more likely to cluster these ices into different groups; however, the opposite is true. based on these facts and other considerations, we prefer to classify icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> into an atypical group of sxt/r <dig> ices. this classification will enrich our knowledge to sxt/r <dig> ices and increase the diversity of sxt/r <dig> ices. because they are the members of an atypical group in sxt/r <dig> ices, it is interesting to speculate on how these atypical ices were generated. ices have three discrete functional modules that govern integration/excision, conjugative transfer  and regulation  <cit> . therefore, the primary int/xis module as a whole was likely replaced by the current int/xis module; primary ices could have also been replaced by sxt/r <dig> ices, leaving only int/xis modules through potential recombination. the latter appears more reasonable because three ices integrate into the trna-ser site that sxt/r <dig> ices never inserts into. inter-ice recombination was observed between tandem sxt/r <dig> ices, yielding hybrid ices with considerable frequency  <cit> . comparative genomics also supports the assertion that inter-ice recombination is commonplace  <cit> .

our results revealed that the ices analyzed in environmental strains generally retain intact rumb genes. the rumb and adjacent ruma genes encode a un repair dna polymerase and a uv repair protein, respectively  <cit> . sunlight-emitted uv light represents a major source of genotoxic stress to bacteria in the environment  <cit> ; they therefore tend to conserve ices devoid of antibiotic resistance genes by retaining a functional rumba compared with clinical strains not exposed to uv but to antibiotics  <cit> . among the six ices from v. alginolyticus, only icevala056- <dig> contains drug-resistant genes carrying a transposon. similar results were also found in another report in which only  <dig> of  <dig> environmental vibrio strains containing ices exhibited resistance to sulfamethoxazole and streptomycin, the typical resistance carried on sxt  <cit> . additionally, most drug-resistant cassettes in ices are carried by transposons, which increases the likelihood that these drug-resistant cassettes were captured after the acquisition of the ices by primary hosts. these results demonstrated that drug resistance was not a necessary function of ices, especially in environmental bacteria. however, nearly all of the ices discovered contain diverse rm systems, helicases and endonucleases, which likely protect hosts from invasion by foreign dna  and/or promote the integrity of the ice genome during its transfer between hosts  <cit> . thus, the initial biological significance of ices to hosts is to provide protection from invasion by phages and plasmids and even from dna lesions due to environmental factors.

a sequence analysis of vr and hs regions of six ices indicated that unbalanced insertions of variable dnas are very common. for instance, the hs <dig> region of icevalhn <dig> occupies 70 % of variable dnas. icevchban <dig> has a similar situation, and nearly all variable dnas are distributed in its hs <dig> region  <cit> . though five hotspots of the ices in v. alginolyticus strains have variable sizes, the insertional sizes in hs <dig> never exceed  <dig> kb and remain relatively stable. a similar phenomenon was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> typical sxt/r <dig> ices with the exception of icevflind <dig>  <cit> . regarding the contents of variable genes, the six ices also contain a larger number of variable genes that confer various functions to their hosts. here, we only discuss some unique genes discovered in these six ices. icevale <dig> bears a large gene cluster coding for a complex pilus assembly system. pili are involved in adhesion to host cells, motility and dna exchange  <cit> , and pili are often crucial virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria because they mediate attachment to and infection of target cells and are involved in evasion of the host immune system  <cit> . icevalhn <dig> contains the gene dpra, which codes for dna recombination mediator protein a. this gene is predicted to bind cooperatively to single-stranded dna  and to interact with reca  <cit> . in the process, dpra-reca-ssdna filaments are produced; these filaments catalyze the homology-dependent formation of joint molecules  <cit> . dpra is a new member of the recombination-mediator protein family and performs natural bacterial transformation . this indicates that ices not only increase the genetic diversity of their hosts in their integration but also have the ability to facilitate bacterial gene exchange via natural bacterial transformation. many alternatively metabolic pathways were discovered in six ices. as a member of bacterioplankton, v. alginolyticus widely distributes in various marine environments through ocean currents. increased metabolic pathways could potentially strengthen the fitness of v. alginolyticus in various environments.

in our study, abundant transposase genes were discovered in six ices from v. alginolyticus and other ices. transposase genes are the most abundant genes in both completely sequenced genomes and environmental metagenomes and are also the most ubiquitous in metagenomes  <cit> . previous statistics from  <dig> bacterial genomes by aziz et al. also showed that the average number of transposase genes in bacteria was  <dig> per genome  <cit> . considering this average value and the size of the ices , transposase genes may have a more intensive distribution in these ices than in any other parts of their host genomes. transposase genes encode dna-binding enzymes that catalyze ‘cut-and-paste’ or ‘copy-and-paste’ reactions to promote the integration of dna segments into new sites  <cit> . most of the described transposase genes are the core parts of transposable genetic elements , consisting of insertion sequence  elements and their resulting transposon elements , which play an important role in bacterial fitness and evolution through horizontal gene transfer . based on these analyses, these transposase genes likely integrated into the hotspots or variable regions of ices after the creation of the ices. the acquisition of tes does not always benefit hosts; tes can exhibit detrimental effects by inactivating housekeeping genes or impairing the chromosome’s structure due to transposition to unsuitable sites  <cit> . the accommodation of various tes into one relatively unimportant genomic locus exhibits fewer hazards than that into multiple dispersed loci. ices can represent an ideal target for the ‘foothold’ of these tes due to their insertional sites and containing capability. this may explain why transposase genes occur intensively in ices. ices have sophisticated transfer machinery and can transfer between genetically distant species at a relatively high frequency of 10−5-10− <dig> per donor or recipient  <cit> ; consequently, ices may serve as a carrier for tes and largely facilitate the dissemination of tes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we acquired complete sequences for six new ices in v. alginolyticus strains. a comparative genomic analysis showed that icevala056- <dig>  icevale <dig> and icevalhn <dig> are typical members of the sxt/r <dig> family. icevala056- <dig>  icevalhn <dig> and icevalhn <dig> represent an atypical group in sxt/r <dig> family. the variable genes of six ices encode a large array of functions to bestow various adaptive abilities upon their hosts. many variable genes have orthologous and functionally related genes found in sxt/r <dig> ices. six ices also contain a large number of unique genes or gene clusters that were not found in other ices. diverse transposase genes intensively occur in the ices, and ices may serve as a carrier for tes and largely facilitate the dissemination of tes.
