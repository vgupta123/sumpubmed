BACKGROUND
the trichothecene deoxynivalenol  is a secondary metabolite mainly produced by the plant pathogens fusarium graminearum and fusarium culmorum, to which human and livestock can be exposed via food and feed  <cit> . fusarium infection of wheat, barley and corn with concurrent production of don and other trichothecene mycotoxins is an increasing food safety concern worldwide  <cit> . many published papers show the toxic effects of don on animals mainly impairing immune system, health status of the gastrointestinal tract and the brain . some reports suggested that ingestion of these don may induce feed refusal, organ damage, increased disease incidence, and malabsorption of nutrients . some papers showed in the in vitro studies that don interfere with differentiation of different intestinal cell line models . in vivo, much attention has been given to the determination of glucose absorption after don exposure but only limited studies have assessed expression of nutrient transporter genes when feeding functional nutrients to alleviate poisoning triggered by a single dose of dietary don exposure . don is effectively absorbed in the upper gastro-intestinal tract , i.e. stomach, duodenum and proximal jejunum  <cit> . it is, therefore, hypothesized that don will impair absorption of nutrients including amino acid, di/tripeptides, and glucose by reducing expression of genes for transporters of these nutrients especially in the upper git. duration and amount of don exposure seem to be crucial factors for toxic effect on nutrient digestibility and absorbability as previously shown in swine and cell line models  <cit> . however, there has been no systematic investigation to date of the don-triggered effects in growth performance, serum parameters, jejunal morphology, and in the expression of nutrient transporter genes.

therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of various levels  of dietary don challenge on growth performance, serum biochemical and amino acid profile, jejunal morphology, and the differential expression of genes for nutrient transporters in growing pigs.

discussion
don is a common contaminant of cereal crops like wheat, barley, corn and oats and of high importance in food industry, and increasingly a food safety issue problem worldwide. understanding of variable don toxicology also requires the systematic combination of growth performance, serum biochemical profile, jejunal morphology, especially for the expression different nutrient transporter genes when pigs are exposed to different doses of don and coherent responses on animal or human health. considering that the gastrointestinal tract and the immune system of pigs are not vastly different that of humans, the pig can be regarded as a good model that can be applied to humans  <cit> . in the present study when pigs were fed  <dig> dose don-containing diets, especially significantly in 12 mg/kg don group compared with other  <dig> groups . consistent with previous studies examining the impact of dietary don, feed intake was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner  . this finding supports the hypothesis that the adverse effects of don contaminated diets on growth performance of growing pigs is primarily caused by depressing the voluntary feed intake .

in the present study, the relative liver weight in the 12 mg/kg don treatment group was significantly greater than that in the control , but there were no significant differences in other organs . the report demonstrated that there were no changes in organ weights with the use of don concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 3000 μg/kg  <cit> . it is not consistent with chaytor and co-workers, which analyses the effect of the combination of don and aflatoxins on the weights of internal organs, and found no changes in the weights of the liver, kidney or spleen  <cit> . the organ weights related to live weight seem to be more appropriate for interpreting the don effects. a possible explanation for discrepancies between this latter study and our present study could be that the effect of don on relative organ weights are dependent on the age of pigs, duration of exposure of pigs to don and the dose of don  <cit> .

the serum levels of alb, bun, glu, cre, alp, alt and ast were tested as a reflection of the metabolism and visceral organ status of pigs . there was no difference in alb levels, cre level and glu level between control and  <dig> don treatment groups . it is consistent with previous result showing that dietary exposure to don has no significant effect on plasma protein concentrations   <cit> , however, and it is not consistent with previous results showing that the decreased albumin levels have been found in pigs fed a don-contaminated diet  <cit> . the increase in alp in toxin control reflected the abnormal excretion of liver metabolites due to don-induced systemic toxicity, as described in a previous study  <cit> . serum ast and alt levels have been reported to be sensitive indicators of liver injury, since an increase in these values reflects leakage from injured hepatocytes  <cit> . the increase in ast and alt in the  <dig> don treatment groups compared with control indicated that this injured mechanism is triggered after don diet intake, and the result was consistent with relative live weights .

amino acids play important roles as metabolic intermediates in nutrition, immune response, and growth performance  <cit> . in the present work, we observed that concentrations of l-valine, glycine, l-serine, and l-glutamine in serum were significant decreased by the exposure to don in feedstuffs, especially significant in 12 mg/kg don group . it is not consistent with our previously reports showing that the dietary supplementation with functional nutrients in a single dose don exposure . a possible reason was the degradation of dietary valine, glycine, glutamine, and serine by the small intestine is increased by  <dig> dose don-contaminated food, resulting in their deficiencies in the animals. increasing evidence shows that these amino acids are very important for tissue protein synthesis and metabolic regulation .

antioxidant enzymes comprise a major defense system for preventing organ injury due to excessive quantities of reactive oxygen species that attack proteins, lipids, and dna, such as t-sod, hp and gsh-px  <cit> . most of the studies have demonstrated that some mycotoxins can contribute to oxidative stress in cells . in the present study, we found that the activity of t-sod, gsh-px in the pig serum was markedly decreased after exposure to don contaminated diets, indicating that don resulted in oxidative stress in the whole body . for the changes of gh and igf <dig> in our study, only igf <dig> levels were markedly decreased after exposure to don contaminated diets , which is consistent with previously reports  <cit> . a possible mechanism for the don-induced igf- <dig> suppression involves the induction of il- <dig> and other proinflammatory cytokines, which down-regulates the sensitivity of the gh receptor via suppressor of cytokines -and signal transducers and activator of transcription -related mechanisms  <cit> .

the main morphological and histological effects observed included villi flattening and shortening, apical necrosis hyperemia and a reduction in the number of goblet cells and lymphocytes . the villi height reduction indicate that don resulted in malabsorption and impairment in the jejunum. similar changes were observed during in vivo and ex vivo exposure of the intestine to don  <cit> . the toxic effects of don are mediated via the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus primarily affecting rapidly dividing cells such epithelial and immune cells  <cit> . thus, the observed villi flattening and shortening in the jejunum is probably due to the impairment of cell proliferation as as shown in the figs.  <dig>  a hyperplasia of intestinal goblet cells has been observed in piglets and broiler chicks receiving feed contaminated with  <dig> and 300 mg fb1/kg feed, respectively  <cit> . in the present study, a slightly decrease in the number of goblet cells and a increase lymphocyte cells were observed . intestinal mucus protects the epithelium against adhesion and invasion by pathogens, therefore, a increment in the number of lymphocyte cells can affect the intestinal barrier function  <cit> .

the absorption of amino acids mainly depends on their transporters on the membrane of the enterocyte  <cit> . the mrna expressions level of the b <dig> +at, glut- <dig> and asct- <dig> were no significant differences among the  <dig> groups, intestinal protein levels for these transporters need to be quantified using western blot techniques  <cit> . the eaac- <dig> is a sodium dependent glutamate transporter that can transport neutral amino acids, especially glutamate and cysteine, into intestinal vesicles  <cit> . the sglt- <dig>  which appears gradually on the apical membrane during the differentiation of enterocytes, but in mature enterocytes, the sglt- <dig> is the main sugar transport system  <cit> . in the piglet small intestine, pept- <dig> mainly transports dipeptides and tripeptides from the digestion of dietary proteins  <cit> . in addition, cat- <dig> transports cationic amino acids in the kidney and the small intestine, whereas lat- <dig> transporter is a mediator of cationic amino acid efflux from epithelial cells  <cit> . in the present study, the mrna expressions level of eaac- <dig>  sglt- <dig>  pept- <dig>  cat- <dig> and lat- <dig> in control were slightly or significantly higher than in the in the  <dig> don-containing treatment groups. the sglt- <dig> data, unlike that of glut- <dig>  in the present study was consistent with that of study of maresca et al.  <cit> . the eaac and cat- <dig> data were not consistent with our previous data obtained with a single dose of don exposure  <cit> . combined with the results of the present study and previously published data, it is clear that don can decrease absorption of glucose, amino acid and peptide by inhibiting the mrna expression of the relevant transporters . however, the mrna expression of amino acid transporters in the amino acid absorption ratio did not strictly correspond to the changes in amino acid intake  <cit> . this relationship between amino acid expression and amino acid intake in don-contaminated pigs will require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, feeding don-contaminated diets to growing pigs significantly reduced feed intake resulting in decreased growth performance. this further altered serum biochemical and amino acid profiles, jejunal morphology, and the mrna expression of nutrients transporter genes. therefore, dietary don can selectively decreased the mrna expression of nutrient transporter genes in growing pigs.
