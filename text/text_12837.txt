BACKGROUND
hard red winter wheat  is the most widely grown crop in the us great plains. hessian fly  is one of the most destructive pests that significantly reduce grain yield and end-use quality of wheat in this area and worldwide  <cit> . hessian fly is classified into biotypes of a through l, and gp. biotype gp is the prevalent biotype in fields in the great plains area  <cit> . developing resistant wheat cultivars adapted to this region is the most feasible strategy to minimize losses caused by hf.

seven  of the  <dig> resistance genes heretofore identified were reported to reside on the short arm of chromosome 1a and confer resistance against biotype gp  <cit> , and four of them  also confer resistance against hf biotype l, the most virulent and prevalent biotype in the eastern usa  <cit> . all of the seven resistance genes may be arranged as a gene cluster and are reported to exist in tetraploid t. durum or t. dicoccum or have been transferred from tetraploid wheat to hexaploid wheat  <cit> . in recent studies, efforts have been made to deploy resistance genes that exist in adapted wheat cultivars. a winter wheat cultivar ‘2174’ adapted to the southern great plains was found to have a major resistance gene on chromosome 1as  that confers approximately 70% resistance to biotype gp  <cit> . a minor qtl on the telomere region of chromosome 1as in the winter wheat cultivar ‘clark’ is also associated with resistance to biotype gp  <cit> . in addition, a minor qtl  in wheat cultivar ags  <dig> adapted to the eastern usa was reported to confer partial resistance to biotype vh <dig>  <cit> . these independent studies have pointed out that chromosome 1as is a copious resource of effective resistance to multiple biotypes, but it is not known if this region contains multiple resistance genes, or one resistance gene with multiple alleles against hessian fly, or a combination of both.

the resistance gene at qhf.osu-1a in  <dig> and its derived cultivars can be immediately utilized to control hessian fly in winter wheat improvement programs, but the qtl/gene in  <dig> explained the majority but not all of the phenotypic variation  <cit> . this qtl/gene also produces an inconsistent phenotype even under controlled environmental conditions. novel and more effective sources of hessian fly resistance in adapted genetic backgrounds are therefore urgently needed in wheat breeding programs. hard red winter wheat cultivar ‘duster’  is now widely grown in the southern great plains following its release in  <dig>  due to its versatility in grain-only and dual-purpose systems and its resilience to biotic and abiotic stress factors. duster showed the lowest fly intensities among  <dig> entries tested with moderately to heavily infested hf in the field for multiple years  <cit> . duster is one of a few wheat cultivars that confer a consistently high level of resistance to biotype gp  <cit> . moreover, hf intensities at economically significant levels have not been reported in any field plot containing this unique cultivar  <cit> . however, little is known about the genetic mechanism underlying hf resistance in duster. a diagnostic molecular marker for the resistance gene in duster is needed for effective resistance breeding.

recent progress in the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies and development of genomic mapping tools has accelerated identification of agriculturally important genes in qtl mapping experiments  <cit> . a high-throughput array to interrogate  <dig>  gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms  in worldwide accessions of hexaploid wheat including landraces and modern cultivars was developed to detect key genomic regions for wheat improvement  <cit> . the developed snp chips and maps of genetic variation have been used to identify new sources of resistance to wheat stem rust, caused by puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race group ug <dig>  with numerous studies reporting both qualitative genes and quantitative trait loci  <cit> .

more recently, next-generation sequencing  technology has provided scientists with unprecedented tools to unravel allelic variation associated with complex traits  <cit> . several approaches that combine marker discovery and genotyping have been developed, including sequencing of reduced representation libraries, restriction-site-associated dna sequencing , multiplexed shotgun sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing . increased output of the gbs data and reduced per sample cost by generating the same amount of data per sample using a 96-plex library have enabled this genotyping platform to become more attractive  <cit> . the two-enzyme gbs approach has been demonstrated to be robust for genotyping in species with a large and complex genome like barley, and even polyploid genomes like common wheat  <cit> . the development of high-density gbs markers in hexaploid wheat will facilitate the determination of the physical location of a gene of interest.

in the present work, we employed ngs technology to identify gbs snp markers across an entire genome for hf-resistance genotyping of a large wheat population. we have successfully located the gene for resistance within a region of  <dig>  cm flanked by two gbs markers. the resistance gene in duster is also located on the short arm of chromosome 1a, but it is different from the gene previously reported in  <dig>  the two genes are located  <dig>  cm apart in genetic distance. the ability to distinguish these two genes is critically important in marker-assisted breeding.

RESULTS
near immunity of duster to the hf biotype gp
hf biotype gp was used to test two winter wheat cultivars: duster and billings. two cultivars, molly  and carol , served as resistant controls, and karl  <dig>  was used as the susceptible control . like molly, duster showed complete resistance, whereas like karl  <dig>  billings showed complete susceptibility. when  <dig> was tested with the same hf biotype, this cultivar showed approximately 70% resistance  <cit> , indicating that duster produces a more consistent phenotype in response to biotype gp than  <dig> figure  <dig> 
comparative analysis of hessian fly resistance among hexaploid wheat cultivars. a). reactions of cultivars to the biotype gp were rated  for comparison of duster and billings. karl  <dig>  molly, and carol were used as controls. b). dh lines were groups based on their reactions to the biotype gp: complete resistance , partial resistance , partial susceptibility , and complete susceptibility .



the duster x billings population of  <dig> dh lines was tested for response to biotype gp. following infestation with the gp biotype,  <dig> lines showed complete resistance ,  <dig> lines showed complete susceptibility ,  <dig> lines showed intermediate resistance  , and  <dig> lines produced no data. when the subset of  <dig> intermediates was treated as susceptible and the other subset of  <dig> intermediates was treated as resistant, segregation of the dh population fit a one-gene model .

genetic mapping of gbs markers in the dh population
three gbs libraries at 96-plexing using the methods of poland et al.  <cit>  with enzymes pst i and msp i for  <dig> dh lines and  <dig> replicates of each parent. a total of  <dig>  gbs markers were eventually generated from  <dig>  snp called.

the gbs snp markers of  <dig> dh lines were analyzed after removing  <dig> lines with excessive missing data. these gbs markers were assembled into  <dig> linkage groups, forming genetic maps for the winter wheat dh population . based on the conserved locations of the gbs snp markers, these linkage groups were assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes in hexaploid wheat . total length of the  <dig> linkage groups containing the  <dig>  gbs markers was  <dig>  cm, with a marker density of  <dig>  cm per marker. detailed information for the length of each linkage group and genetic distances of the gbs markers on the whole genome is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  whereas  <dig> gbs markers were observed on chromosome 3b alone, no gbs markers could be mapped to chromosomes 4d or 6d. a total of  <dig> markers was assigned to genome a,  <dig>  markers to genome b, and only  <dig> markers to genome d. these results supported previous observations that genome d harbors the least amount of sequence diversity  <cit> .table  <dig>

although the gbs markers did not cover all chromosomes and some chromosomes were observed to have large gaps between mapped linkages, a large-effect qtl was found to account for most of the phenotypic variation in hf biotype gp reaction of the entire population. therefore, no further effort was needed to generate new markers to cover the missing chromosomes.

a single gene segregated for hf resistance in the dh population
a total of  <dig> gbs markers was assembled into linkage group  <dig> spanning  <dig>  cm in genetic distance. the chromosomal location of the linkage group was identified by using three different approaches . whereas many markers were assembled into a cluster, a  <dig>  cm gap was observed between markers gbs <dig> and gbs <dig>  which are located in the central region of the short arm of chromosome 1a . similar gaps in the same region were frequently observed in previous mapping studies  <cit> .figure  <dig>

d locus in the duster × billings dh population was mapped using  <dig> gbs markers. the physical location of the qtl on the short arm of chromosome 1a was validated by using xcfd <dig> and taopr-a <dig> markers that are highlighted in red. the gene at the qhf.osu-1a
d locus is centered in a  <dig>  cm region flanked by gbs <dig> and gbs <dig> markers that are highlighted in blue. the telomere region of chromosome 1as that is not covered by gbs markers is indicated by a chromosomal fragment with a dotted line. b). the position of the qhf.osu-1a
 <dig> locus in the  <dig> jagger ×  <dig> rils was mapped using  <dig> snp markers and  <dig> other markers. the physical location of the qtl on the short arm of chromosome 1a was validated by using taopr-a <dig> and xcfd <dig> markers that are highlighted in red. the gene at the qhf.osu-1a
 <dig> locus is centered in a small region indicated with purple and covering taopr-a <dig> and pm <dig>  the vertical dotted line indicates the logarithm of the odds  significance threshold of  <dig> . common markers taopr-a <dig> and xcfd <dig> on the two maps are aligned up to indicate their relative positions on chromosome 1as. qhf.osu-1a
d is on the proximal side of the common markers, whereas qhf.osu-1a
 <dig> is on the distal side of the common markers.



on the basis of whole-genome qtl scanning using interval mapping  analysis, the qtl for hf reaction was found in this group. the lod value at the peak position of this qtl for hf resistance was  <dig>  and this qtl alone accounted for up to 88% of the total phenotypic variation . this is consistent with our conclusion of a bimodal phenotypic distribution for hf reaction, which in this population was controlled by a single major gene. it was confirmed that the duster allele confers a resistant reaction, whereas the billings allele confers a susceptible reaction.

the intermediate phenotype in the dh population may be explained by two minor qtls . one qtl was mapped to linkage group  <dig> assigned to chromosome 4a, and this locus accounted for  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation . the other qtl was mapped to linkage group  <dig> assigned to chromosome 7a, and this locus accounted for  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation . at both loci duster contained a susceptible allele and billings contained a resistant allele. at gbs <dig> on the 4a locus, the average resistance was 44% in the dh lines carrying the duster allele but 67% in the dh lines carrying the billings allele, indicating a significant difference in hf resistance between the two alleles . at gbs <dig> on the 7a locus, the average resistance was 46% in the dh lines carrying the duster allele but 66% in the dh lines carrying the billings allele, indicating a significant difference in hf resistance between the two alleles .

validation of qhf.osu-1ad on chromosome 1as
the pcr product of a gbs marker is randomly amplified from the wheat genome; therefore, the physical location of a gbs marker is not implicit. as the present study advanced, a draft sequence of the wheat genome was recently released in the international wheat genome sequencing consortium   <cit> . the chromosome arm-based sequences  provided a powerful tool for identification of chromosomal locations of the gbs markers. while the location of each linkage group was predicated from the iwgsc sequences , the physical location of the qtl on chromosome 1a was validated by three approaches.

first, the sequence of a gbs marker under the peak of the qtl was searched in iwgsc databases to determine the chromosomal location of the linkage group. as a result, the sequences of gbs markers under the qtl peak, such as gbs  <dig>  gbs <dig>  gbs <dig>  and gbs <dig>  were found identical to sequences of the contigs from chromosome 1as. the sequences of gbs markers on the whole genome are archived in the ncbi sra . the sequences of those gbs markers under the qtl were also searched in est databases in genbank to determine if any marker hit any wheat est that has been mapped in wheat bins  <cit>  or any published genetic maps. if a marker did not hit any est, the marker sequence was used to search in wheat genome sequences to test if the marker hit any contig that contains a gene. gbs <dig> showed a match with contig <dig>  of chinese spring genomic sequences  and a cdna sequence of diploid wheat t. urartu , suggesting that the gbs <dig> marker sequence was amplified from a gene. the sequence of gbs <dig> hit a gene that has a single copy in rice chromosome  <dig>  suggesting that the gbs07859-containing linkage group was from chromosome group  <dig> in wheat.

second, ssr marker xcfd <dig> that was reported on chromosome 1as was mapped in the gbs <dig> linkage group. two ssr markers xcfd <dig> and xwmc <dig> that were mapped in chromosome group  <dig> were found to be polymorphic between the duster and billings alleles. xwmc <dig> was mapped to chromosome 1d . xcfd <dig> was mapped to chromosome 1a , further supporting that the gbs linkage group  <dig> was from chromosome 1a.figure  <dig>

d is predicted to be between gbs <dig> and gbs <dig> and indicated with a dot with red line.



lastly, a marker for the taopr-a <dig> gene that was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 1a  <cit>  was developed to identify allelic variation between duster and billings . the taopr-a <dig> gene was mapped in gbs linkage group  <dig> of the dh population, enabling us to conclude that the gbs linkage group  <dig> was located on the short arm of chromosome 1a in wheat.

the confirmed chromosomal locations of gbs <dig>  xcfd <dig>  and taopr-a <dig> altogether support the location of gbs linkage group  <dig> on the short arm of chromosome 1a in wheat. this qtl in duster was thus named qhf.osu.1ad. the previous qtl mapped in  <dig>  <cit>  is renamed qhf.osu-1a <dig> 

two hf resistance genes on chromosome 1as
a total of  <dig> snp markers was assembled into chromosome 1as that was previously mapped with  <dig> ssr markers and pcr markers developed from genes including pm <dig>  taopr-a <dig>  and lox-a <dig>  <cit> . the linkage group spanned 133 cm, with  <dig>  cm per marker. the snp-saturated map resulted in qhf.osu-1a <dig> producing an lod value of  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation . mapping of both the taopr-a <dig> gene and xcfd <dig> in a set of jagger ×  <dig> rils and duster × billings dh lines allowed determination of the physical locations of the two qtls. to calculate the genetic distance between the qtls/genes, the regions containing the two qtls and their neighboring markers were enlarged and shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the two common markers xcfd <dig> and opr-a <dig> are on the distal side of the peak of qhf.osu-1ad in duster but on the proximal side of the peak of qhf.osu-1a <dig> in  <dig>  indicating that the two hf resistance genes are located in different regions of the same chromosome . xcfd <dig> at  <dig>  cm in duster was  <dig>  cm distal to the hf gene at  <dig>  cm, but xcfd <dig> at  <dig>  cm in  <dig> was  <dig>  cm proximal to the hf gene at 21 cm, indicating that the two genes reside 10 cm apart. similarly, opr-a <dig> at  <dig>  cm was  <dig>  cm distal to the hf gene in duster, but opr-a <dig> at  <dig>  cm was  <dig>  cm proximal to the hf gene in  <dig>  suggesting that the two genes reside  <dig>  cm apart. putting the genetic distances of the two common markers together with the genes in the two different mapping populations, this study indicated that the two genes reside  <dig>  cm apart. the sequence of gbs <dig> representing qhf.osu-1ad was identical to its rice orthologous gene at position 516 kb of chromosome  <dig>  of rice . taopr-a <dig> representing qhf.osu-1a <dig> had a high identity to its rice orthologous gene at position  <dig>  kb on the same chromosome  <dig>  suggesting that the rice collinear regions of the gene at qhf.osu-1ad and the gene at qhf.osu-1a <dig> spanned approximately  <dig>  kb in rice.

thorough analysis of genotypes and phenotypes of the  <dig> individual dh lines showed the gene responsible for the qhf.osu.1ad locus resides between gbs <dig> and gbs <dig>  among the dh lines, two lines  showed a crossover between gbs <dig> and the gene . for example, the # <dig> line had the duster allele for gbs <dig> but the billings allele for gbs <dig>  this line was hf susceptible, as conferred by the billings allele. hence, the gene allelic form in this line is the same as gbs <dig>  similarly, four lines  had a crossover between gbs <dig> and the gene at qhf.osu-1ad . these results showed that the resistance gene at qhf.osu-1ad is located in the  <dig>  cm region flanked by gbs <dig> and gbs <dig> 

discussion
resistance genes against hf have been repeatedly mapped to the end of the short arm of chromosome 1a. the previous studies suggested that this genomic region may contain a cluster of major dominant resistance genes against multiple hf biotypes  <cit> . however, the previous studies were performed using different mapping populations, different markers, as well as different biotypes, which make it difficult to determine if a single resistance gene has multiple alleles or if several resistant genes reside on the short arm of chromosome 1a. this study demonstrates the existence of two distinct resistance genes on the short arm of chromosome 1a. the presence of the two genes in locally adapted cultivars provides more options for introgression of resistance from diverse genetic backgrounds.

four genes  on chromosome 1a were previously mapped in close linkage with ssr marker cfa <dig> at a genetic distance of less than 1 cm  <cit> . h <dig> was also linked to pm <dig> at a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm  <cit> ; h <dig> and h <dig> were located at  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm to psp <dig> in genetic distance  <cit> . cfa <dig>  pm <dig>  and psp <dig> were all mapped under the peak of the qhf.osu-1a <dig> locus observed in wheat cv.  <dig>  suggesting that the resistance gene in  <dig> could be orthologous to one or more of the previously mapped resistance genes  in tetraploid wheat. the taopr-a <dig> gene is the candidate for qhf.osu-1a <dig> in  <dig>  <cit> . however, the resistance gene in  <dig> and the resistance gene in duster are at least 10 cm apart. the gene mapped in duster is a novel one. the novel hf resistant locus in duster explained 88% of the phenotypic variation, suggesting that the resistance in the duster x billings dh population segregated according to a single gene. most dh lines in the population showed complete resistance or complete susceptibility to biotype gp, also supporting a one-gene model for the phenotypic distribution. whereas the gene in cultivar  <dig> explained the majority of the phenotypic variation  <cit> , the gene in duster produces a more consistent phenotype in response to biotype gp  <cit> .

the presence of a major gene in the dh population with nearly unambiguous segregation of hf resistance has provided an excellent population for cloning of this gene. to date,  <dig> genes have been cloned from wheat using the positional cloning strategy  <cit> , but no gene has been cloned for resistance to hf. fine collinearity at the qhf.osu-1a <dig> locus between wheat, rice, and brachypodium has indicated low collinearity of the gene order in this region among these species, and that the fine physical map for qhf.osu-1a <dig> cannot be established by using genome information from rice or brachypodium only  <cit> . the gene in duster has been delimited to a region between two gbs markers, gbs <dig> and gbs <dig>  gbs <dig> can be used as starting point for anchoring a physical contig of the wheat genomic sequences. the recently released genome sequences may provide a powerful tool in cloning qhf.osu-1ad.

gbs markers offer several advantages, including a generic sample preparation method, a highly robust genome complexity reduction strategy to facilitate de novo marker discovery across entire genomes, and a uniform bioinformatics workflow strategy to achieve genotyping goals tailored to individual species, regardless of the availability of a reference sequence  <cit> . the most distinguishing features of this technology are the ability to genotype any population structure, regardless whether parental data is included, and the ability to co-dominantly score snp markers segregating in populations  <cit> . using this new genotyping approach on biparental double haploid populations, we identified qhf.osu-1ad. the development and application of gbs markers in the dh population has provided a successful example of developing high-density markers in wheat without a sequenced genome, and for determining the physical location of a major gene without sequencing physical contigs or the whole genome in wheat.

among the  <dig> known hf resistance genes, however, only  <dig> genes  were identified in hexaploid wheat  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> genes were identified in distant and close relatives of hexaploid wheat. h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> were individually transferred from t. turgidum ssp. durum into the background of common wheat cultivars  <cit> , but these genes have not yet been deployed in commercial cultivars  <cit> . hdic was transferred to wheat germplasm ks99wgrc <dig> from an accession of cultivated emmer wheat  pi  <dig>  it is not known where the gene in  <dig> or duster originated. however, this study provides molecular marker tools to pyramid effective resistance genes in bread wheat, particularly those accessible from more adapted genetic backgrounds, to manage hessian fly and improve resistance durability in hard red winter wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
this study deployed gbs markers to rapidly and precisely map a major gene for unique resistance against hf in winter wheat cultivar duster. in comparison with the hf resistance gene in winter wheat cultivar  <dig>  the gene in duster is novel and confers a more consistent phenotype. the hf resistance gene in  <dig> is likely allelic to one or more of the previously mapped resistance genes  in wheat, but the hf resistance gene in duster is not allelic to any of these reported genes. the existence of two distinct resistance genes on the short arm of chromosome 1a in locally adapted cultivars provides more options for introgression of resistance from diverse genetic backgrounds and pyramiding of the distinct two resistance genes in a single germplasm line. the nearly unambiguous segregation of hf resistance under duster and billings genetic backgrounds has provided an excellent opportunity for cloning of the hf resistance gene in duster.
