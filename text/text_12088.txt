BACKGROUND
control of the main phenological events, berry size and aromatic composition are target traits for viticulturists and wine makers. additionally, in the table grape market there is an increasing demand for seedless varieties.

phenology is the most important attribute involved in the adaptation of grapevine, as other crops, to its growing environment and to climatic changes  <cit> . it is a complex trait, which results from the interaction of various developmental quantitative characters such as flowering, veraison and fruit ripening.

the genetic control of flowering has been extensively studied in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . on the other hand, research in woody species like grapevine is made difficult by the long juvenile or non-flowering period of seed-grown plants, by the large size of adult trees, and by the annual occurrence of flowers. despite the conservation of several flowering pathways among plants, there may be major differences in the mechanisms of flower induction in the long-day plant arabidopsis compared with most short-day plants and woody perennials. similar genes may be involved, but it is highly probable that they are regulated in a different manner or have different downstream effects than in arabidopsis. flowering in vitis vinifera differs significantly from that in arabidopsis in having distinct juvenile and adult periods during development; this process takes  <dig> years in adult grapevine plants and is mediated by a peculiar meristematic structure  at the origin of both tendrils and inflorescences  <cit> . the environmental and endogenous influences on grapevine flowering are different from those acting on arabidopsis. in arabidopsis, flowering is stimulated by gibberellins , long days and vernalization. in grapevine the variables that promote flowering are light intensity, high temperature and ga inhibitors, while vernalization and long days do not have a marked effect. although much work has been devoted to the physiology of grape flowering in order to forecast crop and to increase or decrease yield, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. in the last years the grapevine orthologs of some arabidopsis flowering genes have been cloned and characterized: vvmads <dig>  an agamous/shatterproof homologue  <cit> ; vvmads <dig> and vvmads <dig>  related to the sepellata genes, vvmads <dig>  homologous to agamous-like <dig> and  <dig>  and vvmads <dig>  homologous to agamous-like <dig>  <cit> ; vfl, the homologue of leafy  <cit> ; vap <dig> and vful-l, respectively homologous to apetala <dig> and fruitfull-like  <cit> ; vvtfl <dig>  the homologue of terminal flower <dig>  <cit> ; vvft and vvmads <dig>  respectively homologous to flowering time and suppressor of overexpression of constans <dig>  <cit> ; vvmft, the homologue of mother of ft and tfl <dig>  <cit> .

unique features characterize also the process of fruit development in grapevine. fruit ripening is a highly programmed event relying on the coordinated activation of numerous genes mainly controlling cell-wall composition, sugar and water import, organic acid metabolism and storage, anthocyanin synthesis and response towards biotic or abiotic stress  <cit> .

two kinds of seedlessness exist in grapevine  <cit> : parthenocarpy  and stenospermocarpy . parthenocarpic fruits are seedless because the ovary is able to develop without ovule fertilization, thanks to the stimulus of pollination. the small size of berries from parthenocarpic grapes makes them suitable only for the production of raisins. in stenospermocarpic varieties pollination and fertilization occur as normal, but the embryo and/or endosperm abort two to four weeks after fertilization; as a result, seed development ceases , while the ovary wall pericarp continues to grow and originates berries which still have a size compatible with commercial requirements for fresh fruit consumption. different hypothesis have been proposed for the genetic control of seedlessness  <cit> , the predominant one suggesting the involvement of three independent and complementary recessive genes regulated by a dominant gene, later named sdi   <cit> , which inhibits seed development. recently differential expression analysis between a seeded and a seedless thompson line identified a gene coding for the chloroplast chaperonin  <dig> , whose silencing in tobacco and tomato fruits resulted in seed abortion  <cit> . the authors concluded that the ch-cpn <dig> protein is essential for grape seed development.

in grapevine an undesired negative correlation exists between seedlessness and berry size  <cit> , since seed tissues supply important hormones for fruit development  <cit> . however additional mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of berry size. the monogenic fleshless berry  mutation in vitis vinifera l. cv ugni blanc early after fertilization impairs the differentiation and division of the most vacuolated cells in the inner mesocarp that forms the flesh, resulting in a 10-fold reduction in fruit weight  <cit> . the defect is not simply a deficiency in plant growth regulator levels and does not show any obvious relationship with fertility, seed size or number.

all the above traits are under strict hormonal control. it has been suggested that grapevine flowering is regulated by the gibberellin:cytokinin balance. gibberellins inhibit inflorescence and promote tendril development  <cit> , while cytokinins can result in the production of inflorescences from tendril meristems  <cit> . also fruit ripening is likely triggered by a number of hormonal factors. despite grapes have been classified as non-climacteric fruits, evidence of a transient increment in endogenous ethylene level prior to veraison suggested that ethylene perception is required for at least the increase of berry diameter, the decrease of berry acidity and the accumulation of anthocyanins in the ripening berries  <cit> . other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscissic acid, have been proposed to control grape ripening. grape berry ripening may be initiated by the combination of a decline in auxin level coupled with an increment in abscissic acid level  <cit> . moreover, symons et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that it is associated also with a rise in endogenous brassinosteroids. finally, gibberellins are likely to take a prominent part in seedlessness  <cit> , possibly in association with other growth substances, like auxins  <cit> , or ethylene  <cit> . treatments with gibberellins, besides delaying ripening, are effective in the promotion of seedlessness in seeded grapes, the suppression of vestigial seed development in normally seedless grapes, the increase of berry and cluster size and the decrease of cluster compactness  <cit> .

the aim of this work was to investigate the genetic determinism of flowering and fruit maturation timing, berry size and seed content in grapevine. linkage maps containing microsatellite, aflp and est-based markers were developed for a table grape segregating f <dig> progeny and used to perform quantitative analysis in combination with phenotypic data collected over three years. the most significant qtls were further analyzed by exploiting the recently published pinot noir genomic sequence  <cit> .

RESULTS
markers
the number and segregation type of the markers used to generate the maps of italia and big perlon are shown in table  <dig>  the  <dig> microsatellites yielded  <dig> markers, as in  <dig> cases  segregation pattern was consistent with the presence of a null allele in italia  and re-coding was adopted. the  <dig> msei/ecori combinations provided a total number of  <dig> aflp markers . two hundred seventy-five of them were polymorphic, resulting in a polymorphism percentage comprised between  <dig> and  <dig> . fourteen aflp markers were removed because of inconsistencies in the phase chosen by joinmap, leaving a total of  <dig> loci in the final mapping data set. the scar marker scc <dig>  berry colour and seedlessness segregated 1: <dig> in the progeny. thirty-five markers derived from ests were mapped after sscp and minisequencing analysis  <cit> .

genetic maps
for the maternal map  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> aflps,  <dig> est-based markers and  <dig> scar marker  were assembled into  <dig> linkage groups spanning  <dig> cm of map distance with an average interval length of  <dig>  cm; the paternal map was established on  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> aflps,  <dig> est-based markers and  <dig> morphological markers  which were positioned on  <dig> linkage groups and covered altogether  <dig> cm with an average interval length of  <dig>  cm .

"ungrouped" markers could not be assigned to any linkage group, "unpositioned" markers could be assigned but not placed on the maps because of insufficient linkage to the other loci or location conflicts.

additional  <dig> and  <dig> markers have been attributed respectively to italia and big perlon linkage groups in the absence of a definite linear order. some loci could not be assigned to any linkage group; a possible explanation is that they are located in regions of the genome not yet covered by the present maps. for the italia map the average size of linkage groups was  <dig> cm, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cm; for the big perlon map the average size was  <dig> cm, ranging from to  <dig> to  <dig> cm. the total number of positioned markers per linkage group was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for italia and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for big perlon. marker-free regions longer than  <dig> cm were found in  <dig> italia linkage groups and  <dig> big perlon linkage groups . the consensus map consisted of  <dig> markers mapped on  <dig> linkage groups , covering  <dig> cm with an average interval length of  <dig>  cm. the average size of linkage groups was  <dig> cm, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cm; the total number of positioned markers per linkage group was between  <dig>  and  <dig> ; marker-free regions longer than  <dig> cm were found in  <dig> linkage groups . five further est-based markers, monomorphic in the italia × big perlon progeny, were analyzed in a population derived from the cross between moscato bianco and vitis riparia and then mapped for synteny , as already reported in literature  <cit> .

the major genes for berry colour and seedlessness were located as mendelian markers respectively on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> , in agreement with  <cit> .

pronounced clustering of any marker type was not evident in the parental maps. aflp marker distribution was analyzed by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient between the number of aflp markers in the linkage groups and the size of the linkage groups  <cit> . the correlation was significant , indicating that aflp markers are randomly distributed. chi-square analysis revealed a distorted segregation ratio  for  <dig> % of the markers polymorphic in italia and  <dig> % of the markers polymorphic in big perlon. this amount of distortion is comparable  to the percentages already reported for grapevine  <cit> .

the frequency of distorted alleles was faintly higher for the female parent: respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the markers segregating 1: <dig> showed segregation distortion in italia and in big perlon; among loci for which segregation distortion could be tested separately in both parents,  <dig> loci segregating 1: <dig> : <dig>  showed distorted segregation only in italia and  <dig> loci segregating 1:1: <dig>   showed distorted segregation in both parents. as already reported by other authors  <cit> , most of the distorted markers clustered together on some linkage groups . interestingly, markers with skewed segregation were reported on lg <dig> also for the crosses chardonnay × bianca  <cit>  and ramsey × riparia gloire  <cit>  and on lg <dig> in the map of autumn seedless  <cit> . only lg <dig> was unidirectional in bias , while lgs  <dig> and  <dig> were bi-directional.

marker order was generally consistent between homologs from the parental and the consensus maps, thus suggesting not too different recombination frequencies between italia and big perlon; most of the inversions present on several linkage groups occurred between closely linked markers. a simple correlation between distorted markers and rearrangements does not seem to exist as only a few small inversions may be accounted for by segregation distortion, whereas some linkage groups  have many distorted markers and no rearrangements.

when comparing our maps to five other published maps with high numbers of ssrs  <cit>  and to the first integrated map of grapevine  <cit> , complete agreement exists with respect to linkage groups, while marker order is similar but less consistent. there are discrepancies in marker order between our consensus map and  <cit>   for the linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>   for the linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>   for the linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>   for the linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and finally  <cit>   for the linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  these inconsistencies reflect the limitations inherent in the small population sizes on which the maps are based  and the statistical method used to perform linkage analysis. our map shares  <dig> microsatellites with the composite map reported in  <cit>  and shows discrepancies in marker order for the groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in most cases they are small inversions in regions where groups of loci with local order unsure at lod  <dig>  were mapped in  <cit> .

comparison of parental meiotic recombination rates
parental recombination rates were compared at  <dig> intervals between common markers, covering twelve out of nineteen linkage groups. recombination was slightly higher in italia , although not statistically significant at the  <dig>  level based on a z test . this observation is in agreement with what reported to date on the effect of sex on recombination rate in grape  <cit> . among the  <dig> pairs of linked markers for which parental recombination rates were compared, twelve showed statistically significant  differences.

recombination was higher in the maternal parent for five pairs  and higher in the paternal parent for seven pairs . the observation that among the three linkage groups with the highest number of distorted markers  only lg <dig> showed statistically significant differences in parental recombination rates seems to suggest that only in some cases differences in recombination rates may account for segregation distortion.

in conclusion, the greater length of the italia map with respect to that of big perlon is presumably due to a greater number of markers rather than to differences in the recombination rate between parents.

genome length
genome length estimates differed between paternal and maternal data sets . their average value was smaller when considering all mapped markers  with respect to that obtained when excluding all aflps , opposite to what was observed by  <cit> . however, like in  <cit> , confidence intervals were larger when excluding aflps. mean observed genome coverage with all markers was  <dig> % versus an expected coverage of  <dig> % according to  <cit>  and  <dig> % according to  <cit> , whereas mean observed genome coverage in absence of aflps was  <dig> % versus an expected coverage of  <dig> % according to  <cit>  and  <dig> % according to  <cit> .

the estimated genome sizes of italia  and big perlon  are slightly greater than those reported by  <cit> , comparable to those reported by  <cit>  and much smaller than those reported by  <cit> . this last discrepancy may be due to the size of the largest marker gap, as genome size estimations based on hulbert's equation inflate with higher maximum observed map distances .  <cit>  reported maximum distances between markers of  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, while x values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for italia and big perlon maps, respectively. observed genome coverage of italia and big perlon maps was among the highest accounted for grape.

phenotypic data
phenotypic data distributions, which are shown in figure  <dig> for year  <dig>  were very similar in the  <dig> years. a continuous variation, which is typical of quantitative traits, and a transgressive segregation were observed for all traits. the kolmogorov-smirnov test indicated departures from normality for flowering beginning, flowering end, flowering period, veraison beginning, veraison end, veraison-ripening interval and percentage of seed dry matter .

analysis of variance and kruskal-wallis test revealed a highly significant year effect  for all the traits but the interval between flowering and veraison beginning. however, spearman rank-order correlations between years turned out to be significant  for all the traits, except for flowering period . the lowest correlation was observed for flowering end date , the highest one for veraison beginning date . several associations between traits within each year were revealed by spearman rank-order correlation test. many of them concerned the component variables of the same character; nevertheless correlations between different traits were also detected : a positive correlation between veraison time  and seed weight ; a positive correlation between veraison length  and mean seed number ; a positive correlation between mean berry weight  and seed weight ; a negative correlation between mean seed number  and seed dry matter  and conversely a positive correlation between mean seed number  and mean seed fresh weight .

boldface and normal font indicate respectively correlations which are significant at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  level; ns = not significant; a = correlation significant  only in one year; b = correlation not significant in one year; c = contradictory result.

correlations observed in only one year  as well as discordant correlations over different years  were not considered reliable.

qtl analysis
qtl analysis was performed separately on the parental and consensus maps for three years .

lg = linkage group; map = map in which the qtl was identified ; peak = qtl position as estimated by the cm distance of the local lod maximum from the top of the linkage group, with 't' for top and 'b' for bottom of linkage group; nearest marker = marker nearest to the qtl position; interval = 1-lod confidence interval of qtl position in cm; # = lod peak position and confidence interval were not exactly the same in different years; lod = lod value at qtl position; lod threshold = chromosome wide lod threshold for type i error rates of 20% and 5%; %var = proportion of the total phenotypic variance explained by the qtl; kw = kruskal-wallis significance level, given by the p value . complete data are referred to  <dig> , yearly details  are given for lod scores, percentage of explained variance and kruskal-wallis significance, which represent the most variable data

phenology
ripening-related qtls were previously reported by  <cit>  on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and by  <cit>  on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  in our experiment the phenology sub-traits resulted under the control of three main regions, which are localized on lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

on lg <dig> we identified, reproducibly in the three maps and years, qtls for flowering time , veraison time , veraison period , flowering-veraison interval  and veraison-ripening interval . the 1-lod confidence interval of the qtl for flowering-veraison interval partially overlapped to the confidence interval of the qtl for veraison time, while the 1-lod confidence interval of the qtl for veraison-ripening interval partially overlapped to the confidence intervals of the qtls for flowering time  and veraison time . these results reflect the positive correlation observed between flowering-veraison interval and veraison time and the less clear relationship between veraison-ripening interval and flowering/veraison time . on the contrary, the 1-lod confidence intervals of the qtls for flowering time, veraison time and veraison period were strictly contiguous but not overlapping, thus suggesting the existence of distinct qtls.

on lg <dig> of the three maps we detected qtls for flowering time , veraison time , ripening date , flowering-veraison interval  and flowering-ripening interval . again, the contiguous but non-overlapping confidence intervals of the qtls for flowering time, veraison time and ripening date seem to suggest the existence of distinct qtls, while – not surprisingly based on the correlation observed between these traits – the qtl for flowering-veraison interval coincided with that for veraison time and the qtl for flowering-ripening interval co-localized with that for ripening date.

lg <dig> turned out to be involved only in the control of veraison, as revealed by the existence in the three maps and years of two coincident qtls for veraison time  and flowering-veraison interval .

finally, two additional qtls for flowering time, respectively explaining  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance, were found on lg <dig> in the three maps and years and one additional qtl for veraison-ripening interval, explaining  <dig> – <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance, was detected on lg <dig> in two years in the three maps.

no qtl could be identified for flowering period.

berry size and seed content
qtl detection for berry size and seed content was previously reported by  <cit>  and  <cit> . our results confirm the existence of a major effect qtl on lg <dig>  which was already found by  <cit>  ,  <cit>   and  <cit>  . the same region was identified in our paternal and consensus maps for three years and explained a great proportion of the phenotypic variance for mean berry weight , percentage of seed dry matter , mean seed fresh weight  and mean seed dry weight . as expected, it coincides with the seedlessness gene sdi. the qtls for berry size and seed content co-positioned on lg <dig>  as already observed by  <cit>  and  <cit> . unlike  <cit>  and  <cit> , we did not find any evidence for the presence of two distinct qtls on lg <dig>  besides this qtl, we detected in three years two significant regions for mean berry weight on lgs  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the paternal and consensus maps, while other authors identified – in most cases in one or two years – additional qtls on lgs  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> . our qtl on lg <dig> does not coincide with that reported by  <cit>  on the same lg.

for seed number we found one qtl on lg <dig> of the three maps in two years, which explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance. previous works reported, in addition to the major qtl on lg <dig>  qtls for this trait on lgs  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , which could be detected in no more than two seasons.

for mean seed fresh weight, in addition to the major qtl on lg <dig>  we identified qtls on lg  <dig> , lg <dig> , lg <dig>  and finally lg <dig> . other authors found qtls for this trait on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, our qtl on lg <dig> for mean seed fresh weight co-localizes with the qtl for the same trait which was detected on lg <dig> of dominga × autumn seedless map  <cit>  and our qtl for mean seed fresh and dry weight on lg <dig> likely coincides with the qtl identified on the same lg by  <cit>  for number of fully developed seeds and total fresh weight of seeds or seed traces.

for mean seed dry weight, besides the major qtl on lg <dig>  we found two additional qtls: the first on lg <dig> co-localizing with the qtls for flowering time/veraison-ripening interval/mean seed number and explaining  <dig> – <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance, the second on lg <dig> co-localizing with the qtl for mean seed fresh weight and explaining  <dig> – <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance.

discussion
in this work we developed genetic maps covering most of the genome for a vitis vinifera cross between two table grape varieties. these maps were used to carry out qtl detection for ripening time, berry size and seed content.

qtl analysis reliability
when performing interval mapping we verified that qtls had lod values higher than linkage group thresholds in more than one growing season. the use of cofactors in multiple interval mapping enabled additional qtls to be found with respect to simple interval mapping. it was particularly evident in the case of seedlessness-related traits, for which a large part of the total phenotypic variation was explained by the main qtl on lg <dig>  although mqm is expected to be more powerful, we also used the non-parametric kruskal-wallis method in order to confirm that qtls detected with interval mapping were not artefacts due to large gaps, segregation distortion or non-normal distribution of traits.

as already reported by  <cit>  and  <cit> , the qtls for berry size and seed content co-positioned on lg <dig>  co-localization of qtls for other traits was found as well. in most cases it reflected the observed correlation between subcomponents of the same character . nevertheless, we also noticed co-positioning of qtls for different traits, i. e. on lg <dig> for flowering time, mean seed number and mean seed dry weight and on lg <dig> for mean berry weight and seed weight. based on the known relationship between the gibberellins produced by seeds and berry growth, it has already been suggested that the correlation between berry weight and seedlessness subtraits observed at both phenotypic and genetic level might be due to pleiotropy rather than to tight linkage. interestingly, two qtls  have been shown to regulate berry weight without affecting seedlessness, as already reported by other authors on lg <dig>  <cit> , lg <dig>  <cit>  and lg <dig>  <cit> . these qtls, along with those specific for seed content identified on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  might allow to dissociate the unfavourable correlation between berry size and seedlessness in breeding programs. similarly, the correlation between flowering time and seedlessness traits that we observed at the genetic level on lg <dig> could be due to the known effect of gibberellins on flowering. on the contrary, the observed phenotypic correlation between veraison time and seedlessness traits was not supported at the molecular level by coincident qtls on lg <dig> as reported by  <cit> . this might indicate that the genes controlling the two traits function independently of each other, but further confirmation is needed.

general reliability of our results was supported by 1) similar findings in other segregating populations , 2) kruskal-wallis analysis, which revealed significant associations between single marker genotypes and raw phenotypic data, 3) qtl stability over  <dig> years despite a large year effect. in some cases minor qtls were detected only in a single year. this might be due to year effects and/or to genotype × year interactions or alternatively to a limited detection power because of the combination of a moderate population size with at least one major qtl responsible for most of the phenotypic variance.

marker assisted selection
some ssr markers co-localized with qtls and were significantly associated with the corresponding traits in kruskal-wallis analysis : vmc1e <dig> , vmc7f <dig> , vmc7g <dig>  and vvib <dig> . their usefulness in marker-assisted selection is worth to be tested, as already suggested by  <cit>  and  <cit>  for the markers vmc7f <dig> and vmc7g <dig> 

candidate gene approach
qtl analysis indicates regions of a genome, which contribute to trait variation. the following step is to narrow down these regions to the point where the effects can be ascribed to specific genes. to this purpose we adopted the candidate gene approach  <cit>  at two levels.

first, some "functional candidate genes" selected according to their hypothetical biological function were mapped . they encode transcriptional factors influencing flowering time and seed development  or enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellins  <cit> , which are known to inhibit floral meristem production, promote seedlessness and increase berry size in grapevine. the emf  protein has the role to prevent plants from immediately flowering after germination  <cit> . the fie  protein functions to suppress endosperm development until fertilization occurs  <cit> . the products of the fis  genes are likely to play important regulatory roles in seed development after fertilization  <cit> . finally, the gai  protein negatively regulates ga response  <cit> . association analysis revealed a relationship between maize gai homologue  polymorphisms and flowering time  <cit> .

the grapevine homologue  was found to have an effect on flower development as well  <cit> . we were able to localize onto our maps markers corresponding to fie, gai, gibberellin 20-oxidase and gibberellin 2-oxidase. emf, fis and the remaining genes involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellins could not be mapped because of lack of homologous grapevine sequences in public databases or amplification failure. the markers corresponding to fie and gibberellin 2-oxidase did not co-localize with any qtl, while the position of gai, which was mapped by synteny from the moscato bianco × vitis riparia progeny, needs to be defined more precisely in order to establish its relationship with the qtls for flowering time on lg <dig>  finally, the marker corresponding to gibberellin 20-oxidase co-localized with the qtls for veraison time and flowering-veraison interval detected on lg <dig> in the three years, but it was not significantly associated with these traits in kruskal-wallis analysis.

second, we used the publicly available genomic sequence of pinot noir  <cit>  to identify "positional candidate genes" in the proximity of the ssr markers underlying qtls . this approach could be applied to all the selected microsatellites except vvin <dig>  because of contig assembling inconsistencies. gene prediction was based both on vitis vinifera  and arabidopsis known splicing sites. a general tendency towards a greater number of smaller genes was observed when referring to arabidopsis, but in most cases results were consistent. hereafter we discuss the most interesting findings.

qtl analysis suggested an association between the microsatellite vvib <dig> and flowering time, flowering-veraison interval, mean seed number and mean seed dry weight. this marker was located in contig am <dig>  within a predicted gene for a yabby-like transcription factor. the primary function of yabby gene family members is to specify abaxial cell fate in lateral organs produced by apical and flower meristems  <cit> . in addition they have been shown to have a role in growth by promoting cell division  <cit>  and in flower formation and development by controlling floral meristem and organ identity  <cit> . finally, based on their transcriptomic analysis in the fleshless berry  mutant,  <cit>  attributed to vvyab <dig> an involvement in early morphogenesis of grapevine berry. they observed for this gene a low and non-differential expression before anthesis, a strong increase after anthesis, which reached the maximum value in the fruit.

the microsatellite vmc2h <dig> underlying the qtl for veraison-ripening interval was positioned on contig am <dig>  within a gene for a conserved hypothetical protein and, more interestingly, in the proximity of a gene  encoding a putative ripening-related vitis vinifera protein . the non-coincident position of vmc2h <dig> with this gene could explain its moderate significance in kruskal-wallis analysis.

finally, the microsatellite vmc7f <dig> was mapped  <dig>  cm far from the seedlessness gene sdi. it turned out to be associated with mean berry weight, percentage of seed dry matter, mean seed fresh weight and mean seed dry weight and was located on contig am <dig> , very close to the predicted gene for vitis vinifera mads-box protein  <dig>  it is well known that the mads-box family members have a key role in flower and fruit development. boss et al.  <cit>  analyzed the expression pattern of this and three other mads-box genes during grapevine inflorescence and berry development. based on its female flower carpel-specific expression and its homology with genes of known function, they suggested for vvmads <dig> a role in ovule and seed development.

as regards the remaining microsatellites reported in additional file  <dig>  vmc1e <dig>  was located within a gene encoding a putative protein kinase, vmc5g <dig>  within a predicted gene for a heat shock factor, whereas vmc2c <dig> , vmc4g <dig> and vmc4h <dig> could not be associated to any protein of known function. we expect that the upcoming annotation of grapevine genome will contribute to fill this lacking information.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we identified the genetic determinants of berry and phenology-related traits in a table grape cross. three main qtls on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were found to control several subtraits of ripening time, while two additional regions on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> turned out to affect only specific phenological characters. a major qtl was detected on lg <dig> for berry size and seed content, as well as minor qtls on lg  <dig>   <dig> for berry weight and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for seed number and weight. the identification of molecular markers closely associated to the main observed qtls represents a first step towards the design of a marker-assisted program for table grape improvement and encourages to test the role of some positional candidate genes in trait variation.
