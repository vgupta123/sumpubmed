BACKGROUND
food restriction is associated with reduced growth rates. if refed, various animals including fish, grow at a faster than normal rate. during this burst of growth which mainly affects muscle, an accelerated turnover takes place which is characterized by markedly increased protein synthesis relative to degradation  <cit> . the elevation of protein synthesis after feeding can be translated in terms of the cellular dynamics of muscle growth. thus, it has been shown that feeding stimulates proliferation of fish myogenic cells in vivo  <cit>  as well as in vitro  <cit> , providing a source of nuclei for myotube formation and fibre hypertrophy  <cit> . there is now evidence that muscle recovery growth results from processes of metabolic adaptation, regulated by endocrine as well as the autocrine/paracrine system notably involving igf <dig>  <cit> . with the purpose of deciphering the mechanisms involved in muscle recovery growth, some studies have also reported the expression of candidate genes such as metabolic-related genes  <cit> , dominant negative regulators of the basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor genes  <cit>  and uncoupling protein  <dig> genes  <cit>  during nutritional restriction and refeeding in rainbow trout. however, until now the genetic network which is mobilized in recovering muscle has not been exhaustively described. in this study we took advantage of high density trout cdna microarrays to assess overall gene expression and to determine which pathways are dynamically activated in recovering muscle. also we identified several genes potentially involved in the gene-specific transcriptional adaptations taking place in recovering muscle.

RESULTS
effect of refeeding on growth characteristics
the mean body weight of the trout was  <dig> g ±  <dig>  and the condition factor was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  before fasting. at the end of the 30-days fasting period the mean body weight decreased to  <dig> g ±  <dig>  and the condition factor to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the mean body weight increased to  <dig> ±  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> g ±  <dig> and the condition factor to  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post refeeding respectively.

changes in gene expression during a fasting-refeeding schedule: overview
to screen for genes involved in muscle recovery growth, we undertook a time-course analysis of transcript expression in muscle of trout fasted for one month and then refed for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days. at each time point, eight to nine fish were sampled giving in total  <dig> separate complex cdna targets that were hybridized to  <dig> microarrays . unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression patterns from all samples produced a consistent grouping of the samples according to the fish feeding conditions  . this validated the experimental design and allowed further analysis. to define those genes whose expression levels were significantly different in muscle from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days refed animals compared to muscle from fasted fish we used sam analysis  <cit> . we therefore obtained approximately  <dig> genes that were then hierarchically clustered using an average-linkage clustering  <cit> . this resulted in the formation of four major clusters of genes displaying distinct temporal profiles . a similar clustering was obtained when using the k-means clustering . the first cluster was composed of genes with peak expression in muscle from starved fish, the second included genes overexpressed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-refeeding and down-regulated at  <dig> days post-refeeding  the third was composed of genes with a later and more sustained induction   and the fourth  contained genes overexpressed only in  <dig> day refed trout muscle. these expression profiles and the clusters are available online as a browseable file  <cit> . the accession number of each spotted clones can be obtained by typing the corresponding uniq_id  in the nucleotide data base of the ncbi.

genes with peak expression in starved trout muscle 
cluster i contained approximately  <dig> genes showing high expression in the muscle of fasted fish and down-regulation after refeeding. in this cluster were notably identified two major markers of nutrient deprivation: the tuberous sclerosis component  <dig>  an inhibitor of mtor function and the translational repressor 4e-bp <dig>  the most distinctive feature of cluster i was the presence of a large repertoire of genes involved in the regulation of protein degradation . these genes participate either in the lysosomal system such as the cysteine protease cathepsins b, d and s or to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. in this latter class were several proteasome subunits, proteasome-associated proteins, ubiquitin, several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases and ubiquitin ligases. among other genes involved in proteasome-mediated degradation were several cop <dig> signalosome complex subunits, cullin- <dig> and the ariadne- <dig> protein homolog. notably we did not observe any significant up-regulation of calpains in the muscle of fasted trout. cluster i contained many genes involved in catabolic pathways and beta oxidation of fatty acids such as the short, medium and long chains of acyl-coa dehydrogenase.

genes up-regulated  <dig> to  <dig> days after refeeding 
cluster ii included approximately  <dig> genes with transient induction  <dig> to  <dig> days post refeeding. in this cluster were found more than  <dig> genes regulating mrna synthesis, processing and turnover . among them were genes encoding small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, transcription initiation factors, rna helicases of the ddx family, spliceosome-associated proteins such as the nhp2-like protein  <dig> as well as polyadenylation and export factors.

cluster ii also comprised a large set of genes involved in various aspects of translation . these genes encode translation initiation factors , elongation and peptide chain release factors, peptidyl-trna hydrolases and several aminoacyl-trna synthases. in addition to these genes, a large group  of genes whose products regulate protein folding and maturation was also found in cluster ii. among these latter were several heat shock proteins , endoplasmin, several subunits  of the chaperonin-containing complex tcp <dig> and seven peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerases encoding genes  that are known to catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl bonds in oligopeptides and various folding states of proteins

consistent with the induction of genes involved in protein biosynthesis, cluster ii included a large number of genes involved in ribosome formation. this group of genes which is presented in fig.  <dig> included structural genes encoding ribosomal proteins as well as several genes whose products regulate ribosome biogenesis among which were fibrillarin, nucleolin, brix domain-containing proteins, pua domain-containing hypothetical protein mj <dig>  rrp <dig>  bms <dig> and sas  <dig> . interestingly, in contrast to ribosomal structural genes which displayed about uniform expression during the  <dig> to  <dig> days post refeeding period, most of the genes regulating ribosome biogenesis sub-clustered together  peaking at  <dig> days post-refeeding.

in accordance with an increase in cellular biosynthesis, a large number of genes involved in mitochondrial production of atp grouped into cluster ii . among them were several genes which are components of the oxidative phosphorylation system  as well as several genes of the atp synthase complexes . along with these genes involved in energy production, we observed the induction of several genes important for mitochondrion formation or biogenesis such as tim <dig> , tom <dig> , voltage-dependant anion-selective channel protein  <dig> and  <dig> and the metalloprotease afg3-like protein  <dig>  some enzymes of the mitochondrial matrix such as pyruvate dehydrogenase isoforms and succinyl-coa ligase were also found in this cluster. consistent with a stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis the gene encoding the mitochondrial single-stranded dna-binding protein  involved in mitochondrial dna replication was also up-regulated.

cluster ii also contained several genes characteristically expressed during cell proliferation . these genes are involved in dna replication , progression through the cell cycle , chromosome condensation  or associated with proliferation .

among the most differentially regulated genes with miscellaneous functions and belonging to cluster ii, we found uridine-cytidine kinase  <dig>  various genes preventing cell apoptosis such as mcl <dig>  genes whose products mediate camp-dependant signalling such as the camp-dependent protein kinase beta catalytic subunit were also present. among the genes belonging to cluster ii with unknown functions we found c9orf <dig>  the surfeit locus protein  <dig> and  <dig> encoding genes, the genes for the hypothetical protein zk <dig>  and for the hypothetical wd-repeat protein c1a <dig>  in chromosome i.

genes up-regulated 7– <dig> days after refeeding 
cluster iii that contained approximately  <dig> genes up-regulated  <dig> to  <dig> days post refeeding was enriched in genes that encode components of the reticulum and golgi apparatus such as triadin, and exostosin- <dig>  and proteins involved in transport from the reticulum to the golgi apparatus including golgi snap receptor complex member  <dig> . numerous genes in cluster iii function in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements  and organisation of the sarcomere  . also were grouped in cluster iii several collagen genes , alpha  <dig>  alpha  <dig>  and alpha  <dig>  chains) that participate in the synthesis of the muscle extracellular matrix. among the genes of cluster iii with miscellaneous function were several ras-related proteins such as rab- <dig>  rab- <dig>  and rab-11b, several members of the glutathione s-transferase family, the bifunctional methylene tetrahydrofolate precursor and the myeloid leukaemia factor  <dig> .

genes up-regulated in the muscle of  <dig> days refed trout 
cluster iv contained fewer  genes compared to the other clusters. as observed for cluster iii, cluster iv comprised several genes regulating reticulum and golgi biogenesis and activity such as glycosyltransferases and the protein transport sec24d . a distinctive feature of cluster iv was to contain several genes encoding glycolytic enzymes . in addition, cluster iv contained several genes involved in lipid biosynthesis such as 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase precursor, ethanolamine kinase, scavenger receptor class b member  <dig> and 1-agp acyltransferase.

functional categorization of genes contained in clusters i–iv as shown by gominer algorithm
to further assess the enrichment of a particular functional class of genes in each cluster we used the gominer algorithm  <cit> . given that the go data bases that served as input for gominer did not encompass the whole of genes present in our membrane only a subset of genes contained in cluster i–iv was selected for gominer analysis. nevertheless, in agreement with the detailed identification of the genes contained in the different clusters , the gominer notably highlighted an enrichment of cluster i for genes regulating protein degradation while cluster ii was found to be enriched for genes involved in rna metabolism , ribosome biogenesis, mitochondrion, translation and protein folding . on the other hand, cluster iii was particularly found to be enriched for genes participating in actin cytoskeleton and myofibrillar organisation . this functional categorization was supported by probability values  which yielded the measure of the likelihood that a particular biological process was overrepresented in a cluster compared with that expected by random selection from the sam list.

transcriptional regulators induced during muscle recovery growth
some of the genes induced during muscle recovery growth were themselves regulators of transcription . among those present in cluster ii, were two cyclic amp-dependent transcription factors closely related to creb <dig> and to atf <dig> respectively, mef2a, sf-1/fushitarazu homolog  <dig> related protein, cell growth regulating nucleolar protein lyar, apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor aatf and an unidentified zinc finger protein encoding gene. cluster iii included mtf <dig>  the lim/homeobox protein lhx <dig>  the homeobox proteins hox-c <dig> and hox-b <dig>  the lim domain containing transcription factor lmo <dig>  the homeodomain only protein hop, a creb <dig> related protein, sox <dig> as well as four unidentified zinc finger protein encoding genes. in addition to transcriptional regulators that trigger gene-specific expression by binding to sequence of promoters, we found other genes overexpressed during muscle recovery growth which potentially control gene expression by inducing histone modifications  or dna modification .

validation of the microarray gene expression data
the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained with microarrays were tested by quantitative rt-pcr  of  <dig> selected genes belonging to different functional classes. the gene expression levels obtained by real-time pcr were normalized to that of the 18s. a good agreement was observed between microarray and q-pcr analysis  with discordant results obtained for only two genes. thus, differential expression detected by microarray analysis is highly predictive of expression levels measured with an independent methodology such as q-pcr .

discussion
in this study we used high density cdna arrays to describe the changes in gene expression during muscle recovery induced by a fasting-refeeding sequence. statistical analysis of the microarray data and transcriptional profiling led to the identification of  <dig> major temporally distinct clusters. the detailed identification of the genes contained in each cluster along with a gominer analysis showed that these clusters contained genes involved in distinct biological functions.

in agreement with the proteolytic and lypolytic responses to starvation described in mammals  <cit>  a large set of genes overexpressed in the muscle of fasted trout and down-regulated after refeeding, revealed an adaptation program that favours fatty acid oxidation and protein degradation to fuel metabolism. two pathways of proteolysis appeared to be mobilized in the muscle of fasted trout: the lysosomal system as revealed by the up-regulation of several cathepsins and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, as indicated by the overexpression of numerous components involved in its activity. on the other hand, in agreement with a previous report showing that transcripts of calpains are not changed in muscle proteolysis of gravid trout  <cit> , calpain genes were not found to be up-regulated in fasted trout muscle. overall our data are consistent with the notion that most of the accelerated proteolysis in muscle is due to an activation of the ub-proteasome pathway  <cit> . supporting an increased protein degradation relative to synthesis due to food deprivation, starved trout muscle contained high levels of the transcript for tuberous sclerosis component  <dig>  which has been shown, in mammals, to inhibit mtor a positive regulator of cell growth and proliferation  <cit> , and of the transcript encoding the translational repressor 4e-bp <dig>  which presumably reinforces the inhibition of cap-dependent translation resulting from inactivation of akt/mtor  <cit> .

most of the genes that were up-regulated during muscle recovery growth fell into three major clusters  with distinct temporal profiles and showed remarkable consistency in their functional categories. cluster ii which corresponds to the first phase of muscle recovery contained a large set of genes that stimulate cellular biosynthesis. this cluster included genes involved in transcript processing, translation or involved in ribosome production. a large number of genes was also found in this cluster that are involved in post-translational modifications of nascent proteins such as heat shock proteins, subunits of the chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide  <dig> and peptidyl-prolyl cis trans isomerases that are chaperone enzymes which alter the peptide bond between a given amino acid and a proline, changing it from the cis to the trans conformation and vice versa. interestingly, it has been previously reported in zebrafish that the heat shock protein hsp <dig> alpha not only participates in the correct protein folding but also plays a specific role in the normal process of myogenesis  <cit> . given that hyperplasia  contributes to muscle growth in fish  <cit> , it can be speculated that an elevated level of hsp  <dig> alpha in recovering muscle is at least in part related to the differentiation of neomyofibres. several genes up-regulated during muscle recovery encode protein regulating the cell cycle and mitosis. this suggests, in agreement with a previous work carried out in the antarctic fish notothenia coriiceps  <cit>  that cell proliferation is stimulated by feeding, increasing myoblast fusion into new myotubes  and providing a source of nuclei as muscle fibres increase in diameter . consistent with cell cycle progression and cellular growth, which require adjustment in mitochondrial atp production, cluster ii was found to contain several transcripts that encode proteins required for oxidative respiration and atp synthesis or involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

cluster iii contained genes associated with golgi and reticulum dynamics. the induction of these genes, most of which participate in post-translational modifications and transport of proteins, is consistent with the enhancement,  <dig> to  <dig> days post refeeding, of the protein synthesis machinery. a striking feature of cluster iii is the presence of a large set of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and sarcomeric proteins involved in contractile functions. at the same time are induced several transcripts encoding matrix compounds such as chains of the fibril forming collagen i which is the major collagen of intramuscular connective tissue in fish  <cit> . all these expressions that evoke the muscle regenerative response that follows cardiotoxin delivery in mouse  <cit>  show that myofiber and muscle remodelling occur at a late time period of muscle recovery growth. as in cluster iii, cluster iv contained genes regulating golgi and reticulum biogenesis and activity but differed by the presence of genes with a role in carbohydrate metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. the increased expression in recovering trout muscle of genes involved in glycolysis is in agreement with recent data showing that atrophying muscle of gravid trout has low levels of transcripts encoding many glycolytic enzymes  <cit> .

among the transcriptional regulators induced in recovering muscle was found mef2a. the transcription factors of the mef <dig> family bind to an a/t rich sequence present in many muscle-specific promoters and enhancers  <cit> . supporting a role of mef2a in transcription of fish contractile protein encoding genes, mef <dig> sites have been identified in carp myosin promoters  <cit>  and mef2a knockdown in zebrafish has been shown to induce a down regulation of a large set of transcripts for gene encoding contractile proteins such as troponins, myosin heavy and light chains and α-tropomyosin  <cit> . interestingly mef2a induction in recovering muscle precedes that of the sarcomeric protein encoding genes. this temporal sequence is in accordance with a function of mef2a in the burst of myofibrillar protein encoding genes activation observed during muscle compensatory growth. also were induced sox <dig>  sox <dig> and the lim-only protein gene lmo <dig>  all these genes are expressed in the fish differentiating embryonic myotome  suggesting that their expression in recovering muscle relates to the formation of new differentiating muscle fibres. also the induction of hop  in trout recovering muscle is of interest because hop has been recently reported in mammals to regulate skeletal myoblast differentiation and to play a critical role in muscle regeneration  <cit> . the induction of three cyclic amp-responsive element binding proteins  along with camp-dependent protein kinase subunits suggests a possible role of cyclic amp signalling in the recruitment of new myofibres during muscle recovery. supporting this view, it has been reported in amniotes that the camp pathway participates in the regulation of myogenesis  <cit>  involving a creb-mediated transcription  <cit>  and that atf <dig> is induced during in vitro differentiation of human skeletal myoblasts  <cit> . in addition to the induction of transcriptional regulators that exert their function at the nuclear genome level, we observed the up-regulation of the transcription factor a that is a key activator of mitochondrial transcription and a participant in mitochondrial genome replication  <cit>  several other genes up-regulated during muscle recovery growth fall within the transcriptional regulator class. these genes either have homology to known sequences, but no demonstrated function in muscle development and growth  or have no homology to any known sequence . all these genes deserve in-depth studies: it would be of interest in particular to identify their individual function in fish muscle development and growth using antisens morpholino oligonucleotides and to further characterize their gene targets. in addition to the up-regulation of transcription factors, some genes related to chromatin remodelling or dna modification also were found to be induced in recovering muscle. thus we observed the induction of the chromatin remodelling protein smyd <dig> and that of two dna  methyl transferases . smyd <dig> has been recently shown to have a major role in myofibril organisation in the zebrafish embryo  <cit> . consistent with such a function in recovering trout muscle it is interesting to note that smyd <dig> is coexpressed with genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. in relation to a function for dnmt <dig> in muscle growth, it has been reported that forced expression of dnmt <dig> in murine c2c <dig> myoblasts causing de novo methylation in the myod gene induced its expression and stimulated myogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our microarray analysis shows that genes overexpressed in recovering muscle fall into distinct groups with distinct temporal profiles which showed remarkable consistency in their functional classes. the early phase of muscle recovery was associated with dramatic transient induction of a large number of genes functionally related to rna processing, translation, maturation of proteins, ribosome biogenesis, cell proliferation and mitochondrial bioenergetics. in a later and more sustained phase several genes regulating golgi and reticulum dynamics and genes involved in muscle remodelling were induced. the generation of a database of novel genes associated with muscle recovery growth will help investigations on genes, pathways or cellular process involved in muscle growth and regeneration.
