BACKGROUND
the amount of gene expression data in the public repositories, such as ncbi gene expression omnibus   <cit>  has grown exponentially, and provides a gold mine for bioinformaticians, but has not been easily accessible by biologists and clinicians. microarrays measure the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously, and have revolutionized basic and clinical research by enabling the unbiased discovery of sets of genes whose expression is characteristic of a given cell type, treatment or disease state. since the advent of this technology more than a decade ago, we have accumulated the expression levels of essentially all genes in the genomes for more than  <dig> species, across many tested biological conditions, such as diseases, gene-knockouts, drug responses, genotype variations, and more. there is still a need for a bioinformatics resource to analyze these data and enable biologists and clinicians to easily identify all experimental conditions in which a given gene or set of genes is differentially expressed, which would be very useful in elucidating the biological functions, transcriptional regulation, drug-response and clinical implication of those genes.

before  <dig>  microarray data could only be retrieved individually from lab web sites. geo was built in  <dig> as a first generation centralized repository of microarray data to facilitate the submission, storage, and retrieval. a european counterpart, arrayexpress  <cit> , was later built by european bioinformatics institute. these databases have been tremendously successful, as evidenced by the exponential increase of deposited data. as of this writing, geo contained  <dig>  microarray samples from  <dig>  experiments across over  <dig> species using  <dig>  types of microarrays, summing over nine billion expression measurements. furthermore, the count of microarrays has been doubling or tripling every year. geo now contains expression measurements for all human genes in  <dig>  conditions, including  <dig> diseases. however, biologists lacking bioinformatics skills have difficulties using and interpreting the data in these repositories. as a result, a second generation of microarray databases was designed to select and analyze subsets of publicly-available microarrays and display these using a user friendly interface. for example, gnf symatlas  <cit>  contains expression profiles for most protein-coding genes in  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse tissues. the connectivity map  <cit>  identifies expression profiles of different cell lines after perturbation by a catalog of small molecule drugs. l2l  <cit>  manually collected  <dig> lists of genes that were differentially expressed under different stimuli enabling the comparison with any list of genes of interest to identify their underlying patterns. oncomine  <cit>  contains the manually collected and analyzed expression profiles of  <dig> cancer types from  <dig>  microarray samples in  <dig> experiments. nextbio  <cit>  manually analyzed some data from geo, arrayexpress, and stanford microarray database and delivered expression profiles for a larger number of tissues, diseases, and treatments. the creators of these databases performed a handful of experiments or manually curated a subset of experiments from public repositories, and delivered the results for some types of conditions, such as tissue expression in symatlas, drug perturbation in connectivity map and cancer profiling in oncomine. nextbio processed a large number of experiments from multiple repositories, but the data sets were still manually curated for only three types of experimental conditions, such as tissue type, disease and treatments. although very useful, these databases are relatively restricted in their applications, and there is still a need for a resource to quickly process whole data sets from repositories for all types of conditions.

we have previously developed a fully automated tool ailun  <cit>  that reannotates the complete data from geo for all types of arrays across all species. this paper describes a web server, gene change browser  that automatically reannotates and analyzes all geo data sets , performs all group versus group comparisons, identifies all experimental conditions where the expression levels of a gene or set of genes is significantly changed, and displays them graphically with statistical comparisons and sort/filter functions. it also provides access to the raw data in the original studies. we provide examples that show how well-known genes involved in stem cell pluripotency can be used as search criteria, yielding previously known and unknown conditions that alter these genes.

RESULTS
microarray data analysis
we used ailun  <cit>  to parse and reannotate  <dig>  geo data sets  spanning  <dig> microarray platforms  and  <dig> species with the latest probe-gene annotations. we performed all group versus group comparisons within each gds. for example, gds <dig>  a study of age-related neurological senescence in mice, was annotated with  <dig> experimental variables, including disease state, strain, tissue, and age. there were  <dig> groups in the disease state, resulting in  <dig> comparison: accelerated aging versus normal. there were  <dig> groups in strain, resulting in  <dig> comparisons: samp <dig> versus samp <dig>  samp <dig> versus samp <dig>  and samp <dig> versus samp <dig>  similarly, we performed  <dig> tissue comparison, hippocampus versus retina, and  <dig> age comparison,  <dig> month versus  <dig> month. comparisons were constrained on groups with  <dig> or more samples. in total, we performed  <dig>  comparisons across  <dig>  gdss, involving  <dig>  total microarrays.

for every comparison, we recorded all differentially expressed genes and their corresponding q-values with a false discovery threshold of  <dig>   using significance analysis of microarray   <cit>  in the siggenes package of bioconductor. in  <dig>  of  <dig>  comparisons, at least one gene was differentially expressed at a q-value â‰¤  <dig> . on average, each comparison contained  <dig>  differentially expressed genes and each gene was differentially expressed in  <dig> comparisons and  <dig> gdss. a lot of diseases have been studied in multiple species. to identify differentially expressed conditions across species, we considered groups of orthologous genes as defined in entrez homologene  <cit> . of  <dig>  ortholog groups in homologene, the expression of  <dig>  groups was measured in one or more comparisons, of which  <dig>  groups  showed differential expression in at least one comparison. each homologene group was on average differentially expressed in  <dig> comparisons and  <dig> gdss.

genechaser
we then developed genechaser, a web server that identifies and visualizes comparisons in which a gene or set of genes was significantly differentially expressed. we implemented two search functions, single gene search and multiple gene search. single gene search takes as input any gene identifier, such as a gene symbol or swissprot id, and returns comparisons relevant to the differential expression of that gene and optionally its orthologs. the underlying universal gene identifier table  <cit>  contains  <dig> million identifiers for  <dig>  million genes from  <dig> species, enabling us to recognize most gene identifiers, even a university clone id or image clone id.

single gene search
we performed a single gene search in all species for nanog, a key transcription factor necessary for pluripotency in embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . nanog, or one of its orthologs, was measured in  <dig>  comparisons and was differentially expressed in  <dig> of them  . the most significant change in nanog expression was 1000-fold upregulation in es cells compared to hematopoietic stem cells . within the top  <dig> studies where nanog was up-regulated by more than  <dig> fold, all except two tissue comparisons were studies of preimplantation embryonic developments in different strains of mice. these studies reveal continuously increased expression of nanog as an organism progressed from being an oocyte to having  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> cells, and finally to the blastocyst stage. the increased expression is the most significant at 8-cell stage. this clearly confirms a role for nanog in es cell development, consistent with the current understanding of embryonic development as well as recent experiments with induced pluripotent cells  <cit> .

to better understand the impact of different factors on nanog expression, we filtered the above comparisons by comparison types. currently, there are  <dig> geo-specified comparison types, including disease state, genotype/variation, strain, infection, development stage, age, time, agent, dose, tissue, cell type, cell line, metabolism, stress, growth protocol, protocol, gender, individual, isolate, shock, species, specimen, temperature, and others.

filtering revealed interesting connections between nanog expression and disease state, infection and drug-response. filtering by disease state comparison showed that nanog was significantly upregulated in abnormal sperm morphology and significantly downregulated in malaria infection . it was  <dig> -fold upregulated in the sperm cells from male with consistent and severe teratozoospermia, a condition in which less than  <dig> percent of sperm cells are morphologically normal, compared to controls . it was also significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from malaria infected patients compared to uninfected controls  and presymptomatic infected patients  . these studies suggest roles of nanog in both abnormal sperm morphology and malaria infection. these findings have not been previously reported as only a few selected genes were described in the original publications  <cit> , which is common for most microarray studies. therefore, genechaser enabled the reuse of the whole data set of deposited microarray studies, instead of a few genes described in the publications.

as expected, nanog was also significantly downregulated in various types of cancer and progression in human studies . it was  <dig> -fold downregulated in primary malignant melanoma samples  and  <dig> -fold downregulated in benign skin nevi  compared to normal skin samples . it was also significantly downregulated in metastatic prostate cancer tumors compared to benign tumors  and clinically localized tumors . it was  <dig> -fold downregulated in the plasma cells from patients with plasma cell leukemia compared to patients with premalignant conditions . the significant downregulation of nanog in multiple independent studies of various types of cancer indicated a potential role in cancer and progression, consistent with previous reports linking cancer to stem cell-like phenotypes  <cit> .

filtering by agent comparisons showed that nanog expression was significantly affected by certain drugs . for example, it was  <dig> -fold upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with gemcitabine . it was also  <dig> -fold downregulated in pbmc of malaria infected patients after treatment with chloroquine . its expression in es cells was downregulated after treatment with retinoic acid , and upregulated after treatment of dimethyl sulfoxide  . these drugs could potentially be used to regulate the expression of nanog for functional study.

multiple gene search
nanog, oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and lin <dig> were previously found to be sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . we performed a multiple gene search and found that they were all significantly differentially expressed in five mouse studies  . the most significant change was that nanog , oct <dig> , sox <dig>  and lin <dig>  were all significantly upregulated in es cells compared to hematopoietic stem cells . this confirmed their roles in es cell development.

an age comparison showed that nanog , oct <dig> , sox <dig>  and lin <dig>  were all downregulated in the gonadal somatic cells from mouse embryo at  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  days post coitum , which spans the critical period of male sex determination. the significant downregulation of all four critical es cell factors suggested a potential role of es cell differentiation in sex determination, gonad differentiation, and sexual dysgenesis syndromes, which had not been described in the original publication  <cit> .

a genotype/variation comparison showed that nanog , oct <dig> , sox <dig>  and lin <dig>  were all downregulated in stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig>  deficient mice . considering they were only  <dig> -fold downregulated after the knockout of oct <dig> in mice , these changes are still significant. this finding suggests that scd <dig> might be an upstream regulator of these four es cell factors.

these four genes were also significantly differentially expressed in  <dig> human studies  . for example, nanog , oct <dig> , sox <dig>  and lin <dig>  were all significantly downregulated in primary malignant melanoma samples compared to normal skin samples .

to further investigate the role of es cell factors in diseases, we performed another multiple gene search on nanog, oct <dig> and sox <dig> and found that they were all significantly upregulated in abnormal sperm morphology, and significantly downregulated in malaria infection and cancer in human studies . nanog , oct <dig>  and sox <dig>  were all significantly downregulated in the pbmc from malaria infected patients compared to controls . the result indicates that key regulators of pluripotency are down-regulated in the response to malarial infection.

discussion
we developed genechaser to automatically analyze all geo data sets , identify all experimental conditions in which a gene or set of genes was differentially expressed, and suggest biological functions, clinical implications, and regulators for genes of interest. we performed a single gene search for nanog and found its most significant regulation is in embryonic stem  cells compared to hematopoietic stem cells. this is consistent with our current understanding of nanog in es cell developments. we further found its potential association with abnormal sperm morphology, malaria infection and cancers. we also found four drugs that regulate the expression of nanog, which could potentially be used for its functional studies.

we also showed how a multiple gene search for nanog, oct <dig>  sox <dig> and lin <dig> confirms their most significant regulation in es cells, and suggests their roles in the sex determination. we found that stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig>  might be an upstream factor for all four es factors. we further found that nanog, oct <dig> and sox <dig> were all significantly upregulated in abnormal sperm morphology and dowregulated in malaria infection and cancer, which suggests a potential role of es cell differentiation in these diseases.

second generation microarray databases, such as gnf symatlas, connectivity map, l2l, oncomine and nextbio rely on manual curation of data. while these tools are extremely useful, they are also labor-intensive. with the advent of an automatic microarray annotation tool ailun, genechaser analyzes all geo data sets in a fully automatic way. this frees users from the limitations of manually curated data sets, and enables us to incorporate new data faster and more easily. in addition, in contrast to the small number of pre-established comparison types in the older databases, genechaser allows us to take advantage of all comparison types in geo. as a result, we were able to perform complete group versus group comparisons of all geo data sets, including numerous comparisons the original authors did not perform. these comparison types were also incorporated into genechaser's filters which enable users to quickly identify specific experimental conditions of interest. finally, we designed color bars to represent output conditions that enable easy visualization and comparison according to different characteristics, including q-value, fold change, and rank percentile.

of the second generation microarray databases, nextbio contains gene profiling for a very large number of conditions. genechaser is different from nextbio by offering a multiple gene search function, which we have shown here to be a powerful tool to identify conditions, such as the role of es cell factors in sex determination, abnormal sperm morphology, malaria infection and cancer. genechaser also analyzed all  <dig> geo-specified types of experimental conditions, while nextbio only manually curated three types of experimental conditions. for example, a search of nanog on nextbio returned  <dig> conditions, while a single gene search of nanog in genechaser returned  <dig> conditions . genechaser was also different from nextbio by providing statistical comparisons with multi-test correction  and informative color bars to compare different conditions. most importantly, the construction and update of genechaser are fully automatic, which enabled us to incorporate the data faster and easier. we are committing to refresh with the latest gene profiling database and update genechaser four times per year.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, genechaser analyzed all geo data sets in an automated way to quickly deliver gene expression profiles under  <dig>  experimental conditions across all species to the hands of biologists and clinicians without bioinformatics skills. we performed a single gene search for nanog and a multiple gene search for nanog, oct <dig>  sox <dig> and lin <dig>  confirmed their roles in embryonic stem  cell development, identified several drugs that regulate their expression, and suggested potential roles of es cell factors in sex determination, abnormal sperm morphology, malaria infection, and cancer. with the expected doubling or tripling data accumulation in geo, genechaser will quickly expand to a complete spectrum of biological and clinical conditions to elucidate biological functions, clinical implications, transcriptional regulators, and drug response for novel genes.
