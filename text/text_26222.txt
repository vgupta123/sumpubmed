BACKGROUND
cynara cardunculus  an allogamous, highly heterozygous asteraceae species, includes three taxa: the globe artichoke , the cultivated cardoon  and their common progenitor the wild cardoon   <cit> . globe artichoke contributes significantly to the mediterranean agricultural economy, and is also cultivated in south america, north africa, china and usa. over the past  <dig> years, a body of evidence has grown that plant-based foods can be effective for the alleviation of several chronic diseases, and globe artichoke in particular has been shown to produce a number of nutraceutically and pharmaceutically active compounds. extracts from both globe artichoke and cultivated cardoon have exhibited hepatoprotective, anticarcinogenic, antioxidative and antibacterial qualities, and even an inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and ldl oxidation  <cit> . finally, there is increasing interest in developing the species as an energy and oilseed crop  <cit> .

since the first linkage map produced for globe artichoke  <cit> , a number of other segregating populations have been exploited for genetic mapping, including one generated from a hybrid between a globe artichoke and a cultivated cardoon genotype  <cit>  and, more recently, one obtained by crossing globe artichoke with wild cardoon  <cit> . the recent development of a set of gene-based microsatellites  <cit>  has aided the construction of consensus genetic maps  <cit> . however, these maps remains insufficiently densely populated for trait mapping and marker assisted selection. current high throughput sequencing technology, which produces dna sequence at a rate several orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods, is effective as a platform for snp  discovery. a particularly efficient protocol, termed "restriction-site associated dna"   <cit> , in combination with the illumina genome analyzer sequencing device  <cit> , discovers snps by sequencing a large set of restriction fragments  <cit> . here we report the generation of genomic rad tags from the three c. cardunculus accessions used as the parents for two of our mapping populations. the rad tags were used to derive snp markers some of which were then validated by a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  assay. the identified snps could be useful to produce denser c. cardunculus genetic maps via high-throughput genotyping technologies. the rad sequence has also been informative for characterizing the repetitive dna component of the c. cardunculus genome, in particular allowing some inferences to be made regarding the contribution of dna methylation in inhibiting its expansion.

RESULTS
rad tag sequencing and de novo contig assembly
the sequencing of the rad libraries obtained from the three c. cardunculus accessions generated some  <dig>  million reads , corresponding to ~ <dig> gbp of sequence. as reported previously  <cit> , the distribution of reads was non-uniform across the three dna samples, with  <dig>  million reads achieved for globe artichoke,  <dig>  million for cultivated cardoon and  <dig>  million for wild cardoon. as a result, the wild cardoon variety was chosen as the basis for de novo contigs assembly. the sequence assembly pipeline  generated  <dig>  reference contigs , spanning  <dig>  mbp. the gc content of the sequence was about  <dig> %, close to that prevailing in both arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and vitis vinifera  <cit> .

as expected from the size-selection procedure used in the construction of the libraries, n <dig> was  <dig> bp and the mean contigs length was  <dig> bp . the reported contig length distribution is similar to the one described by etter et al.  <cit> , while other research  reported rad contig lengths skewed towards the longer fragments. we hypothesize these differences to be related to coverage depth obtained during sequencing, as we used for our assembly ~ <dig> m total reads, while etter et al. used ~ <dig> m reads, baxter et al. ~ <dig> m reads, and willing et al. ~ <dig> m reads. furthermore, for the generation of rad sites, we used a 6-cutter  enzyme while etter et al.  <cit>  and baxter et al.  <cit>  used sbfi, which is an 8-cutter. by targeting a reduced amount of genomic loci it's likely to gain a relative higher coverage which can promote the assembly of longer contigs. alternative assemblies  accounted for less than the 7% of the rad contig set, similarly to what reported by willing et al.  <cit> .

annotation and go categorization of contigs
the blastx search resulted in a top-hit list  of protein sequences from v. vinifera , ricinus communis , populus trichocarpa  and a. thaliana . gene ontology  terms were assigned to  <dig>  contigs . most of the failed annotations  applied to contigs lacking any blastx hit; of the remainder,  <dig> % did not pass the annotation threshold and  <dig> % resulted in no go mapping. overall,  <dig>  contigs  included at least one blastx hit with an e-value < 10e- <dig>  with  <dig>  of these  recording an e-value < 10e- <dig>  despite the genome-wide rad sampling, a noteworthy part of it may be likely represented by coding regions, since a methylation-sensitive enzyme  was used to produce the rad-tag libraries  <cit> ; notwithstanding the rather short length of the rad contigs made it difficult to distinguish between sequences representing complete genes and pseudogenes. enzyme codes were retrieved for  <dig>  contigs, defining a unique set of  <dig> putative enzymatic activities, which were mapped onto kegg reference pathways . within the repetitive dna fraction ,  <dig> % of the sequences were derived from ltr retroelements, including ty/copia-like  and gypsy-like . transposable dna element footprints accounted for a further  <dig> % of the sequence. note that this quantification of transposable element abundance could have been underestimated by the shortness of the rad tag sequences which could affect search sensitivity.

k-mer distribution analysis
with the aim to investigate whether the rad sequencing was able to provide a representative and unbiased sample of the c. cardunculus genome, we compared the k-mers spectrum with other fully sequenced genomes. moreover, we further investigated how cpg content correlate with the repetitive contents of the genome, as suggested by chor et al.  <cit> . the frequency and distribution of 10-mers among the raw sequence and the assembled wild cardoon contigs were comparable to one another . k-mers lacking cpg dinucleotides were over-represented in the more repetitive portion of the spectra , while those bearing at least one cpg produced a more left-shifted distribution . results were confirmed by negative controls through the adoption of random dinucleotides, which did not show any preferential distributions of k-mers . this outcome is consistent with the known correlation of cpg methylation with the repression of transposable elements  <cit> . a comparative study of other plant genomes showed that the v. vinifera genome has a higher frequency of zero-cpg k-mers  than that of a. thaliana , but that the fragaria vesca k-mer distribution  was rather similar to that obtained in c. cardunculus . to futher investigate these trends, cpg rates  <cit>  across the four dicot species were compared. while the cpg rate in the c. cardunculus rad dataset was  <dig> ,  <dig>  was calculated for a. thaliana,  <dig>  for v. vinifera and  <dig>  for f. vesca genomes  <cit> . furthermore, the a. thaliana genome includes a 14% presence of repetitive elements  <cit> , that in v. vinifera is 41%  <cit> , and that in f. vesca 22%  <cit> . variations in cpg rates showed to be congruent with data derived from k-mer spectra analysis, since genomes harbouring higher rates of cpg reported less repetitive k-mer populations. this suggests a key contribution of dna methylation in the inhibition of genome expansion due to repetitive element proliferation.

altogether, our data suggest that the rad procedure, despite its use of gc-rich recognition sites, has produced a random representation of the c. cardunculus genome, and shows that it represents a reliable means of assessing genome complexity.

snp calling and classification
the paired ends generated for each mapping parent were aligned based on the reference contig set. this alignment detected  <dig>  sequence variants, including  <dig>  short indels, scattered over  <dig>  contigs . the overall snp frequency was estimated to be  <dig>  per  <dig>  nucleotides, a level which is almost identical to that found in the non-coding regions of the v. vinifera genome   <cit>  and very similar to that uncovered among citrus spp. ests   <cit> . the estimation of snp frequency using such high throughput sequencing data is, however, heavily dependent both on the number of genomes sampled, and on the extent  of targeting and of genome coverage. the efficiency of snp discovery was correlated with the length of the rad tags . contigs longer than  <dig> bp were associated with a 74% probability of finding at least one snp, while this probability fell to 62% for contigs shorter than  <dig> bp. setting as a criterion the need to identify snps informative for both mapping populations reduced the dataset size to  <dig>  sequence polymorphisms distributed over  <dig>  contigs ; of these,  <dig>  were snps, and  <dig> were  <dig> or  <dig> nt indels. some 57% of the contigs contained more than one polymorphic site, and non bi-allelic variants occurred at  <dig> sites. the number of heterozygous snp loci was  <dig>  in the globe artichoke parent,  <dig>  in the cultivated cardoon and  <dig>  in the wild cardoon. the loci were classified into those expected to segregate in a 1: <dig> ratio , and those in a 1:2: <dig> ratio  . the lower number of reads generated from the globe artichoke template produced an under-representation of testcross markers, compared to the levels of informativeness observed previously for other marker types  <cit> . moreover, genetic diversity across the three taxa might be responsible for taxon-specific rad tags due to the absence of psti restriction sites. in the final dataset , the proportion of contigs including more than one informative marker was 26%.

two separated filtering criteria outcomes are reported . testcross and intercross markers evaluation was carried out exclusively on ccrad <dig>  representing snp sites having sequence information for each of the three samples analyzed.

caps markers conversion and linkage analysis
a random selection of  <dig> snps was made from the ccrad <dig> dataset in order to validate the snp calls by conversion to a caps format. these assays were then used to genotype the globe artichoke × cultivated cardoon mapping population members  <cit> . primer pairs were designed for testcross snp loci expected to segregate only within cultivated cardoon . successful amplification was obtained for all the assays, and  <dig> out of the  <dig> segregated consistently with the predicted 1: <dig> ratio . three of the assays produced not readable patterns of segregation and were discarded, while other two showed no evidence of any restriction cleavage, suggesting either a false snp call  or failure in the assay . among the  <dig> caps loci retained, none showed a significant level of segregation distortion ;  <dig> loci were distributed over ten cultivated cardoon linkage groups, one  was associated to a previously linked pairs of markers and thereby generated a new lg , and caps 14600- <dig> was linked to the previously unmapped microsatellite locus cyem- <dig> . caps loci 5983- <dig> and 20149- <dig> were most tightly linked with one another . the inclusion of these  <dig> loci generated only minor changes in locus order; some re-arrangements were induced in alt_ <dig> , alt_ <dig>  and alt_ <dig> . the mapping exercise confirmed that the rad-derived snp markers are suitable for genotyping purposes.

caps markers conversion of  <dig> rad loci randomly selected among ccrad <dig>  snp-id identifies the rad contig name and the original snp position, respectively separated by "-". reads ratio refers to the number of occurrence of a nucleotide differing from the consensus sequence. bands present only in the "altilis 41" parental line are underlined. linkage groups are reported according to the reference map of cultivated cardoon  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in crop species where the number of markers available to date is limiting, the use of high throughput sequencing to generate large numbers of genetically informative assays can make a valuable and rapid contribution to linkage mapping, and its major downstream application, marker-assisted selection. rad tag sequencing based on the illumina platform has proven to be a highly reliable and cost-effective means of snp discovery. we were able to identify thousands of putative snp markers in this way, and the majority of a random sample of  <dig> was fully validated through conversion to caps assays and linkage analysis. furthermore, the reduction in template complexity generated by the rad approach greatly facilitates its implementation in mapping-by-sequencing approaches.

a large proportion of the methylation present in dna occurs in the form of cpg dinucleotides, and there is little evidence for negative selection against these in the many genomes which have been analysed to date  <cit> . acquiring genome-wide sequence has given a glimpse of the genome complexity present in c. cardunculus. even though the rad tags represent only a sample of the genome as a whole, it was clear that there exists a relationship between the frequency of cpg dinucleotides and the level of sequence repetitiveness, consistent with the known role played by methylation in controlling genome expansion due to transposable element activity  <cit> .
