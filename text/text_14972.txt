BACKGROUND
hemin is a potent oxidant that accumulates in intracranial hematomas and may contribute to neural cell injury  <cit> . it is also the preferred substrate for heme oxygenase- <dig>  the constitutively-expressed isoform that accounts for most cns heme oxygenase  under normal conditions  <cit> . in pathologic states, ho frequently has an antioxidant effect, putatively due to the protection provided by increased cellular bilirubin, decreased heme, and up-regulation of other antioxidants  <cit> . however, in models that are relevant to cns hemorrhage, ho inhibitors have surprisingly been found to be protective  <cit> .

all ho inhibitors that are currently available have numerous non-specific actions that may complicate the interpretation of experimental results, including inhibition of nitric oxide synthase and guanyl cyclase, and modification of voltage-gated calcium currents  <cit> . some may also have a direct antioxidant effect that is unrelated to ho inhibition  <cit> . in order to investigate ho- <dig> in heme-mediated injury more specifically, we have cultured neurons and astrocytes derived from ho- <dig> knockout mice and genetically-similar wild type controls. in recent studies, we observed that astrocytes derived from mutant mice were more vulnerable to hemin  <cit> . conversely, ho- <dig> gene deletion decreased the vulnerability of neurons to hemoglobin  <cit> . neither wild type nor knockout astrocytes were injured by hemoglobin at the micromolar concentrations that are feasible in vitro. ho- <dig> gene deletion per se did not result in a compensatory increase in ho- <dig> in these cultures, and produced minimal or no change in other cellular antioxidants  <cit> .

the disparate effects of ho- <dig> gene deletion on hemin toxicity to astrocytes and hemoglobin toxicity to neurons may reflect the inability of neurons to tolerate the products of heme metabolism, i.e. iron, carbon monoxide, and bilirubin. alternatively, it may reflect the different oxidant properties of hemin and hemoglobin. although the oxidant effect of hemoglobin may be due in part to hemin release to membrane lipids  <cit> , other mechanisms may also contribute. extracellular hemoglobin undergoes autoxidation, which produces superoxide  <cit> . in addition to being an oxidant, superoxide reacts with globin amino acids in a complex fashion to generate a variety of reactive species, including thiyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . it is also noteworthy that hemoglobin is highly water soluble while hemin is quite lipophilic; their accumulation in separate cellular compartments may lead to a different pattern of site-specific oxidative damage  <cit> .

the present study was designed to test the effect of ho- <dig> gene deletion on the oxidative neuronal injury produced by extracellular hemin. we specifically tested the hypothesis that targeted deletion of the ho- <dig> gene attenuated oxidative cell injury in a primary cell culture model of hemin toxicity.

RESULTS
effect of ho- <dig> gene deletion on hemin neurotoxicity
in preliminary experiments, we observed that overnight  exposure to low micromolar concentrations of hemin consistently produced morphologic evidence of neuronal injury in wild-type cultures . this time interval was therefore used for cytotoxicity studies. consistent with prior observations in pure astrocyte cultures  <cit> , no morphologic evidence of injury was observed in the astrocyte monolayer at hemin concentrations up to  <dig> μm. in order to specifically assess neuronal injury in this study, the concentrations used were limited to this range. in wild-type cultures, cell injury as quantified by ldh release was observed at  <dig> μm hemin and then increased exponentially, to release of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of neuronal ldh at  <dig> μm . the calculated ec <dig> was  <dig>  μm. ldh release was significantly reduced in knockout cultures subjected to the same treatment. at  <dig> μm hemin, only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of ldh had been released at this time point. control experiments demonstrated that these low hemin concentrations do not interfere with the ldh assay.

cell death was also quantified by analysis of fluorescence intensity after staining cultures with propidium iodide. using this method, widespread neuronal death was also observed at 3– <dig> μm hemin in wild type cultures, and the calculated ec <dig> was  <dig>  μm. propidium staining of nuclei was significantly reduced in cultures prepared from ho- <dig> knockout mice . the maximal fluorescence was produced by exposure to  <dig> μm hemin, which was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of that observed in control sister cultures treated with nmda to kill all neurons.

effect of ho- <dig> gene deletion on markers of cell oxidation
in order to assess reactive oxygen species formation after hemin exposure, cultures were stained with  <dig> μm dihydrorhodamine  <dig> after  <dig> hour hemin exposure. this time interval was used because it preceded cell lysis, and therefore allowed cell retention of the reduced fluorophore. a marked increase in fluorescence was observed in cultures prepared from wild type mice . this signal was concentrated in neuronal cell bodies and processes. in contrast, fluorescence in cultures prepared from ho- <dig> knockout mice was minimal, and did not exceed that observed in cultures subjected to medium exchanges only.

in order to further investigate the effect of ho- <dig> gene deletion on oxidative stress produced by hemin, cells were harvested after  <dig> hour hemin exposure. protein carbonyl groups , which are markers of oxidation, were then derivatized and detected with a dinitrophenylhydrazone antibody. increased immunoreactivity was apparent in lysates of wild type cultures treated with hemin . a prominent band was present at approximately  <dig> kda, along with a higher molecular weight smear. at  <dig> μm hemin, the carbonyl signal intensity in wild type cultures was  <dig> -fold higher than in cultures exposed to culture medium only, compared with only  <dig> -fold higher in knockout cultures.

hemin neurotoxicity is attenuated by iron chelators
based on our prior observations in astrocytes and neuroblastoma cells  <cit> , we hypothesized that the toxic product produced by hemin breakdown in primary murine neurons was iron. in order to test this hypothesis, the effect of iron chelators on hemin neurotoxicity in wild type cultures was assessed. most cell death, as detected by both ldh release and pi staining, was prevented by concomitant treatment with phenanthroline, a lipid-soluble iron chelator . deferoxamine, which is water soluble, was less potent; its effect when applied at a concentration tenfold greater than that of hemin reached statistical significance only when injury was assessed by pi staining.

discussion
in prior experiments, we demonstrated that targeted deletion of the ho- <dig> gene in primary neuron/astrocyte cultures did not alter expression of ho- <dig>  and had little or no effect on other cellular antioxidants  <cit> . this simplified system therefore permits investigation of ho- <dig> without the confounding compensatory effects that have been observed in whole animal models  <cit> . we have previously reported that ho- <dig> gene deletion increased the vulnerability of astrocytes to hemin, the preferred substrate of ho, in cultures containing only astrocytes. the present study targeted neurons in mixed neuron/astrocyte cultures by using hemin concentrations that did not injure astrocytes  <cit> . in this model, the opposite was observed. ho- <dig> deletion attenuated hemin-induced ros formation and reduced levels of oxidized proteins. consistent with the oxidative nature of hemin toxicity, neuronal death was reduced in knockout cultures.

although hemin is a highly reactive pro-oxidant, its breakdown as catalyzed by the heme oxygenases generates biologically active and potentially toxic products. prior in vitro studies suggest that neurons are particularly vulnerable to these, i.e. iron, carbon monoxide, and bilirubin  <cit> . the present results suggest that when neurons are provided with an excess of ho substrate, the toxicity of breakdown products outweighs any benefit provided by hemin removal. the protective effect of iron chelators suggests that this phenomenon is at least partly due to iron neurotoxicity. inorganic iron is toxic to cultured cortical neurons, with an ec <dig> of approximately  <dig> μm  <cit> . the lower ec <dig> for hemin is not surprising, given its lipophilicity and accumulation in cell membranes  <cit> . the latter phenomenon likely accounts for the greater efficacy of phenanthroline, which unlike deferoxamine is lipophilic. deferoxamine is quite effective against hemoglobin neurotoxicity in this culture system  <cit> , suggesting that hemoglobin releases its iron either in the medium or in an aqueous cellular compartment.

the present results are consistent with observations that heme oxygenase inhibitors are protective in models of cns hemorrhage  <cit> , in contrast to the beneficial effect of ho in ischemia  <cit> . in a recent study, koeppen et al.  <cit>  observed that repeated administration of tin mesoporphyrin protected thalamic neurons from the delayed degeneration that occurred in tissue adjacent to injected autologous blood. similarly, huang et al.  <cit>  observed that tin protoporphyrin attenuated edema formation after stereotactic hemoglobin injection into the rat striatum. it is noteworthy that the number of astrocytes per neuron is significantly higher in the human brain than in rodents  <cit> . the deleterious effect of ho inhibition on heme mediated injury to astrocytes may therefore be less prominent in animal models than in clinical intracerebral hemorrhage  <cit> .

the disparate effect of ho on neurons and astrocytes exposed to extracellular hemin suggests that it may be somewhat difficult to target it effectively after cns hemorrhage. all currently available ho inhibitors inhibit both ho- <dig>  which is predominantly neuronal in vivo  <cit> , and ho- <dig>  which is induced mainly in glial cells  <cit> . the protection that these non-selective agents provide to neurons may be negated by their deleterious effect on astrocytes. further investigation is needed for the development of strategies that would permit the selective inhibition or down-regulation of ho- <dig> in neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
targeted deletion of the heme oxygenase- <dig> gene mitigates oxidative stress in cultured neurons exposed to hemin, and is cytoprotective. selective inhibition of neuronal heme oxygenase may have a beneficial effect after cns hemorrhage.
