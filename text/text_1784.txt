BACKGROUND
divalent cations are essential co-factors for polymerase catalysis and are also required for the rnase h activity of reverse transcriptase   <cit> . hiv- <dig> rt is a heterodimer consisting of p <dig> and p <dig> subunits, with the p <dig> subunit performing both the polymerase and rnase h activities  <cit> . under physiological conditions, mg2+ functions as the co-factor for both activities. in addition to mg2+, rt in vitro can use alternative divalent cations such as mn2+, cu2+, co2+ and zn2+ for polymerase activity  <cit> . these cations are important to many cellular processes and are tightly regulated. the total concentration of zn2+ in cells is ~ <dig> - <dig>  mm  <cit>  while the total concentration of mn2+ in red blood cells is ~ <dig> - 3 μm  <cit> , and co2+ in the serum is in the low μm range  <cit> . the available free concentration of all these cations is kept extremely low by cellular mechanisms  <cit> . therefore, we believe these divalent cations do not play a significant role in the hiv replication lifecycle.

however, zn2+ is a potent inhibitor of several viral polymerases  <cit>  and zn2+, in addition to mn2+, has been shown to inhibit mg2+-dependent hiv rt activity in vitro in work from our lab and others  <cit> . other groups have demonstrated that zn2+-based drugs can inhibit hiv spread in animal models  <cit> . zn2+ is an active ingredient of topical solutions under study for the treatment of hiv  <cit>  and herpes simplex, an infection that can increase hiv transmission  <cit> . zn2+ has been investigated in several past and current hiv therapeutic trials  <cit> , and is a proposed treatment for rhinovirus infections  <cit> . therefore, understanding how zn2+ and other divalent cations affect different properties of rt is potentially important for future drug development.

one of the most notable effects of alternative divalent cations on polymerases is alteration of polymerase fidelity. mn2+, co2+, and ni2+ have all been shown to dramatically decrease the fidelity of dna synthesis by several human, bacterial, and viral polymerases including hiv rt  <cit> . mn2+ and co2+ decreased the fidelity of avian myeoblastosis virus  rt and human dna polymerase i in a concentration-dependent manner  <cit> . increased error frequency in presence of mn2+ has also been observed in vitro with hiv rt  <cit> , escherichia coli dna polymerase i  <cit> , phage t <dig> dna polymerase  <cit> , dna polymerases α and β  <cit> , and taq polymerase  <cit> . most of these experiments were performed using concentrations of divalent cation higher than those required for maximal enzyme activity. however, we recently reported that physiological mg2+ concentrations, which are lower than the high concentration typically used to optimize enzyme kinetics in vitro, can increase rt fidelity  <cit> .

given the potential of zn2+-based compounds as novel drugs against hiv and the vast amount of literature on alternative cations like mn2+ and co2+ being pro-mutagenic at elevated concentrations, we wanted to investigate the fidelity of hiv rt with each of these cations. although mn2+ and co2+ were previously demonstrated to support rt catalysis, our recent publication  <cit>  was the first to show  that zn2+, a potent polymerase inhibitor, can also support polymerase catalysis  <cit> . therefore, we wanted to look more closely at how this previously untested divalent cation affects rt fidelity. a better understanding of the fidelity of rt with these alternative cations could also be important for modulating the accuracy of rt-pcr reactions. mn2+ is already being used in pcr reactions to generate random mutations  <cit> . in this report, we show that under optimal extension conditions, zn2+ increases the fidelity of rt, a previously unprecedented observation of an alternative cation for a polymerase. we also show that presumed pro-mutagenic cations, such as mn2+ and co2+, are not mutagenic with hiv rt at concentrations optimal for dntp catalysis. the potential mechanisms by which zn2+ enhance fidelity as well as the reason for the concentration-dependence of mutagenesis is discussed.

RESULTS
estimation of average and maximal extension rates of rt synthesis under the alternative divalent cations
optimal extension conditions for hiv rt with mg2+, mn2+, co2+, and zn2+ in presence of 100 μm dntps were determined on a 425 nt rna template derived from the gag-pol region of the hiv genome . optimal extension for each cation in the presence of 100 μm of each dntp was observed at the following concentrations: 2 mm mg2+,  <dig>  mm zn2+,  <dig>  mm mn2+, and  <dig>  mm co2+. since a total concentration of 400 μm total nts  was used in the assays, the free concentration of each cation for optimal extension was ~ <dig>  mm for mg2+,  <dig>  mm for zn2+,  <dig>  mm for mn2+, and  <dig>  mm for co2+. note that all  <dig> alternative cations showed maximal activity at much lower concentrations than mg2+. this suggests that these alternative cations bind more tightly to rt than the physiological cation. interestingly, we also found that cu2+ supported rt catalysis but optimum extension occurred at a much higher concentration of 3 mm . average and maximum extension rates were then calculated as described in materials and methods using the rna template used for round  <dig> synthesis of the pcr-based laczα-complementation fidelity assay. as expected, the rate of synthesis was fastest using mg2+ and slowest with zn2+ . an average extension rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nts/s and a maximal extension rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nts/s was observed with 2 mm mg2+, whereas with  <dig>  mm zn2+, extension rates were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nts/s and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nts/s, respectively. both  <dig>  mm mn2+ and  <dig>  mm co2+ decreased the average and maximal rate of extension as well .figure  <dig> time course of hiv rt synthesis on the ~760 nt rna template used in the pcr-based α-complementation assay. shown is an autoradiogram with extension of a 20 nt 5′ p- <dig> end-labeled dna primer on the rna template used for round  <dig> synthesis by hiv rt . full extension of the primer resulted in a 199 nt product. a dna ladder with nt size positions is shown on the left. concentrations of the cations and dntps are indicated above the lanes. reactions were performed for  15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, or 8 min with mg2+, mn2+, and co2+, and  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min, 15 min, 30 min, and 1 hour with zn2+. a minus enzyme control  is also shown. refer to materials and methods for details.

hiv rt shows greater fidelity with zn2+ in the pcr-based and plasmid-based laczα-complementation fidelity assays
the pcr-based assay was a modified version of an assay used previously to examine the fidelity of poliovirus 3dpol  <cit>  . the 115 nt region screened for mutations is shown in figure 2c. the assay is capable of detecting all frameshift mutations and several substitutions  in this region  <cit> . the assay essentially mimics the reverse transcription process since both rna- and dna-directed rt synthesis steps are performed. most of the possible background mutations can be accounted for by performing a control in which plasmid dna is pcr amplified to produce an insert identical to those produced in the complete assay. these inserts should comprise all error sources except the errors derived from hiv rt and t <dig> rna polymerase. an average background colony mutant frequency  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  was obtained . this corresponds to  <dig> white or faint blue colony in every ~ <dig> colonies. further details of this assay are discussed in a recent publication by our group  <cit> .figure  <dig> pcr-based laczα-complementation system used to determine the fidelity of hiv rt.  an overview of the procedure used to assess polymerase fidelity is presented. rna is represented by broken lines and dna is represented by solid line. primers have arrowheads at the 3′ end. the ~760 nt template rna used as the initial template for hiv rt rna-directed dna synthesis is shown at the top with the 3′ and 5′ ends indicated. the positions of pvuii and ecori restriction sites are indicated for reference to the vector. the filled box at the bottom of the figure is the  <dig> base region of the laczα gene that was scored in the assay. details for specific steps are provided under materials and methods.  plasmid pbsm13Δpvuii <dig>  is shown. relevant sites on the plasmid are indicated and numbering is based on the parent plasmid ).  the nt and amino acid sequence for the  <dig> base region of the laczα gene that was scored in the assay is shown. both strands of the dna plasmid are shown since hiv rt synthesis was performed in both directions . a line is drawn above the  <dig> nts that are in the detectable area for substitution mutations while frameshifts can be detected over the entire 115 nt region. based on a previous cataloging of mutations in this gene  <cit> , the assay can detect  <dig> different substitutions  and 100% of the frameshift mutations.

using 2 mm mg2+, a cmf value of  <dig>   was obtained after background subtraction . results using co2+ were similar to mg2+ while zn2+ increased fidelity about  <dig> -fold . although co2+ is reported to be mutagenic, its effect on the mutation rate of polymerases is concentration-dependent  <cit> . for example, the error frequency of avian myeloblastosis virus  rt increased from about  <dig> error per 1680 nt additions with mg2+ to  <dig> error per 1100 nt addition with activating concentrations of co2+ , but increased further to  <dig> error per 200 nt addition when excess amounts of co2+ were used   <cit> . only  <dig>  mm free co2+ was used in these assays and it is possible that co2+ does not have a profound impact on fidelity at this concentration. this was further tested in the gapped plasmid assay described below.

a second gapped plasmid-based laczα-complementation fidelity assay, similar to the phage-based laczα gap-filling assay, was performed to further confirm results obtained from the pcr-based assay. the gap filled by the polymerase is in a plasmid construct, which after fill in, is directly transfected into bacteria. bacterial colonies rather than phage plaques are scored by blue-white screening in this assay. this assay screens a large region  of the laczα gene including the promoter sequence and it avoids the enzymatic  background issues of the pcr-based assay. the results  were in strong agreement with the pcr-based assay . in this assay, mg2+ was modestly more accurate than  <dig>  mm co2+, while zn2+ once again showed ~ <dig> –fold greater fidelity than mg2+. interestingly, mn2+, a known pro-mutagenic cation for several polymerases including hiv rt  <cit> , was comparable to mg2+ in the assays when used at its optimal concentration . however, both co2+and mn2+ were highly mutagenic when used at 6 mm, an amount which is in the same range shown by others to decrease the fidelity of several polymerases in vitro  <cit> . there was a ~25-fold decrease in fidelity with 6 mm mn2+ compared to  <dig>  mm mn2+. similarly, a ~7-fold decrease in fidelity was observed with 6 mm vs.  <dig>  mm co2+. both cations also showed severely inhibited polymerase activity at the 6 mm concentration while zn2+ incorporates only a few nts even after prolonged incubation at high concentrations . overall, the results from both the pcr-based and gapped plasmid-based laczα-complementation fidelity assays show that the fidelity of rt increases with zn2+ and presumed pro-mutagenic cations do not modify rt’s error rate significantly when used at low concentrations optimal for catalysis.table  <dig>

estimation of mutation frequency from cmf and sequencing data
an estimate of the base misincorporation frequency can be made from the cmfs in table  <dig> and the sequencing results in figure  <dig> as described before  <cit> . in experiments with mg2+, ~41%  of recovered mutations, after excluding the background mutations, were insertions or deletions , and ~59%  substitutions. using a  <dig> % detection rate for substitutions and 100% detection rate for indels in this region  and a cmf of  <dig>  , the mutation frequency for mg2+ was  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  or ~ <dig> error per  <dig>  incorporations /230 =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for indels, and /230)/ <dig>  =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for substitutions, total is  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for both ). synthesis with zn2+ resulted in a higher ratio of indels vs. substitution: indels ~63% , and ~37% substitutions  were obtained. with a cmf of  <dig>  , a mutation frequency of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> or ~  <dig> error per  <dig>  incorporations was obtained for experiments with zn2+. this value is also closer to the rate of ~ <dig> error per  <dig>  incorporations that was observed with more physiological , though sub-optimal mg2+ concentrations  <cit> .figure  <dig> dna sequence analysis from the pcr-based laczα-complementation fidelity assay. the  <dig> base region analyzed for mutations is shown. the coding strand for laczα is shown in the 5-3′ direction . numbering is as shown in figure 2c. deletions are shown as regular triangles, insertions are shown as downward triangles with the inserted base shown adjacent to the downward triangle, unless it was the same as the base in a nt run, and base substitutions are shown directly above or below the sequence. substitutions shown correspond to the recovered sequence for the coding strand; however, these mutations could have occurred during synthesis of the non-coding strand as well  . mutations recovered from hiv rt with 2 mm mg2±, and mutations from background controls are shown above the sequence as open triangles and normal text or filled triangles and bold italicized text, respectively. mutations from hiv rt at  <dig>  mm zn2+ are shown below the sequence. individual sequence clones which had multiple mutations  are marked with subscripts adjacent to the mutations. several clones with deletions  at positions 181– <dig>  just outside of the scored region were also recovered . this was the dominant mutation type recovered in background controls  and probably resulted from improper ligation events or damaged plasmid vectors .



it is also possible to estimate the mutation frequency using the plasmid-based assay results . as no sequencing data was acquired, a combined error rate for both substitutions and indels can be estimated using the formula: er=cmfd×p, where er is the error rate, cmf is the colony mutant frequency , d is the total number of detectable sites for plasmid psj <dig> which is  <dig>  p is the expression frequency of the plasmid which equals  <dig>   <cit> . the calculations yield a mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for 2 mm mg2+ and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for zn2+. a mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for  <dig>  mm mn2+ vs.  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for 6 mm mn2+  and  <dig>  ×10− <dig> for  <dig>  mm co2+ vs.  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for 6 mm co2+  was obtained. both the pcr-based and plasmid-based assays showed a comparable fidelity increase  for zn2+ vs. mg2+, although the calculated mutation frequency rates were modestly lower in the plasmid-based assay.

analysis of fidelity by steady-state kinetics also demonstrates higher fidelity with zn2+
kinetic assays have been used by many groups as a reliable way to estimate polymerase fidelity by insertion of specific nt mismatches or extension of specific mismatched primer termini . although pre-steady-state assays are more useful for understanding kinetic parameters for misincorporation, steady-state assays are much simpler to perform and typically yield results that are broadly similar to results with pre-steady-state assays  <cit> . mismatched primer extension and running-start assays using the sequences shown in figure  <dig> were performed with constant concentrations of free cation of  <dig>  mm zn2+ or 2 mm mg2+. note that reactions with each cation were performed using different enzyme concentrations and time points . this was necessary as catalysis with zn2+ is much slower than mg2+ yielding negligible levels of extension with the conditions used for mg2+. the results with zn2+ were seemingly consistent with steady-state conditions as the reactions were conducted over a prolonged period  and the ratio of unextended to extended primers remained high . however, it is possible that these reactions may to some extent reflect pre-steady-state conditions, to an extent, since rt-primer-template complexes are extremely stable in zn2+ while catalysis is slow  <cit> . because of these constraints, a direct comparison of the kinetic and equilibrium constants between the two cations cannot be made. however, the fidelity with zn2+ relative to that with mg2+ can still be estimated by comparing misinsertion ratios calculated for particular mismatches with each cation. the running-start assays performed here test rt’s ability to misincorporate at a template c or g residue  after a “running-start” on a run of t’s immediately downstream of the primer 3′ terminus. experiments were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels . a statistically pronounced  increase in fidelity was observed for all mismatches with zn2+ . the misinsertion ratio for the g.a mismatch, which is a difficult mismatch to make  <cit> , could not be evaluated with zn2+ as no incorporation was detected . in general, there was a ~4-fold to 8-fold increase in fidelity for different mismatches in zn2+ compared to mg2+.figure  <dig> a, b and c. sequences used in mismatched primer extension and running-start misincorporation assays and examples of analysis.  the sequence of the dna used in each assay type is shown. the underlined nts show the only differences between the two templates. only one primer was used in the running-start assays and it terminated at the 3′ c nt before the dashes. the four dashes indicate the  <dig> a nts that must be incorporated before rt incorporates the target nt .  running-start misincorporation of c.t base pair at 2 mm mg2+ or  <dig>  mm zn2+. reactions were performed on the primer-template shown in panel a for the indicated time with a final free concentration of 2 mm mg2+ or  <dig>  mm zn2+ . a fixed concentration of datp = 55 μm was used in all running-start reactions for elongation of the primer to the target site. the concentration of the target nt  in each lane was from l-r:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 3660 μm. for other base pair misinsertions noted in the table  <dig>  the target nt was changed according to the desired misinsertion.  extension of a mismatched primer-template with a c.t  <dig> terminus, using 2 mm mg2+ and  <dig>  mm zn2+. reactions were performed on the primer-template shown in panel a for the indicated time with the same free cation concentration as above. the concentration of the next correct nt  in each lane was from l-r:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1870 μm. -e lane corresponds to no enzyme added.

discussion
the results presented in this paper show that using concentrations optimized for catalysis, zn2+ increases the fidelity of hiv-rt approximately 2-fold to 3-fold when compared to the physiological cation mg2+. mn2+ and co2+ decreased the fidelity of rt at high concentrations; but at optimal concentrations these effects were almost completely mitigated. for zn2+, misincorporation  and mismatch extension  were both influenced, suggesting that both steps involved in fidelity could be affected by zn2+.

there may be several possible mechanisms by which zn2+ alters fidelity. the geometry supported by different cations in the active site of polymerases has been proposed to affect fidelity. magnesium supports tetrahedral symmetry at the active site, whereas mn2+ accommodates square planar, octahedral, and tetrahedral symmetries . the ability of mn2+ to accommodate more than one type of symmetry may increase the reaction rate of misaligned substrates and hence decrease the fidelity of polymerization. it is important to note that although results presented here indicate mn2+ is not highly mutagenic at optimal concentrations, this may not be the case for other polymerases. crystal structures of polymerases with zn2+ in the active site are not available, but zn2+ has been crystallized in a distorted tetrahedral symmetry in erythrocyte carbonic-anhydrase  <cit> , as well as in a near tetrahedral geometry in zn2+ superoxide dismutase  <cit> . it is possible that zn2+ supports a different geometry than mg2+ in the active site and promotes a configuration of the amino acid residues which may be better suited to discriminate against misaligned substrates.

results showed that the fidelity of hiv rt with mn2+ and co2+ was concentration-dependent, as we observed previously for mg2+  <cit> . although mn2+ is generally considered to be pro-mutagenic  <cit> , the error frequency for several dna polymerases usually increased as the mn2+ concentration increased  <cit> . in one report, e. coli dna polymerase i and mammalian dna polymerase β both showed relatively high fidelity when lower concentrations  of mn2+ were used, whereas higher concentrations lead to greater mutagenesis. the high concentrations correlated with mn2+ binding to the single stranded template and possibly to secondary binding sites on the polymerase, raising the possibility that these factors promote the lower fidelity observed at high mn2+ concentrations  <cit> . in this regard, e. coli dna polymerase i has been reported to have as many as  <dig> mn2+ binding sites on a single molecule but just a single high affinity binding site  <cit> . the effect, if any, of binding at the secondary sites is unknown. still, when compared to mg2+, careful analysis with other polymerases has suggested that mn2+ is promutagenic over a range of concentrations  <cit> . differences between our results and these may stem from intrinsic differences in the enzymes or the different nucleic acid substrate used . also, unlike rt, most dna polymerases have intrinsic exonuclease activity. el-deiry et al.  <cit>  found that e. coli dna polymerase i demonstrated a significant reduction in 3′ to 5′ exonuclease proofreading activity in the presence of mn2+. this effect exacerbated the accelerated misincorporation with mn2+ which was observed.

it is also possible that zn2+ affects the rate of conformational change in the enzyme and this leads to an alteration in fidelity. catalysis with zn2+ is extremely slow  even though the complex between the enzyme and primer-template is over  <dig> times more stable than with mg2+  <cit> . this indicates that one or more of the steps in catalysis is slow. conformational transition of the protein after binding the substrate has a significant contribution to the ability of rt to add the correct substrate  <cit> . upon binding the substrate in mg2+, the enzyme undergoes a conformational change to reach the transition state. a correctly matched nt then leads to tight binding and alignment of catalytic residues to promote catalysis, whereas a mismatched nt does not induce the tight binding state, thereby facilitating the rapid opening of the specificity domain and release of the misaligned substrate  <cit> . the conformational change in the specificity subdomain  of the polymerase plays a key role in determining the enzyme fidelity, and it will be interesting to investigate if the modified catalysis with zn2+ affects either the conformational change or the rate of conformational change in a way which might increase the specificity. consistent with the model of slower catalysis promoting higher fidelity, suboptimal mg2+ concentrations also enhanced fidelity  <cit> . the observed enhancement was similar to what was observed with zn2+ as it resulted mostly due to a decrease in substitutions rather than insertion and deletion errors. since insertions and deletions often result from primer-template slippage mechanisms, this suggests that both low mg2+ and zn2+ induce higher fidelity by intrinsically affecting rt catalysis rather than altering primer-template properties. it is possible that lowering the zn2+ concentration to suboptimal levels could also alter fidelity, however, catalysis dramatically declines as the concentration of zn2+ is either lowered or increased  <cit> , making it difficult to test this possibility.

as was noted in the introduction, the level of available zn2+ and other divalent cations such as mn2+ or co2+ are kept extremely low in cells. also, it is highly unlikely that these cations could support hiv replication. although we show the alternative cations can support rt synthesis, the rate of nucleotide catalysis ranged from significantly reduced for mn2+ and co2+, to essentially negligible for zn2+ .

finally, the possibly of using supplements or natural minerals including zn2+ to treat hiv infection must be approached with caution. low μm concentrations of zn2+, which can inhibit hiv rt  <cit> , are still ~2– <dig> orders of magnitude greater than the level of free available zn2+ in cells. low μm concentrations of free zn2+ in cells could have profound effects on the transcription of specific genes and the oxidation state of cells. nevertheless, zn2+ as a constituent of cation based compounds like topical ointments for treating hiv infection still holds promise.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we demonstrate that dna synthesis by hiv rt in zn2+ is slow, but highly accurate. it was even more accurate than with the physiologically relevant cation mg2+, when both were used at optimal concentrations. other presumably pro-mutagenic cations  showed fidelity levels that were comparable to mg2+ under optimal conditions, while they were highly mutagenic when used at very high concentrations. this suggests that catalysis with these alternative cations is not intrinsically mutagenic and the observed mutagenicity in previous reports, may result from other mechanisms that could occur at high concentrations  that warrants further investigation.
