BACKGROUND
the p <dig> tumour suppressor protein orchestrates cellular response to genotoxic stress such as dna damage, activated oncogenes and other metabolic changes  <cit> . in unstressed cells, p <dig> is kept at a low level through the action of various ubiquitin ligases  <cit> , while cellular stress results in the stabilization of p <dig> and its activation as a transcription factor. although activated p <dig> is able to induce cell death via transcription-independent ways  <cit> , importantly, it influences the transcription of a large number of genes, that in turn promote cell cycle arrest, dna repair or apoptosis  <cit> . the multiple mechanisms that stabilize and activate p <dig> include post-translational modifications and interactions with different co-factors. for example, upon dna damage resulting from ionizing radiation p <dig> is phosphorylated by atm/atr and chk1/chk <dig> kinases  <cit> . activation of p <dig> upon uv radiation is less well understood, among other mechanisms, it may involve p33ing <dig> that increases the transcriptional-transactivation activity of p <dig> by enhancing its acetylation  <cit> . interestingly, p33ing <dig> is a plant homeodomain  containing protein  <cit> .

in vertebrates, the p <dig> gene has two other homologs, p <dig> and p <dig>  both of them express several isoforms through alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing, thereby generating a multitude of p53-related proteins that participate in the regulation of p <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . the only drosophila homolog of p <dig>  dmp <dig>  shares limited conservation with mammalian p <dig> at the sequence level, yet the two proteins are similar in domain structure and their residues critical for dna binding are well preserved  <cit> . importantly, dmp <dig> is able to bind to human p <dig> recognition sites and activate transcription through these sites. dmp <dig> null mutant flies are viable under normal circumstances, however, they show genomic instability and sensitivity to ionizing and uv radiation  <cit> . overexpression of wild type p <dig> or dmp <dig> in flies induces cell death, while expression of dominant negative dmp <dig> inhibits apoptosis induced by genotoxic stimuli  <cit> . in response to dna damage, dmp <dig> induces dna repair or programmed cell death by activating the expression of its target genes  <cit> . activation of dmp <dig> apparently does not involve stabilization of the protein, but similarly to its human counterpart, dmp <dig> is phosphorylated by chk <dig> and this modification is necessary for the induction of dmp <dig> dependent apoptosis  <cit> .

activation domains of various transcription factors are able to interact directly with tata binding protein  associated factors , thus tafs are thought to serve as bridging factors between sequence-specific transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> . the p <dig> protein has also been found to interact with several components of the tfiid complex. the n-terminal transcriptional activation domain of p <dig> binds to taf <dig>  taf <dig> and taf <dig>  <cit> . while binding of taf <dig> results in stabilization and activation of p <dig>  <cit> , taf <dig> phosphorylates p <dig> and promotes its degradation  <cit> . these interactions are evolutionarily conserved, since drosophila tafs and tbp can functionally interact with human p <dig> in heterolog systems  <cit> .

dmtaf3/bip <dig>  was first identified in a yeast two hybrid screen as an interacting partner of bab <dig> and bab <dig>  drosophila transcription factors  <cit> . also, both drosophila and mammalian taf <dig> were found to be subunits of the respective tfiid complexes and dimerization partners for taf <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, taf <dig> is also a phd containing protein  <cit> . developmental regulation of taf <dig> expression has been demonstrated  <cit>  and it has been recently shown that differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes involves the replacement of a canonical tfiid complex by a trf3-taf <dig> complex  <cit> . this previously unrecognized switching of the core promoter recognition complexes during differentiation may allow cells to selectively turn on a cell type-specific transcription program.

in search for interacting partners of dmp <dig>  we identified drosophila bip2/dmtaf <dig>  unlike the previously identified p53-interacting tafs, dmtaf <dig> interacts with the c terminus of dmp <dig>  the interaction is evolutionarily conserved, since we show that mammalian taf <dig> can bind to both dmp <dig> and human p <dig>  overexpression of taf <dig> severely inhibits transcription activation by p <dig> in human cell lines and taf <dig> decreases the level of the p <dig> protein as well. thus, we identified taf <dig> as an evolutionarily conserved novel regulator of p <dig> transcription activation function.

RESULTS
dmp <dig> interacts with bip2/dmtaf3
in order to identify dmp53-interacting partners, we screened drosophila embryonic cdna library with the yeast two-hybrid  method using dmp <dig> fused to lexa dna binding domain  as bait. since dmp <dig> contains a transcription activation domain at its n terminus, to avoid false activation, we used an n-terminally truncated version of dmp <dig>  two of the identified positive clones contained partial cdnas of the bric-à-brac interacting protein gene , that encodes for a tbp-associated factor also called dmtaf <dig>  <cit> . a  <dig> bp long clone  encodes amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  while an  <dig> bp long clone  encodes amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of dmtaf <dig>  indicating that amino acids 738– <dig> are responsible for the interaction with dmp <dig> 

to determine which region of dmp <dig> is necessary for the binding to dmtaf <dig>  we tested various segments of dmp <dig>  for interaction with one of the identified dmtaf <dig> clones  in y2h experiments. the dna binding domain of dmp <dig> showed weak interaction, and the c terminal part of dmp <dig> showed strong interaction with dmtaf <dig> in the y2h assay . in contrast, no interaction was observed between dmtaf <dig> and drosophila ada2a, a transcriptional co-activator/adaptor, indicating that the interaction between dmp <dig> and dmtaf <dig> is specific. we tried to delineate the c-terminal binding region of dmp <dig>  and we found that the oligomerization domain alone interacted strongly, and also the basic regulatory domain alone interacted weakly with dmtaf <dig> . these data suggest that dmtaf <dig> interacts with dmp <dig> at multiple binding sites.

to test whether the interaction between dmtaf <dig> and dmp <dig> is direct, we performed an in vitro binding assay. we produced the polypeptide corresponding to amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of dmtaf <dig> using rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription-translation system and bacterially expressed and purified gst-tagged dmp53c . the identified portion of dmtaf <dig> bound to gst-dmp53c, but not to gst , suggesting that the interaction is specific and direct.

the interaction between taf <dig> and p <dig> is evolutionarily conserved
despite the low sequence similarity between dmp <dig> and human p <dig>  human p <dig> has been observed before to interact with drosophila tbp  <cit> , and other drosophila proteins that are also binding partners of dmp <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we were interested in whether dmtaf <dig> is able to interact with human p <dig>  since human p <dig> also contains transcription activation domain at its n-terminal region, to avoid false positives, we used n-terminally deleted p <dig> in y2h assays . we detected strong interaction between dmtaf <dig> and human p <dig> protein . this result suggests that the amino acids responsible for interaction with dmtaf <dig> are conserved in human p <dig> 

next we tested whether the mammalian homolog of dmtaf <dig> would interact in vitro with p <dig> as well. to this end we expressed full length murine taf <dig>  in sf <dig> insect cells and produced gst, gst-dmp53c or gst-p <dig> in bacteria . in these gst-pull-down assays mtaf <dig> bound to gst-dmp53c and gst-p <dig> . note however, that mtaf <dig> showed a weak binding to gst alone under  <dig> mm salt washing conditions , but it bound specifically to gst-dmp53c and gst-p <dig> at higher salt concentration   where it did not bind to the gst control any more . these data indicate that mtaf <dig> specifically interacts with p <dig>  and also, although less strongly, with dmp <dig> suggesting that the taf3-p <dig> interaction is evolutionarily conserved.

to confirm the interaction in a reverse experiment, where we pull down taf <dig>  we translated full length human p <dig> and drosophila ada2a or firefly luciferase as controls in vitro, mixed them with cell extract containing overexpressed mtaf <dig>  and immunoprecipitated mtaf3-containing complexes using an anti-taf <dig> antibody. p <dig> co-precipitated with mtaf <dig>  while ada2a and luciferase did not . in another control experiment, where we added p <dig> and luciferase proteins together to the cell extract containing overexpressed mtaf <dig>  anti-taf <dig> antibody co-immunoprecipitated p <dig> but not luciferase . furthermore, when we added p <dig> to cell extract containing no mtaf <dig>  p <dig> did not precipitate with the anti-taf <dig> antibody . these data confirm a specific interaction between p <dig> and mtaf <dig> 

next we investigated, whether the p53-taf <dig> interaction occurs in human cells as well. to this end, we co-transfected plasmids expressing mtaf <dig> and p <dig> into 293t cells, then we immunoprecipitated taf3-containing complexes with an anti-taf <dig> antibody, and detected p <dig> by western blotting. under these conditions, a small amount of the overexpressed p <dig> co-precipitated with mtaf <dig> . in the control experiment, when we co-transfected p <dig> with an empty vector, no p <dig> precipitated with the anti-taf <dig> antibody , indicating the specificity of the taf <dig> antibody. these data together demonstrate that p <dig> protein can interact with taf <dig> in cells.

taf <dig> inhibits the transcription activation function of p53
to determine the functional significance of the binding of taf <dig> to p <dig>  we studied the effect of taf <dig> overexpression on the transactivation activity of p <dig>  when we transfected u2os cells, which express wild type level of p <dig>  with a luciferase reporter construct containing the p53-responsive element from the human mdm <dig> gene, we detected high luciferase activity . when we co-transfected increasing amounts of a plasmid overexpressing mtaf <dig>  we observed a dramatic  reduction in luciferase activity , indicating that taf <dig> severely inhibits transcription activation by p <dig>  to exclude that this phenomenon is cell type specific, we co-transfected hela cells with the same luciferase reporter as before together with a plasmid overexpressing p <dig>  and a plasmid overexpressing mtaf <dig>  overexpression of taf <dig> inhibited transactivation by overexpressed p <dig> in hela cells as well . note however, that the effects observed by using overexpressed p <dig> were less dramatic, as we saw only a 45% reduction in reporter activity . we wanted to further determine if the effect of taf <dig> on transcription is specific to p <dig> or if it is a general inhibition of transcription. when we co-transfected a luciferase reporter driven by the cytomegalovirus  promoter with increasing amounts of mtaf <dig>  we found that taf <dig> had no effect on promoter activity . thus, overexpression of taf <dig> strongly and specifically inhibits the transcriptional activity of endogenous p <dig> 

the phd domain of taf <dig> has been found to interact with tri-methylated histone h <dig>  <cit> , thus it seems to be important for recognizing transcriptionally active genes. therefore, we wanted to determine if the phd domain of taf <dig> is essential for its inhibitory role on p <dig>  we cloned the human taf <dig> lacking the phd domain  from hela cdna library. in co-transfection experiments, htaf3Δc inhibited transactivation by p <dig> in hela cells . the degree of inhibition using htaf3Δc or full length mtaf <dig> was comparable . therefore, we conclude that the phd domain of taf <dig> is not essential for its role as a negative regulator of p <dig> transcriptional activity.

overexpression of taf <dig> decreases the p <dig> protein level but has no effect on the p <dig> mrna level
to further investigate the mechanism of inhibition of p <dig> transcriptional activity, we wanted to determine if taf <dig> has an effect on the level of p <dig> protein. transfection of increasing amounts of taf <dig> into u2os cells resulted in reduced level of endogenous p <dig>  but no change in the level of endogenous β-actin was observed . to exclude the cell type specificity of this phenomenon, we co-transfected p <dig> and gfp with or without taf <dig> into hela cells. here too, we saw down-regulation of p <dig>  but not gfp, protein levels upon overexpression of taf <dig> , indicating that taf <dig> decreases the p <dig> protein level. in hela cells the decrease in the level of p <dig> was comparable to the inhibition in the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  however, in u2os cells the reduction in the level of the p <dig> protein was not as dramatic as the reduction in the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  suggesting that down-regulation of p <dig> protein level may not solely be responsible for decreased transcriptional activity of p <dig> 

we wanted to further determine if reduced level of the p <dig> protein is a result of decreased level of the p <dig> mrna. we measured the level of endogenous p <dig> mrna in u2os cells transfected with empty vector or increasing amounts of taf <dig> by performing reverse transcription and qpcr. we found no effect of taf <dig> overexpression on the level of p <dig> mrna  suggesting that taf <dig> does not influence the mrna expression of p <dig>  but rather affects the protein expression or turnover of p <dig>  thus, we conclude that taf <dig> may inhibit transcription activation function of p <dig> partly by reducing the level of p <dig> protein.

discussion
bip2/dmtaf <dig> was first identified in a yeast two hybrid screen as an interacting partner of bab <dig> and bab <dig>  developmentally regulated transcription factors, which are involved in pattern formation and morphogenesis in drosophila  <cit> . the btb/poz domains of bab <dig> and bab <dig> were shown to mediate the direct interaction with bip2/taf <dig>  and amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> in the middle part of bip2/dmtaf <dig> were responsible for the binding to bab1/ <dig>  whether the interaction between bab1/ <dig> and bip2/dmtaf <dig> mediates transcriptional activation or repression has not been determined.

bip2/dmtaf <dig> was also identified as tafii <dig>  the drosophila homolog of yeast taf <dig>  formerly called ytafii <dig>  <cit> . dmtaf <dig> was shown to heterodimerize with dmtaf <dig> and to be a component of the general transcription factor tfiid. dmtaf <dig> localizes to puffs and interbands on polytene chromosomes, which correspond to transcriptionally active chromatin. the mammalian homolog of dmtaf <dig> was designated tafii <dig>  <cit>  and later called taf <dig>  <cit> . human taf <dig> was also shown to bind to taf <dig> through its histone fold domain and to be a component of both tfiid and tftc. taf <dig> relies on taf <dig>  among other tafs, for its nuclear import  <cit> .

taf <dig> expression is developmentally regulated, as it is strongly expressed in early spermatocytes, but it is downregulated in haploid cells  <cit> . differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes involves the disruption of a "normal" tfiid complex and its replacement by a not yet well characterized trf3-taf <dig> complex  <cit> . the switching of core promoter recognition complexes during differentiation provides cells to selectively turn on one transcription program, while silencing many others, and thus it may represent a general mechanism for regulating cell type-specific terminal differentiation.

here we identified taf <dig>  as an interacting partner of p <dig>  the central region, amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of dmtaf <dig> mediates the interaction with p <dig> , a region distinct from the proposed a/t hook domain . interestingly, several researchers have recently identified the same central region of dmtaf <dig> to interact with various transcription factors, such as gaga factor   <cit> , antennapedia   <cit>  and bab1/ <dig>   <cit> . although this central region of dmtaf <dig> shows low degree of similarity to the corresponding core region of mammalian taf <dig>   <cit> , we propose that it may serve as a transcription factor-binding domain responsible for interaction with other, yet unidentified transcription factors as well. we think that the taf3-p <dig> interaction is direct and does not involve previously characterized p <dig> interacting components of tfiid, since we detected in vitro binding between bacterially expressed dmp <dig> and in vitro translated portion of dmtaf <dig> . the interaction is evolutionarily conserved, since dmtaf <dig> can also interact with human p <dig> , as well as mammalian taf <dig> can bind to both dmp <dig> and human p <dig> in heterologous systems . importantly, unlike previously identified tafs that interact with the n terminal transcription activation domain of p <dig> and mediate transcription activation, taf <dig> interacts with the c terminal oligomerization and regulatory domain of p <dig> and represses p <dig> activity.

elevated taf <dig> expression strongly inhibits transcription activation by p <dig> in at least two human cell lines containing either endogenous or overexpressed p <dig> . this effect of taf <dig> is specific to p <dig>  since we found no effect of taf <dig> on transcription regulated by the cmv promoter  indicating that it does not inhibit the transcriptional activity of the factors that bind to these elements. furthermore, in other studies taf <dig> had no inhibitory effect on atf <dig>  <cit> , and it even acted as a coactivator for wdr5-dependent genes  <cit> . the phd finger is a specialized form of zinc finger that is classically characterized by c4hc <dig> arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues involved in zn coordination  <cit> . the phd finger was shown to be essential for the coactivator activity of taf <dig>  <cit> , in contrast, we found that the phd finger was not required for the inhibitory activity of taf <dig> on p <dig>  although most phd finger containing proteins were implicated in mediating interaction with chromatin  <cit> , other reports described e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity of phd containing viral and cellular proteins  <cit> . since we found that overexpression of taf <dig> reduces p <dig> protein level , we examined the possibility that taf <dig> may act as an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase for p <dig>  however, in our preliminary experiments we could not detect any ubiquitin ligase activity of taf <dig> towards p <dig> in either in vitro or in vivo ubuiquitination assays . because taf <dig> is a subunit of tfiid, and interacts with several additional proteins  <cit> , it is conceivable that taf <dig> recruits a ubiquitin ligase to p <dig> to increase its turnover. in hela cells the reduction in the level of p <dig> was comparable to the reduction seen in the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  while in u2os cells the decrease in the level of the p <dig> protein was not as dramatic as the reduction seen in the transcriptional activity of p <dig> . this latter observation suggests that down-regulation of p <dig> protein level by taf <dig> may not solely be responsible for reduced transcriptional activity of p <dig>  but additionally, taf <dig> may directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of p <dig>  we speculate that the additional mechanisms taf <dig> employs to inhibit p <dig> transcriptional activity may include posttranslational modifications, such as sumoylation  <cit> , but the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
here we identify taf <dig> as an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of p <dig> transcription activation function. we show physical interaction between the c terminus of dmp <dig> and the central region of taf <dig> both in yeast two hybrid assays and in vitro. the interaction is evolutionarily conserved, since dmtaf <dig> can also interact with human p <dig>  and mammalian taf <dig> can bind to both dmp <dig> and human p <dig>  elevated taf <dig> expression results in severe specific inhibition of transcription activation by p <dig> in human cell lines, which may be partly due to a decrease in the level of the p <dig> protein.
