BACKGROUND
sexual reproduction  is the predominant reproductive mode in eukaryotes, yet parthenogenesis  is present in all major lineages. among animals, cyclical parthenogenesis, which alternates bouts of clonal and sexual reproduction, is restricted to monogonont rotifers, digenean trematodes, and several arthropod lineages  <cit> . obligate parthenogenesis is much more common but is predicted ultimately to drive lineages to extinction due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations or inability to adapt to environmental changes  <cit> . the origins of obligate parthenogens are often attributed to the loss of meiosis via interspecific hybridization  <cit>  or irreversible changes in ploidy  <cit> , yet other mechanisms must also exist. among animals, thousands of parthenogenetic species have been described, and volumes have been written describing the cytogenetic manifestations of many different types of parthenogenesis , but little is understood about molecular determinants of these processes.

the microcrustacean daphnia pulex reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis. direct-developing eggs  are produced parthenogenetically and immediately develop in the female's brood chamber prior to hatching. during the sexual cycle, haploid resting eggs  are produced by meiosis and require fertilization and a period of extended dormancy for development to complete. because sex determination in daphnia is environmentally induced  <cit> , males are genetic clones of their mothers. in addition, genetic and phenotypic evidence has revealed d. pulex lineages that reproduce by obligate parthenogenesis. these obligate parthenogenetic lineages produce direct-developing eggs by parthenogenesis, which is indistinguishable from parthenogenesis in cyclical lineages. however, obligate parthenogens have lost the requirement for meiosis and fertilization to produce viable resting eggs  <cit> ; unfertilized resting eggs undergo a period of diapause and develop parthenogenetically to eventually hatch and produce a juvenile. importantly, the resting egg parthenogenesis exhibited by these obligate asexual lineages is cytologically distinct from direct-developing egg parthenogenesis in both obligate and cyclical parthenogenetic lineages and from meiosis. hence, although the terms "cyclical parthenogenesis" and "obligate parthenogenesis" may also refer to breeding systems, herein we use these terms to distinguish parthenogenetic oogenesis that takes place during direct-developing  and resting egg development , respectively. therefore, the d. pulex genome must contain the molecular machinery to accommodate various types of reproductive modes: meiosis  and parthenogenetic oogenesis in both cyclical and obligate parthenogenetic lineages. this feature makes d. pulex an ideal model to investigate the genetic basis of parthenogenesis, and its consequences for gene and genome evolution.

resting egg parthenogenesis in daphnia is cytologically distinct compared to direct-developing egg parthenogenesis . however, while obligate parthenogenesis apparently involves initial meiotic pairing  followed by a mitotic or mitotic-like division , neither obligate nor cyclical parthenogenesis seems to be strictly mitotic since a polar body is extruded during cell division, indicative of meiosis  <cit> . in both cases, heterozygosity is maintained, except in rare instances of loss of heterozygosity presumably caused by mitotic crossing over  <cit> . obligate parthenogenesis in daphnia is limited to the d. pulex complex   <cit>  and to the d. carinata complex   <cit> , and at least in some cases, the trait is passed by male offspring of obligate asexuals into sexual backgrounds, implying a sex-limited meiosis suppressor  <cit> . in d. pulex, obligate asexuality has been migrating from northeastern to central north america, and most clonal lineages are estimated to be no more than  <dig>  –  <dig>  yr  <cit> . recent association mapping of obligate asexuality in daphnia has found markers on four different chromosomes exhibiting significant association with parthenogenetic production of resting eggs in obligate asexuals  <cit> . this suggests that obligate asexuality and  the mechanistic transition from meiosis to parthenogenesis could be influenced by at least four epistatically interacting loci.

specifically, we are interested in genes that encode components essential for meiosis in d. pulex. a cyclically parthenogenetic d. pulex lineage possesses genes required for both meiosis and parthenogenesis. to ultimately establish whether modifications to the meiotic machinery are associated with parthenogenesis, we must first determine which meiotic genes are present and expressed in cyclically parthenogenetic lineages. then, we can compare the inventory and expression patterns of these same genes in obligate parthenogens. if obligate parthenogens have truly abandoned canonical meiosis altogether, genes required specifically for meiosis should be under reduced selective constraint and become non-functional over time. however, certain meiotic processes, perhaps in a modified form, may still be required for parthenogenesis and, thus, genes required for such processes may still be intact and expressed. differences in the inventory, evolutionary rates and expression of meiotic genes in cyclical and obligate parthenogens may provide insight into the importance of meiotic genes for the evolution of parthenogenesis.

during a typical animal meiosis , a germline stem-cell  divides asymmetrically producing a daughter gsc and either a cystoblast  or gonialblast   <cit> . during both meiosis and parthenogenesis in daphnia females, incomplete mitoses create a 4-cell cystoblast which matures into an oocyte cluster of three nurse cells and the presumptive oocyte  <cit> . only later in vitellogenesis can parthenogenetically-produced oocytes be distinguished visually from meiotically-produced oocytes  <cit> . as the oocyte cluster matures, pre-meiotic s-phase dna replication occurs in the oocyte, followed by heterochromatin and centromere specification and, in most animals, appearance of the synaptonemal complex   <cit> . in most organisms studied, cohesin complexes are recruited during s-phase to promote cohesion between sister chromatids  <cit> . several mechanisms have been reported to initiate chiasmata formation and recombination between homologous chromosomes, including double-strand break  formation and dsb-independent pathways  <cit> . as recombination progresses, syntelic attachment of sister kinetochores  generates monopolar tension towards the spindle poles, leading to segregation of homologous chromosome pairs at anaphase and cytokinesis resulting in two diploid cells  <cit> . in the second meiotic division, amphitelic attachment of kinetochores  and the complete removal of cohesin allow sister chromatids to segregate to opposite poles  <cit> . as a result, one haploid cell is formed; it becomes the ovum while two polar bodies are produced and eventually degenerate.

while parthenogenesis in daphnia shares some features with meiosis , there are important differences. first, during parthenogenesis sister chromatids segregate in a mitosis-like fashion, suggesting that sister chromatid cohesion must be different. this could be a result of parthenogenesis-specific cohesin complexes or altered timing of cohesin removal. second, parthenogenetic kinetochore orientation should be amphitelic , again to allow pairs of sister chromatids to segregate towards opposite poles. lastly, recombination likely differs compared to meiosis because heterozygosity is maintained during parthenogenetic reproduction and chiasmata are not observed  <cit> . these changes likely involve a modification of recombination bias away from reciprocal and homologous exchange to between sisters or to no recombination at all  <cit> .

the major stages of meiosis and the genes which are the targets of our inventory in d. pulex are indicated in fig.  <dig>  the genes were chosen with a focus on female meiosis and their potential role in parthenogenesis. in this study, we report an inventory of genes in the genome of a cyclically parthenogenetic strain of d. pulex  that encode proteins with roles throughout meiosis. this represents an initial step in identifying and characterizing the genes that are central to reproduction in d. pulex. we have divided these meiotic genes intro two broad categories. first, we investigate "meiosis-related genes": these are genes that encode proteins involved in meiosis but whose functions and expression are not specific to meiosis. these include genes encoding argonaute proteins , cell cycle regulation proteins  and polo kinases) and several proteins involved in dna replication, cohesion and meiotic recombination , timeless  and recq proteins). second, we investigate several meiosis-specific genes in our inventory: these are genes for which homologs in most model organisms function are expressed only during meiosis and mutants containing null alleles are defective only in meiosis. these genes include spo <dig>  mnd <dig>  hop <dig>  dmc <dig>  rec <dig>  msh <dig>  and msh <dig>  which encode proteins that together generally affect the initiation and progression of meiotic recombination and sister chromatid cohesion. we also examine gene families that are closely involved in the above processes: these include structural maintenance of chromosome  and stromal antigen  gene families, rad <dig> and rad54b paralogs, and eukaryotic homologs of bacterial mutl and muts genes. database homology searches and rigorous phylogenetic analyses are employed to identify orthologs and distinguish paralogs. for  <dig> gene copies, we use rt-pcr to compare expression levels in ovaries of females undergoing meiosis or obligate  parthenogenesis, in males  and in female somatic tissue. we interpret our results from these experiments in light of a model of the genetic underpinnings of parthenogenesis we have developed for d. pulex.

the gene inventory and the expression patterns of these genes during meiosis and parthenogenesis will help us address whether parthenogenesis uses existing meiotic and mitotic machinery, or whether novel processes may be involved. while thelytokous parthenogenesis may occur via various cytological mechanisms  <cit> , parthenogenesis in daphnia appears to be apomictic and does not involve gametic fusion as would be observed with automictic reproduction  <cit> . the transition from meiosis to parthenogenesis in daphnia requires at least three modifications: altered spindle attachment of the kinetochore, modified sister chromatid cohesion and abrogation of homologous recombination . it is not clear whether any one of these changes is necessary or sufficient for the origin of thelytokous parthenogenesis in d. pulex, or whether they are pertinent for other types of parthenogenesis such as arrhenotoky. however, these modifications must involve characterized pathways in mitosis and meiosis, for which mutant phenotypes closely resemble the cytogenetic manifestations characteristic of parthenogenotes  <cit> . therefore, our inventory includes genes required for these and other meiotic processes.

RESULTS
our primary goal is to determine whether features of the d. pulex genome could account for differences between parthenogenesis and meiosis. the presence/absence, copy number and expression pattern of each meiotic gene will influence our model for parthenogenesis. we have annotated several gene families in d. pulex with known functions in the meiotic pathways above. here we describe duplications of genes relating to several relevant processes, including sister chromatid cohesion, centromere orientation, and crossover suppression during homologous recombination. we also describe the maintenance of single gene copies for many proteins involved in homologous recombination, specifically in dsb formation, recombination initiation, strand invasion and holliday junction resolution.

daphnia homologs of drosophila meiotic genes
initially, we searched for genes in d. pulex that have known meiotic roles in drosophila melanogaster  and determined whether these genes are expressed during cyclical parthenogenesis and if gross differences in expression levels were evident when comparing direct-developing  and resting  egg production. gene expression was empirically determined by agarose gel electrophoresis of rt-pcr products; amplicons were evidence for gene expression while negative results indicated a lack of expression . oogenesis during cyclical parthenogenesis in daphnia does not appear to be mitotic . therefore, expression of a meiotic gene during direct-developing egg production could suggest that parthenogenesis requires components of the meiotic machinery. alternatively, absence of expression could provide insight into which processes in meiosis are absent or modified in parthenogenesis.

in d. pulex, we determined the presence or absence of  <dig> homologs of drosophila meiotic genes from flybase  <cit>   based on blast search results because initially we were interested in whether parthenogenetic reproduction is associated with lack of expression of meiosis-associated genes. rt-pcr from  <dig> distinct genotypes of pooled whole females revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> of these genes are expressed during d. pulex oogenesis  . cyclically parthenogenetic females producing either direct-developing or resting eggs demonstrated indistinguishable expression patterns . therefore, gross discrepancies in expression levels of these genes during parthenogenetic and meiotic reproduction in cyclical parthenogens are unlikely to be responsible for the mechanistic differences between these reproductive modes.

genes were detected by blast protein homology searches using annotations and literature available at flybase  <cit> . evidence for gene expression  was determined using cdna from pooled genotypes of cyclical parthenogens producing either resting eggs  or direct-developing eggs . expression patterns between meiosis and parthenogenesis were indistinguishable.

in the course of cataloging these genes in d. pulex, we found gene copy number expansions for many additional meiotic genes and gene families. we have divided these genes into two categories: i) meiosis-related genes and ii) meiosis-specific genes . these genes were subject to rigorous phylogenetic analyses and, in many cases, expression studies which are discussed in the following sections.

see figures  <dig> to  <dig> for phylogenetic positions of all gene copies. protein ids, genomic coordinates and expression data for each gene copy is available in additional file  <dig>  partial gene sequences and putative pseudogenes are not included below, but are discussed in the text and also provided in additional file  <dig> 

i) meiosis-related genes
a) argonaute proteins 
the argonaute protein family is comprised of the piwi and ago subfamilies. these proteins bind distinct subsets of small  repeat-associated rnas   <cit>  and constitute core elements of the rna-induced silencing complex  . a central function of piwi subfamily proteins is transposon control in the germ line mediated via binding pirnas, which has been shown to be important for normal meiosis and germ cell development, but other roles in chromatin formation and  kinetochore specification are likely. the production of pachytene pirnas in mouse, which are depleted of transposon sequences, also indicates roles for piwi subfamily proteins beyond transposon control  <cit> . in drosophila, the piwi subfamily protein aubergine  has demonstrated roles in pirna binding and dna damage signaling, and this family is implicated in a range of other processes as well  <cit> . independent experiments using microarrays to monitor gene expression during resting egg production in sexual and obligate asexual d. pulex  also revealed some copies of this family to be differentially expressed, prompting us to conduct a more thorough phylogenetic analysis of these proteins.

for d. pulex, the argonaute protein family phylogeny distinguishes seven piwi and two ago subfamily proteins, each of which is encoded by individual genes . among the piwi subfamily proteins, six  form a clade within the larger aub/piwi clade, indicating multiple gene duplications have occurred in the daphnia lineage. duplications are also present in other arthropod lineages and caenorhabditis. the seventh protein  is present among arthropod ago <dig> homologs. d. pulex also has single ago <dig> and ago <dig> homologs  closely related to arthropod orthologs of these genes. the three d. pulex proteins not included in the initial analysis  are truncated copies which are difficult to align and likely represent pseudogenes; a subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed strong support for  <dig> and  <dig> within the arthropod ago <dig> clade, and a long branch for  <dig> within the daphnia aub/piwi clade .

b) cell cycle proteins: cyclins, cdks, polo kinases
the cyclins and their regulatory counterparts, cyclin-dependent kinases , have important roles in the mitotic cell cycle and in meiotic cell division . there are four cyclin families  for which mutants exhibit meiotic defects in mammals  <cit> , and we searched the d. pulex genome for homologs of these proteins. cyclins a and b are involved in m-phase progression and regulation. for example, in drosophila, cyclin a stability controls progression of cystoblast divisions and oocyte cell fate  <cit> . cyclins d and e are part of the g <dig> complex. cyclin d has important roles in cell proliferation and regulation of the cell cycle, transcription, histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . in mammals, data from null mutants reveal important roles for cyclin d in follicle cell maturation and spermatogenesis  <cit> . cyclin e is involved in g <dig> to s phase progression by its regulatory association with cdk <dig> and also has a cdk-independent role in dna replication by regulating activity of the replicative mcm helicase  <cit> .

there are a total of ten homologs encoding cyclins a, b, d, and e in d. pulex . in the phylogenetic analysis of animal cyclin proteins , cyclins a, b, d, and e each form strongly supported clades and earlier duplications gave rise to the cyclin a/b and d/e lineages. the single d. pulex cyclin a  is related to arthropod sequences within the cyclin a clade, and its gene model is supported by both cdna and tiling path evidence . the cyclin b family is larger, containing one cyclin b <dig> homolog  and five additional gene copies encoding cyclin b . among these five copies, proteins  <dig> and  <dig> form a strongly supported clade, but their long branch lengths indicate rapid evolution, suggesting a possible long branch attraction artifact. when  <dig> is removed from the analysis,  <dig> appears as a long branch within the vertebrate cyclin b <dig> clade . however, when  <dig> is omitted,  <dig> does not show strong affinity for any cyclin classes . this is consistent with the difficulty we had in aligning  <dig>  and this protein is the only cyclin b copy without expression data , and for which we were unable to validate expression using primers derived from the gene model . thus, while the gene encoding  <dig> possibly represents a pseudogene, the divergent cyclin b homolog  <dig> presents an interesting case for further study.

for cyclin d, arthropod homologs are distinguished from clades formed by vertebrate cyclins d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> . d. pulex has two copies encoding cyclin d proteins  which are related to other arthropod homologs. most other arthropods in the analysis  have only one cyclin d copy . while vertebrates typically have two distinct cyclin e homologs, e <dig> and e <dig>  invertebrates usually contain only one. the single cyclin e copy in d. pulex  is related to invertebrate homologs, although its position among arthropods is not strongly supported.

cyclin-dependent kinases , the regulatory binding partners of cyclins, have roles in cell-cycle progression through meiosis and are synthesized and degraded in a cell cycle-dependent manner . cdk <dig>  regulates g2-m phase progression and interacts with a-and b-type cyclins. defects in meiosis i spindle assembly have been demonstrated for cdk <dig> mutants  <cit> . cdk <dig> mainly interacts with a and e-type cyclins  to regulate g <dig> to s progression. chromosome pairing is defective and meiosis is incomplete when cdk <dig> is absent in mammalian cells  <cit> . cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> regulate progression through g <dig> to s phase and interact with d-type cyclins  <cit> . cdk <dig> regulates the g2-m phase and inhibits transactivation of the ets <dig> transcription factor which regulates cdk <dig> expression  <cit> . we characterized homologs encoding four cdk family members in d. pulex: cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> , cdk4/ <dig> and cdk <dig> 

in d. pulex, there are single gene copies of each cdk family member . in the phylogeny , each cdk protein forms a strongly supported clade. d. pulex proteins  <dig> and  <dig> cluster with arthropod cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> proteins, respectively. the tree topology suggests a vertebrate-specific cdk4/cdk <dig> gene duplication, and the relationship of the d. pulex cdk <dig> homolog  with either vertebrate or arthropod homologs is unresolved. invertebrate cdk <dig> protein sequences, including d. pulex cdk <dig> , have long branch lengths compared to vertebrates . the cdk gene family is not markedly expanded in d. pulex .

polo kinases  have well-characterized roles in regulating mitotic cell-cycle progression and spindle attachment to kinetochores during meiosis  <cit> . polo-like kinase  <dig>  is present in many eukaryotes and is the best studied of the group. in yeast, the plk <dig> homolog cdc <dig> promotes spindle co-orientation, chiasmata resolution and meiosis i exit . in addition, phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit sa <dig> by plk <dig> is critical for cohesin removal during prophase  <cit> . while evidence suggests that plk <dig>  plk <dig> and plk <dig> are also involved in cell cycle progression, their functions are less well-understood.

we found eleven plk homologs in d. pulex ; however, six homologs  were removed from the phylogenetic analysis because they were either too short and/or were difficult to align . the phylogeny  shows that d. pulex has at least three gene copies encoding plk <dig> and single copies each for plk2/ <dig> and plk <dig> . for plk <dig>  multiple independent gene duplications are evident in d. pulex and c. elegans lineages. d. pulex proteins polo-a, b and c form a clade but their relationship relative to other animals is unresolved. polo-a and polo-c are separated by almost  <dig> mb on scaffold  <dig>  for plk <dig> and plk <dig>  vertebrate gene copies evolved via an ancient gene duplication ; the d. pulex  and nematostella proteins  are basal to the vertebrate plk2/ <dig> clade and plk2/plk <dig> orthologs were lost in the other insects examined. d. pulex polo-e is present among other arthropod sequences in the plk <dig> clade.

six putative plk homologs initially removed from the alignment  were included in a separate plk <dig>  plk <dig> and plk <dig> phylogenetic analysis . polo-f to polo-k were present within the plk <dig> clade with strong support, however these proteins apparently do not represent complete and intact genes . however, these copies evidently contain stop codons  or re-arrangements . therefore, these partial plk copies appear to be pseudogenes, or remnants of partial gene duplications, based on: i) lack of expression evidence, ii) apparent gene chimerism or rearrangements, iii) truncated length, and/or iv) premature stop codons.

c) replication factors: mcm, tim, recq
sister chromatid cohesion is normally established early in dna replication  and because cohesion is likely more dynamic and highly regulated than most models would indicate  <cit> , a wide variety of replication factors may influence cohesin loading. the establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion plays a critical role in our model for parthenogenesis in d. pulex . in this section, we focus on proteins involved in regulating dna replication and establishing and maintaining sister chromatid cohesion. specifically, we search for homologs within the minichromosome maintenance  family of replication factors, the timeless family  and the recq family of dna helicases.

within the mcm family of dna helicases , six members  are structurally related and function together as a hexameric helicase in dna replication. additionally, the mcm2- <dig> complex has been implicated in dna damage response, chromatin structure and transcription  <cit> . in vertebrates, mcm <dig>  may function in elongation during dna replication  <cit> , but in drosophila, mcm <dig>  facilitates crossovers during meiosis  <cit> . a function for mcm <dig> has not been determined.

our phylogenetic analysis reveals that the d. pulex genome contains single copies for each of the eight mcm genes ; d. pulex sequences usually cluster with respective arthropod sequences with strong support. the replicative mcms  share a common ancestor, consistent with the hypothesis that they arose early in eukaryotic evolution  <cit> . the relationships of mcm <dig> and mcm <dig>  are unresolved. within the mcm <dig> clade, the drosophila rec branch is much longer compared to those for other animals. this is consistent with the novel meiotic recombination role for rec in drosophila, compared to the ancestral dna helicase function in vertebrates  <cit> . mcm <dig> has been reported to be vertebrate-specific  <cit> ; however, we found mcm <dig> orthologs in arthropods  including a single copy in d. pulex. for mcm <dig>  arthropod branch lengths are very long compared to those for vertebrates. this could suggest that the invertebrate lineage of mcm9-like proteins has evolved a new function , or simply that mcm <dig> proteins are more widespread in eukaryotes than originally suggested.

timeless  is a circadian rhythm protein in insects  <cit> , while the function of the tim-related protein timeout  has not been clearly defined  <cit> . in mammals, tim and its binding partner, tipin, maintain replication fork integrity during both challenged  and normal dna synthesis  <cit> . in c. elegans, tim physically interacts with smc <dig> of the cohesin complex and directly regulates the loading of cohesin during s-phase  <cit> . genetic screens have also implicated tim and tipin orthologs in meiotic chromosome segregation, although their exact roles are unclear  <cit> .

our phylogeny  clearly distinguishes insect timeless/tim- <dig> and timeout/tim- <dig> lineages and shows non-insect animal tim proteins are homologs of insect timeout/tim- <dig>  consistent with previous results  <cit> . the relationships of the fungal and plant clades of tim-like sequences relative to the animal clades are unclear. it is possible that genes encoding tim- <dig> and tim- <dig> represent an animal-specific duplication in the timeless family. in d. pulex, we found  <dig> genes  with homology to tim-related proteins; among these there are two  timeout/tim- <dig> and nine  timeless/tim- <dig> homologs ; tim-f and tim-g were omitted because they encode very short sequences and were difficult to align. the nine timeless protein homologs  form a strongly-supported clade among the arthropod copies, indicating that multiple timeless/tim- <dig> gene duplications have occurred in the daphnia lineage. this is the first evidence that the timeless/tim- <dig> gene family is present in arthropods other than insects . the d. pulex timeout/tim- <dig> protein homologs  are closely related to each other and to insect timeout homologs; however, tim-b  is much shorter than tim-a .

the recq gene family of dna helicases has conserved roles in dna replication and recombination . unicellular eukaryotes tend to have one recq homolog  while multicellular organisms possess several copies  <cit> . this gene family receives particular attention for its association with human diseases characterized by premature aging, cancer and genomic instability. these syndromes are caused by mutations to recq <dig> , recq <dig>  and recq <dig>   <cit> . recq <dig> is the best-studied member of the recq gene family. recq <dig> proteins  suppress crossing-over during meiotic prophase i and resolve double holliday junctions  without reciprocal recombination  <cit> . the timing and localization of recq <dig> with other proteins involved in meiotic recombination resolution  are consistent with its role in crossover and recombination regulation  <cit> . in d. pulex, we searched for homologs of these five recq gene family members.

the phylogeny of animal and fungal recq protein homologs  shows that d. pulex has single gene copies of recq <dig>  recq <dig> and recq <dig> and several recq <dig> gene homologs  . recq <dig> is absent in d. pulex and may also be absent in other insects. within the recq <dig> lineage, there are two fungal clades, one corresponding to sgs <dig>  and another which a basidiomycete-specific clade of recq <dig> homologs. the unresolved relationships among recq paralogs may require additional sampling of other lineages to determine the order of divergence.

for recq <dig>  d. pulex recq2-a is present within the arthropod recq <dig> clade. the remaining six d. pulex proteins  form a daphnia-specific clade that is sister to other recq <dig> homologs; these proteins are much shorter than recq2-a, and many likely represent pseudogenes . recq2-a contains dexdc, helicase c, rqc and hrdc domains . this, together with expression data  and its phylogenetic position, indicates that recq2-a is likely the functional recq <dig> homolog. the six shorter recq <dig> proteins  only contain the dexdc and helicase c terminal domains, suggestive of roles in rna metabolism. however, the recq2-b gene model  predicts an uncharacteristically large  <dig>  kb gc/ag intron near the 5'-end and much of the translation is unalignable and contains multiple stop codons. est sequences match the region well but continuous orfs are absent, suggesting recq2-b is a pseudogene. recq2-f  is also unusual: this protein has a very long branch in the phylogeny and blast searches suggest strong bacterial homology, although there are apparently numerous introns within the gene. recq2-f is likely a pseudogene, perhaps the result of a prokaryotic horizontal transfer accompanied by intron gain.

d) expression patterns among meiosis-related gene copies
among piwi subfamily members, expression of all d. pulex gene copies is well-supported by cdna and/or tiling path expression data except for protein  <dig>  which is likely encoded by a pseudogene . our rt-pcr expression studies  demonstrate that d. pulex aub-b, aub-c, aub-d and ago <dig> are expressed in males and in ovaries of cyclical and obligate parthenogens while aub-e and aub-f exhibited expression only in ovaries. aub-b, aub-c and ago <dig> were expressed in female soma , in contrast to the situation in most other eukaryotes, in which piwi subfamily gene expression is restricted to germ cells  <cit> . clear roles for this family of proteins in animal meiosis have not been demonstrated .

among the cell cycle proteins, tiling path and/or est evidence showed all cyclin a, b, d and e gene copies are expressed except  <dig>  which is consistent with the idea that this copy is a pseudogene . there is also est and tiling path expression data for all four cdk genes in d. pulex . for plk genes, est and tiling array data show polo-a and polo-b expression in males and in ovaries during meiosis and parthenogenesis . however, only polo-a is expressed in somatic tissue and may therefore represent a "mitotic" copy. for polo-d and polo-e, there is est and tiling expression data and our rt-pcr results show that these genes are expressed in males and in ovaries of obligate and cyclical parthenogens . among the more divergent and truncated plk sequences removed from the phylogenetic analysis , there is est and/or tiling expression evidence for only polo-f, polo-g and polo-h.

among the replication factor genes, expression of all mcm copies is supported by est and tiling path data, except mcm <dig> which only has est data . among the d. pulex timeless/tim- <dig> homologs, there are ests and/or tiling array data for tim-c, tim-i, tim-j and tim-k while only tim-a has tiling path data for the timeout/tim- <dig> homologs. our rt-pcr experiments showed tissue-specific expression patterns for tim-c, tim-d and tim-e; tim-c is expressed in female gonads and soma and in males, tim-d only in female gonads and tim-e in males and female gonads but not soma . such patterns could be consistent with sub-functionalization. the lack of expression for tim-f and tim-g, together with their truncated protein sequences, suggests that these copies are pseudogenes and perhaps remnant duplications of nearby full-length timeless/tim- <dig> genes. est expression evidence for tim-l  indicates this partial gene sequence may retain residual function. there is est and/or tiling expression data for recq <dig>  recq <dig> and recq <dig> in d. pulex. dramatic differences in gene expression of recq <dig>  recq <dig> and recq <dig> in d. pulex were not observed; rt-pcr showed these genes were expressed in parthenogenetic  females, males and female soma. for recq <dig> copies, est and/or tiling array data shows that recq2-a, rec2q-b and rec2q-c are expressed . however, rt-pcr shows that recq2-a is expressed in soma and during obligate parthenogenesis and meiosis, while recq2-b and recq2-care only expressed in female gonads .

ii) meiosis-specific genes
genes that are meiosis-specific have been experimentally shown to be indispensable for and generally expressed only during meiosis in model organisms  <cit> , but otherwise not to affect organismal viability. determining the presence and absence of genes that encode proteins functioning only in meiosis will help us to understand the mechanisms of meiosis in d. pulex. we have divided the meiosis-specific genes in this study into three broad categories based on their roles in i) sister chromatid cohesion , ii) meiotic interhomolog recombination  and iii) crossover control/resolution . in addition, we search for genes encoding rad54/rad54b, stromal antigens and eukaryotic mutl homologs , which, while not meiosis-specific, are initially involved in meiotic processes.

a) cohesin gene families: smcs, rad21/rec <dig> and stromal antigens
cohesin is a multi-protein complex that maintains sister chromatid cohesion until the onset of anaphase in mitosis and meiosis. cohesin complexes consist of smc <dig> and smc <dig> , rad <dig>  or its meiosis-specific paralog rec <dig>  and the stromal antigen protein  . in one well-supported model, rad21/rec <dig> binds the globular atpase ends of smc <dig> and smc <dig>  joining them together in a ring-like structure  <cit> . the specific roles of sa proteins are less well understood  <cit> .

cohesin is normally loaded onto chromosomes during s-phase  <cit> , although it can also bind to chromosomes independently of dna replication in response to dsb-induced damage after s-phase  <cit> . removal of cohesin is generally a two-step process. during vertebrate mitosis, dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms depends on phosphorylation by the protein kinases plk <dig>  <cit>  and aurora-b  <cit> . centromeric cohesin is removed by separase cleavage of rad <dig> in a securin-dependent manner which allows anaphase to proceed  <cit> . during meiosis, rad <dig> is largely replaced by its meiosis-specific paralog rec <dig>  <cit> ; the majority of cohesin along chromosome arms is removed by separase during meiosis i, but centromeric cohesin is protected from cleavage by shugoshin  <cit> . this protection disappears during meiosis ii when separase cleaves centromeric rec <dig> and cohesin is released, allowing sister chromatids to segregate to opposite poles. for d. pulex, we searched for genes encoding smc <dig>  smc <dig>  rad <dig>  rec <dig> and sa proteins. sequences for cohesin accessory factors pds <dig>  <cit> , separase, securin and shugoshin are generally poorly conserved in eukaryotes and were not included .

in eukaryotes, the smc family of proteins contains six members  that combine to form heterodimeric complexes. smc proteins are characterized by two nucleotide binding walker motifs  within globular n and c-termini which are separated by a pair of acidic coiled-coil regions joined at the non-helical "hinge" region. cohesin proteins contain smc <dig> and smc <dig>  while smc <dig> and smc <dig>  are part of a dna repair complex with checkpoint function  <cit> . condensin complexes contain smc <dig> and smc <dig>  and are involved in chromosome condensation and segregation  <cit>  and in sister kinetochore orientation  <cit> . in animals and plants, two different condensin complexes  possess the same core subunits but are distinguished by their regulatory subunits  <cit> .

the phylogeny of animal and fungal smc homologs reveals that each smc protein forms a strongly-supported clade . there is strong support for a duplication that gave rise to the smc1/ <dig> lineage, but weaker support for the smc2/ <dig> duplication. smc <dig> and smc <dig> form a separate group and longer branch lengths compared to other smcs, suggesting a rapid rate of evolution, which could be related to their unique roles in dna repair and cell cycle checkpoints. indeed, smc <dig> and smc <dig> in drosophila may be under relaxed selection, since they experience higher amino acid substitution rates compared to other smcs  <cit> .

in d. pulex, there are single copies of genes encoding smc <dig>  smc <dig> and smc <dig> proteins. smc <dig> and smc <dig> are closely related to arthropod copies, but smc <dig>  is quite divergent and appears as the basal branch among animal smc <dig> homologs . there are also duplications of genes for smc <dig> , smc <dig>  and smc <dig>  in d. pulex. the smc <dig> duplication in d. pulex is independent of the vertebrate smc <dig> duplication that gave rise to meiosis-specific smc1β  <cit> . smc1a and smc1b are on different scaffolds  while smc6a and smc6b are  <dig> kb apart on scaffold  <dig> , perhaps the result of an ancient tandem duplication. smc3a and smc3b are distantly related to one another; smc3b has a longer branch and is present outside of the metazoan/fungal smc <dig> clade along with a duplicated smc <dig> from anopheles. genes for smc3a and smc3b differ dramatically in exon composition  but both copies contain a central hinge domain flanked by conserved n- and c-terminal atpases. these divergent smc <dig> copies in d. pulex and anopheles may represent paralogs that have gained unique cellular function; further taxon sampling across all eukaryotes can address this question. we also found nine short protein sequences in d. pulex  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> aa which, based on blast search results, represent short domains within smc <dig> that have been copied and dispersed throughout the genome. these short coding regions are not generally transcribed, although some loci are imperfect matches for ests from the sequenced libraries. further comparative sequencing and examination of their expression patterns may reveal potential regulatory or functional roles for these small genes.

in the rad <dig> and rec <dig> phylogeny, homologs for each protein form strongly supported clades . for d. pulex, there is one rad <dig> homolog and three genes copies encoding meiosis-specific rec <dig> , which are closely related to other arthropod sequences. in animals, rad <dig> and rec <dig> are typically present as single copies although there are exceptions . for d. pulex, rec8a is on scaffold  <dig> while rec8b and rec8c are found in a head-to-head orientation on scaffold  <dig> separated by about  <dig> kb and likely represent a very recent tandem duplication . rec <dig> copies on scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> are also very similar . we cloned and sequenced rec <dig> from cdna and corrected inaccurate gene models  <dig> and  <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  and model  <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  our cdna sequence indicates a protein containing  <dig> exons comprising  <dig>  nucleotides and  <dig> amino acids. in addition, we found two different regions, one downstream of rec8a and one in between rec8b and rec8c, that each contains distinct sequences found many times within the d. pulex genome. neither region has expression evidence or encodes orfs, but appear to correspond to repetitive dnas found at dozens of locations throughout the genome .

for the sa gene family, there have been multiple independent duplications during eukaryotic evolution. in vertebrates, at least two duplications gave rise to stag- <dig>  stag- <dig> and meiosis-specific stag- <dig> paralogs  <cit>  and an independent duplication in drosophila resulted in sa and meiosis-specific snm paralogs  <cit> . in fungi, only s. pombe shows evidence of an scc <dig> duplication . in the sa protein phylogeny , animal, fungal and plant sa homologs form independent clades and the gene duplications specific to vertebrates , drosophila  and s. pombe  are evident. in d. pulex, there are five sa homologs  that form a clade closely related to arthropods. two pairs of the daphnia sa genes  are in a tandem duplication on scaffold  <dig>  while the fifth copy  is on scaffold  <dig>  this sa gene expansion in daphnia is the largest example characterized in eukaryotes; thus, an obvious question is whether one of the copies has a meiosis- or parthenogenesis-specific role .

b) interhomolog recombination genes
meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes begins with the creation of double strand breaks  to initiate chromosomal synapsis and subsequent interhomolog crossing-over. spo <dig>  the eukaryotic homolog of an archaeal topoisomerase vi subunit  <cit> , is a trans-esterase that creates these dsbs  <cit> . spo <dig> appears to be indispensable for meiosis since homologs have been found in all eukaryotes examined to date  <cit> . d. pulex has one spo <dig> homolog which is present between the arthropod and vertebrate spo <dig> clades in the phylogeny .

following dsb formation, several meiosis-specific proteins act in concert to promote chromosomal synapsis and recombination. genes encoding meiosis-specific proteins in our inventory are dmc <dig> , mnd <dig>  and hop2; we also include rad <dig> and its meiotic paralog rad54b . rad <dig> and dmc <dig> are the two major eukaryotic homologs of eubacterial reca  <cit> . rad <dig> is required for mitotic recombination, dna damage repair and meiotic recombination, while dmc <dig> is meiosis-specific, required only for meiotic recombination and for normal synaptonemal complex  formation  <cit> . rad <dig> and dmc <dig> co-localize during meiosis and work together during meiotic recombination  <cit> . mnd <dig> and hop <dig> form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with rad <dig> and dmc <dig> to promote interhomolog meiotic recombination and to reduce synapsis and recombination of non-homologous chromosomes  <cit> . rad54b  interacts with rad <dig> during meiosis to stimulate d-loop formation by rad <dig>  <cit>  and helps to stabilize the dmc1-ssdna complex in humans  <cit> . while these proteins are meiosis-specific, non-meiotic expression has been detected for mnd <dig>  hop <dig> and rad54b, but only in some mammals  <cit> .

there are single copies of genes for mnd <dig> and hop <dig> in d. pulex . the phylogenies  show d. pulex mnd <dig> and hop <dig> proteins are closely related to their respective homologs in arthropods. single copies of genes for rad <dig> and rad54b are present in d. pulex . in the phylogeny, d. pulex rad <dig>  is present among animal orthologs but does not show a strong relationship to arthropods. rad54b  appears to have been lost in insects, so the presence of this gene in d. pulex suggests the loss might not be widespread in arthropods.

with genes encoding mnd <dig>  hop <dig>  rad <dig>  and rad54b present in d. pulex, genes for rad <dig> and dmc <dig> are expected to also be present due to the important interactions among these proteins in meiosis. while a single rad <dig> homolog is present in d. pulex, meiosis-specific dmc <dig> appears to be absent . to address the possibility that the daphnia dmc <dig> homolog was simply overlooked in the d. pulex genome database, we searched d. pulex ests at wfleabase  <cit>  but did not find dmc <dig> transcripts. attempts to amplify dmc <dig> from d. pulex using degenerate pcr with primers that amplify dmc <dig>  in a wide diversity of eukaryotes  were also unsuccessful. lastly, we searched for other eukaryotic rad51-like family members  that are more distantly related than dmc <dig> to rad <dig>  <cit> . if we could identify these more distantly related and divergent protein sequences, then we should be able to find the gene for dmc <dig> if it is indeed present. single copies of genes for xrcc <dig>  rad51c and rad51d were found in d. pulex , although rad51b  and xrcc <dig> appear to be absent. this strengthens the validity of the dmc <dig> absence in d. pulex and it is unlikely that a cryptic unsequenced or unassembled copy remains to be found.

the absence of dmc <dig> is scattered, but not widespread throughout arthropods; dmc <dig> homologs are absent in drosophila and anopheles  <cit> , but present in the insects bombyx, tribolium and rhipicephalus . determining the ubiquity of the dmc <dig> loss within branchiopods, crustacea and arthropods will shed light on the evolution of the machinery for homologous recombination in meiosis and possibly cyclical parthenogenesis. among taxa with sequenced genomes, the only other case where dmc <dig> is absent while rad <dig>  mnd <dig> and hop <dig> are present is the microsporidian fungus encephalitozoon  <cit> . however, little is known about microsporidian meiosis so the implications of the dmc <dig> loss are unclear. similarly, meiosis and parthenogenesis in d. pulex are not fully understood so this result certainly merits further investigation.

c) mismatch repair genes: muts and mutl homologs
the eukaryotic homologs of bacterial muts and mutl proteins form heterodimers that are involved in chromosomal synapsis, recombination and mismatch repair . in eukaryotes, there are up to seven muts homologs ; we did not search for msh <dig>  and msh <dig>  in d. pulex . msh <dig> forms heterodimers with msh <dig> and msh <dig>  msh2/msh <dig>  tends to be the most abundant muts heterodimer and is involved in the repair of short base-base mismatches and indels while msh2/msh <dig>  repairs longer mismatches . the msh4/msh <dig> heteroduplex is meiosis-specific and has a unique function among eukaryotic muts homologs in recognizing holliday junctions and stabilizing heteroduplex formation during meiotic crossing-over and recombination  <cit> . msh <dig> has also been shown to interact with rad <dig> and dmc <dig> in mammalian meiosis  <cit> .

the phylogeny of animal and fungal muts homologs reveals five strongly-supported clades specific for each msh gene . the topology is consistent with other phylogenies that group these five msh genes together  <cit> . our phylogeny supports the idea that separate duplications yielded the msh3/ <dig> and msh2/4/ <dig> lineages  <cit> , although the exact branching order of the msh <dig>  msh <dig> and msh <dig> clades is not resolved. single copies of genes for each muts homolog are present in d. pulex, including the meiosis-specific msh <dig> and msh <dig> . this shows the msh <dig> and msh <dig> loss in drosophila is not widespread in arthropods since orthologs are present in d. pulex and in other insects . the presence of msh <dig> in d. pulex and the basal metazoan nematostella indicates that msh <dig> may have been lost in insects but retained in other arthropods and animals. further taxon sampling in arthropods and other invertebrates is necessary to understand the extent of this gene loss. although two additional partial "copies" of msh <dig> on scaffold  <dig> can be identified by blast, these most likely are mis-assemblies because they are truncated proteins flanked by repeats and they are 100% identical to protein  <dig> 

there are four eukaryotic homologs of bacterial mutl genes: mlh <dig>  mlh <dig>  mlh <dig> and pms <dig> . mutl homologs form three heterodimers in which mlh <dig> is the common subunit  <cit> . mlh1/pms <dig>  is the most abundant heterodimer in human mitotic cells  <cit>  and functions in mmr  <cit> , but also has a role in meiotic recombination  <cit> . the role of mlh1/mlh <dig>  in mmr is not well understood, while mlh1/mlh <dig>  is involved in meiotic recombination  <cit>  and mmr in vitro  <cit> .

in the animal and fungal mlh phylogeny , four clades are resolved, one for each mlh gene. three clades  are strongly supported but the overall branching order for mlh <dig>  mlh <dig>  mlh <dig> and pms <dig> is unresolved. weaker support for the mlh <dig> animal/fungal clade is likely due to rapidly evolving fungal sequences; when they are removed all four mlh clades are strongly supported . in d. pulex, there are single copies of each mlh homolog . the mlh <dig> copy  is present within the mlh <dig> clade but does not show a strong relationship to other animals; however, neither do the other arthropod mlh <dig> sequences. mlh <dig> and mlh <dig> have been lost from the insects examined but are present in d. pulex and nematostella, suggesting independent losses of these genes in insects. thus, while insects are unable to form mutl-β or mutl-γ heterodimers, they can presumably still produce mutl-α, which is the most abundant and may have a minor role in meiotic recombination.

d) expression patterns for meiosis-specific genes
among the cohesin genes in d. pulex, est and/or tiling array data provide evidence for expression of smc <dig> and smc <dig> copies , for rad <dig> and the three rec <dig> copies and for all five sa copies. our rt-pcr results show the three rec <dig> copies are expressed in ovaries of both parthenogenetic cultures and in males, but not in female soma . for the sa genes, we also found expression evidence for sa-a, sa-b and sa-c by rt-pcr in female gonads and soma and in males  but no expression for sa-d or sa-e.

among the interhomolog recombination genes, tiling array expression data validates the gene model for spo <dig> in d. pulex. we also detected spo <dig> transcription in males and in ovaries of both cyclical and obligate asexuals, but not in female soma . there is also expression evidence for mnd <dig> and hop <dig> from est and/or tiling arrays . our rt-pcr experiments also show mnd <dig> and hop <dig> expression in cyclical and obligate parthenogens, but mnd <dig> was also expressed in males and in female soma. this result, together with non-meiotic expression of mnd <dig> and hop <dig> in some mammals  <cit> , could suggest these genes are constitutively expressed in some species, either because they have an uncharacterized non-meiotic role or they are nonspecifically expressed at low levels. there is tiling array and/or est expression data in d. pulex for all five msh genes, for each mlh homolog, and for rad <dig> and rad54b . rt-pcr for msh <dig> and msh <dig> show that these genes are expressed during cyclical and obligate parthenogenesis and also in males; only msh <dig> expression was detected in female soma.

CONCLUSIONS
a role for meiotic genes in parthenogenesis?
the main objective of our meiotic gene inventory is to determine which genes necessary for meiosis are present in d. pulex. this information, along with gene expression patterns, can then be used to illuminate mechanistic differences between meiosis and both cyclical and obligate parthenogenesis in d. pulex. we emphasize that differences between parthenogenesis and meiosis are likely to relate to changes in: i) kinetochore orientation, ii) recombination bias and iii) sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> . from our gene inventory, the majority of meiotic genes are present in multiple copies in d. pulex , which is also consistent with the high tandem gene content characteristic of the d. pulex genome. we speculate that these extra gene copies may be partly responsible for changes to these meiotic processes, as suggested by our model for parthenogenesis . we suggest that some of these duplicated genes have the potential to serve parthenogenesis-specific functions, although it is possible that some duplicate gene copies have maintained their ancestral meiotic function. below, we discuss implications that our meiotic gene inventory and expression data may have on understanding the mechanisms of parthenogenesis in d. pulex. we also incorporate these findings into a model highlighting the stages in meiosis where these genes could play important roles in the transition from meiosis to parthenogenesis.

according to our model , stem cell division and maintenance are similar in meiosis and parthenogenesis. however, we invoke important changes in heterochromatin formation  and kinetochore attachment during parthenogenesis. piwi subfamily proteins affect heterochromatin assembly and in d. pulex there are six piwi subfamily gene copies , including two copies  expressed in ovaries but not in males or soma. comparisons of expression patterns for these gene copies during meiosis and parthenogenesis may indicate potentially important roles for this protein family in both meiosis and parthenogenetic reproduction.

polo kinases  have diverse roles in meiosis and also in regulating the cell cycle, kinetochore formation and cohesin attachment and removal. d. pulex has at least three copies of plk <dig> and several partial plk1-like sequences. plk <dig> is involved in orienting kinetochores during mitosis and meiosis. in d. pulex some plk <dig> copies may be involved in altering microtubule attachment during parthenogenesis to allow amphitelic  rather than syntelic  attachment of kinetochores . genes encoding some proteins that plk <dig> interacts with are also present in multiple copies in d. pulex: plk <dig> together with cyclin b  affects cell cycle regulation  <cit> . since parthenogenesis in d. pulex is distinct from mitosis and meiosis, parthenogenetic cell cycle regulation may require interactions between specific cell cycle proteins  for successful cytokinesis.

according to our model, parthenogenetic sister chromatid cohesion must differ from cohesion during regular meiosis. the stepwise removal of cohesin in mitosis requires plk <dig> to phosphorylate the sa subunit ; changes in the timing of cohesin removal during parthenogenesis could be achieved by the activity of a "parthenogenetic" plk <dig> copy that phosphorylates sa  in a mitotic rather than meiotic fashion. parthenogenetic-specific copies of timeless/tim- <dig> and timeout/tim- <dig> may also be involved in the initial loading of cohesin during meiosis and parthenogenesis, as demonstrated in c. elegans for tim- <dig>  <cit> . distinct parthenogenetic cohesin complexes might also be present in d. pulex. if so, we would expect to find multiple copies of genes encoding cohesin complex proteins and those that are involved in its loading, targeting, and removal from chromosomes. in d. pulex, there are two gene copies each for smc <dig> and smc <dig> proteins which could represent the gain of a parthenogenesis-specific function in one copy . there are also three copies of meiosis-specific rec <dig> and only one copy of its paralog rad <dig>  some rec <dig> copies may be involved in differential regulation of cohesin removal  in parthenogenesis compared to meiosis. however, such divergent roles for rec <dig> are unknown; for example, three rec <dig> copies are also present in c. elegans, but their functional differences have not been extensively characterized  <cit> .

the richness of cohesin complex genes in d. pulex is unique among eukaryotes. we speculate that the extra gene copies encode proteins that are involved in altering sister chromatid cohesion during parthenogenesis. combinations of the various smc <dig>  smc <dig>  rec <dig> and sa copies could plausibly comprise different cohesin complexes with specific roles in meiosis and parthenogenesis. for example, our model for parthenogenesis posits meiosis-like cohesion during prophase  followed by a shift in favor of the function of the "parthenogenetic" cohesin . at this point, centromeric cohesin would be released and sister chromatids, instead of homologs, would segregate, recapitulating the maternal genotype in the daughter cells in a mitosis-like division. this intriguing prospect will require detailed genetic screening to determine the functions of these genes. alternatively, a parthenogenetic-specific cohesin might not replace rad <dig> with rec8; during meiosis in rec8Δ yeast, rad <dig> cohesin can establish amphitelic kinetochore attachment and loss of centromeric cohesin during anaphase i  <cit> . in essence, this resembles a mitotic division during meiosis i as suggested in our model for parthenogenesis. however, all three copies of rec <dig> are expressed during parthenogenesis , so while some, or all, copies are likely involved in this process, rad <dig> may also play an important role.

our model also suggests that during parthenogenesis there is a change in recombination bias from between homologs to either between sister chromatids, or to no homologous recombination at all. this idea is supported by a study of mutation-accumulation lines in d. pulex showing that the loss of heterozygosity by ameiotic recombination was orders of magnitude greater than nucleotide mutation rates  <cit> ; this clearly indicates that some degree of non-reciprocal recombination normally occurs during parthenogenetic reproduction. in our survey, the majority of genes involved in dsb formation, recombination initiation, promoting strand invasion and resolving holliday junctions  are present as single copies. this pattern implies that a parthenogenesis-specific function for these proteins is unlikely, or alternatively that the proteins do not function during parthenogenesis at all. the lack of variation in copy number of genes involved in hr and mmr may also reflect the importance of these pathways for the survival of d. pulex. conversely, there are seven gene copies homologous to recq <dig>  which encodes a protein that limits crossing over and promotes holliday junction resolution without reciprocal exchange. this contrast is striking: genes encoding proteins that promote meiotic recombination are present as single copies while a protein that suppresses crossing-over has seven gene copies. this may help to explain how meiotic recombination could be suppressed or altered during parthenogenesis. for example, if the single-copy genes maintain their function in meiosis  while others such as recq <dig> copies have evolved novel roles unique to parthenogenesis, the result could be decreased levels or the absence of reciprocal recombination during parthenogenesis as predicted in our model.

the absence of meiosis-specific dmc <dig> could also have implications regarding innovations for recombination in meiosis and parthenogenesis in d. pulex. increased frequency of interhomolog over intersister recombination is a defining characteristic of meiosis, a bias which is strongly enforced by dmc <dig>  <cit> . thus, d. pulex has the machinery for synapsis but is missing the recombinase  typically associated with this system. however, other meiotically competent animals missing dmc <dig>  in addition to mnd <dig> and hop <dig> , have presumably evolved unique innovations  to compensate for the absence of these genes. another possibility for d. pulex is the promotion of homolog bias during meiosis by the sc. although well-conserved structurally, the rapid evolution of sc proteins  make them difficult to identify. further study of synapsis and recombination control in daphnia provides an interesting comparative system to better understand these processes in animals.

our rt-pcr with d. pulex cultures detected expression for  <dig> meiotic gene copies during oogenesis in cyclical parthenogenetic cultures and also during both sexual and obligate asexual reproduction and in female soma . initially, we found that presence and absence of  <dig> meiotic genes during meiosis  and parthenogenesis  in a cyclically parthenogenetic culture were indistinguishable. that is, gene expression specific to either meiosis or direct developing egg production  was not observed for these genes . in addition, our rt-pcr experiments in cyclical and obligate parthenogenetic cultures for the > <dig> genes that we subjected to more detailed phylogenetic analyses  did not detect expression specific to sexual tissues  or obligate asexual tissues . several genes were found to have expression restricted to the germline or soma.

however, transcript levels may not be an accurate measure of protein function during parthenogenesis, and although meiosis genes are expressed during parthenogenesis, it is possible that their function is altered or absent. expression patterns were also not determined for all gene copies in this study, so perhaps some of these may exhibit parthenogenesis-specific expression patterns when examined more closely. in addition, mature and immature oocyte clusters can exist within the same ovary, yet be undergoing two different reproductive modes . thus, a technique with increased spatial resolution, such as in situ hybridization, may be required to detect qualitatively important differences in expression. yet, many gene copies were expressed in ovaries undergoing either obligate parthenogenesis or meiosis, indicating that these genes could function during both processes. there were also several genes expressed in female soma. interestingly, expression of mnd <dig> and msh <dig> in female soma could indicate that these genes are not meiosis-specific and may have uncharacterized non-meiotic  role. this could also represent low level constitutive expression, as non-meiotic gene expression has been detected for mnd <dig>  in mammals  <cit> . among genes not expressed, polo-j, polo-k, recq2-b, tim-f and tim-g are likely pseudogenes based on both lack of expression and other characteristics in gene architecture . est and/or tiling array expression evidence for recq2-b, recq2-c, polo-f, sa-d and sa-e contradicts the absence of expression from our rt-pcr results, although the causes of these discrepancies are unclear.

comparative data from other daphnia species and parthenogenetic taxa will help to clarify the deeper history of reproductive gene duplications in this genus. apis mellifera  is the only other animal in our phylogenetic analyses that regularly undergoes parthenogenesis and that also has an assembled genome. the genome of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum is currently being sequenced, and it will be most interesting to compare the meiotic gene inventory of this cyclical parthenogen to that of d. pulex. reproduction in apis  is arrhenotokous, meaning haploid males are parthenogenetically produced while fertilized eggs turn into diploid females. this differs from cyclical parthenogenesis  in daphnia which alternates between parthenogenesis  and sexual reproduction. we did not find any striking expansions in gene copy number or conspicuous gene absences in our survey of meiotic genes in apis. thus, while both taxa have parthenogenetic phases of their life cycles, the meiotic gene catalog in d. pulex is markedly enriched for gene duplications compared to apis. whether this is mechanistically or causally related to differences between cyclical parthenogenesis and arrhenotoky is unclear.

our meiotic gene inventory has identified expansions in particular meiotic genes and gene families that we speculate are related to the mechanism of parthenogenesis in d. pulex. from our analysis, we cannot make substantial conclusions on parthenogenetic-specific functions for these gene copies without extensive expression and functional assays in d. pulex. however, considering the multi-functional roles of many of the proteins in our inventory , the acquisition of an additional yet-to-be characterized parthenogenetic-specific function would not be unreasonable to consider. it is clear that tandem duplications are widespread in the d. pulex genome and to a much greater extent than other sequenced invertebrates. however, at this point we cannot distinguish whether tandem duplications are the consequence or cause of parthenogenesis. for example, if cyclical parthenogenesis has a higher rate of unequal crossing over or slip-strand mispairing than does meiosis, the consequence could be a higher frequency of tandem duplications during parthenogenesis; thus, a large proportion of duplicate genes would be expected to have arisen since the origin of parthenogenesis in this species. alternatively, duplicated meiotic genes might be the cause of parthenogenesis by driving the genetic sub-functionalization of different biochemical activities associated with parthenogenetic production of either direct-developing  or diapause  oocytes.

one approach to resolving the issue of cause or effect would be to date the duplications by comparing the relative ages of tandem gene pairs in daphnia associated with meiosis to the ages of tandem duplicate genes not associated with meiosis. if gene families associated with meiosis have a significantly older distribution than gene families that are not, this would indicate that meiotic gene duplications preceded the origin of parthenogenesis, while a younger age would suggest that duplications of meiotic genes have been a consequence of parthenogenesis. one way to accomplish this is to complete a phylogenetic survey of duplicated meiotic genes throughout the cladocera, all of which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis, and in the clam shrimp cyclestheria which may represent the closest extant representative of the lineage from which cladocerans arose  <cit> . if multiple meiotic gene copies are also present throughout cladocera and in cyclestheria then this would suggest meiotic gene duplications might have coincided with the origin of cyclical parthenogenesis and indicate the minimum complement of duplicated meiotic genes that are required for cyclical parthenogenesis. a sporadic distribution of duplicated genes could suggest ancestral duplications and multiple losses or independent origins of duplicated gene. such studies require an in-depth analysis of the age distribution of gene duplications, tandem and otherwise, which is outside the scope of this report.
