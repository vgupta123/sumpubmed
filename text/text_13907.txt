BACKGROUND
stripe rust, caused by the fungus puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , is one of the most destructive diseases affecting wheat  in many regions of the world. in china, stripe rust infects millions of hectares of wheat annually  <cit> , causing large yield losses over the past two decades due to the emergence of new virulent races in the fungus population  <cit> .

as a foliar disease, stripe rust has a considerable effect on grain yield, depending on the disease response  <cit>  and the host growth stage at which pst infection is initiated  <cit> . stripe rust epidemics can begin at any growth stage in wheat  <cit> , and therefore, they have a marked effect on plant vigor in addition to grain yield  <cit> . severe stripe rust infection also alters the distribution of assimilates among the various organs of the plant  <cit> .

stripe rust infection is closely linked to both leaf photosynthesis and senescence, and many of the expressed sequence tags  induced by puccinia striiformis are related to those two processes . a recent study in wheat showed that the senescence-associated gene  tasag <dig> plays an important role in the defense against stripe rust  <cit> . in addition, the multi-gene pathogen resistance factor ‘lr34/yr18/pm38’ involves leaf senescence  <cit> . these findings imply that senescence-and photosynthesis-related processes might be part of the resistance response to stripe rust infection.

wheat line l <dig>  is from f6: <dig> families of a cross between my <dig> and yu <dig>  the latter being a derivative of a wide cross involving thinopyrum intermedium  <cit> . genetic analysis demonstrated that stripe rust resistance observed in l <dig> is conferred by a single dominant gene, yrl <dig>  which was mapped to chromosome 1b by linkage analysis with simple sequence repeat  markers and chinese spring nulli-tetrasomic lines  <cit> . although the pedigree of l <dig> includes th. intermedium, the question of whether yrl <dig> is derived directly from th. intermedium remains unanswered.

the objectives of the present study were to assess whether resistant plants maintained the normal timing of leaf senescence during grain filling and to examine the physiological effects of any leaf senescence traits that were affected by infection. we also explored the molecular mechanism of resistance to stripe rust in wheat and attempted to determine the origin of yrl <dig> by high-density mapping and comparative genomic analysis. we demonstrated that it is possible to map resistance genes using the identified ests between isogenic lines after pathogen infection, and we outline a putative novel genetic mechanism of resistance conferred by this gene.

RESULTS
identification of unique ests induced by pst infection
l <dig> was highly resistant and l <dig> highly susceptible to pst race cyr <dig> . the response tests performed at the adult  and seedling stages  showed similar results. random sequencing of bacterial colonies from the suppression subtractive hybridization  library identified  <dig> ests, with an average length of  <dig> bp, which were submitted to ncbi under the accession numbers  though  and  through  . of these,  <dig> unique ests  with an average length of  <dig> bp , including  <dig> contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp and  <dig> singletons with an average length of  <dig> bp, were found. most of the uniests were between  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length  and were further identified through clustering and assembly of putative full-length cdnas based on the blast analysis option in ncbi genbank .fig.  <dig> seedling  and adult  responses to a) l <dig>  b) l <dig>  c) l <dig>  d) l <dig>  c functional classes of differentially expressed sequences induced by pst inoculation

both l <dig> and l <dig> were sampled  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after inoculation with pst cyr <dig>  cdna prepared from l <dig> leaves infected with pst cyr <dig> was used as the tester, and cdna prepared from l <dig> leaves infected with pst cyr <dig> was used as the driver



functional categorization of the ests, as well as gene network analysis, predicted that pst infection in l <dig> induces differential regulation of leaf senescence-associated-genes .

of the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> showed high sequence similarity to known or annotated genes from cdna libraries from wheat, rice, barley, pea and arabidopsis thaliana . of the genes that were upregulated in l <dig>   <dig> % were involved in photosynthesis-like and leaf senescence-like pathways,  <dig> % in cellular process pathways,  <dig> % in protein biosynthesis pathways,  <dig> % in the hydrolase pathway,  <dig> % in the oxidoreduction pathway,  <dig> % in the transmembrane transport pathway,  <dig> % in the electron transport pathway, and  <dig> % in glycolysis. the remaining  <dig>  of upregulated sequences had unspecified or unknown functions,  <dig> of which closely matched the sequences of putative senescence-associated genes .

polymorphisms between ests and linkage analysis of stripe rust resistance
out of  <dig> primers designed, one primer pair   produced polymorphic amplicons between l <dig> and l <dig> as well as between the resistant parent yu <dig> and the susceptible parent my <dig> . the design of the ls <dig> primers was from the sequence of , which we mapped to wheat chromosome 1a by in silico mapping. the l <dig>  l <dig>  yu <dig> and my <dig> lines produced two amplicons, one  <dig> bp amplicon, which was the same among all genotypes, and a second amplicon that was polymorphic between l <dig> and l <dig> and between yu <dig> and my <dig>  in l <dig> and susceptible parents my <dig> and cm <dig>  this amplicon was  <dig> bp, and in the resistant lines l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  as well as yu <dig> and sister line yu <dig>  the amplicon was  <dig> bp. amplification of genomic dna from the nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines  revealed that the amplicon common among all lines and cs was absent in the nullisomic 1a lines .fig.  <dig> identification of polymorphism between stripe rust-resistant and stripe rust-susceptible genotypes. the ls <dig> primer designed from an est sequence  produced polymorphic amplicons among the various genotypes. a a  <dig> bp amplicon was amplified in the susceptible l <dig> line and its susceptible parents my <dig> and cm <dig>  a  <dig> bp amplicon was amplified in resistant l <dig> line, resistant sister lines l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig>  and their resistant parent, yu <dig>  a  <dig> bp amplicon was also amplified from yu <dig>  one of the resistant sister lines of yu <dig>  a  <dig> bp fragment was amplified in all genotypes. b chromosomal localizations of the amplicons that were polymorphic between l <dig> and l <dig>  with cs nulli-tetrasomic lines of homoeologous group  <dig> and ditelosomic lines of wheat chromosome 1b. pcr was performed to map the gene using genomic dna from the cs and various aneuploids. pcr products were resolved on  <dig> % polyacrylamide gels. no pcr product was generated from nullisomic 1b  or the ditelosomic 1bs  lines. c silver-stained polyacrylamide gels showing polymorphic markers generated using the lsc <dig> primer linked to the stripe rust resistance gene in l <dig>  l <dig>  susceptible parent; l <dig>  resistant parent; r <dig> and r <dig>  resistant f <dig> individuals; br, the resistant f <dig> dna pool; h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  resistant f <dig> individuals; s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  susceptible f <dig> individuals; bs, the susceptible f <dig> dna pool. l <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and bs showed amplification of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp fragments; l <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and br showed amplification of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp fragments; h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> showed amplification of all three fragments, indicating heterozygosity



the polymorphic  <dig> bp amplicon was located on chromosome arm 1bl, as no pcr products were generated from the nullisomic 1b lines  or the ditelosomic 1bs line . sequencing of the polymorphic amplicon found that there was an extra repeat of  <dig> bp sequence in the susceptible allele compared with the resistant allele. sequence similarity searches with the polymorphic amplicon found a contig  with high sequence similarity located on wheat chromosome 1b.

we designed four pairs of primers for linkage analysis based on differences in the number of copies of the  <dig> bp sequence . analysis using the lsc <dig> primer pair  detected a  <dig> bp product closely linked to the yrl <dig> resistance gene in l <dig>  analysis of  <dig> f2: <dig> lines with additional primer pairs  further demonstrated a co-dominant marker on chromosome 1b co-segregating with yrl <dig> 

fine mapping and comparative genomic analysis of wcbp <dig> indicated that it co-segregated with yrl693
genomic in situ hybridization  failed to detect an alien chromosome segment from th. intermedium in l <dig> . a high-density integrated genetic map was constructed . the linkage map consisted of nine ssr markers and eight est-sts markers . the wcbp <dig> locus fell within a genetic interval of  <dig>  cm. wcbp <dig> co-segregated with the yrl <dig> locus. two flanking est-sts markers, bf <dig> and be <dig>  were linked to the wcpb <dig> locus at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively, and mapped to the chromosome 1b bin c–1bl-6- <dig> . therefore, wcbp <dig> is located in the same chromosomal region as yrl <dig>  the contigs of the two ssr markers xwmc269-1b and xcfd65-1b on one side of wcbp <dig> mapped to wheat chromosomal arm 1bl, whereas those of the seven other ssr markers on the other side of wcbp <dig> mapped to 1bs according to the published ssr linkage map  <cit> .fig.  <dig> genetic and comparative genomic linkage map of the candidate gene wcbp <dig> and yrl <dig>  a physical bin map of wcpb1; wcbp <dig> was mapped to the bin c-1bl6- <dig> . b genetic map of wcbp <dig> with a total length of  <dig>  cm on wheat chromosome 1b. the genetic distance in cm is shown on the left and genetic markers are shown on the right. c the consensus ssr map for a total of  <dig>  cm of wheat chromosome 1b. d, e, f, orthologous regions of wcbp <dig> in brachypodium distachyon chromosome  <dig>  and oryza sativa japonica chromosome  <dig>  and sorghum bicolor chromosome  <dig>  respectively



orthologs of wheat ests be <dig> and be <dig> were detected on b. distachyon chromosome  <dig>  rice chromosome  <dig>  and sorghum chromosome  <dig>  comparative genomic analysis established the collinearity of wcbp <dig> genomic regions with a  <dig>  mb  region on b. distachyon chromosome  <dig>  a  <dig>  mb region  on rice chromosome  <dig>  and a  <dig>  mb region  on sorghum chromosome  <dig>  regions that carry  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, respectively. the gene order was highly conserved among wheat, b. distachyon, and rice , but showed an intra-chromosomal inversion in the  <dig>  mb chromosome region of sorghum. we also found an orthologous genomic region  of wheat contig 1bs- <dig> carrying the ssr marker xgwm18-1b at  <dig>  mb on b. distachyon chromosome  <dig> , but there was no corresponding ortholog in either rice or sorghum . an ortholog of wcbp <dig> was found on bradi3g <dig>  at  <dig> mb on b. distachyon chromosome  <dig>  on os10g <dig>  at  <dig> mb on rice chromosome  <dig>  and on sb01g <dig>  at  <dig>  mb on sorghum chromosome  <dig> .fig.  <dig> comparative genomic mapping of ests in the wcbp <dig>  chromosomal region of wheat chromosome 1b  with brachypodium distachyon chromosome  <dig> , oryza sativa japonica chromosome  <dig> , and sorghum bicolor chromosome  <dig> . the gene order in all species is clockwise



pcr-based cloning and functional analysis of the candidate stripe rust resistance gene
we obtained a candidate resistance gene by sequencing pcr products amplified by seven primers  from genomic dna and then comparing the amplified sequence with that of the contig . this gene was  <dig>  bp in the resistant lines l <dig> and yu <dig> but  <dig>  bp in the susceptible lines l <dig> and my <dig> . the genomic sequence of the candidate resistance gene isolated from l <dig> and yu <dig> included four exons  and three introns . the fourth exon contained a single repeat of the  <dig> bp sequence in the resistant l <dig> line and its parent yu <dig> as well as two repeats in the susceptible l <dig> line and its parent my <dig>  we also identified and verified a single nucleotide polymorphism  in the first exon, with an adenine  in the resistant lines and a cytosine  in susceptible lines l <dig> and my <dig> .

the open reading frame   of the candidate resistance gene encodes a putative wheat copper binding protein  <dig>  predicted to contain  <dig> amino acids in resistant lines  and  <dig> amino acids in susceptible lines. the snp in the first exon  does not change the deduced amino acid sequence. the  <dig> bp repeated sequence in the fourth exon  caused an addition of  <dig> amino acids  in the susceptible line  at amino acids 242– <dig>  the deduced amino acid sequence forms a protein containing two predicted copper-binding domains, at amino acids 34– <dig> , and at amino acids 170– <dig>  . the full-length, deduced wcbp <dig> protein shows sequence similarity with known heavy metal-binding proteins from diverse species. phylogenetic analysis indicated that wcbp <dig> shared the highest similarity with the ems <dig> protein , but they did not cluster together.fig.  <dig> the wcbp <dig> gene, its putative protein structure, and its phylogenetic tree. a the predicted mrna structure of wcbp <dig> is shown above the genomic sequence, including introns  and exons . atg represents the methionine start codon, and tga represents the stop codon. b coding regions of two heavy metal copper-binding domains in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the major differences between the resistance-and susceptibility-associated wcbp <dig> alleles are a snp in exon  <dig> and a  <dig> bp deletion in exon  <dig>  c alignment of the amino acid sequences and secondary structures of the proteins putatively encoded by the resistance-and susceptibility-associated alleles of wcbp <dig>  d phylogenetic tree constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm in mega  <dig>  following wcbp <dig> protein sequence alignment using the clustalw program. accession numbers for the other heavy metal copper-binding proteins were as follows: ems <dig>  , emt <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , eay <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , afk <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , bak <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , daa <dig>  , np_ <dig>  , eoa <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , xp_ <dig>  , afk <dig>  , eay <dig>  , xp_ <dig>   and afw <dig>  



sequence analysis identified a highly similar gene, wcbp <dig>  on chromosome 1a. this gene had the same dna sequence in l <dig> and l <dig>  wcbp <dig> and wcbp <dig> show  <dig>  % dna sequence similarity. moreover, no polymorphism in the length of fragments was detected in genomic dna of resistant and susceptible varieties.

wcbp <dig> and wcbp <dig> are differentially regulated in association with resistance
to examine possible involvement of wcbp <dig> in defense against stripe rust, we measured its transcript levels at different time points following pathogen inoculation . wcbp <dig>  was upregulated in leaves following pst inoculation of both the resistant and the susceptible parent. transcript abundance of wcbp <dig> was significantly higher  in leaves from l <dig> and l <dig> at  <dig> h post inoculation than prior to inoculation . however, at later time points, the wcbp <dig> transcript abundance decreased in l <dig> but remained higher in l <dig>  at  <dig> h post-inoculation, the wcbp <dig> transcript abundance was significantly lower in l <dig> compared to l <dig> .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr expression analysis of wcbp <dig> and wcbp <dig>  amplification of wcbp <dig>  and wcbp <dig>  transcripts following pst infection. c, amplification of wcbp <dig>  and wcbp <dig>  transcripts following mock inoculation with water. the experiment was performed using three biological replicates with three technical replicates per biological sample. relative expression was calculated using gapdh as a reference gene to infer steady-state mrna levels, and relative expression was normalized by setting the control sample from l <dig> at  <dig> h to  <dig>  bars represent the standard error, and the significance was determined using independent sample t-tests. asterisks represent significant differences as follows: **p ≤ <dig> , *p ≤ <dig> ; ns, no significant difference. the raised asterisks or the ns designation represent differences in gene expression between l <dig> and l <dig> at each time point. asterisks or the ns designation in the trend line represent the differences in gene expression between two adjacent time points in the same genotype



we also measured the transcript levels of wcbp <dig>  prior to inoculation, l <dig> and l <dig> showed similar wcbp <dig> transcript levels, but after inoculation, wcbp <dig> was upregulated only in the resistant l <dig> line. at  <dig> h post-inoculation, wcbp <dig> transcript abundance in l <dig> increased significantly compared with its level prior to inoculation , and wcbp <dig> transcript levels were significantly higher  in l <dig> than in l <dig> at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-inoculation . in addition, we found that mock inoculation with water had no significant effects on the transcript level of either wcbp <dig> or wcbp <dig> in l <dig> or l <dig> at any time point .

discussion
a gene encoding a heavy metal copper-transport protein is involved in response to stripe rust infection
in this study, we identified wcbp <dig> and wcbp <dig>  two genes that encode predicted copper-binding proteins. genes encoding heavy metal copper-binding proteins have proven interesting in multiple studies. for example, similar genes exhibited significant changes in expression in all of eight lines near-isogenic for stripe rust resistance  <cit> . in rice, the pi <dig> gene, encoding a putative heavy metal copper-binding domain protein, confers resistance to blast disease  <cit> . furthermore, the rice gene xa <dig>  encoding a heavy metal copper-transport protein, confers resistance to the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae  <cit> . in humans, hah <dig> encodes a metallochaperone protein belonging to a family of proteins containing metal-binding domains and is related to the menkes/wilson disease protein  <cit> . these findings indicate that a great diversity of copper-binding protein genes can confer resistance to various fungal and bacterial diseases in different species.

qpcr analysis  indicated that the transcription of the wcbp <dig> susceptible allele was inhibited. in contrast, wcbp <dig> is constitutively expressed in both l <dig> and l <dig>  and its sequence is identical in these lines . however, its expression was only activated by inoculation with pst in l <dig>  wcbp <dig> co-segregated with resistance in f2: <dig> populations . expression of both wcbp <dig> and wcbp <dig> was not upregulated  by mock inoculation with water , indicating that these genes respond specifically during the resistance response to stripe rust.

a gene encoding a blue copper-binding protein was induced by various oxidative stresses in arabidopsis and transgenic tobacco plants . indeed, there is an oxidative burst during the primary hypersensitive response  <cit> , which implies that the oxidative burst potentially resulting from pst attack may induce the expression of wcbp <dig> 

wcbp <dig> enhances photosynthetic competence without altering the timing of leaf senescence and protects wheat yields against pst infection.

another interesting category of differentially expressed genes is the leaf senescence-associated genes . previous studies implied that leaf senescence might be involved in the defense against pathogenic fungi  <cit> . transcriptome analysis also confirmed that tasag <dig>  is involved in the plant defense against pst infection  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  %  of sequences were identified as belonging to photosynthesis-like and leaf senescence-like pathways . previous studies showed that many pathogenesis-related  genes are induced during leaf senescence in arabidopsis, and the types and numbers of sags present within this family vary from species to species and from genotype to genotype in the same species infected with the same fungal pathogen  <cit> . fourteen of the sag-related ests  have very high sequence similarity to tasag <dig> . this finding further suggests that unique transcripts of sags are specific to certain yr genotypes.

yrl <dig> confers effective resistance at the seedling and adult stages . the physiological effects of stripe rust on wheat yields were estimated by measuring photosynthetic parameters at the adult stage because yield losses caused by pst infection occur mostly from disease at the adult stage  <cit> . previous studies suggested that a leaf senescence-associated pathway might be involved in the response to stripe rust infection . our data  suggest that pn was regulated by the photosynthetic apparatus rather than by stomatal factors in l <dig>  indicating that l <dig> could actively regulate the photosynthetic pathway following infection with pst. this hypothesis was also supported by observed differences in gene expression.

the increase in photosynthetic competence observed in l <dig> could be due either to an increase in the photochemical efficiency of psii or an increase in the efficiency of excitation capture by open psii reaction centers. the latter phenomenon would result from other aspects of photosynthesis, such as photosynthetic electron transport and light utilization, and could therefore be affected by pathogen infection. the onset of leaf senescence generally occurs at  <dig> days after heading  <cit> . at this time point, leaves from the resistant wheat line l <dig> exhibited significantly higher fv/fm, fv‘/fm’ and Φpsii values as well as significantly lower no compared with that of l <dig> leaves, although the changes in fv/fm, fv’/fm’, qp, Φpsii, and npq were very similar , especially at 20– <dig> days after heading. these findings indicated that the higher photosynthetic competence observed in l <dig> resulted from a higher photochemical efficiency of psii, which is an important, actively regulated mechanism involved in adaptation to disease stress. this result showed that the putative candidate stripe rust resistance gene wcbp <dig> did not alter the onset or progression of leaf senescence . the susceptible allele possibly accelerated the progress of leaf senescence within a normal onset period; therefore, the maintenance of a higher photochemical efficiency in psii is a direct and important factor in protection of yield against pst infection.

yrl <dig> may have originated from a dna sequence change in the wheat genome
we originally thought that yrl <dig> originated from th. intermedium because the pedigree of l <dig> includes th. intermedium  <cit> . however, the fine genetic map of yrl <dig> shows similar marker order and total length that is consistent with the chromosome map of 1b . this result indicates that there is likely no alien chromosome segment in yrl <dig>  comparative genomic analysis of yrl <dig>  also demonstrated that an alien chromosome segment is unlikely. moreover, genes orthologous to wcbp <dig> were also identified in b. distachyon, rice, and sorghum . additionally, we did not detect th. intermedium sequences in the genomic region of yrl <dig> using closely linked markers. furthermore, the genetic linkage map showed that yrl <dig> is located in the centromeric region, whereas it is commonly thought that insertion or translocation of an alien chromosome segment into the centromeric region very rarely occurs in wheat  <cit> . all available evidence supports the hypothesis that yrl <dig> was not transferred from th. intermedium, so we conclude that yrl <dig> is a wheat gene.

wcbp <dig> is a candidate for the yrl <dig> stripe rust resistance gene
the sequence of the wcbp <dig> allele associated with resistance contains a  <dig> bp deletion compared to the sequence in the susceptible line . this finding suggests that resistance originated with the  <dig> bp deletion, similar to the event observed for the blast resistance pi <dig> gene in rice  <cit> . these findings implied that dna sequence changes, especially deletions, might be important mechanisms for evolution of disease resistance in plants. previous studies confirmed that the yr <dig> resistance gene encodes a kinase with a putative lipid-binding domain  <cit> , whereas yr <dig> encodes an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter belonging to a pleiotropic drug resistance subfamily  <cit> . these findings indicate that different yr genes have diverse and specific functions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified the gene wcbp <dig>  which may act as a candidate gene for the wheat stripe rust resistance gene yrl <dig> based on the following evidences. first, the dna sequence of wcbp <dig> was polymorphic between l <dig> and l <dig>  as well as between the parents yu <dig> and my <dig>  and results from the polymorphic amplification demonstrated polymorphism between the wcbp <dig> alleles in all parental pairs. second, genetic mapping of yrl <dig> showed that wcbp <dig> co-segregated with yrl <dig>  third, qpcr analysis confirmed that the expression of wcbp <dig> differed significantly between resistant and susceptible alleles at  <dig> h after pst-inoculation. moreover, the expression of wcbp <dig> in resistant/susceptible plants was upregulated only upon pst infection, while it did not change significantly upon mock-inoculation with water. the fact that wcbp <dig> was not annotated previously can be explained by its putative divergence in being specific to certain yr genotypes. it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that wcbp <dig> is a candidate gene for yrl <dig>  but positive confirmation will come with appropriate transformation experiments.

all wheat materials were planted in the field at the yaan agricultural research station of sichuan agricultural university  during the 2010– <dig> wheat-growing season . seeds were sown in a clay soil on october  <dig>   <dig>  each experiment was executed as a randomized complete block design with three replicates. approximately  <dig> seeds from each line were planted in  <dig>  m rows with  <dig> cm spacing. the susceptible wheat line sy95- <dig>  serving as a vector of the pathogen, was planted in every third row of each population to ensure that all plants had an equal chance of infection. sy95- <dig> was artificially inoculated with pst race cyr <dig> at the seedling stage according to a previously described method  <cit> . the average air temperatures from sowing to grain maturity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  °c. the heading date of both l <dig> and l <dig> was approximately march  <dig>   <dig>  the plants received  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> g n m− <dig> ammonium nitrate at the following growth stages, respectively: one-node, meiosis, heading and anthesis. after planting,  <dig> % imidacloprid wettable powder  was applied to control pests. thirty plants from each genotype showing identical growth and developmental characteristics at heading were marked for all subsequent measurements and observations.

measurement of photosynthetic indices and psii activity
photosynthetic parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured in l <dig> and l <dig> using a portable photosynthesis system  with a red-blue light source and a modulated photosynthesis system , respectively. data collection was carried out once every  <dig> days, starting from heading on march  <dig>   <dig>  through april  <dig>   <dig>  at each sampling date, the mean of three independent measurements from each plant represented the plant phenotypic value, and the average values from  <dig> plants were employed for comparisons between genotypes. measurements, parameter recording, and parameter calculations followed previously described methods  <cit> .

in silico mapping of candidate genes
the genomic locations of the wheat ests were determined in silico via blastn searches against the mapped expressed wheat sequences using graingenes  <dig>   <cit>  at a 10− <dig> threshold probability and via a blastx search against the wheat draft genome  <cit> . sequences without a blastx hit or those showing an e-value of less than 10− <dig> were excluded from the in silico mapping to the wheat genome and the brachypodium genome.

pcr-based mapping of polymorphic ests and linkage analysis for resistance
primers were designed using primer <dig>  <cit>  to amplify ests from wheat genomic dna. wheat genomic dna was extracted using a previously described method  <cit> . primer sequences were listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  pcr amplification and product analysis were performed according to previously described methods  <cit> .

polymorphic primers were used to genotype the segregating population of  <dig> f2: <dig> families . linkage analysis of markers and resistance genes was performed with joinmap  <dig>  <cit> . the linkage group was declared at a lod threshold of  <dig> . subsequently, the chromosomal locations of the linked markers were confirmed using chinese spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and the ditelosomic lines of chromosome 1b  <cit> .

pcr-based cloning of putative stripe rust resistance genes
the primers designed with primer <dig>  according to the contig sequence containing the co-segregated markers and the polymorphic amplicon sequence  <cit>  were employed to amplify the entire length of the candidate gene. these primers were listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  each amplicon was purified using the genejet pcr purification kit  and cloned into the pgem t easy vector . jm109-competent cells were transformed and cultured according to the manufacturer’s protocol. plasmids retrieved using the genejet plasmid miniprep kit  were sequenced by shanghai majorbio bio-pharm technology co., ltd. .

qrt-pcr of the candidate gene and the key unigene conferring resistance
we used m-mlv  to synthesize complementary dna  for real-time qrt-pcr . each  <dig> μl reaction mixture contained  <dig> μg of rna. for qrt-pcr assays,  <dig> μl of the diluted cdna  and  <dig> μl of realmastermix   were included in  <dig> μl reaction volumes. qrt-pcr was conducted using the miniopticon time pcr detection system with the following program: pre-incubation at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, followed by amplification for  <dig> cycles at  <dig> °c for  <dig> s and  <dig> °c for  <dig> s. the melting curve was set at  <dig> to  <dig> °c, with a  <dig>  °c increase per step, and cooling was set at  <dig> °c for  <dig> s. each qrt-pcr run was replicated with three independent biological samples, and three technical repeats were included for each biological sample. the primer sequences and descriptions of the genes are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the crossing point value and results of the melting curve analyses were obtained using roche cfx manager software for the miniopticon system  <dig>  . melting curve data showing only a single peak, which denotes primer specificity , were collected for all samples. the repeatability and reliability of amplifications are demonstrated by the raw data shown in additional file 1: figure s1b.
