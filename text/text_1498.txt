BACKGROUND
bovine tuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous disease mainly affecting lymph node and lung tissues of cattle. it is caused by mycobacterium bovis, a member of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group of bacteria. at the genome level, m. bovis shares  <dig> % identity with mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of human tuberculosis  <cit> .

the various ecotypes of m. bovis have a wide host range  <cit>  and can infect a variety of species such as badgers  <cit> , deer  <cit> , smaller mammals  <cit>  and diverse free-living and domesticated species  <cit> . more exotic species may also be at risk through the diversification of farming practices  <cit> . badgers and deer can become reservoirs of disease, making eradication from the countryside difficult, although the risks posed by each species are still the subject of research and debate. humans are rarely affected, but people in some occupations such as veterinarians, farmers and abattoir workers may be more at risk  <cit> . in the uk, human cases tend to be isolated events with no maintenance of the disease in the population  <cit> .

bovine tuberculosis  is not uniformly distributed throughout great britain but concentrated in the south-west of england and wales. broadly, these hot-spot areas of disease match areas of highest cattle density in uk herds. cattle-to-cattle transmission is therefore a likely significant route of infection which may be exacerbated by the movement of infected cattle  <cit> . surveillance testing of cattle for btb is carried out using the tuberculin skin test. positive reactors are slaughtered and examined post mortem when tissues are taken for confirmatory testing by culture. herds in which a breakdown has occurred are subject to repeat testing every  <dig> days until two tests are clear. approximately 6% of cattle herds were under restriction at some point in  <dig> because of a btb incident. in the same year, approximately  <dig>  cattle  were slaughtered; the financial cost of testing and in compensation payments to farmers amounted to £ <dig> million. the trend is for confirmed new incidents to increase by 18% per year posing a growing risk to animal health and welfare and an increasing financial burden for the taxpayer  <cit> .

routine culture and histology of lymph nodes both with and without visible lesions , are undertaken to isolate and type the causative strain of the organism. in  <dig>  the last complete year for which figures are available,  <dig>  samples were sent for culture to the veterinary laboratory agency . of these,  <dig>  were from cases with vl and  <dig>  from nvl cases. a further  <dig> samples with vl were found during surveillance at the slaughterhouse. in these cases, culture supported by histological examination is used to confirm or rule out infection with m. bovis. culture results take at least  <dig> weeks but usually take up to six weeks for paucibacillary specimens. the diagnosis is made on morphological grounds by characteristic appearance of the mycobacterial colonies on various growth media. dna prepared from cultures is used for molecular typing studies including spoligotyping  <cit>  and variable nucleotide tandem repeat  typing  <cit> .

in this setting, the development of a reliable and rapid screening test would be of great help in the control of the disease and in specific situations such as faster confirmation of bovine tb infection in slaughterhouse cases. polymerase chain reaction  methods offer great potential in this respect and several methods, including real-time pcrs have been evaluated for btb applications  <cit> . these have been used in research applications and epidemiological studies, but have yet to make significant impact on diagnostic procedures in the uk. with information gained from the m. bovis sequencing project  <cit> , we have evaluated two pcr methods for possible diagnostic use; a sensitive screening method and a specific confirmatory test for btb. two separate studies were undertaken on cattle lymph nodes with vl and the results compared. study  <dig> comprised of  <dig> lymph node tissue samples with vl received in  <dig> by the vla, weybridge for m. bovis testing. based on the pcr results obtained from study  <dig>  modifications were made to the dna extraction procedure and the effects of these were evaluated in a second study of further  <dig> vl samples received during  <dig> 

RESULTS
tissue culture
m. bovis positive isolates were identified according to their growth characteristics and appearances on the lowenstein-jensen base , lj plus glycerol , lj plus pyruvate  and 7h <dig> slopes. the organisms grow poorly or not at all on ljg. rough, opaque colonies appear on the other media. these float off when the slope is tilted and the inoculum liquid residue at the bottom of the tube washes across the surface.

heat inactivation trial of m. bovis extracted in nuclisens™ buffer
no growth was observed in either the m. bovis standard af61/2122/ <dig> or in the cattle sample  when these were taken into the guanidinium lysis buffer . in contrast, growth on 7h <dig> medium was observed in the control aliquots of af61/2122/ <dig>  lysis buffer completely inactivated m. bovis cells over  <dig> hours at 4c without the need for heat inactivation. the conclusion is that samples from cattle vl tissues treated in this way can be safely processed outside of a cat iii area.

pcr minimum detection limits
the is <dig> method was the most sensitive, detecting as little as  <dig>  fg dna , whereas the rd <dig> method, which amplifies a single copy target, was  <dig> times less sensitive at  <dig>  fg .

validation of is <dig> and rd <dig> pcr methods
the is <dig> method detected all of the mtb complex strains tested including m. canetti, m. tuberculosis , all microti reference and field strains, the m. bovis strain af2122/ <dig>  bcg pasteur and the vla panel of  <dig> major spoligotypes. mott strains were not amplified.

the rd <dig> method detected m. bovis af2122/ <dig>  bcg pasteur and the vla panel of  <dig> different spoligotypes. no products were amplified from other mtb complex members  or any of the mott tested.

pcr of field samples
study  <dig>  one hundred and nine samples were extracted using the procedures described below. cultures were set up and compared with pcr methods for bovine dna  and the m. bovis pcr methods using is <dig> and rd <dig>  in this study, 98/ <dig> samples were found to be culture positive and grew m. bovis. of these,  <dig> were positive for is <dig>  a sensitivity of  <dig> %. three of the  <dig> culture negative samples were is <dig> pcr positive. the rd <dig> pcr detected  <dig> of the  <dig> culture positives . the same  <dig> culture negative samples were also positive by rd <dig> pcr. the reasons for the low pcr sensitivity were investigated. a modified hemi-nested is <dig> pcr method was used to re-amplify dna from all  <dig> samples. the sensitivity rose by only 5% to  <dig> % detected, suggesting that first round pcr was efficient. the cytb housekeeper gene was successfully amplified from all tissues. these observations implied that the level of dna recovery from mycobacteria was probably the cause for the low pick-up rate. a number of experiments were performed to find the cause. spiking of control cattle tissue with different numbers of bcg cells showed that recovery from these measured by real-time pcr was as low as 22% of the theoretical added colony forming units , determined by culture.

three modifications were tried to improve the extraction efficiency. these were  <dig>  bead beating ,  <dig>  sonication and  <dig>  inclusion of an additional step of  <dig> freeze-thaw cycles of crude extracts in liquid nitrogen. for sonication, the elma t 460/h ultrasonic bath operating at  <dig> khz was used . sonication for  <dig> minutes resulted in improved recovery in some samples but resulted in pcr failures of known positives and was therefore abandoned. this may have been due to variability between tissue homogenates. bead beating was effective but more expensive and tubes were prone to leakage, raising issues of cross-contamination for routine diagnostic use. in pilot experiments using samples spiked with known numbers of m. bovis cells determined by culture, freeze-thawing improved recovery of added dna by  <dig> -fold and could be achieved without opening the tubes.

study  <dig> pcr versus culture
a formal test of this procedure was performed by assay of a further  <dig> lymph-node extracts from tissues with vl. of these,  <dig> were subsequently shown to be culture positive for m. bovis,  <dig> were negative. again, all extracts were pcr positive for bovine dna . seventy-eight of the culture positives were is <dig> pcr positive . seven of the  <dig> culture negatives were also is <dig> pcr positive . of  <dig> culture positive cases which were pcr negative for both is <dig> and rd <dig>   <dig> were reported as typical of btb with acid-fast organisms, one was reported as atypical in appearance and  <dig> were not done due to insufficient tissue. the rd <dig> method detected  <dig>  of culture positives and  <dig> of the culture negatives. in both studies all rd <dig> positives were also positive by is <dig> pcr.

study  <dig> histology
sixty-seven of the  <dig> samples  which were m. bovis culture positive were reported as typical of btb with presence of acid-fast mycobacteria. ten of the remainder were described as atypical in appearance. no histology report was filed on the remaining  <dig> cases as there was insufficient tissue available. morphological appearances in  <dig> of the  <dig> culture negative cases were reported as typical of btb with acid-fast bacilli. three were reported as atypical of btb, one was reported as actinobacillus and no report was filed in  <dig> cases.

study  <dig> comparison of pcr with histology
of the culture positive cases reported as typical of btb with acid-fast staining, 65/ <dig>  were is <dig> pcr positive and 40/ <dig>  were rd <dig> positive. ten cases were atypical in appearance and acid-fast negative. of these 10/ <dig>  were is <dig> positive and 9/ <dig>  were rd <dig> positive. histology was not performed in  <dig> cases due to lack of tissue and of these, 6/ <dig>  and 5/ <dig>  respectively were pcr positive by is <dig> and rd <dig> 

quantitation of vl samples using qpcr
in a small pilot study, real-time qpcr was used to measure m. bovis dna in cattle extracts. ten is <dig> pcr positive vl extracts were measured. the results are shown in table  <dig>  a wide variation in mycobacterial count was apparent. the use of is <dig> pcr for quantitation assumes that field strains of m. bovis contain the same copy number of is <dig> elements as reference strain used in preparation of the standards. this is a reasonable assumption for uk isolates and the greater majority of m. bovis strains likely to be encountered  <cit> .

spoligotyping of vl extracts from studies  <dig> and 2
study  <dig>  all but  <dig> of the  <dig> culture-positive samples from the first study were successfully spoligotyped from cultures using the standard protocol. four spoligotypes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> accounted for approximately 80% of the uk strains. the remaining isolates were spoligotypes  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> . two spoligotypes,  <dig> and  <dig>  occurred once each.

of  <dig> vl dna extracts spoligotyped directly from study  <dig>   <dig>  generated recognisable patterns. these were all cases pcr positive by both rd <dig> and is <dig>  a further  <dig> produced recognisable spoligotypes but with missing spacers, probably reflecting a form of allele "drop-out". the remaining  <dig> samples failed to give more than a few spacers and no type could be determined despite the fact that  <dig> of these were also pcr positive for is <dig> and rd <dig>  spoligotyping of  <dig> samples from study  <dig> was performed at vla using the standard protocol . of these just  <dig>  yielded a recognisable pattern, the remainder producing only a partial fingerprint. therefore, although a greater success rate was obtained with the modified pcr procedure, these findings were suggestive of poor dna quality or quantity in both studies.

discussion
we have used a sensitive pcr based assay to screen cattle lymph nodes with vl suggestive of infection with m. bovis and have compared the findings with the gold standard method of diagnosis using routine culture and with histology. the is <dig> pcr was found to be extremely sensitive as judged by detection of partially-purified mycobacterial dna, detecting less than one genome copy. this is almost certainly due to the multi-copy nature of the target  <cit> . the rd <dig> pcr was approximately  <dig> times less sensitive but still able to detect the equivalent of  <dig> organisms when using purified dna.

the first study of vl extracts, in which only  <dig> % of culture positives were also positive by is <dig> pcr, was therefore surprising. we judge that the measures taken to overcome pcr inhibition were effective. we base this on the successful amplification of the cytb housekeeper gene product in all cases, on the formation of primer-dimer in reaction tubes negative for is <dig> as well as on the is <dig> pcr success rate in study  <dig> . hemi-nesting of the first-round is <dig> products did not greatly increase the pick-up rate by more that 5%, to  <dig> %. this suggests that the first-round was already optimised and that dna template may have been limiting. the second pcr was specific for m. bovis and used primers flanking the region of difference which defines this mycobacterium  <cit> . in study  <dig>  the rd <dig> assay detected 50% of m. bovis culture positives. as the method amplifies a single-copy target, some reduced sensitivity is to be expected compared to is <dig> pcr. however, sensitivity of both methods was disappointing given the minimum detection limits determined for amplification of partially-purified genomic mycobacterial dna.

it is well accepted that the initial processing of mycobacterial samples can be problematical compared to eukaryotic cells. we therefore embarked on a series of experiments to determine the cause in this instance. key amongst these was the observation that the recovery of dna from intact cultured m. bovis cells added to crude homogenates could be as low as 22% of the expected yield. bead beating, sonication and freeze thawing in liquid nitrogen were examined for their ability to increase this yield. using qpcr it was found that simple "snap" freezing  <dig> times in liquid nitrogen increased recovery of m. bovis dna from intact cells by a factor of  <dig>  subsequently, the routine nuclisens™ extraction procedure was modified to include this step and the result compared with culture using a further  <dig> samples.

results from the second study indicated a far greater overall sensitivity of the is <dig> screening pcr when the freeze/thaw cycles were performed. the is <dig> sensitivity rate for culture positives rose to 91% . the detection rate with the rd <dig> pcr also increased, to  <dig> % . as found for study  <dig>  both methods also detected positives amongst the culture negative cases . this probably reflects amplification of mycocterial dna from non-viable organisms, rather than contamination. all extracts prepared in study  <dig> were again positive for bovine dna. the 91% sensitivity achieved with is <dig> linked with a modified extraction protocol, shows that this pcr would be a feasible addition to culture when rapid results are required. it is likely that increase in sensitivity reflects greater recovery of mycobacterial dna. we speculate this stems from either improved lysis of the mycobacterial cell walls or greater dissociation of the dna from particulate matter in the crude homogenates, allowing improved recovery in supernatants after centrifugation.

the sensitivity of pcr was found to be greater than histology  and there was no evidence to suggest that most of the pcr negative samples were those with few or absent acid-fast bacilli. indeed, of  <dig> samples reported as atypical of btb, all were positive by is <dig> pcr. in light of these observations there may be a case for reviewing the role of histology in the diagnosis of btb, possibly through comparison of the technique with quantitative pcr and culture of material with visible lesions.

examination of the literature reveals the importance of the extraction step. mycobacteria present some well recognised problems not generally encountered with other bacteria or eukaryotic cells and these are related to the robust mycobacterial envelope  <cit> . pcr methods should be assessed as a combination of both dna recovery and the pcr. the extraction procedure should deliver effective lysis of mycobacteria, good recovery of the dna from a complex mixture of tissue debris and lastly, removal of pcr inhibitors. a number of studies have addressed the problem of initial processing of mycobacterial samples and a number of procedures are described. these range from simple boiling and centrifugation  <cit> , trapping of dna on chelex resin  <cit> , bead-beating  <cit> , sonication  <cit> , enzymic digestion  <cit> , sequence capture  <cit> , commercial kits with lysis reagents  <cit>  and combinations of these various approaches  <cit> . several of these studies have compared procedures, often with differing conclusions. the literature is particularly complex on this subject and reflects the fact that groups have compared different versions of the same general method, tested different samples and assessed recovery using different criteria. for example, the ability to obtain a pcr product or not on known culture positives  <cit> , the absorbance  of recovered dna  <cit>  or real-time pcr to quantitate the dna  <cit> . it seems fair to conclude that there are a number of different methods which can be made to work effectively if sufficient steps are included to satisfy the three main criteria listed above  <cit> . for routine diagnostic use, there are the further considerations of ease of use, potential for automation and cost.

silica-based methods of dna extraction  <cit>  have been widely evaluated and found to be one of the most efficient with columns generally more efficient than slurries  <cit> . however, homogenates from the cattle vl samples tested were lipaemic and noted to block resin-containing columns; therefore slurries of silica were used in the present study. the guanidinium buffer was shown to inactivate mycobacteria after overnight exposure, allowing processing of samples to take place outside a category  <dig> containment laboratory. minor modifications were made to the standard wash steps  to keep the silica free-flowing. whilst the nuclisens™ kit is generally good at removal of pcr inhibitors, these were still encountered in vl extracts, and so these were routinely diluted to overcome their effect and additional taq polymerase added.

qpcr using the is <dig> and rd <dig> methods was achieved by the simple inclusion of the dna intercalating dye sybr green in the master mixes. sybr green provides an economical means of performing qpcr and additionally allows monitoring of conventional pcr. it was used routinely to optimise assay parameters, to follow product development and to ensure reliability of contamination measures. melt analysis of amplicons formed at the end of the run was generally found to be a good indicator of outcome but we would still recommend gel electrophoresis to confirm correct product size as occasionally negative samples which generate a "ladder" of non-specific products are encountered and these can complicate interpretation of the melt profiles. alternatively, taqman™ versions of the assays could be easily devised and these would preclude the need for melt analysis or gel electrophoresis.

in a proof-of-principle study we applied qpcr to  <dig> vl extracts using the is <dig> method. the results  showed mycobacterial copies in extracts ranging from a few hundred genome equivalents up to over  <dig> million. the paucibacillary nature of some of the extracts probably explains in part the low sensitivity of the rd <dig> method as only 5% of any extract was assayed in any pcr assay. dilution to overcome pcr inhibition would have further reduced this to as little as five genome equivalents in some cases  bringing it near the limits of detection. therefore, our results suggest qpcr is best undertaken with is <dig> pcr or other multi-copy targets.

attempts at direct spoligotyping indicated that this technique could not be relied upon to produce a full fingerprint in up to 50% of vl samples. we consider that the failure to generate a full pattern in these cases might be due to either poor quality or quantity of dna in some tissue extracts or possibly, a combination of both. spoligotyping is a form of multiplex pcr in that multiple loci must amplify to obtain a complete fingerprint and multiplex pcrs tend to be less sensitive than those amplifying single loci  <cit> . the quantitative pcr study on vl specimens showed that the numbers of organisms in some extracts was limited to a few hundred and when dilutions are taken into consideration then dna in aliquots would be near or at the limits of detection of the pcr technique.

the use of primers flanking deletion regions in the m. bovis genomes, which encompasses classic m. bovis subspecies such as m. bovis caprae, m. pinnipedii and antelope and other animal isolates, ensures a degree of specificity not generally attainable for detection of pathogen dna particularly if sampling from problem sources such as faeces, soil or other environmental material. we have previously used methods which exploit these one-way deletion events for detection and categorising isolates within this lineage, as have others  <cit> . an assessment of both is <dig> and rd <dig> methods on environmental samples is planned as part of a new defra initiative in late  <dig>  this will follow oie criteria for validation and will be a stringent test of the is <dig> pcr.

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest that the is <dig> pcr is a good candidate assay for routine screening of cattle lymph nodes and other tissues for m. bovis or other mtb complex infection. efficient dna extraction is crucial to the success rate of pcrs applied to such tissues, where mycobacterial numbers can be low. the resilient mycobacterial cell wall, the presence of tissue debris and the paucibacillary nature of some vl tissue may all contribute to this problem. any of these factors may restrict application of other more discriminant typing methods.

further quantification of numbers of bacilli in cattle lymph nodes from vl and nvl cases is required to determine the proportion of samples in which pcr is likely to be beneficial to diagnosis. the is <dig> pcr may also be useful for reducing the total number of samples cultured. moreover, as the sensitivity of pcr was greater than histology  and results can be available within a few days, there may be a case for replacing histology with a molecular method.

confirmatory and genotyping tests, like the rd <dig> pcr  and other multiplex methods are unlikely to achieve a useful sensitivity in paucibacillary specimens unless some way can be found of improving assay sensitivity, such as single tube nested methods. similarly, spoligotyping and more discriminant typing methods like vntr are likely to be restricted to multibacillary tissues or to dna purified from cultures unless some means can be found of improving method sensitivities for routine diagnostic use.
