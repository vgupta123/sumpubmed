BACKGROUND
legumes are able to enter into a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia. the symbiosis culminates in the formation of the root nodule, which provides an optimal environment for the bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen for use by the plant. it was estimated that the legume-rhizobial symbiosis can fix more than half of the amount of nitrogen produced by the chemical fertilizer industry
 <cit> .

the legume-rhizobial interaction begins with a molecular dialogue between the two symbiotic partners
 <cit> . flavonoid compounds released into the rhizosphere by the legume roots attract rhizobia and induce the expression of a set of bacterial genes, known as the nod genes
 <cit> . the enzymes encoded by the nod genes enable the synthesis and secretion of bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharides known as nodulation  factors
 <cit> . perception of nod factors by the cognate host receptors in turn activates a suite of host responses that are essential for accommodation of bacterial invasion
 <cit> . one of the earliest plant responses is the curling of the root hairs which traps rhizobial bacteria within a structure called the colonized curled root hair
 <cit> . it is within these trap sites that infection threads are initiated and extended, through which the bacteria are transported and ultimately released to the dividing cortical cells named the nodule primordium
 <cit> . within these nodule cells, the bacteria are enclosed in host-membrane-bound compartments known as symbiosomes and differentiate into the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids
 <cit> . during the last decade, a number of plant genes have been identified in medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus that are required for rhizobial infection and nodule development
 <cit> . the cloning and characterization of these genes has revealed the nodulation signaling pathway that is conserved in legumes
 <cit> .

a significant property of the legume-rhizobial symbiosis is its high level of specificity
 <cit> . beyond the specificity for the legume family, individual legume species/genotypes can only interact with certain restricted group of bacterial species or strains. specificity in this system can take place at multiple stages of the interaction, ranging from initial bacterial infection and nodulation  to late nodule development associated with nitrogen fixation efficiency 
 <cit> . understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic specificity will enable genetic manipulation of the host or bacteria in order to enhance the agronomic potential of the root nodule symbiosis. this can be achieved either by extending the host range of bacterial strains with high nitrogen fixation efficiency or conversely, by excluding indigenous soil strains that are highly competitive for nodulation but with low nitrogen-fixing capability
 <cit> .

the establishment of a root nodule symbiosis involves the exchange of a series of signals between the plant and bacteria. accordingly, genetic control of symbiosis specificity is complex and multiple mechanisms could be involved
 <cit> . it is widely believed that the host range is mainly determined by specific recognition of bacterial nod factors by the cognate host receptor
 <cit> . however, natural variation in nod factor receptors that causes changed specificity has rarely been documented. in contrast, a number of dominant genes have been identified in soybeans and other legumes that restrict nodulation with specific rhizobial strains
 <cit> . the dominant nature of these genes resembles ‘gene-for-gene’ resistance against plant pathogens
 <cit> . we have demonstrated that a component of this specificity in soybeans is defined by plant nbs-lrr resistance genes that recognize effector proteins delivered by the type iii secretion system  of the rhizobial symbionts
 <cit> . however, the lack of a t3ss in many sequenced sinorhizobium meliloti strains raises the question of how the specificity is regulated in the medicago-sinorhizobium system beyond nod-factor perception. to address this question, we screened a core collection of m. truncatula genotypes with several strains of s. meliloti and identified a naturally occurring dominant gene, mt-ns <dig>  in m. truncatula that restricts nodulation by s. meliloti rm <dig>  genetic mapping experiments indicated that mt-ns <dig> is not likely a typical r gene. thus, cloning and characterization of mt-ns <dig> will add a new dimension to our knowledge about the genetic control of nodulation specificity in the legume-rhizobial symbiosis.

RESULTS
natural variation in symbiosis specificity in m. truncatula
it had previously been reported that the m. truncatula plants showed differential nitrogen fixation efficiency when inoculated with different rhizobial strains
 <cit> . however, to our knowledge, natural variation in nodulation specificity  has not been well-documented. to gain a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying symbiosis specificity in the m. truncatula-sinorhizobium interaction, we screened a core collection of  <dig> m. truncatula genotypes using the s. meliloti strains ngr <dig>  ngr <dig>  and rm <dig>  these plant genotypes capture a wide range of genetic diversity present in natural populations of m. truncatula <cit> . this experiment revealed tremendous variation in nodulation capacity and nitrogen fixation specificity between different genotype-rhizobial combinations . in particular, this screen revealed that rm <dig> was unable to nodulate the plant genotypes f <dig>  and turkey , while the same plant genotypes nodulated normally with other s. meliloti strains. thus, we postulate that there exist host genes that control strain-specific nodulation in m. truncatula. for genetic analysis of the nodulation specificity in this system, we chose to focus on f <dig>  because turkey was not compatible when crossed with several other m. truncatula genotypes.

rm <dig> induced root hair curling and nodule primordium formation but failed to infect the roots of f <dig> 
s. meliloti rm <dig> is a wild-type strain originally isolated from alfalfa nodules in hungary
 <cit> . specifically, this strain contains a strain-specific k antigen  which is able to compensate for the lack of exopolysaccharides  production that is generally required for successful invasion of indeterminate nodules on the alfalfa roots
 <cit> . the rm <dig> genome has recently been sequenced, consisting of a  <dig> -mb chromosome, two symbiotic plasmids , and a 246-kb nonsymbiotic plasmid prme41a
 <cit> . it is noteworthy that, similar to many other sequenced s. meliloti strains, the genome of rm <dig> does not possess genes encoding a type iii secretion system  that delivers effector proteins into the host cell
 <cit> .to examine the infection process, we used an rm <dig> strain that constitutively expresses the green fluorescent protein  from a stably maintained plasmid vector phc <dig>  while inoculation of f <dig>  by rm <dig> failed to induce root nodule formation, the rhizobial strain was able to induce both root hair curling and nodule primordium formation , suggesting that the early responses of nod-factor perception were not affected. the bacteria can normally colonize the curled root hairs and occasionally, we can detect aborted, aberrant infection threads present on the f <dig>  roots . however, in contrast to the compatible interaction between rm <dig> and a <dig> , normal infection threads were never observed on the roots of f <dig> . in consistent with these observations, the nodule primordia on the f <dig>  roots contained no bacteria despite frequent presence of bacterial colonies on the epidermal surface of the nodule primordia . due to a lack of infection, cortical cell division on the f <dig>  roots ceased at an early stage, whereas on a <dig> roots, infected nodule primordia were readily formed within 4– <dig> days post inoculation . based on these observations, we conclude that the restriction of nodulation by rm <dig> in f <dig>  was due to block of bacterial infection rather than a failure in nod factor perception.

exopolysaccharides production of rm <dig> is required for establishing efficient symbiotic interactions with m. truncatula
rhizobial surface polysaccharides, such as exopolysaccharides , capsular polysaccharides , and lipopolysaccharides , form complex macromolecular structures at the bacterium–plant interface and play important roles in establishment of the symbiotic relationship between the host and bacteria
 <cit> . in particular, these polysaccharides have been implicated in playing a key role in facilitating infection thread initiation and extension in the alfalfa-s. meliloti interactions
 <cit> . despite being symbiotically important, these molecules, as common microbe-associated molecular patterns  of the rhizobial bacteria, may also trigger defense responses upon recognition by the cognate host pattern recognition receptors  and thus are possibly associated with symbiosis specificity.

we inoculated the a <dig> , dza <dig>  , and f <dig>   plants with rm <dig> mutants that are defective in production of various components of surface polysaccharides. the mutants used in this study included ak <dig>  an exob mutant of rm <dig> deficient in eps production ; pp <dig>  an rkp <dig> mutant of rm <dig> deficient in production of kps , and pp <dig>  an rkp <dig> mutant of ak <dig> deficient in production of both eps and kps  . our data showed that pp <dig>  behaved similar to the wild-type strain rm <dig> and can normally nodulate a <dig> and dza <dig> , suggesting that kps production of rm <dig> is not required for nodulation with the m. truncatula genotypes a <dig> and dza <dig> . in contrast, ak <dig>  and pp <dig>  were not able to nodulate dza <dig> , and ak <dig> only induced the formation of a few fix- nodules on the a <dig> roots, which suggested that eps production plays an important role in establishing an efficient symbiosis with m. truncatula and their role can’t be complemented by kps. our data are consistent with that reported by simesk et al.
 <cit> .

*only a few non functional nodules were formed.

neither single nor double mutants of rm <dig> could nodulate f <dig> , which appears to suggest that the incompatibility between f <dig>  and rm <dig> is not associated with eps and kps production. however, we can’t exclude the possibility that eps is required for nodulation in the compatible interaction but also essential for eliciting defense responses in the f <dig>  background. this scenario is similar to the t3ss of pathogenic bacteria, for which t3ss is required for causing disease in susceptible hosts and for eliciting the hypersensitive response in resistant hosts, and defects in the t3ss renders a bacterium non-pathogenic
 <cit> .

the restriction of nodulation by rm <dig> in f <dig>  is controlled by a single dominant gene
for genetic analysis of the nodulation specificity, we used an f <dig> population derived from the cross between the two m. truncatula genotypes a <dig> and f <dig> . a <dig> showed nod + fix + phenotype when inoculated with rm <dig>  from a total of  <dig>  inoculated f <dig> plants,  <dig> plants nodulated, which fits the 3: <dig>  ratio , suggesting that the restriction of nodulation by rm <dig> in f <dig>  is controlled by a single dominant gene. we named this gene as mt-ns <dig> . consistent with the cytological studies described above, the dominant nature of this gene indicates that the non-nodulation phenotype of f <dig>  is not due to a failure in nod factor perception but resembles ‘gene-for-gene’ resistance against pathogen infections.

genetic mapping of mt-ns1
genetic mapping of mt-ns <dig> was initially carried out in an f <dig> population derived from the cross between a <dig> and f <dig> , which allowed us to map the mt-ns <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig>  defined by the flanking markers mtb <dig> and 40h12l . however, the extremely low levels of sequence polymorphisms between a <dig> and f <dig>  prevented us from using this population for fine mapping of the locus. to solve this problem, we developed another f <dig> population derived from the cross of dza <dig>   and f <dig> .

we took advantage of the availability of the m. truncatula genome sequence
 <cit>  to develop high-density snp  markers for fine mapping of the mt-ns <dig> locus. snps were genotyped either by converting to caps  markers or by direct sequencing. phenotyping and genotyping a total of  <dig>  f <dig> plants using the snp markers allowed us to delimit the mt-ns <dig> locus between snp <dig> and snp <dig> , which span ~ <dig> kb based on the genome sequence of jemalong a <dig> . the 50-kb genomic sequence of jemalong a <dig> contains at least six predicted genes based on the medicago truncatula genome release version  <dig>   . these genes include medtr8g <dig>  a ferric-chelate reductase-like protein; medtr8g <dig>  an rnase t <dig> family protein; medtr8g <dig> and medtr8g <dig>  two highly conserved proteins with unknown function; medtr8g <dig>  an a/g-specific adenine dna glycosylase-like protein; and medtr8g <dig>  a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase . in particular, the lrr-rlk  is structurally similar to the dmi2/symrk orthologs in legumes that are required for both rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbioses, which consists of an n-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular malectin-like domain comprising three leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular protein kinase domain
 <cit> . in addition, there exists a tandem duplication–truncation of the rlk- <dig> gene  . as described below, the presence of a large insertion/deletion polymorphism around the mt-ns <dig> locus between f <dig>  and jemalong a <dig> complicated the prediction of candidate genes.

identification of an insertion/deletion polymorphism around the mt-ns <dig> locus
based on our knowledge of the signaling pathways in pathogenic and symbiotic plant-microbe interactions, we had assumed that rlk- <dig> was a strong candidate gene for mt-ns <dig>  this gene may serve as a receptor that directly or indirectly perceives a yet unknown bacterial signal, which in turn triggers host defense responses and blocks bacterial infection. support of this hypothesis also came from the fact that this gene showed root-specific expression . however, we did not detect any expression- and sequence-level polymorphisms between the f <dig>  and a <dig> alleles of rlk- <dig>  since the phenotype of the reference genotype a <dig> is nod + fix- , it is possible that ns <dig> represents a null allele in a <dig>  full cdna amplification identified two copies of lrr-rlk genes in f <dig> ; one corresponds to rlk- <dig> and another matches to the truncated copy trrlk- <dig> in a <dig>  this indicated that trrlk- <dig> is truncated in a <dig> but not in f <dig>  . we also found that the rlk- <dig> is missing in the a <dig> genome. further genome sequencing between the two tandem copies revealed an insertion/deletion polymorphism between the three genomes . the exact size of the insertion in f <dig>  is currently unknown. we are in the process of testing the candidate genes including rlk- <dig>  but our initial experiments showed that transgenic alfalfa and m. truncatula roots containing rlk- <dig> failed to restrict nodulation by rm <dig>  thus, it is likely that ns <dig> resides in the insertion of f <dig>  and the identity is unknown. the insertion size could be very large because our long-range pcr experiments were unsuccessful to fill the gap. further de-novo resembling of sequences from other genotypes is required to resolve this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
establishing a successful interaction between legumes and rhizobia requires signal recognition between the two symbiotic partners. thus, the evolution of symbiosis specificity involves both rhizobial and host genes. from the bacterial side, specificity determinants include nod factors, surface polysaccharides, and secreted proteins. however, we know relatively less from the host side. perception of the nod-factor signal is mediated by direct binding to the host nod factor receptors , which are plasma membrane-localized receptor kinases containing lysm motifs in their extracellular domains
 <cit> . the role of nfrs in regulating host specificity was demonstrated by transferring the l. japonicus versions of nfrs to m. truncatula, which enabled the transgenic m. truncatula roots to nodulate with the l. japonicus symbiont mesorhizobium loti <cit> . however, natural variation in nfrs that causes changed specificity has rarely been documented. in contrast, numerous dominant genes have been identified in soybeans and other legumes that restrict nodulation with specific rhizobial strains
 <cit> . we recently cloned the two soybean genes rj <dig> and rfg <dig> that restrict nodulation with specific strains of bradyrhizobium japonicum and sinorhizobium fredii, respectively
 <cit> . we demonstrated that rj <dig> and rfg <dig> are allelic genes encoding a member of the toll-interleukin receptor/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat  class of plant resistance  proteins. our discovery is consistent with recent reports that documented a large number of secreted effectors delivered into the host cell by rhizobial t3ss and suggests that establishment of a root nodule symbiosis requires the evasion of plant immune responses triggered by rhizobial effectors.

in this study, we have identified a naturally occurring dominant gene, mt-ns <dig>  in m. truncatula that prevents nodulation with s. meliloti rm <dig> and made significant progress toward cloning the gene. the lack of t3ss-encoding genes in the rm <dig> genome suggests that mt-ns <dig> unlikely encode an r gene. consistent with prediction, we did not identify typical r gene homologs around the mt-ns <dig> locus. we hypothesize that mt-ns <dig> likely encodes a pattern recognition receptor that mediates specific recognition of yet unknown mamps of the rhizobial bacteria, resulting in host defense responses. thus, cloning and characterization of mt-ns <dig> will provide novel insights into the genetic control of nodulation specificity in the legume-rhizobial symbiosis.
