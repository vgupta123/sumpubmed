BACKGROUND
deer mice  are the principal hosts of sin nombre virus , which causes the great majority of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome  cases in north america  <cit> . despite a neutralizing antibody response, deer mice become persistently-infected with snv without discernible pathology and can shed virus in excrement  <cit> . the mechanism by which snv evades a sterilizing immune response in deer mice is unknown.

snv principally infects capillary endothelial cells in humans and deer mice without conspicuous cytopathic effects  <cit> . immunochemical evaluation of lung tissues from humans and deer mice reveals the presence of viral antigens; however, no pulmonary inflammation is observed in deer mouse lungs. in addition, hcps patients, but not deer mice, have mononuclear infiltrates in their lungs. these cells produce several proinflammatory cytokines, including il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifnγ, tnf and lymphotoxin-α   <cit> . isolation of snv-specific human t cells suggests th1- and tc1-mediated immune responses in such patients. because of the absence of cytopathology, it is thought that the etiologic mechanism of hcps is principally a cytokine-mediated immunopathology.

deer mice are divergent from the common laboratory house mouse  and rat  by  <dig> million years  <cit> . this substantial divergence has led to variations that render most immunological reagents for these species inadequate for evaluating deer mouse immune responses  <cit> . because of this, methods for profiling t cell gene expression and for evaluating cytokine responses in deer mice must be developed in order to assess such responses during the course of infection with snv.

conventional antibody-based methods for quantitative cytokine detection rely upon the generation of pairs of monoclonal antibodies to distinct epitopes for use in capture elisas. these assays usually require the cloning of full-length cdnas for each cytokine, expression and production of recombinant cytokines, and production of monoclonal antibodies. this process requires substantial effort, expertise and expense.

the development of real-time pcr methods to detect gene expression has resulted in the rapid development of many gene expression assays. one such method for detecting cytokines from unusual species employs the dna-intercalating dye sybr green i  <cit> , which fluoresces when bound to double-stranded dna. in addition, these assays are readily multiplexed from small quantities of cdna.

unlike the production of monoclonal antibodies, the development of real-time pcr assays to detect gene expression requires only partial cdna sequence data, and we recently cloned many such deer mouse sequences  <cit> . using these sequences, we have developed real-time pcr assays that may useful for evaluating t cell subset responses in deer mice, including th <dig>  th <dig> and regulatory t  cells  <cit> . in addition, we have developed conventional pcr detection assays for the expression of the subset-specific transcription factors, t-bet, gata- <dig>  fox-p <dig>  stat <dig>  and stat <dig>  together, these assays may allow the discrimination of helper t cell subsets in deer mice.

RESULTS
generation of klh-specific t cell lines
we previously described methods for long-term culture of outbred deer mouse t cell lines using autologous bone marrow-derived antigen presenting cells  <cit> . our current efforts describe a quantitative means of determining transcription factor and cytokine gene expression in such t cell lines using pcr. polyclonal lymph node-derived cd4+ t cell lines from two deer mice, dm <dig> and dm <dig>  were established and evaluated for their proliferative capacity upon recall challenge with antigen. the lines' proliferative characteristics were similar to our previous results, with half-maximal proliferation at about  <dig> μg/ml of klh  <cit> .

detection of transcription factor gene expression
we developed multiplex a real-time pcr detection assay for th <dig>  th <dig> and treg transcription factors and cytokines based upon the use of sybr green i dna-binding fluorochrome. this assay determines the relative change in gene expression by comparing identical t cell/apc cultures with or without antigen exposure after  <dig> hours. this approach allowed us to determine the relative template abundance  induced in t cells that are activated by antigen.

based upon the half-maximal proliferative capacity, bulk cultures of t cells and autologous apc were established with or without  <dig> μg/ml of klh and incubated for  <dig> hours to allow antigen processing and presentation to t cells. total rna was extracted for assessment of transcription factor gene expression by real-time pcr of cdna . concanavalin a-activated deer mouse splenocytes served as a control. we detected the expression of each gene using real-time pcr. we obtained adjusted cycle threshold  means of triplicate samples by subtracting the instrument-determined ct values from our total cycle number of  <dig> for klh-stimulated and unstimulated t cell lines . the ratio of expression of klh-stimulated and unstimulated cultures was then calculated to determine the rta for each t cell line .

both t cell lines constitutively expressed th2-specific gata <dig> at low to moderate levels; however, substantial increase in antigen-induced expression occurred only with the dm <dig> line. stat <dig> was abundantly expressed by both lines with increased expression in the presence of antigen. th1-specific t-bet was expressed at low levels in dm <dig>  but at high levels in dm <dig>  its expression was dramatically increased in dm <dig> t cells cultured with klh. dm <dig> did not express the th <dig> transcription factor stat <dig>  while dm <dig> expressed it in both antigen-stimulated and unstimulated cells. both lines expressed the th <dig> transcription factor stat <dig>  treg-specific fox-p <dig> was not detected in either line, although it was expressed at very low levels by activated splenocytes.

detection of cytokine gene expression
antigen activation of the dm <dig> t cell line resulted in abundant expression levels of ifnγ and il- <dig>  as well as moderate levels of tnf and tgfβ <dig>  but there was little change in expression of lt or il- <dig> . il- <dig> expression was not detected in these cells. the dm <dig> line expressed abundant ifnγ, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  moderate levels of tnf, but little tgfβ <dig>  lt or il- <dig> 

discussion
deer mice and related peromyscine species are important reservoirs for snv and other human pathogens  <cit> . although syrian golden hamsters can be experimentally-infected with snv  <cit> , only humans, deer mice and, occasionally, other rodents are known to be naturally susceptible to snv, with dramatically different outcomes. spillover to related rodent species does occur, such as in pinyon mice   <cit>  but such transmission does not appear to be an important mode of snv maintenance. the species-specificity and apathogenic infection of hantaviruses for their rodent hosts are well-documented  <cit> , but poorly understood. it is evident that such relationships have evolved over millions of years of coadaptation, as the rodents and their hantaviruses have undergone radial divergence.

many viruses evade sterilizing immune responses with virally-encoded proteins that modulate the host response in a manner favorable to the virus. these viruses typically have many genes; however, hantaviruses are relatively simple, encoding four polypeptides, none of which have been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities. given that deer mice produce high-affinity neutralizing igg to snv  <cit>  an adaptive t cell response must occur during infection, since these events  are mediated by helper t cells and their cytokines. few reagents for laboratory mouse immune markers and cytokines are cross-reactive with deer mouse proteins , thus it has become necessary to develop novel tools for examining t cell responses in deer mice. we previously generated sequence data for many deer mouse immune-function genes  <cit>  and present here their utility for assessing responses of antigen-specific helper t cells.

several functional helper t cell subsets in the laboratory mouse have been characterized based on the expression of clone-specific transcription factors and cytokines  <cit> . th <dig> cells that promote inflammation express the transcription factors stat <dig> and t-bet, and the cytokines ifnγ, tnf and lt. th <dig> cells, which augment antibody synthesis, express stat <dig> and gata <dig>  and il- <dig> and il- <dig>  treg cells are apparently a heterogeneous group of potent anti-inflammatory cells that exhibit differential expression of the transcription factor fox-p <dig> and the cytokines tgfβ <dig> and il- <dig>  a fourth subset, th <dig> cells, has recently been described that expresses the proinflammatory cytokine il- <dig> during some autoimmune diseases  <cit> , but has not been associated with infectious diseases. we sought to develop assays that would allow us to discriminate these subpopulations in the deer mouse. although we have cloned a partial cdna of deer mouse il- <dig>  it has insufficient sequence information for design of suitable real-time pcr primers. thus, we focused on the discrimination of th <dig>  th <dig> and treg cells and our results demonstrate that we are able to detect the expression of these cytokine and transcription factor genes by real-time pcr.

we detected the expression of these genes from deer mouse cells, but we were unable to discriminate discrete subpopulations that correlate with those of the house mouse. because the t cell lines are polyclonal, there may be distinct th <dig>  th <dig> and treg clones in the cultures that express the hallmark cytokines. alternatively, the distinct characteristics used for identifying these t cells in highly inbred laboratory mice may not apply to outbred deer mice. additional work will be required to clone deer mouse t cells in order for such characterizations to be made.

an important caveat of all gene expression assays is that some genes are translationally regulated, thus data from such assays must be evaluated with caution. it would be ideal if the presence or absence of cytokines could be determined using protein-detection assays, such as capture elisas. no such assays are available for the deer mouse model, so gene expression assays currently are the only option. nonetheless, differential expression of cytokine transcripts in antigen-stimulated versus unstimulated cells is suggestive of cytokine production and secretion.

considering the relative ease of cloning genes and developing real-time pcr assays, additional genes can be cloned and used to further characterize deer mouse immune responses, thus clarifying how rodent reservoirs and hantaviruses have evolved an immunological détente. this may also provide clues as to how other viruses persist in their reservoirs.

the availability of these assays will permit the characterization of immune responses in deer mice acutely or persistently infected with snv or with other zoonotic agents. considering that hcps is, at least in part, caused by a cytokine-mediated immunopathologic process, understanding how deer mice remain infected with snv without attendant pathology may suggest potential targets of therapeutic intervention for hcps patients.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed detection assays to assess helper t cell functions in the deer mouse. these assays will provide tools to allow extensive characterization of nonpathogenic immune responses occurring in snv-infected deer mice and provide a rationale for studies of other host-pathogen interactions. such characterizations may clarify the role of the pathological immune response in patients with hantavirus infections and aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets of intervention.
