BACKGROUND
olfaction, the sense of smell, is mediated by a very large family of olfactory receptors , whose chemical interaction with a multitude of odorant ligands initiates a cascade of signal transduction events leading to smell perception  <cit> . or proteins participate also in guiding olfactory sensory neurons axons to their glomerular targets  <cit> , and have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of their own expression  <cit> .

the publication of the complete human genome sequence, as well as that of other mammals such as mouse, dog and chimpanzee, allowed the identification of entire or repertoires in those species via computational data-mining. currently,  <dig> human or genes are known in the human genome  <cit> ,  <dig> in the mouse genome  <cit> ,  <dig> in the rat genome  <cit> ,  <dig> in the dog genome  <cit>  and  <dig> ors in chimpanzee  <cit> . these are represented in the human olfactory receptor exploratorium database  and in the olfactory receptor database   <cit> . in addition to this massive information that has been obtained by scrutinizing genome sequence repositories, several publications have provided information on transcription of or genes in different tissues and species. in mouse, olfactory epithelial ests have been sequenced for more than  <dig> or genes  <cit>  and a custom mouse or microarray was used to examine the expression levels of more than  <dig> genes in olfactory epithelium  <cit> . in contrast, human or expression has been investigated for only a small number of genes, as exemplified by the demonstration of transcripts for genes in an or cluster on human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

ors are expected to be specifically expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where their expression is also highly regulated by mechanisms which allow each sensory neuron to express a single allele of a single or gene  <cit> . or genes are also expressed in the olfactory bulb, where they are specifically localized to the nerve and glomerular layers, potentially related to the targeting of the sensory axons  <cit> . in the present paper we address the question to which degree or genes are expressed in non-olfactory tissues. we use the term "ectopic" defined as "a biological event or process that occurs in an abnormal location or position within the body"  <cit> . we note that the term has also been used to describe abnormal expression in malignant tumors, not studied here.

most of the early reports about ectopic or expression have been related to testis and germ cells, where several dozens of human and mouse ors have been shown to be transcribed  <cit> . these results have led to the hypothesis that at least some ors are involved in mammalian sperm chemotaxis. evidence for the involvement of human hor17- <dig>   <cit>  and mouse mor267- <dig>   <cit>  in sperm chemotaxis has been provided. another hypothesis proposed that ors linked to the major histocompatibility complex locus and expressed in testis are implicated in olfaction-driven mate choice  <cit> .

some human ors were also shown to be expressed in tongue  <cit> , erythroid cells  <cit>  and prostate  <cit> . some murine ors have been shown to be expressed ectopically in placenta, brain, peripheral nervous system, colon and fetal liver  <cit> . because of their broad pattern of tissue expression during development and in adult life, ors have been proposed to play a role in cell-cell recognition  <cit> . despite such reports regarding the potential functions of ectopically expressed ors, this phenomenon is far from being fully understood and requires further systematic investigation.

here we report the first systematic global analysis of spatial or expression patterns in human and mouse. we aim to obtain transcriptional evidence for numerous ors in a large number of tissues, so as to shed further light on the possible factors influencing or ectopic expression. to this end, we have collected mouse and human transcriptome information from various sources, including public domain and celera ests, as well as genome-wide microarray data  <cit> . we found substantial expression in several dozens human and mouse tissues, but no indications for unusually high expression in testis. our results support a neutral or near neutral evolution model for or transcription control, whereby functionality is rendered less likely. all the results are fully available through horde  <cit> .

RESULTS
collection of or transcription data
our first aim was to obtain evidence of transcription for human and mouse or genes. we examined expression data from a multitude of sources, including cdnas and mrnas information as well as microarray data  <cit> . the source of microarray data is the geneatlas <dig> project, which provides whole genome expression patterns in dozens of human and mouse tissues  <cit> .

a search through the geneatlas <dig> data identified  a total of  <dig> probesets matching  <dig> human ors, and  <dig> probesets matching  <dig> mouse ors. probesets were then tested for being positively expressed applying the cross-gene error model on the full microarray data. we identified  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse or genes as expressed in at least one tissue. this analysis included  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse tissues, among them mouse olfactory epithelium, mouse vomeronasal organ, and human and mouse olfactory bulb and testis. every one of these tissues showed positive expression of at least one or gene. further information regarding expression of  <dig> human ors and  <dig> mouse ors was obtained from ests and mrnas. this information was supported by  <dig> human transcripts in  <dig> tissues and  <dig> mouse transcripts in  <dig> tissues.

altogether, we present evidence for the expression of  <dig> human ors and  <dig> mouse ors , which represent approximately 45% of both the human and mouse repertoires. gene expression does not appear to be biased relative to particular genomic or clusters , suggesting that an appreciable proportion of the entire genomic repertoire is likely to be transcribed.

ectopic expression of or genes in non-olfactory tissues
we examined the geneatlas <dig> data using a quantile-based scale  <cit>  for all the expression values in the microarray. ectopic or gene expression was noticeable in a large diversity of non-olfactory tissues. we noted that in every tissue a group of ors showed high expression level even when compared to all the genes included on the microarrays. the highest or expression was observed in non-olfactory tissues, and these differed between human and mouse. in human, atrioventricular node, skin and uterus showed the highest quantile-based expression levels, while in the mouse such tissues were thyroid and salivary gland . while some ors showed a relatively high specificity to particular tissues, others exhibited expression in a number of tissues  and a few ors had high quantile values in all or most tissues, i.e. behaved as housekeeping genes . we examined the matrices of expression again after filtering out  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse or-related probesets, whose specificity or sensitivity was less than  <dig>  the general picture remained as before .

we asked whether the distribution of or expression intensities was different in functionally implicated tissues as compared to other tissues. generally, the distributions were rather similar for the two classes . the functionally implicated tissues  did not display an unusual distribution, nor did they show an unusually high number of highly expressed genes. the number of highly expressed ors in testis was smaller than in olfactory epithelium and bulb . interestingly, these highly expressed ors are not biased toward a genomic location or family affiliation  <cit> . in addition, highly expressed human and mouse ors in the different tissues were not orthologous. more functionally related expression patterns were observed for a set of non-receptor genes with an established olfactory function . note that olfactory marker protein  was expressed in mouse but not in human olfactory bulb. this might be the result of a poor probeset design since human omp is not expressed in any tissue.

across-tissue patterns of expression for individual or genes were eclectic, differing widely from one gene to another . a hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse differentially expressed ors, as determined using an anova test applied to the geneatlas <dig> microarray data . the human or gene tree ramified into two principal branches, whose major expression divergence was observed in the highly expressing tissues. in mouse, no significant clustering was observed. principal component analysis also could not separate the ors expression profiles into distinct groups .

quantification of ectopic expression
to quantify ectopic expression, we ranked for each or gene the ectopic tissues according to their expression level , then for each ranked position we calculated the mean expression intensity and the entropy, which reflects the diversity of tissues in the given position . the entropy was normalized to range from  <dig> to  <dig>  where  <dig> indicates a single tissue population and  <dig> a population of all tissues. for or genes, the entropy in most ranked positions was between  <dig>  and  <dig> , indicating that each position is populated with a great variety of tissues and that none of the tissues dominated the high expression positions, as would have been expected if ors had a specific function in such tissues. reanalyzing the data including olfactory tissues did not change the entropy values, an indication for the low level of ors expression in the olfactory epithelium.

the product of the entropy and the expression intensity at each position was calculated and the mean of all products defined as the ectopic expression index, theoretically ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the ectopic expression index was found to be  <dig>  for human ors and  <dig>  for mouse ors. interestingly, a similar level of ectopic expression was observed in groups of brain specific genes  and spermatogenesis-related genes . in these gene groups, the entropy in most ectopic ranked tissue positions was above  <dig>  and the ectopic expression index ranged from  <dig>  and  <dig>  for human and mouse brain specific genes respectively, to respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  for spermatogenesis-related genes in human and mouse.

comparison with other microarray expression experiments
recently, the results of a custom-made microarray, which includes all mouse or genes hybridized to olfactory epithelium and  <dig> additional tissues  were published in zhang et al.  <cit> . an examination of the  <dig> or genes represented in both our analyzed experiment and that of zhang et al., using the same cutoff criteria, revealed a significant concordance. thus, all  <dig> ors that showed olfactory epithelial expression in our analysis were also highly expressed in the results of zhang et al. .

we further compared the results of the two experiments by examining the correlation between expression profiles of genes that were represented in the two microarrays . the distribution of the correlation values was skewed towards positive values with a median of  <dig>  and a most probable value of  <dig> , results that show a highly significant deviation from randomness . interestingly, the distribution obtained from the correlation values of probesets extracted from the coding region versus the 3' untranslated region  of the same or in zhang et al. had a similar median , although the most probable correlation value was found to be higher:  <dig> . we examined also correlations between expression profiles of two probesets representing the same or gene in the geneatlas <dig> project. only seven such probeset pairs were found and the mean correlation value between their expression profiles was  <dig>  with a standard deviation of  <dig> . reexamination of zhang et al. data revealed abundant ectopic expression not explicitly reported because of the stringent cutoff they used for defining differentially expressed genes.

or expression in sperm and testis
because of the presumed or function in sperm chemotaxis, we examined human and mouse or genes reported to be expressed in sperm and testis  <cit>  and for which we had expression data. most of these ors were probably expressed in testis at levels below the noise-related detection threshold in these experiments . in all cases where higher than background expression was detected, its level in testis was lower than in some other tissue. two ors, the human gene or1d <dig> and the non-orthologous mouse gene mor267- <dig>  have been the focus of more intense previous scrutiny in terms of a potential role in sperm chemotaxis towards the egg. here, none of these genes showed their highest level of expression in testis nor did they show sperm/testis tissue specificity.

expression of or genes and pseudogenes
we asked whether all ors had an equal probability of being transcribed. for this purpose, we analyzed the ests data set, assumed to constitute a random representation of the transcribed or repertoire. the distribution of ests per or in human intact and pseudogenized genes  was found to be in agreement with a poisson distribution within statistical error , as expected in case of equal transcription probability. a similar result was obtained for mouse ors . these results are somewhat tenuous because they could be affected by varying depth of est sampling in different tissues. reanalyzing the distributions based only on spliced ests did not change the agreement to poisson distributions for intact and pseudogenized genes . importantly, there was no significant bias against pseudogene transcription both in human and in mouse non-olfactory tissues .

one or subfamily, 7e, shows an unusually high average level of transcription, significantly different from the one of other intact and pseudogene ors according to the tukey-kramer test , . members of this subfamily were the only or group for which the est coverage differed significantly from a poisson distribution . in this skewed distribution, most 7e genes were under-expressed, while four genes, all belonging to one of the two 7e phylogenetic clades  <cit>  were highly overexpressed. most additional genes represented by ests belonged to the same over-expressed phylogenetic clade.

lack of correlation in orthologous or expression profiles
out of  <dig> orthologous pairs of or genes as previously defined  <cit> ,  <dig> or pairs were found to be represented in both the human and mouse geneatlas <dig> microarrays  <cit> . this allowed us to examine the relationship between their expression profiles in the  <dig> normal tissues shared by the reported human and mouse data . pearson correlations between the expression profiles of each pair were normally distributed around a mean of zero, suggesting that no significant correlation existed between the orthologous expression profiles. a nearly identical distribution was seen for random pairs. in addition, the pearson correlations were independent of the protein sequence divergence between orthologs . no significant correlation was observed when human and mouse orthologs were analyzed for each tissue separately , including the functionally implicated olfactory bulb and testis where ortholog correlation is more likely to be observed  <cit> . in a control test, we compared a set of all  <dig> human-mouse orthologous genes present on the arrays, as well as  <dig> human-mouse orthologous pairs of genes participating in spermatogenesis. the distribution for the former had a mean of  <dig> , in agreement with previous reports comparing orthologs using the same platform and analysis methods  <cit>  and significantly different from the random pairs distribution . for the spermatogenesis related genes the mean was  <dig>   with a positive pearson correlation in testis . it is important to note that all the experiments compared here were performed in the same laboratory using the same platform and analysis methods, thus variations in experimental parameters between species could not account for the observed lack of correlation between or orthologs.

relationship between or expression and genomic neighborhood
we examined the possibility that or gene expression is related to genomic location, and potentially influenced by the transcription of non-or neighboring genes, namely genes not belonging to the or superfamily and located at a maximum distance of  <dig>  m from an or. we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> human ors  represented by at least one est whose source was non-olfactory tissues, have a non-or neighbor. this is in contrast to  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  for ors not observed to be ectopically expressed . in mouse, a similar but weaker trend was found: 51%  of the ectopically expressed ors had a non-or genomic neighbor while the fraction was 42%  for ors not observed to be ectopically expressed .

discussion
wide range of ectopic or transcription
motivated by the need to provide evidence of or transcription, we searched through numerous databases for transcription evidence and successfully provided such information for  <dig> human or genes. since the nominal expression site of or genes, namely olfactory epithelium, is practically not represented in transcript databases, most of the expression evidence presented here originates from ectopic tissues. our results generally indicate that hundreds of or genes have active promoters capable of directing transcription in diverse cellular contexts. as the samples explored are basically unbiased, it is suggested that our results are representative of the entire olfactory receptor gene repertoire.

it could be argued that the ectopic or expression is an artifact of microarray experiments. indeed, microarray experiments are known to be "noisy"  <cit> , requiring independent experimental validation. such validation is presently underway for selected or genes that show unique patterns of expression, and preliminary results show adequate concordance for two genes in terms of tissue-average expression levels, though not yet for individual tissue levels. however, the essence of the presently reported results, namely the widespread occurrence of or expression in ectopic tissues is amply supported by previous reports showing ectopic or transcription by pcr and sequencing methods  <cit> . the identification of numerous or-related ests in diverse tissue origins provides further corroboration. moreover, since we carefully selected the or probesets to avoid possible cross-reaction between similar ors, the observed expression levels could not be a result of summation over numerous genes, each expressed in negligible amounts. in fact, some of the or genes were found to be highly expressed well above the background level.

ectopic expression is a universal phenomenon that extends beyond the or gene superfamily. here, we corroborate this phenomenon for two additional gene groups, brain specific and spermatogenesis-related genes. ectopic expression has been also observed previously at the protein level in enzymes and neurotransmitters and it has been suggested to be widespread in the cells of multicellular organisms  <cit> .

comparison between the olfactory epithelium and other tissues
our findings do not indicate unusually high or expression levels in olfactory epithelium relative to other tissues. this expression is specific for mature olfactory sensory neurons and not for other cell types in the olfactory epithelium, as previously reported  <cit> . at face value, such result could be interpreted as contradicting a function for or genes in olfactory epithelium. however, as each or gene is expressed only in approximately  <dig> % of the sensory neurons, or transcripts are diluted in the total olfactory tissue mrna.

we compared the results of our analyses to the ones of an expression custom-made microarray published by zhang et al.  <cit> . we identified in the geneatlas <dig> microarray  <dig> mouse unique or-related probesets representing  <dig> genes, we could not detect expression in any tissue for  <dig> probesets , from the remaining  <dig> or genes,  <dig> were not found to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium and only  <dig> were expressed in the five upper quantiles. in contrast to our results, they found a higher fraction of or genes that surpass the threshold and are called "enriched in the olfactory epithelium" as compared to fraction of expressed in the olfactory epithelium as emerging from the data analyzed here. su et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> μg of crna in the microarray hybridization experiments, while zhang et al. used  <dig> μg. this difference is a possible explanation as to why we fail to identify olfactory epithelium-specific or transcription.

the median correlation coefficient between the two experiments is in line with those in other reports, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in comparisons among datasets acquired for identical rna samples but in different laboratories and using different experimental and analysis protocols  <cit> . other factors which may account for the differences in the two experiments include the use of mrna from different mouse strains, differences in probeset designs and differences in data processing software. the influence of the probeset design is critical, as learned from comparisons of different results in the same report .

or genes in testis
it is widely believed that the main function of or proteins is in mediating olfaction within the chemosensory organ. in parallel, reports published ever since the discovery of or genes have proposed an additional or function, namely as mediators of sperm chemotaxis. in the past decade, considerable evidence has accumulated in support for this hypothesis  <cit> , but the concept has also been disputed  <cit> . the present study, which addresses the expression of a large number of or genes in olfactory tissues as well as in other tissues, including testis, could help to shed light on this issue. one of the important questions is which of the hundreds of or genes is actually involved in sperm chemotaxis, as such specific function is unlikely to be mediated by the entire or repertoire. previous functional studies have focused on two or genes: the human or1d <dig>   <cit>  and a non-orthologous mouse gene, mor267- <dig>   <cit> . for mor267- <dig> it was stated that it is expressed at low level in testis  <cit> , this is also supported by our results. we found that also or1d <dig> is expressed at low level in testis. our results further show that these two specific ors have a higher expression in other tissues. conversely, other ors are highly expressed in testis but have not been invoked so far as chemotaxis mediators. it should be noted, however, that genes could function in an ectopic tissue  even if they are expressed at higher level in another tissue. the notion that a gene must be expressed at the highest level in the tissue in which it is functional is plausible but exceptions may exist.

or ectopic expression may be selectively neutral
in addition to a proposed role in sperm chemotaxis, ors have been proposed specific roles in numerous other tissues, mostly based on the mere presence of or transcript. this includes cell-cell recognition and organ construction during development  <cit> , taste perception  <cit> , chemical detection of exogenous or endogenous ligands in the cerebral cortex  <cit>  and additional functions  <cit> . does or expression in a given ectopic tissue indicate specific functionality? an alternative scenario would be that ectopic or transcription is predominantly the result of neutral or nearly neutral mechanisms, e.g. small dna sequence changes in regulatory regions, fixed in the population by random drift and not necessarily related to function or fitness  <cit> .

a claim that ectopic or expression may be in part governed by neutral changes is supported by several findings. first, the divergence in the expression patterns of human-mouse orthologous or pairs in ectopic tissues is similar to that of randomly selected pairs. this observation generalizes a previously reported specific case for or51e <dig>  which was found to be over-expressed in human prostate  <cit> , although minor expression could be detected also in brain. its mouse ortholog was found predominantly in brain, and its rat ortholog in brain and liver  <cit> . second, or transcription was found here to be unbiased with respect to any particular or subgroup in ectopic tissues , as indicated by the approximate fit to a poisson distribution. we note, though, that other studies have reported up to 300-fold difference in the levels of ors transcription in mouse olfactory epithelium  <cit> . last, or pseudogenes were found here to be expressed in ectopic tissues at similar levels to those of intact genes. in contrast, in olfactory epithelium, where chemosensory functionality is expected, or pseudogenes were found to be significantly less expressed than intact genes  <cit> . in spite of this, our results can neither exclude nor confirm the possibility that some ors do have a function in ectopic tissues, as the functionally-related transcription might be concealed within the relatively noisy microarray data.

the relative weight of neutral evolution and purifying selection in shaping gene expression changes is controversial. based on the expression data that have accumulated lately, a predominantly neutral model of evolution for gene expression has been proposed  <cit> . on the other hand, others  <cit>  have recently indicated the parallel importance of selective constraints. the neutral model was previously supported by a lack of correlation between gene expression profiles and gene sequence divergence  <cit> , a general observation that is in line with our own results. also, similar rates of divergence in gene expression levels between humans and chimpanzees were found for intact and expressed pseudogenes  <cit> , again echoing the results reported here.

recently, ectopic expression and its evolutionary significance have been reviewed  <cit> . the authors propose that transcription regulation is leaky due to the need to decondense chromatin and the limited number of transcription factors in the cell. they suggest that ectopic expression, which appears randomly, may have evolutionary potential and provide an opportunity to develop protein function diversification . the same might be true for or genes, a point that will have to be further explored.

the 7e subfamily
the or gene subfamily 7e has expanded extensively in the primate lineage, composing ~10% of the human and chimpanzee or repertoires. in humans, all its members but one are pseudogenes  <cit> . it was suggested that the subfamily expansion occurred through a complex mechanism of large segmental duplications, and that the duplication unit included one 7e subfamily member from each of the two phylogenetic clades of the subfamily  <cit> . our results suggest that one of these two genes had already a disrupted promoter when the expansion started. the unusually high expression level of the second clade may be the result of mutations enhancing expression. it is also possible that highly expressed 7e members have some potential function after all as previously suggested  <cit> .

or genomic neighborhood
previous reports have shown that adjacent and nearby genes show correlated expression patterns in yeast  <cit> . human genes were shown not to be randomly distributed in the genome; highly expressed genes and weakly expressed genes tend to populate different chromosomal domains  <cit> . it has been suggested that co-expressed genes in eukaryotic genomes reflect the domain organization of chromatin  <cit> . we have noticed that ors located within the range of  <dig>  m from non-or genes have a higher tendency to be expressed than others, hinting that the genomic environment may partially influence or gene expression. this is further supported by the expression of an or gene in erythroid cells, attributed to its genomic location in the transcriptionally active chromatin domain of the extended β-globin gene cluster  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we reported on widespread ectopic or expression. related observations have formed the basis for proposing specific roles for ors in non-olfactory tissues. we proposed an additional explanation for ectopic expression, a neutral or near neutral model of evolution for at least part of or transcription regulation in non-olfactory tissues. this is supported by the uniform overall transcription level in most tissues, the heterogeneity in its patterns, the expression level proportion similarity in or intact and disrupted genes and the total lack of correlation between human and mouse orthologous ors.
