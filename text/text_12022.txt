BACKGROUND
the mitochondrion is the organelle responsible for cellular respiration and energy production in many eukaryotic organisms. in addition to its role in cellular function, the mitochondrion contains an internalised, usually circular genome  which is separate to, but co-operates with, the nuclear genome  <cit> . knowledge about mt genomes and their structure provides a basis for investigating intracellular physiology and biochemistry  <cit> , and gives insights into mt disorders/diseases caused by mt gene mutations  <cit> . also, because the mt genome is relatively large, the genome structure is highly conserved, and many of the mt genes are highly variable, genetic markers in mt genomes are useful for taxonomic, ecological, population genetic and evolutionary studies . however, for some groups of organisms, particularly invertebrates, there is very limited information on mt genomes, which most likely relates to the inaccessibility of a practical, generally applicable and cost-effective technique for mt genome sequencing. in the past, mt genome sequencing relied mainly on the purification of mtdna from the organism under study and its subsequent cloning   <cit> , sequencing and sequence assembly to then determine the genome structure and gene order. for vertebrates and large invertebrates, where microgram or milligram amounts of mtdna can be isolated and purified from individuals, this conventional procedure is effective. however, for small invertebrates, such as tiny parasitic worms , the amount of mtdna which can be purified from individuals is much too small to use this approach. also, there can be major problems with extensive sequence variation among individuals and/or at-richness   <cit> , preventing accurate sequence determination. an effective long pcr-based method has been established for the amplification and subsequent sequencing from individuals via primer walking  <cit> . however, it has not yet been possible to directly sequence an entire mt genome sequence in a single reaction.

with the recent focus on the sequencing of complete nuclear genomes has come a substantial interest in the development of high-throughput, low cost sequencing platforms capable of much more substantial sequence outputs than has been possible with conventional sequencers. a particularly promising approach is the "massively parallel picolitre reactor platform"   <cit> . the maximum total sequence length which can be determined using this method is presently ~ <dig> mbp  <cit> , which vastly exceeds the total length of the mt genome. a recent study  <cit>  demonstrated that  <dig> technology is more reliable than a conventional  approach for sequencing highly at-rich regions, suggesting that this approach could enhance long pcr-based mt genome sequencing. moreover, the final sequence output obtained via the  <dig> platform can be assembled as one or more contigs from a very large number of short overlapping sequence reads, this platform may offer a more accurate output due to substantial coverage and improved bioinformatic processing following sequencing.

in the present study, we utilized a long-pcr-coupled  <dig> technological approach to sequence the complete mt genome from a small portion of the genomic dna from a single adult of haemonchus contortus . this nematode represents a blood-feeding parasite of paramount importance, as a pathogen in small ruminants , causing anaemia and associated complications, leading to death in severely affected animals  <cit>  and belongs to a group of nematodes  parasitising animals, which cause major disease problems, resulting in substantial economic losses to agricultural and livestock industries worldwide. in order to validate sequencing by this approach, we used mt data for h. contortus mined from public databases as a scaffold for mapping and assembly. also, we characterized the mt genome of this important parasite and compared its genome structure with previously published mt genomes for other strongylid nematodes.

RESULTS
molecular verification of species identity, and quality of long-pcr amplicons
a sample of total genomic dna was isolated from a single adult male of h. contortus  for the sequencing of the complete mt genome. in order to ensure the specific identity of the specimen prior to sequencing, the second internal transcribed spacer  of nuclear ribosomal dna was amplified from the genomic dna sample by the pcr and sequenced directly. the sequence obtained was identical to the its- <dig> sequence published previously for h. contortus . subsequently, the complete mt genome was amplified by long-pcr from the genomic dna in two overlapping regions   <cit> . each amplicon appeared as one abundant band of the appropriate size on an agarose gel. short tags  were sequenced from the  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb amplicons  to verify their specificity and identity. following dna quantitation for each amplicon, the two amplicons  were pooled and sequenced directly in a single reaction using  <dig> technology .

validation of sequencing via  <dig> technology by comparison with data mined from public databases
the recently developed  <dig> technology platform  <cit>  has been utilized for the sequencing of the complete nuclear genomes from a range of organisms  <cit> . although, prior to the present study, it had not been applied to mt genomes of nematodes, a study of marine microbes  <cit>  has shown this technology  to be particularly suited for sequencing at-rich regions with complex secondary structures, yielding higher quality sequences and costing less overall to carry out than sanger sequencing alone. this information indicated that  <dig> technology was perfectly suited to the at-rich mt genomes of strongylid nematodes, but this required verification.

the mt genome sequence  of h. contortus determined using  <dig> technology was automatically assembled into one contig of  <dig>  bp. this sequence was then compared with extensive mt gene sequences available in public databases. for this comparison, ests  from  <dig> different cdna libraries, constructed from various lifecycle stages or tissues of h. contortus  <cit>  available via  <cit>   and  <cit>   were mined for mt gene data. in total,  <dig> ests were obtained  and found to have high similarity  to the sequences of protein coding genes of the h. contortus in the mitochondrial genome determined in the present study. an examination of the number of ests obtained for each protein coding mitochondrial gene  revealed that cox <dig>  is much more highly represented than any other gene . the cox <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes are also highly represented . given the number of est reads contained within these libraries  and the random nature in which est reads are generated , it seems reasonable to infer that the relative proportion of the currently available est contigs for h. contortus which match each mitochondrial gene are related to the relative abundance of the mrna transcripts for each gene in vitro.

abased on unannotated  est data from public databases

in addition to mining est data from online databases, gss data  were mined for mt gene sequences using an unpublished cox <dig> sequence as an in silico-bait. we discovered contigs  <dig>  and  <dig>  which were then mapped against hcmg- <dig> at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels , achieving complete coverage with >  <dig> % similarity at the nucleotide level. of the nucleotide differences,  <dig> were found within protein coding genes. four of these single nucleotide differences between hcmg- <dig> and contigs  <dig> and  <dig> were interpreted to represent intraspecific variation in the nucleotide sequence of the mt genome of this species, as none resulted in an amino acid change. two appeared to be sequencing errors, as they resulted in frameshifts in the inferred amino acid sequence: both were found in the cox <dig> gene and were base-called using alignments against available est data . all other nucleotide alterations  were within non-coding regions.

characteristics of the mt genome of haemonchus contortus and comparative analysis with those from related nematodes
the complete mt genome sequence of haemonchus contortus, hcmg- <dig>  was characterized . it was  <dig>  bp in length and was assembled as a single contig from  <dig>  overlapping sequence reads within the  <dig> sequencing platform. the mt genome of this species is ~300– <dig> bp larger than those characterised for related species , which range from  <dig> – <dig>  kb  <cit> , but is within the range of previously published mt genomes for chromadorean nematodes   <cit> . the larger size relates primarily to an apparent expansion of the at-rich control  as well as the presence of slightly longer non-coding regions between many of the transfer rna genes. the mt genome sequence of h. contortus is at-rich  and exhibits an asymmetrical nucleotide usage:  <dig> % for a,  <dig> % for t,  <dig> % for g and  <dig> % for c in the coding strand . within the strongylida, at-richness in the mt genome has been found to range from  <dig> – <dig> %  <cit> , and, as is observed here for h. contortus, t is the most dominant nucleotide in the coding strand   <cit> . given the at bias  in the mt genome of h. contortus, there is a considerable bias in codon usage. consequently, ata , att , tta , and ttt  were the most commonly used codons , compared with those containing numerous g and/or c residues, such as cgc , gcc  and gcg  . these findings are consistent with previously characterized nematode mt genomes  <cit> .

the gene content of the mt genome of h. contortus is consistent with that reported for other chromadorean nematodes  <cit>  in having  <dig> protein coding genes , the nicotinamide dehydrogenase subunits 1– <dig> , cytochrome b  and adenosine triphosphatase subunit  <dig> ),  <dig> transfer rna  genes  and the small   and large  ribosomal subunits . as for other chromadorean nematodes studied to date  <cit> , no adenosine triphosphatase subunit  <dig>  gene is present, and all genes are predicted to be transcribed from the same strand and in the same direction. examination of the overall genome structure revealed that the h. contortus mt genome has gene arrangement ga <dig>  which is consistent with all previously published mt genomes for the strongylida  <cit>  and some rhabditida .

although the mt genome of h. contortus is highly at-rich, this richness is not distributed evenly . like other chromadorean mt genomes characterised to date  <cit> , the mt genome of h. contortus contains an at-rich  region which, as the name denotes, has the highest content of a and t nucleotides  for any region in this genome. the rrnl and rrns genes are also highly at-rich , consistent with other nematodes  <cit> . the protein coding genes with the highest at content are nad2- <dig> and nad4l, in accordance with the species of strongylida characterised to date  <cit> . the protein coding genes with the lowest at content are nad <dig>  and cox <dig> . interestingly, although cox <dig> is the gene with the lowest at content in known mt genomes of the strongylida, nad <dig> appears to have a lower at content  in h. contortus relative to an. duodenale, n. americanus and co. oncophora . in the other strongylida, the gene with the next lowest at-richness is cox <dig> .

previous studies of the mt genomes from the strongylida  <cit>  have indicated high variation in the translation initiation and termination codons among the protein coding genes within the mt genome of a single species . within the hookworms, an "att" initiation codon is most common . both of these hookworms also use a "ttg" initiation codon for selected genes. also, an. duodenale uses an "atg" initiation codon for nad <dig> and n. americanus uses an "ata" initiation codon for cox <dig>  the initiation codons used by co. oncophora also appear to be relatively heterogeneous . this is also true for h. contortus with initiation codons ranging from att , ata , ttg , gtt  and aat . the most commonly used termination codon for the h. contortus mt genes is taa , however, tgt , tg , tag  and tt  are used also.

pairwise comparisons of amino acid sequences inferred from coding genes for h. contortus were made with the corresponding sequences from each of the three previously characterised strongylida  . the overall amino acid sequence similarity ranged from  <dig> – <dig> %. the predicted proteins with the greatest similarity were cox <dig> , cox <dig>  and cox <dig> . the proteins with the least similarity were nad <dig>  and nad <dig> . the ranking from least to most variable is: cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  atp <dig>  cytb, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad4l, nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig>  in addition to encoding the most conserved protein, the cox <dig> gene is also the least at-rich, suggesting that it is an attractive target for the design of relatively conserved primers, which may also apply to the genes cox <dig> and cox <dig>  interestingly, six of the  <dig> peptides  inferred from the mt genome sequence of h. contortus  are more similar in sequence to those of the two hookworms , an. duodenale and n. americanus, than for co. oncophora . unlike the mt genome sequences characterised for an. duodenale  <cit> , n. americanus  <cit>  and h. contortus , which were obtained from individual specimens, the mt genome of co. oncophora was sequenced from pooled larvae  <cit> . an examination of the nucleotide sequence provided for this species reveals a range of single nucleotide polymorphisms  scattered throughout various genes  <cit> . it is likely that these snps have contributed to ambiguity in the translated amino acid sequence used and examined in the present study, and may explain the discrepancy between the amino acid sequence similarities and the current taxonomic relationships of these strongylid species. also, because the mt genome of co. oncophora was determined from pooled larvae rather than single worms, there is some potential that the sample sequenced contained one or more heterologous species of strongylid. therefore, to prevent any sequence ambiguity, it is recommended that single, morphologically identified adult male nematodes are used for mt genome sequencing.

all circular nematode mt genomes described to date have been found to contain  <dig> trn genes  <cit> , and h. contortus is no exception . the trn genes for this species range from 53– <dig> bp, which is consistent with other nematodes  <cit> . the secondary structure of the trns genes consists of a 7– <dig> bp amino-acyl arm and a  <dig> bp anticodon stem, with a t/u residue always preceding, and a purine always following the anticodon. twenty of the  <dig> trns genes were found to have a 3– <dig> bp dhu arm with a 5– <dig> bp dhu loop and a 6– <dig> bp tv-replacement loop instead of a tψc arm. the two exceptions to this are the two serine  trns genes which have a  <dig> bp dhu replacement loop instead of the dhu arm, and a 3– <dig> bp tψc arm with a 4– <dig> bp tψc loop instead of the tv replacement loop. these findings are consistent with the trns genes described for all  <dig> chromadorean nematodes characterised to date  <cit> .

the rrns and rrnl genes of h. contortus were consistent in length  with those reported previously for most nematodes  <cit> , showing 77–78% and 75–76% sequence similarity, respectively, with homologous sequences from an. duodenale, n. americanus and co. oncophora. the secondary structures for rrns  and rrnl  were inferred by mapping against the appropriate secondary structures for n. americanus  <cit> , originally based on escherichia coli models  <cit>  and predicting, either manually or through computer assisted predictions , changes caused by various mutations.

in accordance with the two known hookworm mt genomes  <cit> , the rrns structure consists of four relatively conserved domains  bound by numerous conserved helices  <cit> . a  <dig> nt insert between positions 187– <dig>  apparently interacts with a  <dig> nt tract between positions 305– <dig>  and is predicted to result in a slight alteration of the secondary structure between conserved elements  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , resulting in an extension of the stem between elements  <dig> and  <dig> and the formation of a  <dig> bp and a  <dig> bp stem loop between elements  <dig> and  <dig> . although the secondary structure of the rrns of co. oncophora was not characterised previously  <cit> , the sequence did not reveal the  <dig> nt tract identified in h. contortus. whether this inferred alteration in the rrns structure in h. contortus is unique to this and/or to closely related species remains to be elucidated.

the rrnl secondary structure predicted for h. contortus is consistent with those predicted for an. duodenale and n. americanus  <cit>  and consists of four major stem-loop domains   which appear to be conserved  <cit> . the amino-acyl trn binding sites  and peptidyl-transferase sites , first described from escherichia coli by noller et al.  <cit>  and later recognized in nematodes  <cit> , are present. hu et al.  <cit>  found that, although these "a" and "p" binding sites were present in hookworms, the exit site  proposed by noller et al.  <cit>  was not found in the rrnl of the hookworms or ascaris sp., ca. elegans, onchocerca volvulus or trichinella spiralis  <cit> . also, no e site was found within the secondary structure of the rrnl of h. contortus, demonstrating consistency with previous findings and lending further support to the hypothesis that many nematode rrnl genes do not have a recognizable exit site  <cit>  or, at least, not one comparable with that of e. coli  <cit> . although the secondary structure of the rrnl of co. oncophora has not been reported previously  <cit> , the sequence similarity  among the rrnl genes of h. contortus, an. duodenale and n. americanus suggests a conserved secondary structure for these strongylida.

the  <dig> genes of the h. contortus mt genome comprise ~94% of the entire mt genome. the remaining ~6% consists of non-coding regions, which are predicted to be functionally involved in the regulation of transcription, translation and/or replication  <cit> . the largest of these non-coding regions is the at-rich region, which is  <dig> bp in length . as for other nematodes with the gene arrangement ga <dig>  <cit> , this region was located between the nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes. also, like other ga <dig> nematodes, the at-rich region in h. contortus is flanked  by the trna gene and  by the genes trnp and trnv, and a short  non-coding region between genes trnp and trnv. this region is 157– <dig> bp longer than the corresponding region reported for an. duodenale , n. americanus   <cit>  and co. oncophora   <cit> . however, as described by hu et al.  <cit> , the at-rich region is likely to exhibit significant intraspecific length polymorphism. as for hookworms  <cit> , in h. contortus, this region exhibits a complex stem-loop formation , hypothesized to be involved in mt replication in the mt genome  <cit> . in addition to having complex secondary structure, the at-rich region can contain repetitive elements. the at-rich region of ca. elegans contains six repeats  of an identical  <dig> nucleotide sequence  <cit> . although such a repetitive element was not found in the mt genomes of an. duodenale or n. americanus  <cit> , regions believed to represent remnants of these repeats have been found in the mt genome of ascaris sp., in the same study as that of ca. elegans  <cit> . in the present study, the at-rich region of h. contortus does not contain the repetitive element described for ca. elegans. however, a sequence alignment of the at-rich regions from these two species did indicate that some of the "tat" portions  <cit>  of the repetitive elements described for ca. elegans may be present. lastly, hu et al.  <cit>  described a poly-a  region within the at-rich region of all chromadorean nematodes characterised at the time. a similar poly-a region is present in the at-rich region of h. contortus . it has been hypothesized  <cit>  that such poly-a region are involved in mt gene replication, as proposed for poly-t regions found in the control region for some vertebrate and insect species  <cit> . this proposal warrants experimental investigation.

another non-coding region between cox <dig> and nad <dig> has been described from all previously characterized nematodes exhibiting gene arrangement ga <dig>  <cit> , namely an. duodenale, n. americanus, as. suum, s. carpocapsae and ca. elegans. in the latter three nematodes, this region forms a stem-loop structure  <cit> . however, the region does not appear to form a stem loop structure in an. duodenale nor in n. americanus  <cit> , and does not appear to form a stem loop in the h. contortus mt genome reported herein. in addition, nematodes with gene arrangement ga <dig>  presently represented by the filarial nematodes , o. volvulus  <cit>  and d. immitis  <cit> ) from which complete mt genomes have been described, also have a gene order juxtaposed such that the cox <dig> gene follows the 3' end of nad <dig>  there is no non-coding region between these two genes. this information suggests that if secondary structure in the non-coding region between cox <dig> and nad <dig> is involved in regulating replication, transcription and/or translation, it is not a universal requirement for all nematodes. hu et al.  <cit>  found a third non-coding region between the genes nad <dig> and nad <dig> . a similar region is present in h. contortus. in an. duodenale, this region was inferred to form a  <dig> bp and a  <dig> bp stem-loop  <cit> , and it is proposed to be involved in interactions with rna processing enzymes, as has been reported for similar stem-loop structures in humans  <cit> . no such secondary structure was found for ne. americanus  <cit> , nor was it predicted here for the corresponding region in h. contortus. the degree to which such structures are involved in regulating molecular events in the mitochondria of nematodes in not yet clear and is an exciting area for future research.

 <dig> technology as a high-throughput method for sequencing mitochondrial genomes
the present study demonstrates the utility of the  <dig> technology platform for the sequencing of at-rich mt genomes combined with mapping against a scaffold of available sequences mined from public est and/or gss databases. this approach represents a "scaled-down" version used for sequencing complete nuclear genomes  <cit>  and overcomes the significant limitations of sequencing at-rich templates using conventional approaches  <cit> . presently, the equipment costs associated with this platform are likely to be prohibitive for most laboratories. consequently, most laboratories will likely utilise commercial services if employing this method. in terms of cost, sequencing of a small number of mt genomes using this platform is probably not directly competitive with conventional sanger sequencing via primer walking and/or cloning. however, if one considers the vast improvements, in terms of efficiency, in relation to the complete sequencing and sequence assembly of these genomes, we contend that this approach is a practical alternative.

the period from genomic dna extraction to the final output of a complete, assembled mt genome takes ~2– <dig> weeks. in research applications, where a panel of conserved primers is available for primer walking, this level of output is probably achievable. however, for applications where such primers are not available  and must be designed de novo based on sequencing results, this present approach has major advantages. equally, shotgun cloning-based sequencing would not be as efficient, unless a high-throughput  system were available for the rapid isolation of large numbers of clones for plasmid purification and subsequent sequencing to ensure adequate coverage of the mt genome, thus substantially increasing costs. furthermore, by either a primer walking or shotgun cloning approach, a significant amount of bioinformatic processing is required for contig assembly following sequencing, which is not required using the  <dig> platform because contig assembly is automated. economically, if  <dig> technology is applied as a high-throughput system in which multiple mt genomes are sequenced simultaneously, the direct costs per such genome  becomes directly comparable with, if not less expensive than other approaches. the benefits in terms of efficiency presented by this technology are considered substantial.

in addition to cost and efficiency benefits, the  <dig> sequencing method may provide greater reliability in the sequence output  which will likely improve as newer versions  of the sequencing platform and assembly software are made available. given the cost and laborious nature of primer walking and/or conventional cloning-based methods, most mt genomes presently available have been assembled as a single contig following uni- or bi-directional sequencing, resulting in a one- to two-fold coverage of the genome . the sequencing of large numbers of overlapping sequences generated from a template using the  <dig> technology offers a substantial increase in coverage. in the present study, the complete mt genome was assembled from ~ <dig>  overlapping sequences, each read being ~ <dig> bp  <cit> . this translates into a total sequence output from one reaction of ~ <dig>  bp, resulting in substantial "coverage" of the mitochondrial genome, which would be impractical, too laborious and costly to achieve using conventional sequencing approaches.

previously, it has been suggested that the  <dig> technology may be less reliable for sequencing homopolymeric and repetitive elements  <cit> , which have been detected previously in the mt genomes of nematodes, particularly in the at-rich region  <cit> . in the mt genome of h. contortus determined,  <dig> such regions  were identified, but there was no evidence  of any problems herein with sequencing through such elements. in the present study, the discovery of a complete mt genome sequence for h. contortus in a gss database allowed the direct evaluation of the  <dig> sequencing output, and did not reveal any sequencing errors. as homopolymeric and repetitive elements can occur in the at-rich region and elsewhere, it may be warranted, for organisms for which no prior sequence data are available, to undertake conventional sanger sequencing to independently verify the accuracy of such sequence elements determined by  <dig> technology.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates clearly the utility and practicality of  <dig> technology for the sequencing of mt genomes. the high-throughput capacity of this approach provides unique prospects for large-scale mt sequencing projects as a foundation for population genetic, evolutionary and ecological studies  <cit> . the present investigation also discovered substantial amounts of mt data present in est and gss data sets for h. contortus, suggesting that databases available for other species will provide a useful resource for the mining of data to assist in the annotation, assembly and analyses of mt genome sequence data.
