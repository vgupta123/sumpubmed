BACKGROUND
high-density genotyping arrays have become established as a valuable research tool in human genetics. currently, more than  <dig> genome-wide association studies of humans were published, reporting about  <dig>  snps that are associated with a phenotype  <cit> . also in animal sciences, high-density genotyping arrays are harnessed to analyze genetic variation  <cit> . to exploit the full potential of this technology, snps on the chips should be well characterized and especially their chromosomal position should be precisely known. however, this is a challenge, if the snps are not so-called reference snps and if the genome sequence is still subject to changes. if reference identifiers  are known, the position of oligomers can be updated comfortably through biomart  <cit> . otherwise, oligomer position tracking is possible via aligning the oligomer sequences to the genome sequence. in this work, we describe such a mapping strategy in detail so that a scientist with moderate bioinformatics knowledge can reproduce it. furthermore, we present a case study in which we mapped  <dig>  oligomer sequences from illumina's bovinesnp <dig> beadarray  <cit>  to the bovine genome.

RESULTS
 <dig>  of  <dig>   oligomer sequences had a single megablast hit and could therefore be assigned to both a chromosome and a position unambiguously .  <dig>  oligomer sequences  had no hits, and  <dig>  had multiple hits.  <dig> of these  <dig> oligomer sequences had a clear best hit and could therefore be assigned both to a chromosome and a position.  <dig> had hits with an equally high bitscore on one and the same chromosome but at different positions. they were assigned to a chromosome but not to a position.  <dig> had hits with an equally high bitscore but on different chromosomes. they were assigned neither to a chromosome nor to a position. altogether, we mapped  <dig>   oligomer sequences to a unique chromosomal position,  <dig>  to a chromosome but not to a position, and  <dig>   neither to a chromosome nor to a position . for comparison, the corresponding figures according to illumina were  <dig>  ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   for oligomers with a unique position, for oligomers with a chromosome but without position, and for oligomers without chromosome and position, respectively . we wrote an r-script  <cit>  to perform an extensive comparison between illumina's and our mapping annotation . in  <dig> cases, illumina assigned oligomers to a chromosome, while our mapping procedure did not. in  <dig> cases, the situation was vice versa . next, we examined all  <dig>  snps assigned to a unique chromosome by both illumina and our mapping procedure. in five cases , the oligomers were assigned a different chromosome by illumina and our mapping procedure. in  <dig> cases, snps were given a unique locus in illumina's annotation but not by this mapping procedure; in  <dig> cases, the situation was vice versa . we then examined if the positions provided by illumina and by our mapping procedure differed in case the chromosomal annotation was consistent and, if so, to what extent.  <dig>  snps had a unique chromosomal position, according to both illumina and this mapping procedure. in  <dig>  cases, the positions differed by three or more base pairs. in  <dig>  cases, the positions were exactly identical, and in  <dig>   cases, the positions differed by one base pair . this can probably be attributed to differences in the mapping procedures applied by illumina and by us. we consider the following cases substantial discrepancies between illumina's annotation and our results:

numbers of bovinesnp <dig> oligomer sequences mapped to the btau <dig> genome assembly according to illumina and according to the re-mapping procedure in this study.

shown are the numbers of snps without  and with  chromosomal assignment according to illumina and this study.

shown are the numbers of  <dig>  snps that were mapped to the same chromosome in this study and by illumina without  and with  chromosomal position, according to illumina and this study. in  <dig> cases, snp positions were identical, in  <dig>  there was a shift of one base pair, in  <dig> there was a shift of two, and in  <dig> cases, there was a shift of three of more base pairs.

• oligomers were mapped to a chromosome by illumina but not by our mapping procedure  or vice versa 

• oligomers mapped to one and the same chromosome by illumina and by our procedure but mapped to a unique locus by illumina and not by us  or vice versa 

• oligomers mapped to two different chromosomes by illumina and by our procedure 

• oligomers mapped to one and the same chromosome by illumina and by our procedure but mapped to loci more than two bases apart 

altogether, there were substantial changes for  <dig> snps . finally, we checked if oligomer sequences were represented on the chip more than once . we found  <dig> cases, where one and the same oligomer sequence was assigned to two different oligomer identifiers . these  <dig> snp pairs can be used to assess the genotyping quality. we also compared all oligomer sequences against their reverse-complementary sequences using the r-library seqinr <cit>  but found no case of duplication.

discussion
the underlying genome build was btau <dig>  for both illumina's annotation and for our mapping procedure, which makes it difficult to find reasons for the discrepancies. one reason could be that minor changes are incorporated into the genome sequence by the genome database curators without altering the build version. another reason could be that the mapping methods differ. although the extent of deviations might appear small, incorrect positions of oligomers can lead to artifacts in subsequent analyses like linkage disequilibrium studies or the establishment of candidate gene lists. the given examples illustrate that snp oligomers that are mapped to different genomic locations may lead to completely functionally different inferences based on gene annotations. it is to be expected that further adjustment is necessary as the bovine genome proceeds to be completed. currently, 90% of the bovine sequence is assigned to the  <dig> autosomes and the x chromosome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our case study has shown that discrepancies between the initially determined positions and the positions determined at a later time can occur. these discrepancies can make the correct association of an oligomer with a gene difficult. above all, the classification of an snp as e.g. non-synonymous coding, synonymous coding or as splice site snp is critically dependent on its exact chromosomal position.

in a case study with illumina's bovinesnp <dig> beadchip we found that almost 2% of the oligomer positions deviated substantially between the annotations given by the manufacturer and determined in our mapping procedure. given the relatively easy realization of the mapping procedure described here, it is recommended to verify the manufacturer's data and adjust them, if necessary.

we furthermore would like to point out that the verification of results obtained by snp or expression arrays can be considerably facilitated if the oligomer sequences are made available to the scientific community.
