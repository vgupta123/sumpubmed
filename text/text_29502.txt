BACKGROUND
in chicken, ovarian function determines laying performance. it has been estimated that approximately  <dig>  oocytes are present in the hen ovary when sexually mature, but only a few hundred oocytes are selected to reach maturity and ovulate. usually, the functionally mature hen ovary contains hundreds of white cortical follicles with 1–5 mm in diameter, 5– <dig> small yellow pre-hierarchical follicles with 6–8 mm in diameter and 5– <dig> large yellow preovulatory hierarchy follicles with 9–40 mm in diameter  <cit> . in the hen ovary, a single follicle is selected into the preovulatory hierarchy from a small cohort of pre-hierarchical follicles approximately once a day  <cit> . the preovulatory follicles are arranged in a hierarchical order in which the largest one  represents the most mature and will ovulate for egg formation first. ovary development and folliculogenesis undergo a series of complex processes including modulation of gonadotropin action, steroid hormones biosynthesis, follicle selection, granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation, which require tightly regulated expression and interaction of a multitude of genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels  <cit> .

micrornas  are a class of endogenous non-coding small regulatory rnas of 19– <dig> nucleotides in size  <cit>  that can regulate gene expression by targeting specific sites in the 3′-untranslated region  of mrnas  <cit> . the seed region, which is located at mirna nucleotides 2– <dig> from the 5′ end of a mirna sequence, is the most important sequence for interaction with mrna targets  <cit> . increasing evidence indicates that mirnas play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and have been shown to control multiple biological and metabolic processes such as organogenesis, development, cell proliferation and differentiation as well as many diseases  <cit> . the mechanism of mirna regulated gene expression is very complex because one mirna can target several thousand mrnas, and one mrna can be regulated by several mirnas  <cit> . identifying the expression patterns of mirnas in the hen ovary is the first step to elucidating their functions in ovarian development and folliculogenesis. several studies have demonstrated that inactivation of dicer <dig> can result in accelerated early follicle recruitment and degeneration as well as infertility and the dysfunction of oocyte maturation and ovulation  <cit> . furthermore, genome-wide mirna expression has been examined in the ovaries of mice  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , pig  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> . these studies show that mirnas play a critical role in the development of mammalian gonads, but little is known about the involvement of mirnas in adult chicken ovary and follicle development. the aim of this study was to identify the differentially expressed mirnas in sexually mature and immature chicken ovaries by using illumina small rna deep sequencing . this approach is highly suited for small rna discovery, which not only provides sequences of low abundance species but also provides quantitative data as the frequency of sequencing reads reflects the abundance of mirnas in the population  <cit> . finally, we validated and identified the expression pattern of gga-mir-1a,  <dig>  26a,  <dig> and  <dig> at different developmental stages of ovary and follicles of various sizes using qrt-pcr. these results may help us to further understand how ovarian function is regulated by mirnas.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of small rnas in chicken ovary
to survey mirnas involved in the maturity of the chicken ovary, two small rna libraries were generated from 42-d and 162-d chicken ovaries that, respectively, represent sexually immature and mature ovaries, and the libraries were sequenced by illumina small rna deep sequencing technology. in total,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained from the sexually mature  and sexually immature  ovary libraries, respectively. after filtering the low-quality sequences, empty adaptors and single-read sequences,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads of 18– <dig> nt were selected for further analysis from the sexually mature  and sexually immature  ovary libraries, respectively. among the selected reads,  <dig> , <dig> sequences from the mature ovary and  <dig> , <dig> sequences from the immature ovary mapped perfectly to the chicken genome , amounting to  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total reads, respectively; and  <dig> , <dig> reads in mature and  <dig> , <dig> reads in immature ovaries were found to be similar to mirnas. the rest of the sequences were found to be other types of rna, including noncoding rna, trna, rrna, snrna or snorna. the number and proportions of the categories of small rnas found are given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

the size distribution of small rnas  was similar in the two libraries, and the majority of them were from  <dig> to  <dig> nt . the most abundant size class was  <dig> nt, which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total reads in sexually mature and immature chicken ovaries, respectively, followed by  <dig> nt  and  <dig> nt .

identification of known mirnas in chicken ovary
to investigate the expression of known mirnas in the chicken ovary, small rna sequences identified by illumina small rna deep sequencing were compared with known mature mirnas and precursors in mirbase . the results showed that  <dig> mature mirna,  <dig> mirna*,  <dig> mirna-5p and  <dig> mirna-3p were found in the two libraries, and  <dig> known mirnas are co-expressed in the two libraries .

the illumina small rna deep sequencing approach allows us to determine the relative abundance of various mirna families by calculating the sequencing frequency. a highly expressed mirna will likely have a large number of sequenced clones  <cit> . in the mature and immature chicken ovary libraries, known mirnas had a broad range of expression levels; some  were found to have more than hundreds of thousands of sequence reads, while others  had less than  <dig> , indicating that expression varies significantly among different mirna families. the proportion of different categories of small rnas often reflects the roles in a particular tissue or different developmental stages and their associated biological mechanisms. the following  <dig> mirnas were dominantly expressed in the two libraries: gga-mir-10a, gga-mir-146c, gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir- <dig>  gga-let-7a, gga-let-7b, gga-let-7c, gga-let-7j, gga-let-7f, gga-let-7 k, gga-mir-30a-5p, gga-mir-30e, gga-mir-148a, gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir- <dig>  each of these  <dig> mirnas had more than  <dig>  reads, while the majority of other mirnas sequenced had more than  <dig> reads. the most abundant mirna in the mature ovary was gga-mir-10a, which had  <dig> , <dig> reads, followed by gga-mir- <dig>  which had  <dig>  reads. however, in the immature ovary, gga-let-7a  and gga-let-7j  were the most abundant . sequence analysis indicated that the relative abundance of members within one mirna family varied greatly in the chicken ovary, suggesting functional divergence within the family. for example, in the immature ovary, gga-let- <dig> family abundance varied from  <dig> reads  to  <dig>  reads . similarly, other mirna families exhibited vast read ranges, such as the gga-mir <dig>  and gga-mir- <dig>  families . these results indicate that different members within one mirna family can have clearly different expression levels, most likely due to tissue- or developmental stage-specific expression.

in the two developmental stages of the chicken ovary, a total of  <dig> mirna*s were co-expressed . it has been demonstrated that the mirna* is generally less stable than their mature mirna counterparts. during the biogenesis of the mature mirnas, some of the mirna* strands are degraded rapidly  <cit> . generally, the mirna* has lower expression levels than their corresponding mature mirnas. in our data, the majority of mirna*s had much fewer reads than their corresponding mature mirnas. one intriguing exception was gga-mir-140*, which was present as  <dig>  reads in the mature ovary and  <dig>  reads in the immature ovary; however, gga-mir- <dig> had only  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads in each library, respectively. similar expression patterns were found for gga-mir-199* and gga-mir-202* . another interesting case was gga-mir-551*, in which only mirna* was detected. these results suggest that mirna*s may play some functional roles during chicken ovary development.

mirnas differentially expressed in sexually mature and immature chicken ovaries
the main purpose of the study was to identify mirnas involved in chicken ovary and follicle development. according to the changes in relative mirna abundance between the two libraries,  <dig> mirnas were expressed significantly differently between sexually mature and immature ovaries . in comparison with the sexually immature ovary ,  <dig> mirnas were significantly up-regulated, and  <dig> mirnas were significantly down-regulated in the sexually mature ovary   . the majority of differentially expressed mirnas range from a 2- to 4-fold difference, and only  <dig> mirnas showed differences greater than 4-fold between the two libraries . among the up-regulated mirnas, gga-mir-1a had the highest fold-change with  <dig> -fold. among the down-regulated mirnas, gga-mir- <dig> had the highest fold-change with  <dig> -fold, followed by gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir-458b, gga-mir-449c and gga-mir-124a with more than 6-fold . in addition, we found that two members of the let- <dig> mirna family, gga-let-7b and gga-let-7 g, exhibited significantly differential expression, although the fold-changes were lower at  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively.

** represents fold change > <dig> or fold change<- <dig>  and p-value< <dig> .

to validate the illumina small rna deep sequencing data, five differentially expressed mirnas  were selected, and their expression levels were quantified using real-time quantitative rt-pcr . the results were consistent with the deep sequencing data . these results provide evidence that illumina small rna deep sequencing is a sensitive and reliable approach to identifying differentially expressed mirnas in the chicken ovary.

developmental expression patterns of five mirnas in the ovary and follicles
to further characterize the functionality of these differentially expressed mirnas identified from the chicken ovary, the expression levels of gga-mir-1a, gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir-26a, gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir- <dig> were further examined in ovary tissues from 42-, 70-, 90-, 110- and 162-day-old white leghorn hens , as well as in follicles isolated from ovaries of 162-day-old white leghorn hens, namely, a large white follicle , small yellow follicle , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig>  and f <dig>  follicles.

the results showed that some of the mirnas exhibit developmental stage-specific expression patterns in ovarian development . the expression patterns of gga-mir-1a and gga-mir- <dig> were similar in the different developmental stages; relatively lower expression was observed from 42-d to 110-d compared with 162-d and increased dramatically to peak in 162-d. however, the expression dynamics of gga-mir-26a were different; the highest expression level was found in the 42-d ovary, then decreased from 70-d to 110-d, and finally increased in the 162-d ovary although still lower than 42-d. the expression of gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir- <dig> in ovary decreased significantly from 42-d to 162-d.

in follicles , the expression patterns of gga-mir-1a and gga-mir- <dig> were similar; during the development from lw to f <dig>  the expression levels of the two mirnas increased progressively with f <dig> having the highest level, which suggests that gga-mir-1a and gga-mir- <dig> may be involved in the follicular growth or ovulation mechanism in the chicken. for gga-mir-26a and gga-mir- <dig>  the highest expression level was found in the sf  follicle. the expression of gga-mir- <dig> was relatively lower in lw and sf follicles, increased most in the f6-f <dig> follicles and then declined in the f <dig> stage, suggesting an important role of gga-mir-26a and gga-mir- <dig> in hierarchy maintenance of follicles in chicken.

target prediction and function annotation
to further understand the physiological functions and biology processes involved by  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas during ovary development, target prediction was performed by integrating three public databases , and  <dig>  target genes were identified . go annotation and kegg pathway analysis were performed to identify functional modules regulated by these mirnas. the go annotation enrichment results showed that regulation of biological process, cellular metabolic process, developmental process and signal transduction are the most significantly enriched go terms . the kegg pathway analysis revealed  <dig> pathways that were enriched with mirna targets . mapk signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, wnt-signaling pathway insulin signaling pathway and gnrh signaling pathway ranked among the most enriched pathways . although the false-positive predictions always exist, we suggest that these targets have high possibility of being regulated by mirnas in chicken ovary development.

discussion
the illumina deep sequencing platform is efficient for mirna discovery and is widely used to generate small rna profiles in various organisms. in the present study, we obtained detailed mirna profiles of sexually mature  and immature  chicken ovaries using this method. to our knowledge, this is the first report of mirna expression profiles of sexually immature and mature ovaries in the chicken. the sequence analysis showed that the dominant size of small rnas in chicken ovary was  <dig> nt followed by  <dig> and  <dig> nt sequences. this result is typical of dicer-processed small rna products and was consistent with the known 19– <dig> nt range for mirnas. our data are consistent with previous findings in mouse  <cit>  and pig  <cit>  testis and ovary as well as chicken skeletal muscle  <cit>  and somites  <cit> . however, in holstein cattle testis and ovary, the  <dig> nt size is the most abundant, followed by  <dig> nt  <cit> , while another study in bovine ovary indicated that  <dig> nt is the predominant size  <cit> . this is likely caused by difference in species or developmental stages.

in the sexually mature chicken ovary library, gga-mir-10a and gga-mir- <dig> were the two most frequently sequenced mirnas, and the let- <dig> mirna family was another abundant cluster with let-7a being the most abundantly expressed mirna. the let- <dig> mirna family was also expressed abundantly in ovary and oocyte of bovines  <cit> , as well as in murine ovaries and testis  <cit> . furthermore, gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir-1a, gga-mir-146c, gga-mir-148a, gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir-26a and gga-mir-30d were abundant in our sequencing libraries, as has been shown in other animal gonads  <cit> . these mirnas may have important roles in female reproductive physiology. a previous study reported that mir- <dig> was significantly up-regulated in murine granulosa cells before and 4 h after the hcg/lh surge and that it plays a role in preventing apoptosis in periovulatory granulosa cells as they transit to luteal cells. knockdown of mir- <dig> in granulosa cells resulted in increased apoptosis and was associated with a reduced ovulation rate  <cit> . some studies have shown that mir- <dig> was down-regulated by estradiol in mcf <dig> cancer cells  <cit> . in the present study, gga-mir- <dig> exhibited a significant  <dig> -fold increase in a sexually mature ovary compared with an immature ovary, and the highest level was in f <dig> follicles, implying that gga-mir- <dig> plays an important role in sexual maturation in hens.

in this study, gga-let-7b is up-regulated while gga-let-7 g, gga-mir-17-3p gga-mir-30d, gga-mir-29a, gga-mir-26a and gga-mir-181a are all down-regulated in the mature ovary compared with the immature ovary. it has also been reported that mir-30c, let-7a, let-7b and let-7c were up-regulated, while mir-30d, mir-29a and mir-26a were down-regulated in rat granulosa cells treated with fsh for 12 h, which suggests that these mirnas participate in fsh-mediated progesterone biosynthesis of granulosa cells  <cit> . another study showed that a lack of mir17-5p and let-7b resulted in corpus luteum insufficiency and infertility in mice and that exogenous administration of the two mirnas could prevent this phenotype  <cit> . a recent study showed that the activated estrogen receptor can suppress the expression of bax by up-regulating a group of mirnas including hsa-let- <dig> family members in endometrial adenocarcinoma and precancerous lesions  <cit> . in the same study, mir-181a and mir-30d are significantly down-regulated after estradiol treatment.

mir-26a is reported to have anti-apoptotic effects in many cancers  <cit> . in mcf <dig> cancer cells, estradiol can repress mir-26a expression to regulate numerous genes associated with cell growth and proliferation  <cit> . mir-26a was also found to play a role in normal tissue growth and development and to have an impact on cell proliferation and differentiation. one study showed that, during myogenesis, overexpression of mir-26a targets the enhancer of zeste homolog  <dig> , which normally suppresses skeletal muscle differentiation  <cit> . in osteogenesis, mir-26a was found to regulate osteoblast cell growth and differentiation in human adipose tissue-derived stem cells  <cit> . in this study, the highest level of gga-mir-26a was found in sf follicles. sf were to be chosen from pre-hierarchical follicles  to pre-ovulatory hierarchy follicles , therefore, gga-mir-26a is likely associated with the mechanism of recruitment of dominant follicle in chicken.

studies indicated that gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir- <dig>  gga-mir- <dig> and gga-mir-202* may be involved in regulating gonadal differentiation in embryonic chicken gonads  <cit> . reduced mir-202* expression is correlated with reduced expression of the testis-associated genes dmrt <dig> and sox <dig>  and up-regulation of the ovary-associated genes foxl <dig> and cyp19a <dig>   <cit> . foxl <dig> is a critical factor required for ovarian growth and differentiation whose functions include regulating aromatase enzyme expression, inhibins and follistatin gene expression, and granulosa cell development  <cit> . in our study, gga-mir-202* was down-regulated by  <dig> -fold and gga-mir- <dig> was down-regulated by  <dig> -fold in sexually mature ovaries compared with immature ovaries, suggesting they are also involved in the sexual maturity of ovary.

bioinformatic analysis shows that mir- <dig> targets tgif <dig> , zeb <dig>  and bmpr1b, which participate in the regulation of tgf-β signaling  <cit> . tgf-β signaling is critical to folliculogenesis and oogenesis in mammalian ovaries  <cit> . the increase in female mir- <dig> expression in differentiating ovaries can ease repression of tgf-β signaling  <cit> . in this study, gga-mir- <dig> was abundantly expression in chicken ovary and  <dig> putative target genes were involved in tgf-β signaling pathway. study has shown that overexpression of mir- <dig> suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion, and conversely, inhibition of endogenous mir- <dig> function enhanced insulin secretion  <cit> . in this study, gga-mir- <dig> is the largest down-regulated by 11-fold in the mature ovary and  <dig> putative target genes were involved in insulin signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study is the first to examine the mirna expression profile of sexually mature and immature ovaries in chicken, and evaluate mirna function during ovary development and folliculogenesis. we identified  <dig> known mirnas that were differentially expressed in mature and immature chicken ovaries that could exert novel functions in the regulation of ovarian development and folliculogenesis. some mirnas such as gga-mir-1a and gga-mir-21are expressed differentially in immature and mature chicken ovaries as well as among different sized follicles, suggesting an important role in the follicular growth or ovulation mechanism in the chicken. further investigation concerning the function of these mirnas should facilitate our understanding of the regulatory roles of mirnas in regulating chicken ovary and follicle growth. the role of individual mirnas in chicken ovarian development and follicle growth requires further investigation.
