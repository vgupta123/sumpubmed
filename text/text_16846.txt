BACKGROUND
mammalian guanylyl cyclases are key signaling proteins that produce the second messenger cgmp thereby regulating a variety of different processes such as vasodilation, diuresis, vision, and bone growth  <cit> . these cyclases are either membrane bound or are found as soluble forms. members of the membrane guanylyl cyclases  include the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor , heat-stable enterotoxin receptor , and retinal guanylyl cyclases  whereas the soluble version is known as the soluble guanylyl cyclase . cgmp produced by these guanylyl cyclases activates downstream signaling proteins such as cgmp-dependent kinases and cgmp-dependent ion channels  <cit> . the cyclases are all activated by different ligands that are in most cases recognized by the n-terminal portion of the cyclases. therefore, this n-terminal region is quite divergent amongst the different cyclases  <cit> . in contrast, the c-terminal region of all the cyclases have two domains found in all mammalian guanylyl cyclases: the coiled-coil domain  and the adjacent c-terminal catalytic guanylyl cyclase domain . considerable progress has been made on the structural characterization of domains of the receptors, or homologs thereof. these domains include the gc-a receptor hormone-binding domain  <cit> , homologous catalytic guanylyl cyclase domains  <cit> , and domains that are homologous to sgc: ligand binding heme-nitric-oxide-and-oxygen binding domains   <cit> , and the h-noxa/h-noba/pas domain  <cit> . one of the guanylyl cyclase domains that has yet to be structurally characterized is the cc domain and that is the focus of this study.

the mammalian sgc is a heterodimer with an α and β subunits. each subunit has two isoforms, α <dig> α <dig> β <dig> β <dig>  yet the sgcα1β <dig> is the most abundant whereas the sgcα2β <dig> is more predominant in brain tissue  <cit> . the precise role for β <dig> subunit is not fully understood and it could have a dominant negative regulatory role  <cit> . the subunit arrangement for sgcβ <dig> includes the above mentioned c-terminal cc and gc domains as well as an n-terminal no-sensing h-nox/h-nob and adjacent h-noxa/h-noba/pas domains. sgcα <dig> is 30% sequence identical to sgcβ <dig> and has a similar subunit organization except that its n-terminal domain does not contain a heme .

besides heterodimerization, homodimers of sgc homodimers have also been observed for β <dig> <cit> , β <dig>  <cit> , and the less stable α <dig> homodimer  <cit> . sgc homodimers are not active  <cit> , except for the manduca sexta's β <dig> subunit  <cit>  and the sgc β <dig> subunit although the latter's needs non-physiological manganese indicating that it might not be active and/or dimerized under physiological conditions  <cit> . the homo- and heterodimeric forms of sgc are thought to be in a physiological equilibrium  <cit>  with heterodimerization being preferred whereas homodimeric β1β <dig>  <cit>  and α1α <dig> are found to be unstable in vivo  <cit> . understanding the underlying reason for the instability of homodimeric sgc is important as its subunit expression levels are known to change  <cit>  which could lead to uneven subunit levels resulting in unstable sgc homodimers thereby further affecting subunit levels. dimerization within sgc is mediated by at least three inter-domain interactions involving the gc, h-noxa/h-noba, and cc subdomains. the latter two dimerization interactions were found to be the most pronounced and include β <dig> residues 204- <dig>  and residues 379- <dig>  <cit> ; the corresponding regions in sgcα <dig> are also critical for sgc activity  <cit> . recent studies have narrowed down these dimerization regions via deletion studies  <cit>  and even structurally characterized an h-noxa dimer  <cit>  leaving the cc region as the only region to be structurally explored.

the sequence of the cc region of guanylyl cyclases are relatively conserved and are postulated to be part of a larger class called the signaling helix   <cit> . this recent in silico study identifies this novel signaling module in between diverse n-terminal sensory domains and various c-terminal catalytic domains ranging from histidine kinases, pp2c phosphatases, ntrc-like aaa+ atpases, diguanylate cyclases to guanylyl cyclases. although members in this s-helix family share limited but detectable sequence identity among each other, their secondary structures are predicted to be entirely helical. to our knowledge, no s-helix structure has yet been determined so the elucidation of sgc cc s-helix domain would not only contribute to the understanding of guanylyl cyclase hetero- vs homodimerization, activation, domains cross-talk but also provides a structural prototype for the entire s-helix family. we present here the  <dig>  Å crystal structure of the cc region of the sgcβ <dig> 

RESULTS
sgcβ <dig> cc construct form oligomers in solution
the n- and c-terminal boundaries of the rattus norvegicus sgc 348- <dig> cc domain were chosen such that it starts after the pas-like/h-noxa domain and ends before the cyclase domain . this sgc cc monomer has a theoretical pi of  <dig>  and a calculated molecular weight of  <dig> da. we performed analytic gel filtration of the cc construct prior to crystallization experiments to estimate the oligomerization state of this construct . the majority of the cc protein eluted as a  <dig>  kd protein and minor portion as a  <dig>  kd protein. taking into account the non-globular nature of a coiled-coil protein, which makes the protein appear with a larger molecular weight, we assume that the majority of the protein is tetrameric with a minor dimeric species present. similar results were obtained with native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis . efforts regarding the corresponding cc domain in sgcα <dig> to arrive at a heterodimeric cc complex were not successful due to inability of the cc of sgcα <dig> to be expressed.

the sgcβ <dig> cc monomers form an anti-parallel four-helix bundle in crystal
we determined the crystal structure of the rattus norvegicus sgc cc domain  to  <dig>  Å resolution using semet single-anomalous-dispersion -phasing . crystals were initially obtained of the wt sequence but the sad phasing required the introduction of an additional met residue via the i <dig> m mutation. there are  <dig> cc molecules in the asymmetric unit and each monomer contains a long amphipathic a helix aa with  <dig> helical turns followed by a turn and a short helix ab . the turn is initiated by a conserved proline residue, p <dig> . four sgc cc monomers come close together to form an apparent four-helix bundle in an anti-parallel arrangement with two of such tetramers in the asymmetric unit . the overall dimensions of each tetramer is about  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> Å <dig>  the rsgc cc domain is quite charged as 1/ <dig> of its residues are either acidic or basic . the eight monomers are conformationally similar to each other, with root-mean-square deviation  for ca atoms ranging between  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å based on pair-wise structural comparisons . some of the  n-terminal residues, introduced as cloning artifacts  were ordered for each monomer. the two tetramers in the asymmetric unit are similar as a superposition of the two cc 'tetramers' results in a rmsd of  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα atoms. the i <dig> m mutation that was generated for semet phasing is not involved in the dimer or tetramer interface. note that the site of the i <dig> m mutation was chosen carefully as to not to interfere with the predicted a-d pattern of cc dimerization. the i at position  <dig> is also not fully conserved in sgcβ <dig> and can also be a v , or m  suggesting that its mutation to m can be accommodated and will likely not cause a negative effect on dimerization and/or coiled-coil interactions.

inter-monomer analysis of sgcβ <dig> tetramer: dimer of dimers
the interactions between the cc monomers within a tetramer were analyzed using the pisa protein-interface webserver  <cit> . the analysis revealed that the interface buried between certain sets of monomer-monomers is larger compared to others. the ab, cd, ef, and gh interfaces are all larger compared to the ad, bc, eh, and fh interfaces . these differences were even more pronounced for pisa's calculated Δg and Δg-p-value  regarding these dimer interfaces . furthermore, if the short ab helix is removed from the calculations, since it is not part of the long coiled-coil helix, the differences are even larger . the ab and cd interface are packed tighter as well and therefore also have no waters present whereas the ad and bc interfaces do have water molecules present . the tighter packing is evidenced as the ca-ca distances between ca's in a and nearest ca in the b helix compared to the a and d helices are generally larger for the a-d pair : the average ca-ca distances for a:b helices  is  <dig>  Å and for the a:d helices is  <dig>  Å.

these different analyses indicate that the tetrameric cc organization observed is likely comprised of a dimer  of dimers and that the non-physiological tetramer formation can perhaps be attributed to either the absence of the sgca <dig> cc or perhaps the presence of the n-terminal gshm cloning residues of which the non-native methionine  is located at the tetramer interface . this dimer of dimers interpretation is in agreement with the cc dimer being also observed as a minor dimeric species in solution . since the expected cc oligomerization state of guanylyl cyclases is dimeric, we narrow down our subsequent analysis to mainly the cc dimer.

dimer analysis of sgcβ <dig> cc
the cc monomers a and b  form an anti-parallel cc dimer . the side-chain directions of a-helices follow a heptad  repeat in that residue i and i+ <dig> face the same direction. the cc dimer interface is formed predominantly via the a-d pattern residues and the a-d assignment, as obtained from socket  <cit> , is indicated in figure 1b. a large number of the a-d residues are hydrophobic which is the characteristic feature for cc domains. our observed a-d pattern was also predicted by homology modeling of a s-helix  <cit>  whereas the cc of gc-e was modeled to have a different a-d pattern  <cit> . note that the observed a-d pattern for sgcβ <dig> can also be predicted from the sequence alone using pcoils  <cit>  which predicted the same a-d assignment for residues y363-k <dig> with probability of higher than  <dig> . however, the marcoil prediction server  <cit>  yielded a different a-d assignments. these possible ambivalences in a-d assignments could be used by the cc domain for signaling perhaps via rotation of helices as is also postulated to occur in the hamp domain  <cit> .

the cc of sgc harbors known regions found to be critical for dimerization. these include the broadly defined sgca <dig> 367- <dig>  <cit>  and sgcβ <dig> 379- <dig>  <cit>  stretches . a recent deletion study narrowed these regions down to sgcβ <dig> 344- <dig> and 381- <dig> as well as sgca <dig> 440- <dig> which were all found to be important for dimerization  <cit> . sgcβ <dig> 401- <dig> and sgca <dig> 460- <dig> were found to be important for activity but not for dimerization  <cit> . the results from this deletion study are in agreement with our cc dimer structure since the latter two regions  are not found at the dimer interface whereas the other ones are at the dimer interface since they are part of the long aa helix.

the cc domain is found in both mgcs and sgc and other s-helix containing proteins  <cit> . the sequence alignment shows considerable sequence conservation, in particular in the c-terminal half of the s-helix . the helix distance plot  shows the distance between the aa helices in the middle of the cc a:b dimer is closer compared to the distances near the ends of the helices.

cc orientation
the observation that the cc dimeric arrangement is anti-parallel is somewhat unexpected since other groups had suggested a parallel arrangement for guanylyl cyclase cc domains after having carried out molecular modeling studies of a parallel cc dimer  <cit> . our homo-oligomer cc sgcβ <dig> structure is representative of a physiologically present homodimeric sgcβ1β <dig> which, in the full length sgc, was found to be not stable. our structure does not represent the active sgca1β <dig> since it was missing its heterodimeric sgca <dig> cc partner in the crystallization experiment. we therefore explored whether a parallel arrangement was also a possibility in the presence of sgca <dig> cc. cc's either parallel or anti-parallel orientation possibilities were investigated by considering the possibilities of salt-bridge formation, residue preference at a-d positions, and inter-domain constraints.

-potential salt-bridge formation
whereas the a-d positions of a cc are favored to have leucine-like residues to promote cc formation, the residues at the e and g positions can be found to make inter-helix salt-bridges  <cit> : parallel ccs are observed to form g-e' salt-bridges whereas anti-parallel ccs can form g-g' and e-e' salt-bridges. to analyze the possible formations of such salt-bridges in both orientations for both homodimeric sgcβ <dig> and heterodimer sgca1β <dig>  we generated models of the different possible ccs. to generate an anti-parallel heterodimeric sgca1β <dig> aa cc dimer, we used coot  <cit>  to mutate the residues of one of the monomers to the sgca <dig> sequence using the alignment in figure 1b. to obtain a parallel sgcβ <dig> homodimer, we used the coordinates of the parallel rhokinase cc dimer  <cit>  as template for superimposing the sgcβ <dig> cc using the a-d residue assignment as guide. this generated homodimeric cc model was used to make a heterodimeric parallel cc model via changing the residues of one of the monomers into the sgca <dig> sequence using coot. these  <dig> models of aa helix cc dimers were not refined using minimization methods as they merely serve the purpose of visualizing the possibilities of salt-bridge formation of residues at the e and g positions. the following salt-bridges are possible for cc homo-/heterodimers in either a parallel or anti-parallel cc orientation:

-anti-parallel heterodimer g-g' or e-e' salt-bridges:  <dig> 

-anti-parallel homodimer g-g' or e-e' salt-bridges:  <dig> 

-parallel heterodimer g-e' salt-bridges:  <dig> .

-parallel homodimer g-e' salt-bridges: 0

this analysis suggests that only in the parallel cc orientation is there a possible electrostatic attraction benefit of a1β <dig> heterodimer formation compared to β1β <dig> homodimer formation .

-l, v, i, n residue preferences
in addition to electrostatic attraction, the presence of leucine, valine, isoleucine, and asparagine residues at either a or d positions can yield clues regarding the parallel or anti-parallel nature of ccs. based on the analyses of previous dimeric cc structures, the ld:la ratio for parallel was found to be  <dig>  but was  <dig>  for anti-parallel ccs  <cit> . in addition, the same study found that for the branched residues valine and isoleucine, the ratio of a:d was  <dig>  for parallel and only  <dig>  for anti-parallel. this ratio is also in agreement with that the isoleucine residue was found to be difficult to be accommodated at the d position for parallel ccs  <cit> . finally, parallel ccs were found to have a 4-fold preference for asparagine residue at the a position compared to anti-parallel ccs  <cit> . to investigate whether these a/d position preferences can aid in suggesting whether ccs from sgcs and mgcs are parallel or anti-parallel, we analyzed their a-d appearance using the sequence alignment in figure 1b as well as an expanded sgc alignment including  <dig> sgc-only sequences : ld:la = 32: <dig> , a:d = 17: <dig> , and na:nd = 1: <dig> . these results indicate that the a:d appearance of three of the four analyzed residues  suggest that the cc orientation could be parallel .

-inter-domain distance constraints
finally, an additional clue regarding parallel vs anti-parallel ccs can come from the fact that these different orientations would have different distances between their termini which have to still somehow connect to their adjacent domains via intervening residues. we therefore constructed partial composite models of the h-noxa/cc/gc domains with in one case a parallel and the other an anti-parallel cc orientation . the h-noxa dimer and the gc dimer are taken from recently determined crystal structures  <cit>  and part of their sequence is also included in the sequence alignment to show their sequence proximity to the cc . the sequence identity between the ns hnoxa and the sgcβ <dig> h-noxa domain is 35% and the identity between the gc domains of sgcβ <dig> and the mammalian chlamydomonas reinhardtii gc structure is 42%. in the anti-parallel arrangement, the distance between the two n-termini of the cc dimer is ~ <dig> Å whereas the distance between the two c-termini of the h-noxa dimer is only ~ <dig> Å . these differences indicate that each connection would need to stretch about / <dig> =  <dig>  Å. this distance is rather large but can perhaps be reached via the  <dig> intervening residues between these domains  as each ca-ca distance of adjacent residues is ~ <dig> Å. regarding the other inter-domain connections, the distance between the anti-parallel cc c-termini is  <dig> Å whereas the distance between the n-termini of the gc dimer is only  <dig> Å . this indicates that each linker would need to stretch about / <dig> =  <dig> Å which is too large for having only  <dig> intervening residues between cc and gc . these calculations are of course dependent on that either the h-noxa or gc dimer does not change globally  during activation but both of those have either been speculated to possibly change  or observed to change . with the parallel cc arrangement, these inter-domain n- and c-termini distances are shorter and therefore more compatible . it should however be noted that the termini in proteins structures are often flexible thereby possibly changing these distance-based extrapolations. based on the above arguments indicating that the sgca1βb <dig> cc is likely parallel, we were able to expand the partial  composite model of the heterodimeric sgc by adding in the h-nox coordinates  <cit>  and positioning this domain such its c-termini and the n-termini of h-noxa are in close proximity and that h-nox can also interact with the gc domain ; this latter requirement satisfied the direct h-nox/gc interaction that has previously been observed  <cit> .

finally, the fact that the c-terminal half of the cc domain is more conserved across the different cyclases , and likely of different length as also noted earlier  <cit> , is also indicative of a parallel helix arrangement as the conserved regions will interact with each other which would not occur in an anti-parallel cc arrangement.

mapping of guanylyl cyclase cc mutations
the cc domain present in mgcs and sgcs has been the site of a number of genetic mutations and has also been targeted by mutagenesis to probe structure-function. our crystal structure of cc domain allows us to now map the sites of these mutations on the cc structure to possibly gain additional structure-function knowledge.

first, the cc domain of sgca <dig> of the medeka fish oryzias latipes has been targeted for mutagenesis for structure-function studies  <cit> . the a <dig> mutations  l434k  and l445k  each caused a slight decrease in dimerization and no decrease of no stimulation yet increased basal activity by ~3-fold. the a <dig> l463k  mutation caused loss of basal and no stimulated activity and slight decrease in dimerization. combining these mutations in a triple mutant decreased the dimerization to ~30% of wt; adding l452k  mutant to form a quadruple mutant dropped the dimerization to only 10% of wt. secondly, the retinal guanylyl cyclase gc-e can harbor several blindness causing mutations in the cc domain . in addition, either of the gc-e double mutants l824s/y827s and l831s/l834s affected receptor function  <cit> . thirdly, the gc-a receptor also has one mutation  that is located within the cc and found to cause loss of activity but not loss of dimerization  <cit> . note that this latter mutation is equivalent to the o. latipes sgca <dig> l463k  mutant  suggesting that this residue is of considerable importance in both mgcs and sgcs. this residue is equivalent to sgcβ <dig> l <dig> which is making a  <dig> Å van der waals interaction with l <dig>  the above mentioned function-affecting cc mutations are listed in the sequence alignment  and their equivalent residues in sgcβ <dig> are mapped onto their structure . the mutations are roughly evenly distributed along the full length of the cc aa helix as there appears to be no clear concentration of mutations. furthermore, not all mutations correspond to residues at the a-d positions, indicating a critical functional role for cc regions within and outside the dimerization interface.

discussion
we have determined the structure of the cc domain of sgcβ <dig> which revealed a long aa helix, a short turn, followed by a short ab helix. the oligomeric state at first inspection seems to reveal a tetrameric anti-parallel arrangement yet our detailed analysis suggests that the dimer-of-dimers tetrameric arrangement is non-physiological and likely due to the hydrophobic end regions of the cc normally preferring to interact with other sgc protein regions that are missing in our crystallized construct. these hydrophobic cc end regions ended up therefore packing against another cc dimer to form this non-physiological tetramer. within the cc dimer structure, we argue that the observed anti-parallel nature of the cc arrangement in the sgcβ1β <dig> homodimer is likely different from that in full length heterodimeric sgc since its sgca <dig> cc partner is missing. in addition to having analyzed the possibilities of salt-bridge formation, residue preference at a-d positions, and inter-domain constraints regarding parallel vs anti-parallel cc formation for the s-helix, additional analysis also suggests a parallel arrangement as will be discussed next.

the s-helix is found in other non-guanylyl cyclase domain containing proteins and its proximity to other domains could also yield insights into the orientation arrangement since the distance of the termini is very different for the two different orientations. for example, the s-helix is also found in front of a diguanylate cyclase domain . anantharaman et al. had therefore previously suggested that the s-helix could perhaps merge/extend from the termini of these hamp and dnp domains  <cit>  which would only be possible in a parallel cc arrangement. in summary, the cc/s-helix region found in cyclases and other proteins is very likely in a parallel arrangement yet the observed anti-parallel cc in the sgcβ1β <dig> is likely physiological relevant as will be discussed next.

the sgcβ <dig> homodimer cc structure revealed an anti-parallel arrangement of the monomers and might shed some light into how sgc has evolved to favor heterodimerization over homodimerization . sgc has evolved this characteristic despite that many of the individual subunits are known to homo-dimerize by themselves. the dimerization kd's for the catalytic domain a1a <dig> and β1β <dig> homodimers are 10- <dig> μm and ~ <dig> μm, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, sgcβ <dig> h-noxa domain homo-dimerization kd is less than  <dig> μm  <cit>  and the β <dig> cc dimerization is likely also in the μm range. therefore, having at least three domains each with about a ~10-5m homodimerization kd constant within one protein would normally yield, due to avidity, an overall homodimerization binding constant in the nm if not pm range. such an extrapolated strong affinity would normally render the homodimers quite stable and it is therefore surprising that sgc homodimers are found to be unstable  <cit> . a possible unifying explanation could perhaps be the non-compatibility of the homo-dimeric cc orientation with respect to the position of the flanking domains: only a parallel cc would align its flanking domains correctly whereas an anti-parallel cc dimer, as observed in our sgcβ1β <dig> cc structure, might likely not . such a homo-dimer disfavoring mechanism could be important since only the sgc heterodimer is catalytically functional making it vital for the sgc subunits not to form stable yet unproductive homodimeric complexes. we realize that such a mechanism might be unique to sgc, being heterodimeric, as many other s-helix family members are homodimeric. perhaps a contributing factor to the uniqueness of part of sgc's homo-dimer disfavoring mechanism could be the possibility of unique 1-residue register slippage changes in the middle of the s-helix  <cit> .

conformational changes upon activation
ccs are known to be quite sensitive as small changes to ccs have been known to affect oligomerization and helix orientation . the cc region in guanylyl cyclases is likely also not a static coiled-coil dimer as it has been postulated to be important for regulation/signaling. this possibly regulatory role for the cc was observed in mutagenesis and modeling studies for gc-e indicating that this region was not optimized for dimerization but more for regulation as r <dig> mutations increased activity and might structurally extend/lengthen the cc region  <cit> . a bioinformatics study also suggested a regulatory/signaling role for the cc region and has termed this region in cyclases a signaling or s-helix  <cit> . both of these studies have indicated the s-helix to be parallel cc and modeled it as such. some possible cc conformational changes could involve a loop-to-helix transition, as observed in influenza virus hemagglutinin ha <dig>  <cit> , a shifting/flipping along the interface of the a-d knobs, as modeled for gcn <dig>  <cit> , or rotation of the helices as evidenced in the hamp structure  <cit> . in addition, a helix re-orientation from anti-parallel to parallel or vice versa can also not be ruled out.

despite the above emphasis of the cc in guanylyl cyclases possibly being a signaling module, it is likely that not all signaling of the upstream domains in mgcs and sgcs goes solely through the cc domain to reach the catalytic gc domain. this is evident from that the h-nox domain can directly interact and inhibit the gc domain in sgc  <cit> .

in addition to possible conformational changes involving just the long aa helix, activation conformational changes could also involve interactions of other sgc regions interacting with the end regions of the cc since there are a number of residues with conserved hydrophobicity . these end regions could perhaps interact with either cc's own ab helix, as in our structure since ab folds back on aa, and/or the small helix predicted to be between the h-noxa and cc domain . the cc aa helix could thus use the hydrophobic regions towards its ends that in our sgcβ <dig> structure form also part of the dimer of dimer interactions. it is noteworthy that the cc ends harbor two conserved residues that are found to be critical for mgc and sgc activation  suggesting an important role for this region in receptor activation and/or interactions with the other subdomains of sgc.

future structural studies are needed to determine the structure of sgc's heterodimeric cc alone and in the intact sgc and what the activation conformational changes are within this region.

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined the crystal structure of the sgcβ <dig> cc domain to  <dig>  Å resolution. this cc structure revealed a long a-helix, a turn near residue p <dig>  followed by a short second a-helix. cc domains are known for their oligomerization behavior and we therefore analyzed the inter-molecule interactions within the asymmetric unit which indicated a dimeric arrangement of the cc sgcβ <dig> subunits. additional sequence analysis and modeling of homo- and heterodimeric ccs allowed us to speculate that the hetero-dimerization preference over homo-dimerization of sgc subunits could be, in part, due to inter-helix salt-bridge formation. the cc region has been shown to be a critical region for guanylyl cyclase functioning and is the site for a number of congenital and man-made mutations in both membrane and soluble guanylyl cyclases. the cc sgcβ <dig> structure allowed mapping of those function-affecting mutations which pointed to an important role for some of the dimerization region but also for residues not involved in the dimer interface. this latter observation suggests that other cc surfaces are also important with perhaps having a role in interacting with the other flanking subdomains of sgc. our results also extend beyond guanylyl cyclases as the cc structure is, to our knowledge, the first s-helix structure and serves as a model for all s-helix containing family members.
