BACKGROUND
prader-willi and angelman syndrome  are complex neurobehavioral disorders associated with loss of function of a cluster of differentially expressed imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q <dig>  <cit> . pws is characterized by a neonatal stage of failure to thrive, hypotonia and respiratory distress followed by hyperphagia in early childhood with development of severe obesity, as well as short stature, hypogonadism, small hands and feet, mild to moderate mental retardation, and obsessive-compulsive behavior  <cit> . in contrast, as patients have a more pronounced neurological disease including developmental delay, severe mental retardation with lack of speech, hyperactivity, seizures, aggressive behavior and excessive inappropriate laughter  <cit> . most pws and as cases  are due to ~ <dig> mb de novo deletions spanning a  <dig> mb imprinted domain and several adjacent non-imprinted genes  <cit> . there are two classes of deletions in pws/as patients, one from breakpoint  <dig>  to bp <dig> and the other from bp <dig> to bp <dig>  <cit> . additionally, paternal or maternal uniparental disomy  explain 25% of pws and 5% of as cases, respectively, while 2–5% of pws and as cases result from imprinting defects . in each mechanism, pws arises from loss of ten paternally expressed loci, while as arises from loss of function of the maternally expressed ube3a gene  <cit> .

mouse models of pws with either matupd  <cit> , an id  <cit>  or a paternally-inherited chromosome deletion  <cit>  share a similar phenotype with failure to thrive, hypotonia and early postnatal lethality, modeling the first stage of the human syndrome  <cit> . similarly, mouse models of as have a patupd  <cit> , maternally-inherited chromosome deletion  <cit> , or a maternal mutation of ube3a  <cit> . in the transgenic  deletion mouse model, an epstein barr virus lmp2a transgene integrated with ~ <dig> copies into mouse chromosome 7b/c and created an ~ <dig> mb deletion of the mouse region homologous to the human pws/as genes   <cit> . as in human, the phenotype of the deletion mouse model depends on the parental origin: paternal or maternal inheritance of the tg-deletion, respectively, results in the tgpws mouse model characterized by severe neonatal hypoglycemia and early lethality  <cit>  or in tgas mice with a mild neurobehavioral phenotype and late onset obesity  <cit> .

previous imprinted gene expression studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization  showed that the tg insertion-deletion comprised all of the orthologs of pws and as imprinted genes and of several flanking non-imprinted genes . in addition, brain microarray and quantitative gene expression analyses confirmed the loss of expression of several imprinted genes  and 50% reduced expression of two non-imprinted loci  in tgpws mouse brain, and demonstrated that an unidentified non-imprinted locus within the deletion acted in trans to regulate a chromosome 18b <dig> gene expression domain  <cit> . to define the exact characteristics of the transgene insertion-deletion tgpws/tgas mouse model, we have now determined the extent of the deletion and the effect of the tg-insertion and deletion on expression of flanking genes. we delineated the deletion breakpoint positions between siglec-h and luzp <dig> at the centromeric end and within intron  <dig> of chrna <dig> at the telomeric end. most importantly, we describe tissue-specific positional effects of the tg insertion and/or deletion on luzp <dig> and chrna <dig> expression which are likely due to the presence or absence of specific enhancer elements.

RESULTS
fish refines the tgpws/tgas deletion extent and identifies a centromeric breakpoint
we used fish with bac probes flanking the mouse pws/as-homologous domain in chromosome 7b/c  to define the centromeric and telomeric extent of the tgpws/tgas deletion. to identify both chromosome  <dig> homologues in our fish experiments using splenocytes from tgas mice or fibroblasts from tgpws mice, we co-hybridized bac rp22-434n <dig> from the tyr gene locus at position  <dig>  mb , which is intact in tgpws and tgas mice   <cit> .

at the centromeric end of the deletion, bac rp24-354p <dig> spanning the siglec-h-d7mit70-tubgcp <dig> region  is deleted from one chromosome  <dig> in tgas mice . additionally, bacs rp23-256l <dig>  and rp23-195c <dig>  are within the tgpws/tgas deletion  as expected based on their map position. in contrast, bac rp24-426a <dig> from ~ <dig> kb 3' of luzp <dig>  shows a weak positive signal on one chromosome  <dig> homologue in tgas mice , suggesting a partial deletion and detection of the centromeric breakpoint in tgas mice.

at the telomeric end of the deletion, bac rp23-266f <dig>  spanning four mouse pws-region imprinted genes, including frat <dig>  mkrn <dig>  magel <dig> and ndn, was previously found to be deleted in tgpws mice  <cit> . extending telomeric from frat <dig> towards chrna <dig> , bacs rp23-100p <dig>  rp23-199n <dig> and rp23-140j <dig> were all deleted in tgpws mice . in contrast, bacs rp23-5o <dig> from the klf <dig> region  and rp24-215k <dig> from 5' cezanne <dig>  were intact in tgpws/tgas mice. two other bacs mapping more telomeric, rp23-76f <dig>  and rp23-441d <dig> , were also intact in tgpws mice . intriguingly, bac rp23-16a <dig> spanning chrna <dig>  appears based on hybridization signal intensity to be fully intact in tgpws mice . nevertheless, molecular data described below indicate that about half of 16a <dig> is deleted in tgpws/tgas mice; it is likely that these ostensibly contradictory data are explained by the relative concentration of unique and repetitive dna sequences at the telomeric and centromeric ends of bac 16a <dig>  as well as the difficulty in quantifying fish signals.

microarray and qrt-pcr analyses further define the tgpws/tgas deletion extent
previous analysis of brain global gene expression in  <dig> tgpws and  <dig> wildtype  mice at p <dig> using a mg-u74av <dig> gene chip array  which assayed  <dig>  genes and ests, demonstrated that all  <dig> paternally-expressed mouse pws-region imprinted genes present on the array  have dramatically reduced expression  <cit> . additionally, mrna levels for non-imprinted genes herc <dig> and cyfip <dig> were 50% in tgpws compared with wt  <cit> . to assess the extent of the tgpws/tgas deletion and the potential effect of the transgene-insertion deletion on expression of flanking genes, we used data mining from several genome databases and analysis of several megabases of genome sequence to identify all genes in these regions, determined which of these were on the mg-u74av <dig> gene chip, and then reanalyzed the brain microarray data from reference  <cit> . although a 3– <dig> mb "gene desert" lies just proximal of tubgcp <dig>  we identified  <dig> genes on the chip in the  <dig>  mb region centromeric of tubgcp <dig>  a locus which fish data above had shown was deleted, of which four genes were not detectable in either tgpws or wt brain at p <dig> . five genes  were detectable and showed no change in tgpws compared to wt mouse brain , indicating that the tgpws/tgas deletion does not affect any of these genes . telomeric of frat <dig>  an imprinted gene deleted in tgpws mice  <cit> , nine  of the fourteen genes extending out a further  <dig>  mb and on the microarray were detectable and all had comparable levels in tgpws and wt mice . therefore, the tg insertion-induced deletion does not affect gene expression over large regions outside the boundaries of the rearrangement.

a the primary microarray data from this experiment were reported in reference  <dig>  as summarized in fig. 1a, reference  <dig> included the data for the imprinted genes within the tgpws/tgas deletion that are on the mg-u74av <dig> chip  and for non-imprinted genes within the deletion . additionally, a cluster of chromosome 18b <dig> genes were found to be abnormally expressed in tgpws mice  <cit> . b mrna levels are presented as the medians of signal , for tgpws  and wt , with the number of calls as "detected" out of  <dig> comparison experiments in parentheses.

we next assessed quantitative  expression of genes that map in the proximity of the known deleted loci at the centromeric  <cit>  and telomeric  <cit>  ends of the deletion . at the centromeric end of the deletion, the siglec-h gene maps just proximal of tubgcp <dig> and is predicted to have five exons , with the rare feature of having the stop codon in the penultimate exon  <dig>  <cit> . since there is no information regarding the pattern of expression for siglec-h  <cit> , we first assessed this using rt-pcr . in agreement with the general signaling function of siglec genes in the haemopoietic, immune and nervous systems  <cit> , siglec-h was predominantly expressed in brain and spleen . less robust expression was seen in lung and skeletal muscle, while there was little or no amplification in heart, liver, kidney and testis . a postnatal role for siglec-h expression was suggested by the lack of amplification at early embryonic stages with increased expression after birth , as also found for ests in unigene .

by qrt-pcr, siglec-h showed 2-fold decreased mrna levels in the brain of both tgpws and tgas mouse models at p <dig> and p <dig> , indicating that this gene appears to be within the tgpws/tgas deletion . it may also be noted that the  <dig> -fold expression level in tgpws and tgas mice compared with wt indicates that siglec-h is not an imprinted gene. the next gene centromeric of this, luzp <dig>  showed ~ <dig> -fold decreased mrna levels in tgpws brain at p <dig> and p <dig> and in tgas brain at p <dig>  . at p <dig> in tgas, luzp <dig> brain mrna levels were decreased to  <dig> -fold vs. wt . combined, the presence of the tgpws/tgas deletion resulted in a luzp <dig> mrna level in neonatal brain that is significantly  less than in wt. we conclude that the luzp <dig> gene is intact at the centromeric end of the tgpws/tgas deletion but suggest a model in which a neuronal regulatory element is deleted that accounts for ~33% of luzp <dig> expression from the deleted allele .

at the telomeric end of the deletion, expression of cezanne <dig>  which maps just centromeric of klf <dig> , was unchanged by qrt-pcr in tgpws and tgas brain compared with wt mice , and thus this gene is intact in the tgpws/tgas deletion mouse model. the only remaining gene between cezanne <dig>  and frat <dig>  is chrna <dig> , suggesting that the deletion breakpoint might lie in the vicinity of this gene. chrna <dig> is orientated with a telomeric 5' end . using qrt-pcr for chrna <dig> and primers spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  we found ~ <dig> -fold decreased chrna <dig> mrna levels in both tgpws and tgas brain at p <dig> and p <dig>  . since the 5' end of chrna <dig> is not deleted in the tgpws/tgas mouse model , the finding of ~60% total mrna levels suggests that only ~20% of the usual level of chrna <dig> mrna transcripts are generated from the deleted chromosome in tgpws and tgas mouse brain. the 80% reduction in expression in cis suggests that the deletion removes essential regulatory sequences .

fine-mapping of the centromeric tgpws/tgas deletion breakpoint
the gene expression data described above suggest that siglec-h is deleted in tgpws and tgas mice while luzp <dig> is intact but shows slightly yet significantly reduced expression levels. in order to further delineate the centromeric breakpoint of the deletion and a potential mechanism for the ~33% reduction in luzp <dig> expression from the deletion allele, we examined the genome sequence of bac rp24-426a <dig> that lies between siglec-h and luzp <dig>  and that was identified above by fish as partially deleted in tgpws/tgas mice. there are no exons for any gene encoded in this bac. nevertheless, using blast of repeatmasked rp24-426a <dig> dna sequence against the non-redundant genbank database, extending from the centromeric end of bac rp24-426a <dig> we identified five non-coding conserved sequences  at positions ~ <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kb, respectively . nccs1- <dig> are 250-bp, 68-bp, 188-bp, 104-bp, and 157-bp in length and show 82%, 91%, 81%, 82% and 83% identity with human, respectively. as in mouse, the five nccs elements in human are located adjacent to luzp <dig> and map in chromosome 11p <dig>  . all five nccs elements are likely to be involved in the regulation of luzp <dig>  while other flanking genes are unlikely to be regulated by or to relate to nccs1- <dig>  as the next most centromeric gene  maps  <dig>  mb from luzp <dig> while the genes more telomeric are either non-syntenic in human , mapping to human chromosome 15q, or represent a rodent-specific acquisition .

pcr primers were designed from four of the nccs elements and q-pcr of dna from tgpws and wt mice was used to examine the relative amount of each nccs with respect to intron  <dig> of gapdh, which is intact in all mice studied. as a deletion control, we similarly examined by q-pcr the snurf-snrpn promoter, which as expected showed a  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold relative level in tgpws vs. wt mice . whereas there was no difference between tgpws and wt mice for nccs <dig> and nccs <dig> , indicating that nccs <dig>  nccs <dig> and nccs <dig> are intact in tgpws mice, q-pcr for nccs <dig> and nccs <dig> identified  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold lower levels for tgpws vs. wt, respectively , indicating that these are deleted from one allele in tgpws mice. therefore, the centromeric breakpoint of the tgpws/tgas ~ <dig> mb deletion lies in the  <dig>  kb region between nccs <dig> and nccs <dig> 

up-regulation of chrna <dig> allows mapping the telomeric tgpws/tgas deletion breakpoint
in contrast to the results shown above for chrna <dig> expression in brain, regular rt-pcr for chrna <dig> in newborn liver showed a dramatic increased expression in tgpws and tgas compared with wt . indeed, quantification of liver chrna <dig> expression by qrt-pcr revealed ~15-fold increased mrna levels in tgpws mice  . a similar up-regulation of chrna <dig> expression was found by rt-pcr in spleen tissues of tgas mice . however, eμlmp2a control mice with b-cell lineage expression of lmp2a showed normal expression of chrna <dig> in newborn liver . combined, these data on two different lmp2a transgene models indicates that lmp2a expression in b cells does not upregulate chrna <dig> in trans, and suggests that the increased expression of chrna <dig> observed in liver and spleen from tgpws and tgas mice results from a cis effect of the transgene insertion. since b-cell transcription of the lmp2a transgene in these models is driven from an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene promoter and enhancer  <cit> , we hypothesized that the latter enhancer was also driving transcription of the heterologous, endogenous chrna <dig> promoter.

to test this hypothesis, we used an exon  <dig> forward primer for chrna <dig> and a reverse primer  from inside the tg  to perform rt-pcr on cdna from tgpws vs. wt brain, which detected a  <dig>  kb product specifically in tgpws samples . the  <dig>  kb band was cloned and sequenced, identifying it as a fusion transcript encoding chrna <dig> exons 2– <dig> fused to the sense strand of the lmp2a transgene . the latter result indicates that at least the telomeric copy of the tg array is orientated in a 5'-3' telomere to centromere fashion. furthermore, we can conclude that the 5' end of the chrna <dig> locus is intact and correctly splices through exon  <dig> but then splices into the lmp2a transgene. these data strongly suggest that the telomeric breakpoint of the tgpws/tgas ~ <dig> mb deletion is in the  <dig>  kb chrna <dig> intron  <dig> 

orientation of the lmp2a transgene array
to fully understand how the transgene array might affect flanking gene expression, it is necessary to define the integrity of the array and the orientation of each transgene copy and to flanking genes. to characterize the transgene array, we amplified genomic dna from tgpws mice and wt controls using primers from within the transgene . amplification with either single primer  did not lead to any product , indicating that there are no head-to-head or tail-to-tail copies of adjacent transgene inserts. in contrast, pcr using primers from adjacent copies of the transgene results in amplification of the lmp2a array in tgpws dna . these data indicate that the ~ <dig> copies of the transgene  <cit>  are all in the same tail-to-head orientation. combined with the data described above on the sense strand fusion of chrna <dig> and lmp2a cdna sequences, we conclude that the entire tg array is orientated in a 5'-3' manner from the telomeric to centromeric end.

discussion
a mouse model of pws/as class i deletions
the tgpws and tgas mouse models were created by insertion of an lmp2a transgene array of ~ <dig> copies  <cit>  that fortuitously generated a deletion equivalent to those that occur in pws and as in the human. although the mouse deletion was previously estimated as being ~ <dig> mb in length, genome sequence analysis indicates that the deleted segment could be as large as  <dig>  mb . however, there are a few gaps in the sequence, particularly in several duplicated genomic regions throughout the imprinted domain, and so the exact size of this interval remains unknown. nevertheless, our previous  <cit>  and present studies allow the conclusion that  <dig> imprinted and  <dig> non-imprinted genes are included within the mouse pws/as-deletion region . in addition to spanning all the pws- and as-homologous paternally and maternally expressed genes, respectively, the tgpws/tgas deletion in mice also includes the homologs of typically deleted non-imprinted genes  as well as those of the pws/as genes  that define the deletion as equivalent to human class i deletions  <cit> . although the classic pws or as clinical phenotype is similar in both class i and class ii deletions, respectively, a more severe neurobehavioral phenotype has been described for class i compared with class ii deletion patients as well as for deletion vs. upd patients in each syndrome  <cit> . the tgpws and tgas deletion mouse models may therefore prove useful to compare the neurobehavioral phenotype to the upd or id pws  <cit>  or ube3a gene mutation as  <cit>  mouse models.

although the tgpws/tgas mouse models show reduced expression of several other genes, including siglec-h, luzp <dig> and chrna <dig>  as compared to the human pws and as class i deletions, none of these additional genes are likely to contribute to the tgpws and tgas phenotypes. for example, since siglec-h is a recent evolutionary addition in the rodent genome  <cit> , its 50% reduction in expression levels due to hemizygosity at the centromeric end of the deletion is unlikely to have a phenotypic effect. likewise, the ~17% reduction in overall expression of luzp <dig> observed in brain of tgpws/tgas mice is unlikely to be functionally important, since complete loss of luzp <dig> does not lead to any specific phenotype  <cit> . although chrna <dig> is another gene partially deleted in tgpws/tgas mice and the human ortholog maps in 15q <dig>  the latter is outside the pws/as deletions and the tgpws/tgas phenotype is unlikely to be affected by chrna <dig> hemizygosity, since chrna <dig> heterozygous knockout mice show no abnormal phenotypes and even chrna7-/- null mice have only mild skin and reproductive phenotypes  <cit> .

implications for evolutionary acquisition of new genes and breakpoint mechanisms
our study also characterized expression of a recently identified gene, siglec-h, which belongs to the siglec gene family encoding immunoglobulin-like lectins that act as extracellular receptors for sialic acid residues of glycan chains  <cit> . the majority of siglec genes map in a single cd <dig> -related cluster in human 19q <dig> and the syntenic mouse chromosome 7b <dig> region  <cit> . in contrast, we show here that siglec-h, which is rodent-specific and has no primate ortholog  <cit> , lies adjacent to the mouse pws/as-homologous region at a position  <dig>  mb from its ancestral location. it seems likely that siglec-h has similar postnatal immunological functions as other siglecs, given its robust expression in spleen. however, in contrast with the restricted expression of most other siglec genes to the haematopoietic and immune systems, siglec-h is also transcribed at high levels in postnatal brain. although conjectural, it is tempting to speculate that neuronal expression of siglec-h may have arisen due to an evolutionary positioning adjacent to single   <cit>  or clustered   <cit>  genes expressed at high levels in the nervous system, such that siglec-h transcription may be under control of a neuronal enhancer for one or more of these genes.

intriguingly, both the centromeric and telomeric tgpws/tgas deletion breakpoints map at or close to the positions of chromosomal evolutionary breakpoints, and at each of the latter two positions there are also rodent-specific gene duplication-insertions. at the centromeric end, the tgpws/tgas deletion breakpoint lies immediately adjacent to siglec-h, which as discussed above arose in rodents by a genomic duplication from a precursor gene located ~ <dig> mb away. the evolutionary insertion of siglec-h between tubgcp <dig> and luzp <dig> occurs right at the boundary of synteny with human chromosome 15q <dig> -q <dig> and 11p <dig> -p <dig> , respectively . moreover, the tubgcp <dig> ortholog also lies within a few kilobases of a primate evolutionary breakpoint that translocated the tubgcp <dig> – cyfip1-nipa2-nipa1-herc2-duplicon cluster to 15q <dig>  from an ancestral 15q <dig> location  <cit> . although the telomeric tgpws/tgas deletion breakpoint within chrna <dig> is not right at an evolutionary breakpoint, this gene also lies adjacent to an evolutionary breakpoint separating genes whose human orthologs map to the pws imprinted domain in 15q <dig>  and a point  <dig>  mb away in 15q <dig>  . at this position also, there are species-specific duplications in mouse and human, with the retrotransposed frat <dig> limited to rodents  <cit>  or the herc2- and flanking duplicons in primates  <cit> . other authors have also noted the apparent congruity of chromosome rearrangement and evolutionary breakpoints  <cit> , suggesting that currently unknown chromosomal structural features in these regions may play recombinogenic roles.

effect of the transgene or deletion on gene expression: mapping of putative neuronal enhancers
transgene insertions may be accompanied by other chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions , duplications  <cit> , inversions  <cit> , translocations  <cit> , or combinations of rearrangements  <cit> . these events can induce alterations of gene expression over large chromosomal regions  <cit> , or the transgene itself can do so  <cit> . extensive analysis of genes flanking the tgpws/tgas transgene insertion demonstrated no other rearrangements other than the pws/as-region deletion and that gene expression over large regions outside the immediate flanking genes was not affected. in contrast, expression from the first gene promoter outside either end of the transgene insertion-deletion was affected. for example, the 5' promoter and 3' end of luzp <dig> are ~ <dig> kb and 110– <dig> kb centromeric to the lmp2a transgene array-deletion breakpoint, respectively, and this gene shows a significantly reduced expression in tgpws and tgas mice. although at present we cannot fully exclude three models that might lower the luzp <dig> transcriptional level in cis in brain, which invoke either  a non-specific disruption of chromatin,  a weak silencing effect from the transgene tandem array  <cit> , or  extended antisense transcripts from the transgene array given that the 5'-3' orientation of the lmp2a array is opposite to the luzp <dig> direction of transcription, we feel that these are less likely than a fourth model that has additional experimental support. we propose that the 33% reduction in expression of luzp <dig> from the deletion allele is most likely explained by deletion of a neuronal enhancer . consistent with this model, we identified two nccs elements  conserved in all eutherian mammals sequenced to date and deleted in tgpws and tgas mice, that represent strong candidates to be the neuronal enhancer. as noted above, these elements map to the homologous chromosome location in human but are almost  <dig> mb from the next most centromeric gene  while other flanking genes in mouse are non-syntenic  or not present  in human . numerous nccss occur within mammalian genomes  <cit> , and while the majority of these have no known function, many do act as enhancer elements  <cit> . future in vitro and in vivo studies  <cit>  will be able to examine this enhancer model for luzp <dig> 

at the telomeric end of the deletion, expression of chrna <dig> was dramatically upregulated in liver and spleen, but not brain, due to a tissue-specific positional effect of the transgene. we propose that the transgene immunogobulin mu enhancer acts in b cells to promote transcription in cis from the heterologous chrna <dig> promoter . similarly, transgene regulatory elements  <dig> mb away have been shown to activate sox <dig>  <cit> . moreover, our data combined with cloning of a 5'-chrna7-lmp2a fusion transcript clearly demonstrates that the chrna <dig> promoter is intact and fully capable of high levels of enhancer driven activity on the deletion allele in tgpws/tgas mice.

perhaps the most intriguing finding of this study was our serendipitous discovery that a putative neuronal enhancer for the chrna <dig> gene maps within the telomeric end of the tgpws and tgas deletion. in tgpws and tgas mice, the chrna <dig> mrna level in brain from the deletion chromosome  <dig> falls to 20% of normal levels despite the fact that the 5' promoter is not deleted. non-enhancer models appear unlikely to explain this data: for example, models invoking  non-specific disruption of chromatin or  a silencing effect from the transgene tandem array  <cit>  are unlikely to account for the specific ~80% reduction in cis expression levels in tgpws and tgas mouse brain, while allowing a dramatic activation of the same promoter in immune tissues, and, finally  chrna <dig> is transcribed from upstream and in the same orientation as the transgene array, so that an antisense mechanism is not valid. therefore, we propose that sequences that map 3' of the deletion breakpoint in chrna <dig> intron  <dig> are critical for chrna <dig> expression in neurons , and it is the deletion of this putative neuronal enhancer that accounts for the reduced chrna <dig> expression in brain of tgpws and tgas mice . similar analyses of chrna <dig> gene expression in other tissues of tgpws and tgas mice, such as the neuromuscular junction, heart, and skin, will allow further assessment of the tissue specificity of the proposed enhancer. interestingly, our data in brain and other tissues also imply that the chrna <dig> promoter in vivo only has basal transcriptional activity whereas for high levels of transcription, chrna <dig> requires activation by a tissue-specific enhancer. in support of this model, we recently identified as candidate enhancer elements two nccss within chrna <dig> intron  <dig>  whereas no other conserved non-coding sequences other than the minimal promoter occur in a  <dig> kb domain starting  <dig> kb 5' of chrna <dig> and extending 3' of the gene towards the mouse pws-region imprinted domain . we are currently mapping the chrna <dig> nccs elements against the tgpws/tgas deletion endpoints, while in vitro and in vivo approaches will be needed for analysis of function as candidate neuronal transcriptional enhancers and/or for other cell types.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used a variety of molecular cytological and genetic technologies to map the transgene insertion-chromosome deletion breakpoints of a mouse model of pws and as to ~ <dig> kb regions between the luzp <dig> and siglec-h genes at the centromeric end and within chrna <dig> intron  <dig> at the telomeric end, respectively. gene expression analyses then allowed us to demonstrate that genes extending out a further  <dig> - or  <dig> -mb centromeric or telomeric of the deletion, respectively, are not affected by either the deletion or insertion of the transgene tandem array. in contrast, transcription of genes at  or flanking  the transgene insertion-deletion breakpoints are affected by the disruption of normal chromosome architecture, with positional effects leading to up- or down-regulation dependent on the tissue-specificity and locations of enhancers within the transgene or putatively removed by the tgpws/tgas chromosome deletion. using luzp <dig> as an example, we demonstrate that analysis of phylogenetically conserved sequences and consideration of synteny allows the fine mapping of a putative neuronal enhancer element, while a similar model likely also applies for chrna <dig>  in human, chrna <dig> is of significant interest as a schizophrenia candidate gene with both genetic and functional support  <cit> . nevertheless, the molecular basis of its candidacy remains uncertain since rare coding and in vitro characterized promoter variants in chrna <dig>  <cit>  may be insufficient to account for deficient function in vivo  <cit> , particularly in light of our observations that expression of chrna <dig> in vivo requires a major participation of enhancer function. identification of a neuronal enhancer and further studies in the human to examine for genetic variation and potential mutations might provide an explanation for a role of chrna <dig> as a schizophrenia-susceptibility gene.
