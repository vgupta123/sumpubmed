BACKGROUND
wheat is a temperate crop best adapted to cool growing conditions. however, in the australian wheat belt and may other parts of the world, temperatures increase during the wheat growing cycle, exposing the crop to damaging heat waves  during the sensitive reproductive development stages   <cit> . in addition to reducing yield, these events decrease the average grain size and increase the proportion of very small grains , downgrading the value of the harvested grain at delivery. average annual wheat yield losses due to heat stress in australia and the usa have been estimated at 10–15 %  <cit> . furthermore, the problem is expected to worsen with climate change. for example, it is estimated that within 35 years, over half of the indo-gangetic plains  - currently producing 15 % of the world’s wheat in one of the most populous regions - will become re-classified as a heat-stressed growing environment  <cit> .

heat stress that occurs at around meiosis can cause floret sterility, with the sensitivity to this effect peaking about  <dig> d before anthesis  <cit> . floret sterility leads to a reduction in grain number. heat stress that occurs early in grain filling can reduce grain size  <cit> . these narrow windows of susceptibility for specific yield components, coupled with the sporadic and unpredictable nature of natural heat events and their frequent co-occurrence with drought stress, hampers efforts to breed for heat tolerance by direct selection. greater scientific knowledge about traits associated with heat tolerance, and molecular markers for loci that affect those traits, could be useful for devising more effective selection methods.

a range of physiological and biochemical processes limit wheat yields under high temperature conditions and any of these could potentially represent the basis for genotypic variation in heat tolerance . heat stress accelerates the loss of leaf chlorophyll, reducing photosynthetic capacity and supply of assimilate to the filling grains. hence, the ability of some genotypes to maintain green area longer under stress  is considered an advantage  <cit> . another source of assimilate is water soluble carbohydrate mobilized from the stems to the filling grains, particularly under stress conditions that limit current photosynthesis  <cit> . vulnerability of the starch biosynthetic capacity of the grain itself may also be a critical factor, notably in relation to heat sensitivity of soluble starch synthase in the developing grain  <cit>  and accelerated maturation of the grain by heat, triggered by stress signals such as ethylene  <cit> . elevated temperatures increase evaporative demand, potentially causing moisture stress. open stomata enabled by a favourable plant water status are also necessary for photosynthesis and also allow evaporative cooling of the plant tissues through transpiration. lower canopy temperature has been found to correlate with yield performance in various heat/drought stressed environments  <cit> .

mapping of heat tolerance quantitative trait loci  is a pre-requisite for producing molecular markers suitable for heat tolerance breeding. qtl co-localization can also be a powerful way of identifying traits associated with heat-tolerance of yield components. these associated traits can give clues about underlying tolerance mechanisms and potentially provide complementary selection criteria for heat tolerance breeding. a number of researchers have mapped qtl for heat tolerance in wheat based on relative performance in late- versus timely-sown field experiments . however the relevance of these qtl to heat shock events experienced in the normal production environment is uncertain due to the various other ways that late sowing alters plant performance  <cit> . while the growing environment in greenhouse/growth-chamber experiments also differs in several important ways to the field  <cit> , at least such experiments allow a controlled and precisely timed heat treatment to be applied to one set of plants that otherwise experience the same growing conditions as their controls. controlled environment screens therefore provide a practical approach for identifying heat tolerance qtl that can be subsequently tested for reproducibility in the field, e.g., by evaluating weather parameter x genotype interactions in multi-site and -location trials of near-isogenic lines.

there have only been a few studies to map qtl for heat tolerance of yield components and associated traits in wheat. mason and colleagues detected tolerance qtl for yield components and architectural traits in one mapping population  <cit> , and for yield components and organ temperature in another  <cit> . two other studies focussed only on kernel weight  <cit>  or traits relating to chlorophyll content dynamics  <cit> .

in the current study we sought to expand the knowledge of heat tolerance qtl for yield components in wheat and their associations with heat-response and per se parameters relating to chlorophyll content and plant architecture, by applying greenhouse/chamber heat tolerance assays to a new doubled haploid mapping population made from a cross between the australian varieties drysdale and waagan. the heat treatment was applied at  <dig> d after anthesis  to produce effects on final grain size.

RESULTS
comparison of experiments, trait and parents
temperatures in the greenhouse where plants were grown before and after heat treatments are shown in an additional file 1: table s <dig>  temperature was constant and similar, except that in experiment  <dig> there were 9 days over 30 °c at around anthesis and 13 days over 30 °c at around grain filling due to high outside temperatures. in the greenhouse, which was naturally lit, plants in experiment  <dig> began growing under short days and matured under long days, whereas the converse occurred in experiment  <dig> 

means and standard error  of all traits in the two parents and doubled haploids  across the two treatments and experiments are shown in an additional file 2: table s <dig>  on average, plants in experiment  <dig> took ~20 % longer to reach anthesis , and were larger . however, they took less time to senesce completely in the spike and flag leaf after anthesis . despite this shorter post-anthesis green period and the greater number of hot days in the ‘control’ greenhouse in this experiment, the grains were ~20–40 % larger than in experiment  <dig>  time course plots of flag leaf chlorophyll  illustrate that during the period of measurement , control plants underwent senescence in experiment  <dig> but not in experiment  <dig> fig.  <dig> time-courses of chlorophyll content  during and 2-weeks after the  <dig> d heat treatment. the red bar represents the period of heat treatment. the triangles for experiment  <dig> indicate >30 °c days in the greenhouse. error bars show sem. * and *** indicate significant difference between control and heat-treated plants at p <  <dig> , and p <  <dig> , respectively



table  <dig> shows the % heat response  of each trait in the two experiments, in the parents and dh mapping lines. as expected, the heat treatment did not significantly affect gns, dta or chlorophyll content at 10 days after anthesis , as these were traits that were established prior to heat treatment. significant heat effects included reduced grain size , reduced the time to reach complete senescence of the spike and flag leaf  and accelerated flag leaf chlorophyll loss . grain weight responses  tended to be greater in experiment  <dig> than experiment  <dig> both in percentage and absolute terms, while chlorophyll and senescence traits responded to heat similarly across experiments. in some cases, there was a significant reduction in shw associated with the heat treatment.table  <dig> trait responses. responses are percent differences in heat treated plants relative to control plants, for the two parents and the means of the doubled haploids

traits are partitioned in the table based on their relationships to duration of development phases, yield components and biomass, chlorophyll content and stability, flag leaf dimensions and harvest index, respectively



relative to drysdale, waagan took longer to reach anthesis , but took less time to senesce completely in spikes and flag leaves after anthesis , had more grains spike− <dig>  but smaller grains , had shorter ph and had shorter flag leaves  . in drysdale , flag leaf chlorophyll was reduced by heat during the 3 day treatment  but thereafter the plants recovered to resume chlorophyll loss rates similar to those of controls . by contrast, the tolerant parent waagan showed no significant effect of heat on chlorophyll loss measured up to  <dig> daa  or on the time taken for flag leaves to completely senesce  . significant heat responses of grain weight  were observed in waagan and drysdale, but only in experiment  <dig>  and the responses were similar between the varieties  .

trait heritabilities
trait heritabilities  in the dh lines are shown in an additional file 3: table s <dig>  these were large for plant height, shoot weight and yield components, owing to segregation of the rht-b <dig> and rht-d <dig> semi-dwarfing genes. heritability of grain size  was high under control conditions  and did not increase under heat. by contrast, heritability of chlorophyll and senescence related traits increased markedly under heat, which at least partially reflected the presence of segregating genes influencing heat-induced senescence .

trait correlations
heat responses were defined using the heat susceptibility index  of fischer and maurer  <cit>  , which describes the performance of the genotype under control conditions relative to heat, normalized for the stress intensity of the experiment. correlations between trait potentials  and trait hsis are represented in an additional file 4: table s <dig> 

in experiment  <dig>  which was sown in early autumn, earlier flowering genotypes tended to have greater grain weight stability under heat  whereas in experiment  <dig> sown in mid-winter, there were no significant correlations with flowering time.

larger plant size  tended to be positively correlated with stability of chlorophyll traits   and grain size traits  in experiment  <dig>  whereas the trend was the opposite in experiment  <dig> 

in both experiments, genotypes with more chlorophyll per se, slower senescence and a longer period of post-anthesis flag leaf greenness under control conditions also tended to maintain chlorophyll, grain weight and shoot weight better under heat , particularly in experiment  <dig>  exceptions to this trend were the traits describing the duration of post-anthesis greenness in the spikes and flag leaves  in experiment  <dig>  for which there were positive correlations between control values and hsis .

overall, these correlations indicate that earlier flowering, greater greenness  and heat stability of shoot weight were associated with the ability to maintain grain weight under heat.

segregation of dwarfing and flowering time genes
the qtl analysis and diagnostic markers showed that the only major phenology loci segregating in the drysdale × waagan doubled haploid population were rht-b <dig> and rht-d <dig> for plant height . drysdale carried the wild-type  allele at rht-b <dig> and dwarfing allele at rht-d <dig>  and vice versa for waagan. the strongest qtl for days to anthesis  had an additive effect of only  <dig>  d , and the population was uniform for diagnostic marker-polymorphisms at vrn-a <dig> , vrn-b <dig> , vrn-d <dig>  and ppd-d <dig> . in the rht <dig> region on chromosome 2d, there were no qtl for height. consistent with non-segregation for rht <dig>  all dh gave a gwm <dig> microsatellite marker fragment of the same size .

the three minor flowering time qtl were on linkage groups 2b <dig>  4b, and 7b. the population segregated for the  ppd-b <dig> marker at the 74 cm location on linkage group 2b <dig>  but the minor flowering time effect  mapped at position 5 cm. hence this was not a ppd-b <dig> effect.

the molecular marker map
the linkage map made from the drysdale × waagan dh population is represented in additional files, using the total mapped marker set  or non-redundant marker set . its features are summarized in an additional file . it consisted of  <dig> genetically non-redundant marker loci spanning a total of  <dig>  cm, at an average marker spacing of  <dig>  cm .

heat tolerance qtl
there was a total of  <dig> qtl regions defined  . of these, ten showed significant hsi qtl  effects. only two of these  showed hsi effects for grain weight  and these are summarized in table  <dig>  for simplicity, only the two sgw hsi effects were given formal qtl names for future reference .table  <dig> qtl effects locating to qtl <dig> and qtl <dig>  the only loci in the drysdale × waagan population that showed heat-tolerance effects for single grain weight

qtl <dig> on chromosome 3b
the strongest qtl for hsi of grain weight   was located distally on the tip of the short arm of chromosome 3b. its attributes are shown in table  <dig>  it was detected in both experiments and accounted for  <dig> to 22 % of the variance, with the waagan allele conferring grain weight stability . on average, the waagan allele reduced heat induced losses of sgw by  <dig>  mg and  <dig>  mg over the drysdale allele in experiments  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, where the average reduction due to the heat treatment in the dhs was  <dig>  mg and  <dig>  mg, respectively. the strongest hsi qtl for each of the chlorophyll related traits  were also observed at this qtl position  . for these hsi effects, the waagan allele also favoured greater chlorophyll stability, in terms of absolute content after heat treatment , senescence rate  and the time taken for the flag leaf to senesce completely after anthesis . in other words, the effect of this locus on heat tolerance for grain size was associated with stay-green. in experiment  <dig>  the waagan allele at the locus stabilized shoot weight  and grain filling duration  under heat . these effects on shw and gfd were further indications of the ability of the waagan qtl <dig> allele to slow senescence in plants exposed to post-anthesis heat.

as shown by the data in table  <dig>  the hsi qtl effects at qtl <dig> were mainly/solely derived from genetic effects expressed under heat conditions rather than control conditions, i.e., this locus gave significant qtl effects under heat conditions but not under control conditions, for traits related to grain size , and senescence rate  and for shoot weight . for flag leaf chlorophyll content, both before the heat treatment period  and after , the waagan allele of qtl <dig> also conferred higher values per se in control plants, although this effect increased under heat. under control conditions, the waagan allele also favoured lower hi, although no qtl effects were detected at this locus for the components of hi .

qtl <dig> on chromosome 6b
the only other locus to show a tolerance effect for grain weight was qtl <dig> on chromosome 6b . the tolerance allele from drysdale was associated with a reduced rate of heat-induced chlorophyll loss during the heat treatment , as well as a less negative chlr <dig> and greater ausc per se under heat. these effects were weaker and less consistent than those detected at qtl <dig>  explaining only  <dig>  to 12 % of the variation for these traits, and were detected only in the winter-sown experiment . on average, the drysdale allele reduced heat-induced sgw loss by  <dig>  mg over the waagan allele .

hsi loci for traits besides grain weight
six other loci showed hsi effects and these effects related to senescence traits . the loci were on chromosomes 1a , 4a , 4b , 5a  and 7b . hsi effects on gfd and flse at qtl <dig>  qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> were comparable in magnitude to those controlled by the major tolerance locus on 3b , while the other effects at these loci were weaker than that of qtl <dig> .

the chlr <dig> tolerance  allele at qtl <dig> was associated with lower chlorophyll content pre-heat , which was the opposite relationship to the one observed at qtl <dig>  however it did confer less negative chlr <dig>  under control conditions, consistent with the other observations linking slower senesce under control to stay-green under heat.

a variety of trait behaviors were observed at the remaining hsi loci. qtl <dig> and qtl <dig>  which were the two strongest flowering time loci segregating in the population , had rapid flowering alleles associated with heat tolerance of flse . however, under control conditions, the rapid flowering allele was associated with higher gfd and flse at qtl <dig> but lower gfd and flse at qtl <dig>  qtl <dig> was one of four minor height loci detected . the tall allele was associated with heat sensitive gfd. the gfd tolerance allele at qtl <dig> was associated with longer gfd and greater sgw in control plants. sensitivity to heat induced chlorophyll loss at qtl <dig> was associated with shorter gfd in control plants.

other loci affecting grain weight under heat stress
three qtl relating to grain weight  were detected under only heat conditions but didn’t translate to significant grain weight hsi effects. these were located on chromosomes 1b , 4a  and 6b . the large-grain alleles at qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> were also associated with greater shoot weight under heat, and the latter also with greater grain number per spike under heat.

five other loci showed sgw effects under both heat and control conditions but no hsi effect for sgw. these were on chromosomes 2d , 4b , 4d , 5b  and 6a .

relationship of qtl <dig> to previously documented qtl in wheat
markers most commonly associated with peaks of qtl effects at the qtl <dig> locus  delimited an 18 mb region on the wheat chromosome 3b reference sequence, representing ~ <dig>  % of total physical length of the 774 mb chromosome. other previously reported qtl on 3bs were able to be located in this vicinity, based on sequence matches of closely linked markers to this part of the 3b reference sequence .fig.  <dig> previously described qtl in the vicinity of the qtl <dig> heat tolerance locus. qtl positions were compared based on positions of markers from the current study  and previous studies  in the reference wheat chromosome 3b sequence. numbers to the left of the magnified chromosome segment indicate mb distance from the top of the chromosome. qtl are marked by peak  marker positions . other published qtl effects were: grain yield and plant height in stressed and other environments in a durum wheat ril population   <cit> ; heat tolerance index for grain number spike− <dig> for a brief heat stress applied at 10 days after anthesis in a growth chamber, and flag leaf length before heat treatment, in a spring × winter wheat cross   <cit> ; stay-green visually scored under high temperature field conditions in a bread wheat ril population   <cit> ; maximum grain filling rate, grain filling duration, thousand grain weight, and flowering time under field conditions in a winter bread wheat ril population   <cit> ; chlorophyll content under drought/heat or irrigated conditions in mexico in a spring bread wheat dh population   <cit> 



there were some differences as well as similarities between the effects of qtl <dig> and the other previously reported qtl. as for qtl <dig>  the qtl of bennett et al.  <cit>  and kumar et al.  <cit>  affected the content and stability of leaf chlorophyll while the qtl of wang et al.  <cit>  influenced single grain weight and grain growth. the qtl of maccaferri et al.  <cit>  influenced yield in the field. differences in the phenotype of qtl <dig> relative to the other qtl include a plant height effect at the durum locus, a flowering time effect at the wang et al.  <cit>  locus, a flag leaf length effect at the locus of mason et al.  <cit> , and the lack of a significant grain size effect under heat/drought stress conditions at the loci of bennett et al.  <cit>  and mason et al.  <cit> . these comparisons suggest that variation for qtl <dig> may be present in other germplasm and express a yield and/or grain size effect under field conditions.

discussion
this greenhouse-chamber study identified two qtl influencing response of final grain size to a brief severe heat stress treatment applied at early grain filling, with a locus on 3bs being the strongest and most reproducible. single grain weight  and its response to heat represents the integration of many processes. therefore, we measured a range of physiological and developmental traits to gain insights into factors driving heat responsiveness to grain weight and the basis of the tolerance mechanisms controlled by the qtl.

relationships of sgw heat tolerance effects to photosynthetic capacity - flag leaf chlorophyll and flag leaf dimensions
the heat treatment reduced chlorophyll in the flag leaves, mainly during the  <dig> d heat treatment period . consistent with the idea that this chlorophyll loss affected grain weight, the major qtl conditioning grain weight maintenance under heat  also showed the strongest qtl effects for chlorophyll response parameters, with the waagan allele for stable sgw contributing to retention of flag leaf chlorophyll under heat. qtl <dig> accounted for 54 % of the phenotypic variation for chlc27daa . on average, dh lines carrying the drysdale allele lost  <dig>  more spad units by  <dig> daa than those carrying the waagan allele , compared to an average of  <dig>  spad units lost across all dhs.

generally, qtl <dig> also had the greatest effect on chlorophyll content per se traits in control plants. four other loci also affected chlorophyll content per se . these four loci also influenced tolerance to heat-induced chlorophyll loss, with the high chlorophyll per se alleles favouring chlorophyll stability. however, none of these loci produced significant sgw hsi effects. the weaker sgw tolerance locus qtl <dig> also showed no effect on chlorophyll per se in control plants. qtl <dig> was, however, the only locus other than qtl <dig> to show a significant qtl effect for the rate of decline in chlorophyll during the heat treatment period  in the heat treated plants and for chlr <dig> heat responsiveness . therefore, among the chlorophyll traits, chlr <dig>  was the most consistent indicator of sgw heat tolerance qtl.

why high chlorophyll content per se under control conditions should be related to chlorophyll heat-resilience is unclear, but might involve a more active state of chlorophyll synthesis capable of buffering against heat induced chlorophyll losses. one possibility is that low-chlorophyll per se genetic effects derived from an earlier onset of leaf senescence , and therefore ‘priming’ for more rapid heat-induced chlorophyll losses. unfortunately, the presence of multiple hot  days during grain filling in the control greenhouse in experiment  <dig> prevented us from estimating the senescence status of the plants in that experiment prior to heat treatment . 

the coupling of grain weight and flag leaf chlorophyll responses at qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> could imply that heat-induced chlorophyll loss in susceptible genotypes reduced photosynthate supply to a point that it became limiting to grain filling. photosynthesis in flag leaves  provides a major source of assimilates for grain filling in wheat  <cit> . under optimum growth conditions, grain filling is most commonly limited by sink strength, while a shift towards source limitation tends to occur under stress conditions such as drought which reduces green leaf area and/or photosynthetic efficiency  <cit> . plants in experiment  <dig> which were sown ’off season’ set and filled grain during the low light conditions of winter; however, they suffered less from heat-induced grain weight loss than those in experiment  <dig> , probably owing partly to the fact they had fewer grains per spike . hence, it is uncertain if the ~5 % chlorophyll loss caused by the heat treatment was sufficient to cause source limitation in either experiment. alternatively, curtailing of starch synthetic capacity in the grain through senescence responses within the grain itself may have been responsible for the grain weight losses. i.e., acceleration of senescence in the grains and flag leaves by heat may have been synchronized via common genetic control, rather than arising by a direct cause-effect relationship.

another factor that could potentially influence photosynthetic capacity was flag leaf dimensions . however, qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> loci for heat tolerance of sgw had no detectable effect on these variables. fw and fl qtl effects were detected at other genomic locations, although these were minor  . hence, we found no evidence that flag leaf dimensions  impacted sgw heat tolerance, similar to the findings of mason et al.  <cit> .

relationships of sgw heat tolerance effects to the duration of grain filling and flag-leaf senescence
short heat events during grain filling reduce final grain weight in wheat mainly by affecting grain filling duration rather than grain filling rate  <cit> . in the present study, the time between anthesis and 95 % senescence of the spikes on the main tiller was used as a measure of grain filling duration . like gfd, the flag leaf senescence trait   relates to how long the top of the primary tillers remained green after anthesis, and these two traits were positively and closely correlated . spike photosynthesis can contribute a high proportion of the grain yield , and this fraction tends to increase further under stress conditions such as drought  <cit> . hence the gfd trait also had potential to relate to photoassimilate supply to the filling grains.

the main heat tolerance locus for grain weight  expressed significant gfd and flse hsi effects, with the waagan allele conferring heat stability of all three traits. however, the minor grain weight heat tolerance locus  showed no significant gfd or flse hsi effects. hsi effects were observed for gfd at qtl <dig>  qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> and for flse at qtl <dig> and qtl <dig>  these hsi effects for gfd and flse were similar in magnitude to those of the sgw heat-tolerance locus qtl <dig> but these loci did not themselves significantly influence hsi of sgw.

qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> differed from qtl <dig> in that they also influenced time from sowing to anthesis . in both cases the late flowering allele made gfd and flse more responsive to heat and also resulted in shorter gfd and flse per se in control plants. such a negative correlation between the duration of pre- and post- anthesis development has been reported before in both wheat and barley  <cit> , suggesting there is a general physiological link between time to flowering and the duration of post anthesis development in cereals. dwarfing alleles at rht-b <dig> and rht-d <dig> loci lengthened gfd and flse per se in control conditions, but they gave no significant hsi effects for gfd or flse.

in summary, truncation of grain filling and/or responsiveness of green period duration in flag leaves or spikes were not consistent or strong features of sgw heat tolerance loci. however, this is based on the assumption that visual scoring of spike senescence provided an accurate proxy for gfd.

relationships of sgw heat tolerance effects to shoot mass
qtl <dig> was the only locus to show a significant effect on hsi of shoot dry weight at maturity , with the waagan allele conditioning heat stability of sgw and shw . a plausible scenario is that the accelerated heat-induced chlorophyll loss associated with the drysdale allele reduced the carbon fixing capacity of the plant, which in turn constrained both the ability to maintain/add dry matter in the shoots and possibly also the grain. two other loci  significantly affected both sgw and shw only under heat , providing further evidence that heat stability of shw and sgw was physiologically linked.

conversely, the data did not support a hypothesis in which mobilization of water soluble carbohydrate  reserves from the stems contributed to grain weight stability under heat. this is because such a tolerance mechanism would be associated with a greater rather than smaller loss of shw dry mass under heat. tall alleles of the rht-b <dig> and rht-d <dig> loci increase absolute quantities of stem reserve  due to their effects on stem length. the fact that these loci had no measurable effect on grain weight maintenance under heat also argues against a contribution of stem wsc to grain weight stability in these conditions.

implications for breeding
this study detected several qtl with potential for use in marker assisted breeding. however, to determine whether they are worthy of use, the yield and/or grain size benefits of these qtl need to be verified in heat affected field trials . qtl <dig> showed the most promise, as it had the largest sgw-stabilizing effect under heat stress and this was expressed both in the mid-winter and early-autumn sown experiments. previously described qtl in the vicinity  suggest that qtl <dig> may vary within other germplasm and express yield and grain weight effects in the field. the other sgw heat tolerance locus  had weaker effects and was detected in only one experiment  and hence seems less promising.

together with loss of shoot weight during heat, the rate of chlorophyll loss in flag leaves during the brief heat treatment  was the most diagnostic feature of sgw heat tolerance loci, and hence this trait showed promise as an indicator for sgw tolerance that might be useful in heat tolerance screening. plants could be heat treated at early grain filling using either a growth chamber or by utilizing natural heat waves in the field. its measurement would require no non-stressed controls and just two spad measurements - one directly before the heat treatment  and one directly after.

three qtl had grain size effects detectable only under heat  and these could be selected to provide an advantage under heat stressed environments. another three loci  affected grain size under both control and heat conditions and could therefore be selected to provide a grain weigh advantage under all conditions.

variety heterogeneity and linkage map construction
while varieties are required to be ‘distinct, uniform and stable’ for plant variety protection, a level of heterogeneity is tolerated, including at the marker level. consequently, many released varieties  are heterogeneous for some genomic regions   <cit> .

as described in methods, heterogeneity in the parent varieties of the drysdale × waagan dh mapping population resulted in blocks of markers that segregated in some but not all ‘sub-populations’ . in total, there were  <dig> such blocks, spanning a total of 368 cm, or 15 % of the total genetic length of the genome. prior to linkage map construction, we converted the marker scores in these blocks to ‘missing data’ to avoid mapping errors caused by spurious associations among markers.

blocks affected by parent heterogeneity were defined as those that were non-segregating in  <dig> to  <dig> of  <dig> sub-populations. we expect that this approach was not fool proof, since some such blocks may have been missed  or incorrectly defined . these blocks could have been precisely identified if the parental plants used in crossing had been genotyped. despite the absence of this information, there was good alignment of our map to a consensus map of the  <dig>  snp array  <cit> , indicating that our map was largely accurate. hence, our data processing approach allowed us to avoid most of the potential mapping errors due to parent variety heterogeneity. fortunately, use of a high-density marker array and the availability of a reliable consensus map in this case allowed this approach to be applied.

CONCLUSIONS
two qtl were detected which influenced the response of grain weight to a brief heat stress applied at early grain filling in a growth chamber, qtl <dig>  and qtl <dig> , with the former having the strongest and most reproducible effect. among the other measured traits, heat-induced losses in final shoot dry weight and increases in the rate of flag leaf chlorophyll loss during the heat treatment were the best predictors of loci affecting grain weight response, with alleles limiting grain weight loss also restricting loss of shoot dry mass and chlorophyll. rate of chlorophyll loss during the heat treatment was identified as a trait warranting investigation as a potentially rapid genotype-screening tool to predict grain weight responses to heat shock events experienced in the field or imposed using chambers. further work is required to establish whether the associations of chlorophyll, shoot weight and grain weight originate from source limitation to grain filling, or merely common genetic control of senescence in the leaves and grains. with validation, markers for qtl <dig> and qtl <dig> might prove useful in marker-assisted breeding of heat-tolerant wheat cultivars.
