BACKGROUND
tgif  is a homeodomain containing protein which was first identified by its ability to bind adjacent to a specific retinoic acid response element  <cit> . tgif is a transcriptional repressor, which interacts with general corepressors, including ctbp and the msin3a/histone deacetylase  complex  <cit> . loss of function mutations in human tgif are associated with holoprosencephaly , a severe genetic disease affecting craniofacial development  <cit> . a human tgif related protein  has been identified, which shares at least some functions with tgif  <cit> . tgif and tgif <dig> are also transcriptional corepressors for tgfβ receptor activated smads  <cit> . tgif interacts specifically with smad <dig> and smad <dig>  and is thought to limit the magnitude of the transcriptional response to tgfβ signaling. in response to the binding of tgfβ to its cognate receptors, the activated receptor complex phosphorylates and activates specific receptor smad  proteins: smad <dig> or smad <dig> in the case of tgfβ and activin  <cit> . the activated r-smads then complex with the co-smad, smad <dig> and accumulate in the nucleus, where they activate expression of specific target genes. the smad proteins themselves can bind to dna, and are also recruited to specific response elements via interactions with other sequence specific dna binding proteins  <cit> . once bound to a specific target dna element, a smad complex activates transcription via interactions with general coactivators, such as p300/cbp  <cit> . in addition to coactivator interactions, smads can also interact with specific transcriptional corepressors, including tgif and tgif <dig>  <cit> , c-ski and the related snon  <cit> . these interactions result in a loss of activation due to displacement of the coactivator complex, and active repression of gene expression by the recruitment of general corepressors  <cit> . it is likely that the relative abundance of smad coactivators and corepressors within a cell is a major determinant of the magnitude of the transcriptional response to tgfβ.

since human tgif and tgif <dig> appear to be relatively divergent in primary amino acid sequence outside the two main blocks of homology  <cit> , we wanted to identify and characterize tgif <dig> from another species. here we report the cloning and characterization of mouse tgif <dig>  as well as the identification of an unusual splice variant of the mouse tgif <dig> gene. analysis of this splice variant suggests that the tgif <dig> genes from both human and mouse contain a retained intron, which is spliced out of a proportion of mouse tgif <dig> rnas.

RESULTS
two splice forms of mouse tgif2
we isolated clones for mouse tgif <dig> by pcr from  <dig> day mouse embryo cdna using primers at the extreme 5' and 3' ends of the coding sequence. a band of the expected size for tgif <dig> was amplified from this cdna, and a faster migrating band was also present . each of these dna fragments was cloned and sequenced: the slower migrating form represented a mouse tgif <dig> clone encoding a predicted  <dig> amino acid protein with only  <dig> amino acid differences from the human protein . interestingly, the faster migrating dna fragment also contained a form of mouse tgif <dig>  but was lacking  <dig> base pairs from the centre of the cdna. inspection of the sequences that are missing in this clone revealed the presence of 5' and 3' splice sites as well as a 5/ <dig> match to the branch point consensus sequence  <cit> , suggesting that this deletion is caused by alternate splicing . the branch point sequence is less well conserved  in the human tgif <dig> gene, and we have been unable to amplify a similar form of human tgif <dig> from cdna . thus, it appears that this alternately spliced form of tgif <dig>  is not found to a significant degree in humans.

to determine how wide-spread the expression of the two splice forms of mtgif <dig> is, we pcr amplified mtgif <dig> cdnas from a panel of mouse tissues. in all adult tissues where mtgif <dig> was detected, both forms of the mrna were present, and both splice forms were present from day  <dig> of embryonic development . in all tissues tested, the mtgif2d splice form was readily detectable by this rt-pcr assay. however, we have not carried out accurate quantification of the relative amounts of each splice form in multiple tissues.

both splice forms of mouse tgif2d produce proteins
the predicted proteins from the human and mouse tgif <dig> genes are highly conserved, with 94% identity over the entire protein . for comparison, tgifs from these species are 89% identical. there are two regions of conservation between tgif and tgif2: the homeodomain plus a  <dig> amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension which is characteristic of tgifs , and a region near the carboxyl-termini of the proteins . as shown in figure 2a, alternate splicing of mtgif <dig> removes part of the central linker joining the two regions of conservation between tgif and tgif <dig> proteins. we previously characterized two tgif related proteins from drosophila, that have a high degree of identity to vertebrate tgifs in the homeodomain and the carboxyl-terminal extension  <cit> , which is conserved in vertebrate tgifs . interestingly, alternate splicing of mtgif <dig> retains the homeodomain and almost all of the conserved region carboxyl terminal to it, suggesting that the homeodomain plus carboxyl-terminal extension  is not disrupted in mtgif2d.

to test whether the alternate splice form of mtgif <dig> is expressed as a stable protein product, we transfected cos- <dig> cells with flag-tagged versions of human and mouse tgif <dig> and mtgif2d. the human tgif <dig> protein migrates as two, or three bands  of apparent molecular weight of 30– <dig> kd . this results from phosphorylation of two conserved map kinase sites within the carboxyl terminal region of the protein  <cit> . in cells expressing mtgif <dig>  three bands in the 30– <dig> kd range were present, as well as a group of three bands with faster mobility . the difference in mobility between these two triplets is consistent with the removal of approximately  <dig> kd predicted by removal of  <dig> codons from the centre of the coding sequence. expression of the mtgif2d isoform resulted in the presence only of the lower group of bands. alteration of the two threonine residues within the conserved map kinase sites to valines within mtgif <dig>  resulted in the presence of only two bands, suggesting that as with the human tgif <dig>  <cit>  the upper bands are due to phosphorylation of these residues . thus, it appears that multiple forms of mouse tgif <dig> are created both by alternate splicing and phosphorylation.

mouse tgif2d encodes a functional repressor which interacts with msin3
to determine whether the mtgif2d protein functions in a similar manner to the longer splice form, we first looked at interactions with the general corepressor, msin <dig>  tgif interacts with the corepressor msin <dig> via its carboxyl terminal repression domain, which is conserved in human and mouse tgif <dig>  <cit> . however, interaction of msin <dig> with tgif <dig> from mouse or human has not been demonstrated. cos- <dig> cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding flag-tagged human or mouse tgif <dig>  or flag-mtgif2d and myc epitope-tagged msin <dig>  protein complexes were isolated on flag agarose and analyzed for the presence of myc-sin <dig>  both human and mouse tgif <dig> interacted with msin <dig>  as did the mtgif2d splice variant, whereas, no interaction was seen with a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant of htgif . to test whether mtgif2d can repress transcription, we expressed either mtgif <dig> or mtgif2d in hepg <dig> cells and monitored expression of a luciferase reporter gene in which expression is driven by the tk promoter and two copies of a tgif binding site . as shown in figure 3b, both the full length mtgif <dig> and mtgif2d repressed expression of this reporter, suggesting that both splice forms are transcriptional repressors.

both tgif and human tgif <dig> interact with tgfβ responsive smads and repress transcription from tgfβ responsive reporters  <cit> . to determine whether alternate splicing of mouse tgif <dig> affected interaction with tgfβ activated smads, cos- <dig> cells were cotransfected with smad <dig> or smad <dig> expression plasmids together with human or mouse tgif <dig>  smad <dig> clearly coprecipitated with both full length human and mouse tgif <dig> and with the mtgif2d splice variant . similarly, smad <dig> interacted with both forms of mouse tgif <dig>  however, we observed no interaction of smad <dig> with a truncation mutant encoding amino acids 2– <dig> of htgif <dig> . together, these results suggest that sequences carboxyl-terminal to the homeodomain of tgif <dig> are required for interaction with smad <dig>  and that the central region of the tgif <dig> protein is dispensable for interaction with tgfβ activated smads. to test whether the interaction of mtgif2d with smad <dig> and smad <dig> resulted in repression of tgfβ transcriptional responses, we cotransfected hepg <dig> cells with the 3tp-lux reporter and expression vectors encoding either human tgif or tgif <dig>  or mouse tgif2d. as shown in figure 3d, all three proteins repressed the expression of this reporter in the presence of added tgfβ, although tgif appeared to repress more effectively. these results suggest that both full length and the shorter isoform of mouse tgif <dig> can act as smad transcriptional corepressors.

a retained intron in the second coding exon of tgif2
to compare expression of human and mouse tgif <dig> mrnas in transfected cells, we generated expression vectors containing only the  <dig> amino acid orfs from either species. as shown in figure 4a , rt-pcr analysis of rna from cos- <dig> cells transiently transfected with a mtgif <dig> expression construct revealed the presence of both mtgif <dig> splice forms. in contrast, similar analysis of cos- <dig> cells transfected with the human tgif <dig> orf revealed only a single band corresponding to the full length  <dig> codon orf . for comparison, we also performed pcr reactions directly on plasmids containing the long and short forms of mtgif <dig> and obtained a single band of the expected size for each . this suggests that alternate splicing of tgif <dig> is specific to the mouse gene and independent of cell type. additionally, it appears that the splicing event is dependent on the nucleotide sequence of the mtgif <dig> coding region. these data suggest that the mouse tgif <dig> transcript can undergo multiple splicing events: removal of the first and second introns from all rnas, and removal of part of the second coding exon from a proportion of mtgif <dig> rnas . thus the second coding exon of mtgif <dig> appears to contain a small intron, which is retained in at least half the mrnas. in contrast, in the human mrna, this intron is always retained, or removed at an extremely low frequency, below our level of detection.

analysis of the sequences required for alternate splicing
the previous data suggest that the mtgif <dig> coding region contains sequence information which directs alternate splicing, and this information is not present in the human. to determine which region of the mtgif <dig> rna is required for alternate splicing, we first made a series of swaps between human and mouse tgif <dig>  the coding region was divided into three segments: the retained intron and the regions 5' and 3' to it. cos- <dig> cells were transfected with expression vectors containing these chimeric cdnas and mrnas were analyzed by rt-pcr. as shown in figure 5a, both the retained intron and the region 3' of it from the mouse gene were required for alternate splicing . in contrast, constructs with either the 3' region alone , or both the retained intron and the 5' region  from the mouse did not splice out the retained intron. to determine whether sequences within the 3' region were inhibitory in the human gene or promoted splicing in the mouse gene, we tested two deletion constructs each for the human and mouse cdnas. neither of the human deletion constructs underwent alternate splicing, and the mouse 1– <dig> construct produced only a single splice form . the intermediate deletion  resulted in a very low level of the alternate splice form, suggesting that the 3' coding region of the mouse gene contains sequences which enhance splicing. analysis of a larger series of mtgif <dig> 3' deletion constructs revealed that sequences 3' of base  <dig> were not required for alternate splicing , whereas further truncation to base  <dig> dramatically reduced alternate splicing.

mouse and human tgif <dig> share a high degree of sequence identity in the 3' region of the coding sequence . we were, therefore, interested to determine whether we could transfer small regions of the mouse coding sequence to the human tgif <dig> clone and cause it to undergo alternate splicing. we first altered the sequence surrounding the branch point in the retained intron from a 3/ <dig> match to a 5/ <dig> match to the consensus, as in the mouse sequence. as shown in figure 6a, this change alone did not cause the human sequence to undergo alternate splicing . when this alteration was combined with the mouse 3' region an intermediate level of splicing was observed . thus, it appears that the branch point sequence plays a role in determining the differential splicing between human and mouse tgif <dig>  however, we cannot rule out contributions of other sequence differences within the retained intron.

to determine whether there was a simple sequence signal in the region of the mouse rna 3' of the retained intron, we created two constructs in which mouse sequences 3' of base  <dig> were combined with the mouse retained intron  or the mouse 5' region . within the chimeric 3' region, bases 410– <dig> come from the human and 544– <dig> from the mouse. this leaves only  <dig> base differences between the mouse sequence and the hmh construct over the retained intron and 3' region combined. when transfected into cos- <dig> cells, neither of these constructs underwent alternate splicing to any detectable level . this suggests that if there is a splicing enhancer sequence in the 3' of the mouse coding sequence it is either relatively large or composed of multiple elements throughout the region. together, these results suggest that the mouse tgif <dig> coding sequence contains multiple positively acting signals which increase the efficiency of alternate splicing to remove a retained intron. to further explore the species specificity of the alternate splicing of tgif <dig>  we performed rt-pcr analyses on cell lines from different mammalian species, and searched available sequence databases. interestingly, tgif2d splice forms are present in the database from both mouse and rat, but not for any other vertebrate species for which tgif <dig> clones are present. consistent with the results from database searching, we have been unable to amplify by rt-pcr, or pcr from cdna libraries a human or dog tgif2d splice variant. thus, it appears that the tgif2d splice variant may be specific to rodents.

discussion
we show that the mouse tgif <dig> gene undergoes alternative splicing, whereas, the human tgif <dig> gene appears not to generate the alternate splice form at any significant level. interestingly the alternate splicing seen in the mouse tgif <dig> gene is dependent on the coding sequence of the mouse tgif <dig> mrna. alternate splicing of the isolated mouse coding sequence occurs in all cell lines tested, and we did not detect significant levels of splicing of equivalent human tgif <dig> constructs. importantly, the pattern of splicing of the isolated human and mouse coding regions appears to correlate with that of the endogenous genes. alternate splicing of the mouse rna results in the removal of a region of the second coding exon, without disrupting the reading frame. at least half the time, this region is retained in the mouse rna and appears to be always retained in the human. thus it is possible that the human tgif <dig> gene contains a constitutively retained intron. searching the sequence databases for tgif <dig> genes from other species revealed full length coding sequences from rat, cow and dog. as shown in figure 5b, 5' and 3' splice sites did not differ in four of the five species, and only one difference was present in the cow sequence. however, the branch acceptor site in the mouse sequence was closer to the consensus than any of the other species and human and dog were most different, with 3/ <dig> mismatches. pairwise comparison of the sequences 3' to the retained intron between these five species revealed a high degree of identity , which is very similar to that for the entire coding sequence . however, the mouse and rat sequences share 95% identity, whereas all other sequences are less than 90% identical.

alternate splicing is likely to be the result of competition for spliceosome assembly between multiple splice sites, whereas, for intron retention it may be that the competition is between spliceosome assembly and rna export  <cit> . in the human tgif <dig> rna, spliceosome assembly is too inefficient at these sites, whereas in the mouse rna it occurs with a high enough efficiency that the retained intron is removed from a significant proportion of rnas. although this type of alternate splicing is relatively uncommon in animal cells, compared to the variable use of alternate splice sites  <cit> , database analysis suggests that up to 14% of human genes have intron retention events. however, unlike the case reported here, the majority of these were found to be in untranslated regions  <cit> .

we were unable to define a small region within the mouse tgif <dig> coding sequence which promoted splicing, but it appears that the splicing event is dependent on much of the second coding exon. in many cases, alternate or regulated splicing is dependent on the presence of splicing enhancers, which can be located within exons. splicing enhancer consensus sequences have been identified, and shown to bind to sr proteins such as sf2/asf, srp <dig> and srp <dig>  <cit> . binding of sr proteins to splicing enhancers is thought to facilitate the recruitment of the splicing machinery to adjacent introns, which can be several hundred bases distant. although some matches to splicing enhancer sequences are present in the mouse tgif <dig> coding sequence, we were unable to identify one which was responsible for the difference between human and mouse splicing. comparison of the human and mouse tgif <dig> sequences in the region 3' to the retained intron did not reveal the presence of a splicing enhancer consensus that was present in the mouse but disrupted by sequence differences in the human. analysis of the coding sequences of human and mouse tgif <dig> reveals the presence of a large number of predicted exonic splicing enhancer  consensus sequences . we were unable to identify clear candidate ese sequences which were present only in the mouse and not in the human, or which had much higher scores in the mouse than the human sequence. this may fit with our results which suggest that multiple regions of the mouse coding sequence promote alternate splicing.

CONCLUSIONS
the tgif <dig> gene contains a retained intron within the second coding exon. in the mouse, this retained intron is removed by splicing in a significant proportion of mrnas, whereas, we have been unable to detect this splice form of the human tgif <dig>  it appears that the mouse tgif <dig> coding region 3' of the retained intron contains sequences which promote removal of the retained intron in a cell type independent manner. in addition, sequences within the retained intron also contribute to the efficiency of splicing.
