BACKGROUND
escherichia coli that produces one or more types of cytotoxins known as shiga toxin  or verocytotoxin  is referred to as shiga toxin-producing e. coli  or verocytoxion-producing e. coli   <cit> . stec is a well-known pathogen as a cause of diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis  and hemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . most cases of hc and hus have been attributed to stec o157:h <dig>  but the importance of non-o <dig> stec is increasingly recognized  <cit> .

stec possesses a number of virulence factors. besides the stx genes, human pathogenic stec strains often carry the eae gene, one of the genes located on lee pathogenicity island encoding the adherence factor intimin  <cit>  and the asta gene encoding a heat-stable enterotoxin east <dig>  <cit> . stec strains may also be hemolytic due to the presence of the α-hemolysin or the enterohemolysin or both. the α-hemolysin gene hlya is located on the chromosome  <cit>  while the enterohemolysin  is harbored by a plasmid  <cit> . many adherence-related factors were found in stec  <cit> . ehec factor for adherence  was shown to be essential for the adherence of the bacteria to cultured epithelial cells  <cit> . the irga homologue adhesin  is a stec adherence-conferring molecule conferring the adherence phenotype upon a nonadherent laboratory e. coli strain  <cit> . lpfao <dig>  lpfao157/oi- <dig> and lpfao157/oi- <dig> are adhesion genes in lee-negative stec strains  <cit> . many stec strains contain the heterologous 60-mda virulence plasmid, which encodes a potential adhesin toxb  <cit> . other novel adhesion factors reported include autoagglutinating adhesin   <cit>  and porcine attaching and effacing  associated protein   <cit> . most stec strains isolated from diarrheal pigs can produce one or more of the fimbriae, f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  different types of fimbriae were reported to be associated with stec diarrhea in animals of different age groups  <cit> . the yersinia high-pathogenicity island  carrying fyua  and irp  is also present in certain non-o <dig> stec lineages and was previously reported only in stx2e carrying human isolates  <cit> .

domestic ruminants, especially cattle, are the major reservoirs of stec. other animals like sheep, goats have been confirmed as important natural reservoirs in some countries  <cit> . swine also play an important role as a carrier of this pathogen. stec strains that produce stx2e can cause edema disease in pigs  <cit>  and can also been isolated from human stools at low frequency. stec carried by healthy pigs may pose a potential risk to humans  <cit> . relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of stec in pigs in china. in this study, we isolated and characterized stec from different pig slaughter houses and pig farms from  <dig> geographical regions, beijing city, chongqing city and guizhou province in china.

RESULTS
prevalence of stec in swine samples
out of  <dig> swine samples collected in this study,  <dig> %  were stx-positive by pcr. a total of  <dig> stec isolates was obtained from  <dig> samples, giving a culture positive rate of  <dig> %  of all stx-positive samples. different stx-positive rates in small intestine contents , colon contents  and feces  samples were observed. the colon contents samples gave the highest stx-positive rate  and also the highest culture positive rate   .

only a single isolate was recovered from  <dig> stx-positive samples each. but  <dig> isolates per sample were recovered from  <dig> samples,  <dig> isolates per sample from  <dig> samples,  <dig> isolates per sample from  <dig> samples and  <dig> isolates per sample from  <dig> sample.

serogroups and serotypes
the  <dig> stec isolates were typed into  <dig> serotypes, comprising  <dig> o serogroups and  <dig> h types. forty-four isolates were o antigen untypable and  <dig> isolates were non motile which were designated as . nineteen serotypes were found including o2:h32/, o9:h30/, o20:h30/, o20:h <dig>  o76:h <dig>  o86:h <dig>  o87:h <dig>  o100:h20/, o114:, o116:h <dig>  o143:h38/, o159:h <dig>  o172:h30/, ont:h <dig>  ont:h <dig>  ont:h19/, ont:h21/, ont:h30/, ont:.

the predominant serotypes were o20:h30/, ont:h30/, o2:h32/, o100:h20/, o9:h30/, ont:h19/, o143:h38/, o172:h30/ which consisted of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  isolates respectively. five serotypes  contained  <dig> isolates each and  <dig> serotypes  contained only  <dig> isolate each .

bninety-two stec isolates were subtyped by primer-specific pcr except one isolate of o159:h <dig> 

sorbitol fermentation and hemolysis
out of the  <dig> stec isolates,  <dig>  were sorbitol-positive, covering all three types of samples and three regions. twelve serotypes including o2:h32/, o9:h30/, o20:h <dig>  o76:h <dig>  o86:h <dig>  o87:h <dig>  o114:, o116:h <dig>  ont:h <dig>  ont:h19/, ont:h21/, ont: were sorbitol-positive while  <dig> serotypes  were sorbitol negative. all except  <dig> ont:h30/ isolate was sorbitol-positive.

fourteen isolates displayed apparent β-hemolytic activity on sheep blood agar including  <dig> of the  <dig> o2:h32/ isolates and  <dig> of the  <dig> o86:h <dig> isolates, and the single o76:h <dig>  o87:h <dig> and o116:h <dig> isolates, the majority of which  were recovered from swine feces in chongqing city. the  <dig> hemolytic o86:h <dig> isolates were isolated from colon contents in a slaughter house in beijing city and the single o87:h <dig> isolate was isolated from a small intestine content in a slaughter house in guizhou province.

shiga toxin genes, adhesin genes and putative virulence genes
the  <dig> stec isolates were tested positive for stx <dig> only. all except  <dig> isolate was stx2e subtype by pcr subtyping. the exception was an o159:h <dig> isolate which was found to carry a new variant of stx2e by sequencing. the new variant differs from the closest stx2e  by  <dig> % at nucleotide level.

three virulence-related genes  and  <dig> markers for hpi  were screened.  <dig> %  stec isolates carried asta,  <dig> %  isolates contained hemolysin gene hlya and only  <dig> %  isolates contained enterohemolysin gene ehxa. all hlya positive stec isolates showed hemolytic activity on standard sheep blood agar. hemolysis was not observed in the  <dig> ehxa-positve stec isolates. the irp <dig> and fyua genes were identified in  <dig> stec isolates, all of which were ont:h19/ serotypes .

among the  <dig> adherence-associated genes,  <dig>  were not detected in the  <dig> stec isolates. paa was present in  <dig> stec isolates. two o86:h <dig> isolates,  <dig> o87:h <dig> isolate and  <dig> o116:h <dig> isolate carried f <dig>  eighty-two stec isolates did not carry any of the adherence-associated genes tested .

antibiotic resistance in the swine stec isolates
antimicrobial resistance was determined against  <dig> antibiotics. the highest prevalence was tetracycline resistance with a rate of  <dig> %. most isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, followed by resistance to kanamycin with a rate of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. resistance rate to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and piperacillin was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. lower resistance was observed for cephalothin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, gentamicin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin-sulbactam with a rate ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. all isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem .

four isolates  were susceptible to all  <dig> antimicrobial agents tested. thirteen isolates  were only resistant to  <dig> antimicrobial substance, while  <dig> isolates  exhibited resistance to  <dig> or more antimicrobials tested. the stec isolated from pig farms in chongqing city showed resistance to a larger number of antimicrobial agents, and at a significantly higher rate than those isolated from slaughter houses in beijing city  . an o116:h <dig> isolate exhibited multi-drug resistant phenotype against  <dig> of all  <dig> antimicrobial agents .

pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
all  <dig> stec isolates were analyzed by pfge but only  <dig> isolates produced clear bands to give a pfge profile which were divided into  <dig> pfge patterns . the most prevalent serotype o20:h30/ with  <dig> isolates were typed into  <dig> pfge patterns and the  <dig> o2:h32/ isolates were typed into  <dig> pfge patterns. an upgma dendrogram was constructed . the  <dig> stec isolates could be divided into six clusters, a to f, at a similarity of 75% or greater. cluster a contains all  <dig> o9:h30/ and all  <dig> o100:h20/ isolates. cluster b contained the majority of o20:h <dig> isolates which were grouped into  <dig> subclusters. all the  <dig> of o2:h32/ isolates also fell into cluster b as one subcluster. cluster c was heterogenous containing  <dig> serotypes. clusters d to f contained mostly one serotype: o143:h38/, ont:h19/, ont:h30/ respectively. although isolates were largely grouped together by serotypes, identical pfge profiles were also found among isolates of different serotypes  which were not from the same sample but from the same sampling point.

multi-locus sequence typing 
the  <dig> stec isolates were typed into  <dig> sequence types  with  <dig> novel sts . four new sts  were resulted from a novel allele in fumc , gyrb , icd  and reca  respectively. three new sts  were due to new combinations of previously known alleles. the predominant sts were st <dig> and st <dig> containing  <dig>  and  <dig>  isolates respectively. six sts contained  <dig> or more isolates with st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> comprising  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  isolates respectively. five sts  contained  <dig> isolates each. eight sts  had only  <dig> isolate each. stec isolates from beijing, chongqing and guizhou were typed into  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sts respectively. st <dig> were recovered from all  <dig> regions and st <dig> and st <dig> were recovered from  <dig> regions, while other sts was only found in one region.

a minimum spanning tree was constructed . most sts differed from each other by  <dig> or more alleles while three pairs of sts  and one set of  <dig> sts  differed from each other by only  <dig> allele. there is good concordance between sts and serotype. one st consisted of solely or predominantly one serotype. however st <dig>  the most frequent st, contained  <dig> serotypes, o20:h30/, o172:h30/ and o20:h <dig> with the first serotype being predominant. pfge and mlst were also largely consistent in the clustering of the isolates . st <dig> and st <dig> with  <dig> snp difference in icd allele were grouped together with st <dig> in pfge cluster a. all st <dig> isolates were grouped into  <dig> subclusters within pfge cluster b which were separated by st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> isolates were grouped together which differed by  <dig> snp difference in gyrb. pfge clusters d and f were inclusive of all st <dig> isolates and st <dig> isolates respectively. however, the  <dig> sts  within pfge cluster c and the  <dig> sts  within pfge cluster e were not closely related to each other by mlst . on the other hand, st <dig> was not grouped together with st <dig> by pfge, which differed by  <dig> snp difference in gyrb. the sole st <dig> isolate c <dig> also differed from the  <dig> st <dig> isolates by serotype, hemolysis and antibiotic resistance profile.

isolates of the same sts generally showed the same or similar drug resistance patterns . all st <dig> isolates showed the same multi-drug resistance to  <dig> antibiotics. similarly, isolates of st <dig>  st953and st <dig> showed respective identical resistance profiles. all st <dig> isolates were resistant to tetracycline. however there existed variations of drug resistance within an st. st <dig> showed the most variability with resistance to  <dig> to  <dig> drugs. st <dig> which was isolated from all  <dig> regions also showed varied resistance profiles.

discussion
different prevalence of stec in pigs were reported previously  <cit> . kaufmann et al.  <cit>  compared the stec shedding rate in pigs at slaughter, which varied widely and ranged from  <dig> % to 70% depending on the health conditions of the pigs and the detection method used. as shown in this study the anatomic sites sampled also affected the rate of isolation and consequently affected the prevalence in the population reported. fecal samples were commonly used  <cit> . in our study we sampled the small intestinal content, the colon content and the feces. the prevalence of stec in the colon  was almost  <dig>  times higher than in feces   and  <dig>  times higher than in the small intestine  . stec strains are thought to mostly colonize the colons of humans  <cit>  and it is likely to be the same for pigs.

in this study,  <dig> isolates were recovered from  <dig> of the  <dig> stx-positive samples, giving a culture positve rate of  <dig> %, this result is similar to that of botteldoorn et al. <cit> , in which stec isolates were obtained from 31% of the stx pcr-positive pig samples. failure to isolate stec from the stx-positive samples may due to the perturbation of high levels of background microflora, the loss of stx prophages during subculture, the presence of other bacteria carrying stx or low levels of stec in the samples.

in the present study,  <dig> serogroups and  <dig> serotypes were identified. the majority of these serotypes have been isolated from swine, sheep, cattle, food, and water in other countries  <cit> . the most prevalent serotype is o20:h30/, which was also reported in cattle and sheep in different countries  <cit> . six serotypes  were rarely found in stec isolates isolated from swine and other ruminants, implying that these serotypes may be restricted to the swine populations in these regions and their environments. serotypes o86:h <dig>  o20:nm, o100:nm, o9:nm, o172:nm and o114:nm have previously been described among stec isolated from human patients  <cit> . serotype o157:h <dig>  which is common serotype causing human disease in some countries, was not detected.

a possible reason for no isolation of o157:h <dig> might be the method used. isolation of o <dig> stec often requires more targeted methods, such as the use of o <dig> immunomagnetic beads to capture the bacteria from enrichment broth and then culture on selective media  <cit> . we previously used immunomagnatic separation to successfully isolate o <dig> stec from pigs, although that was in an outbreak setting and was in a different geographic region  <cit> . in this study we used chromagar™ ecc only and didn’t specifically target o <dig> stec. chromagar™ ecc has been used by others for isolation of stec from pigs  <cit> . however, that study did not isolate o <dig> stec either. therefore, the chromagar™ ecc may not be an ideal media for o <dig> stec isolation.

we used sorbitol-macconkey agar as a quick method to pick potential o <dig> colonies since sorbitol fermentation is a traditional feature for differentiating o157:h <dig> which is sorbitol-negative although there are sorbitol-positive o <dig> stec  <cit> . in this study, a fair proportion  of non-o <dig> stec is actually sorbitol-negative. therefore sorbitol fermentation is not a good indicator for o157:h <dig> 

we analyzed multiple colonies from  <dig> samples to determine diversity within a sample . two samples contained isolates with identical properties, suggesting they are the same strain, while the majority of the samples contain isolates belonging to the same sequence type but differing by one or more of the phenotypic or genetic properties tested, indicating that they are variants of the same clone. the most common variations are non-expression of the h antigen, variation of antibiotic resistance and/or variation in pfge patterns. however  <dig> samples contained  <dig> different sts. samples s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> all contain the prevalent st <dig> and an additional st, being st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> respectively, suggesting  <dig> different clones infecting the same pig.

many studies have underlined the potential key role of the stx <dig> subtypes in the severity of disease. although stx2e is not a potent subtype  <cit> , strains harboring stx2e have been isolated from patients with diarrhea  <cit> . intimin contributes to the development of a/e lesions and is a key virulence for some stec serotypes  <cit> , while ehxa can be found in many stec serotypes, such as o157:h <dig> and o26:h <dig> that are associated with diarrheal disease and hus  <cit> . however, sonntag et al. reported that the stx2e-positive e. coli isolated from healthy pigs rarely contains genes for intimin and enterohemolysin  <cit> . the prevalence of ehxa is very low in our samples at  <dig> %, consistent with the findings of sonntag et al.  <cit> .

other virulence factors may contribute to the pathogenicity of stec. although the role of east <dig> toxin in virulence to pigs has not been clearly determined, several studies have shown that asta gene is widely present among stec isolates from both diarrheal and healthy pigs  <cit> . asta gene was also the most prevalent virulent gene  among the  <dig> virulence genes tested in our study.

hpi was originally identified in yersinia and now found in a range of pathogens  <cit> , including the hus-associated e. coli husec <dig>  <cit>  and the  <dig> german hus outbreak strain o104:h <dig>  <cit> . hpi had previously been detected in stx2e- producing stec strains from humans only  <cit> . in this study we found  <dig> stx2e stec isolates, all ont:h19/, harbored the  <dig> hpi genes fyua and irp although the frequency is low at  <dig> %.

fimbrial adhesins play an important role in colonization of the pig intestine and stec strains may express up to  <dig> antigenically distinct fimbrial adhesins, f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  <cit> . different types of fimbriae can be associated with stec diarrhea in animals of different ages  <cit> . in this study, only  <dig> isolates contained a fimbrial adhesin . none of the other fimbrial adhesins  was detected. of the nonfimbrial adhesin-encoding genes, paa was found in  <dig> isolates , but efa <dig>  toxb, lpfao157/oi- <dig>  lpfao157/oi- <dig>  lpfao <dig> and saa were not detected in any of the  <dig> stec isolates. eighty-two stec isolates did not carry any of the adherence-associated genes tested.

coombes et al.  <cit>  reported that non-lee encoded t3ss effector  genes of non-o <dig> stec strains are correlated with outbreak and hus potential in humans. it will be interesting to examine our stec isolates for the presence of the nle genes in future studies.

many non-o <dig> stec isolated from humans and animals have shown resistance to multiple antimicrobials  <cit> , including resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and β-lactams  <cit> . stec isolates from swine feces in the united states show high resistance rates  to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and kanamycin but susceptible to nalidixic acid   <cit> . in our study, we found that only  <dig> of the  <dig> categories of antimicrobial resistance types  and  <dig> of the  <dig> antimicrobial agents  were active against all the stec isolates. the high prevalence  of resistance to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid and kanamycin is similar to that of other studies in china  <cit> . in a study  <cit>  of stec from diseased pigs in guangdong province, china, the majority of the isolates  were resistant to more than  <dig> antimicrobials and the resistance rates to chloramphenicol  and streptomycin  were far higher than that of our study . we also found that isolates from chongqing showed a higher rate than those from the other  <dig> cities in this study. it should be noted that all samples collected from chongqing were fecal samples while those from beijing and guizhou were small intestinal contents and colon contents samples, which may affect resistance profiles if different e. coli strains have a preference for the anatomic sites. however, it is more likely that the difference reflected the presence of resistant e. coli strains in different regions. chongqing was dominated by the multidrug resistant st <dig>  the differences in drug resistance rates between cities may be related to the differences in the prevalence of drug resistant sts.

comparison with sts observed in human infections gives an indication of the potential risk for human infection of the swine stec. we constructed an mst containing our sts, the  <dig> sts of the husec collection and  <dig> human stec sts from the e. coli mlst database . none of the  <dig> sts in this study was identical to any of the  <dig> sts of husec collection  <cit> . we only found one st, st <dig>  which was observed in human infections. when comparison was made at clonal complex level, some of our sts fell into the same clonal complex as the human sts . st <dig> clonal complex contained  <dig> of our sts ,  <dig> husec st  and  <dig> human stec st  from the mlst database. however, hauser et al. found that  <dig> of the  <dig> stec sts they isolated from foods shared the same sts with husec strains and were similar in their virulence gene composition  <cit> . since the stecs from foods and husec collection were from the same geographical region, it is likely some of the husec stecs were from local sources and not globally distributed. our stecs from pigs may cause local human infections but there is no surveillance of human stecs in the regions where we sampled the swine stecs.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the prevalence of stec in healthy pigs is high  by pcr screening although only  <dig> % of the swine samples yielded an stec isolate by microbiological culture. the vast majority of isolates belonged to a limited number of serogroups and serotypes, with o20:h30/ being the predominant serotype. the majority of the stec serotypes found in this study were also reported in other countries. all  <dig> stec isolates carried the pig associated stx2e subtype. only a small proportion of the stec isolates harbored hlya, ehxa and adhersin genes. based on comparison by serotypes and sequence types with human strains and presence of virulence genes, the stec isolated from pigs may have a low potential to cause human disease. however, further investigations are needed to assess their public health significance in causing human disease in china.
