BACKGROUND
brucellosis is an important disease that is causing economic losses in the cattle industry as well as health problems in humans. bovine brucellosis in korea was first detected from cattle in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, the disease had been occurred sporadically until  <dig>  and the most outbreaks had been reported in dairy cattle. in spite of the eradication program, the prevalence was continuously increased  <cit> . for the control and prevention of brucellosis, a new intensive national brucella eradication program was established and has been executed from july,  <dig> in korea, employing the test-and-slaughter and/or stamp-out approach. all cattle raised in the farms in korea are regularly tested for brucellosis and a test certificate is required before they could be moved. the brucellosis outbreaks peaked at  <dig> % of the tested cattle in  <dig> before decreasing gradually to  <dig> % in  <dig>  <cit> . in humans, one case of b. abortus infection was officially reported in  <dig>  the number of human cases has continuously increased since then. in  <dig>   <dig> human cases were reported  <cit> .

brucellosis in cattle is mainly caused by b. abortus, which causes herd production losses owing to reproductive problems. b. abortus has host preference and infect mainly cattle and other bovidae  <cit> . b. abortus has been isolated from a variety of animals, however, among foxes, coyotes, opossums, boars, and raccoons. the infection of dogs and ranched mink by b. abortus leads them to undergo abortion, and large numbers of brucella have been cultured from their fetuses and uterine exudates. vertical transmission has also been reported in coyotes. some of the b. abortus isolates came from the rats in the farms where the cattle were infected, but they do not represent a significant reservoir of brucellosis  <cit> . moreover, b. abortus can be transmitted to humans from infected animals through direct contact with the latter's aborted fetuses and fetal membranes, or through the consumption of raw milk and milk products  <cit> .

the brucella species have a high dna homology of greater than 90%  <cit> . the routine identification of the brucella species and biovars has led to their classification through classical biotyping scheme assays using the conventional microbiological tests  <cit> . a few tools have been introduced to molecular genotyping methods, such as polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms , random amplified polymorphic dna -pcr, amplified fragment length polymorphism , pulsed field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing   <cit> . none of them, however, has proven to be fully satisfactory for epidemiological investigation or for tracing strains back to their origin. the multilocus variable-number tandem repeats  analysis  methods based on the monitoring of variability in the copy numbers of tandem repeat units  for several loci were introduced to the assessment of the discrimination potential of genotype-based typing and epidemiological trace-back. tr sequences may be an interesting class of markers as multiple alleles can be presented at a single locus, and as their size differences can be easily resolved through agarose electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis equipment. mlva typing based on the number of trs copy has proven to be a rapid and effective technique for the assessment of pathogenic bacterial species with a high genetic homogeneity, such as bacillus anthracis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . it is recently announced that the mlva typing assay for the brucella species has a good species identification capability and a higher discriminatory power, and that it would thus be proposed as a complement of, or even as a substitute for, the classical biotyping methods  <cit> . moreover, this assay shows that it could discriminate the brucella isolates originating from restricted geographic sources, indicating its potential as an epidemiological tool  <cit> .

to effectively prevent and control brucellosis in korea, a molecular method for genetic identification and epidemiological trace-back must be established. as part of that, the mlva typing assay was evaluated and applied to b. abortus isolates for analyzing the characteristics of the regional distribution and relationships of foreign isolates. moreover, the mlva loci were confirmed in stability via in-vitro and in-vivo passages, and the possibility of their use as epidemiological markers for trace-back origin was investigated.

RESULTS
the tandem repeat units of  <dig> loci ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. the pcr products for  <dig> loci were converted to trs copy numbers. the pcr product sizes and sequence information usually reflected the exact changes in the number of trs and were used to predict the trs copy number in the remaining alleles. bruce  <dig>  bruce  <dig>  hoof  <dig>  bruce  <dig>  and bruce  <dig> for  <dig> b. abortus isolates were detected to have six, five, four, three, and three allelic types, respectively bruce  <dig> appeared to have the highest variability. they were shown to have mainly three or four copy numbers of the 12-bp trs unit, and the rest of the allelic types were shown to have two, five, six, and seven copy numbers. bruce  <dig> mainly populated six copy numbers, and hoof  <dig> three copy numbers. moreover, bruce  <dig> and  <dig> had four copy numbers at most . the rest of the twelve among  <dig> loci that were shown to be of a single type were determined to be stable markers for the b. abortus isolates in korea. the di value was the highest  at bruce  <dig> and was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  at bruce  <dig>  hoof  <dig>  bruce  <dig>  and bruce  <dig>  respectively .

to detect the changes in each locus for the isolates from farms, two to nine isolates originating from the same farm were selected and a total of  <dig> isolates from  <dig> farms were analyzed. the b. abortus isolates from  <dig> farms were found to be of the same type within each farm. some of the b. abortus isolates that originated from eight farms, however, were sometimes found to have two or three allelic types, which had a difference of one copy number for one to three loci . moreover, two b. abortus isolates in one cow appeared to have a different copy number for hoof  <dig> .

1) majority of the b. abortus strains were originated from different cows within the same farm.

2) a number of b. abortus strains showing different mlva profiles were counted.

3) the trs copy numbers were arranged in the following order loci bruce 04-06-07-08-09-11-12-16-18-19-21-30-42-43-45-55-hoof  <dig>  the copy numbers were indicated by bold letters and were underlined.

4) two strains isolated from one cow were detected to have different allelic types.

the b. abortus isolates showing a major mlva profile in a farm were selected to one strain in  <dig> farms. the dendrogram of strain relatedness was constructed by a character dataset using trs copy numbers for  <dig> loci. through clustering analysis using upgma, the b. abortus isolates were grouped in clusters showing a 90% similarity. the  <dig> isolates were classified into nine clusters corresponding to  <dig> genotypes. the major genotypes were d <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig>  and c <dig> . they have been distributed nationwide and are not closely connected with the provinces. in the local areas or districts, however, the epidemiological connections for the isolates appeared . the isolates with the same mlva profiles were revealed in the restricted area: in the gb <dig> and gb <dig> farms of the c <dig> genotype in the gyeonbuk yeongcheon district; in the kw <dig> and kw <dig> farms of the c <dig> genotype in kangwon cheorwon; in the jb <dig>  jb <dig>  and jb <dig> farms of the d <dig> genotype in jeonbuk jeongeup; in the cb <dig>  cb <dig>  and cb <dig> farms of the d <dig> genotype in chungbuk boeun, cheongwon, and jeungpyeng; and in the gb <dig>  gb <dig>  gb <dig>  gb <dig>  gb <dig>  gb <dig>  gb <dig>  and gb <dig> farms of the e <dig> genotype in the gyeongbuk provinces, among others. these were considered to have been directly or indirectly transferred to the nearby farms. particularly, the isolates of the h cluster in the gyeonggi kimpo area appeared in three neighboring farms in  <dig> and were not retrieved. additional outbreaks occurred in the same area in  <dig> and  <dig> .

1) they were grouped according to 90% similarity via clustering analysis, using upgma.

2) the trs copy numbers were arranged in the following order: bruce 04-06-07-08-09-11-12-16-18-19-21-30-42-43-45-55-hoof  <dig>  the copy numbers, compared with the major genotypes within a cluster, were indicated by bold letters and were underlined.

3) the b. abortus isolates showing a major mlva profile in a farm were selected .

interestingly, an isolate from the cb <dig> farm in chungbuk jecheon in  <dig> was confirmed to be b. abortus rb <dig> strain through differential amos pcr and the rifampicin resistance test . this strain coincided with the mlva profiles of the standard rb <dig> vaccine strain, and clustered together. rb <dig> vaccination was suspended in korea in  <dig>  however, as it caused abortions in pregnant cows. this result shows that there is a possibility that the rb <dig> strain can remain in the body or in a stall for above two years, if not, introduce by unknown mechanism.

for comparison with the foreign b. abortus strains, a dataset of them was downloaded from the related websites http://mlva.u-psud.fr <cit> . forty-eight foreign strains, including the reference strain and  <dig> b. abortus isolates representing the genotypes in korea, were analyzed by  <dig> loci, except for hoof  <dig>  not as information of the foreign strains. in the maximum parsimony analysis with focus on evolutionary modelling, the korean isolates were compacted and clustered independently. they were located in the middle of the european and african isolates and near the central and southern american isolates .

to confirm the stability of  <dig> loci in the same strains, their stability was examined via both the in-vitro and in-vivo passages. after more than  <dig> times of in-vitro cultivation at two- to three-day intervals, the changes of trs copy numbers for b. abortus  <dig>  b. abortus  <dig>  and two b. abortus isolates were determined. b. abortus  <dig> showed an increase in one trs copy number in the bruce  <dig> and  <dig> at passage  <dig> times, and a decrease in one trs copy number in hoof  <dig> at passage  <dig> times . but, mlva profiles for  <dig> strains except for b. abortus  <dig> were unchanged. also, to measure the stability of  <dig> loci via in-vivo passage, the b. abortus rb <dig> vaccine strains were inoculated in six native korean cattle and were re-isolated from their lymph nodes. a total of eight isolates were compared with the original b. abortus rb <dig> strain to assess the stability of  <dig> loci. the mlva profiles of the re-isolated rb <dig> strains were identical to that of the original strain, and no change was detected in them, whereas some of the b. abortus  <dig> strains re-isolated via in-vivo passage in mouse were shown to have undergone only minor changes at hoof  <dig>  three of the  <dig> isolates were found to have increased two trs copy number as compared with that of the inoculated b. abortus  <dig> strain. the mlva profiles for the rest of  <dig> loci were unchanged .

1) four strains were sub-cultured to fresh media  <dig> times by serial passages at two- to three-day intervals

2) no change after  <dig> passages

discussion
the six brucella species have been reported to have a high degree of homology  via dna-dna hybridization and their genomes are very similar in sequence, organization, and structure. moreover, an average amino acid sequence identity was reported to have a high similarity   <cit> . due to their high homology in the gene level, the brucella species were only partially differentiated with the use of the molecular genotyping methods based on a number of insertion-deletion events, several polymorphic regions , and restriction fragments by enzyme cleavage site. further, these methods were found not to be fully satisfactory for epidemiologic investigation or for tracing back strains to their origin  <cit> .

recently, a number of bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced. the analysis of the sequenced genomes revealed the presence of variable proportions of repeats, including tandem repeats. short repeat motifs are known to undergo frequent variation in the number of repeated units  <cit> . the vntrs, which are short-sequence tandem repeats, have proven to be a suitable target for assessing genetic polymorphisms within the bacterial species. vntr-based typing or mlva has been proven to be an appropriate method for bacterial typing and identification, for determining the genetic diversity, and for the trace-back of highly monomorphological species  <cit> . for the brucella species, hoof-prints, a mlva assay based on an eight-base pair tandem repeat sequence at eight loci, was introduced as a molecular method for fingerprinting the brucella isolates  <cit> . hoof-prints were not appropriate for the discrimination of the b. abortus isolates in korea because of their hypervariability, especially the hoof  <dig> and  <dig> loci, and they need to be replaced by other stable markers  <cit> 

the mlva typing assay, designated to some selections of the mlva loci, was reported to have a good species identification capability and a higher discriminatory power, and could thus be proposed as a complement of, or even as a substitute for, the classical biotyping methods  <cit> . this assay showed that it could discriminate isolates originating from restricted geographic sources, indicating its potential as an epidemiological tool  <cit> . genetic diversity of the brucella isolates must be investigated, and the epidemiological trace-back tool must be evaluated, for the effective prevention of brucellosis. thus, we endeavoured to assess the mlva typing assay of the b. abortus strains isolated in korea based on  <dig> primer sets, which were consisted of  <dig> markers described previously  <cit>  and hoof  <dig> used by hoof-prints  <cit> . hoof  <dig> was able to differentiate the b. abortus rb <dig> vaccine strain  from its mother strain, b. abortus  <dig> , and was shown to have the discrimnation power of a moderate stable marker . as it caused abortion in pregnant cattle, brucella rb <dig> vaccination was suspended in korea in  <dig>  in late  <dig>  however, one b. abortus strain isolated from dairy cattle was identified as the rb <dig> vaccine strain using the classical biotyping scheme and differential amos pcr  <cit> , and its strain was confirmed to completely coincide with the original strain by  <dig> loci, especially hoof  <dig> . this result shows that hoof  <dig> can be increased the discrimination capacity and trace-back ability of the mlva assay.

the  <dig> strains isolated from  <dig> cattle farms in nine provinces in korea from  <dig> to  <dig> were investigated in this study . bruce  <dig> appeared to have a variety of alleles, and its di value was the highest at  <dig>  . in addition, the b. abortus isolates that originated from the same farms at the same time were sometimes found to have a difference of one copy number for mainly bruce  <dig> or  <dig> . le fleche et al.  <cit>  divided the  <dig> loci into two groups, one consisting of eight loci with a good species identification capability  and another complementary group of seven loci with a high discriminatory power . bruce  <dig> was included in panel  <dig> and was reported to be a moderately variable marker. moreover, al dahouk et al.  <cit>  reported that bruce  <dig> had three alleles and a  <dig>  di for the  <dig> b. abortus strains isolated from animals . the results of this study show, however, that bruce  <dig> is a higly variable marker with six alleles and  <dig>  di, and that it is sometimes found to have a different copy number in the same farm . therefore, bruce  <dig> needs to serve as a rather discriminating marker than as a species identification marker for the b. abortus strains. bruce  <dig> , however, was found to have five alleles and a  <dig>  di, which is slightly lower than five alleles as well as a  <dig>   <cit>  and a  <dig>  di  <cit> . hoof- <dig> and bruce  <dig>  were found to have  <dig>  and  <dig>  dis, lower than the  <dig>  and  <dig>  dis  <cit>  or  <dig>  and  <dig>  dis  <cit>  previously reported. moreover, the di values at the other loci, except for bruce  <dig>  bruce  <dig>  hoof- <dig>  and bruce  <dig>  range from  <dig> to  <dig>  , which are very much lower than the 0- <dig>  dis reported in the  <dig> b. abortus isolates previously  <cit> . these low di values are as expected if the population of b. abortus isolates present in korea was the result localized by clonal expansion of b. abortus strain without the input of a new strain recently.

to detect the changes in the mlva profiles for the isolates within the same farms, a total of  <dig> isolates from  <dig> farms were analyzed. some of the b. abortus isolates that originated from seven farms were found to have two or three allelic profiles in the same farm, with a difference of one copy number for bruce  <dig>  bruce  <dig>  or hoof- <dig>  particularly, two b. abortus isolates that originated from one cow in the kw <dig> farm appeared to have one copy number difference in hoof- <dig> . in the results of the epidemiological investigation, each of the seven farms did not seem to have mixed infections from the strains that originated from different sources. in the course of replication in the body, emission to an environmental material by abortion, resistance of any external condition, and re-infection during their existence within a stall, mutants can be generated at the genetic sites that code trs. whatmore et al.  <cit>  reported, after the experimental infection of pigs with b. suis, that the strains that were re-isolated from four of six infected animals showed some minor changes, an increase or decrease in one trs copy number. they were identified to have mutation events at four loci, showing a high di within the b. suis strains. in general, random genetic events, including the insertions, deletions, and point mutations of dna, have been generated commonly in the course of an outbreak  <cit> . the brucella species are not exceptions to these genetic events. it was reported that erythritol-tolerant mutants generated a proportion ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> in the b. abortus s <dig> vaccine strain  <cit> . changes in the trs copy number of each locus are possible, and there are generally different mutant rates at different genetic sites  <cit> . an isolate is mostly considered to be closely related to the outbreak strain if its pfge pattern differs from the outbreak pattern based on the changes consistent with a single genetic event, which result in two to three band differences  <cit> . similarly, isolates that change to one copy number for one to two loci in the same farm and at the same time, especially loci that have high di values, will have to be regarded as strains that originated from the same source, or as closely related strains. thus, a cluster was classified into a group showing a 90% similarity via clustering analysis, with a difference of only one to three copy numbers .

clustering analysis was performed with major isolates selected from  <dig> farms. they were classified into nine clusters and  <dig> genotypes. the major genotypes have been distributed nationwide and their geographic characteristics have not been found. in the local areas or districts, however, genetic horizontal transfers, which are epidemiological connections for farm to farm, were detected in a majority of genotypes. moreover, some clusters  were indicated to be circulating in a specific local area, and were continuously confirmed to re-infect the neighboring farms by year . the mlva profile analysis that was conducted on the basis of the trs copy numbers of  <dig> loci showed potentiality as an epidemiological tool in the restricted area. its use as an epidemiological tool with the mlva assay has already been reported  <cit> . for  <dig> b. melitensis human isolates, the mlva assay appeared to assist with the investigation of outbreaks. the isolates that clustered together in the same mlva genotype indicated a common source of infection. according to the results of mlva assay, a laboratory technician was proved to have an infection in the laboratory. clinical, environmental, and animal isolates through the mlva assay could allow the testing of the hypotheses regarding outbreak confirmation, extent of transmission, source, and reservoir. this assay encourages the use of a molecular method in epidemiological trace-back analysis.

the maximum parsimony analysis of  <dig> foreign b. abortus strains and  <dig> korean b. abortus isolates was performed. the korean isolates were not highly divided and were compact. when comparing with database  on the website http://mlva.u-psud.fr <cit> , the korean isolates profiles were similar to the genotype  <dig> or  <dig> in panel  <dig>  but they represented new genotypes. they were located near the central and southern american isolates . these results seem to prove that the b. abortus isolates have been localized by clonal expansion without the influx of other new strains, by the strict national quarantine.

the stability of  <dig> loci was examined via both the in-vitro and in-vivo passages. in the in-vitro passage, b. abortus  <dig> showed only an increase or decrease in one trs copy number at bruce  <dig>   <dig> and hoof  <dig> toward the end of passage course . whatmore et al. reported, after three strains, the b. suis, b. melitensis, and b. abortus isolates were passaged in vitro  <dig> times over  <dig> days, that only the b. abortus isolate showed an increase in one trs copy number at one locus  towards the end of this time course  <cit> . this locus that showed a change was hypervariable to di  <dig> . the clinical isolates would, however, prior to routine, undergo the mlva assay, which indicates that in-vitro cultivation will not lead to significant changes in the mlva profiles  <cit> . to measure the stability of  <dig> loci via in-vivo passage, native korean cattle and icr mice were experimentally infected with the b. abortus strains. the b. abortus rb <dig> vaccine strains inoculated in the korean native cattle were not found to have undergone any change in  <dig> loci, but some of the b. abortus  <dig> strains that were isolated in the mice were found to have increased trs copy numbers at hoof- <dig> . although this difference was naturally caused, it may be generated in the course of the adaptation to the changes in the host. if brucella isolates are transferred to the non-preference hosts, there may be changed to trs copy numbers in some of  <dig> loci. as the b. abortus strain has infected various animals besides the bovidae, there seems to be a need for these changes to be further investigated in using the mlva assay as an epidemiological trace-back tool for transmissions between natural and heterogeneous hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
korean b. abortus isolates were clustered into nine clusters and  <dig> genotypes, although they were not highly divided and had low di values. the mlva assay showed enough discrimination power in the brucella species level and could thus be utilized as a tool for epidemiological trace-back in a restricted area. moreover, it must be considered that even in the farm that was contaminated by one source, the brucella isolates were able to undergo minor changes at some loci with high di values especially. the stability studies performed via the in-vivo and in-vitro passages showed that although further investigation may be needed to determine the stability of marker by changes of the host,  <dig> loci in this study are sufficiently stable markers for the identification of the original inoculation strain. the mlva assay can also be applied to determine the relationship between the brucella isolates from animals and from humans.
