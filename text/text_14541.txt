BACKGROUND
upon total-body irradiation , high-energy particles penetrate the body and directly or indirectly damage dna and other key molecular structures within cells. radiation causes death of rapidly proliferating cells and subsequent alterations that may lead to chronic disorders. the gastrointestinal  system is among the most radiosensitive organs in the body  <cit> . acute intestinal radiation injury is marked by massive cell death in the rapidly proliferating crypt epithelium and inflammation in the lamina propria . the death of crypt cells results in insufficient replacement of the mucosal epithelium that leads to breakdown of the mucosal barrier and bacterial translocation  <cit> . in response to injury, the gi system initiates a series of compensated signaling cascades involved in cell death, inflammation, antimicrobial responses and tissue remodelling  <cit> . activation of these signaling cascades is a spontaneous protective response of the host that could also exacerbate the destruction of tissues. for example, tumor necrosis factor α  promotes an immune response during infection, but excessive and unbalanced tnfα release can directly induce epithelial cell death and cause large-scale mucosal shedding, producing microerosions that cannot be compensated by epithelial tight junction rearrangement . in addition, although apoptosis of massively dna-damaged crypt cells prevents them from reentering the cell cycle  <cit> , the toxins released from dead cells can cause damage to surrounding tissues, which could induce a second wave of cell death  <cit> . these events occur sequentially after radiation exposure and are governed by underlying cellular and molecular responses.

because of the distinctive structures and functions of the gi tract segments, differences exist with respect to the cellular and molecular responses of each segment, depending on specific tissue radiosensitivity, damage mode, destruction magnitude and mechanism of injury. therefore, the different gi segments undergo distinct types of damage after irradiation. extensive studies have been conducted to investigate radiation-induced injuries in particular segments . small bowel is normally considered the most radiosensitive region due to its rapidly proliferating crypt cells  <cit> . it is also believed to be a major origin for gut-associated sepsis due to its lack of a thick protective mucous layer  <cit> . colon is thought to be more resistant to radiation injury, but symptoms associated with colon damage, such as diarrhea and hematochezia, have been suggested as indicators of survival after a radiation emergency  <cit> . to our knowledge, a systematic comparison among the different segments with respect to the mode, magnitude and mechanism of tbi-induced injury has not been reported. understanding the dynamic activation of key signaling pathways and the cellular and molecular responses governing injury can aid in precisely predicting and evaluating the type, mode, magnitude and mechanism of injury, as well as in developing strategies needed to alleviate injuries along the gi tract. furthermore, the above investigations support characterization of the pathophysiology of the acute radiation injury which is recognized as a regulatory requirement in drug development.

to help understand the mechanisms involved in acute intestinal radiation injury in the different gi tract segments as a basis for developing pharmacological modulators to mitigate the injury, we undertook a study in  <dig> non-human primate models in which the animals were exposed to 0 gy,  <dig>  gy or  <dig>  gy tbi. a total of  <dig> trna samples without pooling were collected from jejunum, ileum and colon at three time points  after irradiation and subjected to gene expression profiling studies and comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles, including pathway analysis. activation of signaling cascades suggests that colon undergoes the most severe mucosal barrier interruption and inflammation and that jejunum experiences the most dna damage and repair, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction. compared to jejunum and colon, ileum is the most resistant intestinal segment to radiation injury.

ipa canonical pathway analysis
activation of tight junction signaling in jejunum, ileum and colon
as epithelial tight junctions play a key role in intestinal mucosal permeability , we investigated the expression of tight junction–associated genes in the different gi segments after irradiation. the lists of transcripts altered ≥ 2-fold at each time point were imported into ipa to identify the activation of tight junction signaling pathways. analysis of the gene expression profiles revealed that tight junction signaling was only significantly activated in colon on day  <dig> after  <dig> -gy tbi; there was no significant activation in jejunum or ileum or at the other time points in colon . figure 4b lists the altered genes corresponding to the tight junction pathway. radiation induced very few altered genes in jejunum and ileum. however,  <dig> gy tbi induced  <dig> genes with mrna level altered ≥ 2-fold in colon at day  <dig>  of these genes, cldn <dig> was strikingly increased 105- and 196-fold after  <dig> -gy and  <dig> -gy tbi, respectively. expression of cldn <dig>  cldn <dig>  cldn7 and cldn <dig> were all significantly down-regulated. all of these changes were substantially attenuated on days  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> comparative analysis demonstrates that the tight junction signaling pathway is only activated in colon on day  <dig> after  <dig>  gy tbi . pathways with a –log value  above the threshold  were significantly activated. altered transcripts involved in tight junction signaling in jejunum, ileum and colon at the different time points after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi . the font color of a <dig> to a <dig> represents segment of jejunum , ileum  and colon . a <dig> to a <dig> represent the time point of days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi



activation of immune response pathways in jejunum, ileum and colon
the analysis by ipa of activation of immune response pathways in jejunum, ileum and colon showed that tbi induced a wide activation of these pathways in all three intestinal segments at day  <dig>  with significant suppression of the activated pathways at days  <dig> and  <dig> . the activation was dose- and region-dependent, with colon exposed to  <dig> -gy tbi showing the highest degree of pathway activation and ileum exposed to  <dig> -gy tbi showing the least activation. various immune response pathways in jejunum were activated on day  <dig> after  <dig> -gy tbi and were suppressed at day  <dig> . a comparative analysis of granulocyte adhesion and agranulocyte adhesion signaling in relation to diapedesis in jejunum, ileum and colon on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after  <dig> -gy and  <dig> -gy tbi identified pathways significantly activated above the threshold –log value  . granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion signaling and diapedesis were significantly activated at day  <dig> in all three segments, with colon the most activated site. these activations were significantly suppressed at days  <dig> and  <dig>  the altered genes regulating granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis pathways in jejunum, ileum and colon at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after  <dig> -gy and  <dig> -gy tbi are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> the various immune response signaling pathways activated in jejunum on day  <dig> after  <dig>  gy tbi were significantly suppressed by day  <dig>  stacked bar charts demonstrate ipa-generated activated pathways after irradiation. the width of a bar indicates the percentage of transcripts that changed in the particular pathway . pathways with a p-value  above the threshold  were significantly regulated . a comparative analysis of granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion signaling and diapedesis in jejunum, ileum and colon on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi revealed pathways that were significantly activated above the threshold –log value   



activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor -mediated apoptosis in jejunum, ileum and colon
tbi induced significant activation of ahr-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway. ahr was strongly activated at day  <dig> after both tbi doses in all intestinal segments, with jejunum the most activated segment, and was significantly suppressed or attenuated in all segments at days  <dig> and  <dig> . figure 6b lists the altered genes corresponding to the ahr signaling pathway. tbi also activated other apoptotic signaling pathways, such as death receptor signaling ; however, the magnitude of activation of these pathways was much lower than that of the ahr-mediated apoptosis pathway.fig.  <dig> tbi induced significant activation of the ahr-mediated apoptosis signaling pathway in jejunum, ileum and colon at the early time point of 4 days after tbi. pathways with a –log value  above the threshold  were significantly activated . genes involved in ahr signaling altered at the different time points after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi 



activation of cell cycle signaling pathways in jejunum, ileum and colon
in response to radiation-induced dna damage, pathways regulating cell cycle control and dna damage repair signaling were activated. activation of pathways regulating the g2/m dna damage checkpoint regulation, mitotic roles of polo-like kinases, and atm signaling in jejunum was significant at day  <dig> at both tbi doses and was significantly suppressed at day  <dig> . no significant activation of these pathways was observed in ileum or colon. figure 7b lists the genes whose expression were altered involved in the g2/m dna damage checkpoint regulation pathway.fig.  <dig> activation of cell cycle control and dna damage repair signaling pathway in jejunum, ileum and colon after tbi. pathways with a –log value  above the threshold  were significantly activated . genes involved in g2/m dna damage checkpoint regulation altered at the different time points after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi 



activation of coagulation system in jejunum, ileum and colon
analysis of cellular stress and injury signaling identified significant activation of the coagulation system in jejunum at day  <dig> after irradiation at both tbi doses, with complete suppression at days  <dig> and  <dig> . activation of the coagulation system was marginally significant in ileum or colon. figure 8b lists the genes whose expression were altered involved in the coagulation system.fig.  <dig> tbi induced significant activation of the coagulation system in jejunum, but not in ileum or colon. pathways with a –log value  above the threshold  were significantly regulated . genes involved in the coagulation system altered at the different time points after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi 



up-regulation of anoikis signaling and tnf-mediated matrix-dissociated genes
tbi induced significant up-regulation of eda2r in all three segments after both radiation doses. eda2r is a type iii transmembrane protein of the tnf receptor superfamily that is associated with mediating anoikis, the increase of eda2r mrna expression reached a maximum at day  <dig> and gradually returned toward the baseline at days  <dig> and  <dig> . radiation also induced marked up-regulation of various matrix metalloproteinases . the up-regulated mmps in colon include mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  and in jejunum mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  in ileum, only mmp <dig> was significantly induced. in addition to various types of mmps, we identified a striking increase of lcn <dig> in colon at day  <dig>  , which was significantly suppressed at day  <dig>  the striking increase of lcn <dig> only occurred in colon, not in jejunum and ileum . ipa upstream analysis showed that these induced mmp genes and lcn <dig> were directly activated by tnfα .fig.  <dig> up-regulation of eda2r and matrix-dissociated transcripts in jejunum, ileum and colon after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi



immunohistochemistry for tnfα
immunohistochemistry was performed on colon tissue sections from control and irradiated samples collected on study day  <dig> after  <dig> -gy tbi. staining for tnfα was very weak across the normal colon section, except for some visible signals distributed as a streak underneath the intact mucosal epithelial lining . in the irradiated colon section, a significant increase in tnfα staining was observed in the mucosa, submucosa and serosa . in the mucosal region close to the epithelial barrier, tnfα had accumulated as a strong streak that formed an interface between swollen/disrupted cells and normal-shaped cells .fig.  <dig> immunohistochemistry in colon tissue sections for tnfα protein. in unirradiated colon, tnfα protein is weakly distributed across the section; however, a streak of some visible signals can be seen beneath the intact mucosal epithelial lining . at day  <dig> after  <dig> -gy tbi, tnfα staining in the interstitial space from serosa to mucosa and submucosa of the colon exhibits significantly increased tnfα staining. note the strong streak of tnfα staining in the mucosal region close to the epithelial barrier, forming an interface between swollen/disrupted cells and normal-shaped cells 



discussion
this comparative analysis of the gene expression profiles of jejunum, ileum and colon obtained at three time points  from rhesus macaque models exposed to  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi has yielded valuable insights into the differences in the radiosensitivity of these segments, as well as differences with respect to damage mode, destruction magnitude, and mechanism of injury. pathway analysis of the gene expression profiles identified radiation-induced time-, dose- and segment-dependent activation of tnfα cascade, tight junction, apoptosis, cell cycle control/dna damage repair and coagulation system signaling. on the basis of the activation of these signaling cascades and pathways, colon sustained the most severe mucosal barrier interruption and inflammation, and jejunum the most dna damage, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction. compared to colon and jejunum, ileum was the most resistant segment to radiation exposure.

the tnfα cascade was identified as the upstream regulator of gene expression profile changes after tbi with the highest activation score as defined by ipa upstream regulator analysis. activation of tnfα differed by intestinal segment, with colon showing the highest level of activation and ileum the lowest. tnfα cascade activation was also time-dependent, occurring at day  <dig> and then being completely suppressed at days  <dig> and  <dig>  tnfα is a pro-inflammatory molecule that regulates multiple cellular processes  <cit> . in intestine, it regulates inflammation, mucus secretion, cell survival and death . its protective or destructive role primarily depends on the dosage and activation of secondary signaling pathways. for example, tnfα overexpression by exogenous administration or specific knock-in induces abnormal epithelial shedding producing microerosions that cannot be sealed by tight junction rearrangement  <cit> . clinically, many studies have implicated tnfα’s intricate link to intestinal barrier disruption in inflammatory bowel diseases such as crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis  <cit> . in irradiated colon, where the tnfα cascade was highly activated, histology revealed large-scale epithelial shedding with more severe barrier disruption than in other gi segments.

the distribution pattern of immunohistochemical staining for tnfα in irradiated colon demonstrates a direct involvement of tnfα in radiation-induced mucosal shedding. at day  <dig> after  <dig>  gy tbi, the interstitial space from serosa to mucosa showed a marked increase of tnfα staining, and, in an intriguing finding, a strong streak representing accumulation of tnfα was observed in the mucosal region close to the epithelial barrier, separating abnormally from normally shaped cells . regulation of intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury by tnfα has undergone extensive study. targeting of tnfα with antibodies has been successfully used in the clinical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease for many years, highlighting the importance and clinical relevance of tnfα’s function in intestinal inflammation  <cit> . our finding in normal colon of a visible streak of tnfα closely adjacent to the base of the epithelial lining  suggests that tnfα could act as a sentinel in the response to barrier disruption.

of the tnfα downstream targets, genes regulating cellular dissociation including mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig> and lcn <dig> were strikingly increased in colon tissue after  <dig>  gy irradiation. among these in colon, mmp <dig> was increased 11- and 41-fold after  <dig>  and  <dig>  gy tbi, and lcn <dig> was increased 58- and 52-fold, respectively. epithelial mmp- <dig> breaks down extracellular matrix  and activates α-defensin produced by paneth cells  <cit> . lcn <dig> protein, also called ngal , can form a complex with mmp- <dig> and strongly enhance and preserve mmp- <dig> activity  <cit> . the strikingly increased expression of these matrix degradation genes inevitably causes cells to lose their attachment to the surrounding ecm. in addition, radiation induced strong expression of eda2r, a member of the tnf receptor family that mediates p53-regulated anoikis  <cit> . anoikis is a form of programmed cell death induced by detachment of anchorage-dependent cells from the surrounding ecm. eda2r protein negatively regulates focal adhesion kinase, a central component of focal adhesion. in humans, activated eda2r gives rise to a clinical syndrome characterized by loss of hair, sweat glands and teeth  <cit> . we hypothesize that activation of the eda2r and tnfα cascades plays a key role in radiation-induced mucosal shedding in colon. interestingly, these matrix degradation genes showed a much lower increase in jejunum and ileum than in colon.

intestinal mucosal barrier disruption in response to tbi changes the barrier’s permeability. our investigation of the expression of epithelial tight junction–associated genes in the different gi segments after irradiation revealed that only colon exposed to  <dig>  gy tbi caused significant  changes in numerous tight junction genes at day  <dig>  with very few alterations in expression of tight junction–associated genes observed in jejunum and ileum . in intestine, tight junction proteins form a barrier against unlimited paracellular passage of solutes and water; they also form channels allowing distinct permeation across the barrier  <cit> . among the tight junction–associated genes that were up-regulated after irradiation was cldn <dig>  which showed striking 106- and 196-fold increases after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi, respectively. cldn <dig> protein  has been shown to be of great clinical impact. it is a predominant pore-forming protein for selective transportation of water and small cations  . an increase of cldn <dig> protein expression causes excessive diffusion of ions and water from blood to lumen, leading to leak-flux diarrhea  <cit> . cldn <dig> expression can be induced by tnfα and has been reported in various diseases, including crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and celiac disease  <cit> . in patients with crohn’s disease, the expression of cldn <dig> is dramatically up-regulated, especially in patients with low expression of the sealing tight junction protein cldn <dig>   <cit> . in our studies, up-regulated expression of cldn <dig> after  <dig>  gy tbi was also accompanied with a wide down-regulation of sealing tight junction genes, including cldn <dig>  which was down-regulated 20-fold. these data suggest a direct link between tight junction disruption and the diarrhea observed in most of the irradiated animals from days  <dig> to  <dig> 

activation of the tnfα cascade and tight junction signaling suggests that colon suffered the severest mucosal barrier disruption after tbi. this conclusion is further supported by the activation of immune response signaling pathways observed among the segments. breakdown of the mucosal barrier causes bacterial translocation into the deep gut tissue and triggers an immune response and inflammation. activation of these signaling pathways enables the organism to defend itself against infectious microbes. the magnitude of activation reflects the degree of tissue injury. among the segments studied, colon had the greatest number of altered immune response transcripts and the highest magnitude of change. for example, the il1a gene was increased 14- and 34-fold in colon at day  <dig> after  <dig>  gy and  <dig>  gy tbi, respectively, but was not induced in jejunum and ileum. the same was the case with ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  mmp <dig> and cldn <dig>  these transcripts were markedly up-regulated in colon but not induced in jejunum and ileum. in addition, cxcl <dig> was increased 61- and 56-fold in colon at day  <dig> after  <dig> -gy and  <dig> -gy tbi, respectively, but only 7- and 4-fold in jejunum and ileum after the higher-dose tbi. these data seem reasonable in view of the disruption of the epithelial barrier in colon, the largest reservoir of microorganisms  <cit> , which would prompt a strong defensive reaction to fight against the invading pathogens. as was the case with activation of the tnfα cascade and tight junction signaling, activation of the immune response was time-dependent, with day  <dig> as the most activated time point. at days  <dig> and  <dig>  the activated immune response pathways were significantly suppressed.

in contrast to the colon, where tnfα cascade, tight junction and immune response signaling were most highly activated; jejunum was the segment with the strongest activation of apoptosis, cell cycle control/dna damage repair and coagulation system signaling after irradiation. after radiation exposure, a wave of apoptosis normally occurs within a few hours. but in this study, we found significant activation of ahr-mediated apoptotic signaling at day  <dig> after both doses of tbi, with jejunum the most activated segment. ahr was originally characterized as a regulator of xenobiotic metabolism and currently is considered an important mediator of toxic responses  <cit> . activation of ahr signaling could be associated with the second wave of apoptosis induced by the toxicity generated by reactive oxygen species, ruptured cells or invasive microorganisms. tbi induced a wide activation of pathways that regulate cell cycle control and dna damage repair  <cit> . surprisingly, activation of various dna damage repair pathways occurred in jejunum, not in ileum or colon. the lack of dna damage repair might explain why colon has a higher incidence of adenocarcinoma  <cit> . previous studies, including ultrastructural studies, have shown that endothelial cells are also among the most radiation-sensitive cell types  <cit> . radiation induced a significant activation of coagulation system signaling in jejunum at day  <dig>  the strongest activation of the coagulation system in jejunum, but not ileum or colon, could be due to the abundance of blood capillaries in jejunal villi for nutrient absorption  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first systematic comparative study of the molecular and cellular responses to radiation injury in jejunum, ileum and colon. activation of signaling cascades suggests that colon undergoes the most severe mucosal barrier interruption and inflammation and that jejunum experiences the most dna damage and repair, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction. these more pronounced alterations correlate with the high incidence of macroscopic pathologies that are observed in the colon after total body irradiation. compared to jejunum and colon, ileum is the most resistant intestinal segment to radiation injury. the strongest activation of tnfα cascades and the striking up-regulation of its down-stream matrix-dissociated genes suggest that tnfα modulation could be a target for mitigating radiation-induced mucosal barrier disruption. future studies will verify these findings at the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels.
