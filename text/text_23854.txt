BACKGROUND
the popularity of real time pcr steadily increases as well as the number of platforms, detection chemistries and multiple choices of analytical methods. several years ago, the boom in high-throughput instruments changed the way of studying gene expression and enabled researchers to perform large scale studies based on the most sensitive and specific quantitative pcr method. the first commercially available high-throughput qpcr instrument was the biomark™ system from fluidigm that was launched in  <dig>  microfluidic dynamic arrays provided by fluidigm are able to combine either  <dig> samples with  <dig> assays or  <dig> samples with  <dig> assays in a combinatorial manner inside the integrated fluidic circuit   <cit> . the biomark system is able to process a high number of reactions  in a single run, each reaction taking place in volume of  <dig>  nl  <cit> . with this number of reactions in a single run and its versatility and the freedom of the custom designed assays, biomark system outperforms other high-throughput qpcr systems. there are only a few high-throughput qpcr instruments on the market that can be compared with biomark system: openarray using a chip with  <dig>  reactions, each for 33-nanolitre reaction volumes   <cit>  and smartchip with  <dig>  reactions, each for 100-nanolitre reaction volumes   <cit> . all these systems are designed to significantly simplify experimental workflow, increase throughput and reduce costs, while providing excellent data quality. even though these instruments are built on different platforms, one attribute is common for all of them and that is a need for highly concentrated starting sample material.

the problem with an insufficient number of copies of the target in the reaction can be overcome with the help of pre-amplification. for the purposes of biomark system a specific target amplification  is used, which is a multiplex pcr run with cdna template and with a limited number of cycles, which is an exponential type of pre-amplification enabling simultaneous gene expression measuring of multiple targets in a single sample  <cit> . this kind of pre-amplification increases the amount of the initial cdna or dna template molecules several-fold, quantitatively amplifies just the target genes to be measured, and preserves the relationships between the transcripts. even though pre-amplification has been used for many years  <cit>  and it has been incorporated in high-throughput qpcr instruments workflows  <cit> , it is still the least studied part of qpcr workflow that might introduce an additional bias if it is used without caution and appropriate controls.

in last few years, we witnessed that along with new techniques and new bioinformatic approaches come praiseworthy effort for proper standardization and control of the whole experimental process to eliminate widespread publication of poor data, resulting in inappropriate conclusions  <cit> . because of the initiator of the whole process, miqe guidelines  <cit> , the quality and transparency of the laboratory results has been improved considerably. pre-amplification process should not be omitted from this effort and it should be thoroughly validated and correctly reported as well as other parts of reverse transcription-qpcr workflow. it means that controls of pre-amplification should include at least paired non-preamplified and pre-amplified samples and each assay should be tested independently before the main experiment as described by rusnakova  <cit> . for unbiased pre-amplification, the same difference between cq values of non-preamplified and pre-amplified cdna samples is expected for all assays; only reproducible small deviations are acceptable. reproducibility is critical. other controls as pre-amplified no template control  and pre-amplified control of reverse transcription without reverse transcriptase  should also be included. the reason is to ensure that quantification will not be influenced by eventual primer-dimer formation or by assays that would amplify gdna. rt- control could be successfully replaced by a valid prime assay, which accurately corrects all reactions in biomark array for signals derived from gdna using only one extra valid prime assay and pre-amplified genomic dna   <cit> . as the pre-amplification reaction is a highly complex multiplex system , simultaneous amplifications of the large number of targets may interfere; therefore it is necessary to use highly optimized qpcr assays with high efficiency and high precision and to run only a limited number of cycles and avoiding high-abundant targets if possible  <cit> . even though it is possible to use fewer cycles of pre-amplification  for qpcr experiments with conventional qpcr instruments, high-throughput qpcr experiments require more than  <dig> pre-amplification cycles. fluidigm advanced protocols recommend 14 cycles for conventional profiling  <cit>  and 18 cycles for single-cell profiling  <cit> . these numbers of pre-amplification cycles are calculated for highly optimized assays but in practice pre-amplification pcr efficiencies are not close to 100% that is why these numbers are minimal and often suboptimal  <cit> .

here, we focus on identifying factors which influence the pre-amplification reaction and the pre-amplification limits, especially a limiting higher number of cycles for pre-amplification, which has not been studied systematically yet. our aim is to find out the optimal conditions for biomark array that would give us an optimal distribution of quantifiable cq values across the array by using the proper amount of mrna transferred into a reverse transcription reaction; the proper fraction of the cdna used for pre-amplification and the proper fraction of the pre-amplified and correctly diluted cdna, transferred into each sample well in biomark array.

RESULTS
evaluating variables in pre-amplification reaction using regular qpcr instrument
the primary purpose of pre-amplification is to enhance amount of input material, which can be, in some instances, very low even for conventional qpcr: single cell analysis  <cit> , microrna analysis  <cit> , analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffine embedded tissues  <cit>  or to enhance initial amount of material to be sufficient for high-throughput instrument  <cit> . the amount of pre-amplified transcripts correlates with the initial cdna target copy numbers as has been shown previously for both good quality samples  <cit>  and bad quality samples, e.g. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples  <cit> . the exponential pre-amplification should not be affected by the quality of original rna because the product of reverse transcription, cdna molecule, is pre-amplified. that is why the quality of rna will influence only the reverse transcription step.

even though the pre-amplification reaction itself is quite simple, there are several factors that can influence the final result. to identify and evaluate these factors we performed pre-amplification experiment combining different conditions. we evaluated four donors and five genes having high, medium and low expression levels. the genes were fkbp, stk <dig>  eif3m, cd <dig>  and rnd <dig> and were selected as representative from  <dig> well-characterized assays  that were used later on for the summarizing biomark experiment. their mean cq values for four non-pre-amplified samples were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , respectively, which expression is spanning four orders of magnitude of dynamic range. each sample was pre-amplified using four different cycles  and at five different concentrations . the copy number of each transcript and sample was estimated for each assay. the estimated copy number for the low expressed gene rnd <dig> was confirmed by dpcr. the limit of detection , the limit of quantification  and the efficiency were determined for all  <dig> assays .

obtained non-pre-amplified cq data and pre-amplified cq data were subtracted to calculate an ‘experimental difference’ of pre-amplification: Δcqexperimental = cqnon-preamp – cqpreamp. a ‘theoretical difference’ of pre-amplification was calculated as: Δcqtheoretical = number of pre-amplification cycles – log <dig> . the final formula was ΔΔcq = Δcqtheoretical - Δcqexperimental. an obtained ΔΔcq value, ‘expression differential’, close to zero indicates pre-amplification uniformity . we set ΔΔcq =  <dig>  as a quality threshold for an acceptable pre-amplification. this threshold value is in agreement with the threshold value recommended by applied biosystems in taqman preamp master mix kit guide  <cit> . the values lower than the quality threshold  were named a ‘success’. the values higher than a quality threshold and the missing values, caused by missing copies in the reaction, were categorized as a ‘failure’  .

in order to evaluate which factors affect the ‘success’ of pre-amplification, we tested these data variables: cycles , log_copy , log_concentn , donor, geneno  that were used in explanatory binomial candidate model. the optimal model was then derived in spss using the backward stepwise method to eliminate non-significant terms, which were donor and log_copy. because all terms are known beforehand and controllable, the model could serve also as a predictive model with sensitivity of 81% and specifity 67% .

individual statistical tests uncovered important details of the pre-amplification process. concentration of cdna sample used for pre-amplification had significant effect on the overall likelihood of ‘success’ when tested for all genes and cycles together ; the higher concentration, the higher ‘success’ . when individual genes were taken in account and all cycles were together, concentration had significant effect only on low copy genes, rnd <dig>  and cd <dig>  . both genes show high failure rates in the low concentrated pre-amplification reactions  because the low template concentration corresponds to the low number of copies in pre-amplification . these findings are in agreement with bengtsson  <cit> , who claims that when amplifying less than  <dig> cdna copies the level of technical noise of pcr amplification increases dramatically, technical reproducibility decreases, thus the accurate quantification is reached if > <dig> target molecules per pcr are amplified.

copy number of cdna used for pre-amplification was not significant in the predictive model because copy number  did not have a significant effect on the overall likelihood of ‘success’ when all genes and all cycles were combined together  . however, if each gene was tested independently with all cycles together, the same results as for variable concentration were obtained. copy number had significant effect on low copy genes rnd <dig>  and cd <dig>  . additional information was derived if copy number was compared for all genes and each cycle independently. whereas the likelihood of ‘success’ increased with increasing copy number for cycles  <dig>  and  <dig> , it decreases for cycle  <dig> . the contradictory directions for individual cycles can explain why there was no overall significant effect above . the increasing ‘success‘of pre-amplification with higher copy numbers has been described before, for example, using different copy numbers of ercc rna- <dig> standard with 14 cycles of pre-amplification  <cit> . however, the effect of high copy number transcripts combined with higher pre-amplification cycles  has not been systematically investigated for bulk experiments before.

finally, effect of number of cycles on pre-amplification ‘success’ was tested. we show that the number of cycles had a highly significant effect on overall likelihood of ‘success’  if tested for all genes and concentration together. increasing cycle numbers decreased the likelihood of ‘success’ . if both genes and cycles were tested independently, cycle number had significant effect only on high copy genes eif3m , stk <dig>  and fkbp . increasing cycle numbers drastically decreased the likelihood of ‘success’ . the presence of highly abundant transcripts has also effect on pre-amplification process, this effect was combined with number of cycles. while pre-amplifiying  <dig> and 24 cycles, the quality of pre-amplification steeply dropped, which is shown in summary figure . the percentage of affected genes displayed in this figure can be found in additional file  <dig>  this would probably be caused by getting under optimal concentration of primers in the multiplex pre-amplification reaction. the possibility of exhausting reagents during qpcr reaction was ruled out by testing limiting dilutions of pcr product of fkbp .figure  <dig> 
a plot showing the quality of pre-amplification. successfully pre-amplified samples lie bellow the quality threshold, which corresponds to ΔΔcq =  <dig>  . the quality of pre-amplification gets worse with increasing number of pre-amplification cycles. during cycles  <dig> and  <dig> only small number of samples amplified with low copy gene rnd <dig>  and high copy gene fkbp are affected. at cycles  <dig> and  <dig>  the quality of pre-amplification is affected in all genes to some extent. the least affected gene is cd <dig>  the most affected are high copy genes.



applying the results, we can speculate why 18 s rrna, which is often used as a reference gene using conventional qpcr would not be suitable transcript for pre-amplification as was also suggested by stahlberg  <cit> . the previously published data demonstrated that the highest correlation observed for samples pre-amplified with 18 s rrna measured with microfluidic biomark array and non-preamplified samples measured by conventional qpcr cycler was  <dig>   <cit> . the expression of 18 s rrna is so abundant that we recommend to exclude it from pre-amplification reaction completely. 18 s rrna would not be detected reliably because of the very high concentration of transcripts present after pre-amplification. this reason would cause the inability of any instrument to set the correct baseline. on the other hand, for the same reason, it is possible to quantify 18 s rrna in biomark array without pre-amplification . the simple clue for identifying possible unsuitable targets for pre-amplification is their measured cq value. the cq value of the non-preamplified high-abundant transcript should not be lower than the number of cycles being used for its pre-amplification.

after summarizing all results together, combination of significant variables cycle and concentration reveals that a cycle  <dig> or  <dig> combined with a concentration of 20 ng is the best pre-amplification option using good quality samples, although any concentration higher than  <dig>  ng is likely to be sufficient if the cycle is  <dig> or  <dig> . in other words, the solution is to minimize number of cycles and maximize concentration of the sample. presented model  can also be applied for degraded samples, e.g. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. if rna samples are degraded, less cdna could be formed during reverse transcription, thus less target copies of cdna can be pre-amplified. using our outcomes , the highly expressed transcripts will never be over-preamplificated. however, the right concentration and dilution of samples need to be tested for the low expressed genes.table  <dig>

optimal dilution for biomark system
the regular biomark high-throughput gene expression experiment consists of high number of assays   <cit>  that are amplified at the same time, resulting in the big spread of cq values from highly expressed to lowly expressed genes. if either the concentration of the sample, the number of pre-amplification cycles or dilution after pre-amplification are not set correctly, the final result will not be optimal. some transcripts could be under-amplified, which can result in a loss of detection sensitivity and generation of missing values. we should also avoid over-cycling of highly expressed transcripts. if the concentration of copies for a certain assay is too high in the sample, the instrument might not be able to distinguish the background of the reaction and set the baseline properly. the obtained cq values will not be reliable.

for a successful biomark experiment, it is desirable for the majority of the data to fall in the range about cq =  <dig> to cq =  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the regular qpcr cyclers, the optimal range of quantifiable cq values in biomark instrument is approximately 10 cycles lower  <cit> . this is caused by the fundamental difference between the size of the surface that comes into contact with the sample mix during the qpcr reaction in the dynamic array and in the conventional micro-titer plate. in contrast to the polypropylene surface in conventional micro-titer plates, the percentage of surface of polydimethylsiloxane nanochamber  <cit>  that is connected with the reaction volume is much larger. it leads to a higher sensitivity of the microfluidic system, earlier detection of the fluorescence signal and thus shorter cycling time.

in order to identify the best concentration and dilution of pre-amplified samples that would be suitable for the biomark experiment, we performed an experiment with  <dig>  ge dynamic array using already pre-amplified samples from previous experiment with cycles  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively and with the concentrations  <dig>  ng, 5 ng and 20 ng, respectively. the samples were diluted  <dig> and  <dig> fold, respectively to determine the best conditions for biomark instrument. all obtained cq data  was normalized with gapdh, ppib and gusb reference genes, which should cancel out the differences among the different concentrations and different amplification cycles but not the natural variability among donors. we set these criteria: missing data were not acceptable, the lowest cq in dynamic array should be  <dig> and three samples should be distinguished and fall into respective groups. that is why, the two lowest concentrations  for 15 cycle pre-amplification were removed from the analysis immediately. these criteria helped us to set up the principal component analysis that was used to reduce the dimensionality of a data set, which consisted of the  <dig> normalized gene assays,  <dig> pre-amplification cycles,  <dig> dilutions and  <dig> concentrations of  <dig> samples. pca data was auto-scaled to reduce the effect of variation in the overall expression levels of the different genes. only samples that created three separated compact groups were selected for further analysis. after removal of all samples pre-amplified 21 cycles and samples pre-amplified 18 cycles of concentration  <dig>  ng, the data set was reanalyzed and the first  <dig> components of pca explained  <dig> % variability of auto-scaled data set. the right choice of selected samples from pca was validated with another method, kohonen’s self-organizing feature map  that confirmed separation of samples into  <dig> distinct groups .figure  <dig> 
identification of the best concentration and dilution of pre-amplified samples for the biomark experiment. a. 3-d principal component analysis. pca is based on  <dig> differentially expressed, auto-scaled genes, which classified pre-amplified samples into three groups according to donors . samples pre-amplified  <dig>   <dig> and 21 cycles are shown, diluted both 20x and 40x. it is difficult to distinguish clearly  <dig> groups. b. only acceptable pre-amplifications useful for biomark ge dynamic array are selected: 15 cycles - 20 ng, dilution 20x and 40x, respectively; 18 cycles –  <dig> and 20 ng, dilution 20x and 40x, respectively. c. som with samples selected for figure 2b, confirms  <dig> distinct groups.



as a result, the highest concentration, 20 ng, for 15 cycles pre-amplification, both 20x and 40x diluted; and 5 ng and 20 ng concentrations for 18 cycles of pre-amplification, both 20x and 40x diluted fulfilled our criteria for successful and reliable pre-amplification and would give the best unbiased result with maximum detectable data for biomark gene expression experiment.

pre-amplification variability
in order to demonstrate how the combination of optimal conditions for success of pre-amplification would affect variability, the yield and standard deviations  of pre-amplified fkbp, stk <dig>  eif3m, cd <dig>  and rnd <dig> were measured by qpcr. pre-amplification reactions were performed in replicates of four on one cdna that was synthetized from the same rna pool. sdpre of combined pre-amplification and qpcr  was calculated as weighted sum of the sds of the qpcr  and sd of the pre-amplification reaction . sdpre was in the range of  <dig>  –  <dig> , which corresponds to variability 10% - 17% in estimated number of cdna molecules . variability increases towards the low expressed genes with higher cq values , which is caused by well described statistical effects  <cit> .table  <dig>

previously, it has been described that experimental variation in the reverse transcription-qpcr  is mainly attributable to the reverse transcription step  <cit> . to confirm this statement also for reverse transcription–qpcr with the additional pre-amplification step, we performed the experiment where the yield and standard deviations of cdna synthesis of the fkbp, stk <dig>  eif3m, cd <dig>  and rnd <dig> were measured by qpcr. this time reverse transcription reactions were performed in replicates of four on material from the same rna pool as in previous pre-amplification experiment . sdrt of combined reverse transcription and qpcr  was calculated as weighted sum of the sds of the qpcr  and sd of the rt reaction . sdrt was in the range of  <dig>  –  <dig> , which corresponds to variability 17% - 33% in estimated number of cdna molecules . after comparison, the pre-amplification variability within the reverse transcription-qpcr experiment is significantly lower  than variability caused by cdna synthesis step.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to perform a valid experiment that would lead to reliable results, it is necessary to know both the capabilities and limitations of the used method and instrument. even though biomark instrument performs the regular qpcr reaction, we need to take some special properties into account when setting high-throughput qpcr experiment. the most distinct deviation from the regular qpcr experiment workflow is the necessity of pre-amplification.

as has been demonstrated, pre-amplification success is based on several variables, the most important ones are number of pre-amplification cycles, concentration of the sample used for pre-amplification, and the gene itself. after testing possible combinations of these variables, we came to the conclusion that pre-amplification for the biomark system using good quality samples is optimal between 15– <dig> pre-amplification cycles and higher concentrations of cdna samples  diluted either 20x or 40x after pre-amplification. use of higher amplification cycles  in bulk experiments  is very limited because high abundant targets will cause an exhaustion of primers and reagents from pre-amplification reaction, thus they will cause lowering of pre-amplification success.

the success of the pre-amplification can be tested by our improved, easy-to-obtain, universal formula called “expression differential”. the algorithm, which is presented here, evaluates the "expression differential" based on a ΔΔcq value obtained subtracting Δcq experimental - Δcq expected or "theoretical". formula can be used universally, for pre-testing of the quality of pre-amplification assays in high-throughput gene expression experiment as well as in rt-qpcr experiments with ffpe-rna.

and finally, we show that variability of the pre-amplification, introduced into the experimental workflow of reverse transcription-qpcr, is lower than variability caused by the reverse transcription step.
