BACKGROUND
rasgrf <dig> is a mammalian guanine nucleotide exchange factor  for ras gtpases  which is specifically expressed at central nervous system locations, testis and pancreas   <cit> , although various isoforms thereof are also expressed in a variety of other tissues  <cit> . rasgrf <dig> specifically promotes gdp/gtp exchange on various members of the ras gtpase family including the three canonical ras isoforms , m-ras, r-ras,  <cit> , and rac  <cit> . the rasgrf <dig> proteins act by coupling different upstream stimuli to activation of various intracellular pathways through the specific contribution of some of its structural domains, including the cdc25-h domain capable of activating ras family members, the ca+2/calmodulin interacting iq domain  <cit> , two ph domains, or a dh  domain capable of activating rho/rac family gtpases  <cit> . due to this complex domain structure, rasgrf <dig> is able to couple ras activation to different signal transduction processes, such as those mediated by ca2+/calmodulin  <cit> , heterotrimeric g proteins  <cit> , camp activity  <cit> , cdc <dig>  <cit> , or even non-receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> .

rasgrf <dig> ko mice exhibit defects in memory consolidation  <cit> , reduced body size, deficiency of igf- <dig> and growth hormone, and hypoinsulinemia  <cit> . our analysis of the rasgrf <dig> ko mice showed significant reduction of pancreatic islet number and size, linked to diminished beta cell proliferation and neogenesis, and resulting in hypoinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and prediabetic state  <cit> . rasgrf <dig> elimination is also associated to defective eye phenotypes including impaired retinal photoreception  <cit>  and altered lens growth  <cit> .

multiple reports suggest the participation of ras signaling pathways, and rasgrf <dig> in particular, in the control of pancreatic islet and beta cell development and function. for example, male transgenic mice overexpressing human h-ras develop β-cell degeneration and onset of diabetes, exhibiting hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hypoinsulinemia  <cit> , and ras inhibition in mouse cells leads to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake  <cit> . it has also been shown in human islet cells that glucose and glucagon-like peptide- <dig> activate the rap/b-raf signaling module, thus mediating erk and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation  <cit> . additional reports have also demonstrated the participation of ras signaling in the response of beta cells to prolactin  <cit>  and the contribution of hnf-4a, rasgrf <dig> and other putative rasgefs, such as st <dig>  as modulators of ras/erk activity in those cells  <cit> . furthermore, rasgrf <dig> has also been implicated in insulin secretion induced by the transient diabetes mellitus gene zac <dig>  <cit> . finally, our observations in small-bodied rasgrf <dig> ko mice of hypoinsulinemia, reduced pancreatic beta cell mass, and defective activation of ras signaling after stimulation of isolated islet cells with igf <dig>  are also strongly indicative of an essential role of rasgrf <dig> in beta cell proliferation and neogenesis  <cit> . in this regard, the very strong similarity observable between the pancreatic phenotypes of our rasgrf <dig> ko mice and those exhibited by cdk <dig> ko mice  <cit> , p70s6k ko mice  <cit>  or pttg1ko mice  <cit>  is very striking, suggesting the possible joint participation of rasgrf <dig> and those different signaling molecules in the same ras-dependent signaling pathways  <cit> .

in order to better understand the role of ras signaling in pancreatic islet and beta cell function and to characterize the transcriptional changes underlying the phenotypic pancreatic alterations observed in our rasgrf <dig> ko mice, we aimed at characterizing the genomic expression profiles linked to the disappearance of rasgrf <dig> from pancreatic β cells in our ko mice. for this purpose, we used commercial oligonucleotide microarrays in order to carry out a detailed comparison between the genomic expression profiles of highly purified preparations of pancreatic islets isolated from our wild type  and knockout  rasgrf <dig> mice  <cit> . the data generated here supports the notion of significant functional roles of rasgrf <dig> in control of pancreatic islet signaling processes, as the absence of this rasgef was clearly linked to multiple transcriptomic alterations affecting genes whose products are known to be highly relevant for cellular signaling pathways of pancreatic beta cells involving ras/erk activation and intracellular calcium movement. in addition, our data also suggests that the functional role of rasgrf <dig> in pancreatic islets is mechanistically mediated, at least in part, by pttg <dig>  a known regulator of mitosis and gene expression.

RESULTS
differential gene expression in rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets
for a full characterization of the transcriptional profiles of purified islets from the pancreas of wild type and rasgrf <dig> ko mice, we first determined rasgrf <dig> mrna and protein expression levels in isolated mouse islets . thus, rt-pcr analysis of purified rna from wild type and rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets showed that rasgrf <dig> mrna is strongly expressed in wild type islets and, as expected, its expression was totally lost in the ko islets . furthermore, a similar rasgrf <dig> expression pattern was observed at the protein level, as western blot analysis of islet protein immunoprecipitates allowed detection of the full size 140 kda rasgrf <dig> protein band in wild type islets, which was completely absent in the rasgrf <dig> ko samples. interestingly, rasgrf <dig> expression was also observed in pancreatic islets and appeared to be slightly diminished upon rasgrf <dig> elimination . smaller-sized rasgrf <dig> protein forms that have been described elsewhere  <cit>  were not detected by this technique in our mice islets.figure  <dig>

ras signaling pathways have been shown to be important contributors to islet cell physiology in processes of regulation of cellular proliferation  <cit>  and response to prolactin  <cit> . to gain further insight into the molecular events occurring in islets modulated by rasgrf <dig>  we compared the genomic expression profiles of wild type and rasgrf <dig> ko islets. our preliminary studies indicated that minimal contamination of exocrine cells in our islet preparations would significantly bias data resulting from the microarray hybridizations and therefore we assessed an additional quantitative method to control the purity of islets samples as previously described  <cit> . thus, before use in microarray hybridizations, the specificity and purity of the rna preparations from islet cells used in our microarray hybridizations were tested by measuring the normalized signal ratios obtained in real-time pcr analyses of the total rna sample preparations with specific primer probes for insulin  and amylase , which indicated an enrichment of about  <dig> fold for our islet rna preparations in comparison to rna extracted from total pancreases .figure  <dig>

six independent microarray hybridizations were performed using total rna preps extracted from pancreatic islets of wt and rasgrf <dig> ko mice. global expression data were analyzed using rma  <cit>  as a tool allowing simultaneous background correction, multichip normalization and quantization of probeset expression signals in all separate microarray hybridizations. statistically significant gene expression changes occurring in rasgrf <dig> ko islets were identified using the sam algorithm  <cit> . in order to facilitate comparison of these data with our previous microarray analyses of other tissues of rasgrf <dig> ko mice  <cit>  and to get a manageable list of genes for further functional analysis, we set the false discovery rate   <cit>  value at  <dig> , which allowed identification of a total of  <dig> differentially expressed gene probesets  in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . a dendrogram generated by hierarchical clustering of all microarray hybridization data sets generated with all our wt and rasgrf <dig> ko samples  showed clear discrimination between the wt and the ko islet rnas as well as a generally opposite pattern of differential mrna expression between these two genotypes. in addition, functional annotation analysis identified significant enrichment of genes related to relevant biological functions in the horizontal clusters defined by the dendrogram . these observations indicate that the elimination of rasgrf <dig> in pancreatic islets produces significant transcriptional changes in a wide set of genes and suggesting a critical role for this gef in the regulation of specific pancreatic endocrine functions.

a detailed description of all the induced or repressed probesets detected in pancreatic islets is provided in table s <dig> , where the r-fold changes and statistical significance parameters relative to each of the  <dig> differentially expressed probesets are provided. overall, about half of differentially expressed loci  were downregulated, whereas the other half  were up-regulated in the mrna population of the rasgrf <dig> ko islets as compared to their wt control counterparts .

in view of the neuroendocrine nature of the hormone-making islet cells  <cit>  it was remarkable that the two genes showing highest levels of transcriptional repression  in our rasgrf <dig> ko islet samples  are gdpd <dig> , a locus functionally important in neural development and differentiation, and iapp , which is highly relevant for beta cell functionality. of note, iapp ko mice show increased insulin release and glucose elimination responses, a behavior completely opposed to that exhibited by our rasgrf1ko mice  <cit> , suggesting that iapp downregulation in pancreatic islets may be a compensatory mechanism triggered by the absence of rasgrf <dig> in our ko mice. interestingly, the gpdp <dig> gene is also found strongly repressed in the retina of rasgrf <dig> ko mice  <cit> , suggesting the occurrence of common regulatory mechanisms for regulation of gdpd <dig> expression by rasgrf <dig> in different cellular lineages or environments.

it should be noted that one of the  <dig> probesets  designed by affymetrix to recognize the rasgrf <dig> locus in the moe 430a commercial microarrays used in this study produced a surprising result, yielding significantly higher signals  when hybridized to rna from the rasgrf <dig> ko islets than after hybridization to their wt counterparts . using rt-pcr assays and specific primers we found out that this apparent contradiction is accounted for by the fact that the specific genomic sequence recognized by this probeset is localized within the 3-utr untranslated region of the rasgrf <dig> locus, a region that is not expressed in the wt samples but appears overexpressed in our ko mrna samples, possibly as a result of neomycin-cassette-dependent rna polymerase activity associated to the specific construct vector used to generate our ko mouse strain   <cit> . consistent with this, the lm5/lm <dig> pair of primers, designed to recognize the catalytic domain of rasgrf <dig>  produced significant amplification of a specific 276 bp band in the wt samples but not in the rasgrf <dig> ko samples . in contrast, primers ma1f/ma2r, designed to hybridize exclusively at the very end of the rasgrf <dig> 3′ utr region  yielded a 140 bp amplification product only in ko islet samples, but not in the wt samples . on the other hand, the combination of primers ma5f/ma2r, designed to amplify a region corresponding to the last two coding exons of rasgrf <dig> located downstream of the coding sequence recognized by probeset 1422600_at and upstream of the non-coding sequences recognized by probeset 1435614_x_at and primer ma2r , amplified a 334 bp dna fragment only in the wt samples, but not in the ko samples, showing that the mechanisms driving overexpression of the 3′utr in our ko samples did not involve expression of the neighboring, coding rasgrf <dig> region.

functional annotation and mechanistic implications of the transcriptional signature of rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets. alteration of components of ras/mapk and calcium signaling pathways
in order to try and unveil potentially relevant mechanistic and functional clues related to the specific transcriptional profile of rasgrf <dig> ko islet cells, we used functional annotation clustering software searching for co-occurrent annotations pinpointing specific subgroups within the list of differentially expressed genes identified in table s <dig> . thus, separate analysis of the subsets of induced and repressed loci listed in that table using the david software package  <cit> , identified a variety of go biological processes  and kegg signaling pathways  that could be ascribed with high statistical significance  to particular subgroups of repressed  or induced  genes of the rasgrf <dig> ko islets.

figure  <dig> summarizes data from tables s2a,b  and s3a,b  by quantitating the percentage distribution of the most abundant subgroups of induced or repressed genes that were functionally ascribable to various go bp categories  or kegg pathways  identified by david. as shown, the different go bp terms involving highest numbers of differentially expressed genes in the rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets  include a series of functional categories which are likely to be relevant for the functionality, development and/or proliferation of the specialized cell lineages composing the pancreatic islets. some of these categories  appeared to be more or less equally affected by differential gene induction or repression . in contrast, other functions, such as cell proliferation or gland development, involved significant higher numbers of downregulated genes than up-regulated genes in the transcriptome of the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . conversely, functional processes related to protein transport, rna splicing or protein metabolism implied significantly higher numbers of up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes in the transcriptome of the ko islets . the pattern of prevalent downregulation of genes related to cell proliferation and development appears to mirror the consistent defects of beta cell development and proliferation previously described in this rasgrf <dig> ko mice strain  <cit> . all in all, these transcriptional alterations are consistent with a significant functional role of rasgrf <dig> in control of development and homeostasis of the specific cell lineages present in pancreatic islets.figure  <dig> 
functional annotation analysis of differentially expressed genes in pancreatic islets of rasgrf <dig> ko mice. the david functional annotation tool  was used to identify statistically significant functional associations linking particular gene subsets contained within the list of repressed  or induced  loci occurring in rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets  to specific biological process categories  database, panel a) or signaling pathways . red: induction. blue: repression. percentage values were calculated by referring the number of genes in each individual subset to the total number of repressed  or induced  genes recognized by david within the list of differentially expressed genes listed in table s <dig> . the complete functional annotation analyses are described in tables s2a,b   and tables s3a,b  .



this notion is further supported by the david-based predictions of alterations in cellular  signaling pathways significant for islet functionality that are potentially caused by the differential gene expression occurring in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . in particular, multiple components of the cross-talking mapk signaling pathways and calcium signaling pathways were very significantly affected by differential gene expression, particularly by gene repression  in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . in addition, the hedgehog  and wnt  signaling pathways are also predicted to be significantly downregulated in our rasgrf <dig> ko islets  and it is possible that the predominant downregulation of the above mentioned pathways may also be related to the repression of regulatory components of the actin cytoskeleton also observed  in our rasgrf <dig> ko islets . in contrast, the components of signaling pathways relevant for ubiquitin mediated proteolysis  and cell cycle regulation  are predicted to be more significantly affected by up-regulation of gene expression in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . interestingly most of the above mentioned cellular signaling pathways are known to be susceptible of regulation by different ras-dependent signals and, specifically, rasgrf <dig> is a well-known mediator connecting calcium signaling and the ras-mapk pathway  <cit> .

focusing on individual repressed components of ras/mapk signaling pathways it was striking to observe the downregulation of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors including egfr, pdgfra and b, and fgfr <dig> and  <dig>  as well as many of their specific ligands  . of note in this regard, different studies have reported a positive paracrine/autocrine effect of fgf to promote beta cell proliferation and insulin secretion in pancreatic islets  <cit> , with fgf <dig> in particular significantly improving pancreatic cell function and beta cell survival through activation of mapk- and akt- mediated signals  <cit> . it is therefore likely that this downregulation of the fgf ligands and receptors underlies the diminished number and smaller size of pancreatic islets observed in the pancreas of rasgrf <dig> ko mice  <cit> . regarding mapk signaling, it was also striking to observe the downregulation of several gefs, such as rasgrf <dig>  sos <dig>  rasgrp <dig> and rasgrp <dig>  known for their ability to activate various ras family members in different cellular contexts. while the absence of ras-gef activity may also be related to the defective functionality of beta cells in pancreatic islets of rasgrf <dig> ko mice, these observations also confirm the absence of compensatory transcriptional activation of other gefs associated to the disappearance of rasgrf <dig> in those cells  <cit> . on the other hand, the possibility of mechanisms aimed at compensating at other levels the defective ras-mediated signaling of rasgrf <dig> ko islet cells, might be consistent with the observed overexpression of different gtpase family members including kras, rac <dig>  gna <dig> and multiple rab family members, as well as potential regulators and effectors thereof.

calcium metabolism is crucial for proper islet metabolism  <cit> , and the changes of expression in several important components in the regulation of calcium metabolism in rasgrf <dig> ko langerhans islets suggest a link with the metabolic alterations previously described by our laboratory  <cit> . in this regard, it was also particularly striking the observed repression of up to  <dig> different calcium channels, including cacng <dig>  cacng <dig>  cacng <dig>  cacng <dig>  cacnb <dig>  cacna1s, cacna2d <dig>  cacna1f in rasgrf <dig> ko islets .

finally, it was also very noticeable the dysregulation of the expression of multiple upstream components of the cascade of kinases involved in ras/mapk signaling pathways  . as an important number of the mitogen activated protein kinases have been related to jnk-dependent pathways  <cit> , it is possible that this dysregulation may be related to cellular stress caused by the absence of rasgrf <dig> to the beta cells of our rasgrf <dig> ko mice.

the expression of various phosphatases participating in ras/mapk signaling pathways was also found dysregulated in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . thus, whereas most differentially expressed ptpn isoforms were down-regulated, about half of the differentially expressed members of the dusp family  were down-regulated, and the other half were up-regulated in rasgrf <dig> ko islets . all differentially expressed isoforms of the ppm magnesium-dependent phosphatases were overexpressed in ko islets. on the other hand, whereas the calcineurin isoform ppp3cc was downregulated, the isoforms ppp3r <dig> and ppp3ca were overexpressed in the rasgrf <dig> deficient islets . calcineurin activity is likely to be relevant for pancreatic islet functionality as it has been reported to dephosphorylate and control localization and activity of nfat transcription factors in pancreatic beta cells  <cit> .

the transcriptional profile of phospholipase downstream effectors of ras/mapk signaling is also found significantly altered in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . interestingly, pla2g <dig> has been reported to protect beta cells from apoptosis via the generation of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin e <dig>  <cit>  and the repair of mitochondrial membrane peroxidation  <cit>  as well as modulating oscillations and transients of i in response to atp in these cells  <cit> . accordingly, overexpression of pla2g <dig> in the islets of our rasgrf <dig> ko mice would be consistent with our previous phenotypic characterization of reduced proliferation and unchanged apoptotic rates in beta cells of those animals  <cit> .

finally, several transcription factors known to act in ras/mapk signaling pathways were also significantly affected by differential gene expression in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets. in particular, atf <dig>  ddit <dig>  ets <dig> and jund  were up-regulated, whereas elk <dig>  rora, usf, nfatc <dig> and nfatc <dig>  were significantly repressed . as nfat/calcineurin signaling interactions  are very important for regulation of pancreatic beta-cell growth and function  <cit> , the observed differential expression of several nfat and calcineurin isoforms also points to significant alteration of related ras/mapk signals in our ras defective ko islets.

in summary, all these functional implications and mechanistic predictions derived from analysis of the transcriptional patterns in pancreatic islets of rasgrf <dig> ko animals are indicative of alterations of ras/mapk signaling pathways and calcium signaling, and are consistent with our previous characterization of pancreatic beta cell signaling phenotypes and preliminary, direct measurements of reduced erk responses and ca++ movements in isolated islets preparations of these ko mice  <cit> .

inferred regulatory mechanisms responsible for differential gene expression in rasgrf <dig> ko islets. potential role of pttg1
most genes showing differential expression in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets  appeared to undergo specific transcriptional modulation of their expression at this precise location by rasgrf <dig>  since a comparison of the microarray-based transcriptional profile of rasgrf <dig> ko islets  with those previously described at other tissue locations of the same rasgrf <dig> ko mice   <cit>  documented the occurrence of specific transcriptional patterns at each of those tissue locations. interestingly however, a limited number of transcripts showed consistently common patterns of differential expression  at two or more of those different tissue locations in our rasgrf <dig> ko mice . the fact that all those tissues share a common neuroectodermal origin suggests the possibility that the members of this gene group are parallely regulated loci playing a preferential, primary driver role in the mechanisms controlling the establishment of the overall mrna expression profile associated with the absence of rasgrf <dig> expression in those tissues.

remarkably, of all loci listed in table s <dig> , only pttg <dig> showed the same pattern of transcriptional alteration  in all different tissues analyzed in our rasgrf <dig> ko mice   <cit> . the repression of the pttg <dig> locus at the transcriptional level was also confirmed at the level of protein expression by means of wb assays  which also confirmed and validated the patterns of microarray-based differential expression identified in pancreatic islets for several other randomly selected, repressed or induced loci listed in table s <dig> . the consistent pattern of pttg <dig> repression observed in the variety of tissues mentioned above, suggests the existence of common, shared rasgrf1-sensitive mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the pttg <dig> locus in all those neuroectodermal tissue locations. the remarkable phenotypic similarities exhibited by pttg <dig> ko mice and our rasgrf <dig> ko mice are also consistent with this notion, and support the possibility of proximal functional or regulatory interactions between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig>  <cit> . although not all their phenotypes are exactly identical , the strong phenotypic similarities observed in both ko mice models  strongly suggest the possibility of interconnected regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> and/or functional proximity between these two proteins in signaling pathways of the pancreatic islets.figure  <dig>

on the other hand, knockout mice for iapp, another highly repressed locus in pancreatic islets , show increased insulin and glucose responses  <cit> , a behavior completely opposed to that exhibited by our rasgrf <dig> ko mice  <cit> , suggesting the possibility that iapp down-regulation might be a compensatory mechanism triggered by the absence of rasgrf <dig> in pancreatic islets and pointing to the possible existence of a wider, rasgrf1-dependent regulatory network involving transcriptional regulatory interactions modulating more genes than just pttg <dig>  this may be the case for the crb <dig>  locus in view of the observation of significant transcriptional repression of this locus in the retina  <cit>  of rasgrf <dig> ko mice and its simultaneous overexpression in the islets of the same animals  and the previous report in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, where a point mutation in crb <dig> that causes retinal degeneration, is linked to a strong reduction in the expression of pttg <dig> <cit> . the existence of a wider network of transcriptional regulation dependent upon the expression of rasgrf <dig> in various neouroectodermal cellular lineages or environments, is also consistent with the transcriptional behavior of two other loci – aldh7a <dig> and gdpbp <dig> – which are found simultaneously repressed in retinas and islets ,  <cit>  of our rasgrf <dig> ko mice.

based on the highly consistent repression of pttg <dig> detected in all neouroectodermal tissues analyzed in our rasgrf <dig> ko mice , in order to gain further mechanistic insights underlying the transcriptional observations mentioned above, we decided to carry out more-in-depth analyses of molecular or functional interactions between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> using  specific cell lines expressing these signaling molecules or  ko animals devoid of their expression, either singly or in a combination.

to start our search for potential mechanisms behind the regulation of pttg <dig> expression by rasgrf <dig>  we initially used tfsearch . furthermore, we also applied genecodis gene set enrichment analysis  <cit>  software to identify tfs potentially responsible for the patterns of repressed  or induced  genes identified by means of microarrays  in our rasgrf <dig> ko islets.table  <dig>

analysis of the relationship of transcription factors capable of binding to the pttg <dig> promoter with their differential gene expression in rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets. list of  <dig> transcription factors  with potential binding sites locatable in the promoter region of the mpttg <dig> locus as determined by tfsearch  analysis of a  <dig>  kbp region located 5′upstream of the transcription initiation site. tfs coincident with those identified by genecodis analysis as potentially responsible for the transcriptional profile of repressed  or induced  genes in the transcriptome of rasgrf1ko islets  are marked in bold. tfs whose expression is altered in the transcriptome of rasgrf <dig> ko islets  are marked with asterisks  or shown in italics .



interestingly, comparison of table  <dig> and s <dig>  uncovered very significant coincidences, as many tf from table  <dig> were also identified by genecodis as potentially responsible for differential expression of repressed or induced subsets of the transcriptome of ko islets . specifically, genecodis analysis of the pool of downregulated loci in pancreatic islets of rasgrf <dig> ko mice identified several distinct groups of repressed genes  that are known targets for transcriptional regulation by tf such as e <dig>  lef <dig>  maz, sp <dig>  nfat and ap <dig> at exceptionally high levels of statistical significance . in addition, several other subsets of repressed loci were also identified as specific targets for the tata, foxo <dig>  pax <dig>  ets <dig> or ap <dig> transcription factors at high levels of significance . similar genecodis analysis also identified, at very high levels of statistical significance , a number of distinct subsets of induced, overexpressed genes of the transcriptome of rasgrf <dig> ko islets that are recognized transcriptional targets of tf such as sp <dig>  lef <dig>  maz, elk <dig>  e4f <dig>  gabp, foxo <dig>  yy <dig>  myc, nfy or nfat . furthermore, consistent with a suggested pattern of positive and negative transcriptional regulation, the actual mrna levels quantitated with microarrays  for several of the transcription factors listed in table  <dig> were indeed significantly amplified  or reduced  in the transcriptome of pancreatic islets devoid of rasgrf <dig> protein .

of note, whereas many tfs with sequence recognition sites recognizable in the pttg <dig> promoter region  are known to be functionally linked to ras-mapk signaling pathways  . in addition, most of them , hnf <dig>  nkx <dig>  nrf <dig>  oct <dig>  sp <dig>  usf and yy1) have also been described in the literature to play, significant functional roles in pancreatic and beta cell physiology . thus, a potential mechanistic link between pttg <dig> and the altered, differential gene expression linked to ras-mapk signaling in rasgrf <dig> ko islets is suggested by the observation that several of the tf related to ras-mapk signaling and listed in table  <dig> because of the presence of sequence recognition sites in the promoter region of pttg <dig> , are also differentially expressed in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . likewise, a similar mechanistic link may be suggested for pttg <dig> and differential gene expression in pancreatic islets of rasgrf <dig> ko mice, as several of the main transcription factors and regulatory gene networks and interactions involved in pancreatic islet development and beta cell function  <cit>  present sequence recognition sites in the promoter region of pttg <dig> , hnf4a and nkx2- <dig>  table 1) and/or are also differentially expressed in the rasgrf <dig> ko islets . it is highly striking to observe that most of these tf and regulatory genes, which are likely to be functionally relevant for ras-mapk signaling and/or beta cell function, are overexpressed . this observation suggests the interesting hypothesis that their overexpression , hnf4a and nkx2-2) may represent a compensatory mechanism elicited in the developing pancreas in order to counterbalance the reduced number/size of the islets, and the hypoinsulinemia and reduced proliferation of beta cells exhibited by the rasgrf <dig> ko mice  <cit> .

in any event, to uncover potential functional interactions between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> and in order to ascertain the involvement in those processes of ras-erk or other signaling pathways dependent upon rasgrf <dig>  we aimed to study by means of reporter constructs the effect of rasgrf <dig> overexpression on pttg <dig> promoter.

rasgrf <dig> modulation of pttg <dig> promoter activity through cytosolic kinase-mediated signaling
in order to ascertain whether or not rasgrf <dig> exerts any type of direct or indirect control over pttg <dig> expression, we carried out luciferase assays analyzing the effect of different rasgrf <dig> expression levels as well as various agonist and inhibitors of rasgrf1-dependent signaling pathways in btc <dig> cells transfected with a reporter construct containing a  <dig>  kb fragment of the mpttg <dig> 5′untranslated region  <cit>  . we chose this cell line as particularly appropriate for this kind of studies as it is known to express rasgrf <dig> in basal conditions and is also derived from an insulinoma  <cit> , thus providing a cellular environment that is physiologically similar to the pancreatic beta cells of our animals.figure  <dig>

we observed that rasgrf <dig> overexpression achieved through transfection of a rasgrf <dig> construct in these cells  resulted in significant increase  of the mpttg <dig> promoter activity both under basal, unstimulated conditions or after stimulation with various agonists known for their ability to activate rasgrf1-dependent signaling,   <cit>  . interestingly, no significant changes could be detected when similar reporter assays were performed in other cell lines of different embryological origin which did not express rasgrf <dig> under basal conditions, such cos <dig> or 293 t , supporting the notion that the detected expression relationship between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> suggested by our microarray studies  may be linked to this particular cellular environment of pancreatic cells.

we also tested the effect of inhibitors of various cytosolic kinases in our reporter assays of transcriptional activity dependent upon the mpttg <dig> promoter region in btc <dig> cells . interestingly, of all inhibitors used, only the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig> significantly reduced  the transcriptional activity of the pttg <dig> promoter when compared to untreated controls, whereas no significant changes were detected in the assays involving pi3k  or jnk  inhibitors . it was apparent that the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor did not block completely the pttg <dig> promoter activity and therefore mek activity cannot be the sole intermediary accounting for the relation between rasgrf <dig> and the pttg <dig> promoter. however, we also observed that the reduction of pttg <dig> promoter activity caused by mek1/ <dig> blockade was significantly higher  in rasgrf1-overexpressing cells than in the cells transfected with vector alone  and that mek <dig> expression was significantly repressed in rasgrf <dig> ko islets . these observations suggest that, although other pathways may be involved, there is at least a partial contribution of rasgrf1-erk signaling to the control of pttg <dig> promoter activity in these cells and are consistent with a previous report associating partial repression of pttg1/securin gene expression to the inhibition of the ras/raf/erk pathway in hct <dig> cells  <cit> .

altogether, our previous microarray expression data  together with these reporter assays  suggest that neuroectodermic, rasgrf1-expressing, pancreatic islet β-cells determine a specific transcriptional microenvironment that includes specific transcriptional machinery/mechanisms of control of pttg <dig> expression by rasgrf <dig>  furthermore, our demonstration that the modulation of pttg <dig> expression by rasgrf <dig> is mediated by erk signaling in pancreatic cells is also consistent with previous similar observations in other cell types, such as the mcf <dig> and u <dig> breast cancer cell lines  <cit> .

phenotypic interplay between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in rasgrf1/pttg <dig> double knockout mice
in view of the above results and the phenotypic similarities exhibited by single rasgrf <dig> or pttg <dig> ko mice, we wished to further explore any potential functional overlapping or interactions occurring between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in the endocrine pancreas. for this purpose, we crossed our rasgrf <dig> ko mice  <cit>  with pttg <dig> null animals originated in s. melmed’s lab  <cit> . wt and double knockout  mice arising from these crosses were interbred for several generations to produce a homogeneous genetic background allowing meaningful functional comparisons between the different genotypes.

our initial analysis of the dko rasgrf1/pttg <dig> mice generated  documented that they were viable and fertile, and did not show any gross phenotypic differences in comparison to their single ko parental ancestors. in particular, their birth rates, lifespan and body weight were rather similar to those of single rasgrf <dig> or pttg <dig> ko mice  <cit> . interestingly, we observed that the body mass of the rasgrf1-pttg <dig> dko mice was significantly reduced  in both males and females at  <dig> and 10 months of age  as compared with their wt controls, but this reduction was quantitatively similar, and not stronger than that already previously described for individual rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> ko mice  <cit> . the observation that the simultaneous disappearance of rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> did not cause any additive or synergistic effects over the reduction of body mass previously described in the individual rasgrf <dig> or pttg <dig> ko mice may be consistent with the functional participation of these two proteins at different levels of the same cellular signaling pathways involved in controlling these body growth aspects. on the other hand, not all phenotypic aspects previously described for rasgrf <dig> or pttg <dig> ko are shared. thus, in spite of the association previously described between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in the mice retina  <cit> , no photoreception defects were observed in our single pttg <dig> ko animals .figure  <dig>

as some of the main phenotypic traits shared between single ko mice for the rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> loci included reduced body weight, hypoinsulinemia and defective β-cell development and glucose tolerance responses  <cit> , we also aimed at analyzing how the combination of both ko lineages affected these parameters in dko animals, in order to further characterize potential functional interactions between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in the cells of pancreatic islets. in particular, as a reduced number of pancreatic islets was previously reported in single rasgrf <dig> or pttg <dig> ko animals when compared to their control counterparts  <cit> , we wished to evaluate the effect of the simultaneous disruption of both proteins on both the number and size of pancreatic islets and their content of alpha and beta cells in dko mice. our analysis of collagenase-digested pancreases of 8 month-old animals of the four different genotypes on the same genetic background  showed that single rasgrf <dig> ko mice exhibited about 50% reduction in the islet number per organ in comparison to the wt controls, whereas the single pttg <dig> ko showed a dramatically higher reduction  and the dko rasgrf1/pttg <dig> did not show statistically significant quantitative differences of such islet count in comparison to the single pttg <dig> ko mice .figure  <dig>

in addition, specific immunostaining of the islets for glucagon-producing alpha cells and insulin-secreting beta cells documented that the observed reduction of the pancreatic islet pool in dko mice was much more significantly linked to a reduction of the beta cell compartment than the alpha cell compartment in the pancreatic islets of dko mice devoid of both rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> . these observations are consistent with, and confirm previous reports documenting a significant reduction of beta cell counts in the single ko rasgrf <dig> or pttg <dig> ko mice  <cit> .

although we have previously identified rasgrf <dig> as an important mediator of beta cell development and proliferation  <cit> , the much more drastic –decisive– quantitative effect of the absence of pttg <dig>  than rasgrf <dig>  on development of beta cells in the endocrine pancreas, suggests a closer proximity of pttg <dig> over rasgrf <dig> to the actual downstream mechanistic components of signaling pathways that control beta cell development and proliferation. this notion of rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> participating in the same signaling pathways, but rasgrf <dig> acting more distally than pttg <dig> to the final effectors of those pathways that are directly responsible for beta cell development would also be consistent with our previous observations that the rasgrf <dig> ko mice display a specific reduction of about 50% of pttg <dig> expression , as opposed to the total absence of pttg <dig> occurring in the pttg <dig> ko mice.

the preeminence of pttg <dig> over rasgrf <dig> regarding the generation of the above mentioned islet- and beta cell-related phenotypes is also supported by the results of our assays of insulin release response and glucose tolerance tests carried out after administration of a bolus of glucose to the dko mice . indeed, analysis of serum insulin in our ko animals confirmed that both the single rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> ko mice exhibited lower levels of serum insulin than their wt counterparts  <cit> , but the levels of individual pttg <dig> ko mice were already very low and similar to those of the dko mice and certainly lower than those of single rasgrf <dig> ko mice . parallel gtt assays  were also consistent with the insulin release assays, but did not show statistically significant differences between the behavior of the dko mice in comparison to the previously described behavior of the individual ko for rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> figure  <dig>

altogether, our results suggest that pttg <dig> is an important signaling molecule acting downstream of rasgrf <dig> in signal transduction pathways relevant for control of beta cell development and physiological responses dependent upon pancreatic islet function.

CONCLUSIONS
besides defective memory/learning and impaired eye vision abilities, rasgrf <dig> ko mice also exhibit a reduced body size linked to a “pancreatic” phenotype that includes significantly reduced number and size of pancreatic islets, diminished beta cell proliferation and neogenesis, and associated hypoinsulinemia and glucose intolerance, suggesting an essential role of rasgrf <dig> in beta cell development and function.

the remarkable similarities existing among the “pancreatic” phenotypes of our rasgrf <dig> ko mice and those independently described for cdk <dig> ko mice , p70s6k ko mice or pttg <dig> ko mice, suggest the possibility that rasgrf <dig> and the other three different signaling molecules may contribute functionally at different levels of the same ras-dependent signaling pathways acting in the islet cell lineages regulating pancreatic endocrine functions.

in order to try and ascertain the functional role of rasgrf <dig> in pancreatic islet and beta cell function, here we used commercial microarrays to characterize the specific transcriptional profile caused by the disappearance of rasgrf <dig> from the pancreatic islets of our rasgrf <dig> ko mice. our data uncovered differential expression of multiple genes coding for components/regulators of mapk- and calcium-signaling pathways in pancreatic islets, suggesting a relevant contribution of rasgrf <dig> to the control of endocrine functions of the different cell lineages present in pancreatic islets.

the transcriptional profile of pancreatic islets was significantly different from that of other neuroectodermal tissues  isolated from the same rasgrf <dig> ko mice but, remarkably, shared with all of them a common alteration involving the significant transcriptional repression of the pttg <dig> locus.

interestingly, analysis of the promoter region of mpttg <dig> identified specific recognition sites for numerous transcription factors which were also differentially expressed in the rasgrf <dig> ko pancreatic islets and are also known to be relevant for ras-mapk signaling as well as for pancreatic islet development and beta cell function. in addition, reporter luciferase assays in transfected btc <dig> insulinoma cells overexpressing rasgrf <dig> documented the ability of rasgrf <dig> to modulate pttg <dig> promoter activity through erk-dependent signals. furthermore, characterization of rasgrf1/pttg <dig> double ko mice generated in our laboratory showed that the combined knockout of both loci caused pancreatic phenotypic alterations which were quantitatively close to those of single pttg <dig> ko mice and much more prominent than those measured in single rasgrf <dig> ko mice.

our data supports the existence of close functional and regulatory links between rasgrf <dig> and pttg <dig> in the cell lineages of pancreatic islets, where rasgrf <dig> appears to be a critical signaling component acting upstream of pttg <dig> in pathways controlling beta cell development and function.
