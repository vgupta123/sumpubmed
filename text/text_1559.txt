BACKGROUND
cotton is a commercially important fibre crop and is used as a major source of natural textile fibre and cottonseed oil. among the four cultivated species, gossypium hirsutum represents over 95% of the cultivated cotton worldwide whereas the other three species, g. barbadense, g. arboreum and g. herbaceum together represent the remaining 5%. cotton fibres are single-celled seed trichomes that develop from the ovule epidermal cells. about 30% of the seed epidermal cells differentiate into spinnable fibres
 <cit> . cotton fibre development includes four distinct, but overlapping stages: initiation, elongation/primary cell wall  synthesis, secondary cell wall  synthesis and maturation. the fibre cell initiation usually occurs from 2–3 days before anthesis to 2–3 days post anthesis  and fibre cell elongation occurs up to  <dig> dpa. however, fast elongation of fibre cell occurs between  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. secondary cell wall synthesis starts at about  <dig> dpa and continues up to  <dig> dpa. during this period large amount of cellulose  deposition takes place and the fibre cell wall becomes thick. in the final maturation stage  fibres undergo dehydration and produce mature cotton lint
 <cit> .

cotton fibre is considered as an excellent single-celled model system for studying the molecular mechanisms controlling the plant cell initiation, elongation and secondary cell wall biosynthesis. in recent years, functional genomics-based approaches have been widely used to investigate the genes involved in cotton fibre development
 <cit> . phytohormones such as ethylene
 <cit> , auxins
 <cit>  and brassinosteroids 
 <cit>  and transcription factors such as myb25
 <cit>  and myb25-like
 <cit>  were shown to be involved in fibre development. cotton fibre elongates by diffusion growth mechanism and the turgor driven force is required for unidirectional elongation
 <cit> . therefore, osmotically active solutes  and ion-transporters  play an important role in maintaining the osmotic potential of the elongating fibre cell
 <cit> . it is reported that the closure of plasmodesmata  and the coordinated up-regulation of potassium  and sugar transporters during fibre elongation stage maintains the turgor pressure required for the fibre cell elongation and the duration of pd closure correlates positively with the fibre length
 <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that ros  homeostasis is the central regulatory mechanism for cotton fibre initiation and differentiation
 <cit> . carbohydrate and energy metabolisms play an important role in the fibre development by providing the carbon skeletons for the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and fatty acids
 <cit> . several studies have shown the role of xyloglucan and pectin modifying enzymes
 <cit> , arabinogalactans
 <cit>  and expansins
 <cit>  in cell wall loosening and expansion during fibre elongation stage. further actin cytoskeleton plays an important role during fibre elongation stage and reorientation of cytoskeleton microtubules is required for the onset of secondary cell wall synthesis
 <cit> . despite extensive research on cotton fibre biology over the last few decades, the mechanisms controlling fibre development remain largely unknown.

the fuzzless-lintless  ovules of cotton mutant are ideal material for identifying genes involved in the fibre development through comparative approaches. a few comparative transcriptome and proteome studies were carried out to understand the genes involved in fibre initiation and differentiation using the ovules of fuzzless-lintless mutant and its wild-type
 <cit> . similarly, a comparative proteome study was carried out using ovules of fl mutant and its wild-type to identify the differentially expressed proteins at elongation stage
 <cit> . however, comprehensive transcriptome studies employing fuzzless-lintless mutants involving all the important stages  of fibre development are not yet reported.

in the present study, comparative transcriptome analysis of fl mutant with its wild-type , g. hirsutum l. cv. mcu <dig> at fibre initiation , elongation  and scw synthesis stage  was carried out using affymetrix cotton genechip genome array. data from this study suggests that stress responsive transcription factors and the genes involved in calcium  and phytohormone-mediated signalling pathways play a crucial regulatory role in fibre cell initiation and differentiation. our study also revealed the down-regulation of several genes involved in interconversion of sugar molecules and mitochondrial electron transport system  that are required for the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and fatty acids and maintenance of redox-homeostasis during fibre elongation. the comprehensive transcriptome analysis identified several stage specific genes and pathways operating during the fibre development that might be useful for the improvement of cotton fibre.

RESULTS
morphology of fuzzless-lintless mutant
the near isogenic fl mutant employed in this study is a spontaneous mutant of g. hirsutum l. cv. mcu <dig> first identified in 1984
 <cit>  and maintained as a pure fuzzless-lintless line in the germplasm collections at the cotton breeding station, tamil nadu agricultural university, coimbatore
 <cit> . morphological and growth parameters of the fl mutant including plant height, leaf size, flower colour, number of bolls per plant, number of seeds per boll, etc. are very similar to that of wt. scanning electron microscopy  study was carried out to identify the differences in early stages of fibre development by comparing the ovule of fl mutant with that of wt . sem analysis revealed the presence of fibre cell initials in the fl mutant, though very less in numbers as compared to wt. fibre initials could be seen two days before anthesis  in the wt and were more prominent at  <dig> dpa. similarly, the fibre initials were also observed on the fl mutant, though not very prominent at − <dig> dpa, but were more visible at  <dig> dpa . this suggests the probable delay of fibre initiation in the fl mutant. however, further growth of fibre initials were not observed in the fl mutant leading to its fuzzless-lintless status .

comparative transcriptome analysis
comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out at fibre initiation , elongation  and scw synthesis  stages using ovules of fl mutant and fibre-bearing ovules of wt to decipher molecular mechanisms involved in fibre cell development. affymetrix cotton genechip genome arrays were used for transcriptome analysis. transcripts with false discovery rate  adjusted p value ≤  <dig>  and fold change of  ≥  <dig>  were considered as differentially expressed transcripts  in the fl mutant as compared to their respective stages in wt . the number of down-regulated transcripts was more as compared to up-regulated transcripts in various stages analysed. further, the percentage of down-regulated transcripts was very high at fibre initiation  and early elongation  stages as compared to the later stages . data analysis revealed that majority of the dets showed stage specific expression pattern with minor overlap among the stages .

annotation and functional classification of dets
the dets were annotated based on tair proteome database . out of  <dig>  dets,  <dig>   were matched with arabidopsis gene models with e value ≤ e- <dig> . further, the dets were classified into different functional categories according to their putative functions based on mips functional catalogue . in categories such as “protein with binding function or cofactor requirement”, “response to biotic and abiotic stresses”, “transcription”, “cellular transport, transport facilities and transport routes” and “biogenesis of cellular components” the transcripts were mostly down-regulated at fibre initiation and early elongation stages . further, dets related to various transcription factor  families and phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways were identified using arabidopsis transcription factor  and hormone  databases, respectively . in addition, dets involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolisms, fatty acid metabolism, cell wall loosening and extension and scw synthesis were identified and discussed below .

 <dig> 

validation of microarray data
to validate the microarray data, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis was performed on  <dig> dets, belonging to various functional categories, during fibre development stages . the qrt-pcr analysis and microarray data showed similar gene expression pattern for all the genes studied .

differentially expressed transcription factors
dets encoding transcription factors  belonging to various families were identified in the fl mutant in all stages of ovule development as compared to wt . tfs belonging to the ap2-erebp, c2h <dig>  nac and wrky were highly down-regulated at fibre initiation  and early elongation stages  in the fl mutant. similarly, tfs belonging to the heat shock transcription factor  family were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant . further, several transcripts encoding myb family tfs were differentially expressed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. in addition, transcripts encoding integrase-type dna-binding superfamily proteins involved in defence mechanism were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa suggests their involvement in fibre development . transcripts encoding ap2-erebp family tfs such as ethylene responsive element binding factors , redox responsive transcription factor  <dig>  and dreb1-like  were highly down-regulated at fibre initiation  and elongation  stages in the fl mutant. in addition, transcripts encoding salt tolerance zinc finger  tfs belonging to c2h2-type zinc finger family and heat shock transcription factor  <dig>  were down-regulated at fibre initiation and elongation stages, respectively .

transcripts encoding r2r3-myb transcription factors such as ghmyb25/atmyb <dig> , atmyb <dig> and atmyb <dig> were down-regulated at fibre initiation and elongation stages. it has been shown that ghmyb <dig> <cit>  and ghmyb25like <cit>  are highly expressed during fibre initiation stage and have a role in regulation of fibre cell elongation and trichome development. atmyb <dig> has been shown to be involved in root growth of arabidopsis under drought stress
 <cit> . further, transcripts encoding nac family tfs were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa  and early elongation  stages. another stress responsive gene, multiprotein bridging factor 1c  was down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. it has been reported that mbf1c is involved in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance by activating ethylene-responsive signal transduction pathway
 <cit> . in addition to stress responsive tfs, transcripts encoding the homeodomain proteins such as /glabrous  <dig> and knotted1-like homeobox gene  <dig>  involved in arabidopsis trichome and root development, respectively were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa.

the developing fibre cell during initiation and elongation stages accumulate a large amount of solutes in order to maintain the required turgor pressure. expression of stress responsive factors during initiation and elongation stages suggests stress-like condition being generated due to turgor pressure. the stage specific transcriptome analysis showed the down-regulation of several stress responsive tfs in the fl mutant during the initiation and elongation stages as compared to wt. this could be due to the fact that these tfs may not have any role in the fl mutant as there is no further development of the fibre initials after  <dig> dpa. in contrast, our data showed the up-regulation of about 50% of the same tfs at much later stage  in the fl mutant . the down-regulation of stress responsive tfs in the initiation stage and up-regulation of the same factors at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant as opposed to wt suggests the loss of coordination among the regulatory mechanisms and the factors involved in the stress response in the mutant.

calcium and phytohormones-mediated signalling
calcium mediated signalling plays an important role in cell division and differentiation including root hair elongation
 <cit> . preferential expression of genes encoding calcium binding proteins involved in ca2+-mediated signalling pathways during fibre initiation and elongation stages have been reported in cotton
 <cit> . in this study, several transcripts coding for calcium-binding ef-hand family proteins were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant as compared to wt . in addition, transcripts encoding ca2+-dependent protein kinase  <dig>  and glutamate decarboxylase  were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, respectively. further, transcripts encoding ca2+-atpase that was shown to play a role in maintaining the calcium homeostasis in the cell
 <cit>   and c <dig> calcium-dependent membrane targeting protein were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant. these results are in agreement with the earlier reports that suggested a role for ca2+-mediated signal transduction and ca2+-homeostasis in the fibre cell initiation and elongation
 <cit> .

phytohormones play an important regulatory role in various plant growth and developmental processes through intracellular signalling events leading to well-defined changes in the gene expression. in the present study, dets involved in phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways were identified at different stages in the fl mutant as compared to their respective stages in wt . ethylene
 <cit> , auxin
 <cit>  and brassinosteroids 
 <cit>  were shown to play a role in fibre cell initiation and elongation. in this study genes involved in the phytohormone signal transduction pathways and the biosynthesis of auxin, br, ethylene, gibberellic acid , were found to be down-regulated at fibre initiation and elongation stages in the fl mutant .

while the transcripts encoding cytochrome p <dig> 83b <dig>  were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, the transcript encoding cyp79b <dig> was highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa. cyp79b <dig> catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime and cyp83b1/rnt1/sur <dig> catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates from indole-3-acetaldoxime and regulates the level of iaa. in addition, a transcript encoding the p-glycoprotein  <dig>  involved in auxin transport was down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant
 <cit> . furthermore, transcripts encoding the auxin responsive gene hypocotyls  <dig>   were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. also, auxin-induced in root cultures  <dig>  were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. transcripts encoding acc oxidases , involved in ethylene biosynthesis were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa  and  <dig> dpa  in the fl mutant. along with acc oxidases, a transcript encoding acc synthase  <dig>  which is a rate limiting enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis was also down-regulated at  <dig> dpa. these results suggest the down-regulation of auxin and ethylene biosynthesis at fibre initiation and early elongation stages in the fl mutant.

transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in br biosynthesis such as 3-oxo-5-α-steroid 4-dehydrogenase family protein 
 <cit>  and sterol methyltransferase  <dig>  were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant. in addition, a number of genes  involved in br signalling pathway
 <cit>  was also differentially expressed at various stages in the fl mutant as compared to wt . down-regulation of several genes involved in ethylene, auxin and br biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways during fibre initiation and elongation stages suggested their regulatory role in fibre cell initiation and elongation. in the present study we have identified a number of genes involved in the phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways that were down regulated at fibre initiation stage  in fl mutant as compared to wt. interestingly, ~50% of these genes were found to be up-regulated at late elongation stage  in the fl mutant , suggesting the delay in the phytohormone stimulation and signalling in the mutant.

carbohydrate and energy metabolism
sugars are the basic source of energy and carbon skeletons for all biomolecules and they are required for the regulation of cell homeostasis and synthesis of cell wall precursors. udp-d-glucose  is a central metabolite in carbohydrate metabolism and is the common precursor for synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides such as pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose. in the present study, transcripts encoding the enzymes, involved in synthesis of cell wall precursors, such as udp-glucose pyrophosphorylases , udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase , udp-d-glucuronate 4-epimerase  <dig> , udp-xyl synthase  <dig>  were down-regulated during fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant. ugp and ugd catalyse the formation of udp-d-glucose and udp-d-glucuronic acid, respectively whereas gae <dig>  and uxs <dig> catalyse the formation of udp-d-galacturonic acid  and udp-d-xylose  from udp-d-glucuronic acid, respectively . the udp-glucose formed from the sucrose by sucrose synthase  is used directly as a substrate by the cellulose synthase complex. the sus isoform c  involved in cellulose synthesis was highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant 
 <cit> . carbohydrates such as raffinose family oligosaccharides  are the main storage forms of carbohydrates in the seeds, which confer desiccation tolerance. in the present study, transcripts encoding galactinol synthase  that catalyse the first committed step in the biosynthesis of rfos  were highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant . further, raffinose synthase , stachyose synthase  were also down-regulated. trehalose is another storage carbohydrate that was shown to be involved in desiccation tolerance
 <cit> . transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in trehalose biosynthesis such as trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase  were down-regulated at fibre elongation stage. previously we have shown that, both gols and tps were highly up-regulated under drought stress at fibre elongation stage suggesting the role of these genes in fibre development
 <cit> .

in the present study, transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in calvin cycle such as ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa thus indicating the reduction of sugar pool in the fl mutant ovules . mitochondrial electron transport system  is the main pathway for the generation of atp by oxidative phosphorylation. recently it has been shown that the atp synthase δ <dig> subunit  is required for mitochondrial atp synthesis and to maintain higher atp⁄adp ratio which facilitates faster fibre cell elongation
 <cit> . several transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in mets were down-regulated in the fl mutant which in turn decreases the nad+/nadh ratio and efficiency of mitochondrial atp production . the atp/adp and nad+/nadh ratios are very critical for maintaining redox-homeostasis and functioning of several enzymes involved in synthesis of cell wall precursors and fatty acids
 <cit> . these data suggest the importance of interconversion of sugars and the role of mets during fibre elongation process.

fatty acid metabolism
fatty acid biosynthesis is another important biochemical pathway involved in fibre cell development
 <cit> . in the present study, transcripts encoding the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids , cuticular wax and phospholipids were down-regulated at fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant as compared to wt. calvin cycle and sugars exported from the cytosol are main source of sugar pool for synthesis of fatty acids in plastids of non-photosynthetic tissue. fatty acids synthesized within the plastids are exported as acyl-coa esters  to the endoplasmic reticulum  for synthesis of vlcfa that are precursors for synthesis of phospholipids, sphingolipids, wax and cuticular matrix . transcripts encoding the sugar transporters such as triose phosphate/phosphate translocator  and phosphoenolpyruvate /phosphate translocator  and acyl-coa binding protein  <dig>  were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant. glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator , tpt and ppt are required for import of cytosolic glc-6-p, 3-pga and pep respectively, from cytosol into the plastid for synthesis of acyl-coa
 <cit> . cytosolic acbp <dig> and acbp <dig> were shown to bind long-chain acyl-coas and involved in the trafficking of oleoyl-coa from the plastids to er for synthesis of vlcfas
 <cit> .

phospholipids are major structural components of plasma membrane  and involved in lipid signalling pathway. pm plays a crucial role during fibre cell elongation. phosphatidic acid  is the key component in phospholipid biosynthesis. the transcripts encoding acyltransferase-like protein  involved in synthesis of pa in er  and agc  kinase family proteins  were highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant. further, transcripts encoding fatty acid desaturases  such as fad <dig>  and fad <dig>  and delta- <dig> sphingolipid desaturase were down-regulated. in lipid-signalling pathway pa specifically binds to atpdk <dig>  and stimulates agc2- <dig> and it has been shown that agc2- <dig> knockout mutants resulted in reduced root hair length suggesting its role in cell elongation
 <cit> . down-regulation of genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and lipid signalling suggested their role in fibre development.

transcripts encoding beta-keto acyl-coa synthases  and beta-keto acyl reductase , catalyzing the first two committed steps in vlcfa synthesis, were highly down-regulated at fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant . in addition, a transcript encoding a long chain fatty acid elongation enzyme  was highly down-regulated at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa. a transcript encoding epoxide hydrolase involved in cutin layer biosynthesis was highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa
 <cit> .

lipid transfer proteins  are involved in transport of lipids from er to pm and the subsequent transport of lipids from pm to the cell exterior appears to be carried out by pm localized transporters such as atp-binding cassette  transporters
 <cit> . in the present study, several transcripts encoding ltps , abc transporters such as white/brown complex proteins  were down-regulated at fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant. further, a transcript encoding glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid protein transfer  <dig>  was down-regulated. high level expression of wbc <dig> during fibre elongation and plasma membrane localization was reported in upland cotton
 <cit> . in a. thaliana wbc12/cer <dig> and wbc <dig> have been shown to be involved in cuticular lipid transport
 <cit>  and the localization of ltpg in pm and its role in lipid deposition has been demonstrated
 <cit> . down-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism in the fl mutant particularly at elongation stage suggests the importance of these genes in fibre cell development.

transcripts involved in regulation of osmotic potential, ion-homeostasis and protein stabilization
cotton fibre elongates through diffuse growth mechanism and turgor-driven pressure is a significant driving force for cell enlargement
 <cit> . the turgor-driven pressure largely depends on accumulation of osmolytes and ion-homeostasis
 <cit> . further, genes involved in ros homeostasis and protein stabilization play a crucial role during fibre development
 <cit> . in the present study several transcripts involved in these processes were differentially expressed at various fibre development stages in the fl mutant as compared to wt. transcripts encoding the ion and sugar transporters  and membrane intrinsic proteins  were highly down-regulated during fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant . a transcript encoding skd <dig>  which is an aaa-type atpase family protein was highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant. the expression of mcskd <dig>  in elongating root tips and its role in endoplasmic reticulum-golgi mediated protein sorting machinery and k+ uptake has been demonstrated
 <cit> . further, transcripts encoding heat shock proteins  were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant.

primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis
several transcripts involved in the primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis were differentially expressed at various stages of fibre development in the fl mutant as compared to their respective stages in wt . a large number of genes involved in primary cell wall biosynthesis and elongation such as those coding for xyloglucanases, pectinases, expansins and arabinogalactans were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa. the role of xyloglucan modifying enzymes such as xyloglucan endotransglycosylases  and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases  has been well established in fibre cell development
 <cit> . in the present study, transcripts encoding touch  <dig> /xth <dig>  and xth23/xtr <dig> were highly down-regulated at initiation and elongation stages in the fl mutant. further, transcripts encoding endo-xyloglucan transferase/atxth <dig> involved in fibre elongation were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. these data suggested their role in primary cell wall synthesis and fibre development. pectins are major components of the primary cell wall and in cotton pectins constitute about 25% of the cell wall of cotton fibre. thus, pectin modifying enzymes play a major role in the fibre cell wall development
 <cit> . several transcripts encoding pectin modifying enzymes such as poly galacturonases , pectate lyases , pectin methyl esterases  and pectin methyl esterase inhibitors  were differentially expressed during fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant as compared to wt . further, large number of transcripts encoding glycosyl hydrolases and transferases were down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. particularly, transcripts encoding β-galactosidase  <dig>  and udp-glucosyl transferase 74b <dig>  were highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant. among the glycosyl hydrolases, galactosidases  catalyzes the removal of non-reducing β-d-galactosyl residues from β-d-galactosides. it is therefore thought that gals may be one of the main enzymes responsible for the metabolism of galactose rich polymers such as galactan and arabinogalactan and galactose containing side chains of cell wall polysaccharides
 <cit> .

expansins are highly expressed in cotton fibre tissue and play an important role in cell wall loosening during fibre elongation stage
 <cit> . a transcript  encoding α-expansin  <dig>  was highly down-regulated at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant . further, transcripts encoding expansin-like b <dig>  were highly down-regulated at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa and expansin-like α  were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa. these data suggest that both expansins and expansin-like genes play crucial role in fibre cell development. the transcripts encoding cellulose synthases were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa at which pcw synthesis ceases and cellulose synthesis begins . further, a transcript encoding endo- <dig> -β-glucanase was highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant . it was reported that the expression of endo- <dig> -β-glucanase, which is very low at the fibre elongation stage  and increases gradually during secondary cell wall formation in g. hirsutum , is involved in the degradation of callose and opening of the plasmodesmata during cellulose deposition
 <cit> . interestingly, a transcript encoding trichome birefringence  like  <dig>  gene was highly down-regulated at  <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa. recently, it has been shown that tbl genes are involved in secondary cell wall synthesis by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers and increasing the crystalline cellulose in arabidopsis <cit> . along with the cell wall modifying enzymes, several transcripts encoding structural proteins such as agps , flas  and proline-rich proteins  were down-regulated at fibre elongation and scw synthesis stages in the fl mutant .

actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in fibre elongation and onset of secondary cell wall deposition
 <cit> . tubulins  are major components of cytoskeleton microtubules and play a vital role in cell expansion by controlling the orientation of cellulose microfibrils
 <cit> . in the present study, transcripts encoding actins , profilin, atp binding microtubule motor family proteins, actin depolymerizing factor  and xu- <dig> beta-tubulin <dig> were down-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the fl mutant . the down-regulation of several genes involved in cell wall loosening and elongation, structural reinforcement and cytoskeleton dynamics suggests their role in fibre development.

CONCLUSIONS
sem study indicated a delay in the initiation process of fibre cells on the epidermal layer of ovules in the fl mutant and elongation of these initials was completely stopped at about  <dig> dpa. transcriptome analysis revealed the differentially expressed transcripts at various fibre developmental stages  in the fl mutant as compared to their respective stages in the wild-type. the down-regulation of stress responsive tfs  and transcripts involved in the ca2+-mediated signal transduction and phytohormone  biosynthesis and signalling pathways at fibre initiation stage suggested their regulatory role in fibre cell initiation and differentiation. further, down-regulation of transcripts involved in the calvin cycle, synthesis of rfos , trehalose  and cell wall precursors and mitochondrial electron transport system at fibre elongation stage in the fl mutant suggested the reduction of overall sugar pool and significance of mitochondrial energy supply required for the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and to maintain redox-homeostasis. similarly, down-regulation of transcripts involved in the synthesis of vlcfas and phospholipids and lipid transport suggests the reduced fatty acid metabolism in the fl mutant. this study also supports the earlier findings on the role of pectin and xyloglucan modifying enzymes, expansins and arabinogalactans and cytoskeleton dynamics in the cell wall loosening and elongation process. also the delayed expression of genes involved in phytohormone signalling and stress responsive tfs identified in the present study suggests the lack of coordinated expression of regulatory mechanisms involved in fibre cell initiation and differentiation in fl mutant. on the whole, the comprehensive transcriptome analysis of gossypium hirsutum l. cv. mcu <dig> and its near isogenic fuzzless-lintless mutant revealed the stage specific involvement of several genes and pathways during fibre development.
