BACKGROUND
since its discovery in the early 1970s, long-term potentiation  and long-term depression  of synaptic transmission had been suggested to be crucial factors for activity-dependent changes in the strength of synaptic connections and efficiency of synaptic signal transduction  <cit> . despite the fact that the outcome of electrical pulse protocols in slice preparations can differ in several brain regions with respect to temporal aspects, duration and intensity of stimulation, some general key properties became apparent: electrical stimulation using high-frequency bursts of ≥  <dig> hz for several minutes usually results in ltp, which is mediated by glutamatergic synapses, e.g. n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors  <cit> . unlike ltp, ltd is induced by low-frequency  stimulation and results in a suppression of synaptic transmission as marked by a strengthening of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials .

accordingly, bidirectional synaptic modifications such as ltp and ltd are believed to be crucial mechanisms underlying learning-induced cortical plasticity. however, there is an on-going debate how synaptic plasticity links to systemically observable changes such as cortical map reorganization, and changes in behavior and perception. in human subjects, it is difficult to study the outcome of synaptic modifications on behavioral changes induced by stimuli that drive ltp or ltd-like processes in vivo. recently, evidence for the functional relevance of such stimulation protocols has been provided in human pain perception. high-frequency stimulation of cutaneous afferents of the proximal forearm resulted in a long-lasting increase in perceived pain to electrical test stimuli. on the other hand, low-frequency stimulation decreased the individual pain perception  <cit> .

in previous studies we took advantage of a stimulation protocol developed in our group that allows for full control of the spatio-temporal pattern of tactile stimuli. in this protocol, we stimulated the tip of the index finger with irregular, poisson-distributed trains with an average frequency of  <dig> hz , which led to improvement of tactile perceptual performance of the index finger in parallel to expansion of cortical representation of the fingers  <cit> . plastic changes in primary sensory cortical areas induced by tactile performance changes are typically characterized by substantial spatial selectivity that arises from the presence of well-ordered topographic maps. accordingly, limited generalization and transfer is taken as evidence for effects in early representations. peripheral tactile stimulation using irregular pulse trains seems to induce spatially selective changes in performance only on the stimulated index finger rather than a global increase in perceptual performance on non-stimulated fingers of the same hand or the index-finger of the contralateral hand  <cit> .

to evoke plastic processes in the cortical representations of the stimulated skin sites, in the present study we delivered regular trains of either high-frequency  or low-frequency  tactile stimuli to the tip of the index finger by means of small stimulation devices . we hypothesized that hfs leads to an improvement in 2-point discrimination whereas lfs impairs performance.

as an output measure we used tactile spatial 2-point discrimination performance as a marker for its perceptual relevance. here we demonstrate that brief periods  of intermittent high-frequency  and continuous low-frequency  protocols of tactile stimulation applied to the index-finger  of the right hand evokes significant and long-lasting changes in tactile discrimination behavior.

RESULTS
tactile high-frequency stimulation 
effect of large-field tactile hfs on discrimination thresholds of the right d2
during the four initial training sessions  all subjects achieved a stable baseline of discrimination performance on their right d <dig> as estimated by repeated measures anova with factor session  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; n = 14). after applying t-hfs for  <dig> minutes discrimination thresholds on the right d <dig> were reduced. discrimination thresholds were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm before t-hfs and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm after stimulation resulting in an average gain of tactile performance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  =  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; see fig.  <dig> and 2). linear correlation analysis  revealed no relation between baseline performance before stimulation was applied  and the individual gain in performance found after  <dig> min of t-hfs , indicating that baseline performance is not a predictor for perceptual changes evoked by t-hfs. however, the results demonstrate that tactile discrimination performance can be improved by a short time period of tactile hfs. analysis of the time course of the recovery of the t-hfs-induced changes demonstrated that the discrimination improvement did not recover to baseline conditions  <dig> hours after termination of stimulation indicating long-lasting alterations in the individual percept that outlasted the stimulation for  <dig> hours  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). re-testing one week after t-hfs revealed that discrimination thresholds recovered to conditions found prior to t-hfs  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; see fig. 2). calculation of d'prime corroborated the improvement of discrimination performance by showing an increase after t-hfs from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . values remained high  <dig> hours after stimulation  but returned to baseline after  <dig> week .

spatial specificity of large-field t-hfs-induced changes
in order to study the spatial selectivity of hfs-induced perceptual effects outside the stimulated d <dig>  we looked for alterations in tactile performance on all other fingers of the right hand . prior to t-hfs, post-hoc analysis corrected for multiple comparison  revealed significant differences in discrimination thresholds for the middle-finger  and ring-finger  in comparison to d <dig> . no statistical differences could be found between all other fingers.

apart from a lowering in discrimination thresholds on d <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  after t-hfs  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ), only little changes could be observed for all other fingers. we found alterations of thresholds of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the thumb ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the middle-finger ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the ring-finger  and of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the little-finger . according to rmanova, none of these changes were significant. these findings demonstrate a clear absence of effects on other fingers than the stimulated d <dig>  which indicates a substantial local specificity of the tactile hfs-induced changes .

effect of small-field tactile hfs on discrimination thresholds of the right d2
prior to small-field t-hfs, all subjects achieved a stable baseline performance  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; n = 5). stimulating the right index-finger  using  <dig> minutes of small-field t-hfs resulted in no comparable changes of tactile discrimination thresholds  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; n =  <dig>  see fig. 4).

tactile low-frequency stimulation 
effect of large-field tactile lfs on discrimination thresholds of the right d2
we assessed the outcome of large-field t-lfs on 2-point discrimination in  <dig> right-handed subjects. all subjects achieved a stable baseline performance, as estimated from repeated assessment of thresholds over  <dig> consecutive sessions  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , see fig.  <dig> and 5). under pre condition, discrimination thresholds were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for the right d <dig>  after  <dig> min of t-lfs, discrimination performance of the right d <dig> was impaired in all subjects as indicated by a significant increase in discrimination thresholds of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , see fig. 5). linear correlation analysis  revealed no significant relation between the individual performance before stimulation was applied  and the individual change in performance . analysis of the time course of stability of the effects revealed that discrimination thresholds recovered to baseline conditions  <dig> h after termination of t-lfs  f =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) implying that the t-lfs-induced impairment was less persistent than the improvement observed after t-hfs. additional measurements one week after lfs application showed that discrimination thresholds remained unchanged as compared to baseline conditions  f =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , see fig. 5). the decline of discrimination performance was confirmed by calculation of d'prime. we found a decrease after t-lfs from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . values returned to baseline  <dig> hours after stimulation  and remained stable after  <dig> week .

spatial specificity of large-field t-lfs-induced changes
similar to the experiments described for t-hfs, we explored whether besides d <dig> the other fingers of the right hand were also affected by t-lfs. baseline discrimination performance  on the right hand  before t-lfs did not differ from the subpopulation that was used to study the local specificity of t-hfs-induced changes except for d <dig> . in contrast to t-hfs, brief periods of t-lfs  resulted in changes of tactile discrimination thresholds not only on the right stimulated d <dig>  f =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ), but also on the adjacent finger d <dig>  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , see fig. 6). we found a change of thresholds of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the thumb , of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the middle-finger , of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the ring-finger  and of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  for the little-finger . with the exception of d <dig>  thresholds of the remaining fingers showed also some increase in thresholds, that were, however, not significant .

effect of small-field t-lfs on discrimination thresholds of the right d2
prior to small-field t-lfs, all subjects achieved a stable baseline performance  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; n = 5). moreover, baseline performance did not differ between the groups tested with either small-field t-lfs or small-field t-hfs  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). applying  <dig> minutes of small-field t-lfs resulted in no changes of tactile discrimination thresholds  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , see fig. 4).

discussion
the psychophysical results shown provide the first evidence for the effectiveness of t-hfs and t-lfs protocols to evoke tactile performance changes in human subjects. we found that brief periods of intermittent high-frequency tactile stimulation  applied to the skin of the right d <dig> induced a lowering of 2-point discrimination thresholds on that finger. most interestingly,  <dig> hrs after t-hfs 2-point discrimination thresholds on the right d <dig> were still lowered in comparison to baseline indicating that brief periods of t-hfs can induce relatively long-lasting perceptual changes. these changes were spatially very specific as we did not observe any changes on the neighboring fingers. in contrast to t-hfs,  <dig> minutes of continuous low-frequency stimulation  led to a decline in tactile discrimination performance on the right stimulated d <dig>  however, these changes were less lasting and recovered to baseline after  <dig> hours. t-lfs effects differed further in terms of spatial specificity. impaired tactile performance was also observed on the right middle-finger. a central finding was that for both t-lfs and t-hfs perceptual changes were dependent on the size of the stimulated skin area. no changes at all were observed when the area was very limited  implying the need for spatial summation.

peripheral tactile stimulation allows the systematic alteration of input statistics according to parameters such as stimulation frequency, duration, temporal structure and number of applied stimuli in order to study perceptual changes in the tactile domain  <cit> . for example, a peripheral tactile coactivation protocol as used in previous studies consisted of tactile stimuli that were presented at different interstimulus intervals from  <dig> to  <dig> ms in pseudorandomized order with a mean stimulation frequency of  <dig> hz to the tip of the index finger  <cit> . testing 2-point discrimination thresholds before and after  <dig> hours of coactivation revealed an improvement in tactile discrimination  <cit> . compared to the present study, a similar frequency specific dependency has been described for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  over si. for example, brief periods of high-frequency rtms applied over si significantly improved 2-point discrimination thresholds  <cit>  whereas  <dig> hz rtms impaired frequency discrimination  <cit> .

in the current study stimulation protocols used to elicit ltp and ltd in vivo and in vitro  <cit>  were adopted and applied in form of peripheral tactile stimulation. several lines of evidence strongly suggest that improvement in 2-point discrimination evoked by peripheral stimulation reflects ltp-like plasticity in si. first, the amount of improvement in 2-point discrimination correlates directly with the amount of map reorganisation in si  <cit> . secondly, its duration is in the order of 2– <dig> hours  <cit> . thirdly, the improvement of 2-point discrimination can be abolished by antagonists at the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  <cit> .

t-hfs and t-lfs differed from the standard coactivation protocol using irregular pulse trains with inter-pulse intervals between  <dig> and  <dig> ms with respect to regularity, duration, number of applied stimuli, instantaneous frequency and temporal structure. in the present study, both t-hfs and t-lfs were applied for a time period of  <dig> min resulting in a total number of  <dig> pulses in t-hfs and  <dig> pulses in t-lfs. in contrast, in the standard coactivation protocol described above, a reduction of the stimulation period to  <dig> min with approximately  <dig> tactile stimuli was not sufficient to drive plastic changes  <cit> . based on these findings, it is conceivable that in addition to frequency the temporal structure, but not the duration of stimulation determine the outcome of tactile behavioral changes.

in the present experiments, both high- and low-frequency tactile stimulation were applied in two forms that differed according to the size of the skin area stimulated and the amplitude of probe movement. because the amplitude of the small-field stimulation was higher than that of the large-field stimulation , a larger effect on discrimination might have been expected, which was, however, not the case. instead, the clear lack of effects evoked by small-field stimulation in both the t-hfs and t-lfs condition implies that certain spatial summation requirements need to be fulfilled in order to drive behavioral changes. because small-field stimulation is clearly above threshold for evoking distinct sensation felt by the subjects, it is reasonable to assume that stimulation of this type also activates neurons located in the finger representation of somatosensory cortex. however, because of its limited size this cortical activation is not sufficient to overcome the threshold mechanisms to initiate plastic processes.

in all cases the protocols we here employed were local, restricting stimulation to the tip of the index finger, which was effective to alter 2-point discrimination on the skin regions stimulated. therefore, another aim of the present study was to test whether tactile stimulation of the index finger also effects 2-point discrimination of the neighboring fingers. for t-hfs no changes could be detected on other than the stimulated finger which indicates a substantial spatial specificity with no transfer and spread on neighboring fingers. for t-lfs, the situation was quite different, as a significant impairment of threshold was not only observed for the stimulated index finger, but also for the middle finger. after t-lfs, thresholds were also higher for d <dig> and d <dig>  although these changes were not significant . accordingly, the suppressive effects of t-lfs were less local with substantial spread across neighboring finger. conceivably, locality and spread of plastic changes allow insight into connectivity pattern of cortical networks undergoing these changes. however, at present little is known how presumably ltp- or ltd-like processes have differential effects on the topography of cortical maps.

a number of studies have provided evidence according to which prolonged, but unattended stimulation is ineffective to drive plastic changes  <cit> . on the contrary, the observation that improvement in 2-point discrimination could be obtained using a passively applied stimulation protocol is in line with a recent study showing that perceptual changes occur even without awareness by repetitive exposure to stimuli that are below the threshold of visibility and that are irrelevant to the central task  <cit> . their findings as well as ours described here show that tactile performance improvements can occur not only under training conditions, but also in situations of passive tactile stimulation. we suggest that the key to tactile performance improvements is to boost stimulus related responses that are normally insufficient to drive plastic changes  <cit> . among these, factors such as attention and reinforcement might also play crucial roles.

the fact that in all cases under all conditions tested the discrimination thresholds on d <dig> remained unaffected can be taken as an argument against nonspecific side effects such as overstimulation, habituation, and alterations in local blood circulation or finger temperature. influences of this type seem also very unlikely to play a role because of the opposite direction of effects evoked by using different stimulation frequencies. also, systematic shifts in attention dependent of stimulation frequency would have likely impacted to similar extents the tactile performance of all fingers. according to recent unpublished data from our group, attending the coactivation stimuli during coactivation or being distracted from them had no effect on the overall outcome of coactivation. therefore, the differential effects in 2-point discrimination induced by tactile high- and low-frequency stimulation are unlikely to be mediated by attentional processes. interestingly, stimulation that effectively controls the timing of applied stimuli, as it is the case in peripheral tactile stimulation, might short cut the role of attention by producing the same conditions as attention, such as synchronous firing or increased probability of firing in specific temporal order among groups of neurons  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the reported changes in 2-point discrimination in human subjects induced by either t-hfs or t-lfs provided first evidence for the perceptual relevance of stimulation protocols resembling those used in cellular ltp and ltd studies. conceivably, further extension of these approaches will be beneficial for the understanding of possible mechanisms underlying tactile performance changes, and for developing novel strategies in neurorehabilitation.
