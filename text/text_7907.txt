BACKGROUND
mechanical stresses applied to the spinal cord can potentially induce profound and irreversible paresis, secondary to induced pathological changes such as dysfunction and loss of neurons, impairment of neuronal cell survival mechanisms and protein synthesis, neuronal cell necrosis and apoptosis  <cit> . examples of such mechanically induced spinal cord damage include not only spinal cord compression but distraction insult  <cit> ; however, it is likely that tensile stresses form an important part of many injuries of the spinal cord. the primary mechanical event, which may occur in less than a second, can initiate a cascade of molecular and cellular events such as changes in gene expression, which may then influence cell function over minutes to hours or a much longer period. for example, transient disruption of ca2+ homeostasis may be an early event in a series of aberrant signaling cascades that ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction or cell death. extended consequences of this molecular cascade include changes in gene expression levels that are necessary for cell recovery or cell death  <cit> .

changes in the expression of several immediate early response genes have been documented in various in vivo models of spinal cord injury using microarray analysis  <cit> . these included the up regulation of transcription factors, suggesting that the expression of many other genes is potentially regulated after traumatic insult. indeed, the differential and post-traumatic expression levels of several genes have been explored in vivo in an attempt to stabilize, both biologically and functionally, the spinal cord once injured  <cit> . however, these in vivo experimental settings for studying the response of neuronal systems to mechanical injury suffer from several disadvantages over in vitro experimentation. for example, mechanical stress can cause additional or unexpected tissue or cell reactions such as activation of resident inflammatory cells or invasion of foreign cells from the periphery  <cit> . the complexity of the in vivo situation may also result in a limited accessibility to specific areas of tissue or cell type of interest, preventing real-time and spatial measurement of biological or mechanical parameters  <cit> . thus, in vitro models of the spinal cord stimuli can be useful to gain a better understanding of the specific neuronal response to mechanical stress.

one approach to determine the pathophysiology of mechanical-stress-related spinal cord damage is to investigate the in vitro response of neuronal cells to loading. the use of neuronal cell culture models allows for better control of the extracellular environment, is relative easy to manipulate, and permits for repeated access to neural cells for specific analysis. the spinal cord and neurons are always subjected to mechanical stress including tensile stresses, during spine movement. longitudinal vertebral distraction and the physiological tension zone  <cit>  of the spinal cord are closely correlated each other when the spine is subjected to flexural positioning  <cit>  and excessive kyphosis in the thoracic vertebrae  <cit> . the flexercell strain unit  is a cell-stretching apparatus that allows application of cyclic tensile force to cultured cells. the system has been used to elucidate the mechanism of mechanical signaling in various types of cells  <cit> . in our previous study using this equipment  <cit> , we investigated the in vitro effects of cyclic tensile stress on cultured spinal cord cells, with a special focus on the expressions of neurotrophins and their receptor genes. the results of that study showed that the application of tensile stress increased the expression levels of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, trkb, p <dig> neurotrophin receptor , glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and caspase- <dig> mrnas in the acute phase, followed by increased lactate dehydogenase release and induction of necrotic cell death. these findings led us to investigate further the expression of several genes related to cell death in cultured spinal cord cells under cyclic tensile stress.

the present study was thus designed to examine further the molecular changes and gene expression profiles in cultured spinal cord cells using the above cell-stretching apparatus and dna microarray technology in order to provide a more complete picture of the changes in the expression of specific genes involved in neuronal response to cyclic tensile stress.

RESULTS
cyclic tensile stress induced spinal cord cell death
under the condition of 10% tensile strain  at a frequency of  <dig>  hz , the proportion of living green-stained spinal cord cells decreased in a time-dependent manner, whereas that of dead red-stained cells increased simultaneously. transmission electron microscopy  examination showed that all cells at  <dig> hours appeared viable, with large nuclei, and dotted with chromatin and an abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum. in contrast, in cultures subjected to a tensile stress of 10% strain at  <dig>  hz some cells appeared to show deformity of the nuclei and cytoplasm at  <dig> hours, and chromatin condensation and fragmentation were observed at  <dig> hours. these morphological changes were indicative of the start of apoptosis and progressed at  <dig> hours .

the cell survival rate of cultures under this cyclic strain as a proportion of that of non strained cultures decreased from  <dig> ± 24% at  <dig> hours to  <dig> ± 19% at  <dig> hours,  <dig> ± 15% at  <dig> hours,  <dig> ± 14% at  <dig> hours,  <dig> ± 9% at  <dig> hours, and  <dig> ± 11% at  <dig> hours . this decrease in cell survival became significant after  <dig> hours. figure 2b shows the cell survival rates as a % of that seen in cultures subjected to a designated standard tensile stress, i.e. 10% strain and  <dig>  hz, after  <dig> hours at the three different strain levels of 5%, 10%, and 15% and the two different strain rates of  <dig>  hz and  <dig> hz. the cell survival rate in cultures subjected to a 10% strain but at a frequency of  <dig> hz was significantly lower than that seen at this standard level. therefore, increasing the strain rate independently of the strain level was associated with increased spinal cord cell death. conversely, the cell survival rate in cultures subjected to a 15% strain level at a frequency of  <dig>  hz was also significantly lower than that seen at the standard level. therefore, increasing the strain level independently of the strain rate was also associated with increased spinal cord cell death. there was no clear evidence of additive effects of strain level with strain rate.

cluster analysis of gene expression profiles
there was altered expression of  <dig>  genes after the application of a cyclic tensile stress of 10% at  <dig>  hz. these  <dig>   <dig> genes were profiled using hierarchical cluster analysis, based on similarities among their expression patterns in a time course manner. accordingly, they were divided into  <dig> clusters . cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes, cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes, cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig>  genes, cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes, cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig> genes, and cluster  <dig> comprised  <dig>  genes. as shown, genes of clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated in a time-dependent manner under cyclic tensile stress, whereas those of cluster  <dig> were upregulated in a time-independent manner. genes of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were downregulated in a time-dependent manner under cyclic tensile stress during the  <dig> hours.

identification of upregulated genes through gene ontology  analysis
based on the results of clustering analysis, we tested the genes by all go terms within the biological process in each of the clusters 1- <dig>  and subsequently identified the upregulated genes related to cyclic tensile stress among clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the gene related to "apoptosis" belongs to cluster  <dig> significantly among the cluster 1- <dig> and the gene related to "response to stimulus" belonged to cluster  <dig> significantly among the cluster 1- <dig>  candidate genes related significantly to "apoptosis" among the terms of a biological process were  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig>  and those significantly related to "response to stimulus" were  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig>  these genes are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  including the relative signal intensity, which was expressed relative to that at  <dig> hours . forty-four genes related to "apoptosis" were expressed in the early phase , whereas  <dig> genes related to "response to stimulus" were expressed in the late phase .

identification of upregulated genes using kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  analysis
based on the results of the clustering analysis, we tested the genes by all kegg terms in clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> including those genes which were upregulated in a time-dependent manner under cyclic tensile stress. these pathways with p values <  <dig>  are listed in table  <dig>  four pathways were significantly included in cluster  <dig>   <dig> pathways in cluster  <dig>  and  <dig> pathways in cluster  <dig> 

*, listed pathways are all statistically significant . "total gene count" means the number of genes in each pathway, which have already been registered in kegg system, and "count" means the number of genes, which were expressed significantly in each pathway in this study.

gene-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  in mapk signaling pathway
in further examination of kegg analysis of cluster  <dig>  which included many of the upregulated genes, we found that the mapk signaling pathway contained  <dig> candidate genes among the  <dig> genes that were significantly upregulated. these genes were calcium channel voltage-dependent l type alpha 1f subunit , neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type  <dig> , fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig> , platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide , v-raf-leukemia viral oncogene  <dig> , guanine nucleotide binding protein  gamma  <dig> , dual specificity phosphatase  <dig> , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase  <dig> , mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> interacting protein  <dig> , heat shock protein  <dig> , growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible alpha , and dna-damage inducible transcript  <dig> . to confirm the expression of genes identified using the microarrays, these  <dig> genes were identified to test differential expression using real time rt-pcr analysis. the mrna expression levels of pdgfr, g <dig> was significantly increased from the mid period of application of cyclic tensile stress , while cacn, trka/b, fgfr, raf <dig>  mkp, hgk, jip <dig>  hsp <dig>  gad d <dig>  and gad d <dig> mrna expression levels increased during the late phase of cyclic tensile stress . in each case these significant upregulations in mrna expression levels was by at least 2-fold in comparison with the control levels at time  <dig> .


discussion
in vitro systems offer several advantages over in vivo systems in the analysis of cellular responses to their mechanical environment, including the precise specification of loading parameters , control of the extracellular environment , the relative ease and repeated access of the cells, and simplified administration of pharmacological compounds. by precisely controlling the loading conditions, the quantitative relationship between the severity of mechanical injury and response to the injury can be evaluated  <cit> . previous mechanical stimulation studies of neuronal cells using immortalized cell lines reported that the physiological strain conditions of neuronal cells are not as high as osteoblasts or skeletal muscle cells  <cit> . rat motoneurons stretched at 11% strain showed ischemic changes but no mechanical damage  <cit> , whereas at a 6% strain level there were no ischemic changes or mechanical damage  <cit> . pc <dig> cells were subjected to cyclic tensile strain levels ranging from  <dig> to 16% at strain frequencies of 1- <dig> hz as physiological mechanical conditions  <cit> . based on these reports and considering primary cultured spinal cord cells  <cit> , we selected the range of cyclic tensile stresses most appropriate to our culture system in the present study, and the cells were observed morphologically following application of various tensile strains levels  and strain frequencies  using the flexercell system. interestingly, we found a significant decrease in the cell survival rate  when cultures were subjected to either a cyclic tensile stress of 5% at  <dig> hz or 15% at  <dig>  hz, compared with a cyclic tensile stress at 10% at  <dig>  hz, which was taken as a control level. our results suggest that both the level of strain applied and frequency of its application influence cell viability. furthermore the results demonstrate that a higher strain level at a lower strain rate can have a similar effect as a lower strain level at a higher strain rate in neuron-rich spinal cord cells.

to understand the molecular mechanism of neuronal responses to cyclic tensile stress, dna microarray was employed to identify the specific gene expression patterns in cultured spinal cord cells, and the hierachical clustering algorithm was used in the analysis. consequently, we found that  <dig> genes related to "apoptosis" among cluster  <dig> included the majority of progressively upregulated genes by enrichment analysis using biological process in the go system. furthermore,  <dig> genes related to "response to stimulus" were also identified among those of cluster  <dig>  including most upregulated genes in the late phase after application of cyclic tensile stress. on the other hand, the kegg/pathway analysis identified different pathways in the upregulated genes in a time-dependent manner in the clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which had been identified via the go system.

a number of investigators have attempted to characterize or determine changes in specific genes and signaling pathways of direct mechanical stress or load using cells from diverse tissues and in vitro models of mechanical trauma. these systems are multifold and can be separated into detection, response, and modulation pathways  <cit> . a load stimulus is detected by a mechano-electrochemical sensory system, including mechanically sensitive ion channels  linked to the cytoskeleton  <cit> . the principle detection system is the matrix-integrin-mechanosensory protein complex-cytoskeleton machinery  <cit> . this system is linked to the kinase cascade  system, which provides amplification, diversity, selectivity, and modulation capabilities and contains focal adhesion kinase   <cit> . the src homology protein complex  and growth factor receptor binding adaptor protein linking receptor  link to the ras-raf signaling pathway, and these are regulated through fak. ras and gtpase activation regulates the activation of raf, mapk and extracellular regulated kinase   <cit> . activated erks enter the nucleus and upregulate the expression of various transcription factors  and activate nuclear binding proteins such as nf-κb  <cit> . specific regulation may occur at load response elements in promoters of certain genes such as platelet-derived growth factor   <cit> . the mechanically sensitive ion channel could also be a gap junction channel, which propagates a ca2+ wave from cell to cell after a mechanical signal is detected through a cell adhesion molecule .

it is clear that systems involved in evoking the response of neuronal cells to applied mechanical load are highly complex, which requires an expansive approach to their elucidation. our results in primary neuronal-rich culture have analyzed gene expression profiles using the affymatrix system and thereby have identified  <dig>  genes with altered expression as a result of applied cyclic tensile stress, many of which are consistent with previous studies. these data will be useful for future examination of how the effects of mechanical insult on the spinal cord, in particular, are regulated. signalling pathways that may be involved in this process can be modulated by molecules such as g proteins, kinase phosphorylation and activation, and kinase inhibitors or phosphatases  <cit> . indeed, the mapk kinase pathway was identified by kegg analysis of the alterations in gene expression seen in the mechanically loaded spinal cord cells. mapks are a family of related serine/threonine protein kinases that transduce several signals responsible for cell proliferation or cellular stress, and are also intracellular signaling systems that induce optimal stress responses. in general, mapk is activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues by mapkk, which is activated through phosphorylation by mapkkk. in kegg analysis, the mapk signaling pathway can be classified into three main groups  <cit> : the classical map pathway, the c-jun n-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase , the p <dig> mapk signaling pathway, and the erk pathway. in the present study, the mrna expression levels of pdgfr and g <dig> significantly increased during the mid period of cyclic tensile stress application, while cacn, raf <dig>  mkp, jip <dig>  hsp <dig>  gad d <dig>  and gad d <dig> mrna levels increased during the late phase of the cyclic tensile stress application. these genes, which were further identified by real time rt-pcr analysis, may play an important role in the response of spinal cord cells to neuronal injury. previous in vivo studies of spinal cord injuries using microarray have also demonstrated the participation of similar genes in acute phage after injury  <cit> . gene expression of trka/b, fgfr, pdgfr, and raf <dig> could facilitate neuronal survival, while gene expression of g <dig>  hsp <dig>  gad d <dig>  gad d <dig> could be involved in dna damage. further studies that target specific gene expression pathways will help determine their precise role in neuronal responses to mechanical load.

our study is perhaps the first to attempt investigating the expression of genes related to apoptotic cell death during the application of cyclic tensile stress to neuronal rich spinal cord cells; however, it has several limitations. these include  imperfect validity of microarray results, with a cv of 5-15% for quantitative signals  <cit> ;  the neuronal culture was not 100% pure , and embryonic cells were used, not adults cells; and  the lack of immunohistological or in situ hybridization data to identify the exact types of cells in which alterations in gene expression occurred. nevertheless, we believe that the present study might be the first to comprehensively profile changes in gene expression involved in neuronal responses to cyclic tensile stress in cultured spinal cord cells using dna microarray. this is a considerable improvement in examining the specific response of neuronal cells to mechanical load. considered together with our previous findings  <cit> , we can conclude that certain apoptosis-specific genes are activated in neuronal cell rich cultures during the application of cyclic tensile stress. the clinical relevance of tensile stress may specifically include the tethering effect with the developmental ascensus medullaris  <cit> , cervical myelopathy in association with kyphotic deformity  <cit> , and complicated spinal cord distraction injury. however, it is perhaps intuitive to consider that abnormal tensile stresses are involved in many mechanical insults of the spinal cord. thus, we believe that our study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of spinal cord damage in various disease entities. furthermore, the current study may help understand the response of neuronal cells to cyclic tensile stress and therapeutic issues related to the mechanically damaged spinal cord.

CONCLUSIONS
we have investigated the effects of cyclic tensile stresses on cultured spinal cord cells and demonstrate that cell death was induced depending on the level and duration of strain applied. furthermore, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of alterations in gene expression profiles that occur following this mechanical stress, and identified in particular an upregulation of members of the mapk pathway. knowledge of the specific response of neuronal cells to mechanical insult could be a potentially useful tool for molecular-based therapy for spinal cord injury.
