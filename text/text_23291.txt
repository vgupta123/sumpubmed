BACKGROUND
medicago sativa  is a perennial forage legume that is also a candidate low-input bioenergy crop due to its great yield potential and high energy value . however, in order to fully realize alfalfa’s potential, significant improvements to biomass yield and quality are needed to compete against high yielding grasses, such as switchgrass and miscanthus. recently, we overexpressed a precursor of mirna <dig>  in alfalfa, and this led to up to a 2-fold increase in biomass yield, delayed flowering time, enhanced cellulose content and reduced lignin, producing an overall improvement in biomass quality  <cit> . in addition, three squamosa-promoter binding protein-like  genes  were found to be downregulated via transcript cleavage by mir <dig> in alfalfa  <cit> . all spl proteins constitute a family of transcription factors which contain a highly conserved dna binding domain of  <dig> amino acids  with two zinc binding sites and a nuclear localization signal   <cit> . given the diversity of traits affected by overexpression of mir <dig> in alfalfa, it is critical to identify and characterize its downstream target genes, especially spl genes and genes that are regulated by spls, as well as understand the functions and behaviours of spl genes and their target genes by solidly linking each to one or more phenotypes exhibited by mir156oe plants.

mir <dig> and its spl target genes play crucial roles in regulating different aspects of plant growth and development . although some similarities are shared among the same clade of spl genes, many of the spl genes from the same clade possess different functions in different plant species. for example, atspl <dig>  atspl <dig>  and atspl <dig> are involved in controlling leaf shape, regulating shoot maturation and stimulating trichome production in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in addition, repression of atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> by mir <dig> is also required for heat stress memory  <cit> . atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> are involved in prolonging developmental transition and delaying flowering time  <cit> . atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> mainly promote shoot maturation, delayed flowering, increased anthocyanin accumulation, and sensitivity to stress treatment, as well as enhanced carotenoid accumulation in the seed . in rice , osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig> and osspl <dig> can increase anthocyanin accumulation and tiller number, and promote panicle branching and grain yield  <cit> . osspl <dig> controls rice grain size, shape and quality  <cit> . furthermore, a genomic organization study found that osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig>  osspl <dig> and osspl <dig> increase tiller numbers, delay flowering, reduce the number of spikelets and grains per panicle, as well as decrease secondary branches of panicles  <cit> . in maize, the spl homologue teosinte glume architecture <dig> can prolong developmental phase transition and delay flowering  <cit> . in potato , stspl <dig>  stspl <dig>  stspl <dig>  stspl <dig> and liguleless <dig> affect plant architecture and tuberization  <cit> . in lotus japonicus, mir156-targeted genes, spls and wd <dig>  can prolong developmental phase transition, delay flowering time and enhance shoot branching  <cit> . in switchgrass , pvspl <dig>  pvspl <dig>  pvspl <dig> and pvspl <dig> enhance shoot branching and increase biomass production and forage quality  <cit> .

in recent years, genome-wide global transcriptome analysis has become a powerful tool to uncover genes which control various traits in plants. for example, using transcriptome analysis, zhou et al.  discovered a candidate myb transcription factor responsible for red leaf coloration in peaches  <cit> . from the de novo assembled ipomoea nil  transcriptome, genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway were identified and ssr markers were developed for deployment in breeding programs  <cit> . transcriptome analysis of lotus corniculatus identified genes involved in secondary metabolism  <cit> . comparative transcriptome analysis of latex from two different rubber tree clones  revealed new cues for the regulation of latex regeneration and duration of latex flow  <cit> . similarly, in alfalfa, transcriptome analysis of resistant and susceptible alfalfa cultivars infected with root-knot nematode unveiled a number of differentially expressed common and cultivar-specific genes  <cit> . identification of candidate genes related to fall dormancy in dormant and non-dormant alfalfa cultivars was also accomplished by analyzing the leaf transcriptomes of these two cultivars  <cit> . the m. sativa gene index  <dig>  was used to investigate gene expression differences between m. sativa ssp. sativa  and m. sativa ssp. falcata   <cit> . so far, there has been no reported transcriptome analysis for mir156oe alfalfa plants; however, using microarray hybridization, xie et al. reported that the expression levels of  <dig> genes were affected in leaves of mir156oe rice   <cit> . thus, analysis of genome-wide changes in gene expression profiles in contrasting alfalfa cultivars should not only reveal differentially expressed genes, but also provide insights into possible molecular mechanisms that underlie various traits in mir156oe alfalfa plants. these include delayed flowering time, enhanced biomass production, and increased shoot branching  <cit> .

to illustrate changes in global gene expression induced by mir <dig> overexpression in alfalfa, we conducted rna sequencing  on two mir156oe alfalfa genotypes  generated in our previous study, and which showed reduced plant height and stem thickness; increased branching  and node numbers, as well as increased trichome density in leaves  <cit> . in addition, these plants showed delayed flowering time, a reduction in lignin content and an increase in cellulose content compared to wt control  <cit> . the present analysis investigates whether additional spl genes are targeted for transcript cleavage by mir <dig>  and what other genes are differentially expressed in mir156oe alfalfa plants.

RESULTS
a de novo assembled alfalfa transcriptome
in order to illustrate the role of mir <dig> in alfalfa plant development, wt and the two most prominent mir156oe genotypes a11a and a <dig>  <cit>  were selected for next generation sequencing at the transcriptome level to detect differentially expressed genes . since the full sequence of the alfalfa genome has not been reported yet, the de novo assembled alfalfa transcriptome was first obtained using all available hiseq data sequenced by our group. after filtering for low-quality and problematic reads such as empty adapters, short reads and unpaired reads,  <dig>  billion reads were assembled using the trinity transcriptome assembly program  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  transcripts ranging in size from 200 bp to 9673 bp were obtained  with an average length of  <dig>  bp and an n <dig> of 1406 bp . these represented  <dig>  trinity ‘genes’ with an average length of  <dig>  bp and an n <dig> of 1117 bp . the majority  of these genes were in the range of 200–999 bp .fig.  <dig> statistics summary of de novo assembly of medicago sativa transcriptome using the trinity program. a summary of de novo assembly of m. sativa transcriptome. b length distribution of de novo assembled transcripts



differentially expressed genes in mir156oe genotypes
as mir <dig> overexpression affects a number of traits in alfalfa plants  <cit> , we set out to identify degs that may be responsible for such traits. in total, relative to wt,  <dig>  genes were significantly affected in genotype a11a which was roughly twice that observed in genotype a <dig> which had  <dig>  degs  . of all degs,  <dig>   were differentially expressed in both genotypes . in order to narrow down the gene list, we focused on degs with at least a 2-fold change . there were  <dig>   and  <dig>   degs with a  <dig> fc for a11a and a <dig>  respectively, of which  <dig>  overlapped between the two genotypes . moreover, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  degs with at least a  <dig> fc in genotypes a11a and a <dig>  respectively, of which  <dig>  overlap between the two genotypes .fig.  <dig> numbers of differentially expressed genes  from rna-seq data between m. sativa wt control and mir156oe genotypes, a11a and a <dig>  using tophat-cufflinks analysis based on the m. truncatula genome. total number of genes detected with  significant  two-fold change  and  four-fc from leaves of wt control and mir156oe a11a and a <dig> in m. sativa. the overlapping gene numbers between the three different categories are shown in the venn diagrams. the blue and red arrows represent upregulation and downregulation, respectively



gene ontology  enrichment analysis of degs
gene ontology enrichment analysis was carried out to identify pathways that may be affected in mir156oe plants. combining all of the >2fc degs from genotypes a11a and a <dig>  approximately  <dig>  go terms were assigned . many of these go terms could reflect some traits affected by mir <dig> overexpression. of the  <dig> go terms in the molecular function category; nicotianamine synthase activity, ferredoxin-nad reductase activity, transcription regulatory region sequence-specific dna binding, folic acid binding, starch synthase activity, starch binding, sucrose-phosphate synthase activity, chitin binding and electron transporter   are of particular interest. for example, many transcription factors  which can bind specific dna sequences  <cit>  were found to be significantly down-regulated, and this is closely related to the term of transcription regulatory region sequence-specific dna binding. the go terms cellular component, thylakoid, thylakoid membrane and chromosome  may be related to photosynthesis, which could affect mir156oe traits, such as elevated biomass production, and influence biosynthesis of sugar, starch and lignin  <cit> . among the  <dig> functions classified as biological processes; response to water, sexual reproduction, flavonoid biosynthesis, sucrose transport, cellular copper ion homeostasis, and lignin catabolism  are the main interesting terms because they are related to the mir156oe traits such as delayed flowering time and effects on sugar, starch, lignin and cellulose contents  <cit> . the full list of the components for the three fractions  is shown in additional file 3: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> gene ontology  enrichment analysis of degs related to m. sativa development.  fractional distribution of differentially expressed go terms based on molecular function, cellular component and biological process. tree maps of  molecular function,  cellular component and  biological process of  <dig> fc deg go terms



validation of rna-seq data by quantitative real time pcr
to validate the rna-seq data, we randomly selected  <dig> genes  for expression analysis by quantitative real time pcr . all of the qrt-pcr primers were designed based on alfalfa transcripts which were assembled using the trinity program . the expression levels of the selected genes from the rna-seq analysis were compared to the qrt-pcr data in table  <dig>  in general, there was a strong correlation between the two sets of expression data. all genes selected for validation showed a similar expression trend  in the qrt-pcr and rna-seq analysis, and  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts  displayed a similar level of expression change . these results support a strong level of confidence in our rna-seq data.table  <dig> validation of rna-seq data using qrt-pcr



novel spl targets of mir <dig> in alfalfa
in addition to the three previously reported mir156-targeted spl genes in alfalfa  <cit> , our rna-seq analysis revealed four more significantly down-regulated spl genes in both mir156oe genotypes, namely msspl <dig>  msspl <dig>  msspl <dig>  and msspl <dig> , which are homologous to m. truncatula spl genes medtr8g <dig>  medtr2g <dig>  medtr4g <dig> and medtr7g <dig>  respectively. we further tested the expression patterns of the four spls by qrt-pcr and found that the transcript fold changes were consistent with those detected by rna-seq . similarly, rna-seq and qrt-pcr data showed that the previously reported msspl <dig> was also down-regulated in the mir156oe genotypes a11a and a <dig> . conversely, msspl <dig> and msspl <dig> were not detected with significant downregulation in the rna-seq analysis ; however, their significant down-regulation in a11a and a <dig> was detected using qrt-pcr . in summary, a total of seven spl genes are significantly down-regulated in mir156oe genotypes. these genes are thus potential targets for transcript cleavage by mir <dig> in alfalfa.fig.  <dig> validation of the mir <dig> targeted spl genes in mir156oe plants using qrt-pcr.  fold change comparison of transcript levels of seven spl genes between ngs results and qrt-pcr validation, “--” indicates the fc was not significant to be detected. the relative transcript level of the newly discovered spls  msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>  and  msspl <dig>  the relative transcript level of the previously established spls  msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>  and  msspl <dig>  relative gene transcript levels were analyzed using the 2-∆ct method. means of three independent biological repeats were used in this study. the student t test was used to analyze the significant differences of each tested gene between wt and mir156oe genotypes a <dig> and a <dig> 



to investigate whether mir <dig> directly targets the four newly discovered spl genes, we identified their predicted mir <dig> recognition sites using sequence alignment and used a modified 5’-race technique  <cit>  to test for transcript cleavage. among the twenty clones sequenced for each gene, transcript cleavage was detected in all four spls outside of their predicted mir <dig> target sites: 54 bp upstream in nine msspl <dig> clones , 42 bp downstream in sixteen msspl <dig> clones , 143 bp upstream in eleven clones and 130 bp upstream in one clone of msspl <dig> , and 350 bp upstream in seven msspl <dig> clones . we also found that each of the four spls has a predicted nuclear localization signal according to the online software prediction  .fig.  <dig> validation of the mir <dig> cleavage sites in msspl2/3/ <dig> and msspl <dig> transcripts and prediction of the nuclear localization signal. the predicted mir <dig> target sequence  was located in the 3’ untranslated region of  msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>  and  msspl <dig> and  the open reading frame region of msspl <dig>  cleavage sites are highlighted in green. denominators refer to the number of clones sequenced whereas the nominators represent the number of clones cleaved at a particular site. the nls prediction was carried out based on http://nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/cgi-bin/nls_mapper_form.cgi and the corresponding nucleotide sequence is indicated in red text




phylogeny of msspl genes in alfalfa
the conserved sbp domain was used to generate a phylogenetic tree for the spl gene family in m. sativa and its close relatives m. truncatula and glycine max, as well as the model plant arabidopsis. the spl genes can be grouped into eight main clades . clades i, ii and iii represent spl genes that are not targeted by mir <dig> , while genes from clades iv, v, vi, vii and viii can undergo cleavage by mir <dig>  the multitude of traits affected in alfalfa by mir <dig> overexpression could be explained by the fact that its spl targets, i.e. msspl2/3/ <dig>  msspl <dig>  msspl <dig>  msspl <dig> and msspl <dig>  belong to clades vi, iv, viii, v and vii, respectively . in silico analysis of the sbp domains that were used to generate our phylogenetic tree showed that six cysteines, four histidines, and eight arginines were absolutely conserved . the nucleotide sequence of the sbp domain is also shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of differentially expressed spl genes in mir156oe m. sativa plants. a phylogenetic tree based on an alignment of the sbp-box domain in spls from m. sativa, m. truncatula, arabidopsis, and glycine max. m. sativa spls  are highlighted with blue box. b a representation of the conserved amino acids in the sbp domain from the genes included in the phylogenetic tree. the height of the letter  at each position represents the degree of conservation



msmir <dig> is downregulated in mir156oe alfalfa plants
mir <dig> and mir <dig> signals are integrated at the spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> genes in the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . consistent with this finding, our rna-seq data revealed that the m. sativa mir <dig> precursor, msmir <dig> , was significantly downregulated in both mir156oe genotypes   relative to the wt control . in addition, three mir172-targeted genes homologous to medtr7g <dig>  medtr7g <dig> and medtr2g <dig>  which encode ap <dig> domain transcription factors  <cit> , were significantly downregulated in both a11a and a <dig> genotypes . whereas the msmir <dig> precursor was shown to be  <dig>  % identical to its m. truncatula homologue, the mature sequence was completely conserved .

tissue-specific expression of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir156-targeted spl genes in alfalfa
to gain an insight into how mir <dig> and its target genes are regulated in alfalfa, we evaluated the expression of mir <dig>  its target spl genes, and mir <dig> in four tissue types at different developmental time points from the juvenile stage  to just before flowering. expression analysis showed that mir <dig> was primarily expressed in the leaves, with the highest levels observed at the earliest time point, 10 days . in contrast, mir <dig> could be detected in all tissue types, except for roots, at 10 days, with the highest levels observed in stems, just before flowering, at 40 days . in general, msspl <dig> and msspl <dig> had an opposite expression pattern to mir <dig>  with the highest transcript levels observed in the leaves at 40 days . on the other hand, msspl <dig> , msspl <dig> , msspl <dig> , msspl <dig>  and msspl <dig>  had diverse expression profiles. for example, msspl <dig> was expressed most strongly in roots at 40 days.fig.  <dig> developmental and tissue-specific expression profiles of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir156-targeted spl genes in m. sativa. relative gene transcript levels of  mir <dig>   mir <dig>   msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>   msspl <dig>   msspl <dig> and  msspl <dig> were analyzed by the 2-∆ct method. means of three independent biological repeats were used to examine tissue-specific expression for each gene at  <dig>   <dig>  and 40 days compared to the 10-day time point 



altered expression of flowering pathway-related genes in mir156oe alfalfa
our rna-seq data revealed that several flowering-related genes, including leafy , flowering locus t , fruitfull , suppressor of overexpression of constans <dig>  and apetala <dig> , were down-regulated in the leaves of mir156oe genotypes relative to the wt control . transcript sequences of the aforementioned genes were obtained from our alfalfa de novo assembled transcriptome and then used to design qrt-pcr primers for gene expression analysis. all five genes were significantly downregulated in the mir156oe genotypes a11a and a <dig> relative to wt . since the above-mentioned flowering related genes are potentially regulated by spl genes, the upstream 2000 bp of their promoter sequences were screened to examine if they contain the “gtac” core sequence of spl binding element, which can be specifically recognized by sbp domain  <cit> . among these five genes, two of them, ley and ful, contain  <dig> and  <dig> “gtac” elements, respectively .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of potential downstream spl-target genes that affect flowering time in mir156oe alfalfa plants. relative transcript levels of  msft- <dig>   msft- <dig>   msful,  mssoc <dig> and  msap <dig>  and  mstcl <dig>  means of three independent biological repeats were used in this study. the student’s t test was used to analyze the significant differences of each of the tested genes between wt and mir156oe genotypes a11a and a <dig> 



discussion
we previously generated six alfalfa genotypes  with increased mir <dig> expression  <cit> . two of the genotypes, a <dig> and a11a , were chosen for rna-seq analysis. compared to wt, these two genotypes displayed the most pronounced phenotypes, such as increased number of main/lateral branches and nodes, decreased plant height and internode length as well as delayed flowering, but the extent of these phenotypic changes was different between these two genotypes  <cit> , presumably due to different mir <dig> levels. our transcriptomic analysis, showed that overexpression of mir <dig> can affect some similar categories of downstream genes; genes differentially expressed in both genotypes, and which may affect similar phenotypes, but different mir <dig> expression levels could also affect expression of some unique genes in each genotype, which may affect the degree of phenotypic change relative to wt control. therefore, it appears that diverse levels of mir <dig> expression may affect alfalfa traits differently.

genes that are commonly downregulated in both a <dig> and a11a genotypes include four additional mir156-targeted spl genes , in addition to the previously reported ones   <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> regulates  <dig> out of  <dig> arabidopsis spl genes that belong to the same clades as those silenced by mir <dig> in alfalfa  <cit> . in addition, in both alfalfa and arabidopsis, the msspl2/3/ <dig> and atspl3/4/ <dig> cleavage sites were found at the 3’utr, and that of msspl <dig> in the open reading frame region. however, unlike findings in arabidopsis  <cit> , cleavage sites for msspl2/3/ <dig> and msspl <dig> in alfalfa were not detected within the predicted mir <dig> target region. in alfalfa, the detected cleavage sites were located either upstream or downstream of the predicted target sites. this may be explained by the rna-induced silencing complex sliding through the transcript during mirna-directed cleavage of the target  <cit> . other studies have also shown similar results regarding cleavage site variation. for example, in a transcriptome-wide identification of mirna targets using a degradome sequencing approach, a lower percentage of cleavage sites was found at the expected sequences for some conserved mirnas in rice  <cit> . also, osspl <dig> was found to be cleaved by osmir <dig> beyond its target site  <cit> . although the cleavage sites for the newly discovered msspl <dig>  msspl <dig>  msspl <dig> and msspl <dig> in alfalfa are different from those in arabidopsis, these msspls belong to the same phylogenetic tree clades and share highly similar nucleotide and amino acid sequences with atspls , indicating these spls may perform similar functions in both alfalfa and arabidopsis.

based on the deg list, the go terms  are closely related to mir156oe alfalfa phenotypes, namely enhanced shoot branching, delayed flowering time and elevated biomass production  <cit> , which involve a large number of biological pathways. among the differentially expressed spl genes, we hypothesize that msspl2/3/ <dig>  may perform similar functions as atspl3/4/ <dig> in arabidopsis , because both of these two groups of spls are relatively small in size  and contain complementary sequences of mir <dig> in the 3’ utr. leaves of arabidopsis plants that overexpress atspl3/4/ <dig> can develop adult characteristics faster than wt control  <cit> . atspl3/4/ <dig> also functions by integrating signals from the autonomous photoperiod, age and gibberellic acid  pathways to redundantly promote the reproductive transition . under short day conditions, the three genes  are negatively regulated by mir <dig> in an age-dependent manner, and are positively regulated by soc <dig> through the ga pathway  <cit> . under long day conditions, however, soc <dig>  ft, and flowering locus d  positively regulate atspl3/4/ <dig> in leaves in response to photoperiod signals  <cit> . spl proteins are also known to indirectly activate ft expression through the direct binding of the inflorescence meristem gene ful, and directly activate transcription of ful, ap <dig>  and lfy in the shoot apical meristem of arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, the above-mentioned flowering pathway-related genes  were found to be significantly downregulated in mir156oe alfalfa plants , suggesting that certain flowering mechanisms regulated by spls may be common in both arabidopsis and alfalfa. in addition, some findings were also reported in snapdragon , where amsbp <dig>  an ortholog of atspl3/4/ <dig>  is involved in initiating flower development within the inflorescence  <cit> . silencing of amsbp <dig> eliminates flowering completely and causes an increase in vegetative branching under long day conditions  <cit> . on the other hand, mutations in the atspl3/4/ <dig> ortholog colorless non-ripening resulted in fruits that failed to ripen  <cit> , which may be considered as a novel function for spl genes  <cit> .

msspl <dig>  discovered in this study, to be regulated by mir <dig> in alfalfa, belongs to clade viii. this gene and its ortholog, atspl <dig>  play redundant roles in regulating vegetative phase change and reproductive transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . obvious phenotypes were observed in the double spl <dig> spl <dig> arabidopsis mutant with increased numbers of vegetative rosette leaves, rounder leaf shape and delayed flowering time compared to wt  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of atspl <dig> in hyponastic leaves <dig> mutants - which have lower mir <dig> expression - caused complete loss of the juvenile phase  <cit> . except for phase change, the plastochron length was also affected in the late flowering atspl9spl <dig> double mutants, suggesting dissociation between growth and development  <cit> . furthermore, genetic evidence indicates the involvement of atspl <dig> in petal trichome initiation via activation of trichomeless  <dig>  and anthocyanin pigment accumulation in vegetative stems  <cit> . this tcl <dig> gene was also significantly downregulated in our mir156oe alfalfa plants . in arabidopsis and patchouli , spl <dig> is involved in the regulation of sesquiterpene biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, our qrt-pcr results show that the sesquiterpene synthase gene was downregulated in mir156oe plants . atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> are two homologue genes in arabidopsis and their functions are redundant, however, only one orthologue of msspl <dig> was discovered in alfalfa . if this is the case, without the redundant homologous gene of msspl <dig>  there will be an obvious phenotype in msspl <dig> loss-of-function alfalfa genotypes. an ongoing project in our group is producing msspl <dig> overexpression as well as msspl <dig> loss-of-function alfalfa genotypes. by investigating these transgenic alfalfa genotypes, we will be able to determine if msspl <dig> also plays similar roles in regulating alfalfa vegetative phase change and reproductive transition, plastochron length, trichome development, anthocyanin pigment accumulation and sesquiterpene synthesis in alfalfa.

expression analysis revealed that the transcripts of most of the spl genes tested were detectable in roots. a recent publication reported that atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> were involved in the repression of lateral root growth, and that mir156/spls module participates in lateral root primordia progression  <cit> . this is consistent with our results, which showed relatively high spl transcript levels were detected in roots where mir <dig> transcript was undetectable.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this is the first report on the effect of mir <dig> overexpression on global gene expression in alfalfa. at least  <dig> genes were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold in mir156oe compared to wt alfalfa. gene ontology analysis showed that the types of genes that are significantly regulated in mir156oe genotypes are closely related to biological processes that can impact the phenotypes observed in mir156oe alfalfa, including enhanced shoot branching, increased trichome density, a delay in flowering time and elevated biomass production. the de novo assembled alfalfa transcriptome will add to the limited publicly available alfalfa genomics resources, and will allow for easier identification of alfalfa gene sequences. four additional spls  were discovered to be targeted for silencing by mir <dig> in alfalfa. based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, all the current detected spl genes in the mir156oe plants belong to five different clades, indicating that mir <dig> plays fundamental and multifunctional roles in regulating alfalfa plant development. it will be crucial to validate the functions of each spl gene belonging to different clades to more fully understand the functions of mir <dig> in determining alfalfa traits.
