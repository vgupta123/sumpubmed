BACKGROUND
breast cancer  is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease; hence, the effectiveness of a specific treatment greatly varies among bc patients. there have been several widely accepted methods to classify breast cancers into distinct subtypes , such as histopathological classification based on the morphological features, and analysis of the presence or absence of immunohistochemical  markers like er, pr and her <dig>  in addition, application of unbiased hierarchical clustering on gene expression assays has led to the identification of five distinct breast cancer mrna subtypes: luminal a, luminal b, her <dig> overexpression, basal-like and normal breast tissue-like  <cit> . the differences in gene expression patterns in these subtypes reflect the basic alterations in the cell biology of the tumor and are associated with significant variation in clinical outcome such as overall survival and disease free survival  <cit> . particularly, luminal a subtype patients are found to have relatively better prognosis while basal-like subtype patients having the worst prognosis. importantly, this molecular classification has successfully discovered sub-classes of er-positive and/or pr-positive breast cancers as luminal a and luminal b. this is a significant achievement because even though clinical assessment of ihc utilizes er, pr, and her <dig> status, these markers could not let the separation of these two distinct subtypes which have very different clinical outcomes  <cit> .

currently, the microarray-based bc classification has been regarded as the gold standard  <cit> . however, the main limitation of this method is its inability to assign samples consistently to specific molecular subtypes . a main reason is that the dynamic nature of gene expression within an individual may yield misleading results for classification. in contrast, gene mutations at dna level can be stably detected. as all cancers carry somatic mutations in their genomes and mutational heterogeneity widely exists in cancers, classification of cancers based on the mutation profile could be useful for cancer diagnosis and treatment. on the other hand, with the advancement of new sequencing technologies, genome sequencing has become affordable for routine diagnostic purposes. hence, exploration of cancer classification based on gene mutation profiles and incorporation of the classification into the clinical decision support system could be meaningful for personalized care of cancer patients.

several studies that integrated multiple types of molecular data for breast cancer clustering have been proposed. curtis et al.  <cit>  suggested a novel molecular stratification of breast cancer by combining genome and transcriptome assessments of  <dig> breast cancer patients. based on the impact of somatic copy number aberrations on the transcriptome, they revealed novel subgroups of breast cancers. likewise, ali et al.  <cit>  classified breast cancers into ten subtypes based on the integration of genomic  and transcriptomic  data. and in another study  <cit> , the authors proposed a computational method that combined gene expression and dna methylation data to implement machine learning aided classification of breast cancer patients. in a more recent study  <cit> , the authors proposed a network-based stratification method to classify cancers by combining somatic mutation profiles with gene interaction networks, and identified four subtypes of breast cancers.

it is often difficult to predict the impact of single nucleotide mutations in the genome at a molecular level and consequently their effect on cancer initiation and progression. in addition, somatic mutations are often sparsely distributed in different cancer samples. therefore, previous studies used somatic mutation data as an auxiliary information in combination with other data types to classify cancer and/or used as a binary entity   <cit> . this strategy is over simplified, given the fact that all mutations are not identical and their impact on the clinical outcome often broadly varies based on many factors such as the genomic location of mutations , perturbing the mrna transcription  or altering the amino acids  in the encoded proteins. hence, quantification of the deleterious impact of mutations on the gene function, and the use of this information in the mutation-based clustering scheme could yield meaningful results.

in this study, we developed a novel method to classify breast cancers based on the quantification of somatic mutation profiles. we analyzed the whole exome sequencing data from  <dig> ethnically similar bc patients in the cancer genome atlas  project. we first scored the functional impact of each variant using combined annotation–dependent depletion  scores  <cit> , and then clustered the  <dig> bc patients into three subgroups using the non-negative matrix factorization  method. furthermore, we investigated the biological implications of the classes that we discovered in this study. finally, we developed a computational model to predict the subgroup of the bc patients using supervised machine learning methods. the approach presented in this study exhibits a generic methodology that might be applied for classification of other cancer types.

RESULTS
data representation and challenges
our initial observation on the mutation score matrix showed that, the c-scores range from  <dig> to  <dig>  and distribution of scores for top ten variant genes can be seen in fig.  <dig>  comparison against the cosmic database shows that nine out of these ten genes  have evidence of abundant accumulation of somatic mutations in large population screens  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution of total mutational scores for the top ten variant genes. the top  <dig> most heavily mutated genes include several proven cancer associated genes including muc <dig> and obscn




somatic mutation profiles of bc patients exhibit a very sparse data form, unlike other data types such as gene expression or methylation in which nearly all genes or markers are assigned a quantitative value in all the patients. even clinically identical patients may share no more than a single mutation . therefore, this problem introduces too many zero valued entries to the main data structure . on the other hand, from machine learning perspective, having a limited number of patients  introduces a dimensionality challenge commonly known as the “curse of dimensionality” in machine learning. in this study, we are faced with this challenge as we observed the sample-to-feature ratio of 1: <dig>  in the main data structure.

in order to overcome the aforementioned challenges, generally there are two popular approaches, namely; feature extraction and feature selection. feature extraction transforms the current existing features into a lower dimensional space and widely used example methods include principal component analysis  and linear discriminant analysis , while feature selection selects a subset of features without applying any transformation. these methods increase the sample-to-feature ratio and decrease the sparseness hence making the clustering both feasible and more effective. in this study, we used feature selection by ranking the features  in decreasing order of their variance value and selected top n features for clustering . we optimized the size of n to be  <dig> genes in our clustering method.

classification of breast cancers based on somatic mutations
unsupervised clustering is the task of grouping a set of samples that have no label information, which results in grouping samples in such a way that samples in the same group are more similar in a specified measure to each other than to those in the other groups. there are several methods trying to achieve this goal such as k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering and expectation maximization  algorithms. however, these methods perform poorly or cannot come to a solution when applied to sparse data, as is the case in our study. therefore, we selected to use nmf because of its proven superior performance when tested on biological data based applications . nmf was introduced in its modern formulation by lee and seung  <cit>  as a method to decompose images.

as a factorization method, nmf algorithm takes our mutation score matrix as the input and decomposes it to two smaller matrices . the output coefficient matrix  is used to make sample cluster assignments. refer to methods for more details.

using the nmf clustering algorithm on our dataset, we stably clustered the samples into three groups using the top  <dig> genes, which have the highest variance values of mutation scores across all the samples. the three groups cluster  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> involve  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> patients, respectively. refer to methods section for more details.

in fig.  <dig>  we show a representation of the input data in the mutation score matrix, focusing only the top  <dig> variant genes for illustration purpose. as it can be seen, data represents a very sparse form  which makes most clustering approaches inapplicable. additional file 1: figure s <dig> and fig.  <dig> are the output matrices from decomposition of the mutation score matrix, which we input to nmf algorithm. note that multiplication of the two output matrices will approximately yield the input data. in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we see the basis matrix , which is not used in the scope of this study; however it could serve for clustering purpose of the genes. figure  <dig> displays the coefficient matrix , where the rows represent the metagenes that are a compact representation of all the genes, and columns represent the patients. we use this matrix to make sample to cluster associations by assigning the samples to the clusters where we observe the highest metagene value, i.e., the dark red color, .fig.  <dig> input matrix with c-scores of the top  <dig> mutated genes. the heat map shows the most heavily mutated  <dig> genes. the columns represent patients  and rows represent genes. one of the challenge of the dataset is being extremely sparse which can be seen in the heat map as most of the cells are colored very close to blue, which indicates a  <dig>  mutation score, with the exception of the first few columns. we identified that the main data structure is composed of 96 % zeros

fig.  <dig> coefficient matrix . the coefficient matrix ,  <dig> ×  <dig> in size, is used for assigning samples to clusters. the columns of the matrix represent patients and rows represent metagenes. we generated  <dig> metagenes that are used to cluster patients into  <dig> groups. the number of metagenes  is determined by running the algorithm iteratively over a range of biologically reasonable parameters as explained in methods section



figure  <dig> illustrates the stability of the clustering by displaying the consensus matrix, which was generated after  <dig> nmf runs using brunet’s  <cit>  approach . we used the silhouette score of consensus matrix to determine the optimum number of genes and clusters. in an ideal clustering case, we expect to observe values either close to  <dig> or  <dig>  indicating the probability of two samples being in the same cluster or not, respectively, which displays solid colored blocks. a value of one represents the highest probability that two samples are in the same cluster  and the value of zero denotes the opposite . in fig.  <dig> it can be seen that the dataset is clearly clustered into three distinct groups.fig.  <dig> consensus matrix. the consensus matrix is 358 ×  <dig> in size and illustrating the stability of the clustering. in ideal case, all the entries are expected to be either  <dig> or  <dig>  making solid colored blocks. the bar on top indicates the clinical stage of each patient. the silhouette score of this matrix is  <dig>  which indicates a very stable clustering.  =  <dig> )



characterization of discovered clusters
we investigate the clinical significance of discovered clusters by comparing the bc stage of the patients in each cluster. for this purpose, we analyze the distribution of patients according to their disease stage provided in the tcga data. we found that cluster  <dig> was dominated by early stage patients while cluster  <dig> had much higher proportion of late stage patients compared to cluster  <dig> . as can be seen in table  <dig>  the number distribution of patients in each cluster with stage ratio  for cluster <dig> is more than two-fold higher than that of cluster 3; hence here we call cluster  <dig> as the early-stage-enriched cluster, cluster  <dig> as the mixed cluster and cluster  <dig> as the late-stage-enriched cluster. this separation of patients by their disease stage indicates that our clustering method can successfully discriminate breast cancer patients by their disease stage using only the somatic mutational profiles of patients from their exome sequencing data.table  <dig> distribution of patients in the clusters discovered

next, we compared the somatic mutation profiles of patients between the early and late-stage-enriched clusters . we found that there were  <dig> genes, which have significantly higher mean mutation scores in the late-stage-enriched cluster  than in the early-stage-enriched cluster  , but none of the genes have significantly higher mean mutation scores in cluster  <dig> than in cluster  <dig>  this interesting finding indicates that these genes may have accumulated deleterious mutations leading to the progression of breast cancer into advanced disease states. we identified that tumor suppressor genes, apc, brca2; and oncogene, mll are among the  <dig> genes used in this comparison. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> most significant genes that are found to show significantly higher mutation rates in late-stage-enriched cluster.table  <dig> most significant  <dig> genes that show higher mutation rates in late-stage-enriched cluster 



we stratified the  <dig> genes into different gene families using the gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  tool as shown in table  <dig>  we observe that a significant proportion of the genes belong to transcription factor and protein kinase gene families, which are well known to be related to the progression of bc  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the assignment of these genes to functionally distinct gene families.table  <dig> gsea classification of  <dig> genes that have significantly higher mean mutation scores in cluster  <dig> compared to cluster 1

note that some of the genes in our gene list are not found in any gsea  gene family



network analysis of differentially mutated genes
we carried out the network analysis of the top  <dig> highly mutated genes  in the late-stage-enriched cluster compared to the early-stage-enriched cluster patients, to understand the functional relationship among these genes. the network in fig.  <dig>  generated using the ingenuity pathway analysis  program shows several interaction hubs, where the genes highlighted in purple color are highly mutated in the late stage cluster patients. most of the genes in our list interact with the central hub protein, ubc, which is expected because most of the proteins  are ubiquitinated before proteosomal degradation. it has been known that ubiquitin-proteasome system regulates the degradation of a number of cancer-associated genes  <cit> . apc  is another key tumor suppressor seen in this network that acts as an antagonist of the wnt signaling pathway, with a number of roles in cancer development and progression such as cell migration, adhesion, apoptosis, etc. the role of apc mutations in breast cancers has been well documented in the literature  <cit> . it is noteworthy to mention two transcriptional regulator genes in our list, notch <dig> and kmt2a . notch <dig> is a key regulator of akt, and its role is well documented in several cancers including in apoptosis, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition  pathway  <cit> . several somatic mutations in notch <dig> are also associated with different cancers in cosmic database  <cit> . mll is a transcriptional regulator and an oncogene with a variety of roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> interaction network analysis of the top  <dig> genes. the image shows the interactions of the top  <dig> genes with highest mutation load in the late-stage-enriched cluster compared to the early-stage-enriched cluster of patients



class prediction of breast cancers based on somatic mutations
using the aforementioned bc clusters, we labeled each sample with its assigned cluster, and developed a classification model to see how accurate we can predict clusters of unseen breast cancer patients based on their somatic mutations. with this model, we can predict the cluster of an unseen patient, using his/her mutation profile; hence we get insight about the patient’s clinical outcome, like bc stage. as an example; if the model predicts a new patient to be in the cluster <dig>  than we can expect this patient to be in late stage with certain genes be more likely to carry higher mutation loads.

we labeled each patient with its assigned cluster and tested five popular machine learning  algorithms; random forest   <cit> , support vector machine   <cit> , c <dig>   <cit> , naïve bayes  <cit> , and k-nearest neighbor  <cit>  to find the most appropriate algorithm for our dataset.

we used a 10-fold cross-validation for evaluation of classifier performances. in each loop of the 10-fold cross validation, after withdrawal of the test set, we did feature selection using the information gain feature selection method  <cit>  and selected the top  <dig> genes, which provide the highest information gain based on the training set. therefore, in total, we selected ten sets of  <dig> genes in the 10-fold cross validation. out of the aforementioned ml algorithms, we selected to further use the rf method in this study as it achieved the best 10-fold cross-validation accuracy with  <dig>  %. we believe that the sparseness of the data along with the low sample to feature ratio and difficulty of multiclass prediction are the reasons behind this moderate accuracy.

also we observe that svm algorithms achieved a very close accuracy but with a loss in tpr, fpr and f measure. and knn method yielded the worst accuracy of all the methods we used. table  <dig> shows the performance measures of each ml algorithm.table  <dig> 10-fold cross-validation performance results of five classifiers



figure  <dig> shows the receiver operating characteristic  curves for each class that illustrate the relationship between tpr  and fpr  for each class. in the perfect case, an roc curve goes straight up on the y-axis and then to the right parallel to the x-axis; thus maximizing the area under the curve . an auc close to one indicates that the classifier is predicting with maximum tp and minimum fp. we calculated the auc for clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that the classification model can better differentiate the late stage patients against the remaining patients.fig.  <dig> roc curves. the roc curve, which is used to show the accuracy of the predictions made by the model, shows the relationship between tpr  and fpr  for each class. as the auc values indicate that the prediction model achieves a better accuracy in discrimination of early-stage-enriched and late-stage-enriched classes with  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively



we also used a permutation test, by running the same class prediction procedure with rf on  <dig>  randomly labeled datasets and none of the 10-fold cross-validations gave us a better accuracy, yielding a very significant p-value  . this supports the robustness of our model and the predication accuracy.

CONCLUSIONS
breast cancers are highly heterogeneous diseases; therefore, accurate classification of bcs is an important step towards making accurate treatment decisions. next generation sequencing opens new venues to better understand the genomic background of bc. in this study, we developed a novel bc classification system that solely uses somatic mutational profiles of bc patients, generated by whole exome sequencing, to identify clinically differentiable subgroups together with a class prediction model.

we used the tcga breast cancer somatic mutation dataset including  <dig> patients and applied necessary filtration to the reported variations. following, we used nmf clustering method to discover subgroups in the dataset, which yielded  <dig> clustered groups of patients. we investigated the clinical significance of discovered clusters by comparing the bc stage of the patients in the clusters and found that there exists a significant separation of patients according to their disease stage; hence we named cluster  <dig> as early-stage-enriched and cluster  <dig> as late stage rich. then we compared the mean mutation scores of early and late-stage-enriched clusters and found that late-stage-enriched cluster patients carry a significantly higher rate of mutations in  <dig> genes. we also identified important networks, biological functions and pathways regulated by these genes. finally, we used rf classification algorithms to develop a classification model, to make cluster predictions for unknown bc patients hence can provide insights about the disease stage and significantly mutated genes.

in conclusion, this study demonstrates that clinically distinguishable breast cancer subtypes can be identified solely based on somatic mutation profile data from breast cancer patients. further, our classification model can be used to predict the unknown subtypes of breast cancers, given the somatic mutation profile of a patient. this generic methodology can also be applied to classify and predict other cancer types.
