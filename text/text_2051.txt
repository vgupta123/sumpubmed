BACKGROUND
several genes related to reproduction have shown higher rates of divergence than other genes in the genome  <cit> . this fast differentiation has been explained most often by positive selection mediated by sexual selection and/or sexual conflict  <cit> , though some have suggested relaxed selective constraints  <cit> . because these genes show high levels of divergence and may possibly be directly involved with reproductive isolation, some authors have suggested that such genes may be the best candidates to distinguish species that diverged recently and should actually be considered speciation genes  <cit> .

most evolutionary studies on genes related to sex differentiation have focused on a portion of those rapidly evolving genes involved in fertilization or male-female interaction and only a few on the genes responsible for sexual differentiation themselves. in diptera, transformer  and doublesex  are two of the main genes that control sexual differentiation that have been studied  <cit> . another important gene in the sex-determination cascade is fruitless , which controls the male courtship behavior by the establishment and development of a male-specific neuronal circuitry  <cit>  along with dsx  <cit> . its genomic organization is conserved in several lineages of insects  <cit>  being composed of four main regions: sex-specific domain, dimerization domain , connecting region and dna-binding domains   <cit>  . the fru gene is alternatively spliced in a sex-dependent way from the p <dig> promoter, where the female transcript translation is interrupted by the binding of tra/tra- <dig> complex, whereas the male product is functional  <cit> . in sex-specific transcripts the exon  makes the first domain whereas, in non-sex-specific transcripts the first domain is composed by the btb exons . depending on the species, the btb domain is formed by one or two exons . in the same way the connecting region is formed by two to four exons depending on the taxonomic group . finally, the dna-binding domain at the 3' end is composed of one of four different exons , selected by differential splicing  <cit> . in addition to the sex-specific transcripts, sex-nonspecific products are expressed by three different promoters  downstream to the exon s, which confers to fru a complex pattern of expression in different tissues and stages of the development  <cit>  .

considering that fru is one of the key elicitors of male courtship behavior, variation in its nucleotide sequence could be subjected to sexual selection and thus be involved in lineage isolation and differentiation. should this be the case, we would expect a pattern of rapid divergence in fru, especially in regions under positive selection. indeed, the comparison among different insect lineages shows that the n-terminal and the connecting region are the most divergent  <cit> , which has been hypothesized to be either a consequence of these regions not being essential for the proper function of fru protein, or because they would contain information for species-specific male courtship behavior  <cit> . although the hypothesis of species-specific signature was rejected by the rescue of fru function via ectopic expression  <cit> , a formal study of selection patterns on this gene has not yet been performed.

in this work we study patterns of genetic variability in fru in tephritid  species of the group fraterculus to contrast the hypotheses that the high divergence of the connecting region is due to a relaxed selective constraint or to positive selection over the region. these anastrepha species from the group fraterculus are generally identified by subtle differences in morphological traits, particularly the aculeus  <cit> , which limits the identification to females. the problem of identifying species in this group is further enhanced by the inherent plasticity of the aculeus  <cit>  and possible existence of many cryptic species in the group  <cit> . this problem has not been placated by the use of some molecular markers, such as mtcoi  <cit> , doublesex  <cit>  and transformer  <cit> , which have, in general, shown low phylogenetic resolution. therefore, even though we would like to test whether the gene fru would provide good genetic markers to discriminate species from the fraterculus group, notably a. fraterculus, a. sororcula and a. obliqua, we are mostly interested in determining the effects of selection in this region, which is non-trivial since we are contrasting species and populations that diverged recently, where the use of standard dn/ds methods  <cit>  has been shown to be problematic  <cit> . even though there is a plethora of neutrality tests already developed to detect departures from selection at the population level  <cit> , the majority perform frequency analyses per nucleotide  <cit> , and few have used haplotype information  <cit>  or the phylogenetic relationships  <cit>  as a framework to investigate patterns of departure from neutrality. here, we propose a test that uses such information to detect patterns of selection using population polymorphism data rather than fixed differences among lineages.

RESULTS
long-term evolutionary analyses and positive selection in fru
for the long-term evolutionary study of the fru connecting region, we amplified a region of  <dig> bp containing an  <dig> bp intron  and  <dig> bp of the first exon from the connecting region  from three closely related anastrepha species  . the selective pressures over the fru c <dig> exon were investigated by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous rates ratio. table  <dig> shows the parameters inferred for the null models m1a and ma as well as for the alternative ma model. the relaxed branch-site test rejected the null model of selective constraint  indicating that the foreground branch  diverged in this region by relaxed selective constraint or by positive selection . we contrasted the restricted ma versus ma models in the strict branch-site test to discriminate between the two hypotheses, and again the null model of selective constraint was rejected  in favor of the hypothesis that part of the c <dig> exon differentiated by positive selection.

using bayes empirical bayes we estimated that  <dig> sites were evolving under positive selection with posterior probability greater than  <dig>  . figure  <dig> shows that positively selected sites are concentrated in the 5' half of the c <dig> exon, and that selectively constrained sites predominates in the terminal portion of the exon. the investigation of selection on amino acid properties in treesaap analyses indicate that all  <dig> physicochemical properties examined showed significant departure from neutrality in the goodness-of-fit test, under a  <dig>  cutoff limit . nevertheless, only three properties had significantly positive z-scores under the radical changes categories : α-helical tendencies ; hydropathy  and molecular weight . the sliding window analysis in treesaap also indicates positive-destabilizing selection in the 5' end of c <dig> exon . these macroevolutionary contrasts indicate presence of positive selection at the 5' end of c <dig> exon, whereas there is purifying selection at the 3' end of this exon.

n = number of sequences; h = number of haplotypes; hd = haplotype diversity; s = number of polymorphic sites; sy = number of synonymous changes; nsy = number of nonsynonymous changes; sg = singletons; m <dig> = sites with more than three variants; π = nucleotide diversity; πs = synonymous nucleotide diversity; πa = nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity; θ = waterson's theta. sd = standard deviation.

we performed several neutrality tests on the populational data separated by species. the analyses on the exon of a. obliqua revealed that all tests were significantly negative, whereas only fay and wu's h and tajima's d were significantly negative for a. fraterculus and a. sororcula. on the other hand, when these tests were performed on the intron data, we only got significant departures from neutrality in a. obliqua for the tajima's d test and fay and wu's h and in a. fraterculus for the fay and wu's h test . we used statistical parsimony to establish haplotype networks for the c <dig> exon  and for the i <dig> intron . because these haplotype networks fail to indicate long branches separating the different species here studied, we also performed the neutrality tests combining all sequences in a single set. when we do so, all neutrality tests performed either on the intron or on the exon data are significantly negative .

the topology of the haplotype network was then used to compare the probability of survival through time of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations by estimating the number of haplotypes defined by each type of substitution. we observed  <dig> tip nonsynonymous mutations to  <dig> tip synonymous mutations, and  <dig> interior nonsynonymous to  <dig> synonymous mutations. the data from fru gene in anastrepha  indicate that, in spite of their smaller number, nonsynonymous mutations define, on average, haplotypes with higher frequencies than those defined by synonymous mutations. this is indicated by a significant two-tailed mann-whitney ranking test , in which we observe that nonsynonymous mutations have a mean rank of  <dig>  and mean number of derived haplotypes of  <dig> , whereas synonymous substitutions have a mean rank of  <dig>  and mean number of derived haplotypes of  <dig> .

discussion
positive selection in fru c <dig> exon
comparisons of fru sequences from insects of very distinct evolutionary lineages show that regardless of the high evolutionary conservation of the btb and dna-binding domains, the connecting region show high divergence across the different species studied  <cit> . these results are compatible with relaxed selective constraint on the latter portion of the gene or with divergence by positive selection. here we contrast these two hypotheses using both, population and species level data from three species of anastrepha to show that in all levels our data are better explained by positive selection acting on specific portions of the gene, rather than relaxed constraint in the connecting region .

the combination of the relaxed branch-site test   and the strict branch-site test  demonstrates that part of the differentiation in the connecting region c <dig> exon from fru between the background  and foreground  lineages is due to positive selection . a beb analysis detected at least  <dig> sites under positive selection,  <dig> of which were inserted in regions where positive-destabilizing selection was inferred by the mm <dig> analysis 

because the btb domain and the dna-binding domains are generally conserved while the connecting region is highly divergent, it was suggested that the connecting region would either play no important role in fru function or it would contain species-specific information. according to the first hypothesis, the higher divergence of the connecting region would be due to relaxed selective constraint or neutral evolution, whereas according to the second hypothesis its variation would be explained by adaptive selection. gailey et al.  <cit>  rejected this latter hypothesis because the transgenic expression of anopheles fru in d. melanogaster rescued the muscle of lawrence  development, a structure that is specified only by male frum protein, which would imply that relaxed selective constraint or neutral evolution should be invoked to explain its variation. however, our studies on selective pattern in fru c <dig> exon from connecting region show signals of adaptive evolution in this region.

the gene fru is the most complex in terms of genomic organization, when compared to the other main genes from sex-determination cascade . due to alternative splicing, fru may be expressed in at least four different male isoforms and four non-sex-specific isoforms  <cit>  . the combination of these isoforms is required for the correct development of some neuronal circuitry and connections necessary to control courtship and copulation behavior  <cit>  all these isoforms share four exons that are commonly expressed that include the btb region and the connecting region. we sequenced a large portion of the latter region, which may be postulated to help connecting the btb to the zinc fingers present at the end of each of the alternative spliced isoforms. the interactions among these isoforms and the involvement of fru proteins in features directly and indirectly subject to sexual selection offer opportunities for positive selection to occur over some segments of this gene. these several distinct aspects of sexual differentiation could be affected by the connecting region differently than the mol development, hence the rescue of the latter does not mean that other subtler aspects of the behavior effected by fru such as male courtship song  <cit> , response to sex-pheromones  <cit>  and female post-copulatory behavior  <cit> , would respond similarly. this pattern is akin to what has been described for some central genes in gene networks which are co-opted and assume new functions in different developmental contexts  <cit> . such patterns have been observed in several developmental genes, such as some hox genes, which affect basic pattern formation as well as wing and other appendages formation in arthropods  <cit> . it should be mentioned, though, that caution should be taken when considering sexual selection as a sole explanation for the positive selection here found, because fru also codes for non-sex-specific transcripts  <cit> , so it is possible that the signal of adaptive selection may be the result of selection over phenotypes not related to sexual behavior.

selective pattern in low divergence lineages of anastrepha
both dn/ds and mm <dig> analyses require that the differences among sequences represent fixed substitutions among very well defined lineages  <cit> . when dealing with data from recently diverged lineages, few fixed substitution are found among sequences, and consequently, the power of the tests to discriminate between positive and purifying selection is reduced  <cit> . additionally, recently diverged lineages, such as the species a. fraterculus, a. sororcula and a. obliqua here considered, may still segregate ancestral polymorphisms. for this reason, standard interpretation of dn/ds and mm <dig> statistics could lead to equivocal conclusions and other approaches are required.

our data cannot be subject to the mcdonnald-kreitman  <cit>  test since there is no fixed interspecific variation for any of the species considered. we may, however, use the same rationale of contrasting recent and old synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in the framework of the haplotype network. the mcdonnald-kreitman test considers two categories of contrasts, polymorphic and fixed, or recent and old, but there is more information available from the network, particularly the relative frequency of each mutation, which may be an indication of the relative age of a mutation  <cit> . in a neutrally evolving region, older mutations would tend to be in higher frequencies than new mutations  <cit> , that is why we performed a contrast between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations using a non-parametric mann-whitney test which investigated the pattern of differential survival between synonymous and nonsynonymous in evolutionary time . this mann-whitney test rejects the null hypothesis that synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations come from the same distribution, and indicates that nonsynonymous mutations survived longer than synonymous mutations . the excess of low-frequency variants could be explained by many other factor besides positive selection, such as population demographic change and background selection, however, only positive selection and very specific demographic scenarios are able to explain the excess of high frequency mutations  <cit> . then the excess of nonsynonymous mutations found in the fru c <dig> exon reveals the action of positive selection driving the increase in frequency of such mutations in the c <dig> exon. because this test is dependent on the topology of the haplotype network, which has been shown to vary due to stochastic processes  <cit> , we are currently evaluating the power of this test in different evolutionary scenarios using forward and reverse-time simulations, which will be the dealt with elsewhere.

the excess of high frequency mutations detected in the mann-whitney test was also detected by the significantly negative fay and wu's h which measures the frequency of high derived mutations . the tajima's d and the fu and li's d statistics were also significantly negative and indicate an excess of low frequency variants. the joint analysis of different neutrality tests allows for a better evaluation of the influence of selection over this region, since each one is sensitive to a particular aspect of the site frequency spectrum  <cit> . one evident signal of hitchhiking effect by positive selection is the excess of low and high frequency variants coexisting in the a population after many generations from the selective sweep  <cit> , while the expected pattern for purifying selection would be only the excess of low frequency variants. therefore, the joint analysis of these neutrality tests confirms that fru c <dig> exon from anastrepha shows signals of positive selection, if not in the region itself, in a closely linked region.

selective sweep in fru connecting region
the diversity indexes of the c <dig> exon are significantly lower than those of the i <dig> intron  , which would suggest that the intron has been evolving in a less constrained way. this is not surprising since it is expected that non-coding regions, such as introns, would evolve neutrally, though some introns have been described to evolve more conservatively than adjacent coding regions  <cit> . interestingly, when we partition the diversity estimates by species we observe a reduction in the diversity levels for the intron in a. obliqua, but not in the adjacent exon. in a. obliqua, π and θ values for the intron are three times lower than those estimated for a. fraterculus and a. sororcula  . even the haplotype diversity was twice smaller than the values for the other two species . if we consider that the intron has evolved neutrally, we would expect similar diversity levels for the three species. departures from these expectations would suggest that populations have experienced distinct demographic scenarios or different selection events have acted upon the intron or contiguous regions. because the reduction in intron diversity in a. obliqua was not observed in the contiguous connecting region, it is not likely that it was caused by a recent demographic event, otherwise it should have affected equally the genetic variation in the intron and the coding region  <cit> . on the other hand, a selective sweep would lead to a reduction in local genetic variation with increase in frequency of the few polymorphisms associated with the sweep, and depending on its intensity could lead to complete fixation in the region  <cit> . when only drift and mutation are contributing to the increase of the diversity after such reduction, it takes on average 4n generations for the diversity to reach fisher-wright equilibrium levels. if there is purifying selection it would take longer for the equilibrium to be reached, whereas when there is positive selection the favored alleles, or others linked to them, will rapidly recover their high allele frequencies. therefore, the existence of a previous selective sweep should have longer lasting effects on the genetic variation of neutral regions than on regions under positive selection. the similar genetic variability in the coding region of the three species, coupled with a reduction in the variation in a. obliqua intron, suggests a selective sweep in a. obliqua, from which the intron variation is still recovering, while the variation in the coding region, subjected to positive selection, has already recovered, or was never completely lost. this scenario is more likely if more than one site has been subject to positive selection at the same time  <cit> , as it seems to be the case here. the hypothesis of a recent selective sweep is also corroborated by a star-like haplotype network with an excess of rare haplotypes for the intron, and lower fay and wu's h estimates for the coding region than for the intron .

fru as species-specific marker
the lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms makes recently diverged species share alleles throughout their genome causing a conflict between gene tree and species tree for several genes or dna segments  <cit> . when only neutral markers are considered it is expected that most of the loci attain reciprocal monophyly only after 9ne generations from the speciation event  <cit> , which would take a long time if the species have large effective sizes. considering that anastrepha species from the fraterculus group have diverged recently  <cit>  and should have large effective population sizes, we expect that species in this group will still show high degree of shared ancestral polymorphisms throughout their genome, which has been suggested by previous studies using both mitochondrial and nuclear genes  <cit> . even though we did not observe strict reciprocal monophyly when using data from fru, most specimens of a. obliqua are separated from the other species by a branch with several mutations, mostly amino acid replacements. in fact, only five haplotypes of this branch belong to specimens that were diagnosed as a. fraterculus and four as a. sororcula . when studying genes directly involved in the species reproductive isolation, the ancestral polymorphisms associated with regions under selection would be wiped away at a faster rate, and consequently, one or both diverging groups would be fixed for species-specific variation at that gene before other genome regions  <cit> . multilocus studies of closely related species have reported extensive ancestral polymorphisms sharing, but exclusive variation in some genes related to reproductive traits such as pheromone production  <cit> , seminal proteins  <cit>  or spermatogenic function  <cit> . it is possible that the fast evolutionary rate in fru may explain, per se, its more accurate phylogenetic resolution in anastrepha species, but it may also be due to the fact that this gene is adaptively diverging, and has a role in determining courtship behavior, which could somehow affect reproductive isolation.

CONCLUSIONS
contrary to gailey et al.  <cit> , who had considered the high diversification of fru connecting region solely as a consequence of relaxed selective constraint, here we conclude that part of such diversification is due to positive selection. these conclusions are based not only on the comparison of distantly related taxa that show long-term divergence time, but also on recently diverged lineages and suggest that the episodes of adaptive evolution in fru may be related to sexual selection and/or conflict related to its involvement in male courtship behavior. because the findings of an association between fru variation and the isolation of a. obliqua may only be because they had occurred historically concurrently, we need a more detailed study that considers the entire fru gene, as well as its interaction with other genes from the sexual differentiation cascade in more species to better investigate the role of the fru gene in the differentiation of this group and others.
