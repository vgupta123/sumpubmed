BACKGROUND
filarial nematodes are arthropod borne parasitic worms that infect hundreds of millions of people throughout the tropics and sub-tropics and are responsible for a great deal of morbidity in humans and domestic animals. many filarial pathogens, such as the agents of lymphatic filariasis and river blindness, require a bacterial endosymbiont, wolbachia pipientis, to carry out their life cycle  <cit> . in these species, depletion of the endosymbiont causes defects in growth, molting and fertility, leading to the death of the worm  <cit> . other filarial species, some of which are very closely related to wolbachia-dependent sister taxa, are naturally wolbachia-free  <cit> . thus far, there are no discernable patterns in wolbachia distribution , and the reasons for this disparity are poorly understood. presumably, some genetic function must be missing or reduced in wolbachia-dependent worms in comparison to their wolbachia-free counterparts, forcing them to rely on the bacteria as an alternative source of vital gene products. the processes underpinning wolbachia-dependence are of biological and medical interest, as the wolbachia products required by the dependent worm may represent useful targets for novel anti-filarial chemotherapies.

wolbachia endobacteria and the eukaryotic mitochondria share many common features, including the intracellular lifestyle, obligatory mutualism, reduced genome size, vertical transmission, etc. these shared features, as well as their shared ancestry in the order rickettsiales  <cit> , lead us to hypothesize that wolbachia may contribute to energy metabolism in the filarial host. previous studies have shown that antibiotic-mediated wolbachia depletion leads to upregulation in genes related to energy metabolism, including mitochondrially encoded subunits of the respiratory chain  <cit> . this impact on host mitochondrial gene expression, and presumably energy production, suggests that wolbachia may serve as an alternative energy source or mitochondrial “supplement,” necessitating increased activity when the endosymbiont is removed. if so, differences in mitochondrial function may account for discrepancies in wolbachia status in the filarial lineage.

the mitochondrial genome  is particularly sensitive to evolutionary pressure exerted by the wolbachia infection. vertically-transmitted wolbachia are able to expand rapidly through insect populations due to the mechanisms of reproductive parasitism  <cit> . wolbachia and mitochondria are co-transmitted. thus, the mtdna of the first infected individual presumably expand concurrently with the wolbachia infection. such wolbachia-mitochondria “sweeps,” characterized by unusually low degrees of variation in the mtdna of infected populations, have been noted in many insect species  <cit> . a similar lack of mtdna diversity is seen in populations of dirofilaria immitis  in comparison to wolbachia-free, non-filarial nematodes  <cit> . a wolbachia-induced genetic bottleneck may have led to the fixation of different mtdna types among infected filarial species as compared to uninfected species.

the mtdna sequences of  <dig> species of filarial nematodes, onchocerca volvulus <cit> , d. immitis <cit> , brugia malayi <cit> , and setaria digitata <cit> , have been published. this report details the sequencing and analysis of the mtdna sequences of  <dig> more species: acanthocheilonema viteaechandlerella quiscali, loa loa, onchocerca flexuosa and wuchereria bancrofti. studies of the distribution of wolbachia within filarial nematodes have shown that the infection is prevalent among  <dig> of the  <dig> filarial subfamiles, the onchocercinae and the dirofilariinae  <cit> . agreement between the phylogenies of wolbachia and their filarial hosts suggests that wolbachia entered the filarial lineage prior to the diversification of these  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> species included in this study are members of the the onchocercinae and dirofilariinae. four of these, b. malayid. immitiso. volvulus and w. bancrofti, are wolbachia-dependent  <cit> . the other  <dig>  a. viteael. loa and o. flexuosa, are wolbachia-free  <cit> , presumably due to secondary loss of the endosymbiont  <cit> . conversely, c. quiscali and s. digitata are wolbachia-free and belong to subfamilies  that have not been shown to contain wolbachia-infected species, suggesting that these subfamilies split from the lineage prior to the introduction of wolbachia endobacteria  <cit> .

in light of the presumed impact of wolbachia on the host mitochondria, we hypothesized that the mtdnas of wolbachia-dependent filaria may differ in gene content, arrangement or sequence as compared to those found in wolbachia-free species whose ancestor may not have undergone a wolbachia-induced genetic bottleneck or evolved in the presence of an endobacterial partner capable of affecting host energy metabolism. the purpose of the reported study was to compare mtdna from wolbachia-dependent and independent filarial species in search of sequence level differences indicative of altered mitochondrial function. our analyses revealed no differences that could be attributed to wolbachia status. future studies will be required to discover subtler affects of wolbachia on the sequence or function of filarial nematode mitochondria.

RESULTS
gene content and organization
the mtdnas of  <dig> species of filarial nematodes were sequenced, annotated and deposited in genbank . genome length, at-richness and base composition of the  <dig> mtdnas are compared in table  <dig>  the newly sequenced mtdnas are similar in size and at content to those of other filarial species. so far, filarial mtdnas range in size from  <dig>  bp in o. volvulus to  <dig>  in s. digitata and range in at content from  <dig> % in o. volvulus to  <dig> % in c. quiscali <cit> .

information was taken from previous studies for b. malayi <cit> , d. immitis <cit> , o. volvulus <cit> , and s. digitata <cit> . information regarding the wolbachia status of species from various subfamilies is reported in  <cit> .

all  <dig> filarial mtdnas encode the same  <dig> proteins,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas with very short intergenic sequences . these genes are encoded in the same direction, a characteristic shared by most nematode mtdnas. synteny is perfectly preserved in all examined species with the exception of c. quiscali . in  <dig> of the  <dig> species,  <dig> trna genes  reside between the at-rich region and ndl <dig>  in c. quiscali, the trnamet gene is positioned between cox <dig> and the at-rich region apart from the main trna cluster, and the order of the other  <dig> trna genes is rearranged relative to other species. for a comparisons between the mtdna arrangement among filarial and other nematodes, see  <cit> .

protein-coding genes
twelve protein-coding genes were identified in each of the examined mtdnas. none of these contain premature stop codons or frameshift mutations. reverse transcription pcr reactions indicate that the predicted protein-coding genes were expressed at the rna level in all examined species .

filarial mtdnas are extremely thymine -rich ; therefore, it is not surprising that filarial mitochondria show a bias towards t-rich codons . the most frequently used codon in all species is ttt, which encodes phenylalanine and serves as an alternative start codon in certain instances . the start and stop codons used by each species are listed in table  <dig>  novel start codons include tgt for nd <dig> in w. bancrofti, tct for cytb in a. viteae, and cct for nd <dig> in o. flexuosa. termination codons include tag, taa, and the incomplete stop codon t, which is converted to taa upon addition 3’ poly tail.

information was taken from previous studies for b. malayi <cit> , d. immitis <cit> , o. volvulus <cit> , and s. digitata <cit> . information regarding the wolbachia status of species from various subfamilies is reported in  <cit> .

ribosomal and transfer rna genes
all species encode  <dig> rrna genes. in all species examined, the 12s rrna gene is positioned between ndl <dig> and nd <dig> while the 16s rrna gene is positioned between cox <dig> and nd <dig> . the exact boundaries of these genes have yet to be mapped in any filarial species.

all species also contain the same  <dig> trna genes. in the previously sequenced species,  <dig> of the  <dig> mitochondrial trnas share a common secondary structure in which the tΨc arm and variable loop are exchanged for a tv-replacement loop  <cit>  . conversely, the two trnaser genes contain a dhu replacement loop in exchange for the typical d arm   <cit> . the predicted mitochondrial trna structures of a. viteae followed this trend exactly, as did most of the trnas from the other examined species. however, our predictions indicate that trnaser <dig> and trnaasn in c. quiscali, trnalys and trnapro in l. loa, trnatrp in o. flexuosa and trnapro in w. bancrofti may contain both the tΨc and d loops . the same anticodons are used in all species with two exceptions. trnapro uses the anticodon agg in o. volvulusd. immitiss. digitata and o. flexuosa, while the anticodon tgg is used in other species, and trnaleu <dig> uses the anticodon taa in a. viteae while the anticodon tag is used in other species.

at rich region
the control, or at rich, region represents the largest non-coding region in filarial mtdnas, which are otherwise densely packed with tightly spaced or slightly overlapping protein-coding, trna and rrna genes. the at rich regions of the  <dig> sequenced filarial mtdnas range in size from  <dig> bp in w. bancrofti to  <dig> bp in s. digitata . in most species, this region is located between cox <dig> and trnaala. the unusual arrangement of trna genes in c. quiscali places its proposed  <dig> bp at rich region between the trnamet and trnaleu <dig> genes, leaving an additional  <dig> bp non-coding region between the cox <dig> and trnamet genes. the function of this secondary non-coding region is unknown.

phylogenetic analysis
a phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the nucleotide sequences of the  <dig> protein coding genes from the fully-sequenced filarial mtdnas . trees were left unrooted since the closest relatives of filarial nematodes with complete mtdna sequences  are still too divergent to allow for accurate alignment. overall, topology is similar to that of trees based on single mitochondrial genes  with improved statistical support  <cit> . as in the previous studies, our molecular phylogeny does not agree with the classical taxonomy of the filariae, as the dirofilariinae and onchocercinae appear as polyphyletic groups. in our tree, the lymphatic filariae cluster together, as do the genera onchocerca and dirofilaria. c. quiscali, which has not been included in previous analyses, is most closely related to the lymphatic filariae and l. loa. a. viteae and s. digitata are basal to the other species in our study. simpler neighbor joining trees were constructed for each individual gene . as in the tree based on concatenated protein coding sequences, clustering is never reflective of wolbachia status.

discussion
filarial nematodes are widespread parasites that infect all classes of vertebrates except fish  <cit> . many of these are of socioeconomic and medical importance. however, the mtdnas had only been sequenced from  <dig> filarial species  <cit> . in our study we characterized the mtdnas of  <dig> additional species and used the newly available sequences to compare the mtdna of wolbachia-dependent and independent filarial nematodes. initially, we hypothesized that there might be obvious differences in the mitochondrial genome sequences of wolbachia-dependent and independent species due to the evolutionary pressure exerted by a co-transmitted endosymbiont that may impact the energy balance of its host  <cit> . however, our data indicate that the mtdnas of filarial nematodes are, thus far, remarkably similar. no major differences in genome length, at content or codon usage were detected. all  <dig> species contain the standard  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas. differences in trna structure or anticodon usage are also minor and do not correlate to wolbachia status. in light of these findings, it seems that wolbachia has had little effect on the content of filarial mtdna.

in most filarial species, synteny was perfectly preserved. the rearrangement of  <dig> trna’s in c. quiscali probably reflects its evolutionary distance from the other species included in this study rather than its wolbachia-free status , as such rearrangements were not detected in other wolbachia-free species. it will be necessary to sequence the mtdnas of other members of the splendidofilariinae in order to determine whether this rearrangement is species-specific or typical of the entire subfamily. however, this minor alteration in gene order is unlikely to impact overall mitochondrial function.

if wolbachia infection had led to the fixation of certain mitochondrial types in an ancestral population, one might expect to see higher degrees of sequence identity between species that have come into contact with the endosymbiont  as compared to species that have not  <cit> . however, our phylogenetic analysis indicated that the level of sequence identity shared between mitochondrial protein-coding genes is independent of wolbachia status. if it is true that filarial species considered primitive based on classical taxonomy  were never associated with wolbachia, the similarity of their mtdnas to the others in this study makes it seem unlikely that wolbachia have had a significant impact on mtdna sequence. the lack of diversity in mtdna sequences could be taken as an indication that the initial infection and theoretical wolbachia-induced genetic bottleneck occurred in an ancestor of all filarial nematodes, but this is unlikely given the phylogenetic age of the filariae. of course, one must consider that this study was performed on the level of complete genes. in the future, it may be informative to compare smaller loci in wolbachia-dependent and independent species, as even single base changes are known to have profound effects on mitochondrial function  <cit> .

the fact that no sequence-level differences were observed between mitochondria from wolbachia-dependent and independent filarial species does not exclude the possibility that differences may exist in mitochondrial function or efficiency between these groups. of course, many of the genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and energy metabolism are encoded in the nuclear genome rather than the mitochondrial genome. because only one filarial genome has been published , we do not know if certain nuclear genes are missing or altered in wolbachia-dependent species relative to their wolbachia-independent counterparts.

even if there are no differences in the genes encoded by wolbachia-dependent and independent filarial worms, it is possible that variation in expression levels could lead to differences in mitochondrial output. expression levels may be partially dictated by the number of mitochondrial genomes present in each mitochondria or the density of mitochondria in a given organism. these factors are also variable. quantitative real-time pcr techniques could be used to assess expression; however, careful normalization would be necessary to ensure accurate results when comparing expression levels across multiple species and life cycle stages. this type of analysis will not be possible until better nuclear genome data is produced to provide appropriate control sequences.

mitochondria and wolbachia appear to share a common evolutionary story wherein bacteria of the rickettsial family were taken up and transformed over time into an obligate mutualist that provides products essential to the life of the host. since wolbachia and mitochondria are co-transmitted and since wolbachia may have an impact on host energy metabolism  <cit> , it is possible that wolbachia have affected the mitochondria of wolbachia-dependent species in ways that are not reflected in the mtdna sequence. additional research will be required to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report the mitochondrial genome sequences of  <dig> species of filarial nematodes: acanthocheilonema viteae, chandlerella quiscali, loa loa, onchocerca flexuosa, and wuchereria bancrofti. although we had hypothesized that the presence of wolbachia endobacteria in some filarial nematodes may have had an impact on the content, organization or sequence of filarial mtdna, we found no evidence that supports this hypothesis. the  <dig> available filarial mitochondrial sequences are remarkably similar on the sequence level. future studies may determine whether functional differences exist between the mitochondria of wolbachia-dependent and independent filarial nematodes.
