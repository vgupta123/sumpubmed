BACKGROUND
mitochondria are subcellular organelles that appear only in eukaryotic cells. they are surrounded by two layers of membrane, the inner membrane and the outer membrane. proteins which are localized within mitochondria play important roles in energy metabolism process. inner membrane, outer membrane and matrix contain proteins which contribute to different procedures in energy metabolism. it has been proved that mitochondria are involved in several complex biological processes, like programmed cell death <cit>  and ionic homeostasis <cit> . there are over  <dig> kinds of complex diseases related with mitochondria. thus, it is important to understand the protein function within mitochondria.

knowing protein localization is an important step to understand its function. but, to experimentally identify the protein subcellular location is costly and time consuming. a host of computational systems which are designed for predicting protein subcellular location had been developed during the last two decades. various features of sequence had been used for predicting protein subcellular location, such as terminal signalling peptides <cit> , amino acid composition  <cit> , pseudo-amino acid composition <cit> , dipeptide composition <cit> , functional domain composition <cit>  and go information <cit> . and a number of machine learning approaches had been introduced to predict protein subcellular location, such as the markov chain method <cit> , discriminate function <cit> , svm <cit> , artificial neural network <cit> , oet-knn <cit> , fuzzy-knn <cit>  and classifier fusion technique  <cit> . some reviews described most of these methods in detail <cit> . most of these methods assigned a unique subcellular location for a protein. but other methods can assign more than one subcellular locations for a protein  <cit> , which are called multiplex subcellular location predictors.

recently, the advances of experimental technology have enabled the large-scale identification of nuclear proteins <cit> . a database for nuclear proteins and their subnuclear location has been constructed <cit> . the prediction of protein subcellular location has been extended to a new level, the subnuclear level <cit> , where the protein location within cell nucleus can be predicted.

to the best of our knowledge, however, there exists no computational system for predicting protein submitochondria location. in this paper, we develop a computational system called submito to predict the submitochondria location for a protein only from its primary sequence. the system can assign one of the three submitochondria locations which are mitochondria inner membrane, mitochondria outer membrane and mitochondria matrix for a sequence. since there had been several sophisticated methods for predicting mitochondria protein, like mitopred <cit> , this prediction that goes one level deeper should be a good complement to the mitochondrial protein identification systems.

membrane protein type prediction is another challenging problem. some powerful methods  <cit>  have been introduced to predict membrane protein type for a membrane protein. we try to integrate membrane protein type prediction with submitochondria location prediction. we predict the membrane protein type for a protein after we predict it to be a membrane protein. due to the limitation of the data, we only predict membrane protein type for mitochondrial inner membrane proteins.

we hope that our work can provide a useful complement to those subcellular location predictors which are developed previously.

RESULTS
evaluation method
since the leave-one-out cross validation method is more objective and rigorous <cit>  than sub-sampling methods, we adopt leave-one-out cross validation method in our work to get a more accurate estimation of prediction accuracy and matthew's correlation coefficient <cit>  which are widely used statistics for evaluating the performance of subcellular location predictors.

the prediction accuracy and matthew's correlation coefficient of the ith location are defined in equation  <dig> and equation  <dig> respectively.

prediction performance
the leave-one-out cross validation result is shown in table  <dig> 

after a sequence is predicted to localize at inner membrane, we continue to predict its membrane protein type. in the correctly identified  <dig> inner membrane proteins, there are  <dig> of them predicted to be correct membrane protein type. there are only  <dig> of them predicted to be wrong membrane protein type. the method correctly predicts the membrane protein type and the submitochondria location for  <dig> % of the  <dig> inner membrane proteins. for different membrane protein types,  <dig> out of  <dig> multi-pass inner membrane proteins are predicted correctly, the success rate is about  <dig> %;  <dig> out of the  <dig> matrix-side membrane protein are predicted correctly, making the success rate about  <dig> %.

prediction on complete proteome
we adopt our method on the complete sequenced mitochondrial proteome of arabidopsis thaliana to demonstrate that our method can predict a fraction of protein to different submitochondria locations. the mitochondrial proteome of arabidopsis thaliana is downloaded from ampdb <cit> .

the prediction result is shown in table  <dig>  our method predicts that about 21% of all proteins are in the inner membrane, 13% of all proteins are in the outer membrane and 66% of all proteins are in the matrix. the distribution of the prediction result shows that the majority of the arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria proteome are located at matrix. the experimental research on yeast mitochondria proteome <cit>  also shows that the majority of the mitochondria proteome are soluble proteins. this observation consists with our prediction results. because only a very small part of these proteins are annotated with submitochondria location , we can not provide a good estimation for the prediction accuracy on this particular mitochondria proteome. however, our method can correctly identify most of these annotated sequences . this implies that our method should be a novel tool for computational annotating those sequences without submitochondria location annotation.

discussion
result
because there exists no other method for predicting protein submitochondria location, we are unable to provide a comparison with other methods. we are focusing on different dataset even for the membrane protein type prediction part, so the comparison with other methods on the same basis is impossible. by reviewing the performance that most subcellular location predictors can achieve, we can say that our method has high overall prediction accuracy.

our method can identify proteins localized at the inner membrane and matrix very well, but identifying the outer membrane proteins does not work as well as the other two locations. for membrane protein type prediction part, our method can correctly predict membrane protein type for  <dig> % of the correctly predicted inner membrane protein. the accuracy of the whole cascade prediction is more than 80%. thus, our method is an effective method for predicting protein submitochondria location and the membrane protein type for mitochondria inner membrane proteins.

we show mcc value in each location in order to show a more comprehensive evaluation of the performance of our predictor. since mcc considers not only the number of true positives but also the number of false positives, false negatives and true negatives, it is more reliable and more comprehensive than accuracy statistic, especially when the training set is unbalanced. showing mcc and accuracy together can give the readers a clearer understanding on the performance of our method. the mcc range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  shows that our method has good prediction performance. and the accuracy we report should not be a result of the problem caused by unbalanced training set.

method
as we described in method section, we set the sequence identity cut off to 40%. as suggested by some recent research <cit> , the sequence identity should be controlled at level 25% to get rid of the homologues and redundancy bias. but if we use such low cut off value, we can not obtain enough sequences to build sufficient large training set. thus we use a higher sequence identity cut off value in order to get a balance between the homologues bias and the training set size.

we have tried different segmentation numbers which is the parameter c in our method. the prediction results of c =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  it is very interesting that the prediction accuracy of every submitochondria location seems to peak at a special c value. two of these peaks and the overall accuracy peak are on the same c value. this c value is  <dig>  so we finally choose c =  <dig> as an optimized parameter in our method.

another technique that had been rarely used previously in subcellular location prediction studies is the  <dig> kinds of physicochemical properties that we used in our method. as we described in method section, only  <dig> kind of physicochemical property had been used in chou's pseudo-amino acid composition. here we show a comparison result to demonstrate the usefulness of the additional physicochemical properties. we exclude all physicochemical properties except "hydrophilicity value" and "consensus normalized hydrophobicity" and perform prediction with these  <dig> properties. the comparison result is shown in table  <dig>  we find that the decrease in accuracy is significant after we exclude  <dig> kinds of physicochemical properties, especially the accuracy at outer membrane location. we believe that this decrease in accuracy is the result of losing information about long distance interaction between residues along the sequence.

software
the available data on submitochondria location in swiss-prot database increases rapidly, so we designed our software with an upgradeable architecture. the model we used in our software can be updated if a certain amount of new data is available. we will publish these updates on the web site of submito.

another point we need to make it clear is that submito only predicts submitochondria location for a mitochondria protein. users of submito should only submit known or predicted mitochondria protein to submito. if users only have an amino acid sequence, they should use mitopred  to predict whether the sequence is a mitochondria protein first. if the user submits a predicted mitochondrial protein to submito, the program's rate of false positives will be higher, as some of the submitted proteins will be false positives generated by the mitochondrial prediction server.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we develop a computational system for predicting protein submitochondria location only from its primary sequence. like subnuclear location prediction, submitocondria location predictor can predict the location of a protein with higher precision than subcellular location prediction. online service and software submito has been developed for predicting protein submitochondria location. by reviewing similar work at the subcellular level, predicting submitochondria location is still a challenging problem.
