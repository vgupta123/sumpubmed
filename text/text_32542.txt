BACKGROUND
numerous dna sequences giving rise to small non-coding rnas  have been found in bacterial plasmids, phages, transposons and chromosomes. estimates of the number of ncrna genes in e. coli range from  <dig> to several hundred  <cit> . the first ncrnas were detected in the 1960s by chance, discovered by direct labelling as being associated with proteins on migration gels or identified after random mutations. the abundance of bacterial genome sequence data has allowed gene-finding computer programs to annotate a large number of prokaryote sequences. however, although de novo annotation programs successfully identify and map protein-coding genes, they are not designed to identify ncrna genes. recently, the intergenic regions  of selected bacteria and yeast genomes were systematically searched for ncrna genes. these computational screenings involved a combination of criteria, including large gaps between protein-coding genes  <cit>  even though in sulfolobus solfataricus,  <dig> small rnas  have been found encoded either within, or overlapping, annotated open reading frames  <cit> . other criteria used are extended conservation between species  <cit> , orphan promoter or terminator sequences  <cit> , base-composition signatures  <cit> , and conserved secondary structures in deduced rna sequences  <cit>  even if not always significant  <cit> . recently, ncrna research algorithms have been developed including some or all of these criteria  <cit> . supplementary in vivo experiments involving for example studies of expression patterns by northern blotting or microarray testing are still essential to confirm that the srna candidate genes are indeed transcribed; such studies also provide information about temporal expression patterns, potential precursor forms and degradation products. in addition to in silico analysis, experimental in vivo rnomics were also developped   <cit> .

ncrnas are involved in a great variety of processes including chromosome replication and cell division , transcriptional regulation , rna processing , mrna stability and translation , protein stability  and transport , stress adaptation , transition from growth to stationary phase , quorum sensing and virulence , plasmid copy number control , carbon storage , and oligopeptide transport . some provide housekeeping functions and others are regulators of stress gene expression, e.g. srnas modulating the bacterial cell surface by antisensing outer membrane protein  genes . in many cases, ncrnas are associated with proteins that enhance their function . their mechanisms of action can be grouped into three main categories: antisense by base-pairing with another rna/dna molecule , rna structure mimicry  and catalytic functions . these categories are not exclusive . also, not all mechanisms of action are known and it is likely that some ncrnas act in ways that have not yet been described.

sinorhizobium meliloti  is a common gram-negative soil bacterium that lives symbiotically on the roots of certain genera of leguminous plants . the bacterium enters the root tissue through infection threads and forms nodules, inside which it converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. in return, the plant provides an energy source for the bacteria. excess nitrogen remains in the soil, potentially reducing the need for fertilisers. s. meliloti is one of the best known rhizobia; it has been extensively studied by numerous groups worldwide and is readily amenable to genetic studies. like many other members of the alpha-proteobacteria, this fast growing rhizobium possesses a multipartite genome: a  <dig> -mb chromosome and two megaplasmids, psyma  and psymb   <cit> . its genome shares various fundamental similarities with those of some other symbiotic bacteria and various plant  and animal pathogens . as for most sequenced prokaryotic genomes, the annotation of the s. meliloti genome has led to the prediction of protein-coding genes but yielded very little information about non-coding rna genes. when the genome sequence of the s. meliloti strain  <dig> was completed  <cit> , its rnome was only composed of three identical rrna operons,  <dig> trnas , and a single annotated ncrna, ssra . the characterisation and expression patterns of this rna gene were recently published  <cit> . two other ncrnas are described in dedicated databases  <cit>  one matching rnpb, the rna component of the ubiquitous rnase p ribonucleoprotein enzyme, and the other ffs , the rna constituent of the signal recognition particle . recent work by maclellan with s. meliloti strain  <dig>  <cit>  and izquierdo with strain gr <dig>  <cit>  also describes ctrnas  involved in plasmid incompatibility. in addition, 5' untranslated regions  of mrnas that act as "riboswitches" have also been predicted in s. meliloti. those cited by the rfam database  <cit>  sense concentrations of vitamins b <dig>  and b <dig> , of thiamine  and of glycine . corbino et al.  <cit>  also describe riboswitches for methionine  and serine , as well as elements upstream of suhb, smc <dig>  and smc <dig> . no lysine, leucine, threonine or tryptophan riboswitches have been predicted in s. meliloti or in related alpha-proteobacteria. finally, a repression of heat shock gene expression  element is also annotated in the rfam database, in the 5' translated region of smb <dig> .

the purpose of this study was to discover unidentified small rna genes in the chromosome of s. meliloti and related alpha-proteobacteria. we used computational comparative genomic prediction of srna gene candidates combined with expression profiling using dedicated microarrays, followed by northern hybridization. this approach revealed  <dig> previously unidentified srnas, eight of which are widely conserved in the alpha-proteobacteria phylum. these analyses suggest that, like other free-living bacteria, alpha-proteobacteria encode numerous srnas, although their number and their nature may differ between species.

RESULTS
profile of small rnas in s. meliloti
staining of total rna from bacteria resolved on gels reveals abundant srnas  <cit> . we used this method to analyse s. meliloti small rna . four intense bands were detected, three of which correspond to the sizes predicted for 5s rna ,  <dig> s rna , and the 5' end of tmrna . band  <dig>  corresponds to a length and migration profile compatible with trnas. no rnas migrating faster than  <dig> nt were detected. two less intense bands  were observed and were compatible with sizes predicted for rnpb rna and for the 3' end of tmrna  <cit> . northern blotting confirmed the identity of each of these bands . surprisingly, no additional rnas were visualized with either rna extraction method  or stress . this experiment indicated that small rnas do not constitute an abundant class of rnas in s. meliloti, in contrast to what has been observed in marine cyanobacteria and in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . as a consequence, we could not employ direct elution and sequencing to identify new srnas  <cit>  in s. meliloti. we thus used computational prediction to identify candidates for further testing.

known srnas of s. meliloti: distinguishable biases?
ncrnas in at-rich hyperthermophiles can be located on the basis of local variations in genomic base composition  <cit> . although the s. meliloti chromosome is gc-rich , we scanned the regions containing tmrna, rnpb and ffs  for base composition signals. unlike at-rich genomes, no difference was observed between srna and background genomic sequences . blast alignments of the three srnas against all sequenced bacteria revealed significant similarities with sequences from the alpha- <dig> subgroup of the class proteobacteria. however maximum likelihood trees  showed that most identical sequences were from different genomes . to conclude, no apparent dominant bias was observed for the three known s. meliloti ncrnas, except primary sequence conservation in igrs of related alpha-proteobacteria genomes .

selection of srna candidate genes in the s. meliloti chromosome
most bacterial srna searches were conducted using the e. coli genome as a reference, so we first compiled the srnas available in the rfam database for that organism  to try to identify srna orthologs using blast alignments  against the complete s. meliloti chromosome sequence. no significant similarities were detected except for  <dig> s and rnpb . ssra  was not detected, presumably because the s. meliloti tmrna is in a two-piece "permuted" form  <cit> . surprisingly, the "ubiquitous" ssrs  was not detected either. similar analysis with bacillus and pseudomonas srnas  gave no further hits. this first approach confirmed a key point: most srnas cannot be detected by inter-phylum primary sequence identity.

rna-specific tools described in the literature were then assessed. however, most rely on preliminary structural knowledge, knowledge which is poor for this phylum. thus only a subset of these tools was tested: those reported to be able to detect new srna gene candidates in prokaryotic species. isi  relies on inappropriate filters , and was far too sensitive if the filters were disabled . the use of qrna  <cit>  requires preliminary alignments. we tested it by aligning the  <dig> srnas annotated in the e. coli  genome against s. meliloti's chromosome, but only  <dig> s and rnpb were predicted by this tool. finally, we assessed srnapredict <dig>  <cit> , which combines commonly srna-associated genetic features; it was used to search the s. meliloti chromosome igrs for srnas, by comparison with a. tumefaciens and r. etli. as shown in the output tables ,  <dig> srnas were predicted, seven being common to the two genomes compared. however, a detailed analysis of each candidate revealed that only one  was likely to correspond to a genuine small rna gene whereas the others are almost certainly 5' utrs  or repeated elements .

we ended up selecting for further analysis: the igrs containing the origin of replication oric  and the tmrna, rnpb and  <dig> s rna genes;  <dig> igrs longer than  <dig> nt;  <dig> igrs showing short sequence identity in alpha-proteobacteria ; and  <dig> igrs selected using the artemis comparison tool  with related genomes . indeed, the sequence identities marked by the act were mostly confined to actual open reading frames , even between two close chromosomes . although hits in intergenic regions were extremely rare , all three s. meliloti known srnas  were included in these hits: we thus concluded similar act-visualized igrs represented good srna gene candidates. among these igrs, those containing large repeats  or rimes were however excluded, as were igrs smaller than  <dig> nt .

this selection accounted for  <dig> candidate igrs , which throughout this paper shall be referred to as sra, followed by a number corresponding to their order of apparition on the chromosome .

detection of expression using microarrays and northern dotting
microarray hybridization was the first method used to test for transcription of the srna candidates; an igr-dedicated array was used . the initial goal of the time-course microarray experiments was to detect ncrna gene transcripts in various conditions. we first monitored gene expression over time during growth in minimal  and rich  media. the average log <dig> snr of the three known ncrnas  and the ribosomal rna 5s  was very low  in mv medium, but was higher  in lb medium . we applied various stresses, as described in materials and methods, but detected no specific induction . we therefore used lb medium for expression analyses and the results are expressed as a heat map . we also checked the expression of all of the candidates by northern dot blotting. twenty-five candidates were found to give a strong hybridization signal  and nine gave weak but detectable signals. among the dot blot-"positive" igrs, ten did not show significant expression on microarrays , perhaps due to insufficient fluorescent labelling . twenty-three igrs gave no transcription signal either in northern dot blots or in microarrays . these included sra <dig>  which corresponds to the s. meliloti origin of replication  and was used as an internal negative control. indeed, various methods  have been used to demonstrate that there is no transcription at this site . lastly,  <dig> igrs giving a transcription signal on microarrays were not confirmed by northern dot blotting; in these cases the signal may have originated from surrounding coding genes.

small rna transcripts detected by northern hybridization
northern blotting was used to detect srnas. the same probes as for northern dots were used but after hybridization of newly purified rna from fresh cultures. for some candidates, probes were redrawn to target areas common to all considered subgroup- <dig> alpha-proteobacteria. sra <dig> was discarded because it appears to correspond to a pseudo phe-trna gene . this locus is possibly a vestige or a target of dna insertion; indeed, a 500-kb symbiosis island has been shown to integrate into a phe-trna in the m. loti chromosome  <cit> .

four srna candidates  gave large transcripts , inferred to be part of adjacent orfs for three reasons:  they were larger than the intergenic region;  they were large enough to encompass one of the flanking coding genes; and  the strand detected corresponded to the orientation of at least one of the flanking genes. we did not pursue investigations to determine whether these 5'/3' utrs encompass cis-regulatory rna structures.

the signals detected for sra <dig>  sra <dig> and sra <dig> were very strong and composed of multiple bands . for sra <dig> and sra <dig>  the explanation is sequence-specific hybridization of the probe to various transcripts due to small imperfect dna repeats . the sra <dig> candidate corresponds to a repeated region that coincides with the fixt loci, present in three copies in the genome of s. meliloti  <cit> . in the two first copies, fixt genes  are co-located with fixk genes . the third copy region of fixt gene  encompasses sra <dig>  which corresponds to a fixk <dig> pseudogene .

however, it cannot be concluded that the  <dig> candidates  for which no transcript was detected by microarray or northern blot experiments correspond to false predictions: some of them may possibly be true srnas, but which are poorly or not expressed in the conditions tested.

analysis of the  <dig> newly identified small rnas
we further investigated the  <dig> srna candidates that yielded signals with a suitable size in northern blots . we excluded  sra <dig>  that contains a possible  <dig> amino acid orf and sra <dig>  which is a probable leader for rpsf   <cit> ; we also excluded sra <dig> that may encode a short peptide  rather rich in cysteine . the  <dig> first aa  correspond to a predicted transmembrane segment whereas 30% of the  <dig> other residues are positively charged amino acids. this biochemical configuration is found in small molecular peptide ion channels, such as defensins, involved in host-defences.

of the  <dig> remaining rnas, six correspond to s. meliloti-specific srnas . all except sra <dig> lie within a genomic island  <cit>  . all these srnas are absent from agrobacterium and other rhizobium species, consistent with the absence of the three genomic islands from these related genomes. the "coding potential" of sra <dig>  sra12a, sra12b and sra <dig> was assessed and only sra <dig> could translate a small non-conserved  <dig> aa peptide. there may be a relationship between their biological functions and their presence in genomic islands as bacterial islands are often related to eukaryotic host cell colonization . indeed bacterial srnas were recently detected in the pathogenicity island of staphylococcus  <cit>  and in salmonella . multiple 5' and 3' race mapping of these candidates was unsuccessful, possibly due to insufficient cdna or because they are too small for satisfactory cloning. with no available orthologous sequences, determination of extremities through alignment and structure prediction based on covariations are not possible. the functions of these new non-coding genes are thus unknown. however, many small rnas in bacteria act as post-transcritptional regulators via base-pairing action, so we used targetrna  <cit>  to assess their capacity to act as antisense rnas. no significant putative target was found for sra <dig>  sra12a, sra <dig> or sra <dig>  but sra12b and sra <dig> match with mrna targets . one interesting targetrna prediction was the interaction between sra <dig> and a tolr-exbd-like gene . tolr-exbd proteins are membrane-bound transport proteins essential for ferric ion uptake in bacteria  <cit> , and small rnas modulating the free intracellular iron pool have indeed been identified in other bacteria .

ud : undetermined

in e. coli, srna genes were considered to be conserved if the alignment had an e-value lower than  <dig>   <cit> . on this basis, the sequences of the eight remaining expressed s. meliloti sra genes are highly conserved in related alpha-proteobacteria . sra <dig> is even an analog of escherichia coli's 6s rna  that has recently been corroborated by rfam. sra <dig> may thus be considered as a fortuitous positive control, validating our experimental approach. all these conserved sra genes we describe were then subjected to transcriptional element analysis, structure prediction using covariation, and potential mrna target prediction.

genomic synteny for alpha-proteobacteria sra genes
s. meliloti chromosomal srna-encoding genes have a slight distribution preference, 70% of them being on the left replicore, but no preference was observed concerning the leading or the lagging strand . the conservation of gene adjacency  may be associated with functional relationships   <cit> . therefore, we assessed the conservation of neighbouring genes for the eleven alpha-proteobacterial sra, including tmrna, rnpb and  <dig> s . we found only three  where both flanking genes were conserved and four with one conserved flanking gene . three display no synteny . however, our observations suggest that in alpha-proteobacteria, functional association between srnas and conserved adjacent genes is uncertain, as even smpb is not linked to tmrna .

conserved sra gene transcriptional signals
the computational identification of promoter sequences is difficult because signals are weak  <cit> . consensus binding sites have been proposed for the s. meliloti σ <dig> and σ54-dependent promoters . using relaxed regular expressions , we scanned the 5' utr region of each sra gene to detect any such consensus . in the same way than for the orphan candidates, the end-mapping experiments remained unsuccessful for all new candidates but sra <dig> , thus the exact sites of the extremities of the sra genes are unknown. however, sequence alignment between several alpha-proteobacteria was informative. as for orfs, no significant nucleotide identities were apparent in the 5' and 3' regions . thus, the start and stop of the alignment and the sizes deduced from electrophoretic motility were used to define the ends of each sra gene. we only detected consensus σ70-promoters in the ubiquitous ncrnas  and the 5'-utr mapped region of sra <dig> . even with a larger spacer between the - <dig> and - <dig> boxes , no consensus sequence was detected in the other sra genes. similarly, only the ffs 5'-utr matches a possible σ <dig> binding site. however, s. meliloti contains a large number of predicted sigma-factors , it is therefore possible that sra genes are dependent on them. unfortunately, melina-based  <cit>  motif extraction from the promoter regions of these genes was inconclusive and did not show any consensus.

we also looked for potential classical l-shaped terminators  at the alignment-deduced 3' end of each sra. as most terminators in gc-rich bacteria have no long consecutive u-stretches  <cit> , we also looked for i-shaped  and v-shaped  terminators . terminator structures could be predicted for all conserved sra genes, except sra <dig> and sra <dig>  for which the alignments are too short for the ends to be accurately mapped. all three shapes were found, i-shapes being the most common. this supports the proposal that "orphan" terminators in igrs may indicate the presence of an sra gene, although because of the high gc content of the s. meliloti genome, stable stem-loops are frequent and consequently not very informative.

conserved sra genes predicted structure and mrna targets
the structures of non-coding rnas are important for their function. consequently, we made a conserved secondary structure prediction for all alpha-proteobacteria sra genes .

we first compared the  <dig> s and 6s alifold  <cit>  and rnaz  <cit> , outputs with the equivalent rfam structure . the two tools give different structures for  <dig> s, the alifold prediction being closer to that of rfam than the rnaz prediction. however, bulge a, the minimal site required for binding to ef-g  <cit> , is similarly folded in the three models. the three predicted structures of sra <dig>  are similar, 6s being folded as a largely double-stranded rna with a single-stranded central bulge. however, the 3' side of the central bulge can form a stable stem-loop in alpha-proteobacteria, as previously described  <cit> .

the predicted structure of sra <dig> is well-conserved, composed of three long hairpins: the central one, ending with a  <dig> nt loop, is strictly conserved, and the 3' and 5' stem-loop structures present co-varying nucleotides. analogous design  was found for the e. coli srnas drsa, micc and qrr  <cit> . no significant target mrna was found using the full rna but the 15-nt loop presents complementarity with the 5'-utr of the smc03977-smc <dig> operon . these two genes have paralogs, mostly in alpha-proteobacteria genomes. the function of smc <dig> is unknown but smc <dig> belongs to the zapa cell division family of proteins  <cit> . zapa binds the ftsz cell division gene, which has been reported to undergo antisense inhibition in e. coli  <cit> , so sra <dig> is possibly implicated in cell division regulation.

sra <dig> was only identified in rhizobia , however with remarkable primary sequence identity. its predicted secondary structure is also highly conserved, composed of a long stem with one central bulge and a small hairpin. the 3' end structure was predicted to act as a stabilization terminator. a possible pairing with the 5' utr of a gene encoding a putative membrane protease protein  was proposed by targetrna, although with low significance . this protein resembles the e. coli hflkc protein, known to interact with the cell division protease ftsh  <cit> . as for sra <dig>  we propose that sra <dig> may have a role in the s. meliloti cell cycle.

only alifold proposed a consensus structure for sra33: it resembles other short bacterial srnas including ryee  <cit> . predictions for sra <dig> showed strong pairing ability with the 5' ends of smc <dig> and of rkpj. the first gene is organized in an operon structure with smc <dig> , defining a post-segregational killing toxin-antitoxin  system. this type of mechanism, involving srnas in the inhibition of ta systems, has been extensively described in e. coli  <cit> . finding such a mechanism in s. meliloti is interesting as we recently detected approximately  <dig> ta loci  in the complete genome sequence  <cit> .

sra <dig> is the only small rna predicted both by srnapredict <dig> and act analysis. for this gene, hybridization was tested by northern blot and a signal was obtained for two of the most distant members: a. tumefaciens  and r. elti  . the secondary structures of sra <dig> were predicted by both alifold and rnaz; 59% of the nucleotides can pair in seven conserved regions, those at the 3' and 5' ends  possibly forming stabilization stem-loops. only the primary sequence of tb <dig> is conserved, all other structures being supported by covariations. the search for potential mrna targets yielded significant predictions for flim  and smc <dig> . the same sequence of sra <dig>  is predicted to pair with the 5' leader region of both mrna targets. discovery of a putative flagella antisense rna in s. meliloti and related bacteria is interesting. indeed, all these bacteria interact with plant or mammal cells and flagella are cell-surface components required for eukaryotic-prokaryotic cells interactions  <cit> .

finally, structure and target prediction of sra <dig> needed preliminary analysis as  two signals were detected by northern hybridization  and  sra <dig> is present in three imperfect copies, two in tandem in the same chromosomal igr and the third, with a more divergent primary sequence, maps in psyma. additionally, sra <dig> is well-conserved in alpha-proteobacteria and is present in two to three copies, on both chromosomes and plasmids except in agrobacterium . translatable small orfs are predicted within some sra <dig> candidates  whereas others are devoid of complete coding frames. a similar conserved structure was proposed for the three s. meliloti copies, composed of three stem-loops as described for sra <dig>  target mrnas were predicted separately for each of the three sra <dig> copies in s. meliloti. the only predicted target for the first chromosomal copy is smc <dig>  which encodes a hypothetical protein with a sel <dig> repeat-containing domain. the second copy is predicted to interact with two mrnas encoding smc <dig>  a transmembrane protein with homologies to efflux carrier proteins, and smc <dig>  a glucoprotease-like protein possibly involved in chaperoning processes. no significant target was predicted for the psyma copy.

CONCLUSIONS
we used computational comparative genomic screening to search for small rna genes in s. meliloti and related alpha-proteobacteria, as very few srnas had been identified in this phylum  <cit> . from a list of  <dig> s. meliloti candidate igrs , we show that  <dig> encode small rnas . this work constitutes a significant advance in small rnas studies in alpha-proteobacteria.

a possible antisense function was suggested for 57% of the sra genes, although these predictions remain based on targetrna estimations. to validate these antisense activities, further in vitro validation of predicted target genes will be necessary, even if targetrna's e-value was set to a highly significant threshold . it is however interesting to notice that the functions of the predicted mrna targets are various, including roles in transport, membranes and toxin-antitoxin systems. however, antisense rnas may act on transcription termination, translation, mrna degradation and can be activators and/or repressors. as a consequence, accurate in silico prediction of sra functions is difficult. the specific physiological roles of these newly discovered genes in alpha-proteobacteria regulatory pathways can only be determined by biological investigation. the initial regulation of each sra gene, i.e. the precise signalling conditions that trigger their expression should be analyzed, as this may give us clues about their roles. monitoring the expression of each sra under various conditions would require numerous experiments, as many parameters can be changed alone or simultaneously to simulate oxidative, heat, cold, and osmotic stresses as well as nutrient and metal starvation. in e. coli, hfq generally facilitates the pairing of ncrnas  <cit> . therefore the influence of the s. meliloti hfq homolog  in the sra-target mrnas hybrid formation could be analyzed by constructing a mutant. in parallel, screening should be extended to additional replicons : we show that sequence conservation in closely related bacteria igrs can indicate the presence of putative small sra genes.
