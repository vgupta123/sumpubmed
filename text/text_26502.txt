BACKGROUND
many kinds of animal, such as sheep, horse, bird and fish, are seasonal breeders. seasonal breeding is a critical limiting factor of animal fecundity. most sheep in northern china are estrous in the short-day season and anestrus in the long-day season  <cit> . therefore, ewes cannot mate during anestrus and no lambs can be born for several months. thus, for the mutton industry, seasonal estrus has been a bottleneck limiting efficient lamb meat supply throughout the year.

micrornas  belong to a large family of endogenous non-coding rnas and have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators. many mirnas have been identified in hircine ovary  <cit> , mammary gland  <cit> , testis  <cit> , skin  <cit> , hair  <cit> , or ovine muscle  <cit> . recently, genome-wide changes of mirnas associated with follicular-luteal transition were identified in ovine ovary  <cit> . previous studies in mice and pig indicated that mirnas play critical roles in almost all ovarian biological processes . for sheep, the obvious difference of ovarian biology exists between ovine anestrus and the breeding season. however the roles of mirnas in the regulation of ovine seasonal estrus are unknown. moreover, to date, only  <dig>  ovine mirnas have been identified and listed in the mirbase database . the characteristics of mirna profiles in the ovine anestrus ovary are still unclear.

piwi-interacting rnas  are a recently discovered class of small non-coding rna with a typical length between  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt . they are typically clustered in the genome in a mono-directional or bi-directional manner. they are highly expressed in sperm cells and have also been identified in oocytes and ovaries of drosophila and mammals . the pirna pathway is essential in early oogenesis and in transposon silencing in follicle cells  <cit> . however, there has been no description of pirnas in the ewe ovary until now.

to understand the roles of srna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in ovine seasonal estrus, it is necessary to identify the differentially expressed small rnas in ovine ovaries during anestrus and the breeding season. in northern china, the small tail han  sheep is a famous local breed because of its year-round estrus and prolificacy. tan sheep is another popular breed in northern china because of its delicious meat and excellent lamb skin; however, it has a long anestrus stage usually from april to july. therefore, the two breeds were considered ideal models for this study.

in this study, the expression profiles of small rnas in ewe ovaries were compared between anestrus  and three distinct stages  during the breeding season using solexa sequencing technology. kegg pathway analyses were then implemented on target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas. the correlation between the expressions of mirna and their target genes in reproduction related pathways were analyzed. since seasonal estrus involves changes in hormone secretion in different seasons, the reproductive hormone levels were also determined in tan and sth sheep during anestrus and the breeding season. collectively, these esults will help us to understand the role of mirnas in the regulation of seasonal estrus.

RESULTS
dynamic changes of ovine hormone levels between anestrus and the breeding season
hormone fluctuation is a characteristic of reproductive status transition. the reproductive hormones levels in tan and sth sheep were detected in anestrus and at different stages of the breeding season . briefly, the levels of estrogen, progesterone and luteinizing hormone  in anestrus were significantly lower compared to those in the breeding season . specifically, the secretion patterns of the four hormones were different. a high concentration of estrogen can promote estrus while a low level inhibits estrus. our results showed that its secretion gradually increased from anestrus to the luteal phase, proestrus and estrus. progesterone is a hormone secreted mainly by the corpus luteum, and it showed the lowest level in anestrus and the highest level in the luteal phase. follicle-stimulating hormone  and lh are two important endocrine regulators of follicular growth, development and ovulation. our results demonstrated that their concentrations in anestrus were significantly lower  than those in proestrus and estrus. the hormone results also confirmed that our samples used to perform rna-seq were collected from the right stages.figure  <dig>

overview of solexa-sequencing of ovine ovary small rnas
to understand the expression pattern of ovarian small rnas in anestrus and the three stages during the breeding season, eight srna libraries representing the different stages were constructed from eight adult tan and sth sheep ovary samples . the small rna libraries were subsequently sequenced and a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were obtained. after removing adapters and discarding sequences shorter than  <dig> nt or longer than  <dig> nt,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads remained  for further analysis. for all samples, 65-89% of the clean distinct tags  for each library were retained by clustering the same reads and aligning to the sheep genome . for example, in  <dig> , <dig> clean reads of the tsa sample,  <dig> , <dig> reads representing  <dig> % of total clean reads were aligned to the sheep genome sequence . in sth sheep, the mapped reads demonstrated a single-peaked length distribution with a peak at  <dig> nt  and in tan sheep, a length distribution with three peaks at  <dig> nt,  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt . the  <dig> nt length class was consistent with the common size of mirnas, whereas the  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt classes might represent pirnas. to further assess the efficiency of solexa sequencing for mirna detection, all of the mapped clean reads were annotated and classified by aligning against non-coding rnas  in the rfam database and mirbase  <dig> . for all samples except hae and tae, most srna sequences were clustered into mirna sequences . in addition to the highly enriched mirna sequences, there were also lowly expressed but much more diverse sequences of other ncrnas, such as rrnas, trnas, mrnas, snornas and other srnas in the rfam database .figure  <dig>

expression analysis of mirnas and mirna families in ovine ovary
a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified in ovine ovary, including  <dig> known mirnas,  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> predicated novel mirnas . all these mirnas were classified into  <dig> mirna families based on an established mirna family system . the size of mirna families varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . specifically,  <dig>  mirna families had a single member,  <dig>  had two members, and the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> families had the most members . it is noteworthy that different members in the same mirna family might display drastically different expression levels. for example, the expression abundance of let- <dig> family members varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads. the  <dig> most highly expressed mirna families were summarized for each sample . the mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , let- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  families were found to be preferentially expressed in ovine ovary. in addition to the above four families, the mir- <dig>  family was highly expressed in the tsa sample. the sum of mirna abundance of the top  <dig> mirna families represented more than 85% of total srnas in most samples, while this percent only reached 19% in the tsa sample.figure  <dig>

expression profile of ovarian mirnas in ovine anestrus
in this study, the whole expression profile of ovarian mirnas in ovine anestrus was determined for the first time. in total,  <dig> expressed mirnas, including  <dig> known,  <dig> conserved and three novel predicated mirnas were identified . compared to the other three stages, the number of expressed mirnas is the smallest and the total abundance of the top  <dig> mirna families is approximately 19% of all expressed srnas in anestrus stage sample, which suggests that novel mirnas were highly expressed in anestrus. therefore, mirnas in each sample were also ranked based on their level of expression . in the  <dig> most highly expressed mirnas, mir-n- <dig> , a newly identified conserved mirna, was the most abundant mirna in anestrus which accounted for 82% of the total expressed mirnas. kegg pathway analysis showed that the target genes of mir-n- <dig> were predominantly enriched in oxidative phosphorylation, glycerolipid metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. mir-n- <dig>  is another remarkably highly expressed mirna in anestrus, and its target genes were enriched in circadian rhythm, notch signaling and the gnrh signaling pathway. the other highly expressed mirnas, such as oar-let-7a, oar-mir- <dig> and oar-mir-125b have been reported to be highly expressed in ovine ovarian follicles  <cit> . the newly identified highly expressed mirnas in anestrus will facilitate understanding of their new roles in seasonal estrus.figure  <dig>

discussion
tan and sth sheep are two well known breeds in northern china, and they are seasonal and year-round breeders, respectively. to understand the roles of srna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in ovine seasonal estrus, we compared the small rna profiles of ovarian tissues between anestrus of tan sheep and three stages during the breeding season of both tan and sth sheep using solexa sequencing technology.

mirnas with high expression levels in anestrus and other stages during the breeding season
the information in the ovine mirna database has been enriched by this study and this is the first report of mirna expression profiles of anestrous ovine ovary tissues. some of the abundant mirnas in the anestrous ovary of tan sheep, including mir- <dig>  mir-26a, let- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were also reported to be highly abundant in ovaries of human, cow , pig  <cit> , adult and neonatal mouse  <cit>  and sheep  <cit> . moreover, according to our results, these mirnas were also highly expressed in ovine ovaries of different stages during the breeding season. this conserved high level of expression across mammalian species and reproductive stages suggests their important roles in mammalian ovarian function. in previous studies, mir- <dig> was identified to be able to promote follicular cell survival during ovulation  <cit> , mir- <dig> was critical for the formation of mouse primordial follicles  <cit>  and let-7b was shown to be necessary for normal development of the corpus luteum  <cit> . additionally, some kegg pathways, in which the target genes of these mirna were enriched, are important for ovarian function. for instance, mir- <dig> was significantly enriched in the gnrh signaling and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways, which are crucial for ovarian activity by influencing endocrine function and follicular development. in addition, the apoptosis, wnt signaling, and c21-steroid hormone metabolism pathways, which contain target genes of the let- <dig> family, are important for granulosa cell proliferation, follicular growth and development, and luteinic formation and regression. more importantly, mir-n- <dig> , a novel predicated conserved mirna, was the most highly expressed mirna in anestrus . its target genes were mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation, glycerolipid metabolism, and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. further research is needed to reveal its potential role in reproduction.

differentially expressed mirnas between anestrus and the other three stages in the breeding season
besides the mirnas with high levels of expression in anestrus,  <dig> mirnas that were differentially expressed between anestrus and the other three stages were also identified, and most of them were novel. of these, only the function of mir-n- <dig> had been studied and it is mainly involved in the regulation of proliferation of granulosa cells. yan et al. reported that mir-n- <dig> mediated attenuation of activin-induced proliferation of mouse granulosa cells by targeting both activin receptor 1b and cyclin d <dig>  <cit> . when cultured bovine granulosa cells were treated with forskolin  to promote luteinization, a decrease in the levels of mir-n- <dig> was observed during the follicular-luteal transition  <cit> . these results implied that mir-n- <dig> might mediate inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation during the follicular stage. during the ovine breeding season, the ovary is in the estrus cycle, including the follicular stage and luteal phase, so it is likely that the high level of mir-n- <dig> expression was involved in attenuating the proliferation of ovine granulosa cells. however, during anestrus the physiological activity of the ovary was relatively reduced and the follicular stage does not exist. thus the proliferation of granulosa cells is significantly attenuated. therefore, in our study, the low level of mir-n- <dig> expression observed in anestrus is reasonable.

reproduction-related pathways in which differentially expressed mirnas were enriched
the kegg pathway analysis indicated that some target genes of the differentially expressed mirnas were enriched in reproduction-related pathways . first, some pathways were crucial for the secretion of gonadal hormones, and there were some successive relationships among the pathways. specifically, both mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> were significantly enriched in estrogen–related pathways , and the target genes of mir-n- <dig> were significantly enriched in the insulin signaling pathway. as additional file  <dig> shows, the insulin signaling pathway may act on the estrogen–related pathway and ultimately they can regulate the biosynthesis of gonadal hormone  together. according to the rna-sequencing results, mir-n- <dig> expression was negatively correlated with that of 80% of its target genes in the steroid biosynthesis pathway; while the expression of mir-n- <dig> was negatively correlated with that of target genes  in the androgen and estrogen metabolism pathway. previous studies have indicated that the ewes in anestrus had relatively lower estrogen and progesterone levels compared with in the breeding season. in anestrus, progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum is suppressed because fewer ovulations led to a reduction of the total luteal volume; although it may also result from diminished gonadotropic support . our results for hormone determination also indicated that the level of estrogen and progesterone in anestrus of tan sheep were significantly lower than those in the breeding season of tan and sth sheep. these results suggest that mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> might play roles in the estrogen–related pathways by negatively regulating their target genes.

second, the enriched kegg pathways of differentially expressed mirnas are important for follicular and luteal development. targets of both mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> were enriched in the notch signaling pathway, which is necessary for follicular development  <cit>  and vessel formation in the follicle and corpus luteum  <cit> . correlation analysis indicated that the expression of mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> was negatively correlated with most of their target genes involved in the notch signaling pathway. trombly et al.  <cit>  reported that the suppression of notch signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors in the neonatal mouse ovary could decrease primordial follicle formation. complete blockage of the notch signaling pathway with compound e also impairs folliculogenesis and induces disruption of gonadotropin stimulated angiogenesis  <cit> . vorontchikhina et al. suggested that notch signaling plays an important role in angiogenic growth during mouse folliculogenesis and in the corpus luteum  <cit> . in the breeding season, the vessels are rich in the antral follicle and corpus luteum; however, in anestrus, little vessel formation occurs because of the absence of ovulation and the corpus luteum. collectively, these results indicate that mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> might play regulatory roles during vessel formation in the follicle and corpus luteum via the notch signaling pathway. another important pathway for follicular development is the mapk signaling pathway, and target genes of mir-n- <dig>  mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> were enriched in this pathway. the activation of the mapk pathway could promote leptin-stimulated oocyte maturation, and conversely the maturation could be blocked when leptin-induced mapk phosphorylation was suppressed by a specific mapk activation inhibitor  <cit> . in addition, the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway, in which the target genes of oar-mir-200a-3p were enriched, was related to maturation of the oocyte  <cit> .

third, it was interesting and unexpected that the target genes of mirnas including mir-n- <dig>  mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> were simultaneously enriched in the gnrh signaling pathway. in addition, some pathways relating to the gnrh signaling pathway were also involved; for example, the target genes of mir-n- <dig> were enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, and target genes of mir-n- <dig>  mir-n- <dig> and mir-n- <dig> were synchronously enriched in the mapk signaling pathway. it is noteworthy that these pathways could connect mutually in a network  and finally could regulate the secretion of gonadotropins , which are known as the crucial endocrine regulators of follicular growth, development and ovulation. recent studies in plants, animals and humans show that mirnas might regulate gene expression in other cells or tissues by migration to target cells or tissues . hence it is likely that, similar to how hormones secreted from the ovary can exert a feedback regulation on gonadotropins  in the hypophysis, these mirnas might be involved in similar regulation of gonadotropins by targeting genes in the above pathways. it has been reported that a low level of lh is necessary for anestrus  <cit> . the hormone levels in tan and sth ewes also showed that the concentration of lh in tan anestrus was significantly lower compared to that in the breeding season . collectively, these differentially expressed mirnas in ovine anestrus might mediate post-transcriptional regulation on secretion of lh by the gnrh signaling pathway.

finally, these findings provide candidates for further experimentation to identify mirnas which could be potentially used to regulate ovine seasonal estrus.

predicted pirnas in the ovine ovary
pirnas are a new class of small rnas that bind to the piwi argonaute protein family. large scale sequencing for pirnas from rat, mouse, fly and human has yielded very high numbers of pirna sequences, which can be acquired from pirnabank  <cit> . the pirna-piwi complexes have been reported to be involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing of retrotransposons and other genetic elements in germ line cells, particularly during spermatogenesis  <cit> . they were first discovered in spermatogenic cells  <cit>  and testicular cells in rat  <cit> . pirna also exist in mammalian ovaries  <cit>  and the pirna pathway is essential for early oogenesis  <cit>  and transposon silencing in follicle cells  <cit> . recently, it was found that pirnas have widespread expression in all macaque tissues  <cit> . usually, the length of pirnas is concentrated at 26– <dig> nt. in our study, the length distribution of small rnas showed double-peaks at 21– <dig> and 24– <dig> nt, and a considerable percentage  of reads were between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length. because of the lack of identified or previously reported pirnas in ewe, in the present study,  <dig>  candidate pirnas of 24– <dig> nt were first identified using de novo prediction and homology search methods, and they were classified into  <dig>  clusters. the number of pirnas was comparable to the number of pirnas previously found in other organisms listed in the pirnabank database. in our study the pirnas in the ovine ovary displayed a highly uneven distribution among chromosomes and were enriched on chromosome  <dig> and x. this characteristic has also been reported in porcine testes  <cit> . widespread pirna expression across all reproductive stages hinted at their important functions in ovarian activity.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, the mirna profiles of the ovine ovary in anestrus are presented. in total,  <dig> mirnas were identified in the ovine ovary. the expression patterns of the mirnas varied between different reproductive stages. compared with the three stages of the breeding season,  <dig> shared significantly differentially expressed  mirnas were identified in ovine anestrus. combining the results of pathway enrichment analysis, expression of target genes and hormone measurement, these differentially expressed mirnas in anestrus are indicated to participate in attenuation of ovarian activity by regulating the pathways relating to hormone secretion and follicular development. in addition, a large and unexpectedly diverse set of pirnas sequences were identified in the ewe ovary. our findings will help understanding of the role of mirnas in the regulation of seasonal estrus, and provides candidates for identifying mirnas which could potentially be used to regulate ovine seasonal estrus.
