BACKGROUND
an organism's environment is characterized by temporal and spatial fluctuations of temperature. the ability of the nervous system to elicit appropriate behavioral responses to a range of thermal stimuli is critical for the animal's survival. at the molecular level, the perception of different temperature ranges, at least in mammals, is determined by the activation thresholds of relevant neurons set by distinct combinations of transient receptor potential  and potassium channels  <cit> . however, beyond these thermosensors, the behavioral, neural and molecular correlates of the transformation of temperature perception to behavioral outputs are less well understood.

the nematode c. elegans is an ideal model system for uncovering the molecular and cellular bases of perception of a variety of thermal stimuli  <cit> . depending on the nature of the thermal stimulus, c. elegans displays distinct behaviors. during thermotaxis it can discriminate temperature differences of approximately  <dig> °c  <cit> . at the other extreme, temperatures approximately 16°c above the baseline elicit a stereotypical avoidance behavior in this organism  <cit> . although much is known about the neuronal and molecular bases of thermotaxis, the neurogenetic basis of the high temperature nociception is largely unknown, and only a few studies have examined intermediate thermal stimuli  <cit> . most studies of noxious avoidance behavior have focused on a single aspect of the behavioral response, such as the response latency or the fraction of animals responding. however, several components of the motor output change in a coordinated manner when an animal is exposed to noxious stimuli  <cit> . for a comprehensive understanding of the neurogenetic basis of the behavioral response elicited by thermal pulse stimuli, it is necessary to measure multiple aspects of behavior that change as a consequence of thermal stimuli. consideration of the multidimensional nature of a behavioral response will provide a better understanding of the role of a given molecule in shaping the behavior.

here, we developed a high-content assay that allowed us to quantify multiple aspects of the avoidance response of animals exposed to thermal pulse stimuli of different intensities. by analyzing the responses of  <dig> strains defective in various aspects of nervous system function in the laboratory strain  background and comparing their behavior with the n <dig> strain, we discovered multiple noxious temperature regimes in c. elegans defined by distinct combinations of molecules that converge onto a qualitatively similar stereotyped avoidance response.

RESULTS
a quantitative assay to characterize responses to thermal pulses of different amplitudes
to characterize the noxious temperature range of c. elegans, we transiently raised the local temperature around a forward-moving animal by defined amounts and quantified multiple aspects of the resulting avoidance response. heating was produced by infrared laser pulses of  <dig> -s duration. using thermal imaging, we determined that the increases in temperature above baseline  were directly proportional to the laser power, and that the heated area encompassed the entire animal . we were thus able to systematically deliver thermal pulses with a Δt between  <dig> °c to  <dig> °c. we recorded the behavior of each animal for  <dig> s in response to the thermal stimulus. from these images we measured basic features of shape such as the worm's 'skeleton', center-of-mass, head-to-tail distance, and used these measures to calculate the animal's speed and metrics of different behavioral states .

n <dig> animals exhibit dose-dependent changes in multiple aspects of the avoidance response elicited by thermal stimuli
n <dig> animals responded to a thermal pulse corresponding to a Δt =  <dig> °c with a stereotypical avoidance behavior that reorients the worm away from noxious stimuli. typically, a thermal pulse applied to a forward-moving animal elicited a sequence of four behavioral states: a pause, reversal, an omega turn, and forward movement . increasing the amplitude of the thermal pulse did not induce any gross qualitative changes in the sequence . however, the duration and the speed of locomotion during specific behaviors changed proportionately as a function of the Δt . from the speed  and ethograms , we quantified multiple behavioral parameters, including various aspects of speed changes, characteristics of different behavioral states, and the probability of switching between states at each Δt. we found that while some features of the behavior changed with the pulse amplitude, others were stimulus independent; that is, they remained constant over an approximately 25-fold change in the amplitude of the thermal pulse . for example, the pause duration , time to respond with an increase in speed  decreased as we increased the pulse amplitude. acceleration , the probability of responding with a reversal  and reversal duration  increased with the stimulus amplitude. however, the duration of omega turns remained constant over the entire range of stimuli . we also found that the peak speed with which the worms avoided the thermal stimulus increased with the intensity of the stimulus . however, the speed at the beginning of the thermal pulse stimuli did not change with an increase in amplitude of the thermal pulse . we were thus able to quantify multiple aspects of the noxious, thermally induced avoidance response of c. elegans and identify aspects of the behavior that changed proportionately with the intensity of stimulus. we chose Δt =  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for further analysis, as multiple behavioral features that scaled with temperature differed significantly among these thermal pulses.

unique combinations of molecules define responses to different increases in temperature
the quantitative differences in the avoidance behavior that we observed with increasing intensity of the thermal stimuli can be explained by either distinct molecular mechanisms operating at different temperature ranges or a single mechanism that scales with the amplitude of the thermal pulse. if a similar set of genetically distinct strains shows defects across a broad range of Δt, this would suggest a common molecular mechanism. on the other hand, if distinct sets of genetically different strains show defects at different temperature ranges, then this would suggest multiple molecular mechanisms. to distinguish between these possibilities, we recorded escape responses of  <dig> mutants in the n <dig> genetic background and extracted  <dig> behavioral features that changed with increasing intensity of the stimulus for each strain . we normalized each feature, scored in different units, to a common scale. thus at each thermal pulse, the responses of the strains were summarized as a 'phenotype barcode' of  <dig> features, generating a  <dig> strain ×  <dig> feature matrix at each Δt . hierarchical clustering of this strain x feature matrix identified strains that belonged to clusters different from n <dig> at each Δt . to identify strains that are robustly different from n <dig>  we bootstrapped the phenotype barcode data and identified strains different from n <dig> as ones that remained outside the n <dig> cluster in at least 90% of the bootstrap clusters .

as an independent means of identifying mutants that behave differently from n <dig> in response to a thermal pulse, we performed dimensionality reduction of the avoidance response barcodes. principal component analysis  of  <dig> phenotype features produced  <dig> principal components that together explained approximately 95% of the variance in the avoidance responses of the  <dig> strains at each Δt . we projected the strains in the six dimensional feature space onto two dimensions for each Δt . at all Δt, we identified the strains that were greater than a fixed euclidean distance away from n <dig> in this two-dimensional space as behaving differently from n <dig> . all but one of the strains deemed different from n <dig> at each Δt by this method were also predicted by bootstrapping . the only exception was strain unc- <dig> at Δt =  <dig> °c, which was predicted to be different from n <dig> only in the pca feature space but not by the bootstrap criteria . finally, we used non-parametric analysis of variance  on the list of the mutants predicted by either of the above criteria  to identify a final set of strains different from n <dig> . a total of  <dig> out of the  <dig> strains we tested were significantly different at either  <dig>  or more Δt . at each Δt, unique sets of strains were found to be different from n <dig>  suggesting that distinct molecular mechanisms underlie responses to noxious stimuli for temperature ranges examined.

two strains were significantly different from n <dig> at all Δt , consistent with the general nature of defects in their neuromuscular system. these strains, akis <dig>   <cit>  and twk- <dig>  <cit> , are known to be defective in locomotory command interneuron and muscle function, respectively. akis <dig> is a transgenic strain expressing human caspase  driven by the promoter of nmr- <dig>  which results in the death of all the command interneurons known to be involved in mediating reversals, as well as three additional pairs of neurons. these animals are unable to execute proper reversals, and were defective at all Δt . however, these animals frequently displayed an escape response that consisted solely of omega turns without any reversals . twk- <dig> is a temperature-sensitive gain of function mutation in a two-pore potassium channel expressed primarily in the body wall muscles  <cit> . this allele induces constitutive membrane hyperpolarization  <cit> , thereby reducing excitability of the muscle at room temperature  <cit> . consistent with this, animals harboring twk- <dig> were unable to elicit a wild-type escape response at any Δt .

thermotaxis and responses to noxious thermal pulses are genetically separable
thermotaxis in c. elegans is well studied at the behavioral, neuronal and molecular level  <cit> . to determine whether the molecular mechanisms underlying thermotaxis are also employed during the thermal avoidance behavior, we exposed  <dig> strains defective in thermotaxis behavior  to thermal pulses of different amplitudes. seven of these strains  were significantly impaired in responding to a Δt =  <dig> °c but exhibited normal responses to thermal pulses of larger amplitudes, suggesting that thermotaxis signals in response to small Δt are measured through a separate pathway from thermal noxious signals in response to larger Δt.

loss of function of the homeodomain proteins, ttx- <dig>  <cit>  and ttx- <dig>  <cit> , required for proper development of the thermosensory neuron afd and the interneuron aiy, respectively, results in constitutive cryophilic behavior. these mutants were defective in responses to Δt =  <dig> °c but displayed n2-like escape responses to thermal pulses of larger amplitudes . we also examined the molecules in the cyclic gmp  dependent signal transduction pathway, mutations in which results in animals with abnormal temperature preference. loss of function mutations in the genes encoding cgmp gated channel subunits, tax- <dig>  <cit>  and tax- <dig>  <cit> , as well as in three genes encoding guanylate cyclases, gcy- <dig>  gcy- <dig> and gcy- <dig>  <cit> , exhibited impaired avoidance responses to Δt =  <dig> °c . additionally, strains harboring mutations in tax- <dig> were significantly different in their escape responses to Δt = 1°c and  <dig> °c but exhibited normal responses at Δt =  <dig> °c . animals harboring mutations in three guanylate cyclases exhibited a normal avoidance response at larger Δt , suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved in mediating responses to noxious temperature of higher magnitudes.

the homologs of calcineurin   <cit>  and protein kinase c   <cit>  are thought to negatively regulate thermosensory function of afd, and loss of function of these genes results in constitutive thermophilic behavior. loss of function mutants in genes encoding these molecules were also defective at Δt =  <dig> °c . our analysis indicated that tax- <dig> mutant animals were also significantly different from n <dig> at Δt = 1°c and  <dig> °c but not  <dig> °c . tax- <dig> mutants had multiple defects  in their escape behavior at the lower Δts . all defects of tax- <dig> mutant animals in thermal avoidance behavior were rescued by expressing the normal version of the gene in sensory neurons and interneurons .

loss of function of the genes ncs- <dig>  encoding a neuronal calcium sensor protein  <cit> , cmk- <dig>  encoding a ca+2/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase i  <cit>  and ttx- <dig>  encoding a inositol monophosphatase, required for correct localization of synapses of the interneuron ria  <cit> , result in abnormal thermotaxis. all three strains exhibited wild-type avoidance response at higher Δt . however, while ncs- <dig> and ttx- <dig> mutants were defective at Δt =  <dig> °c , cmk- <dig> mutants behaved normally at that thermal pulse intensity.

mutants of genes required for proper sensory cilia development, namely osm- <dig> and osm- <dig>  <cit> , as well as of a gene encoding a secreted protein required for integration of sensory information, hen- <dig>  <cit> , were shown to exhibit normal thermotaxis behavior. animals harboring mutations in these genes were significantly impaired in their avoidance response to a thermal pulse of Δt =  <dig> °c . moreover, whereas the cilia defective mutants osm- <dig> and osm- <dig> were significantly impaired only at Δt =  <dig> °c, hen- <dig> animals were also unable to elicit a wild-type escape response at Δt =  <dig> °c . these animals behaved like wild-type at Δt =  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c. we have identified molecules  that are involved in responses to noxious thermal stimuli but are not required for thermotaxis. we also identified strains that are not defective in avoidance of thermal pulses but exhibit abnormal thermotaxis behavior . thus, thermotaxis and the escape response to a thermal pulse of Δt =  <dig> °c are genetically separable.

trp and two-pore k+  channels are required for mediating normal avoidance responses to Δt =  <dig> °c
although the major thermosensors of invertebrates are ion channels of the trp family  <cit> , such channels have a relatively mild role in mediating responses to thermal stimuli in c. elegans. for example, mutations in the trpv  homolog of c. elegans, osm- <dig>  <cit> , have been shown to exhibit mild defects in the thermal avoidance response  <cit> . however, the trpa ion channel homolog of c. elegans has been shown to be required for acute cold sensation  <cit> . to test the function of trp channels in sensing different intensities of noxious stimuli, we examined the avoidance response of nine strains with mutations in different trp channels elicited by thermal pulses with Δt of  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c. three of these mutants, trpa- <dig> , ocr-1;ocr- <dig>  and trp- <dig>   <cit> , were defective in avoidance responses to Δt =  <dig> °c, but their responses did not differ significantly from n <dig> at the higher Δt . however, we did not detect any major defect in the behavior of animals harboring mutations in the gene encoding trpv channel subunit homolog osm- <dig>  which is required for sensation of noxious thermal stimuli  in mammals.

twk channels have been implicated in defining temperature thresholds and ranges of activation of thermosensory neurons in mammals  <cit> . in c. elegans, there are approximately  <dig> genes encoding twk channels  <cit> . we examined the effect of loss-of-function mutations in four twk channels on the thermally induced avoidance responses. animals harboring loss of function mutations in either twk- <dig> or twk- <dig> were impaired in their avoidance response at Δt =  <dig> °c but not at higher Δt .

glutamatergic neurotransmission is essential for responses to Δt =  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c
glutamatergic neurotransmission has been reported to be essential for normal thermotaxis  <cit> , as well as for avoidance responses induced by noxious thermal stimuli  <cit> . thus it was likely that glutamate would play a role in the thermal avoidance response in our thermal pulse assays. to test this hypothesis, we examined three loss-of-function alleles of the gene encoding the vesicular glutamate transporter  that concentrates glutamate onto synaptic vesicles. all three alleles were defective in eliciting a wild-type response to a thermal pulse corresponding to Δt =  <dig> °c and 1°c, but were not significantly different from n <dig> at larger Δt . transgenic expression of functional eat- <dig>  driven by the odr- <dig> promoter, failed to rescue the defects of eat- <dig> at Δt =  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c and induced a significantly impaired escape response at Δt =  <dig> °c . odr- <dig> drives expression in a subset of neurons  in which eat- <dig> is normally expressed. our results suggest that additional neurons beyond the ones defined by the expression driven by odr- <dig> promoter are required to elicit a proper escape response at Δt =  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c. the abnormal phenotype at Δt =  <dig> °c and n2-like avoidance response at Δt =  <dig> °c of this strain suggest involvement of distinct sets of neurons contributing to avoidance responses at these thermal pulse amplitudes.

we also analyzed the thermally induced escape responses of animals harboring mutations in the genes encoding the 2-amino-3-propanoic acid  and n-methyl-d-aspartate  classes of glutamate receptors, as well as glutamate-gated chloride channels. we detected significantly impaired escape responses induced by Δt =  <dig> °c in strains harboring mutations in the glutamate-receptor subunit glr- <dig> and the glutamate-gated chloride channel glc- <dig> . escape responses of these strains to thermal pulses resulting in larger Δt were indistinguishable from n <dig> . however, we observed that eat- <dig> mutants were defective in their avoidance response at Δt =  <dig> °c  suggesting that different combinations of glutamate-gated channels were responsible for mediating effects of glutamatergic neurotransmission at Δt =  <dig> °c. additionally, defects in catecholaminergic neurotransmission due to a mutation in the vesicular monoamine transporter, cat- <dig>  resulted in abnormal avoidance responses only at Δt =  <dig> °c . thus response to a thermal stimulus of Δt =  <dig> °c requires participation of both glutamatergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmission.

neuropeptides define escape responses to a subset of thermal pulse stimuli
neuropeptide signaling was shown to be required for avoidance of noxious thermal stimuli  <cit> . we examined thermally induced avoidance responses of mutants harboring loss of function of genes encoding proprotein convertase  and carboxypeptidase   <cit>  that are required for efficient neuropeptide processing. we found that animals carrying loss-of-function alleles of these genes were defective in responding to a Δt =  <dig> °c. interestingly, all neuropeptide-processing-impaired strains were able to elicit an avoidance response similar to n <dig> at Δt =  <dig> °c. however, animals harboring loss-of-function mutations in egl- <dig> and egl- <dig> were defective at Δt =  <dig> °c and Δt =  <dig> °c, respectively. this difference probably reflects the penetrance of the different alleles of egl- <dig> and egl- <dig> with respect to the thermal avoidance behavior . we conclude that whereas glutamate and neuropeptide signaling is required for responses to Δt =  <dig> °c, neuropeptides but not glutamate are dispensable for responses at Δt =  <dig> °c. for higher Δt, we found neuropeptide but not glutamate involvement in mediating different aspects of the thermal avoidance behavior. taken together, these results suggest that distinct combinations of glutamatergic, catecholaminergic and peptidergic signaling shape avoidance responses at different intensities of noxious thermal stimuli. however, the lack of consistent responses for multiple alleles of the same gene precludes us from a definitive conclusion about the involvement of neuropeptides at higher Δt. nevertheless, taken together, these data suggest that distinct combinations of neurotransmitter systems operate at Δt =  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c to give rise to a qualitatively similar stereotypical behavioral response.

discussion
most studies on noxious temperature sensation of c. elegans have been restricted to responses resulting from a rise in temperature of approximately 10°c to 15°c above the baseline  <cit> . however, between thermotaxis, where animals sense an approximately  <dig> °c rise in temperature above the baseline, and noxious thermal stimuli, there is an approximately 200-fold change in temperature. in this study, we explored how an animal responds to changes in the noxious quality of thermal stimuli. we considered the noxious quality of the thermal stimuli to be proportional to the amplitude of the thermal pulses, and observed quantitative changes in the avoidance response with increasing amplitude of the stimulus. quantitative changes in the avoidance response could be due to either a single molecular mechanism proportionately changing with intensity of the stimulus, or multiple separate molecular mechanisms operating in distinct temperature ranges, which converge onto a qualitatively similar avoidance response. through use of multiple mutants, we provide evidence of a molecular partitioning of thermosensation in the temperature range of c. elegans that elicits an escape behavior. this property is similar to temperature sensation in mammals, where sensations of distinct temperature ranges are mediated by different sets of molecules. however, compared to mammals, discrimination of noxious temperature in c. elegans appears to be over a much narrower range.

within our candidate list of strains, we observed that avoidance responses at lower Δt involved a larger number of molecules. with increasing amplitude of the thermal pulse, fewer molecules were essential for generating a normal avoidance response. it is possible that multiple redundant pathways engage at larger Δt to generate the thermally induced avoidance response. consistent with the possibility of involvement of multiple redundant pathways in sensing noxious thermal stimuli, glauser et al.  <cit>  reported parallel involvement of a neuropeptide and a trp channel. additionally, liu et al.  <cit>  suggested that multiple neurons  and molecules  and trp channels) act in parallel to induce avoidance to noxious thermal stimuli. however, some noxious-avoidance-defective mutants reported by liu et al. and glauser et al., for example, the trpv and cyclic-nucleotide gated channel mutants, behaved normally in our assay for the largest stimulus Δt equal to approximately  <dig> °c. the assay of liu et al. involves Δt equal to approximately 16°c with an absolute peak temperature of 38°c, whereas our assay corresponds to Δt equal to approximately  <dig> °c with an absolute peak temperature of 33°c. also we heated the entire worm body as opposed to just the head or tail region of the worm, and we used a much steeper ramp rate. it is possible that there exists an additional trpv and cng channel-dependent temperature threshold beyond the ones we tested. further studies will be required to test this hypothesis, but it is clear that in the noxious temperature range of c. elegans, there exist multiple distinct molecularly determined temperature ranges that are quantitative determinants of the avoidance response. although we used well characterized mutants in our study, the lack of transgenic rescue experiments, except for tax- <dig>  prevents us from distinguishing whether the mutations in the genes themselves or additional mutations in the mutant background are shaping the avoidance response. this is perhaps less of a drawback for those cases where multiple alleles gave rise to a similar phenotype. this limitation, however, does not change our conclusion of distinct molecular combinations acting in different temperature regimes as we have compared the same set of strains in response to the same thermal stimuli.

responses to noxious temperature have previously been studied by scoring only one aspect of the avoidance behavior, for example, the fraction of animals responding by reversal. however, as we have shown, multiple aspects of the escape response change quantitatively with increasing intensity of the noxious stimuli. focusing on one aspect of the response could result in some mutants being misclassified as not significantly different from n <dig>  for example, a similar fraction of eat- <dig> and n <dig> animals responded to Δt =  <dig> °c by a reversal, however the time it took to initiate reversals was significantly longer for eat- <dig> animals. the multidimensional measure of worm behavior allowed us to better characterize the effect of genetic manipulations on the escape response.

our analyses also provided new insights into the effect of molecules on the motor output of the escape behavior. for example, akis <dig> animals frequently displayed an escape response that consisted solely of omega turns without any reversals for all Δt , suggesting that execution of reversals and omega turns is encoded by distinct neurons, in agreement with earlier studies  <cit> . in fact, even though akis <dig> did not perform a reversal, the duration of time before the observed omega turn increased with the Δt, just as the reversal time increases with the Δt for n <dig> worms, suggesting that parallel pathways process the thermal stimulus information that generates the duration of reversals or the timing of omega turns. additionally, animals harboring mutations in unc- <dig>  type calcium channels)  <cit>  were defective at all but the highest Δt. these mutants display a 'fainter' phenotype in which reversals are followed by an abrupt stop rather than by an omega turn, suggesting a block in switching from the reversal to omega turns. at lower Δt, the majority of animals moved backwards and paused instead of making an omega turn . this defect was largely suppressed when animals harboring mutations in unc- <dig> were exposed to a thermal pulse of Δt =  <dig> °c . this result suggests that the block from reversals to the subsequent motor pattern is bypassed by a thermal pulse amplitude somewhere between Δt =  <dig> °c and Δt =  <dig> °c.

analysis of the effect of genetic manipulations at a genome-wide scale, for example, through systematic rnai, should provide a comprehensive understanding of the neuronal and molecular basis of a simple sensorimotor transformation such as the one introduced here. similar studies incorporating multiple aspects of behavior have been used to classify different mutants or to screen the effects of drugs  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, the use of high-content data to understand the neurogenetic basis of a sensorimotor transformation is novel. high-content phenotyping and the behavioral barcoding approach, as exemplified by our study, will improve our understanding of how sequences of behavior are integrated at the neuronal and molecular level.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel laser-heating assay to comprehensively study the behavioral response of individual c. elegans to precise amounts of thermal stimulus. the multidimensional behavioral profile of worms was quantified using computer-based imaging and data analysis. a candidate library of  <dig> strains was studied to determine which sets of molecules are involved in thermal sensation at different stimulus intensities. the resulting data revealed that a number of genes involved in thermotaxis are not necessary for thermal nociception, and that different sets of molecules are involved in the thermal response to different thermal stimulus intensities.
