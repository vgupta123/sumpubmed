BACKGROUND
carotenoids are yellow to red colored pigments originating from the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. they are very abundant in plants and microorganisms, where they can have diverse functions such as photo protection or light harvesting molecules or as membrane stabilizers  <cit> . in the biosynthetic pathways of certain hormones  they serve as precursors  <cit> . carotenoids are also proposed to prevent cancer and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and alzheimer disease due to their antioxidative properties  <cit> . traditionally, terpenoids have been used in the feed, food and nutraceutical industries  <cit> . as the large-scale chemical synthesis of terpenoids is often difficult and/or costly due to their structural complexity  <cit>  and as their isolation from natural sources usually does not yield sufficient quantities  <cit> , microbial production processes offer a promising alternative.

carotenoids are derived from the universal precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate  and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate   <cit> . enhancing cellular metabolic flux toward ipp and dmapp is one strategy to improve rates and yield of microbial isoprenoid production  <cit> . there are two independent pathways leading to ipp: the mevalonic acid  pathway and the methylerythritol phosphate  pathway. the mva pathway is found in eukaryotes , archaea, and a limited number of bacteria. most bacteria as well as plant plastides synthesize ipp through the mep pathway  <cit> . the mva pathway requires acetyl-coa as the primary educt, whereas the mep pathway starts by condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate   <cit> .

corynebacterium glutamicum is used commercially for the annual production of more than  <dig> , <dig> tons of amino acids . the predominant carotenoids in c. glutamicum are the c50-terpene decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides  <cit> . to date, only three different c <dig> carotenoid biosynthetic pathways have been described: the biosynthetic pathways of the ɛ-cyclic c <dig> carotenoid decaprenoxanthin in c. glutamicum <cit> , the β-cyclic c <dig> carotenoid c.p.  <dig> in dietzia sp. cq <dig>  <cit>  and the γ-cyclic c <dig> carotenoid sarcinaxanthin in micrococcus luteus nctc <dig>  <cit> . in addition, only a few other corynebacteria have been identified to contain carotenoid pigments i.e. c. michiganense <cit> , c. erythrogenes <cit> , c. fascians <cit>  and c. poinsettiae <cit> . c. poinsettiae  e.g. is known to produce the c <dig> carotenoids bacterioruberin, bisanhydrobacterioruberin and c.p.  <dig>  <cit> . the genome of c. glutamicum encodes the enzymes of the mep pathway  <cit> . based on transposon mutant analysis and biochemical evidence c. glutamicum possesses a carotenogenic gene cluster encoding the responsible enzymes for the entire decaprenoxanthin biosynthesis starting from dmpp  <cit> . the immediate precursors of c <dig> and c <dig> carotenoids, farnesyl pyrophosphate  and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate , are generated from dmpp by prenyl transferase crte  <cit> . subsequently, phytoene synthase  condenses two ggpp molecules yielding the colorless carotenoid phytoene. four subsequent desaturation reactions by phytoene desaturase  yield the red-colored lycopene  <cit> . the elongation of lycopene with dmpp to the acyclic c <dig> carotenoid flavuxanthin is catalyzed by the crteb gene product lycopene elongase. the cyclization of flavuxanthin to decaprenoxanthin is catalyzed by heterodimeric carotenoid -ɛ-cyclase, encoded by crtye and crtyf <cit> . while mono- and diglucosylated decaprenoxanthin can be found in c. glutamicum, the genes and enzymes for glucosylation of decaprenoxanthin are still unknown  <cit> .

in this study, gene-directed deletion mutagenesis was employed to decipher the functions of the genes present in the main carotenogenic gene cluster of c. glutamicum and in a second cluster encoding putative phytoene synthase and phytoene desaturase paralogs. moreover, the potential of c. glutamicum to produce carotenoids was estimated by metabolic engineering of the conversion of ggpp to lycopene.

RESULTS
bioinformatical analysis of the carotenogenic genes
the genome of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  encodes genes showing homology to carotenoid biosynthesis genes in two gene clusters that are separated by almost  <dig> mbp. the larger cluster is composed of seven genes, crte , cg <dig> , crtb , crti , crtye, crtyf  and crteb  . the second cluster consists of a gene putatively encoding phytoene synthase  and two genes with similarity to an n-terminal fragment  and a c-terminal fragment  of phytoene desaturase/dehydrogenase .

the cluster crtb2/crti2-1/crti2- <dig> has not yet been analyzed. while crtb and crtb <dig> share 49% identity, crti2- <dig> shares 49% identical amino acids with the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of crti and crti2- <dig> 63% identical amino acids with the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of crti. thus, it is not clear whether crti2- <dig> and crti2- <dig> function as a two-subunit phytoene desaturase or whether a frameshift mutation disrupted the gene downstream of crtb <dig> 

a comparison of the sequenced genomes of corynebacteria  revealed that c. glutamicum wt is the only species possessing two crtb and crti like genes, while the organization of the large gene cluster is comparable in c. glutamicum wt, c. glutamicum r  and c. efficiens ys- <dig>  in c. glutamicum r, no crtyeyf is annotated as likely a g- > t mutation at position  <dig> of the c. glutamicum r genome altered the start codon of an open reading frame coding for a protein with 99% amino acid identity to crtyeyf of c. glutamicum wt to a leucine codon.

a second group of corynebacterial species  only possess the clustered genes crtb and crti . an intermediate situation is found in c. lipophiloflavum, which possesses a gene cluster with crtb, crti, crtye/f and crteb, as well as in c. genitalium possessing crtb, crti and crtye/f but lacking crteb . members of a third group  also lack crtye/f and crteb orthologs, but possess crtb and crti, however not clustered. although the overall amino acid sequence identities of the crtb and crti gene products are below 50% as compared to the respective crtb and crti from c. glutamcium wt, their domain structure includes the crti domain  as well as an n-terminal nad-binding rossmann-like domain . as an exception, c. variabile only possesses crti with an amino acid identity to crti from c. glutamicum wt of 58%.

the phylogeny of the crti gene product , which is present in all analysed corynebacteria, is congruent to the grouping of cornyebacterial species with respect to occurrence and clustering of crt genes as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> 

analysis of the transcriptional organization of the carotenogenic gene clusters
annotation of the carotenogenic gene cluster of the c. glutamicum wt for the biosynthesis of decaprenoxanthin from the precursor ggpp suggests co-transcription of crtb, crti, crtye and crtyf and crteb, while the upstream ggpp synthase gene crte appears to be monocistronic. to characterize the transcriptional organization of this cluster rt-pcr experiments have been carried out. pcr analysis of cdna synthesized from total rna of the c. glutamicum wt using primer crteb-rv  revealed that the entire gene cluster is co-transcribed since fragments overlapping adjacent genes could be amplified in each case. a cdna preparation without the addition of reverse transcriptase served as a negative control .

similarly, rt-pcr analysis of the small gene cluster revealed that crtb <dig>  crti2- <dig> and crti2- <dig> are co-transcribed. figure 3b displays the amplificate of a fragment overlapping crtb <dig> and crti2- <dig> based on cdna generated by reverse transcription using the crti-rv primer.

to determine the transcriptional start point  of crte and crtb <dig>  respectively, rna was isolated from c. glutamicum wt grown in lb complex medium. by use of 5’ race_pcr, the tsp of crte was identified as a guanosine  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the first nucleotide of the atg start codon. the three most conserved nucleotides of the consensus − <dig> hexamer of c. glutamicum promoters  <cit>  can be found in the − <dig> to − <dig> region. the − <dig> to − <dig> region contains a sequence motif sharing four identical nucleotides to − <dig> consensus. the tsp of crtb <dig> was determined as a guanosin thirteen nucleotides upstream of the first nucleotide of the start codon gtg. the hexamer taaagt at position − <dig> to − <dig> relative to the tsp matches the three most conserved bases of the tanant consensus sequence of the − <dig> region of c. glutamicum promoters  <cit> . at position − <dig> to − <dig> the hexamer ttgtct was found, which resembles the key recognition motif for the − <dig> region of c. glutamicum promoters ttgnca  <cit> .

gene deletion and complementation analysis of the carotenogenic gene clusters in c. glutamicum
gene-directed deletion mutants of c. glutamicum wt lacking crtb, crti, crteb, or crtyeyf were constructed and characterized regarding carotenoid production. besides the single deletion mutants, strain c. glutamicum ΔΔ lacking crtb, crti, crteb, and crtyeyf as well as the putative paralogs crtb <dig>  crti2- <dig> and crti2- <dig> was constructed. all strains showed growth rates of about  <dig>  h- <dig> in cgxii minimal medium with  <dig> mm glucose as carbon source. thus, growth was comparable to c. glutamicum wt. however, pigment accumulation differed between the various strains . the different composition of carotenoids in the cell extracts could be demonstrated by hplc analyses . the spectrophotometric analysis of the methanolic cell extracts of the c. glutamicum wt showed the characteristic absorption maxima at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nm for the yellow decaprenoxanthin, whereas the spectra of the pale red-colored c. glutamicum strains Δcrteb and Δcrty showed absorption maxima at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm .

the multiple deletion strain c. glutamicum ΔΔ  was used for stepwise reconstruction of the decaprenoxanthin biosynthetic pathway. expression of crtb and crti in the white strain c. glutamicum ΔΔ entailed a pale pink cell color and accumulation of lycopene was observed in cell extracts. additional expression of crteb entailed an orange cell color and accumulation of flavuxanthin. when crtyeyf was expressed additionally, a color comparable to that of the wild type was observed and the hplc chromatograms of the cell extracts were comparable to those of the wild type. thus, expression of crtb, crti, crteb, crtye and crtyf in the multiple deletion strain was sufficient to allow for decaprenoxanthin biosynthesis.

this finding was supported by analysis of the single gene deletion strains. each deletion mutant could be complemented by ectopic expression of the respective gene deleted in the chromosome . the mutant Δcrty lacking the final reaction in the synthesis of decaprenoxanthin, i.e. introduction of two ɛ-ionone groups into the acyclic flavuxanthin catalyzed by gene products of crtyeyf, accumulated flavuxanthin and exhibited a pale orange to red color. in the absence of the penultimate enzyme reaction of decaprenoxanthin biosynthesis, i.e. prenylation of lycopene to flavuxanthin by lycopene elongase, in the mutant Δcrteb, lycopene accumulated and neither flavuxanthin nor decaprenoxanthin were observed . accordingly, mutants Δcrtb lacking phytoene synthase and Δcrti lacking phytoene desaturase showed white cell color and Δcrti accumulated phytoene, which absorbs light at wavelengths below  <dig> nm. taken together, our gene deletion and complementation analysis corroborates previous biochemical and transposon mutagenesis data and results from heterologous gene expression regarding the functions of the enzymes encoded by crtb, crti, crteb, crtye and crtyf.

the function of the putative crtb paralogous gene crtb <dig> and of the putative crti paralogous genes crti2- <dig> and crti2- <dig> has not yet been analyzed. as hardly any phytoene was detectable in Δcrtb, but faint quantities of other carotenogenic intermediates were observed, crtb appears to be the major phytoene synthase active under the chosen conditions. similarly, the lack of the red chromophore lycopene in Δcrti indicated that crti is the only active phytoene desaturase. by contrast, a deletion mutant lacking the paralogous genes crtb <dig>  crti2- <dig> and crti2- <dig> showed the same yellow phenotype as c. glutamicum wt and the cell extracts showed the identical elution pattern in the hplc analysis. moreover, deletion mutants lacking crtb2i2-1i2- <dig> and either crtb or crti grew like wild type and showed the same white phenotype as the crtb and crti single deletion mutants. thus, the paralogous genes annotated as crtb <dig> and crti2- <dig> and crti2- <dig> are either not functional or not expressed  under the chosen conditions.

complementation analysis of the deletion mutants Δcrtb and Δcrti was chosen to test whether crtb <dig> and/or crti2-1/ <dig> encode functional enzymes. overexpression of crtb <dig> almost completely complemented the crtb deletion and as hplc analysis of extracts from c. glutamicum Δcrtb indicated accumulation of decaprenoxanthin crtb <dig> encodes a functional phytoene synthase . by contrast, overexpression of crti2-1/ <dig> in c. glutamicum Δcrti did not restore the wild-type phenotype while overexpression of crti did. furthermore, while combined expression of crtb <dig> and crti in c. glutamicum strain ΔΔ led to an accumulation of lycopene, the combined expression of crtb <dig> and crti2-1/ <dig> did not . thus, whereas no evidence for crti2-1/ <dig> encoding a phytoene desaturase was found, crtb <dig> encodes an enzyme active as phytoene synthase.

enhancing lycopene production by overexpression of carotenogenic genes in the lycopene accumulating strain c. glutamicum Δcrteb
the deletion of the gene crteb entailed accumulation of lycopene to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g cdw in c. glutamicum. to enhance the production of lycopene we focused on improving conversion of ggpp to lycopene. overexpression of the phytoene synthase gene crtb and/or the phytoene desaturase gene crti in c. glutamicum Δcrteb  was tested. whereas crti overexpression showed no effect on lycopene production , it could be shown that lycopene accumulation was increased two-fold when crtb was overexpressed . however, combined overexpression of both genes did not increase the lycopene content significantly .

besides overexpression of crtb, also overexpression of crte which codes for the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatase catalyzing the condensation of ipp and dmpp eventually leading to ggpp , increased lycopene production . as a consequence of overproduction of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatase in c. glutamicum Δcrteb, lycopene accumulated to four-fold higher concentrations . the combined overexpression of crtb and crte resulted in about  <dig> fold higher lycopene accumulation  as compared to c. glutamicum Δcrteb. the maximal lycopene concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g cdw was achieved when all three enzymes, crte, crtb and crti, were overproduced. thus, after de-bottlenecking the crte reaction overexpression of crtb and crti is beneficial for lycopene overproduction. the maximal lycopene accumulation was  <dig> fold higher than that of the empty vector control.

lycopene production was associated with less biomass formation and slowed glucose consumption. in this regard the strain with the highest lycopene production, c. glutamicum Δcrteb, stood out. the cells reached the stationary phase after  <dig> h, exhausted glucose not before  <dig> h after inoculation and grew only to about half of the biomass concentration  as compared to the empty vector control .

discussion
the synthesis of c <dig> carotenoids occurs in a restricted number of bacterial species. decaprenoxanthin is the most abundant one and it is the predominant carotenoid of the yellow c. glutamicum. the gene deletion and complementation analysis along with the pathway reconstruction in the multiple deletion strain c. glutamicum ΔΔ corroborates the previous elucidation of decaprenoxanthin biosynthesis in c. glutamicum based on transposon mutants of the strain mj233c  <cit>  and on heterologous expression of genes of the crte-cg0722-crtbiyeyfeb cluster in the non-carotenogenic host escherichia. coli <cit> . furthermore, we have analyzed a hitherto uncharacterized putative second carotenogenic gene cluster of c. glutamicum, crtb2/crti2-1/crti2- <dig>  regarding the c <dig> carotenoid production. for the second phytoene synthase-like gene, crtb <dig> , annotated in the c. glutamicum genome  <cit>  and postulated to be involved in the squalene synthesis  <cit> , we provide evidence that crtb <dig> indeed codes for a functional phytoene synthase. hence, c. glutamicum possesses two functional phytoene synthases, crtb and crtb <dig>  the two other open reading frames in the small crt-cluster are annotated as n- and c-terminal units of a second phytoene desaturase, but experimental confirmation of a phytoene desaturase function could not be obtained. within the genus corynebacterium c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> is the only species that possesses a second set of crt genes. the gc content of  <dig> to 58% of the second crt cluster is similar to the overall gc content of the genome, whereas that of the larger cluster is slightly lower. the genes of the two phytoene synthase paralogs only share 51% identity on the nucleotide level and mobile genetic elements such as is-elements could not be detected in the vicinity of the two clusters arguing against recent duplication or horizontal gene transfer events.

all genome-sequenced corynebacterial species possess a crti ortholog and most  also possess a crtb ortholog, either clustered with crti or elsewhere in the genome. the phylogeny of the crti gene product reflects the phylogeny of the species. only the highly related species c. glutamicum and c. efficiens exhibit all genes necessary to form c <dig> carotenoids. for corynebacterial species lacking some of the crt genes it remains to be shown if and which carotenoids are synthesized. on the other hand, c. michiganense <cit> , c. erythrogenes <cit> , c. fascians <cit>  and c. poinsettiae <cit>  are known to synthesize carotenoids, but their genome sequences are unknown.

in this study it could be shown that the genes of the carotenoid gene cluster of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> crte-cg0722-crtbiyeyfeb are co-transcribed. similarly, also the second cluster is transciptionally organized as an operon. transcriptional regulation of both operons has not yet been reported. the in vivo activity of the crtb <dig> gene product appears low due either to low expression levels or to low catalytic activity as plasmid-borne overexpression was required to complement the phenotype of the deletion mutant lacking the paralog crtb. currently, it remains unknown whether crtb <dig> expression is affected by environmental stimuli and if/how the function of the two paralogs is regulated.

the potential of c. glutamicum for overproduction of carotenoids is to our knowledge described here for the first time. the interest in production of carotenoids, which find application in a wide variety of products due to their antioxidative properties and their colors, by cost-effective, environmentally friendly microbial fermentation processes is steadily increasing. the carotenogenic c. glutamicum is generally recognized as safe , can readily be metabolically engineered and has been safely used in the million-ton-scale production of food-additives since more than  <dig> years  <cit> . lycopene was chosen as a test carotenoid product as it may serve as a platform intermediate and as its red color serves as a simple read out. lycopene is a commercial product obtained by fermentation with the fungus blakeslea trispora <cit>  . here we show that c. glutamicum overproduces lycopene if crteb is deleted and that additional overexpression of the carotenogenic genes crte, crtb and crti boosted lycopene production  <dig> fold. the achieved lycopene concentration of  <dig>  mg/g cdw is already comparable to that obtained with other popular biotechnological hosts like e. coli, for which e.g. a lycopene yield of  <dig>  mg/g cdw was reported when the crte, crtb and crti genes of the plant pathogen pantoea ananatis were overexpressed  <cit> . a higher lycopene concentration  could only be achieved in an e. coli strain overexpressing genes for ipp synthesis and carotenogenesis after a systematic screen identified three gene knockouts in the central carbon metabolism  <cit> . in e. coli harboring multiple modifications, i.e. carrying a plasmid with genes of the lycopene biosynthetic pathway  and a plasmid containing the entire heterologous mva pathway as well as the ipp isomerase gene, idi, and overexpressing the endogenous dxs gene, a lycopene concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/g was obtained in batch culture  <cit> . process engineering as fed-batch process with glycerol with  <dig> g/l glucose and  <dig>  g/l arabinose boosted the lycopene concentration to  <dig> mg/g cdw  <cit> .

the very good lycopene concentration obtained by c. glutamicum after engineering only the final three enzymatic steps of lycopene synthesis can likely be further enhanced by additional metabolic engineering of  ipp synthesis using the endogenous mep pathway and/or the heterologous mva pathway,  genome-based or computational approaches to identify target genes in the central metabolism or its regulation and  by process engineering using e.g. fed-batch protocols. thus, c. glutamicum may serve as a suitable production host for lycopene and related carotenoids.

in addition, c. glutamicum is a natural producer of the relatively rare group of c <dig> carotenoids that feature strong antioxidative properties due to the multiple conjugated double bonds and the hydroxyl group  <cit> . the pharmaceutical potential of these c <dig> carotenoids is not yet well studied  <cit> . it is imaginable that decaprenoxanthin, its direct precursor flavuxanthin or the c <dig> carotenoid of micrococcus luteus, sarcinaxanthin, could be of commercial interest. notably, genes of c. glutamicum and of m. luteus have been used to engineer e. coli for the production of sarcinaxanthin  <cit> . thus, the product range of structurally diverse c <dig> carotenoids could be accessible by engineered hosts including c. glutamicum.

CONCLUSIONS
the genes of the carotenoid gene cluster of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> crte-cg0722-crtbiyeyfeb are co-transcribed and encode the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the c <dig> carotenoid decaprenoxanthin. an alternative, functionally active phytoene synthase is encoded in the crtb2/crti2-1/crti2- <dig> operon leading to a certain degree of redundancy in carotenoid synthesis in c. glutamicum. the potential of c. glutamicum as production host for terpenoids in general was demonstrated by considerable lycopene production after engineering the terminal reactions leading to lycopene.
