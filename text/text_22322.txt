BACKGROUND
methods for transcriptome analysis are today diversified and can be divided in two families of technologies: "closed" and "open" techniques  <cit> . in closed technologies such as microarrays, the space of inquiry is finite since the analysis of the expression level is limited to previously characterized transcript sequences for which a corresponding probe was spotted on the microarray. in contrary, open technologies analyze the transcriptome without any a priori knowledge on the transcript sequences. these methods thus allow the discovery of new transcribed sequences  <cit> . this is particularly interesting as all transcribed sequences have not been discovered yet, even in well studied species like mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit> .

the most widely used methods for open transcriptome analysis are based on the sequencing of either cdnas  or of short tag sequences. this later strategy has been developed in serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , longsage  <cit>  and massively parallel signature sequencing   <cit> . they are by construction much more efficient in sampling the depth of the transcriptome than the est sequencing techniques. in contrast to the  <dig> bp sage tags generated by sage, the  <dig> bp tags obtained either by longsage or mpss can directly be mapped to the genome sequence, which is particularly interesting for the identification of new transcribed sequences  <cit> .

today, the new challenge of gene expression analysis is the deep analysis of transcriptomes in order to investigate the role of weakly expressed genes that can nevertheless play an important role in different biological processes. a recent study revealed that millions of transcript tags have to be sequenced in order to fully characterize a human transcriptome . in this respect, the mpss technique is particularly interesting as its bead-based sequencing technology allows to sequence simultaneously more than one million of tags in a library. this is therefore far more efficient and faster than the sequencing of a longsage library by the sanger method. however, recent publication shows that mpss libraries are significantly less complex than much smaller longsage libraries, revealing a serious bias in the generation of mpss data .

it is therefore of great interest to design a new method combining a tag-based technique such as longsage with a high throughput sequencing technology in order to perform deep transcriptome analysis and explore the large complexity of the transcriptome. a first combination of sage and  <dig> sequencing, called deepsage, has been published  and leads to both increased sensitivity and less tedious library preparation . however, although deepsage allows the counting of more than  <dig>  tags, it is still based on creation of ditags  <cit> . we propose that the cost-effectiveness solexa sequencing technology  <cit> , which allows to sequence millions of short cdna of  <dig> bp per sample, would lead to another major advance by still reducing the library construction time and increasing the sensitivity .

we therefore built up a library of male adult mice hypothalamus, a brain region involved in behavioral and autonomic coordination, using longsage and solexa sequencing technologies. in order to assess if we can properly explore the transcriptome complexity with this method, we compared this library with a longsage library of mouse hypothalamus sequenced with the sanger method. we found that, for the same number of tags, a comparable and even slightly higher level of complexity of transcriptome is uncovered with longsage combined with the solexa technology than with the sanger method. therefore, the combination of longsage and solexa sequencing seems to be perfectly suited for deep transcriptome analysis.

RESULTS
major characteristics of the two libraries
two libraries were created from male adult mice hypothalamus, collected bilaterally as punches centered on the perifornical nucleus from the caudal part of the paraventricular nucleus to the mammillary bodies . a first library was constructed by using the longsage method combined with the sanger sequencing technology , and a second library with the longsage method combined with the solexa sequencing technology  . major characteristics of both libraries are summarized in table  <dig> 

* we consider that a tag matches to the genome if it has 100% identity over its whole length .

the solexa_hypo library is  <dig> fold deeper  than the sanger_hypo library . far more unique tags were therefore obtained in the solexa_hypo library  than in the sanger_hypo one  . with both the sanger and the solexa techniques, a very high percent of the sequenced tags matched to the mouse genome . this proportion is higher than a previous estimation  computed by estimating the proportion of erroneous tags in longsage libraries  <cit> . this could be due to our consideration of the base-call quality during the extraction of tags from concatemer sequences . nevertheless, it is to keep in mind that the proportion of tags that do not match to the genome is an over-estimation of the proportion of the erroneous tags. indeed, several tags without errors do not match to the genome because they overlap two exons, extend into the polya tail or contain polymorphic positions  <cit> . furthermore, the probability that an erroneous tag match to the genome has been estimated to be very low  <cit> . consequently, the tag sequences obtained in both solexa_hypo and sanger_hypo libraries seem to be of excellent quality, and the overall quality of the solexa_hypo tags seems to be slightly better than the sanger_hypo ones.

one could argue that the better score obtained with solexa_hypo is due to the fact that this library is created from c57bl/ <dig> mice, the same mice strain that has been used to sequence the mouse genome while the sanger_hypo library come from fvb mice. it is probably partly valid. however, sandberg et al  <cit>  have estimated at 1% the number of tags that are different between  <dig> mouse strains. furthermore, we estimated the percent of tags that match with one mismatch on the c57bl6/j genome to be of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the sanger_hypo and the solexa_hypo libraries respectively. this is a very low percentage, thereby confirming the very low probability that an erroneous tag matches to the genome. this percentage is only slightly higher for sanger_hypo indicating that the better score obtained with solexa_hypo is not only due to strain differences.

to validate the procedure of tissue collection, we looked at genes known to be absent in the hypothalamus but expressed in adjacent brain area such as the thalamus or the midbrain. location was verified using the allen brain atlas of gene expression in mouse  <cit> . we selected the nmda nr2c, the chloride channel calcium activated  <dig> and the sodium voltage gated type v alpha. none of them were found in the sanger_hypo or the solexa_hypo libraries. as libraries were constructed from two different hypothalamic samples, two different strains of mice and an amplification step was added for the built-up of the solexa_hypo library , a direct comparison of the level of expression of selected genes is meaningless. we nevertheless checked for the expression level of  <dig> well-known genes of the hypothalamus, the pro-melanin concentrating hormone , preprohypocretin  and prodynorphin  and found that in both libraries  and with q-pcr, the level of expression of pmch is remarkably higher than hcrt that is greatly elevated compare to pdyn . this demonstrates the overall agreement between those three techniques.

since both libraries have been generated from the same tissue, we were however able to compared the distribution of tag occurrence between the two libraries. this distribution is highly similar between sanger_hypo and solexa_hypo libraries . a high proportion of tags is present in only one copy in the sanger_hypo library  while they represent only 32% of the tags of the solexa_hypo library , confirming that the depth of sequencing of the sanger_hypo library is not sufficient. it has been previously reported  <cit>  that the distribution of large scale expression data is skewed by many low abundance transcripts. this has lead to the conclusion that all genes are expressed in all cells  <cit> , although at a very low abundance, a process also known as «illegitimate transcription»  <cit> . furthermore, we are dealing with populations of cells, harboring stochasticity detectable at the single-cell transcriptome level  <cit> . finally, one also knows that part of the tags with a count of one is simply sequencing errors. taken together, all those reasons are probably combined to produce the "classical" transcriptome profile displayed on figure  <dig>  which never shows its finite nature.

when we consider all unique tags from the two libraries combined,  <dig> % of these tags are found in both libraries,  <dig> % are found only in the solexa_hypo library, and  <dig> % are found only in the sanger_hypo library. as one would expect, the mean occurrence number of the  <dig> % common tags is higher  than the mean occurrence number of all tags  in both libraries. furthermore, if we select the  <dig> most abundant unique tags from both libraries , the number of unique tags found in both libraries is greatly increased . these data confirm that the depth of sequencing of the sanger_hypo library is not sufficient to sample the tags present in the initial hypothalamic sample. the  <dig> % of tags found uniquely in the sanger_hypo library might be mostly due to mouse strain differences .

depth of sampling
to analyze the depth of transcriptome sampling in the sanger_hypo and solexa_hypo libraries, we studied the rate of increase of the number of unique tags identified as the size of the corresponding library increases . as shown in figure 5a, this rate of increase is still high, even when the library size reached the total number of tags in the sanger_hypo library. this suggests that we are far from having distinguished each potential tag sequence of the initial hypothalamic sample. in contrary, the rate of increase of the number of unique tags identified decline drastically as we consider several millions of tags from the solexa_hypo library .

theoretically, this rate should equal zero if all unique tags of the initial hypothalamus sample had been sampled. however, it could be slightly greater because the addition of new tags could be due to the accumulation of different sequencing errors as the size of the library increases. we thus calculated the number of unique tags that matches to the genome in each of the random sampled libraries . as the probability that an erroneous tag matches to the genome is very low  <cit> , this set of matching tags should contains almost only reliable tags. there is a smaller increase of the number of unique tags identified as the size of the library increases when we only consider matching tags than when we consider all tags . moreover, the dotted line in the figure 3a confirms that the size of the sanger_hypo library does not sample all unique tags from the initial hypothalamic sample. in contrary, it seems that we have almost sampled all different tags in the solexa_hypo library since the rate of discovery of new unique tags is severely dropping as the size increases: with a library size of one million, we were able to identify only one third of the unique tags  whereas 80% of these tags were identified with a library of  <dig> millions of tags, and the vast majority  in a  <dig> millions tags library ."

complexity of the transcriptome
increasing sequencing depth is only valuable if it gives access to a better image of the transcriptome complexity . we therefore compared the transcriptome complexity for the same random library sizes in the sanger_hypo and in the solexa_hypo sage libraries  and found that longsage combined either with sanger or with solexa sequencing gives access to similar transcriptome complexity. the number of unique tags identified in the solexa_hypo library is even slightly larger than the one in the sanger_hypo library .

hene et al.  <cit>  showed that at a same sampling depth, a longsage library of human t cells sequenced with the sanger method contains much more unique tags than a mpss library of t-cells . when we consider the same library size as hene and colleagues, we sampled  <dig>  unique tags matching to the mouse genome from the solexa_hypo library. although a significant part of this difference may be accounted to the higher complexity of the hypothalamic sample used for the sanger_hypo and solexa_hypo libraries compared to the t cell sample used by hene et al.  <cit> , it does not explain it all. it rather advocates that longsage – solexa does not have the limitation of mpss in its ability to explore the transcriptome complexity. indeed, at a same sampling depth of  <dig>  tags, considering only tags that match the genome, we found  <dig>  unique tags in the sanger_hypo library and  <dig>  unique tags in the solexa_hypo library , suggesting an ability of longsage – solexa to uncover more transcriptome complexity than longsage – sanger method.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study shows that the solexa sequencing technology is well adapted to the sequencing of longsage tags, allowing to rapidly obtain a very deep longsage library without the complexity limitation observed in mpss libraries. the combination of longsage and solexa sequencing technology is therefore perfectly suited for deep transcriptome analysis.
