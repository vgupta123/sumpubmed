BACKGROUND
yam  is an important tuber crop valued for its dietary carbohydrate, amino acids and essential minerals. it is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. most d. alata tubers have white flesh, but occasionally, purple-flesh tubers with high anthocyanidin content are produced because of spontaneous variation  <cit> . anthocyanins are responsible for the deep purple to red pigmentation of various flowers, fruits, leaves, and other plant tissues  <cit> . anthocyanins are perhaps the best characterized flavonoids with studies indicating their important role in plant physiology, in particular, plant defense against herbivores and pathogens. they have also been shown to have multiple health benefits for humans including immunomodulatory, anticancer, cardio-protective, vasodilation, antithrombotic, and uv-protection due to their antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . therefore, it is no surprise that the purple-flesh yam tubers have recently been selling at a premium price owing to consumer awareness about its health benefits. the current study is aimed at understanding how spontaneous variation leads to anthocyanin synthesis in certain yam strains. understanding the molecular mechanism of triggering anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in these strains makes it possible to transfer the purple pigment trait to conventional white-flesh cultivar, thus improving the tuber quality and market value.

in the past decade, the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway  has been well characterized genetically and biochemically in model and non-model plants  <cit> ; and a number of genes encoding important enzymes and transcription factors responsible for the fbp have been cloned from a dozen organisms such as arabidopsis  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , petunia  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . nevertheless, the complicated mechanism that controls anthocyanin catabolism in different plant species and tissues is far from conclusive. it is reasonable to expect that the loss or accumulation-of-color adaptations in yams are relatively unconstrained because they can be obtained in various ways  <cit> , and affected by multiple intracellular factors such as co-pigmentation  <cit> , ph  <cit>  and metal-chelation in vacuoles  <cit> . the promotion or suppression of any one of the enzymes catalyzing a series of reactions that make up a pathway will change its final product. for example, chen et al.  <cit>  found that for independent events causing accumulation of red pigments in variegated peach flowers, a particular subset of genes  were enhanced and co-regulated in the fbp. lou et al.  <cit>  also revealed that the loss of delphinidin  resulted from the gene suppression of fls and dfr in grape hyacinth.

recently, transcriptomic analysis based on next generation sequencing  technology has emerged as an extremely powerful method for identifying novel genes associated with biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites in non-model plant species  <cit> . specially, it has been widely applied to investigate molecular mechanisms of color variation in plant species such as blueberry  <cit> , grape  <cit> , brassica juncea  <cit> , and potato  <cit> . in yam, transcription profiles of leaf tissues from one anthracnose susceptible  and two resistant yam genotypes  were analyzed upon infection with the anthracnose fungus; a set of genes involved in defense against anthracnose were identified  <cit> . anthocyanins are considered as an important quality trait in yam  <cit> . however, to date, no effort has been made to uncover molecular basis of different color formation in yam tubers by using rna-seq. a previous study by zhou et al.  <cit>  through race technology and rt-pcr analysis, reported that daans <dig>  controls anthocyanin accumulation of purple-flesh tubers based on its regulation at transcription level. however, a limitation in this study was the use of single cultivar  and study of one gene . without comparing the global transcriptional differences between the purple-flesh cultivar and conventional white-flesh cultivar, it is impossible to separate candidate genes related to color formation. therefore, the molecular mechanism underlying the purple-flesh formation has not yet been fully understood in yam.

further, being a non-model species, there is lack of genomic resources, in particular, information on ssr markers for marker-assisted breeding  of yam. previous genetic inheritance study revealed that some important traits  are controlled by a single dominant locus in yam  <cit> . genic-ssr markers appear to be tightly linked to specific gene functions and perhaps even play a direct role in controlling important traits  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated the variability in cultivated yam accessions in terms of tuber shape, color, taste and yield  <cit> . however, very limited knowledge is available on the genetic regions associated with these variations, in particular ssr or snp markers for important genes  <cit> . therefore, identification of ssr markers from yam transcriptome is crucial for the future of marker-assisted breeding programs.

here, we report use of rna-seq to investigate the transcriptomic differences between yam tubers of a purple-flesh cultivar  and conventional white-flesh cultivar . differentially expressed genes and their expression patterns were analyzed, and some potential candidate genes responsible for the fbp were successfully identified. we expect this genome-wide transcriptome comparison to provide a novel resource to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the purple-flesh trait. moreover, transcriptomic datasets were further exploited to identify a large number of gene-based ssr markers that enable linkage mapping and marker assisted breeding of yams.

RESULTS
sequencing statistics and assembly
the variation in pigment expression of the purple-flesh cultivar and the conventional white-flesh cultivar of yam is shown in figure  <dig>  to characterize the transcriptome differences between the two cultivars, two cdna libraries were prepared from their tubers and subjected to rna-seq analysis based on the illumina hisseq  <dig> platform. after removing adaptors and reads of unknown or low-quality nucleotides, in total,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were respectively obtained from the dp and dw libraries. the information of all high-quality reads has been deposited in the sequence read achieve  database under the accession id srx <dig> for dp, and srx <dig> for dw. the high-quality reads from the two libraries were subsequently de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes using trinity program; the size distribution of these unigenes is shown in additional file  <dig>  as a result, the in silico assembled unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp with an average length of 592 bp; the n <dig> value was 875 bp and total size was approximately  <dig>  mb. furthermore, in order to estimate the efficiency of short-read usage during the de novo assembling, we mapped our rna-seq reads to the assembled unigenes using tophat analysis package. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> sequences from dp and dw library respectively were matched  , indicating that the set of assembled unigenes is applicable to carry out the downstream analysis.figure  <dig> different pigment expression in yam tubers. a: elite purple-flesh cultivar; b: conventional white-flesh cultivar.

currently, the yam est library found in genbank database  contains  <dig>  ests from leaves of three genotypes differing in resistance to anthracnose disease  <cit> . to estimate the level of transcript coverage in this study, we downloaded these ests from genbank and compared them to our transcriptome unigenes using blastn . only  <dig> % ests  from genbank matched to  <dig>  unigenes . this was probably associated with different tissues used for transcriptome analysis. it also highlights the high level of sequencing depth achievable through ngs compared to low coverage obtained using conventional cdna library sequencing. furthermore,  <dig>  novel yam unigenes were discovered, some of which may be specifically expressed in yam tuber tissue. these novel unigenes may serve as a crucial genomic resource for future studies, such as gene identification, cloning and functional analysis.

annotation, functional classification and kegg pathway analysis of the unigenes
to acquire the most informative and complete annotation, all assembled unigene sequences were matched against the ncbi non-redundant protein , the arabidopsis thaliana protein dataset of nr , gene ontology , and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  by blastx . out of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   represented significant match to genes encoding proteins or putative function in at least one of these public databases , whereas  <dig> % unigenes could not be annotated to predicted coding regions with unknown functions in other species. in comparison with previous publications for yam and other non-model plant species  <cit> , the low rate of annotated unigenes indicated that assembled unigenes, particularly sequences without a significant homologous hit, were potentially novel gene sequences not yet reported in other crops.table  <dig>

for unigene sequences in the nr annotations, blast search analysis further revealed that a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  unigenes respectively matched with the sequences from vitis vinifera, oryza sativa, populus trichocarpa, zea mays, and ricinus communis with the highest homology . similar distributions were also observed for yam in previous study  <cit> . moreover, the identifying distribution pattern showed that  <dig> % of the sequences had a similarity higher than 80%, while  <dig> % showed a moderate similarity , and the remaining  <dig> % showed a lower similarity  .figure  <dig> sequence homology of yam tuber sequences blasted against ncbi non-redundant  database. a: species distribution of the top blast hits; b: similarity distribution of top blast hits for each unigene.



when describing the properties of genes and their products, their functional classification is the most important. in this study, go functional analysis was performed using blast2go to characterize all assembled unigenes; the result is shown in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  unigenes were classified into  <dig> functional terms, including  <dig> terms in biological process,  <dig> terms in cellular component, and  <dig> terms in molecular function. within biological process, “cellular process”  with  <dig>  unigenes and “metabolic process”  with  <dig>  unigenes were predominant. under the cellular component, the “cell” , “cell part” , and “organelle”  represented the majority of this category. similarly, for molecular function, the terms of “binding”  and “catalytic activity”  were the most abundant assigned terms. these go annotations demonstrated that the unigenes expressed in yam tuber encode diverse structural, regulatory and stress response proteins.figure  <dig> gene ontology  functional annotation of unigenes. all  <dig>  unigenes are classified into  <dig> functional terms:  <dig> terms in biological process,  <dig> terms in cellular component, and  <dig> terms in molecular function.



furthermore, all annotated unigene sequences were matched against cluster of orthologous groups  database to predict and classify possible functions. out of  <dig>  nr hits, a total of  <dig>  sequences with cog annotations were assigned into  <dig> cog categories . the “general function prediction only” category represented the largest group , followed by “posttranslational modification”, “protein turnover and chaperones” , “signal transduction mechanisms” , “replication, recombination and repair”  and “transcription” , and only one sequence was assigned into extracellular structures.figure  <dig> cog function classification of the yam tuber transcriptome. a total of  <dig>  unigenes showing significant homology to the cogs database within ncbi  were classified into  <dig> categories.



in addition, to identify which metabolic pathways were enriched, a pathway-based analysis was conducted through the kegg pathway database using blastx with an e-value cutoff of <10− <dig>  in total,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the result reveals that metabolic pathway  was the most enriched , followed by biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  and microbial metabolism in diverse environments . the focus of this study was differential anthocyanin accumulation in the dp cultivar. therefore, genes associated with two secondary metabolic pathways including flavonoid biosynthesis, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis were separately analyzed. a total of  <dig> genes were found to be directly or indirectly involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, and they were mapped and highlighted in this pathway  . in contrast, relatively few genes  were found to encode key enzymes in the flavone and flavonol biosynthesis  . overall, these findings provide useful information to further uncover the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation in yam tuber.

identification of differentially expressed genes  in yam tubers of the purple-flesh and white-flesh cultivars
to profile gene expression, the expression levels were measured as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped , with fpkm values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . as a result,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were discovered in the dp and dw libraries, respectively. among them,  <dig>  unigenes specifically expressed in the tuber of dp,  <dig>  unigenes only expressed in the dw, and  <dig>  unigenes expressed in both cultivars. this indicated that some unique genes may play an important role in the accumulation of purple pigment.

based on the false discovery rate  ≤  <dig> , and fold change  ≥  <dig>   <dig> degs were identified from the two libraries, among which  <dig> genes were up-regulated, and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in dp versus dw. for a detailed comparison, see additional file  <dig>  there were more up-regulated genes than down-regulated ones, suggesting that many genes were positively regulated for biosynthesis of anthocyanins. similar results were also reported in other species  <cit> . annotation of differentially expressed unigenes revealed that  <dig> unigenes were grouped into  <dig> go groups while the remaining  <dig> unigenes could not be classified . the most common categories were “intracellular part”  and “protein binding” , followed by “cellular macromolecule metabolic process”, and “intracellular organelle”.

identification of candidate genes associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway
flavonoids are a class of important secondary metabolites including hydroxycinnamic acids, isoflavones, flavonols, phlobaphenes, pro-anthocyanidins and anthocyanins. in our annotated yam transcriptome, multiple unigenes of encoding almost all known enzymes associated with biosnythesis of anthocyanin and its derivatives in the fbp were identified .table  <dig>

as shown in figure  <dig>  flavonoids are initially derived from cinnamate and converted to chalcone via the phenylpropanoid pathway by cinnamate 4-monooxygenase   and chs . subsequently, chi  catalyzes the stereo-specific cyclization of chalcones into naringenin. furthermore, naringenin can be converted through f3h  and f3’h  to produce dihydroxyflavonols including dihydrokaempferol  and dihydroquercetin . these flavanones serve as the lead compounds for conversion into almost all flavonoids. following the above reaction, dfr  further catalyzes the divergent conversion of dihydroflavonols to produce colorless procyanidins including leucopelargonidin, and leucocyanidin. they are the direct precursors for production of colored anthocyanidins  by lodx  catalysis. in the end, two glucosyltransferases  catalyze the glucosylation of anthocyanidins to produce stable molecules of the fbp. notably, the formation of  -epiflavan 3-ols  is also achieved by a two-step conversion of leucoanthocyanidin by leucoanthocyanidin reductase  and anthocyanidin reductase  , suggesting that flavonoid biosynthesis looks more like a complex metabolic grid than a linear pathway  <cit> .

considering the anthocyanin accumulation in purple-flesh tuber is associated with specific molecular functions, we compared the differences in gene expression profile of the purple and white flesh tubers to identify putative genes co-expressed with anthocyanin accumulation. among the above described genes involved in the fbp , one chs , one f3h , one dfr , one uf3gt , two f3’h , and two ldox  homologous sequences were significantly up-regulated in the purple-flesh tuber. in contrast, one o-methyltransferase  was significantly down-regulated. these up-regulated genes code for important proteins and their expression directly correlated with anthocyanin biosynthesis . for example in the upstream of the fbp, the up-regulated chs, f3h and f3’h in purple-flesh tubers can increase functional redundancies for forming primary precursor  and lead compounds  of all flavonoids. similar results were also observed during the differential pigment deposition in potato tubers  <cit> , peach and grape flowers  <cit> .

on the other hand, in the downstream of fbp, three up-regulated genes  also play a critical role during formation of colored anthocyanins. we found that dfr and ldox unigenes were not expressed in the white-flesh tubers, whereas two ldox unigenes were expressed at high levels in the purple-flesh tubers . in addition, the up-regulated glycosyltransferase  can potentially make structural modifications to anthocyanins. two anthocyanins  in the purple-flesh tuber are glycosylated at the 3-postion of the c-ring by this enzyme. similar results were also reported in previous studies  <cit> . for instance, two glycosyltransferases, ugt79b <dig> and ugt84a <dig> were found to cause high levels of anthocyanin modifications  in arabidopsis flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> , whilst anthocyanins were drastically reduced in the ugt79b <dig> and ugt84a <dig> knockout mutants. besides, the o-methyltransferase is one of the most important modification reactions of flavonoids and the resulting o-methylated flavonoids have been shown to display new biological activities  <cit> . in this study, the down-regulated o-methyltransferase  was assigned to code quercetin-3-o-methyltransferase protein and may have redundant function in the fbp. taken together, these results indicate that key genes responsible for the fbp have a higher expression level in the purple-flesh tubers of yam. this finding is an important explanation of well-known higher antioxidant activity in pigmented tissues found in a number of tissues.

identification of genes associated with transcription factors 
besides structural genes, it is well known that transcription factors play an essential role in regulating the overall activity of flavonoid biosynthesis. in most species, the anthocyanin branch within the fbp is controlled by a ternary complex of myb-bhlh-wd <dig> tfs  <cit> , which generally regulate expression of many structural genes. in our transcriptome database, a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> unigenes were respectively predicted to code bhlh, myb, and wd <dig> proteins including a large number of its members. of these genes, the transcriptomic analysis detected four tfs that were differentially expressed between the two cultivars of yam tubers, including three wd <dig> repeat proteins with one up-regulated  and two down-regulated  in purple-flesh tubers. further, one myb4r <dig> protein  was also found to be up-regulated in purple-flesh tubers . the high variation in expression of structural genes associated with the fbp in the purple-flesh tubers may most likely be regulated by one or more of these tfs. however, the specific function of these tfs in the fbp of yams still needs to be validated using a functional genomics approach.

gene validation and expression analysis
it was reported that several genes involved in the fbp showed special expression patterns in different species such as chs, f3h, dfr, ldox genes in brassica juncea seed coat  <cit> , solanum tuberosum l. tuber  <cit> , carthamus tinctorius l flower  <cit> , magnolia sprengeri pamp flower  <cit> . therefore, to experimentally confirm that the unigenes obtained in this study from transcriptome analysis were indeed differentially expressed, eight degs  associated with the fbp were chosen for real-time quantitative pcr assay. the expression profiles of these unigenes are shown in figure  <dig>  results showed that unigene  <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> , unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> , and unigene <dig>  were up-regulated in the purple-fleshed tuber of yam, which was well consistent with those observed by transcriptome analylsis . this result further confirms the reliability of rna-seq analysis.figure  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of eight differentially expressed unigenes associated with the fbp. error bars were calculated based on three replicates. ubc was used as an internal control for normalization. dw = white-flesh tuber; dp = purple-flesh tuber.



identification of simple sequence repeats  in yam
usually, gene-derived ssrs are more transferable between species than random genomic ssrs. this is perhaps because they are associated with functional genetic variation, as opposed to non-coding ssrs, with presence in transcribed regions potentially influencing gene function, transcription or translation  <cit> . in this study, transcriptome analysis of the two yam tuber cultivars  led to identification of  <dig>  ssrs within  <dig>  unigenes, of which,  <dig> sequences contained more than  <dig> ssr, and  <dig> ssrs were present in compound form. the observed frequency of unigenes was  <dig> % ; considering that approximately  <dig>  kb total size was analyzed, and least one ssr per  <dig>  kb could be detected in the expressed sequences of yam.

the motifs of  <dig>  ssrs contained  <dig>   dinucleotides,  <dig>   trinucleotides,  <dig>  tetranucleotides,  <dig>  pentanucleotides and  <dig>  hexaucleotides . the most abundant repeat type was ag/ct, followed by aag/ctt, and aaat/attt. further,  <dig>  ssr primer pairs were successfully designed using primer  <dig>  the details of the frequency of ssr motif and genic-ssr primers sequences  are summarized in additional file  <dig>  very recently, we revealed that chinese yam species have rich genetic diversity and phenotype traits including stable tuber yield, taste, texture, and dry matter content  <cit> . in comparison with previous study using roche  <dig> sequencing technology  <cit> , a larger number of new genic-ssr markers were developed in this study, and they may be closely linked to these qualitative traits. in the future, these functional gene-based markers, will make it possible to construct a high density linkage map or association map for identification of quantitative traits loci  associated with tuber quality traits in yams.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
the focus of this study was use of ngs-based illumina paired-end sequencing platform to characterize the gene expression differences between an elite purple-flesh tuber and conventional white-flesh tuber of yam. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were identified from the two cdna libraries, which will contribute significantly to further genome-wide research and analyses of this species and other related species. analysis of the transcriptome data revealed a number of candidate genes which are possibly involved in purple-flesh tuber formation. the candidates include not only structural genes such as chs, f3h, f3’h, dfr, ldox and uf3gt, but also some transcription factors  that potentially regulate development of purple-flesh in yam tubers. such knowledge can be used to genetically enhance tuber color of conventional white-flesh cultivar. in addition, we also used transcriptomic data as a resource to develop new ssr markers. these marker sets will facilitate identification of quantitative traits loci  associated with yam tuber quality in future.
