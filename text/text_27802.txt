BACKGROUND
ccr <dig>  the eotaxin receptor, is the major chemokine receptor expressed on eosinophils, basophils and a subpopulation of th <dig> lymphocytes  <cit> . recently, ccr <dig> has been shown to be upregulated on neutrophils and monocytoid u <dig> cells by interferons in vitro and to be expressed by endothelial cells, epithelial cells and mast cells  <cit> . the relevance of these findings and the function of ccr <dig> on non-leukocytes remain to be elucidated since the only cells that consistently accumulate following eotaxin administration in vivo are myeloid cells   <cit> .

to date, the complete mrna and genomic organization of only a limited number of chemokine receptors has been described  <cit> . these studies have shown that the 5' untranslated region  can be complex and contain up to  <dig> exons as in the cxcr <dig> gene. as a result, alternative splicing and transcription directed by multiple promoters can give rise to variable mrna isoforms. the function of these 5' untranslated exons has not been examined except for a single study focused on ccr <dig>  demonstrating a transcriptional role for exon  <dig>  <cit> . we have previously characterized the genomic structure and promoter function of the human ccr <dig> gene  <cit> . the ccr <dig> gene contains at least  <dig> exons that give rise to multiple mrna species by alternative splicing. the first  <dig>  kb of the 5' flanking region of exon  <dig> had strong promoter activity in eosinophilic, lymphoid and respiratory epithelial cell lines. deletion analysis revealed differential regulation of the ccr <dig> promoter in eosinophilic and epithelial cell lines suggesting the presence of lineage-specific elements. interestingly, exon  <dig> enhanced the activity of the promoter. since our initial characterization, two other groups have studied the ccr <dig> promoter  <cit> ; however, their studies focused on lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines, respectively, rather than eosinophils. scotet et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the human ccr <dig> promoter is active in vitro in lymphocytic cell lines. they also demonstrate a role for chromatin remodeling in the regulation of ccr <dig> expression in th <dig> cells. vijh et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the human ccr <dig> promoter is active in monocytic cell lines and defined the minimal promoter that consists of a downstream promoter element , a common element in drosophila genes, but rare in human genes. this element is upstream  of the exon  <dig> sequence studied in the current report.

it has been reported that 5' untranslated exons, and sometimes introns, can regulate the expression of genes in two different ways. an untranslated sequence can act as a tissue-specific translational regulator. a striking example is the gonadotropin releasing hormone gene which is transcribed in multiple tissue, but cannot be translated due to the lack of specific intron removal  <cit> . alternatively, untranslated regions  can facilitate transcription of a gene. examples include a gata- <dig> site in the 5'-utr of the γ-globin gene, an hnf- <dig> site in the plasminogen gene and a c/ebp site in the ccr <dig> gene  <cit> . while the mechanism of action is not completely clear, it is thought that transcription factors binding to untranslated regions affect transcription of the gene through interactions with the rna transcription complex. the role of untranslated exons in the ccr <dig> gene has not been studied. in this report, dnase i hypersensitivity identified a major hypersensitive site located in the vicinity of untranslated exon  <dig>  furthermore, the transcription factor gata- <dig> is shown to bind to untranslated exon  <dig>  suggesting a potential mechanism for the regulation of ccr <dig> transcription by this exon. finally, using a transgenic approach, we demonstrate that the  <dig>  kb 5' flanking region of ccr <dig>  has promoter activity in vivo.

RESULTS
dnase i hypersensitivity in the ccr <dig> locus
we aimed to define regulatory regions in the ccr <dig> gene by a gene-wide search. thus, we performed dnase i hypersensitivity of ccr <dig> in primary human eosinophils. the entire  <dig> kb of the ccr <dig> gene were screened for dnase i hypersensitivity using probes specific for eco ri and hind iii fragments . only one hypersensitive site was noted; this was in the area of exon  <dig> . similar results were obtained with nuclei from the eosinophilic aml <dig> d <dig> cell line . this cell line does not express ccr <dig> unless induced with butyric acid and il-5; suggesting that chromatin remodeling in the hs <dig> site precedes ccr <dig> transcription. thus, our analysis revealed areas of active chromatin remodeling in the vicinity of exon  <dig> suggesting that this area may be important for ccr <dig> transcription.

binding of nuclear proteins to exon  <dig> of the ccr <dig> gene
dnase i hypersensitivity indicated that a region consistent with exon  <dig> is active in ccr <dig> transcription. together with our previous data showing that untranslated exon  <dig> has an important role in ccr <dig> transcription  <cit> , we hypothesized that nuclear proteins bind to exon  <dig>  and in turn regulate the transcription of ccr <dig>  in order to test this hypothesis, a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe that corresponds to bp + <dig> to + <dig> of the ccr <dig> gene was prepared, referred to as e1-fl . this is the exact sequence that was deleted in the ccr <dig> pgl <dig> plasmid that demonstrated decreased activity compared to the full length  <dig>  kb construct  <cit> . nuclear extracts from aml <dig> d <dig> cells were incubated with the probe and resolved on a polyacrylamide gel. two bands were visible . the upper band was eliminated when 150x molar excess of the unlabelled probe was used , indicating that this is the specific band. in order to precisely localize the region responsible for factor binding, overlapping cold competitors were used: e1-a spanning from + <dig> to + <dig>  e1-b spanning from + <dig> to + <dig> and e1-c spanning from + <dig> to + <dig>  the specific band was eliminated with e1-b and e1-c cold competitors indicating that the factor binds in the region between + <dig> and + <dig> . in summary, these data indicate the presence of proteins in the nuclei of aml <dig> d <dig> cells that bind to ccr <dig> exon  <dig> between bp  <dig> and  <dig> 

binding of gata- <dig> to exon  <dig> of the ccr <dig> gene
in order to define the proteins capable of binding to ccr <dig> exon  <dig>  the exon  <dig> sequence was analyzed using the publicly available tfsearch engine. this analysis indicated the presence of consensus dna-binding sites in the exon  <dig> region for several transcription factors . proteins of the gata family have been detected in eosinophils   <cit> . additionally, gata- <dig> transactivates the eos <dig> promoter, an eosinophil-specific promoter, through a site in the 5'utr  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that proteins of the gata family bind to sites in exon  <dig>  in order to address the binding of gata proteins to ccr <dig> exon  <dig>  we prepared oligonucleotides corresponding to probe e1-b and -c with the gata site mutated. as demonstrated in figure 3a, when used as cold competitor, the gata mutant oligonucleotide was not capable of interfering with the binding of nuclear factors to either ccr <dig> exon  <dig> probe e1-b or probe e1-c. additionally, we used a gata consensus oligonucleotide with binding sites for gata proteins. this oligonucleotide completely abolished binding of nuclear factors to both ccr <dig> exon  <dig> probes e1-b and e1-c . together, these data indicate that gata proteins, present in nuclear extracts of aml <dig> d <dig> cells, are capable of binding to ccr <dig> exon  <dig> sequence.

in order to delineate which gata factors are binding to exon  <dig>  nuclear extracts from aml <dig> d <dig> cells were incubated with the radiolabelled full-length ccr <dig> exon  <dig> probe in the presence or absence of anti-gata- <dig> antibody. as seen in figure 3b, the gata- <dig> antibody was able to interfere with the binding of the protein factor from the nuclear extracts to the radiolabelled probe. in order to more precisely localize to which part of exon  <dig> gata- <dig> is capable of binding, overlapping oligonucleotide probes were radiolabelled and incubated with nuclear extracts from aml <dig> d <dig> cells in the presence and absence of the gata- <dig> antibody. this treatment efficiently inhibited the binding of probes e1-b and -c to the nuclear factor . these data indicate that gata- <dig>  present in nuclear extracts of aml <dig> d <dig> cells, is at least one of the factors capable of binding the ccr <dig> exon  <dig> between bp  <dig> and  <dig> 

characterization of the ccr <dig> promoter in vivo
we have previously characterized the human ccr <dig> promoter in vitro  <cit> . in order to determine if this region had promoter activity in vivo and to assess cell-specificity, we generated transgenic mice expressing the reporter gene egfp under the control of the ccr <dig> promoter .  <dig>  kb of the promoter and  <dig> base pairs of exon  <dig> were cloned upstream of the egfp gene. seven transgenic founder lines were identified. two of the founder lines did not transmit the transgene to their offspring and one line did not show transgene expression as determined by northern blotting and rt-pcr . in four of the lines the level and pattern of transgene expression varied suggesting integration site effects. two of the lines  displayed minimal mrna expression and were not further analyzed. in contrast, the other two lines  showed high expression of the transgene in multiple tissues. line  <dig>  displayed varying levels of mrna expression in all organs tested: lungs, kidneys, jejunum, thymus, bone marrow, and spleen, with highest expression in the thymus . while we expected the transcript to be about  <dig> kb in size , two bands ~ <dig> and  <dig> kb were apparent. since this was not the case with other lines, we suspect it is integration-site specific and another gene may have been transcribed together with gfp. however, the size of the rt-pcr amplified fragment was of the expected size and the protein was detectable by immunohistochemistry  thus implying that this did not affect the translation of the protein and integrity of the epitope for the antibody. expression in the lungs, jejunum, thymus and kidney was confirmed by anti-gfp immunohistochemistry . in the jejunum, staining was present predominantly in stromal cells . of note, eosinophils normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract and are located in the stroma of the jejunum. however, in the lungs, which are normally devoid of eosinophils at baseline, there was gfp expression that was confined to the alveolar lining consistent with predominant expression in type i pneumocytes . in the thymus, compared to staining without primary antibody , all thymocytes stained positive for gfp. additionally, in the kidney all cells were positive, both in the medulla and cortex . line  <dig>  displayed a different pattern of transgene expression. northern blot analysis revealed expression in multiple organs with the lungs and kidneys expressing the highest levels . consistent with this, protein was detected by immunohistochemistry at high levels in lungs and kidneys and only marginally in the jejunum . while staining in the lungs was comparable to line  <dig> , only a minority of stromal cells and no epithelial cells were stained in the jejunum. in the kidney, almost all cells expressed the transgene in the medulla, while in the cortex staining was prominent in the glomeruli. there was no anti-gfp staining observed in wild type mice . no changes in expression were found when the transgene was crossed with cd <dig> il- <dig> transgenic mice . in summary, the  <dig>  kb of the 5' flanking region of the ccr <dig> gene has strong promoter activity in vivo. however, both the level and pattern of expression vary between founder lines and lack cell specificity. thus, the identified region of the ccr <dig> promoter contains a broadly active promoter with hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic activity.

discussion
in this report, dnase i hypersensitivity implicated untranslated exon  <dig> in regulating ccr <dig> transcription. furthermore, nuclear proteins derived from eosinophilic cells were shown to bind ccr <dig> exon between nucleotides + <dig> to + <dig>  using unlabelled competitors and antibodies, proteins of the gata family, specifically gata- <dig>  were shown to bind to this region. taken together, these data suggest that untranslated exon  <dig>  via gata- <dig>  has a regulatory role in ccr <dig> transcription. finally, we demonstrate that the  <dig> -kb ccr <dig> promoter element, that includes exon  <dig>  is broadly active in vivo.

the hs <dig> site was located in the vicinity of exon  <dig>  combined with our previous results demonstrating diminished promoter activity when exon  <dig> is deleted from the promoter construct, these data suggested that 5' untranslated exon  <dig> may have a regulatory function. it has been reported that the 5' untranslated exons may contain sequences that facilitate transcription of the gene. examples include a gata- <dig> site in the 5'-utr of the γ-globin gene, an hnf- <dig> site in the plasminogen gene, a pu. <dig> site in the pu. <dig> gene and a c/ebp site in the ccr <dig> gene  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that nuclear proteins bind to exon  <dig>  our emsa analysis, coupled with cold competitors and specific antibodies, indicates that proteins of the gata family, specifically gata- <dig> bind to the ccr <dig> exon  <dig>  thus, gata- <dig> binding to exon  <dig> may regulate ccr <dig> transcription. alternatively, gata- <dig> binding to exon  <dig> may affect transcription start site function, rna stability or translation. these possibilities will be addressed in future studies.

it is important that this data be viewed with what is known about other myeloid-specific promoters, that have often proven to be difficult to function independently in vivo. for example, constructs using the 5' flanking region of myeloid-specific genes have not been useful for transgenic work . better success was obtained when the entire gene, including the open reading frame, was used . these constructs were at least  <dig> kb in size and contained all exons and introns and several kb of 5' and 3' flanking sequence. presumably, these larger constructs contained the locus control region - sequences that have the ability to dominantly control gene expression in any chromosomal region. this in turn allows for a high degree of consistency among independent mouse lines with regard to cell specificity, level of expression and proportionality to gene copy number. these regions may be located at several different sites in the gene, including introns and coding exons; thus, screening with dnase i hypersensitivity is usually the first method employed to identify these regions. transgenic mice expressing the egfp reporter gene under the control of the ccr <dig> promoter demonstrate that the  <dig>  kb promoter and  <dig> bp of exon  <dig> of the ccr <dig> gene confer strong promoter activity in vivo. however, these sequences do not contain the entire lcr, since expression of the reporter gene was variable among multiple founder lines. dnase i hypersensitivity studies discovered one hypersensitive site in the ccr <dig> locus. the hs <dig> site was apparently not sufficient for integration-site independent effects, since it is contained in the promoter construct used. thus, future studies will need to broaden the search for the ccr <dig> lcr. it is important to note that the true cellular specificity of ccr <dig> has not been established. while this gene product is often considered to be specific for inflammatory cells involved in allergic inflammation , several reports have documented expression by other cell types including additional leukocytes , as well as tissue cells   <cit> . thus, it remains to be determined if our observation that the ccr <dig> promoter has broad activity in vivo represents the true endogenous activity.

since ccr <dig> is expressed strongly on eosinophils, analysis of the signals that induce its expression may give insight into the molecular mechanisms for the commitment of myeloid progenitors to the eosinophil lineage. it is generally believed that transcription factors are the final common pathway driving differentiation and that hematopoietic commitment to different lineages is driven by alternative expression of specific combinations of transcription factors  <cit> . although no eosinophil-specific transcription factors have been reported, eosinophil commitment appears to be regulated by gata- <dig>  pu- <dig> and c/ebp proteins  <cit> . consistent with this, dna binding sites for these transcription factors are found in several eosinophil-selective promoters, such as the promoter for major basic protein , il- <dig> receptor alpha  chain and charcot-leyden crystal  protein. specifically, ectopic overexpression of gata- <dig> in chicken myeloblasts leads to transdifferentiation into eosinophils or thromboblasts depending on the dose used  <cit> . gata- <dig> transactivates several eosinophil-selective promoters  <cit>  including the avian eos <dig> promoter in which the gata- <dig> site is located downstream of the transcription start site  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in this report we have demonstrated that: 1) dnase i hypersensitivity studies implicate untranslated exon  <dig> in ccr <dig> transcription; 2) proteins of the gata family, specifically gata- <dig>  bind to untranslated exon  <dig> in the ccr <dig> gene; and 3) the  <dig>  kb 5' flanking region of the ccr <dig> gene is broadly active as a promoter in vivo.
