BACKGROUND
spider silks are ideal for studying the molecular evolutionary processes that create and maintain adaptive characteristics. an individual spider can produce and use different silk types singly or in combination for specific tasks, with each silk type having mechanical properties well-suited to its function. for example, aciniform silk is used in prey immobilization and egg sac construction  <cit> . the mechanical properties of aciniform silk include impressive extensibility and toughness  <cit> , making it excellent for swathing struggling prey because it is easy to stretch but difficult to break. orb-weaving garden spiders from the genus argiope are renowned for their use of aciniform silk. argiope employ many layers of aciniform silk to completely immobilize and envelop their prey , and argiope are also a model system for studying the purpose of aciniform-silk web decorations, known as stabilimenta, that have been implicated in predator avoidance, prey attraction, and web stability .

of the five fibrous silks spun by the silver garden orb-weaver argiope argentata, aciniform silk is the toughest and one of the most extensible  <cit> . however, little is known about the evolution of aciniform silk’s physical attributes. spider silk mechanical properties are related to the suite of proteins that compose each silk type. the majority of spider silk proteins, or spidroins , are encoded by members of a single gene family. spidroins are typically very large , and are dominated by a series of iterated repeats flanked by short amino - and carboxy -terminal regions  <cit> . the length, number, and amino acid  composition of the iterated repeats are silk-type specific, whereas phylogenetic analyses have shown that aa residues in the n- and c-terminal regions are more conserved across spidroins  <cit> . repeat aa sequence corresponds to secondary structures that are partly responsible for silk mechanical properties , and conservation of the n- and c-terminal regions  <cit>  and their presence in spun silk fibers suggests an important role in spider silk biology  <cit> .

the evolutionary maintenance of spidroin repeat sequences within a silk type and the divergence of those repeat sequences between silk types is central to spider silk function and diversity. within a particular spidroin, repeat units tend to be highly similar, or homogeneous, in amino acid and nucleotide sequence. the gene encoding aciniform spidroin  has repeats that are relatively complex among spidroin family members, however, despite this complexity, acsp <dig> repeats are also spectacularly homogenized  <cit> . a recent analysis of a complete acsp <dig> from the western black widow latrodectus hesperus showed that its repetitive region, like those of other spidroins, is dominated by the amino acids glycine , alanine , and serine   <cit> . however, l. hesperus acsp <dig> repeats have few or none of the short glycine and alanine-rich subunits, such as ggx, poly-ga, and poly-a, that can be the bulk of other spidroin repeats  <cit> . nevertheless, l. hesperus acsp <dig> repeats are remarkably homogenized . this is consistent with results from a partial length acsp <dig> cdna from the banded garden orb-weaver argiope trifasciata, which has  <dig> repeats that are each 600 bp and share  <dig> % identity at the nucleotide level  <cit> .

the high level of acsp <dig> repeat homogeneity is frequently attributed to gene conversion or unequal crossing over resulting in intragenic concerted evolution . concerted evolution usually refers to homogenization among gene family members, such as rdna gene copies  <cit> , but it can also occur within a gene  <cit> . stabilizing selection alone would maintain protein sequence, resulting in a high level of repeat identity at the aa level. however, the extreme level of homogenization reported for acsp <dig> repeats provides evidence for concerted evolution because it exists at both the protein and nucleotide levels  <cit> .

in addition to concerted evolution, repeat homogeneity in acsp <dig> may be maintained by functional constraints. recent nuclear magnetic resonance  studies of acsp <dig> repeats from both nephila antipodiana and a. trifasciata delineate different domains in each repeat unit, one domain that is rich in alpha helices and one that is not  <cit> . xu et al.  <cit>  used nmr and dihedral angles from global likelihood estimate  analyses to predict the chemical shift indices of a  <dig> aa recombinant a. trifasciata acsp <dig> repeat. the consensus secondary structure assignments specified that the last quarter of the protein was unstructured, but that the first three-quarters of the repeat contained six major helical regions. protein structures such as these six alpha helices are considered the foundation for silk mechanical properties .

assessing the extent to which a spidroin is homogenized within a single gene or among individuals is difficult because the repetitive region makes it exceptionally challenging to sequence complete spidroin genes. indeed, partial length sequences that are biased toward the c-terminus greatly dominate the number of published spidroins  <cit> . additionally, the evolutionary processes leading to spidroin divergence between species and silk types are often unclear due to a lack of knowledge about spidroin genetic variation among individuals.

here, we address these issues by presenting a complete spidroin gene from an argiope spider, the acsp <dig> sequence of a. argentata , and by screening for acsp <dig> variation among individual a. argentata, a. trifasciata, and a. aurantia spider genomes. sequencing the full array of aar_acsp <dig> repeats enabled us to test hypotheses of concerted evolution and functional constraints. based on previous spidroin research, aar_acsp <dig> repeats should be extremely homogenous at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. in addition, amino acid sequences that are predicted to correspond to the structural motifs that contribute to the toughness and extensibility of aciniform silk should be more conserved between argiope species relative to surrounding regions. among the surveyed a. argentata individuals, we expected aar_acsp <dig> to be a single-copy gene, similar to l. hesperus acsp <dig> <cit> . between species, previous research suggests that the spidroin repeats within each silk type are highly conserved, but that the terminal regions show more variation  <cit> , and we hypothesized that aar_acsp <dig> would also follow this pattern.

RESULTS
argiope argentata acsp <dig> complete sequence and phylogenetic placement
despite obtaining  <dig> acsp <dig> cdna clones, including one that was >8 kb  <cit> , a complete argiope acsp <dig> remained elusive until the present study. by screening a large-insert genomic dna library, we sequenced and assembled  <dig>  bp of a. argentata dna including a complete open reading frame that is  <dig>  bp long and predicted to encode a  <dig>  aa a. argentata acsp <dig> . no introns were detected. the putative protein has a predicted size of ~430 kda, and the most abundant amino acids are serine , alanine  and glycine . aar_acsp <dig> has three regions, a central repetitive region that is flanked by conserved n- and c-terminal regions. the repetitive region dominates ~90% of the protein and is composed of  <dig> iterated repeats . the first  <dig> repeats are each  <dig> aa, and the last repeat is  <dig> aa due to truncation at the end . the length, amino acid composition, and organization of acsp <dig> are all consistent with other spidroin family members  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of aar_acsp <dig> n- and c-terminal coding regions with those from other spidroins grouped aar_acsp <dig> with the latrodectus  acsp <dig> sequences in a well-supported clade . latrodectus and argiope are estimated to have diverged from each other ~ <dig> million years ago   <cit> . despite this lengthy time period, the recovery of an acsp <dig> clade was consistent with prior studies in which spidroin sequences nearly always grouped based on silk type . the sister group to the acsp <dig> clade was tusp <dig>  tubuliform  spidroin, suggesting that these paralogs have a relatively recent common ancestor  <cit> . further potential evidence of their shared ancestry is that both of these silk types are used in egg-case construction and both have repeats that are relatively complex compared to other spidroins  <cit> . in our phylogenetic analysis, a large, weakly supported assemblage of spidroins is sister to the combined acsp <dig> and tusp <dig> clade. given the low support, it is unclear which spidroins are most closely related to acsp <dig> and tusp <dig> 

argiope argentata acsp <dig> repeat homogeneity
as expected, aar_acsp <dig> repeats are complex and spectacularly homogenized. although glycine, alanine, and serine account for ~50% of its repetitive region composition, aar_acsp <dig> has few of the glycine/alanine-rich motifs such as ggx, gpg, poly-ga, and poly-a that are dominant in the dragline major ampullate spidroins  from argiope and other taxa  <cit> . at the nucleotide level, the average pairwise percent identity between aar_acsp <dig> repeats is an astonishing  <dig> %. complexity and extreme homogenization are also features of previously described acsp <dig> sequences  <cit> .

the extreme nucleotide identity of aar_acsp <dig> is consistent with concerted evolution, and cannot be easily explained by codon usage bias. for example, aar_acsp <dig> codon use is strongly influenced by amino acid position within a repeat. in our repeat alignment , the neighboring alanine codons at nucleotide positions 103– <dig> and 106– <dig> are gcc and gct, respectively. gccgct is present in the same relative location in all twenty repeats. similarly, the glycine codons that appear at nucleotide positions 64– <dig> and 130– <dig> also consistently use different codons . the same alternative codons are used at the same exact positions throughout most, if not all, the repeats. despite a slight skew toward alanine codons that end in adenine  or thymine  , it is difficult to postulate that selective forces acting at the level of codon usage are responsible for the extensive homogeneity of codon positions found throughout the 612 bp aar_acsp <dig> repeat. concerted evolution that fixes particular codons at particular locations across repeats provides a clearer explanation.

analyses of the full array of aar_acsp <dig> iterated repeats were also consistent with two concerted evolution predictions. first, ml analysis grouped araneid acsp <dig> repeats into well-supported, species-specific clades rather than grouping the repeats across species . furthermore, nucleotide pairwise identity within each species averaged 98%, but pairwise identity between aar_acsp <dig> repeats and repeats from other species averaged only  <dig> % . that repeats are more similar within species than between species regardless of intragenic repeat position can be explained by rapid intra-specific spread of genetic variation via unequal crossing over during recombination  <cit> .

second, the average nucleotide pairwise identity of the first and last aar_acsp <dig> repeats to the rest of the array is slightly lower at 96% and 93%, respectively. less similar first and last repeats are consistent with some models of concerted evolution  <cit> . however, araneid acsp <dig> first and last repeats still grouped within species-specific clades , suggesting that these repeat sequences are more homogeneous within a gene than those of previously analyzed spidroins. for example, in an analysis of repetitive units from the flagelliform spidroin  of the golden orb-weaver nephila clavipes and the congeneric nephila inaurata madagascariensis, the first repeats grouped together across species, and the last repeats also formed their own clade. by contrast, the central  repeats formed species-specific clades because each repetitive unit was nearly identical within each species yet divergent across species  <cit> . longer estimated divergence times between the species in our present study may explain the more thorough homogenization of araneid acsp <dig> sequences compared to that of the previously studied nephila flag sequences. the estimated divergence time between the nephila species is ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> , whereas araneus and argiope are thought to have diverged ~ <dig> mya and within argiope, ~ <dig> mya between a. argentata and a. trifasciata <cit> .

functional constraints on acsp <dig> repeats
we predicted that functional constraints would result in greater aa sequence conservation in the portion of each repeat proposed by xu et al. to contain six alpha helices  <cit> . to test this, we first compared known araneidae repetitive regions. we aligned consensus acsp <dig> repeat sequences from three argiope species  and araneus ventricosus. we then graphed pairwise identities for each aligned position between the a. trifasciata repeat sequence and the other species, and plotted it against the predicted a. trifasciata domains from xu et al.  <cit>  . using amino acid positions from xu et al.  <cit> , the average percent pairwise identity over the  <dig> aa helix-rich domain was  <dig> %, but only  <dig> % over the remaining  <dig> aa. xu et al.  <cit>  also noted a major alpha-helical domain from 102– <dig> aa, encompassing the region denoted as helix  <dig> and  <dig> in figure 3b. consistent with being structurally important, the average percent identity in this domain was  <dig> %. moreover, our alignment was slightly longer  than the a. trifasciata recombinant repeat length  due to indels that only appeared in the unstructured region. notably, in the region from 200– <dig> aa , the a. trifasciata repeat has a deletion . these indels further indicate that the final quarter of acsp <dig> repeats is less conserved than the first three-quarters.

to investigate amino acid conservation in the predicted acsp <dig> helical regions across greater evolutionary time, we also aligned consensus amino acid acsp <dig> repeat sequences from l. hesperus and uloborus diversus to the a. trifasciata repeat from xu et al.  <cit> . araneidae, represented here by argiope and araneus, and theridiidae, represented by l. hesperus, are members of the superfamily araneoidea, with araneids and theridiids estimated to have last shared a common ancestor ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . u. diversus is within the deinopoidea, the sister-group to the araneoidea. araneoids and deinopoids diverged from each other ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . together, araneoidea and deinopoidea compose the orbiculariae .

the acsp <dig> repeat units from l. hesperus and u. diversus are almost twice as long as the araneid acsp <dig> repeat units. the l. hesperus and u. diversus repeat units can be further subdivided into two parts that align with each other  <cit> . we aligned each part from each species  to the a. trifasciata repeat separately. we then calculated the average pairwise percent identity for each comparison and for each of the six putative alpha-helical regions predicted by xu et al. . the overall pairwise identities between l. hesperus repeat part  <dig> and u. diversus repeat part  <dig> with the a. trifasciata repeat was 30% and 29%, respectively. of note, the percent pairwise identity between l. hesperus repeat part  <dig> and the a. trifasciata repeat was 47% in the a. trifasciata region associated with helix  <dig>  and it was 41% against u. diversus repeat part  <dig> in the region associated with helix  <dig>  47% and 41% were the highest pairwise identity percentages.

our results strongly support the hypothesis that functional constraints are acting to conserve protein sequence in the repetitive region of acsp <dig>  our comparison of a. trifasciata acsp <dig> repeat sequence with that of other araneid species indicates that a specific amino acid sequence is maintained in the predicted helix-rich domain of acsp <dig> repeats across araneidae. in contrast, comparison between the a.trifasciata repeat with part  <dig> of repeats from l. hesperus and u. diversus indicates that amino acid sequence in the regions associated with alpha-helices  <dig> and  <dig> are the most highly conserved across orbiculariae. the higher level of conservation in the amino acid sequences corresponding to helices  <dig> and  <dig> may indicate that these regions impart the same general function across orbiculariae whereas the other predicted helical regions of a. trifasciata impart functions unique to araneidae. sequencing acsp <dig> from other genera of araneidae and other families of orbiculariae will enable further elucidation of these hypotheses.

to our knowledge, there are no current predictions about the secondary structures of l. hesperus or u. diversus acsp <dig> repeats. it is feasible that, like the acsp <dig> domains of n. antipodiana and a. trifasciata, l. hesperus and u. diversus acsp <dig> repeats also feature distinct structural regions. finally, our analysis may be an underestimation of sequence conservation because it does not include amino acid replacements that are functionally equivalent. however, predicting functional protein similarity is difficult given the extensive physicochemical changes that spider silk undergoes as it is processed from a liquid into dry silk .

delineation of acsp <dig> variants in individual argiope spiders
spidroin sequence variation between individual spiders is an important source of genetic variation for the evolution of different silk types within and between species. to investigate genetic variation in acsp <dig> between individuals of a. argentata and the congeneric a. trifasciata and a. aurantia, we first designed pcr primers targeting the repetitive region of aar_acsp <dig>  amplification of genomic dna across species and individuals resulted in acsp <dig> repeat sequences that did not show intraspecific variation but had significant inter-specific variation . intraspecific homogenization of the repeats could be explained by biased pcr amplification of a single repeat type in the repetitive region, however, our results are consistent with the high degree of repeat sequence conservation in acsp <dig> sequences from araneids  and l. hesperus <cit> .

next, we designed pcr primers targeting n- and c-terminal coding regions of aar_acsp <dig>  we then amplified the same individual genomic dnas that were surveyed for the repetitive region . unlike the repetitive region pcr, direct sequencing of terminal region pcr products resulted in extensive numbers of multiple peaks and in some cases, poor sequencing reads due to length differences. thus, all terminal region pcr products were cloned, a total of  <dig> amplicons were sequenced, and acsp <dig> variants were diagnosed. each variant was supported by at least two amplicons with sequences that had greater than 95% identical bases . unlike the repetitive region sequences, which showed no intra-specific or allelic variation, all terminal region amplifications were heterogeneous.

the number of variants characterized was surprising because all of the individual spiders surveyed were found to have more than two terminal region variants, indicating that these argiope species must have multiple acsp <dig> encoding loci. argiope spiders are not known to be polyploid, thus multiple gene copies per genome is the only explanation for more than two n- or c- terminal region variants in a single individual. for example, we found seven c-terminal variants in one a. argentata, suggesting at least four acsp <dig> gene copies . each a. trifasciata individual possessed a minimum of seven n- or c-terminal variants, again indicating at least four gene copies . likewise, an a. aurantia individual possessed six n-terminal variants but only two c-terminal variants . the smaller number of c-terminal variants could be explained by lack of variation in the c-terminal region or by incomplete sampling of variants by pcr survey.

ml analysis of sequences from the pcr survey shows that the branch lengths in the repetitive region  are shorter than the branch lengths of the terminal region trees . the majority of n- and c-terminal variants cluster into well-supported, species-specific groups, and intra-specific branch lengths are very short compared to inter-specific branch lengths . one exception is a. argentata c-terminal coding region variant v <dig>  which forms a weakly supported group with a. trifasciata and a. aurantia c-terminal coding region variants . given the weak clade support, this variant is probably an outlier that is not as homogenized as the other a. argentata variants.

the shorter branch lengths of the repetitive region variants tree compared to those of the n- and c-terminal region trees suggest that the repetitive region is the most conserved araneid acsp <dig> region . yet, comparison of the average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates  across codons implies that the n-terminal region has been subject to slightly stronger purifying selection than the repetitive and c-terminal regions . dn/ds estimations, however, assume independence of sites and thus are confounded by factors such as concerted evolution and recombination. the full-length aar_acsp <dig> and other acsp <dig> provide extensive evidence that the repetitive region units are most likely not evolving independently from each other . thus concerted evolution and purifying selection both must play a role in the near-perfect homogeneity of argiope acsp <dig> iterated repeats. recombination can also affect tests of selection  <cit> . because we could not conclusively determine the exact number of loci within an individual or assign alleles to specific loci, we were unable to ascertain recombination between loci. subsequent analyses with additional data could address the impact of recombination on dn/ds estimates.

previous work with acsp <dig> sequences did not find evidence for multiple loci  <cit> . the lack of variation among a. trifasciata acsp <dig> cdna clones  <cit>  may be due to overexpression or preferential cloning of one variant and thus its preponderance in the characterized cdnas. alternatively, consistent depletion of aciniform silk may be required to stimulate transcription of multiple acsp <dig> loci. this hypothesis is supported by a significant increase in aciniform-silk dependent web-decorating behavior in three species of argiope in response to a two-week period of aciniform silk depletion  <cit> . future work could focus on comparing the number of acsp <dig> variants expressed by spiders consistently depleted of aciniform silk versus that from spiders that are not depleted.

survey of individual l. hesperus genomes also did not find acsp <dig> variants  <cit> . however, the detection of multiple acsp <dig> loci in argiope but not latrodectus is consistent with the hypothesis that argiope spiders maintain multiple gene copies as a strategy for efficiently producing large amounts of protein. in contrast with argiope spiders, latrodectus spiders use markedly fewer strands of aciniform silk during prey capture  <cit>  and do not make stabilimenta. increased acsp <dig> copy number in argiope spiders may therefore be a strategy for increasing protein production  <cit> . because spidroins are costly, highly expressed proteins  <cit> , resource abundance in the form of prey availability may also stimulate aciniform spidroin production in argiope to prepare for resource scarcity  <cit> . precedent for this strategy exists. in the bacteria escherichia coli, multiple copies of rrna operons provide a competitive advantage by enabling increased growth rates and decreased cell division lag time in environments where resources fluctuate rapidly  <cit> .

previous research has found variants for other spidroins  <cit> , and that the dragline spidroin masp <dig> is encoded by multiple loci in several species  <cit> . unlike a. argentata acsp <dig> variants, the c-terminal coding region of l. hesperus masp <dig> is nearly identical across loci  <cit> . this difference could indicate functional constraints on the c-terminal coding region of masp <dig> that either differ from or are not acting on acsp <dig>  a comparison of structural component predictions from the amino acid sequences of terminal regions across different spidroins would greatly inform our understanding of the contribution of the terminal regions to the evolution of different spider silk types.

CONCLUSIONS
the highly similar iterated repeat array of our complete argiope argentata acsp <dig> gene combined with sequence conservation of functionally important regions of individual repeats supports a hypothesis of concerted evolution and functional constraints acting together to homogenize aar_acsp <dig> repeats. in addition, several terminal region variants per individual argiope genome indicate multiple argiope acsp <dig> loci. across acsp <dig> loci within an individual, we found homogenization of the repetitive region, but variation at the terminal coding regions. we also found evidence for stronger purifying selection in the n-terminal region versus the repetitive or c-terminal region, suggesting that the n-terminal region is the most constrained portion of the aciniform spidroin. the maintenance of multiple copies of acsp <dig> in argiope genomes underscores the importance of aciniform silk in argiope ecology and evolution. indeed, variation between individuals and multiple gene copies within individuals could provide a method for the rapid synthesis of aciniform silk in this genus, and may represent the early stages of the differentiation that led to the extraordinary sequence and functional diversity of spider silks.
