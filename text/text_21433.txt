BACKGROUND
aedes aegypti is an important vector of arbovirus pathogens  <cit> . understanding anti-viral defense mechanisms in mosquitoes will help define important features of vector competence and could lead to novel arbovirus control strategies. in contrast to what is known about mosquito responses to bacterial and fungal infections, little has been published concerning mosquito anti-viral defense . in addition, there are fundamental differences between components of the canonical anti-viral defense mechanisms in vertebrates and invertebrates. for example, orthologous genes for the anti-viral effector molecules of vertebrates, such as type i interferons, protein kinase r, and 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthase, are not present in invertebrate genomes  <cit> .

signal transduction pathways known to be involved in bacterial and fungal innate immunity can be affected during arbovirus infections in vector mosquitoes and other insects . for example, elements of the toll signal transduction pathway are enriched in ae. aegypti orally challenged with sindbis virus   <cit> . the janus-kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription  and toll signal transduction pathways also are activated in drosophila melanogaster during infection with the insect pathogens drosophila c virus  and drosophila x virus   <cit> . however, some key differences are evident between mosquitoes and the model organism d. melanogaster. for example, stat activity is suppressed in aedes cell culture during flavivirus infection   <cit> , but stimulated in drosophila during dcv infection  <cit> .

rna interference , an rna silencing mechanism, is triggered by the recognition of intracellular long double-stranded rnas  and is an important anti-viral response in invertebrates  <cit> . because such evidence is lacking in mosquitoes, we relied on rnai pathway functional information from model organisms, such as drosophila. researchers have long hypothesized that rna silencing plays a role in anti-viral defense because of the presence of dsrna structures formed by some rna viruses in host cells  <cit> . recent studies in mutant drosophila adults confirmed the identity of specific genes that recognize, recruit and destroy viral rnas  <cit> . dicer- <dig>  is essential for initiation of anti-viral defense in drosophila, as it processes long dsrnas into small interfering rnas  of about 21– <dig> bp  <cit> . dcr <dig>  with r2d <dig>  loads one unwound strand of each sirna into the multi-component rna-induced silencing complex . in the effector phase, a risc-loaded sirna strand is used as a guide for target recognition and cleavage by argonaute  <dig>   <cit> . in addition to ago <dig> and other proteins, tudor staphylococcal nuclease  is also a component of risc  <cit> . this protein has multiple functions, including transcriptional co-activation, non-specific single-stranded rna cleavage, and cleavage of hyper-edited dsrna substrates  <cit> . although it plays a clear role in rnai, a link to anti-viral defense has not yet been shown. the ae. aegypti genome has orthologs to all of these components  <cit> .

beginning in the mid-1990's, we provided evidence in both mosquito cell culture and adult mosquitoes that long dsrna triggers rna silencing, which suppresses replication of arboviruses  <cit> . more recently, we have shown that in an gambiae, ago <dig> and ago <dig> are required for defense against intrathoracically injected o'nyong-nyong virus   <cit> . in addition, in a transgenic ae. aegypti line, ago <dig> is required for rnai-mediated defense against dengue virus  infection  <cit> . arbovirus infection of vector mosquitoes is most influenced by midgut infection and escape barriers, and to a lesser extent, salivary gland infection barriers, which combine to influence the ability of a mosquito to serve as a competent vector   <cit> . a fuller understanding of the role of rnai-mediated defense is needed, especially in light of the knowledge that ae. aegypti, even with the anti-viral rnai arsenal, is often unable to clear a virus infection before the virus disseminates to the salivary glands for transmission to a new host.

to determine whether rnai components are required for ae. aegypti anti-viral defense, recombinant sindbis viruses  bearing enhanced green fluorescent protein  markers were used. sinv is not naturally transmitted by ae. aegypti, therefore, this comprised a model system with which to investigate the inherent features of anti-viral defense. dcr <dig>  ago <dig> and tsn transcripts were silenced prior to oral infection by the recombinant sinv, tr339-egfp. tr <dig>  representing a paleoarctic/ethiopian sinv genotype, when fed at high titer, initiates modest ae. aegypti midgut infections that are often cleared by  <dig> days, with consequent dissemination rates to distal tissues of about 40%  <cit> . here, we show that silencing these rnai components results in a transient increase in tr339-egfp titers and infection rates, thus supporting roles for each of these genes in anti-viral defense. importantly, we provide evidence of virus genome-derived small rnas in un-manipulated sinv-infected mosquitoes, thus confirming rnai activity.

in addition, we compared alterations in midgut rnai component transcript and protein profiles during infection with two recombinant sinv strains that exhibit marked differences in growth kinetics in the mosquito. in contrast to tr339-egfp, mre16-egfp, representing an oriental/australian sinv genotype, fed at high titer, efficiently and persistently infects ae. aegypti midguts and disseminates to other tissues in about 80% of mosquitoes  <cit> . we found that both rnai component transcript and protein levels varied in a virus-dependent manner, highlighting the need to consider various virus genotypes in understanding rnai-virus interactions.

RESULTS
rnai components in ae aegypti
ae. aegypti ago <dig>  dcr <dig>  and tsn genes were identified by homology to d. melanogaster and the an. gambiae orthologs. these genes are present as single copy 1:1: <dig> orthologous trios. ae. aegypti orthologs encode conserved protein domains that identify them as rnai components . the major catalytic enzyme, ae aegypti ago <dig>  shares  <dig> % amino acid  identity with the an. gambiae ortholog and  <dig> % identity with the d. melanogaster ortholog . similarly, ae. aegypti dcr <dig> shares  <dig> % a.a. identity with an. gambiae dcr <dig> and  <dig> % with d. melanogaster .ae aegypti tsn shows more conservation across species, with  <dig> % and 63% a.a. identity, respectively . these levels of similarity are common among proteins of these species  <cit> .

effects of ago <dig>  dcr <dig>  or tsn dsrna injection on tr339-egfp infection
to determine whether ae. aegypti rnai components are required for defense against sinv tr339-egfp, dcr <dig>  ago <dig>  and tsn were silenced by injection of dsrna  <dig> days prior to an infectious bloodmeal. we predicted that dsrna injection would transiently silence expression of these genes, because pre-existing risc proteins should be available to initiate the silencing process. although both tsn and dcr <dig> transcripts showed evidence of transient silencing in midguts following dsrna injection, there was no detectable reduction in ago <dig> mrna levels by qrt-pcr . however, there was a reduction in ago <dig>  <dig> kda protein levels, compared to non-specific dsrna-injected controls, in unfed midguts just prior to an infectious bloodmeal and at  <dig> dpi . the silencing was no longer evident by  <dig> dpi. on average, ago <dig> protein levels were reduced to 49% of controls  immediately prior to the virus meal and 22% of controls  at  <dig> dpi. previous reports showed that dsrna effectively silences most targeted genes in the midgut of several different mosquito species for > <dig> days post-injection  <cit> . in the current study, silencing of rnai components is more transient.

to determine if ago <dig> dsrna-injections altered virus replication, viral  and  rna strands were detected by two-step qrt-pcr of tr339-egfp-infected mosquito midgut pools. tr339-egfp  strand rnas showed a transient increase over beta-galactosidase -injected controls at  <dig> dpi . the transient increase showed a high variance, probably due to variability in the absolute number of ingested viral particles per mosquito. importantly, although viral copy number varied from experiment to experiment, in each replicate, ago <dig> dsrna-treated mosquito midguts showed higher viral copy number than bgal-treated. in contrast, no changes were observed in the copy number of tr339-egfp  strand rna .

with the knowledge that rnai component silencing requires a functional risc, we predicted that enhancement of viral titers would be transient. indeed, ago <dig> silencing resulted in transient increases in tr339-egfp infection rates in whole mosquitoes  and increased median viral titers  . viral egfp fluorescence in midguts of ago <dig> -silenced mosquitoes was higher than controls at  <dig> dpi ; however, enhanced viral infection and replication were no longer evident by  <dig> dpi . together, these results indicate the requirement for ago <dig> in anti-viral defense during tr339-egfp infection.

light: 1–33% of the midgut infected; moderate: 34–66%; heavy: 67–100%; illustrations of infection patterns have been previously reported  <cit> .

a similar pattern of enhanced viral infection was observed following dcr <dig> dsrna treatment. transient dcr <dig> silencing resulted in temporary increases in tr339-egfp infection rates compared to controls  , however increases in egfp fluorescence were not significant . at  <dig> dpi, the dcr <dig> dsrna-injected group also had significantly higher median titers than βgal controls  , and, by  <dig> dpi, the effect was abrogated . as was seen with ago <dig>  there is a clear requirement for dcr <dig> during anti-viral defense.

tsn silencing showed less striking enhancement of viral infection than either ago <dig> or dcr <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, median viral titers of tsn-silenced mosquitoes were not significantly different from controls ; however infection rates were slightly higher . by  <dig> dpi, the infection pattern, detected by egfp fluorescence showed significantly higher dissemination , even though clearing of midgut infection was evident . this fluorescence was primarily present in hemolymph with very little in peripheral tissues. concurrently, viral titers were reduced to levels below those of controls . importantly, detection of egfp in this system is indicative of viral protein production. therefore, the egfp fluorescence in hemocytes coupled with reduced viral titers indicates that only a small amount of live virus escaped the midgut. alternatively, hemocytes became infected in the midgut and then migrated to other tissues. nevertheless, the virus was limited in its ability to replicate further. all of the results suggest that the effects of silencing wane by  <dig> dpi. this could be due to the decay of exogenously-administered dsrna, or transient stimulation of infection rates at  <dig> dpi might be overcome by a stimulated anti-viral defense pathway by  <dig> dpi.

sinv non-structural protein  <dig>  participates in replication complex formation  <cit> . injection of dsrna derived from tr <dig> nsp <dig> showed that this treatment nearly ablated viral replication in  <dig> of  <dig> mosquitoes at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi . midgut egfp fluorescence was significantly reduced in nsp3-targeted mosquitoes  . this evidence demonstrates the ability of virus rna-derived dsrna to trigger anti-viral rnai in ae aegypti.

transient ago <dig>  dcr <dig> or tsn silencing does not increase mortality during tr339-egfp infection
mutation of genes encoding rnai pathway components in d. melanogaster resulted in increased mortality of flies infected with invertebrate viral pathogens  <cit> . in addition, there is evidence that some arboviruses cause pathology in infected mosquito tissues  <cit> . to determine whether rnai components prevent mortality during sinv infection, we examined survival curves of tr339-egfp infected ae. aegypti injected with ago <dig>  dcr <dig> or tsn dsrna. results indicated that mortality was not increased over βgal dsrna-injected controls . the transient effects of the dsrna injection or the weak replication of tr339-egfp may have been factors in the lack of mortality. therefore, the mortality study was repeated with dcr <dig> silenced mosquitoes infected with mre16-egfp. again, there was no significant enhancement of mosquito mortality . nevertheless, to confirm these preliminary findings, a gene knock-out system for mosquitoes would be required.

evidence of rnai pathway activity
the production of sequence-specific small rnas is a hallmark of rnai defense. rnai activity was confirmed during natural tr339-egfp and mre16-egfp infections by identifying viral small rnas in adult female mosquitoes . we used mre16-egfp whole genome capture probes, as these two viruses share about 75% nucleotide identity  <cit> . tr339-egfp infected mosquitoes accumulated far more small viral rnas between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi than mre16-egfp infected mosquitoes. small viral rnas from mre16-egfp were barely detectable only at  <dig> dpi. these data are interesting in light of the differences in replication kinetics of these two viruses . they could indicate a correlation between replication efficiency in the mosquito and susceptibility to the anti-viral rnai defense, or they could point to a viral suppressor of rnai in the mre16-egfp virus  <cit> . it is also apparent that tr339-egfp-derived  sense small rnas are more abundant than  sense small rna in mosquito tissues. this suggests that the  virus strand is targeted by rnai more efficiently than the  virus strand or that diced  sense viral rna is preferentially stabilized in the risc and used as the guide strand. it could also suggest that the primary viral dsrna trigger is  sense viral rna secondary structure, rather than  and  dsrna of the replicative intermediate.

mosquito and viral transcript analysis
the mosquito midgut is the initial site of arbovirus replication and thus is suspected to be the first site of anti-viral defense. blood-feeding alone results in reduced midgut dcr <dig> mrna levels at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-feeding  . although fluctuations were also observed in ago <dig>  dcr <dig> and tsn mrna levels at other timepoints, they were not significantly different from controls.

tr339-egfp and mre16-egfp replicate and amplify in the midgut for  <dig> to  <dig> days prior to escape to other tissues  <cit> . mosquitoes were orally infected with either mre16-egfp or tr339-egfp, and rnai component midgut transcript levels were determined relative to un-infected blood-fed controls . the mosquito's overall transcript pattern differed for each virus strain. during mre16-egfp infection, tsn transcript levels, but not ago <dig> or dcr <dig>  were significantly enriched over controls at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi , and highly variable at  <dig> dpi. in contrast, during tr339-egfp infection, tsn transcript levels were not significantly enriched until  <dig> dpi, when a 5-fold enrichment was followed by a sharp decrease at  <dig> dpi .

enhancement of ae. aegypti tsn transcripts was previously reported in microarray analyses of sinv mre <dig> infection  <cit> . the tsn transcript enrichment in ae. aegypti during sinv infection contrasts with reports of tsn depletion in drosophila during dcv infection  <cit> . dcv has a single-stranded positive sense rna genome, as does sinv. however, dcv, a picorna-like virus, is an insect-specific pathogen whereas sinv is an arbovirus, and by definition, infects both mosquitoes and vertebrates and establishes persistent, non-lethal infections in the insect vector.

detection of  strand rna served as evidence of viral replication in the samples used for rnai component transcript analysis. interestingly, viral replication markedly differed between the two sinv strains. mre16-egfp  rna levels increased over the  <dig> day period, from an average of  <dig> copies per nanogram  midgut rna at  <dig> dpi to  <dig> copies at  <dig> dpi . in contrast, tr339-egfp  rna was undetectable in  <dig> of  <dig> experimental replicates at  <dig> dpi and increased to an average high of  <dig> copies at  <dig> dpi. over the remainder of the  <dig> day time course,  strand rna levels remained low . the steady increase in  strand sinv rna in mosquitoes over the  <dig> day period differs from that observed in vertebrate cell culture. in vertebrate cells,  strand rna synthesis ceases about  <dig> hr post-infection, due to the cleavage of nsp1- <dig> products shifting replication towards  strand synthesis  <cit> . the continued increase in  strand rna in midguts in contrast to that of vertebrate cell culture is probably due to the progressive cell-to-cell spread of virus through the tissue, whereas, in vitro cell culture infection is initiated by bathing all cells in virus.

importantly, despite clear differences in mre16-egfp and tr339-egfp growth characteristics, no statistically significant changes from controls were seen for ago <dig> or dcr <dig> mrnas during sinv infection . further, enrichment of tsn transcripts occurred at different times following infection for each virus strain. transcript enrichment occurred early during mre16-egfp infection concomitant with viral replication, whereas, tsn enrichment in tr339-egfp infected midguts was delayed, possibly because viral replication remained at low levels. these results suggest that tsn may act as a sensor for the rnai pathway.

ago <dig> protein profiles
the lack of statistically significant increases in ago <dig> transcript levels during sinv infection led us to ask whether protein levels fluctuated. figure  <dig> shows ago <dig> protein profiles in mre16-egfp and tr339-egfp infected midguts compared to unfed and un-infected blood-fed controls. bloodfeeding alone reduces ago <dig> protein levels compared to midguts from unfed mosquitoes, and these proteins re-accumulated over a time period concomitant with the expected time course of bloodmeal digestion, vitellogenesis, and a return to the unfed state.

virus infection influenced ago <dig> protein patterns in the midgut. depletion of ago <dig> protein occurred during either tr339-egfp or mre16-egfp infection at  <dig> dpi; thereafter, ago <dig> protein levels varied in a virus-dependent manner, and were distinct from the profile seen in un-infected controls. in mre16-egfp-infected midguts, ago <dig> protein remained depleted at  <dig> dpi and increased over un-infected controls at  <dig> dpi. this enrichment corresponds to the concurrent, though statistically insignificant, increase in ago <dig> transcripts . in contrast, during tr339-egfp infection, ago <dig> protein levels were enriched and evident as multiple bands at  <dig> dpi, were roughly equivalent to bloodfed controls at  <dig> dpi, and reduced again at  <dig> dpi. by  <dig> dpi, protein profiles for all virus-infected midguts were similar to those of bloodfed controls . when comparing natural fluctuations of ago <dig> protein levels in figure  <dig> with those from dsrna-injected mosquitoes in figure  <dig>  it is apparent that injection of non-specific dsrna results in depletion of ago <dig> levels.

summary
in summary, the low level of tr339-egfp replication in midguts, coupled with a lack of ago <dig> protein depletion and the detection of small viral rnas, indicates that anti-viral rnai defense is active during infection with this virus. the low steady state levels of  strand rna detected by qrt-pcr do not reveal fluctuations that could occur due to rna replication or degradation. therefore, further analysis is required to determine whether these low levels are due to inefficient replication or an active rnai response. a much different pattern was observed during mre16-egfp infection. mre16-egfp replicates to significantly higher copy number than tr339-egfp while somehow preventing the accumulation of small viral rnas indicative of effective rnai defense. the specifics of this evasion or suppression mechanism are not understood and warrant further study. importantly, these results underscore the different effects that can occur with different arboviruses and indicate that specific effects on the rnai pathway need to be characterized separately for each virus system.

CONCLUSIONS
the dissimilar growth kinetics of the two recombinant sinv strains might be due to differences in ability to evade rnai defense. the parallel detection of virus replication, viral small rnas, and rnai component transcripts and proteins indicates that anti-viral defense occurs early in infection. these data support the hypothesis that rnai anti-viral defense occurs in ae. aegypti against sinv infection. the reduction of ago <dig> protein levels soon after non-infectious blood or sinv/blood meals suggests that expression of new defense proteins may be a rate-limiting step in anti-viral defense. variations in ago <dig>  dcr <dig>  and tsn transcripts and protein levels, as well as variation in accumulation of viral small rnas from infected mosquitoes, suggests that anti-viral defense activity differs in a virus-dependent manner, potentially because some viruses have the ability to avoid or suppress the rnai response. our data also suggest that regulation of the rnai pathway in mosquitoes, as well as rnai pathway/arbovirus interactions, differ from those in non-vector insects infected with pathogenic viruses. the first evidence for this is that tsn, a transcriptional co-activator, transcripts are enriched during arbovirus infection, whereas, in drosophila, this does not occur  <cit> . moreover, mosquitoes with transiently silenced rnai components, harbouring higher sinv titers, did not exhibit increased mortality as compared to controls, unlike drosophila infected with pathogenic insect viruses.

future directions
the differential effects of mre16-egfp and tr339-egfp on rnai pathway activity indicate a need to investigate the viral features that prevent or evoke rnai pathway activity. a deeper understanding of these virus-specific effects will be important to defining the characteristics of an efficient arbovirus and the limitations of rnai anti-viral defense in arbovirus vectors.
