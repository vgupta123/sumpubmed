BACKGROUND
horizontal gene transfer , the process whereby genetic material is exchanged between unrelated species, has challenged our perception of evolution and the metaphors used to describe it; indeed the interplay between tree-shaped and reticulate-shaped processes provides a more realistic account of evolution, especially in prokaryotes  <cit> .

hgt is acting pervasively at the molecular level to shape the evolution in prokaryotes . to date, the vast majority of the reported cases of transfer of genetic material concern exchanges within the three domains of life, inter-domain phenomena mainly involving transfers from bacteria to archaea and from prokaryotes to eukaryotes . in contrast, dna transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes is a rare event and is mainly restricted to symbiotic or parasitic relationships . moreover, once the foreign genetic material has entered the new host via different mechanisms , intra-genomic elements come into play, notably integrons and transposases . the first three are the main mechanisms of hgt in prokaryotes .

the protein family denoted amt/mep/rh comprises ammonium transporters, methylamine permeases, and rh permeases. the biochemical function of amt proteins as nh3/nh4
+ permeases is fairly well established in bacteria, fungi and plants  <cit> , yet the substrate specificity of rh <dig> permeases, be it nh3/nh4
+, co <dig> or both, is still debated  <cit> . an appealing proposal suggested that rh proteins might act as non-specific gas channels for neutral small molecules, nh <dig>  co <dig>  and o <dig>  <cit> . along the same reasoning, depending on the cellular and/or external environmental pressures, or on the tissue/organ/species involved, the rh <dig> permease would be recruited to facilitate the transport of different gaseous substrates.

rh <dig> and amt proteins are distant homologs and are also functionally related - the latter being far from a trivial statement. indeed, the experimental evidence was obtained by demonstrating that human rh <dig> proteins could act as an ammonia channel when expressed in yeast  <cit> . the rh <dig> protein was thus identified as the long-sought ammonia channel in humans, thereby revealing that ammonia gas not only diffuses across biological membranes, as previously thought, but also needs a channel to facilitate its movement. rh <dig> was also functionally characterized as an ammonia/um permease in the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium nitrosomonas europaea  <cit> , anopheles gambiae  <cit> , mice  <cit>  and fish .

the biological role of rh <dig> and amt channels  is starting to emerge. most of the experimental evidence indicates that they increase the permeability of nh3/nh4
+ across cell membranes. this is crucial in organismal physiology, as it allows the maintenance of both ph and ammonium homeostasis, in the latter case avoiding the toxic effect of high ammonium concentrations. moreover, their role in organismal development has also been reported, and knock-out/knock-down mutants were shown to affect embryonic development in the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum  <cit>  and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , and to be essential for larval brain development and function in the tunicate ciona intestinalis  <cit> .

amt proteins are classified in two main families, amt <dig> and amt <dig>  <cit> . amt1-type proteins are specific to eukaryotes, whereas amt <dig> are mainly found in prokaryotes. yet the amt <dig> family comprises also mep proteins from fungi , as well as from other eukaryotes, namely choanoflagellida, amoebozoa, euglenozoa, stramenopiles, land plants and green algae.

while amt <dig> genes likely arose from an amt2-like ancestor followed by vertical descent, phylogenetic analyses suggest that all the eukaryotic lineages in the amt <dig> family originated from hgts events .

the presence of amt genes in prokaryotes is ubiquitous, yet most interestingly they are missing in vertebrates in which rh <dig> is present instead. rh <dig> genes  code for 50 kda proteins, hence their name; they are found, in single or multiple copies, in all eukaryotic genomes searched so far, with the notable exceptions of land plants and fungi. in the vertebrate lineage, a duplication event from an rh50-like ancestor gave origin to the fast-evolving rh <dig> genes , whose human homologs carry the rh blood-group antigens at the surface of red-cells  <cit> . the evolution of rh <dig> genes will not be dealt with here.

most interestingly, amt and rh <dig> genes coexist  in a range of eukaryotes, namely green-algae, dictyostelids, choanoflagellates as well as in metazoans such as cnidarians, nematodes, insects, cephalochordates and tunicates. yet, rh <dig> genes are extremely rare in prokaryotes; and in the only case of bacterial gene studied so far, it has been shown that the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium n. europaea acquired the rh <dig> gene via hgt  <cit> .

while the impact of hgt on the evolution of the amt families has been described in previous studies , the role of hgt in the evolution of rh <dig> in prokaryotes has not been investigated. therefore, in the present work, i have reconstructed the potential trajectories along which rh <dig> has been evolving in prokaryotes, and correlated them with ecological and metabolic niches of the organisms coding for the permease. the whole of those trajectories are defined as the rh <dig> hgt network.

here i present the analysis of four datasets supporting the role of hgt as the major driver in the evolution of rh <dig> genes in prokaryotes:  the analysis of phyletic patterns ,  the molecular phylogeny of rh <dig> proteins,  the analysis of  <dig> chromosomal neighbouring genes of rh <dig> in  <dig> genomes, and the molecular phylogenies of  <dig> of them,  the molecular phylogeny of the amt homologs.

RESULTS
the phyletic pattern of the rh <dig> genes in prokaryotes provides evidence of hgt
out of  <dig>  prokaryote genomes only  <dig> were found to code for a single copy of the rh <dig> gene, among which those of  <dig> euryarchaeal methanogens . in addition, three paralogs are present in the parabasalian eukaryote trichomonas vaginalis . the number of amt genes coded in each genome ranged from none to seven .table  <dig> phyletic patterns of rh <dig> and amt genes

next, the proportion of genomes coding for rh <dig> with respect to the number of currently sequenced genomes in the corresponding phylum was assessed. the disproportion of rh50-coding genomes is flagrant. this was found among bacteria  and among archaea . moreover, out of  <dig> planctomycetes genomes, rh <dig> genes were present only in five anaerobic-ammonia oxidizing bacteria  and out of  <dig> actinobacterial genomes, only in citricoccus sp. ch26a .

the rh <dig> phylogeny discloses several hgt trajectories in prokaryotes
provided enough taxon-sampling is available, phylogenetic analysis remains the most powerful method to detect the likely occurrence of a hgt event  <cit> .

the number of sequenced rh <dig> genes in eukaryotes is currently of several hundred . the rh <dig> dataset analysed here consisted of  <dig> taxa. because of the unexpected position of t. vaginalis , the taxon sampling of early diverging microbial eukaryotes was expanded by blast-searching the ncgr’s marine microbial eukaryote transcriptome sequencing project dataset .

prottest identified lg + Γ4 + f as the best evolutionary model fitting the data, according to all the statistics implemented. however, a cross-validation procedure favoured catgtr over lg . the rh <dig> phylogeny under the lg + Γ <dig> model was almost identical to the one inferred with catgtr + Γ <dig>  therefore an artefact due to long-branch attraction cannot account for the observed topology. for clarity of presentation and discussion, three clades in the tree are defined: the eukaryotic clade , the prokaryotic clades  and its sub-clade rh50_prok_meth .

as for the rh50_euk clade , two results are noteworthy. first, the parabasalian t. vaginalis  does not cluster with other microbial eukaryotes and in particular with the heterolobosean neagleria gruberi . second, the rh50_euk clade includes a sequence denoted proteobacteria bacterium. several lines of evidence indicate that the p. bacterium rh <dig> is a “contaminant” belonging a sister species to the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis .fig.  <dig> unrooted phylogeny of rh <dig> proteins . bayesian majority-rule consensus of  <dig>  trees obtained under the lg + Γ <dig> mixture model in phylobayes. branch-support values given at nodes are pp1/pp2/abayes/rbs/ufboot. pp1 = bayesian posterior probabilities , pp2 = bayesian posterior probabilities ; abayes = maximum likelihood bayesian-like altr transformation ; rbs = maximum likelihood rapid-bootstrap support ; ufboot = maximum likelihood ultrafast-bootstrap approximation . some clades are condensed for clarity of presentation . species oxygen requirements are denoted as follows: anaerobic , facultative , aerobic . proteobacteria bacterium jgi 0000113-e <dig> is highlighted in red. the genome of proteobacteria bacterium jgi 0000113-e <dig> is deposited at the img-jgi . several lines of evidence suggest that part of the scaffolds making up this genome belong to contaminants. the rh <dig> homolog  is present at one end of scaffold <dig> . its nearest neighbour on the scaffold , which codes for a beta-galactosidase/beta-glucuronidase, is again sister to its monosiga homolog in a bayesian phylogeny . the p. bacterium genome is issued from uncultured single-cell sequencing, and no genomic dna is available, thus experimental tests cannot be performed. the scale-bar indicates the estimated number of substitutions per site




the rh50_prok clade comprises  <dig> prokaryotes and the eukaryote t. vaginalis. the aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria  nitrosomonas and nitrosospira  form a monophyletic group, while the clostridiales  do not . the acidobacteria ca. k. versatilis is nested within the clostridiales with significant branch support. geobacter m <dig>  is consistently more closely related to the clade comprising clostridiales, anammox and rh50_prok_meth, while anaerovorax odorimutans  is sister to the clade including aob and other clostridiales.

compositional bias, found in a number of sequences, did not seem to generate any artefact . incidentally, the compositional deviation in the aerobe citricoccus is intriguing; whether this has functional implications would need to be tested experimentally.

the rh50_prok_meth clade comprises  <dig> sequences in  <dig> species, namely three euryarchaeal methanogens, t. vaginalis , the halanaerobiales clostridium acetohalobium arabaticum and the actinobacteria citricoccus. the parabasalian t. vaginalis clustered within the archaeal methanogens in both bi and ml phylogenies ; the long branch of t. vaginalis_ <dig> was always placed at the same position in the tree irrespective of the phylogenetic method used .

the rh50_prok_meth clade is also characterized by a long-branch. the site heterogeneous catgtr model is less sensitive to long-branch attraction  <cit> . phylobayes bi under the catgtr+g <dig> model recovered the sister relationship between rh50_prok_meth and anammox, whereas the lg+g <dig> model did not . two competing topologies for this clade were found: either as basal to the rh50_prok clade or as sister to the anammox. tree topology tests supported the sister relationship between rh50_prok_meth and anammox .

in summary, the phylogeny of the rh <dig> proteins has established that the rh50_prok_meth clade is sister to the anammox planctomycetes and disclosed potential scenarios for the hgt of rh <dig> amongst prokaryotes.

the phylogenies of rh <dig> chromosomal neighbours support multiple hgt scenarios in prokaryotes
several sister-taxa relationships in the rh <dig> phylogeny suggest the existence of potential hgt trajectories in the rh50_prok clade : anammox are sister to the rh_prok_meth clade, a. arabaticum to methanogens, a. arabaticum to citricoccus. the analysis of chromosomal neighbourhoods was possible thanks to the invaluable “ortholog neighbourhood viewer” tool implemented at the img-jgi. hundred and twenty-one chromosomal neighbours of the  <dig> rh <dig> genes  in  <dig> genomes were analysed . to detect potential hgt events, out of  <dig> neighbours,  <dig> proteins  showed evidence of hgt events . all phylogenies are shown in .table  <dig> phylogenetic evidence of hgt in neighbouring genes

the analysis of hgt in neighbouring genes did not lend support to any of the hgt trajectories revealed by the rh <dig> phylogeny , yet it did uncover alternative trajectories; this result is of interest as to the mode of evolution of rh <dig> in prokaryotes .

the amt phylogeny supports some of the hgt trajectories found in the rh <dig> phylogeny
additional evidence to test the hgt scenarios suggested by the phylogenetic analyses of rh <dig> genes and their chromosomal neighbours might be provided by the evolutionary history of amt genes present in those prokaryotic genomes coding for rh <dig>  the rationale behind such reasoning is that rh <dig> and amt belong to the same protein family and are also functionally related. indeed, rh <dig> has been shown to replace functionally amt in n. europaea  <cit> , and the two proteins may have complementary functions in the mosquito anopheles gambiae  <cit> . this argues in favour of a linked evolutionary history whereby the functional interplay between the two proteins may be correlated to rh50/amt duplication-transfer-loss events in different organisms.

the  <dig> genomes coding for rh <dig> genes also code for  <dig> amts ; notably, amts are absent in  <dig> genomes coding for rh <dig> . the amt phylogeny reveals the existence of several hgt events, many of which have been described in previous studies  and will not be dealt with here. instead, the amt phylogeny lends support to the potential hgt trajectories disclosed by the rh <dig> phylogeny . the topologies of different clades suggest a potential directional hgt from methanogens to anammox. more details are given in the legend of additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

tree reconciliation analysis
the presence of rh <dig> genes in a minor fraction of bacterial and archaeal genomes, both at the domain, phylum and genus levels, could be accounted for by a large number of independent gene-losses. however, this scenario is classically regarded as unlikely. the alternative and most parsimonious explanation is that prokaryotes have acquired rh <dig> genes via hgt from a eukaryotic donor. here, the main purpose of tree reconciliation analysis was to shed light on the potential “origin” of rh <dig> genes, i.e. on the directionality of gene transfer between bacteria on one side and eukaryota or eukaryota + archaea on the other. no firm conclusion can be drawn .fig.  <dig> tree reconciliation analysis. a species tree cladogram. the root was arbitrarily placed between bacteria and eukaryota + archaea. branches are numbered according to the.uts ale file. b sum of the observed frequencies of transfer from branches  leading to eukaryota, archaea and bacteria occurring in  <dig> gene phylogenies sampled from a gene tree space of  <dig>  trees. see methods for further details. aerobes were found to act as hgt donors to anaerobes more often than the other way round. branch  <dig>  leading to two euryarchaeal methanogens , is found to be the preferential donor in the hgt involving t. vaginalis. colour codes as in fig. 1





instead, the analyses suggest that  branch  <dig>  leading to two euryarchaeal methanogens  is found to be the preferential donor in the hgt involving t. vaginalis in  <dig>  of the gene trees ; and  the facultative acetivibrio cellulolyticus might have been the hgt recipient from anaerobic clostridiales .

discussion
the evolutionary history of rh <dig> genes in prokaryotes is just beginning to be unveiled. to date, no documented evidence was available for the presence of rh <dig> genes in archaea, and only the rh <dig> protein from the ammonia-oxidizing bacterium n. europaea  has been characterized as an ammonium permease  <cit> .

in the present study, i show that hgt is the driving force in the evolution and spread of rh <dig> genes in prokaryotes. while the absolute number of genomes coding for rh <dig> is expected to rise as more will be sequenced, their phylogenetic distribution is likely to remain heavily skewed. an educated guess predicts that more representatives among the firmicutes will be found. another significant finding of this study is that rh <dig> and amt genes coexist in a small number of prokaryotes .

given the available taxon sampling of bacterial and archaeal genomes, the results presented here suggest that hgt acted to spread rh <dig> yet among a restricted number of phyla and species; this formed a hgt exchange network whose main trajectories, as well as their relationship to ecological and metabolic niches, i have tried to elucidate here.

rh <dig> and amt evolution in prokaryotes: possible scenarios
amt genes are ubiquitous in both bacterial and archaeal genomes in single- or multiple-copies . remarkably, when amt is absent, in the vast majority of cases those genomes code for rh <dig> . given the pervasiveness of amt genes in prokaryotes and the corresponding rarity of rh <dig>  the likely conservation of their biochemical function as ammonium permeases and the evidence for non-orthologous displacement of amt by rh <dig> in n. europaea  <cit> , the most parsimonious hypothesis is that a duplication event from an amt ancestor is at the origin of the rh <dig> gene.

with the caveat of genome sequencing accuracy, the molecular phylogenies of rh <dig> proteins and their amt homologs and their phyletic patterns suggest three scenarios for the evolution of the amt/rh <dig> gene family in prokaryotes analysed here. in the first scenario, genomes code only for amt; this occurs in most bacteria  and archaea . in the second scenario, rh <dig>  and amt  coexist in  <dig> methanogens  and  <dig> bacteria . this is likely to be a rare event, and it may be speculated that such coexistence might have adaptive and/or ecological relevance . in the third scenario, also apparently rare, genomes code only for rh <dig> . this is the case of  <dig> prokaryotic genomes: the euryarchaeal methanogen ca. m. intestinalis,  <dig> ammonia-oxidizing bacteria , and  <dig> firmicutes .

“origin” of the rh <dig> gene
figure  <dig> shows that both eukaryotes and prokaryotes are largely monophyletic. if hgt had occurred between the two realms, the rh <dig> phylogeny would support at best only a single hgt event. alternatively, if prokaryotes had obtained their rh <dig> repeatedly from different eukaryote donor, they would be nested at different places within eukaryotes, which is not the case. an alternative scenario, the rh <dig> originating in prokaryotes, followed by extensive gene-loss in the majority of prokaryote branches seems less parsimonious. it might be argued that rh <dig> has been retained only in the few prokaryote lineages that “needed” it. this “adaptive” hypothesis may indeed hold in the case in anammox  <cit>  and in aobs. yet, it is clearly contradicted by the phyletic distribution in archaeal methanogens , for all methanogens use ammonium as source and/or by-product . the same reasoning applies to the phyletic distributions in the geobacter genus , in actinobacteria , and acidobacteria  .

although the phylogenetic analyses are not conclusive to discriminate between a prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin of rh <dig>  the results on the phylogenetic distribution of rh <dig> leaves open the possibility of a eukaryote donor . indeed, the frequency distribution of rh <dig> is proportionally exceedingly rare both within bacteria and archaea -  <dig> bacterial genomes code for a single-copy rh <dig> gene , which remarkably is also present in  <dig> euryarchaeal methanogens . moreover, the rh <dig> phyletic patterns are also strikingly uneven among prokaryotes with respect to their corresponding phylum and/or even genus. only  <dig> anammox among  <dig> planctomycete genomes encode the rh <dig> gene , only six aobs among  <dig> betaproteobacteria, and only citricoccus out of  <dig> actinobacteria . most notably, rh <dig> is present in the genome of geobacter m <dig> but it is absent in seven other geobacter genomes. lastly, rh <dig> is found in  <dig> methanogens out of  <dig> euryarchaea and  <dig> euryarchaeal methanogens; this being the first documented evidence of rh <dig> in archaeal genomes.

the case of trichomonas vaginalis
aiming at disentangling an entire hgt network would be illusory, for at best we can hope to find remnants or footprints of the hgt events which have taken place during evolutionary time, such events being characterised by different degrees of stability in the host genome. for example, the chromosomal regions upstream of the rh <dig> gene differed in clostridium papyrosolvens c <dig> and c. papyrosolvens dsm <dig> . phylogenetic  and phyletic pattern analyses identified several potential trajectories in the rh <dig> hgt network, one of which involves the parabasalian trichomonas vaginalis.

the genome of t. vaginalis codes for three rh <dig> paralogs but lacks amt genes. among the nine excavata genomes known to date, rh <dig> genes are found only in t. vaginalis and naegleria gruberi. in the rh <dig> phylogeny , while n. gruberi clusters with eukaryotes as expected, t. vaginalis is sister to methanogens. the strongly supported positioning of t. vaginalis in the phylogeny  and the tree reconciliation analysis  support the acquisition of rh <dig> from a methanogen donor. additional lines of evidence support this conclusion. in the genome of t. vaginalis, out of about  <dig>  genes, only  <dig> have no introns  <cit> , among which the rh <dig> paralogs. hundred and fifty-two potential cases of prokaryote-to-eukaryote hgt candidates were detected in the genome of t. vaginalis  <cit> , and two cases of hgt from methanogen donors were identified . in both of these genome-wide studies, the hgt of the rh <dig> gene was not detected. finally, methanogens and t. vaginalis are in physical proximity in human mucosae  <cit> .

the interesting cases of hgt involving methanogens, anammox, and acetohalobium arabaticum are discussed in greater detail in the next two sections.

rh <dig> in methanogens as an adaptation to the methylotrophic pathway
methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration and is carried out by euryarchaeal methanogens; they are a primary source of biogenic methane release in the atmosphere and are found in terrestrial, marine and freshwater sediments but also in the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and insects. all methanogens are strictly anaerobic and belong to seven euryarchaeal orders, namely methanococcales, methanobacteriales, methanopyrales, methanomicrobiales, methanocellales, methanosarcinales, and methanomassiliicoccales  <cit> . methanogen orders show different specificities with respect to their substrate for methanogenesis . to generate methane, three main pathways are used:  hydrogenotrophic ,  acetoclastic  and  methylotrophic . moreover, in general methanogens grow in syntrophic associations with fermentative bacteria producing methanogenic substrates  <cit> .

the phyletic pattern analysis of rh <dig> and amt genes in methanogens shows that only  <dig> out of  <dig> methanogen genomes code for rh <dig>  methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis, ca. m. intestinalis  and m. zhilinae , while all of them  code for amts . in the genome of these three species, rh <dig> genes are neighbours of methyltransferases, key players in the methylotrophic pathway. thus, it may be speculated that rh <dig> and methyltransferases may be co-regulated in the same operon to adapt to different growth conditions. this hypothesis is corroborated by the finding that in methanosarcina mazei genes specific to the methylotrophic pathways are co-regulated in a substrate-dependent manner  <cit>  and two amt genes  are up-regulated under nitrogen-limiting conditions  <cit> . in the case of ca. m. intestinalis, rh <dig> protein may have functionally replaced the missing amt, as in the case of the aob n. europaea  <cit> .

in methylotrophic methanogens, ammonium is known to play two roles: beneficial  and detrimental . in the methylotrophic pathway, ammonium is released during demethylation of monomethylamine. interestingly, genes involved in methanogenesis are in close chromosomal association with ammonia permeases - both rh <dig> and amt in m. luminyensis; rh <dig> in ca. m. intestinalis rh <dig> , but not with amt in ca. m. alvus  . borrel and co-workers observed this association in the three methanomassiliicoccales, and suggested that “dedicated transporters” may be involved in the export of ammonium  <cit> . moreover, methylotrophic methanogens can use ammonia as nitrogen source for amino acids synthesis  <cit> ; its potential sources being a direct uptake from the environment by ammonia permeases  and the intracellular ammonium being released during demethylation of monomethylamine.

in a wide range of ph, nh3/nh4
+ were reported to inhibit methanogenesis  <cit> , nh <dig> being more toxic than nh4
+ . it may be hypothesised that ammonia permeases  might be required to maintain ammonia homeostasis. a telling example is provided by m. zhilinae . its optimal growth occurs at ph  <dig>  and 45 °c  <cit> , conditions in which the nh3/nh4
+ equilibrium is shifted toward nh <dig>  it is possible that in m. zhilinae the excretion of toxic nh <dig> could be facilitated by rh <dig> and/or amt, similar to the role suggested for the rh <dig> proteins in the tilapia fish living in the alkaline waters  of lake magadi  <cit> .

in conclusion, there may be an adaptive correlation between rh <dig> acquisitions via hgt  and the use of the methylotrophic pathway in the hosting organisms. indeed, some of the products of the methylotrophic pathway, ch <dig>  co <dig>  and nh <dig>  could be substrates for a non-specific rh <dig> gas permease, if an increase in diffusion rate through the cell membrane were needed . the donor species  in the hgt event that allowed the three methanogens to acquire rh <dig> remains unknown, yet their sister group relationship with the acetogenic acetohalobium arabaticum in the rh <dig> tree  may suggest a possible scenario.

syntrophic associations likely favoured hgt: the cases of a. arabaticum and anammox

acetohalobium arabaticum belongs to the firmicute order of halaneorobiales. the rh <dig> phylogeny indicates a potential hgt involving a. arabaticum and the actinobacteria citricoccus, both being sister to the methanogens . a. arabaticum is a fermentative methylotrophic anaerobe that produces acetate, mono-, di- and trimethylamines  <cit> , which are substrates in methanogenic pathways. among bacteria, only a. arabaticum encodes the three mono-, di-, and trimethylamine transferases  <cit> . the gene cassette required to biosynthesize and decode uag codons as pyrrolysine  is encoded in the genomes of  <dig> prokaryotes, namely  <dig> euryarchaeota ,  <dig> firmicutes  and  <dig> deltaproteobacteria . some of them were described previously  <cit> . a. arabaticum likely acquired both pyrrolysyl-trna synthetase and methylamime transferases genes via hgt from euryarchaeal methanogens  <cit> . a. arabaticum may live in syntrophy with methanogenic euryarchaea, their physical proximity having likely facilitated hgt events.

in the anaerobic ammonia oxidizing reaction, equimolar amounts of ammonium and nitrite are converted into molecular n <dig> gas. three other aerobic steps in the biological nitrification process are performed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria  and archaea  and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria . incidentally, neither aoa nor nob encode for rh <dig> genes . likely due to their syntrophic relationships , ecological niches are known to be shared between nob and aoa, nob and aob  <cit> , as well as between anammox and methanogens  <cit>  and between anammox and aobs  <cit> . another peculiar feature of anammox organisms is the presence of a membrane-bound compartment in the cell, the anammoxosome, in which the anammox reaction is believed to take place  <cit> . the membrane of the anammoxosome contains ladderane lipids which confer high density and low permeability to the membrane thereby preventing passive diffusion of small molecular intermediates during their slow life cycle  <cit> . the rh <dig> permease is expected to enhance nh <dig> flux across dense membranes  <cit> ; therefore, the acquisition of an ammonia permease via hgt, possibly from a methanogen donor, may be regarded as adaptively advantageous to anammox. along the same line, for ammonium is a limiting factor for anammox bacteria in oxygen minimum zones, it has been suggested that the expression of high-affinity ammonium transporters  might provide a selective advantage to them  <cit> .

hgt-driven evolution may take place at boundary layers
hgt is known to occur more frequently among closely related species. likewise, organisms sharing the same ecological niche are more prone to hgt, yet inter-habitat events do occur , and barriers to hgt, such as sequence divergence and genomic gc content, can be bypassed  <cit> . in addition, the importance of environmental selection and the existence of ecologically determined gene-transfer networks enabling sharing of niche-adaptive genes has been proposed  <cit> .

here, i show that the rh <dig> hgt network is characterised by the fact that it crosses oxygen boundaries , by the rarity of genetic transfers, and by an extremely narrow taxonomic distribution of hgt events among prokaryotes.

a case in point concerns the aerobe ca. k. versatilis; in the rh <dig> tree it clusters within one of the two clades of clostridiales, which comprise typically anaerobic species . other remarkable examples of potential cross-barrier point in the rh <dig> hgt network are  the convincing trend that favours hgt of rh <dig> from aerobe to anaerobe organisms, in particular from the branch  <dig> to anaerovorax odorimutans, and from citricoccus to branch  <dig> of methanogens , and  the exchange between the facultative acetivibrio cellulolyticus and other anaerobic clostridiales .

physical and metabolic interactions between the species forming the rh <dig> hgt network have been reported, also in the form of syntrophic associations . interestingly, from the interior to the exterior layers of a sludge granule of a bioreactor, the microbial community is composed of methanogens, anammox and aob  and share an ecological niche known as oxygen minimum zone  <cit> . moreover, two putative amt proteins, expressed at the cell membrane of the anammox scalindua profunda, might be involved in ammonium scavenging  <cit> , which in turn could provide n <dig> source to aobs and/or methanogens.

to sum up, the main trajectories of the rh <dig> hgt network point to a still much unexplored ecological niche where hgt might be enhanced, namely the oxic-anoxic boundary layers, such as the oxygen minimum zones . indeed, the hgt of periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase genes between anammox and the aerobic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria nitrospina has been reported to occur in marine omz  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic analyses presented here, and data from the literature, identify several potential trajectories in the rh <dig> hgt evolutionary network in prokaryotes, a striking feature of which is that it seems to cross oxygen boundaries. the most “informative” nodes of the network are methanogens, acetohalobium arabaticum, anaerobic and aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria . their relationships suggest that  syntrophic relationships play a major role in the development of the network, and  oxygen minimum zones -and boundary layers in general — might be an ecological niche of crucial importance for hgt-driven evolution.

the present findings pave the way to two types of experimental investigations. the presence of rh <dig> in such a restricted spectrum of archaea is puzzling. rh <dig> is found in both m. luminyensis and ca. m. intestinalis but the latter lacks amt; both share the same niche in animal digestive tracts. detailed functional and structural studies of these two rh <dig> proteins might reveal the nature and origin of adaptive changes. similar insights might be gained by comparative structure/function analysis of the rh <dig> and amt proteins from organisms in which they coexist, namely anammox, and the methanogens m. luminyensis and m. zhilinae. finally, genome and transcriptome comparisons between organisms inhabiting oxygen minimum zones will clarify the role of this ecological niche in promoting hgt-driven evolution.
