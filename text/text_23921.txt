BACKGROUND
it is well established that the generation of new neurons continues throughout adulthood in the dg in many species of vertebrates  <cit> . the neuronal cell proliferation in the dg is regulated by several physiological factors, including enriched environments  <cit> , running  <cit>  and learning  <cit> . reportedly, such pathological states as lesion and ischemia may result in cell birth in the hippocampal dg  <cit> . elegant studies in multiple labs have described the maturation of newborn cells in the subgranular region of dg and their eventual incorporation into mature physiologically active dentate granule neurons  <cit> . after transient forebrain ischemia, newly generated neurons migrate and incorporate into functional synaptic circuitry, which provides a possible therapeutic strategy for ischemic injury repair  <cit> . the identification of intracellular signaling events that regulate the rate of ischemia-induced progenitor cell proliferation is therefore of significant interest.

the src family kinases  are a family of proteins that have been implicated in relaying signals as downstream of a wide variety of cell-surface receptors to regulate diverse cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, survival changes in cellular architecture, and regulating cell adhesion and migration  <cit> . five members of sfks  are known to be expressed in the mammalian brain  <cit> , of which src, fyn, and yes have been detected in the developing brain  <cit> . furthermore, differentiating rodent neurons express a high level of src, which is identified as being important in growth cone-mediated neurite extension, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal differentiation  <cit> . the increment in src kinase activity observed during the development of striatum and hippocampus is coincident with the peak period of neurogenesis and neuronal growth  <cit> . nevertheless, its association with ischemia-induced neuronal cell proliferation in the hippocampal dg and potential signal transduction has not been explored.

one signaling cascade implicated in regulating the proliferative capacity of adult stem cells is mitogen-activated protein kinase   <cit> . the extracellular signal-regulated kinase  is a subfamily member of mapk activated by an upstream kinase called mapkkk /erk kinase  in response to growth stimuli  <cit> . much evidence exists that the erk pathway plays a role in progenitor cell proliferation or differentiation in a number of model systems mediated by alterations of nuclear transcription factors  <cit> . for example, the erk pathway is involved in neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal survival induced by neurotrophic factors  <cit>  and pharmacon like valproate  <cit>  or lithium  <cit> . meanwhile, mapkkk  is reported to be potently phosphorylated by src kinase at tyr340/ <dig> residue in mammalian cells, relieving its autoinhibition  <cit> . no data to date is available regarding the question whether erk triggers cell proliferation after ischemia in the dg region of hippocampus as well as the role of src kinase in the process.

non-receptor tyrosine kinase src plays prominent roles in ischemic cerebral apoplexy  <cit> . ischemic challenge particularly results in a sustained activation of the src family ptks  in the rat hippocampus  <cit> . in this study, we propose that sustained activation of src kinases plays a key role in progenitor cell proliferation via raf/erk/creb cascades in hippocampal dentate gyrus after transient cerebral ischemia.

RESULTS
src kinase was sustainedly activated in the hippocampal dg following ischemia-reperfusion and its inhibitor su <dig> prevented ischemia-induced neuronal cell proliferation
our previous studies indicated that cerebral ischemia induced sustained activation of src kinase following ischemia in the hippocampus  <cit> . in the present study, we further assessed the activity of src kinase of dg/ca <dig> subfield after  <dig> h reperfusion post-ischemia. based on that the phosphorylation of src c-terminal tyr- <dig> residue expresses a down-regulated kinase state, anti-src tyr <dig> antibody was employed, as exhibited in fig. 1a , the activity of src remained in a high level until  <dig> h and  <dig> h reperfusion illustrated by strong dephosphorylation of src at tyr <dig> site compared with sham operated animals. it suggested that continuous src kinase activation may be involved in triggering some pathological phenomena in the dg/ca <dig> region induced by ischemia and reperfusion. as has been well accepted, ischemia stimulates neurogenesis in the dg; thus we explored the possibility of src being involved in the proliferation of adult hippocampal progenitor cells. su <dig>  an inhibitor of src kinases, was administered into cerebral ventricle before ischemia, and found to be effective in suppressing src activity . on day  <dig> post ischemia, the number of brdu-positive cells was shown to be approximately 4-fold larger in the ischemic group than that in the sham group. brdu-labeled cells in each group were located exclusively in the sgz in clusters . importantly, we demonstrated that su <dig> decreased the number of brdu - positive cells after ischemia . the solvent had no influence on the number of brdu-positive cells on the 7th post-ischemic day as opposed to the ischemic group . based on the results, we surmise that src kinases may be implicated in the ischemia-induced cell proliferation in the hippocampal dg.

su <dig> inhibit raf /erk/creb cascade in the dg after ischemia
for a better understanding of the down-stream signaling mechanism of src on cell proliferation stimulated by ischemia, some signaling proteins relating to growth like erk or creb were examined in the following way. first, we attempted to see whether the alteration of src kinases affected the ischemia-induced erk activity in the areas of ca <dig> and dg. we selected two time spots . at both spots the amount of p-erk increased at least two-fold when compared with sham control group; while the elevated level of p-erk lowered in the su <dig> - treated rats , and the solvent group showed no change in the phosphorylation of erk after ischemia and reperfusion. these results suggest that erk phosphorylation in the dg region triggered by ischemia depends on src activation. to further explore how src kinase induced erk activation, we examined the effects of su <dig> on raf activity in ca <dig> and dg fields following ischemia. raf, an up-stream kinase of erk, is thought to be activated by its tyr340/ <dig> - phosphorylation. as demonstrated in , drastic phosphorylation of raf at these residues was observed after  <dig> h and  <dig> h reperfusion. su <dig>  rather than the solvent, markedly attenuated the effect , indicating that src kinase may trigger the activation of erk via phosphorylation of raf at its tyr340/ <dig> residues after ischemia and reperfusion. besides, another protein creb, a transcription factor involved in the cell proliferation in various models, was assessed. the phosphorylated level of creb  grew after the  <dig> h and  <dig> h reperfusions respectively, but strikingly down-regulated at both time spots in the group of su <dig>  the vehicle-treated group kept unchanged , suggesting a role of creb in src-dependent cell proliferation after ischemia. on the other hand, the presence of the su <dig> and its solvent did not alter the level of total erk, raf and creb proteins . therefore, our study revealed the involvement of src kinase in the regulation of raf/erk and creb cascade in the dg fields after ischemia.

u <dig> block generation of new neurons in the dg through inhibition of erk/creb cascade after cerebral ischemia
to determine whether erk pathway participate in cell proliferation of dg induced by ischemia, we used u <dig> as its inhibitor after being infused into bilateral cerebral ventricle, and it turned out to be effective in depressing erk activity . consistent with our expectation, we demonstrated that u <dig> had a similar effect on su <dig>  which significantly decreased the number of brdu-labeled cells in the sgz of dg field  <dig> days after ischemia . the solvent of the u <dig> group did not change the number of new born neurons following ischemia-reperfusion. these results indicate that su <dig> inhibited cell proliferation through down-regulated phosphorylation of erk in the dg field. subsequently, we observed the effects of u <dig> on creb activation after ischemia-reperfusion in the fields of ca <dig> and dg. the data showed that rats treated with u <dig> before ischemia had lower phosphorylated level of creb, in comparison with the  <dig> h reperfusion rats , suggesting that creb might be contributed to erk dependent neural cell proliferation after ischemia. activities of src and raf after u <dig> treatment in the dg following ischemia showed that down-regulation of erk had no relation to src and raf phosphorylation on these very residues at the time period of maximum stimulation of src/raf , further proving that src/raf cascade was an upstream mediator for erk activation. the solvent of u <dig> exhibited no alterations on phosphorylation of erk, src, raf and creb after  <dig> h reperfusion, and no variation was detected in the total erk, src, raf and creb level in all the groups . the above results are suggestive of a key role of src-stimulating raf /erk/creb pathway in the ischemia-induced hippocampal cell proliferation.

neurons of dg subfields are resistant to ischemia injury, and activation of src but not erk promote delayed neuronal death of ca <dig> region
transient global cerebral ischemia leads to neuronal death of hippocampus. to investigate whether survival of hippocampal neurons was affected by su <dig> or u <dig>  nissl staining was performed to detect hippocampal neurons in the rats subjected to  <dig> days of reperfusion following ischemia . under a light microscope, the normal neurons showed round cell bodies and plain stained nuclei . after  <dig> days of reperfusion following brain ischemia, though the regions of ca <dig> and dg were shown to be the same as in the sham group and no damaged cell was detectable, a prominent neuronal loss was observed and the few pyramidal neurons left were shrunken with pyknotic nuclei in the hippocampal ca <dig> region . however, administration with su <dig> before ischemia markedly increased the survival of neurons in the hippocampal ca <dig> region , while infusion of u <dig>  or the solvent  did not alleviate post-ischemic cell death. statistical analysis of neuronal density for each group is shown in . besides increasing cell proliferation of dg, activation of src also participated in pyramidal cell death in ca <dig> triggered by ischemia, but src/raf/erk cascade only explained the new cell birth in the dg.

discussion
cerebral ischemia insults have been shown to trigger proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells or progenitor cells located in the hippocampal dentate gyrus  <cit> , and the number of neuronal stem cells increased obviously 5-7d after ischemia  <cit> . the pathological mechanism of ischemia is regulated by a variety of protein tyrosine kinases. some of these kinases, including fgf, bdnf and ngf receptors, have been reported to be involved in ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis  <cit> . however, the roles of non receptor tyrosine kinases  remain unclear. an earlier study reported that activation of src kinase is related to hippocampal neurogenesis beginning in late embryonic life and continuing for some period of time after birth  <cit> . recent studies indicate that src activation is required for muscarinic receptor-mediated dna synthesis and cell proliferation in neural precursor cells  <cit> . interestingly, our present findings demonstrated that cerebral ischemia stimulated a sustained activation of src kinase in the dg region, and su <dig>  the src specific inhibitor, significantly decreased the number of brdu - positive cells of dg after  <dig> days of reperfusion . thus, we suppose that src activation following stroke insult is responsible for ischemia-induced cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus.

the molecular mechanism underlying src kinase dependent neural cell proliferation stimulated by ischemia is complex. signals that increase intracellular ca2+ concentration serve as a main contributing factor for activation of src  <cit> , which, as a cytoplasmic non receptor tyrosine kinase, acts like a relay station that transmits various signals to their specific targeted downstream molecules to modulate transcriptional activation and mitogenesis. under some conditions, erk has been demonstrated as one of the key downstream signals of src kinase. the problem is whether erk participates in the generation of new adult progenitor cells or not and whether its role is positive or negative, which awaits further exploration. our previous studies showed that cerebral ischemia stimulated a sustained activation of erk in the dg field of hippocampus  <cit> , and in the present study the elevation was found lasting at least  <dig> h after ischemia , which is roughly coincident with activation of src kinase . several studied have demonstrated that both erk and src immunoreactivity were enhanced in the dg after ischemic insult  <cit> , suggesting that there may exists a relationship between the two. this presumption is supported by the detection of raf, the well accepted erk cascades upstream kinase, whose residues tyr 340/ <dig> are directly phosphorylated by src after ischemia , and it is consistent with the view from alavi  <cit> . while recent findings suggested that erk signaling participated in hypoxia-induced neurogenesis in vitro  <cit> , in this study, our data showed that blocking the activation of erk diminished the ischemia-promoted increase in adult hippocampal progenitor cells of rats , and it further proved that erk was of great significance in mediating cell proliferation the dg. taken together, it is convincing to suggest that src participating in the regeneration of adult hippocampal progenitor cells triggered by ischemia is through mediating the raf/erk cascades. creb is a basic leucine zipper family transcription factor that mediates diverse responses in the nervous system  <cit> . our data showed that ischemia also caused continuous activation of creb in the dg region of hippocampus , and inhibition of src/raf/erk pathway by su <dig> and u <dig>  both of which significantly decreased the p-creb level . meanwhile, there is abundant evidence that creb is involved in the progress of differentiation and survival, as well as proliferation, of progenitor cells in adult hippocampus  <cit> . more importantly, some recent studies in rats demonstrated that activation of creb after cerebral ischemia stimulated cell proliferation in the adult dg  <cit> . our results indicated that both src- and erk- dependent proliferations of adult hippocampal progenitor cells were mediated by activation of creb, and provided further proof that src/raf/erk cascade was involved in neural cell proliferation evoked by ischemia in dg.

in addition, ischemia insult may also trigger others molecular pathways, which may associate with altering proliferation of progenitor cells. the results  showed there was a distinction between blockage of p - src and that of p - erk in the number of dg brdu-labeling cells, indicating that beside raf/erk cascade, there might be some other factors triggered by src getting involved in this event, such as pi3k/akt pathway which has also been known to be activated by src kinase following ischemia/reperfusion in various organs, and plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival  <cit> . on the other hand, one possible mechanism underlying brain ischemia-induced proliferation of neural progenitors is stimulation of tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors by induction of growth factors such as fgf, bdnf and ngf  <cit> . brain ischemia-induced cell proliferation is triggered by erk activation through expression of growth factors and cognate receptors in the dg  <cit> . this report may be explain the phenomenon in our results, creb phosphorylation is still considerably up-regulated even after su <dig> inhibition compared to the control, and the effects of u <dig> upon creb is much more remarkable. but how these molecular signals concordantly regulate each other, and their contribution in the birth of progenitor cells are unknown, which remain further research.

it is generally accepted that the region of dg is relatively resistant to ischemic injury. our result also validated that there is no ischemia - induced neuronal death in the dg fields . thus we assume that sustained activation of src kinase may not interfere with survival of neurons in dg fields after ischemia. however, cerebral ischemia triggers neuronal death in ca <dig> of hippocampus, and our data suggested src activation also played a key role in ca <dig> pyramidal cell death after ischemia . we are therefore confused about which was the key factor in stimulating cell proliferation of dg region, src kinase or neuronal damage in ca <dig>  as both regions of dg and ca <dig> were related to activation of src but with different kinds of neuronal destiny after ischemia. considering that blockage of activation of erk did not reduce neuronal death rate of ca <dig> fields , we suppose that the proliferation of adult progenitor cells in dg is not directly related to injury in the ca <dig> region evoked by ischemia, and that the different fates of neurons suffering ischemia between dg and ca <dig> are determined by different signaling pathway-dependent activations of src kinase. what's more, the raf/erk/creb cascade only mediates cell proliferation of dg but has no association with neuronal death of ca <dig> after ischemia.

CONCLUSIONS
following cerebral ischemic insults, the marked stimulation of neuronal cell proliferation by src mechanisms in the dentate gyrus is partly mediated through the cascade from ca2+ influx to raf/erk activation, and then to creb phosphorylation, which, in turn, triggers genes related to cell proliferation expression .
