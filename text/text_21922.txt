BACKGROUND
an estimated  <dig> in  <dig> people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma  in their lifetime and 5-year survival rates are only approximately 34%  <cit> . despite several recent therapeutic advances, patients with mm still have significant unmet medical need, especially those who fail frontline therapy.

vdc- <dig>  formerly referred to as gs- <dig>  is a double prodrug of acyclic nucleotide phosphonate 9- guanine , which was designed to preferentially deliver and accumulate pmeg and its active phosphorylated metabolite, pmeg disphosphate  in lymphoid cells while avoiding systemic exposure of pmeg  <cit> . the delivery of pmeg/pmegpp results in cytotoxicity due to inhibition of nuclear dna polymerases α, δ and ϵ  <cit> . pmeg’s clinical utility is limited by poor cellular permeability as well as gastrointestinal and renal toxicity  <cit> . vdc- <dig>  however, is hydrolyzed intracellularly to 9--n6-cyclopropyl- <dig> -diaminopurine , deaminated to pmeg and then rapidly converted to pmegpp  <cit> . in normal laboratory dogs, vdc- <dig> selectively depletes replicating lymphoid tissues at doses which spare most other tissues, and demonstrates significant antineoplastic activity in dogs with naturally occurring non-hodgkin’s lymphoma   <cit> . vdc- <dig> is currently under development as a therapeutic agent for canine cancer.

the evaluation of novel agents in dogs with naturally occurring cancers, especially lymphoid neoplasia, can offer significant insight into an agent’s potential for treatment of human cancers; dogs have similar responses to standard chemotherapeutic agents, an intact immune system, and biologic similarity to humans  <cit> . as in people, canine mm is initially responsive to chemotherapy; however, recurrence of drug-resistant disease occurs commonly, with median survival durations of approximately  <dig> months following melphalan-based chemotherapy. long-term relapse-free survival is exceedingly rare  <cit> .

given the encouraging antitumor activity observed in dogs with nhl and owing to the similarity in lineage between b-cell nhl and mm, we sought to determine if vdc- <dig> possessed in vitro antiproliferative activity against human mm-derived cells and clinical activity in naturally occurring canine mm.

RESULTS
in vitro antiproliferative effects
vdc- <dig> and its bioactive metabolites cprpmedap and pmeg dose-dependently inhibited growth of h- <dig>  rpmi- <dig> and u- <dig> human mm cell lines with ic50s between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm. the ic50s observed with vdc- <dig> were roughly the same as those observed with cprpmedap and pmeg, suggesting that mm cells possessed the enzymatic machinery necessary to perform the hydrolysis and deamination of vdc- <dig> , and are in keeping with the range of in vitro ic <dig> reported for other human hematopoietic cell lines  <cit> .

 <dig> 
in vivo treatment and outcome
fourteen dogs with mm were enrolled prospectively in a clinical trial of vdc- <dig> monotherapy, which was administered according to  <dig> of  <dig> schedules. patient and disease characteristics are reported in table  <dig>  the  <dig> pretreated dogs all received and subsequently developed progressive disease while receiving melphalan and prednisone, and one had additionally failed vad  therapy.

response to therapy was assessed utilizing an adaptation of the international uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma   <cit> . three dogs were not evaluable for response to therapy:  <dig> dogs were euthanized  <dig> and  <dig> days following their first treatment of vdc- <dig> owing to development of acute transverse myelopathy , and  <dig> dog had light chain disease only and thus paraprotein was not quantifiable. these three dogs were included in outcome analysis on an intent-to-treat basis, and their outcomes treated as events for the purposes of pfi and st calculations. of the remaining  <dig> dogs,  <dig> experienced stringent complete responses  and  <dig> experienced partial responses , for an overall response rate of 82%. serial measurements of paraprotein in the  <dig> evaluable dogs are depicted in figure  <dig>  and pre- and post-treatment bone marrow plasma cell percentages are provided in table  <dig> 

nb: patient am’s myeloma diagnosis was made based on hypercalcemia, monoclonal gammopathy and the presence of multiple bony lytic lesions on radiographs.

dogs presented with a variety of mm-associated hematologic and biochemical abnormalities, most of which resolved or substantially improved in response to vdc- <dig> monotherapy . the notable exception was azotemia, which tended not to improve.

 <dig> dogs were considered censored in the pfi analysis owing to euthanasia for unrelated reasons , ongoing cr  or loss to follow-up . the median follow-up time in censored patients was  <dig> days. the median overall pfi was  <dig> days , and the median pfi in patients experiencing pr or scr was  <dig> days . the median pfi was not reached in patients experiencing scr and  <dig> days in patients experiencing pr; this difference was not statistically significant . there was no statistical difference in response rate or pfi between dogs receiving vdc- <dig> once every  <dig> days and those receiving other schedules . one dog was re-treated with vdc- <dig> at the time of relapse  and one dog went on to receive additional specific antineoplastic therapy following vdc- <dig> therapy . the overall median st was  <dig> days. this number is less than the median pfi owing to differential censorship of some patients in pfi and st calculations.

of note,  <dig> dog that had failed previous therapy with prednisone and melphalan experienced a scr following  <dig> treatments with vdc- <dig> and was euthanized  <dig> days following treatment initiation owing to the development of an unrelated neoplasm . there was no gross or histologic evidence of mm on necropsy in this dog. representative bone marrow photomicrographs and results of parr from this dog are presented in figure  <dig>  a second dog remains alive and in scr >300 days following treatment initiation.

safety and adverse events
adverse events were transient and self-limiting in most dogs and are described in table  <dig>  the single episode of grade  <dig> neutropenia occurred after the first dose and was not accompanied by fever. in this dog, significant neutropenia  was present prior to treatment and normalized with continued therapy. dermatopathy was noted in  <dig> dogs , and consisted most commonly of focal mild otitis or pruritic and erythematous skin lesions on the dorsum. the skin lesions resolved with standard of care therapy including topical treatments and systemic analgesics and antibiotics as needed. a 1-week dose delay was instituted for one dog for management of dermatopathy. two dogs developed severe dyspnea  <dig> and  <dig> days following treatment initiation, which led to euthanasia owing to respiratory signs. both of these dogs were experiencing prs at the time of euthanasia, and pulmonary fibrosis was confirmed on necropsy.

postmortem examinations were performed in  <dig> dogs. extensive infiltration of plasma cells into bone marrow and parenchymatous organs was demonstrated in  <dig> dogs. one dog demonstrated hepatic fibrosis and  <dig> had renal changes . the aforementioned diffuse pulmonary fibrosis was noted in  <dig> dogs, and a third dog had a focal area of lung fibrosis admixed with malignant plasma cells.

discussion
despite advances and development of novel anti-mm agents such as immunomodulators, bisphosphonates and proteasome inhibitors  <cit> , conventional and novel cytotoxic agents likely will continue to play an important role in mm management  <cit> . vdc- <dig>  novel prodrug of the guanine nucleotide analog pmeg, has significant antitumor activity and acceptable tolerability in dogs with nhl  <cit> . based on similarities in nhl and mm lineage and similarities between canine and human mm, we investigated the activity of vdc- <dig> in dogs with naturally occurring mm.

vdc- <dig> exhibited dose-dependent antiproliferative activity against  <dig> human mm cell lines, with ic <dig> values in the range of those reported against other human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, supporting the evaluation of vdc- <dig> in dogs with mm. clear and significant antitumor activity was demonstrated with vdc- <dig> by clinicopathologic assessment of serum paraproteins, bone marrow cytology, and a sensitive pcr-based assay for detecting clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, as well as normalization or substantial improvement in a variety of mm-associated clinicopathologic abnormalities. notably, a complete and exceptionally durable scr was observed in a dog with melphalan-refractory myeloma, which is rarely observed in dogs with mm  <cit> , and a second scr is ongoing at >300 days. additionally, mm is generally treated continuously in both dogs and humans. the fact that durable scrs have been observed and maintained following  <dig> doses of vdc- <dig> without any maintenance therapy is likewise encouraging.

the activity observed in both untreated and melphalan-refractory patients indicates potential utility for vdc- <dig> in both induction and rescue chemotherapy settings. given the lack of any obvious schedule-dependency on response rates or durations, a dosage of  <dig>  mg/kg vdc- <dig> free base  as a 30-minute iv infusion once every  <dig> days is recommended for further study.

acute adverse events were transient and manageable, and consistent with those described in normal dogs and in dogs with nhl treated with gs- <dig>  <cit> . severe pulmonary fibrosis leading to euthanasia was identified in  <dig> dogs experiencing pr. this phenomenon has been observed previously in a small percentage of dogs with nhl treated with vdc- <dig>  typically several months following treatment discontinuation  <cit> . the observance of this adverse event in nhl patients led us to pursue concurrent low-dose prednisone therapy in one patient treated in this study. future studies will investigate the ability of concurrent corticosteroids to mitigate this serious adverse event, and careful monitoring of thoracic radiographs and assessment for pulmonary signs is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, vdc- <dig> exhibits substantial activity against naïve and refractory mm in dogs, with acceptable toxicity. pulmonary fibrosis can be observed in some mm patients treated with vdc- <dig>  and patients should be closely monitored for this adverse effect.
