BACKGROUND
since the discovery of the production of antibiotics by the filamentous fungus penicillium chrysogenum by fleming in  <dig>  <cit> , much effort has been invested in selection and synthesis of strains with improved productivity  <cit> . this research has made decisive contributions to the successful large-scale production of β-lactam antibiotics after world war ii. after isolation of the high-producing wild-type p. chrysogenum strain nrrl  <dig> from a cantaloupe  <cit> , random mutagenesis with irradiation or chemicals, followed by selection for superior production strains, enabled an over 1000-fold increase of penicillin productivity  <cit> .

the penicillin biosynthesis pathway has been well characterized both genetically and biochemically. biosynthesis starts with the condensation of the three amino acids cysteine, valine and α-aminoadipic acid to form the tripeptide acv. this reaction is catalyzed by the non-ribosomal peptide synthase acvs encoded by pcbab  <cit> . in the next step, the classic β-lactam ring structure is formed by isopenicillinn synthase   <cit> . isopenicillinn forms the branch point for the penicillins and cephalosporins. penicillins can be easily produced from isopenicillinn by the exchange of the α-aminoadipic acid moiety for a coa activated side-chain, such as phenylacetic acid or phenoxyacetic acid, by acyl-coa: isopenicillinn acyltransferase , which results in the production of penicilling or penicillinv  <cit> . these three biosynthesis genes were shown to be physically linked in a penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster   <cit> . present as a single copy in early strains, this gene cluster was shown to be present as amplified tandem repeats in later, high-producing strains  <cit> . although increases in copy number have indeed been shown to result in improved productivity, saturation occurs at very high copy numbers  <cit> , presumably due to limitations elsewhere in metabolism. in p. chrysogenum the biosynthesis pathway is compartmentalised. the enzymes involved in the first steps of biosynthesis, acvs and ipns, are localised in the cytosol, whereas the final steps, acyltransferase and the activation of the side-chain precursor by phenylacetyl-coa ligase, take place in peroxisomes  <cit> .

with some exceptions , the molecular basis for high-level β-lactam production remains to be elucidated. several cellular processes have been implicated in improved productivity, including a better utilisation of precursors, higher expression of biosynthesis genes, higher gene dosage and mutations in the regulatory genes controlling gene expression or other steps of the biosynthesis  <cit> . for rational and successful metabolic engineering, identification of these mutations will be of extreme benefit. with the availability of the p. chrysogenum genome sequence  <cit> , it is now possible to study penicilling production at a genome-wide scale.

penicilling production requires an exchange of the α-aminoadipic acid side-chain of isopenicillinn for the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid   <cit> . paa is a weak acid  and as such is likely to be toxic to cells depending on its concentration and the culture ph. such toxicity may involve specific inhibitory effects of paa on key enzymes in biomass or penicilling production or, alternatively, more general mechanisms such as weak-acid uncoupling  <cit> . penicilling producing p. chrysogenum can metabolise paa via at least two routes: incorporation in the penicilling molecule or catabolism via the homogentisate pathway to acetoacetate and fumarate  <cit> . although this catabolic route has been described in p. chrysogenum  <cit>  little is known about the pleiotropic effects of paa on p. chrysogenum. only a few studies dedicated to the uptake of paa have been reported and these show contrasting results. hillenga et al.  <cit>  and eriksen et al.  <cit>  both suggest that in production strains, and at moderate concentrations of paa, this side-chain precursor enters the cell by simple diffusion across the plasma membrane. in contrast, at low external paa concentrations, a high-affinity transporter has been proposed to contribute to paa uptake by the wisconsin54- <dig> strain  <cit> .

the specific rate of β-lactam production by p. chrysogenum is strongly dependent on the availability of a suitable side-chain precursor. in many studies on the physiological impact of β-lactam production, a comparison is made between cultures grown in the absence and presence of a side-chain precursor   <cit> . while this approach has contributed to our insight in the energetics and kinetics of penicilling production, it does not allow a clear distinction between effects caused by, on one hand, β-lactam production and, on the other hand, paa consumption and/or toxicity. a suitable experimental approach would be to compare two strains with similar backgrounds under well-defined culture conditions by using chemostat cultures, in which one strain would only be lacking the penicillin biosynthesis cluster.

mutants of p. chrysogenum impaired in penicillin biosynthesis have been described  <cit> . most of these mutants were derived by random mutagenesis from the low-producing strain wisconsin54- <dig>  which contains one copy of the penicillin biosynthesis cluster. although these mutants were very useful for studying gene expression and gene/enzyme relationships, for identification of the factors important for penicilling production and paa consumption a strain obtained from a high-producing strain background by targeted deletion is more beneficial. to this end we constructed a strain in which the tandem-repeated penicillin biosynthesis cluster was specifically deleted, whereas the strain background was retained. in such a way it is possible to identify, by a combinatorial approach, those genes affected by phenylacetic acid and those specifically important for penicilling biosynthesis.

RESULTS
generation of a penicillin gene cluster-free derivative of a penicilling high-producing penicillium chrysogenum strain
to enable studies on the genome-wide impact of penicilling biosynthesis in penicillium chrysogenum, penicillin gene clusters  were removed from the penicilling high-producing strain p. chrysogenum ds <dig>  since the β-lactam gene amplifications are in direct repeats of a larger amplified region on the same chromosome  <cit>  spontaneous recombinations between different repeats can result in loss of gene cluster copies  <cit> . isolates that underwent spontaneous recombinations were obtained via protoplast formation and subsequent sporulation of regenerating colonies.  <dig> random isolates were selected for southern analysis to estimate the relative gene copy numbers of the penicillin biosynthesis gene pcbc and the single-copy niaa gene . the same strains were tested for penicillinv production in shake-flask cultures grown on mineral medium with the side-chain precursor phenoxyacetic acid. half of the random isolates tested had both reduced pcbc:niaa ratio's and reduced penicillinv titres. one selected strain was subjected to a second round of protoplast formation and screening. again,  <dig> random isolates were selected and analysed . several putative single-copy penicillin gene cluster candidates  were identified based on a similar pcbc:niaa ratio to that of the single-copy wisconsin54- <dig> strain  <cit> . three of these strains were tested in for penicillinv production, with the parental p. chrysogenum ds <dig> parent, the intermediate parent ds <dig>  the laboratory strain wisconsin54- <dig> and a non-producing isolate of the latter strain, npe <dig>  <cit> , as controls. all three isolates showed a drastically reduced penicillinv titre, comparable to that of the single-copy strain wisconsin54- <dig>  it was therefore assumed that these three isolates are derivatives of p. chrysogenum ds <dig> that carry a single copy of the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster . to delete the last remaining copy of the penicillin gene cluster, a double homologous recombination strategy was applied. sequences adjacent to the β-lactam biosynthetic gene cluster  were used as homologous flanking sequences to target the amds selection marker to this locus and to delete the entire 17-kb region containing the cluster of β-lactam biosynthetic genes  in the same integration event. homologous integration by double crossover will generate transformants able to use acetamide as the sole nitrogen source  but unable to produce any penicillins. moreover, genomic dna of strains that have undergone a successful double crossover should not hybridise to β-lactam gene specific probes. of  <dig>  transformants tested,  <dig>  gave no inhibition zone when overlaid with a penicillin sensitive e. coli strain and were selected for further analyses. all  <dig> putative mutants were negative in the diagnostic pcr for the β-lactam biosynthetic gene pende. two of these strains gave no signal for amds, suggesting that they had spontaneously lost the marker gene. southern analysis of the obtained p. chrysogenum strains was subsequently carried out. as a probe, a dna fragment of 425-bp from the pcbab 3'-flanking sequence was pcr amplified . all strains with intact penicillin biosynthesis gene sequences  showed a  <dig> -kb band in case of digestion with hindiii while putative β-lactam cluster-free ds <dig> derivatives showed a  <dig> -kb band . to confirm their inability to biosynthesize β-lactams all  <dig> mutants were inoculated in liquid mineral medium with phenylacetic acid as precursor. indeed, none of the mutants was capable of producing penicilling . it was concluded that all  <dig> strains are derivatives of the p. chrysogenum ds <dig> strain in which all copies of the penicillin gene cluster have been deleted. isolate ds <dig> was used as cluster-free strain in this study.

physiology of a penicilling high-producing strain and a cluster-free derivative in chemostat cultures
the high-producing ds <dig> strain and the cluster-free strain  were grown in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  in the presence and absence of the penicilling side-chain precursor paa. for each combination of strain and paa presence or absence, at least three independent chemostat cultures were analysed. in the absence of paa, no penicilling was produced by the ds <dig> strain; however intermediates such as isopenicillinn were still produced  <cit> . under the same conditions, the cluster-free strain did not produce any β-lactam intermediates. the small difference between the biomass yields cultures of the high-producing and cluster-free strains grown in the presence of paa confirms an earlier report  <cit>  that penicilling biosynthesis imposes an energetic burden on p. chrysogenum. however, the paa-induced reduction of the biomass yield of the cluster-free strain  suggests that part of the biomass yield decrease that is observed upon induction of penicilling production by paa addition  <cit> , may in fact be caused by the side-chain-precursor paa itself, e.g. via uncoupling of the plasma membrane  <cit> .

although paa could not be used for penicilling production in the cluster-free strain, it was still consumed at circa 25% of the rate observed in the ds <dig> strain. the paa consumption rate in the cluster-free strain corresponded quantitatively to the paa consumption that was not incorporated into penicilling in the high-producing strain . as reported previously for industrial strains of p. chrysogenum, this could be the result of oxidation to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid by phenylacetate hydroxylase and subsequent catabolism via the homogentisate pathway  <cit> .

experimental design of transcriptome analysis and global gene expression responses to penicilling production and paa consumption
genome-wide transcriptome analysis was carried out on mycelium of both strains grown in glucose-limited chemostat cultures in the presence and absence of paa at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  the average coefficient of variation of the transcriptome data derived from independent triplicate cultures did not exceed  <dig>  , which is similar to the reproducibility obtained with chemostat cultures of the non-filamentous yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . the level of the acta  <cit>  and gdh <dig> transcripts, which are commonly used loading standards for .northern analysis, varied by less than 14% over the four situations tested. chemostat experiments were designed to dissect gene expression responses to paa and penicilling production. addition of paa to growing ds <dig> strain may induce two types of responses. firstly, the presence of paa itself may affect cellular processes outside β-lactam biosynthesis and thus affect the transcriptome of the fungus. secondly, availability of a side-chain precursor enables the penicilling formation, thus resulting in the induction and/or repression of the transcription of genes that are directly related to β-lactam production. to dissect these two types of responses, we used the cluster-free strain ds <dig> as a filter for the paa response, as this strain neither produces penicilling nor intermediates. comparison of the transcript data of the two strains grown under the same conditions  will provide information on the effect of the removal of the penicillin cluster  .

in total, four pair-wise comparisons between the two strains and the two conditions were performed , yielding a total of  <dig> transcripts  that were differentially expressed in at least one of the comparisons based on the statistical criteria applied in this study . the majority of the genome  did not show significant changes between the four conditions and transcript levels of 30% of the genome  was below the detection limit in all four situations .

the set of differentially expressed genes was distributed over  <dig> groups following a two-way comparison  . groups  <dig> and  <dig>  contained genes whose transcript levels were consistently higher or lower in the presence of paa, irrespective of the strain background. similarly, groups  <dig> and  <dig> harboured genes whose transcript levels were consistently higher or lower in the ds <dig> strain, irrespective of the presence of paa . groups  <dig> and  <dig> represent genes that show a higher and a lower transcript level in the presence of paa, but only in the ds <dig> strain. these latter profiles are consistent with genes whose transcription is responsive to the production of penicilling.

gene expression responses to removal of the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster
a total number of  <dig> genes  showed significantly different transcript levels in cultures of the high-producing and cluster-free strains, irrespective of the presence of the side-chain precursor paa. as expected, transcripts of the three biosynthesis genes, pcbab, pcbc and pende could not be detected in the cluster-free strain. as a result of the strain construction the other genes in the amplified region  are present as a single copy in the ds <dig> strain. the observation that several of these genes showed reduced expression levels in the ds <dig> strain would therefore be consistent with a gene-dosage effect . in addition, as confirmed by studies on a different industrial strain of p. chrysogenum  <cit>  and on the laboratory strain wisconsin54- <dig>  <cit> , not all genes in the amplified region are transcriptionally induced under penicilling producing conditions. in addition to an enrichment of functional categories related to β-lactam biosynthesis , group  <dig>  was also enriched for functional categories  <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig>  which are related to nitrogen and sulfur metabolism . upregulation of the synthesis of  amino acids may be indicative for an increased synthesis of the amino-acid β-lactam precursors. the observation that higher transcript levels of these genes were also observed in the ds <dig> strain when it was grown in the absence of the side-chain precursor paa may indicate that even the low net production of β-lactam intermediates under these conditions has an impact on mrna level regulation of precursor biosynthesis.

among the  <dig> genes that were transcribed at higher levels in the penicillin-biosynthesis gene cluster-free strain than in the ds <dig> strain   <dig> genes were physically linked in the same chromosomal region . although the increased transcript level of these genes was also observed in the presence of paa, it was most pronounced in its absence. annotation of many of these genes and their clustering suggests a role in secondary metabolite production   <cit> . among those  <dig> genes, the paralog of the aristolochene synthase gene, ari <dig>  from penicillium roqueforti  <cit> , which shares 97% identity, was identified . synthesis of aristolochene represents the first step in the synthesis of sesquiterpenoids, which include potent anticancer compounds  <cit> . in penicillium roqueforti, aristolochene is a precursor of pr toxin  <cit> , for which the further biosynthesis pathway remains unidentified.

gene expression responses to the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid 
 <dig> genes  showed a consistently different transcript level in the presence and absence of paa. remarkably, genes belonging to the penicillin biosynthesis gene cluster were not differentially expressed in the presence and absence of paa, with the pcb genes still being highly expressed in the absence of paa. only the gene encoding the paa coa ligase   <cit>  showed a significantly higher transcript level in the presence of paa . recent functional characterization of phl revealed that upon its deletion, the paa-coa ligase activity decreased by only 40%  <cit> , indicating the existence of one or more additional paa-coa ligases. five genes with similarity to aryl- or fatty-acid coa ligases were expressed to a higher level in cultures of both strains grown in the presence of paa. the two closest phl homologues  showed over 65% identity with aspergillus proteins of unknown function, as well as a strong similarity with arabidopsis thaliana 4-coumarate-coa ligase  . further inspection of the predicted amino acid sequences of both these genes identified the presence of pts <dig> peroxisomal targeting sequences. based on these observations, pc22g <dig> and pc22g <dig> represent interesting candidates for further functional analysis aimed at identifying alternative paa coa-ligases in phlΔ strains.

both strains showed penicilling independent metabolism of paa. in the ds <dig> strain, this was evident from the observation that paa consumption exceeded penicilling production . indeed, the paa hydroxylase gene   <cit>  that encodes the first step of the paa catabolism through the homogentisate pathway was highly induced in cultures grown in the presence of paa . however, it has been reported, already early in the strain improvement lineage that a mutation  in this gene results in a dramatic reduction of enzyme activity  <cit> . interestingly, a second gene , whose predicted protein sequence shared 42% identity with the paha product also showed strongly elevated transcript levels  in the presence of paa. this second gene is 82% identical to aspergillus nidulans phacb  <cit> , which encodes a 3-hydroxyphenylacetate 6-hydroxylase and  <dig> -dihydroxyphenylacetate 6-hydroxylase cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase capable of converting paa into 2-hydroxyphenylacetate. this second gene may well be responsible for residual paa catabolism in industrial strains that carry a loss-of-function mutation in paha. based on genome annotation and the transcript profiles of cultures grown in the presence and absence of paa, the entire homogentisate pathway, which ultimately leads to the formation of fumarate and acetoacetate, could be mapped. genes encoding a homogentisate dioxygenase ; a maleylacetoacetate isomerase  and a fumarylacetoacetase  were tentatively identified, completing the identification of the metabolic pathway. in contrast to the other paa-utilizing pathway  the five genes of the homogentisate pathway all showed a strong gene level upregulation in presence of paa . apparently, despite the reduction of the pathway's activity, transcriptional regulation of the homogentisate pathway is still functional in high-producing strains of p. chrysogenum. as indicated by their gene identity codes, the orfs pc12g <dig>  pc12g <dig> and pc12g <dig> form a chromosomal cluster. a similar clustering of the homogentisate pathways genes has been observed in aspergillus nidulans  <cit> . an additional gene of this cluster, pc12g <dig>  that shares 51% of identity with a. nidulans an <dig>  and displays similarity with a putative transcription factor from neosartorya fischeri, was also upregulated in presence of paa in both ds <dig> and ds <dig> . this observation makes it tempting to speculate that pc12g <dig> participates in transcriptional regulation of paa catabolism . the characterisation of the genes encoding the pathway ; a maleylacetoacetate isomerase  and a fumarylacetoacetase ), the physical clustering of these genes and the presence of a co-clustered putative transcription factor represent interesting targets for metabolic engineering to eliminate residual rates of paa consumption and to alleviate a potential protein burden  <cit>  imposed by high-level induction of this pathway.

transport mechanisms for β-lactam antibiotics and side-chain precursors, both across the fungal plasma membrane and between intracellular compartments, remain incompletely understood. the functional category analysis of genes that showed an increased transcript level in cultures grown in the presence of paa showed a clear enrichment of the transport-related functions .  <dig> genes in the functional categories 'cellular transport and transport mechanisms' and 'transport facilitation' showed a significantly increased transcript level in cultures grown with paa in both strains . the uptake of undissociated phenylacetic acid in p. chrysogenum has been reported to occur via passive diffusion  <cit> . however, by analogy to the well-studied non-filamentous yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which paa is exported by the atp-binding cassette transporter pdr <dig>  <cit> , its anion form is likely to be actively exported into the medium as a detoxification mechanism. from the available functional annotation of the penicillium genome,  <dig> out the  <dig> genes  display motif signatures of abc transporters, as well as sequence similarity to the aspergillus nidulans atrb  <cit>  and atrd  <cit>  proteins, respectively. only pc22g <dig> belongs to the abc-g transporters cluster  <cit>  that also includes pdr <dig>  which makes pc22g <dig> a very attractive candidate for further characterization.

activation of paa and the final biosynthetic step in the penicilling biosynthesis pathway, the exchange of the aminoadipic acid side-chain for paa, both occur in the peroxisome. this metabolic compartmentation of penicilling production makes transport of isopenicillinn, paa and penicilling across the peroxisomal membrane an integral and important part of penicilling biosynthesis. only one of the transporter genes that showed an increased transcript level in cultures grown with paa  showed a clear link with peroxisomes. this gene shows strong similarity to the saccharomyces cerevisiae ant <dig> gene that encodes a peroxisome-localised protein involved in adenine nucleotide transport, medium-chain fatty acid metabolism, and peroxisome proliferation  <cit> .

the genes that showed a consistently lower transcript level in cultures grown in the presence of paa ), failed to show a clear enrichment of any functional category and, moreover, showed a high incidence of genes with unknown function and/or similarity with a gene of unknown function in another organism.

dissection of gene expression responses to paa and to penicilling production
for future studies into the mechanism, compartmentation and regulation of penicilling biosynthesis, it would be helpful to dissect transcriptional responses of side-chain precursor availability and penicilling biosynthesis itself. the cluster-free strain described above synthesizes neither penicilling nor any of its intermediates, even when grown in presence of paa. consequently, genes that show a transcriptional response to paa that is specific for the high-producing strain ds <dig> are likely to be related to penicilling production rather than to the presence of paa per se .

this approach yielded  <dig> genes  whose transcript level was specifically higher in penicilling producing cultures of the ds <dig> strains and  <dig> genes  that showed a lower transcript level in these conditions. group  <dig> was enriched for genes whose annotation involved functions in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, secondary metabolism and transport. among the  <dig> genes assigned to the nitrogen and sulfur metabolism funcat annotation, six were sharing significant homology with dioxygenases -dependent sulfonate alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, figure 7). although these enzymes participate in the mobilisation of sulfur from alternative sources , the analogy with the low-sulfate response as recorded in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  cannot be extended further. for example, consistent with the excess sulfate included in the growth media, we did not observe a transcriptional upregulation of key enzymes in sulfate assimilation . however, the transcript level of the sulfate transporter gene sutb  <cit>  was specifically increased by  <dig> % in the penicilling producing cultures of the ds <dig> strain. moreover, the sutb transcript level was + <dig> -fold higher in the ds <dig> strain than in the ds <dig> strain when grown in the presence of paa. a similar transcript profile was observed for pc18g <dig>  which has a strong similarity with high-affinity methionine permease genes. the second p. chrysogenum sulfate transporter gene suta  <cit>  was transcribed at very low levels under all conditions tested. specific transcript level increase of several genes involved in sulfur and nitrogen assimilation in penicilling producing scenarios suggests that a drain of amino acid precursors  may affect intracellular pools of these amino acids. indeed, metabolic flux analysis of p. chrysogenum grown under producing and non-producing conditions showed that the flux from 3-phosphoglycerate to serine and cysteine biosynthesis was 6-fold higher under penicilling-producing conditions  <cit> . one gene involved in serine and cysteine synthesis  showed an increased transcript level in penicilling producing cultures of the ds <dig> strain. this identifies the analysis, and possibly engineering, of cysteine and valine biosynthesis as relevant activities in applied research on β-lactam production.

the transporter for penicilling in p. chrysogenum is still unknown. although it cannot be excluded that the penicillin transporter is among the  <dig> constitutively transcribed transporters, the  <dig> transporters in group  <dig> form an interesting group for initial analysis. out of the  <dig> transporter-encoding genes found in group  <dig>   <dig> were assigned to transport of a wide range of nitrogen sources, including urea , allantoate , various amino acids including lysine and methionine  and oligopeptides . whereas lysine and methionine transport might be related to the sulfur status of the cells  the role of the other genes is more elusive. however, two observations on transport-related genes provide interesting leads for follow-up studies. firstly, pc22g <dig>  whose transcript profile correlated perfectly with the production of penicillin g, shows strong similarity with the a. niger gene an15g <dig>  which encodes an oligopeptide transporter. interestingly transport of β-lactams through human intestinal epithelium involves an oligopeptide  transporter  <cit> . we are currently investigating the possibility that this transporter is involved in penicilling export.

the second example a priori has no relationship with the penicillin synthesis; a group of  <dig> genes, whose products all show similarities with the yeast allantoate transporter dal <dig>  exhibited a significant upregulation under penicilling producing conditions. these genes belong to a larger genome-wide family of  <dig> members. although these  <dig> transporters share the same description "strong similarity to dal5", they display very different expression profiles. without functional analysis studies on these genes, any biological interpretation of this observation would remain speculative.

along with the penicilling synthesis,  <dig> genes that could be involved in secondary metabolism were also expressed to a higher level under penicilling producing conditions. this group harboured two genes pc21g <dig> and pc21g <dig> that exhibit strong similarities with a feruoyl-coa synthetase from a niger and a 4-coumarate-coa ligase from arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. while the transcript levels of these genes, remained lower than those of the two paa-inducible putative aryl-coa ligases mentioned above, this does not rule out a possible contribution of their gene products to in vivo paa activation, which is further supported by the putative peroxisomal targeting signal that both harbour.

analysis of upstream regulatory sequences
the  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the atg of groups of genes that showed a similar transcriptional regulation were analysed for cis-regulatory elements. meme analysis identified two motifs in group  <dig> and  <dig> motif in group  <dig> that met the statistical criteria applied . although these motifs had a good coverage of the genes in the group, the most strongly regulated genes, those involved in paa catabolism, did not contain this motif in their  <dig> nucleotide upstream region. in addition, some of the motifs identified are shared by the different co-regulated groups and none match any of the known binding sites of the limited set of described transcription factors . possibly the long history of strain improvement of these strains has resulted in a loss of conserved motifs. nevertheless, a similar analysis performed on a set of  <dig> co-regulated genes responding to paa in the lab strain wis54- <dig> and the ds <dig> strain  identified the same motifs as found in the present study . increasing the length of the motif to be identified resulted in the same core conserved nucleotides . in addition, as the groups of co-regulated genes are quite large, the discriminating power of meme may not be sufficient to identify the actual conserved and regulating motifs. testing a small subset of the genes, the  <dig> genes known to be directly involved in paa catabolism, indeed resulted in different motifs that had a very high coverage over the genes tested. however, none of these motifs passed the stringent statistical criteria applied. these preliminary results suggest that motif identification in filamentous fungi may require different approaches than hitherto applied in more intensively studied microorganisms.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> years after fleming's discovery of the antibacterial activity of penicillin, research on penicillium chrysogenum has now become accessible to genomics approaches  <cit> . in the present study, we have integrated microarray-based transcriptome analysis with chemostat cultivation. this approach, which has already shown to be fruitful in other organisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , trichoderma reesei  <cit>  and escherichia coli  <cit> , enables an investigation of the effect of individual culture parameters on genome-wide gene expression regulation. reproducibility of transcript data is often cited as an additional advantage of chemostat-based microarray analysis  <cit> . although steady-state chemostat cultivation of filamentous fungi is experimentally more challenging than chemostat cultivation of non-filamentous microorganisms, the excellent reproducibility of the transcript data obtained with p. chrysogenum indicates that this does not preclude accurate and reproducible chemostat-based transcriptome analysis.

in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures of s. cerevisiae, ca.  <dig> % of its  <dig> genes  <cit>  showed a detectable transcript level. of the much larger genome of p. chrysogenum, cultivation under similar conditions yielded a detectable transcript for only  <dig> % of the genes. furthermore, of the  <dig> genes that showed a differential transcript level under at least one of the conditions, 53% has an unknown function. this percentage is similar to the percentage of unclassified proteins throughout the whole genome sequence  <cit> . these observations illustrate the formidable challenges that remain to be addressed in the functional analysis of the genomes of filamentous fungi. the identification of gene function in p. chrysogenum is likely to benefit tremendously from the rapid sequencing, annotation and analysis of the genomes of other filamentous fungi, such as those of n. crassa  <cit> , a. fumigatus  <cit> , a. nidulans  <cit> , a. oryzae  <cit> , a. niger  <cit> , t. reesei  <cit> . for example, the recent characterisation of a new sulfate transporter gene, asta, in a. nidulans, homologous to the s. cerevisiae dal <dig> transporter  <cit>  enabled us to tentatively interpret the involvement of a similar gene in p. chrysogenum as being part of a broader sulfur-related response.

carefully designed transcriptomics experiments can help to prioritize targets for functional analysis based on at least three criteria:  the absence of a detectable transcript level rules out that the gene product contributes to either fitness or industrial performance under the experimental conditions,  gene expression regulation can provide insight into the possible role of gene products in an experimental context, although relations between transcript profiles and contribution to fitness are not necessarily straightforward  <cit> , and  the availability of possible sequence-derived information on the putative catalytic, structural or regulatory role of gene products that suggest a role in fitness and/or industrial performance  <cit> . based on these criteria, several priority targets for future functional analysis studies have been identified in the present study .

the present study demonstrates how a simple combinatorial design of chemostat experiments, involving two p. chrysogenum strains, can be applied to dissect effects of side-chain-precursor availability and β-lactam production. while similar approaches have previously been applied to dissect effects of oxygen availability and nutrient limitation in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , this is to our knowledge the first application of such an approach to a product-forming system. our experimental design required a strain of p. chrysogenum that lacked a functional penicillin gene cluster. a cluster-free strain previously described  <cit> , was derived from the low-producing wisconsin54- <dig> strain. as we sought to maximize the difference between producing and non-producing scenarios, a new cluster-free strain  was derived from a penicilling-high-producing strain background . the approach presented in this paper should be applicable to the production of other secondary metabolites in systems where production can be controlled by the addition of a precursor molecule. in p. chrysogenum, this might for example include the production, by engineered strains, of the cephalosporin precursors 7-amino-deacetoxycephalosporanic acid   <cit> , adipoyl-7-amino-3-carbamoyloxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid   <cit>  and deacetylcephalosporin c  <cit> .
