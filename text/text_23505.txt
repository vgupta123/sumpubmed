BACKGROUND
toxoplasma gondii is a highly prevalent obligate intracellular protozoan parasite causing disease in immunocompromised individuals and congenitally infected infants. ten toxoplasma strains, representing predominant strains in europe, north and south america
 <cit>  and a type ii/iii recombinant strain
 <cit>  have been sequenced, with the me <dig>  a type ii strain, genome used as a reference. the toxoplasma genome, which is publicly available in the toxoplasma database , is approximately 65mb, made up of  <dig> chromosomes, and  <dig> genes, with an average of  <dig>  introns per gene and a 52% g / c content
 <cit> .

while computational tools such as glimmerhhm and tigrscan
 <cit> , and twinscan
 <cit>  have been useful resources for toxoplasma gene model predictions, differences in the algorithms used by these programs have often resulted in different gene models, leading to uncertainties in the current gene models
 <cit> . accurately annotated gene models are imperative for genomic research on toxoplasma but sufficient genomic data, such as full-length complementary dna  sequences, is not available to refine the computationally predicted gene models. additionally, even though there are reports of alternative splicing of some toxoplasma genes
 <cit> , it is currently unknown what the extent of alternative splicing is in toxoplasma. transcript sequence data, such as expressed sequence tags , full-length cdnas , and cdna sequences, provide reliable evidence for resolving gene structures
 <cit>  because they define the intron-exon boundaries and are similar to the genomic sequence. fl-cdnas would be ideal for gene annotation, since they encode the full-length transcript with well demarcated exon-exon junctions, but the current cost of sanger sequencing makes this method very expensive. although there is an abundance of est and end-sequenced cdna data 
 <cit> , few fl-cdna sequence data is available for toxoplasma. rna sequencing 
 <cit>  which generates short cdna sequences , has become a powerful tool for gene expression studies and for the de novo assembly of transcriptomes
 <cit> . the short sequences generated by rna-seq, however, must first be assembled into full transcript structures using either of two strategies
 <cit> : 1) ‘mapping-first’ strategy
 <cit> , which involves first aligning the short reads to a reference genome followed by merging of sequences with overlapping alignments, and spanning splice junctions, or 2) ‘assembly-first’  strategy
 <cit> , which uses the reads to directly assemble transcripts that can then be mapped to a reference genome.

generally any approach used to reconstruct transcripts from rna-seq data must be able to navigate the complications imposed by: i) low expression of some genes that are in turn represented by low rna-seq data thus making them difficult to fully reconstruct, and ii) short read lengths and alternative splicing which often makes it hard to correctly match each isoform with a read
 <cit> . while the ‘mapping first’ approach is ideal for model organisms with complete genomes, it still requires correct alignment of the reads to the reference genome, a fact that is convoluted by alternative splicing and sequencing errors. furthermore, even in well annotated genomes, like the mouse and human genomes, there are still novel gene annotations being discovered
 <cit> , making it imprudent to completely rely on currently available gene structures. nevertheless, this approach promises maximal sensitivity and requires less computational resources compared to the assembly first approach. on the other hand since the ‘assembly first’ approach does not require a reference genome, it is well suited for reconstructing transcripts from organisms with incomplete or no annotated genomes. however, besides the large amount of computational infrastructure required, the key challenge to this approach is the partitioning of reads into components representing transcript isoforms. that is, as the number of reads increases, it becomes difficult to determine which reads should be joined into a contiguous contig. however, this problem has been resolved by the use of the de bruijn graph which models overlapping sequences rather than reads, thereby reducing the complexity of dealing with multiple reads
 <cit> . additionally, by analyzing the graph paths taken by the reads and read pairs and applying a coverage cutoff to determine which path to follow or to remove
 <cit> , the problem posed by sequencing errors from variations, which can make the graph complex by introducing branching points are easily resolved
 <cit> . overall, both of these approaches have been reported to accurately reconstruct several transcripts and alternative isoforms
 <cit> , therefore, the choice of which method to use is invariably dependent on the availability of a well annotated reference genome and the biological question to be answered.

we sequenced cdna from polyadenylated rna obtained from murine bone marrow derived macrophages infected with a type ii toxoplasma strain . because currently there is no annotated genome for the pru strain, and the me <dig> reference genome is not complete, we then used trinity-based de novo transcript assembly
 <cit>  to reconstruct transcripts from approximately  <dig> million rna-seq reads. finally, we used pasa 
 <cit> , and the published me <dig> reference genome 
 <cit> , to filter invalid assemblies and transcripts likely resulting from sequencing errors, and to reconstruct more complete transcripts. pasa assembles overlapping and compatible alignments, which are defined as overlapping alignments transcribed on the same strand and have identical introns in the regions of their overlap
 <cit> , and is therefore suitable for the discovery of alternative splicing variants and novel transcripts. transcripts derived from de novo assembly and alignments to a reference genome are reported to provide a template for genome annotation that compares well with the utility of fl-cdnas
 <cit> . using this hybrid approach , we provide transcript-based gene structures that we then use to confirm toxodb gene models, update existing utrs, update current toxodb predicted intron/exon boundaries, identify new gene models that represent alternatively spliced isoforms, and identify new genes. in summary, we have identified  <dig>  transcripts not overlapping with any known me <dig> genes; some of which may be novel genes, or non-coding rnas. additionally, we have identified  <dig> alternatively spliced transcripts and report on their differential usage amongst  <dig> clonal toxoplasma strains.

RESULTS
de novo full-length transcript assembly
approximately  <dig>  billion  <dig> base-pair  paired-end rna-seq reads generated from murine bone-marrow derived macrophages infected with toxoplasma were used to assemble toxoplasma full-length transcripts in trinity
 <cit>  and pasa
 <cit> . a flow chart of the steps followed to assemble and annotate transcripts is presented in figure
 <dig>  because the parasites used to infect the murine macrophages were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts , we initially used the genome alignment tool, tophat
 <cit>  to sequentially align the rna-seq reads to the mouse  and human  reference genomes and a collection of mouse and human splice junctions
 <cit> , to filter out mouse and human reads. since the two genomes  are almost complete, about  <dig> million reads, which did not align to them, were considered to be mainly toxoplasma derived and were used as input for de novo transcript assembly in trinity . in total, we assembled  <dig>  contigs .

the transcript assembly strategy employed in trinity  requires trinity contigs to be joined only if there is a substantial overlap between them. therefore, reads obtained from an alternatively spliced gene will be assembled into one complete transcript and one contig representing the unique region from the second isoform. additionally, lowly expressed genes may not generate enough rna-seq reads for complete transcript assembly, particularly for longer genes. consequently, the trinity contigs will be a mixture of complete transcripts , unique regions of alternatively spliced transcripts, and fragments from lowly expressed genes. thus, to filter trinity contigs and identify alternatively spliced transcripts, we used pasa to assemble and cluster them based on the positions they aligned to in the type ii  toxoplasma genome. following assembly in pasa,  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  trinity contigs  had valid me <dig> genome alignments and were clustered into  <dig>  transcripts , while  <dig>  had invalid alignments and were excluded from pasa analysis .

a major limitation to both de novo and ab initio transcriptome assembly is that overlapping transcripts can be joined even though they are not from polycistronic rna . for overlapping transcripts transcribed on opposite strands, this problem can be mitigated by the use of strand specific rna-sequencing
 <cit> . however, overlapping transcripts transcribed from the same strand can only be separated by using cap- or end-specific rna-seq
 <cit> . however, amongst the requirements for valid transcript alignment to the genome in pasa is that all inferred exon-intron boundaries must have consensus splice sites, a requirement that is unlikely to be met when overlapping utrs from two adjacent genes translated on opposite strands are joined in trinity to form a spurious intron. furthermore, during transcript annotation update in pasa, some fused transcripts will be rejected if considered to result in transcripts that are out of frame with the existing gene structures. additionally, transcripts can only have valid alignments in pasa if 90% of their length has 95% sequence similarity with the me <dig> genome. consequently, we postulated that some of the  <dig>  trinity contigs that did not have valid alignments to the me <dig> genome in pasa contain toxoplasma transcripts that were erroneously joined in trinity due to overlapping utrs and transcripts that did not meet the 90% length requirement. indeed when these  <dig>  trinity contigs were aligned to me <dig> proteins using blastx
 <cit> ,  <dig> matched known me <dig> proteins. we envisioned two possible scenarios for overlapping genes joined by chance in trintiy: a) if two fully assembled transcripts are joined due to overlapping utrs the resulting transcript will produce  <dig> orfs, each significantly matching either one of the two overlapping genes, and b) if only one transcript of the joined pair is completely assembled then it will align to the protein sequence of only one of the genes. of the  <dig> trinity contigs having significant matches against me <dig> genes in blastx,  <dig> significantly matched at least  <dig> adjacent me <dig> genes . an example is the trinity contig comp489_c0_seq <dig>  which significantly matched three adjacent genes; rop <dig> , tgme49_ <dig>  and tgme49_ <dig>  but produced only  <dig> orfs one matching rop <dig> and the other matching tgme49_ <dig> and tgme49_ <dig>  thus, tgme49_ <dig> and tgme49_ <dig> seem to be a single gene but the 3’utr of tgme49_ <dig> gene was erroneously joined with the 5’ utr of rop <dig>  indeed splice junction tracks, supported by rna-seq data, available in toxodb confirm the existence of a splice site between the last exon of tgme49_ <dig> and the first exon of tgme49_ <dig> . we conclude that these  <dig> transcripts were erroneously joined in trinity due to an overlap in their utrs and were therefore, rejected by pasa. the rest of the  <dig> trinity contigs that aligned to me <dig> proteins are toxoplasma transcripts that were discarded in pasa because they did not meet the 90% alignment length requirement imposed in pasa. the other  <dig>  trinity contigs that did not match me <dig> genes produced significant matches against mouse and human bacterial artificial clone  sequences available in the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database, and none mapped to known mouse or human genes.

we hypothesized that the limiting factor for full-length transcript assembly is the rna-seq coverage of each gene. to test this, we calculated the number of rna-seq reads overlapping each full-length pasa transcript  then binned the pasa transcripts based on rna-read coverage. because there is a high probability of sequencing cdnas from long compared to short transcripts, reads from longer transcripts tend to be over-represented in the sequencing data. we correct for this bias by presenting coverage as a fraction of transcript length, reads per kilobase . we have also provided the raw read coverage for each pasa transcript . as expected, we found that the ability to assemble complete transcripts was improved with high read coverage of each gene .

identification of novel toxoplasma genes
since the toxoplasma genome annotation is incomplete, we postulated that some of the pasa transcripts were putative novel me <dig> and toxoplasma genes . because the pasa transcripts are annotated based on the region they aligned to in the me <dig> genome, we searched for pasa transcripts whose genomic coordinates overlapped with known me <dig> genes in toxodb  using bedtools
 <cit> . we confirmed some of these intersections by simultaneous viewing of individual pasa transcripts and toxodb genes in the integrative genomics viewer 
 <cit> . we identified a total  <dig>  pasa transcripts with, and  <dig>  pasa transcripts without genomic coordinate overlap with known toxodb genes . approximately, 93% of the  <dig>  transcripts were predicted to be from single exon genes, and  <dig>  aligned to sequences on the toxodb ds984xxx-designated scaffolds, corresponding to scaffolds yet to be assigned to the  <dig> toxoplasma chromosomes. because the  <dig>  transcripts align to the me <dig> genome but do not overlap any known me <dig> gene, and have substantial raw rna-seq reads pile-up , they are potentially transcribed from novel genes.

to investigate if any of these pasa transcripts were indeed novel protein coding transcripts, we performed a blastx search against the non-redundant protein database in ncbi , with an expectation cutoff of 10- <dig>   <dig> of these transcripts matched known me <dig> proteins and were excluded from potential novel genes. we postulate that these  <dig> transcripts may be novel genes but produce orfs that are partially identical to other known me <dig> proteins.  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> transcripts had significant matches against other proteins in the non-redundant ncbi database. interestingly, the majority of the transcripts,  <dig>  significantly matched sequences from either neospora caninum, a close relative of toxoplasma, or from other toxoplasma strains.  <dig> transcripts out of the  <dig> were of the same length and had identical sequences to proteins already described in other toxoplasma strains  indicating that these are genes yet to be annotated in the me <dig> strain ; the strain to which we aligned the pasa transcripts . while another  <dig> transcripts significantly matched toxoplasma proteins of the same length in the ncbi database, the percentage of sequence similarity ranged from 91-99%. potentially, these  <dig> are novel me <dig> genes, but unlike the first  <dig>  are polymorphic between me <dig> and the other toxoplasma strains. an example of this is a  <dig> amino acid long protein, which produced two significant hits against gt <dig>  and veg  proteins with three mismatches; two mismatches occurring at positions where the gt <dig> and veg proteins showed polymorphism, and the other mismatch was at a position where the gt <dig> and veg proteins were homologous. the other proteins that aligned to neospora proteins may be proteins yet to be described in any of the toxoplasma strain i.e. novel toxoplasma genes.

the remaining  <dig>  pasa transcripts that produced no significant blastx match are unlikely to encode proteins and are potential non-coding rnas or spurious transcript assemblies. however, some of these transcripts could be fragments from novel genes and therefore not all of them can be regarded as non-coding rnas. nevertheless, about 80% of pasa transcripts with rpk values above  <dig> were fully assembled . we therefore, investigated the likelihood of the  <dig>  pasa transcripts being pieces of incompletely assembled novel genes based on their rpk values. of the  <dig>  pasa transcripts,  <dig>  had rpk values above  <dig> and a minimum length of 200bp . even though majority of the  <dig> transcripts have single exons, based on the rpk values, these  <dig> transcripts are likely to be fully assembled. because lincrnas are often expressed at low levels compared to protein-coding genes
 <cit> , deeper sequencing might clarify if the other transcripts are fragments of new genes or are putative lincrnas.

toxoplasma gondii gene model annotation
following the identification of transcripts overlapping known me <dig> genes, we compared our predicted pasa gene models and the current toxodb gene models. even though each pasa transcript overlapping with a me <dig> gene is likely transcribed from that gene, some of these pasa transcripts could be fragments sequenced from retained introns, misassemblies, antisense transcripts, misalignments, or non-coding rnas transcribed from within known genes. consequently, to identify which of the  <dig>  pasa transcripts overlapping with known me <dig> genes were protein-coding, we performed a blastx search against known me <dig> proteins, with an expectation cutoff of 10-10;  <dig>  non-redundant pasa transcripts produced significant matches, with  <dig>  transcripts producing orfs of identical length and sequence to the protein from the me <dig> gene they overlapped. the remaining  <dig>  did not produce any significant match and were excluded from further analysis. it is plausible that the pasa transcripts with no significant match are fragments from larger genes not fully reconstructed due to insufficient rna-seq read coverage. however, about  <dig> of these transcripts had rpk values > <dig>  the level at which about 80% of the transcripts were fully assembled . consequently, we propose that some of these transcripts are putative non-coding rnas transcribed from within known toxoplasma genes, are antisense rna , are translated on different frames from those used in predicting toxodb proteins, or that some of the currently predicted toxodb genes overlapped by these pasa transcripts are spurious.

when we compared pasa and toxobd gene models, we found inconsistencies which we classified as follows:

a) variations in toxodb utrs annotation: inaccuracies in the utrs of annotated toxodb genes has previously been reported
 <cit> . this set constituted the majority of variation evidenced between our predicted models and those available in toxodb. since computational models, which is the basis for most of the toxodb gene models, are based on the prediction of coding sequences  while transcript-based models rely on the whole rna, variations in utrs between computational and rna-seq predicted gene models are expected to dominate. this set will produce orfs with identical sequence and length to the proteins of toxodb transcripts they overlapped, but will have different gene coordinates due to differences in utr lengths .

b) fused genes: this category includes transcripts predicted in pasa to be single genes but are reported in toxodb to be more than one individual gene. as indicated above, genes transcribed from the same or opposite strands that were spuriously joined due to overlapping utrs did not pass the pasa filter. consequently, the transcripts included in this set are those that had splice sites at the inferred exon-intron junctions, had rna-seq reads supporting the splice junctions, and were in frame with the annotated toxodb genes that were predicted to be fused. about  <dig> transcripts were included in this category .

c) toxodb genes predicted in pasa to have either different transcription start sites or novel 5’ exons: this group includes transcripts which even though they have orfs that are identical in sequence to the protein of the toxodb gene they overlap, the orfs differ in length from the toxodb protein. amongst these were transcripts with extra 5’ exons not predicted in the toxodb gene they overlapped, and transcripts with the same exon counts to the toxodb gene but different 5’ start sites .

d) inaccuracies on the 3’ end sites of toxodb genes. these included toxodb genes predicted in pasa to have extra 3’ exons or different 3’ end sites . like c above, these transcripts produced orfs that were identical to the proteins of the toxodb genes they overlapped but were of variable length either due to a novel 3’ exon or different 3’ end site.

e) novel exons within predicted toxodb genes: we found transcripts with at least one novel exon in regions annotated for introns within protein-coding toxodb genes .

f) of the changed toxodb genes, we found genes with fewer or spurious exons compared to the pasa transcripts .

it is worth noting that there are overlaps in the identities of toxodb genes grouped into these categories and that unlike inaccuracies in the utrs, variations in the 5’ start and 3’ end sites result in proteins of different lengths to those predicted in pasa. additionally, due to the possibility of some of the pasa transcripts being incomplete assemblies, we did not investigate longer toxodb genes that are potentially several genes fused together .

assessing alternative splicing in toxoplasma gondii
to determine the extent of alternative splicing in toxoplasma, we used the protein-encoding pasa transcripts overlapping  and not overlapping  with known me <dig> genes. transcripts were considered to be splice variants if they aligned to the same genomic locus, and were transcribed from the same stand. because variants supported by a single rna-seq read can be due to sequencing errors, reads from pre-processed rna, and errors in transcription, we computed the number of reads supporting the regions unique to each isoform i.e. reads supporting the existence of an alternative isoform; all the remaining variants were supported by at least two unique reads. in total  <dig> genes were alternatively spliced, resulting in  <dig> transcripts. however, only  <dig> alternatively spliced genes resulted in different transcript and protein isoforms . we did not observe any unique splicing patterns in the current study with splicing in toxoplasma generally taking the forms previously described in other eukaryotes
 <cit>  and included 1) alternate acceptor , 2) alternate donor , 3) alternate terminal exon , 4) retained intron , 5) spliced intron , 6) skipped exon , 7) retained exon , and 8) initiation within intron , where re and se, and ri and si are reciprocals. the description of each class is contained in campbell et al. <cit>  and an example of each is presented in figure
 <dig>  in our data, the majority of the alternative events  belonged to the ad class. additionally, because the isoform annotation is based on pooling of reads from  <dig> samples, the distribution of this splice isoforms amongst the individual samples is not apparent in the current study.

the limitation of our method for alternative isoform discovery is that junction read coverage of some genes may be insufficient to detect all mrna isoforms. therefore to determine the effect of gene expression level on the sensitivity of our alternative isoform detection method, we assessed whether the genes with the highest read coverage exhibited a frequency of alternative splicing different from that of genes with lower coverage. briefly, we first identified all single-exon protein-encoding pasa transcripts;  <dig>  were confirmed as single exon genes and did not have any alternative isoforms and were not considered further. the remaining  <dig>  set of non-redundant multi-exonic genes was binned based on read coverage. we then determined the fraction of alternatively spliced genes in each bin . we found that the ability to detect alternatively spliced genes was dependent on expression level, with alternatively spliced genes significantly enriched in the top bin . to differentiate major and minor isoforms, we compared their relative expression levels  and designated the most abundant as the major isoform. we expect that with transcriptomes from different host infection models, different toxoplasma growth stages  and strains, and with higher rna-seq read coverage, more alternatively spliced toxoplasma genes will be detected in the future.

differential isoform usage amongst different toxoplasma strains
differential isoform usage has previously been shown to be a determinant in disease progression in mice
 <cit> , humans
 <cit> , and parasite virulence
 <cit> . having detected alternatively spliced genes, we evaluated differential isoform usage amongst  <dig> clonal strains of toxoplasma prevalent in europe and north america  using the mixture-of-isoforms  algorithm
 <cit> . miso leverages the number of reads aligning to exons and exon junctions, taking into account the insert lengths for paired-end sequencing, to compute the percentage spliced in  value, which is the relative fraction of reads supporting the inclusion isoform
 <cit> . the percentage spliced in  values for select genes are presented in table
 <dig>  based on the psi values, there is evidence for alternative isoform usage by the toxoplasma strains.

however, because psi is based on the number of reads, which varies between samples, the psi value will be more informative for each sample and not between samples. to correct for the variations between samples when comparing alternative splicing, miso uses the bayes factor to calculate the odds of differential splicing occurring. we illustrate this by comparing splicing in pru and rh strains, two commonly used lab strains representing type ii and type i strains, respectively, and present a summary of genes, with at least  <dig> times  probability of being spliced in either strain, together with the corresponding values of reads supporting each isoform . as further evidence for the presence of the different transcript variants, we show a piling of rna-seq reads on a pair of isoforms in pru and rh . the alternatively spliced transcripts are from genes encoding a protein phosphatase, myosin light chain, rhoptry neck, a micronemal, a rna debranching enzyme, and rna-binding proteins, amongst others. because some of these genes are known to play some role in parasite invasion of cells, and alternative splicing leads to two protein isoforms, there is a potential for this variation to alter parasite virulence. for example, the one isoform of the micronemal protein is  <dig> amino acids long
 <cit>  while the alternative isoform has only  <dig> amino acids, which would possibly affect the biology of the parasite e.g. host cell invasion.

:x indicates x reads align to both isoforms but are not used in support of either isoform for a variety of reasons including reads aligning to exons far removed from the spliced site, :x, x reads support the second isoform but not the first, :x indicate x reads support the first isoform and not the second :x, x reads supporting both isoforms. missing values for rh indicate the absence of reads supporting the alternative isoform. the gene descriptions are shown in table
 <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in the current study, we have used approximately  <dig> million  <dig> bp paired-end rna-seq reads to reconstitute toxoplasma full-length transcripts de novo, evaluated the level of alternative splicing and accuracy of gene model prediction of toxodb genes. we have discovered a higher percentage of toxodb gene model inaccuracies, especially in utr and terminal exon regions, than previously reported
 <cit>  and report on alternative transcript isoforms as opposed to the single transcript per gene currently reported in toxodb. our results indicate that rna-seq is a robust and a relatively cheap method compared to full-length cdna sequencing that can be used to annotate toxoplasma genes and transcripts. however, as indicated by our results, this method requires high rna-seq read coverage. some of the alternatively spliced transcripts that we have identified are products of genes known to play some role in toxoplasma biology e.g. attachment to and entry into the host cell. however, the relevance of each of these alternative transcript isoforms in parasite virulence needs further investigation. based on our preliminary analysis, some of the transcripts identified are putative long intergenic non-coding rnas but further conclusive analysis is necessary. once the genome sequencing of the toxoplasma gondii strains currently underway is completed, a strategy similar to that employed for the identification of mouse and zebrafish lincrnas
 <cit> , may be employed to determine if some of these transcripts are lincrnas.
