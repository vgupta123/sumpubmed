BACKGROUND
the physiological function and physical integrity of epithelial tissues depends on contacts between cells that include adherens junctions and tight junctions . adherens junctions are cell-cell attachments of epithelial cells that are required for the subsequent construction of tight junctions and maintenance of cell polarization. adherens junctions are based on ca2+-dependent homotypic interactions of the extracellular domains of e-cadherin between neighboring cells. the cytosolic portion of the transmembrane e-cadherin is best known to bind to β-catenin, but as many as  <dig> proteins are reported to colocalize and/or associate with cadherin in adherens junctions in what has been called the “cadhesome”  <cit> .

e-cadherin mediated cell-cell junctions play an important role in contact inhibition of cell growth, and loss of e-cadherin expression occurs during tumor progression and metastasis  <cit> . this makes it important to understand the mechanisms that govern e-cadherin expression and distribution to the cell surface. wnt signaling plays a role in the distinctive switching of gene expression in epithelial cells. wnt activity is dramatically decreased after formation of cell-cell contacts  <cit> . the e-cadherin/catenin complex physically associates with the wnt co-receptor and is necessary for downstream β-catenin activation  <cit> .

phosphorylation is an established mechanism for regulating cadherin, and e-cadherin/catenin complexes are regulated by ser phosphorylation  <cit> . casein kinase  <dig>  and glycogen synthase kinase 3β  phosphorylate human e-cadherin at ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  which enhances the interaction with β-catenin  <cit> . on the other hand, ck <dig> phosphorylation of human ser <dig>  in the same region of e-cadherin disrupts cell-cell contacts with internalization of e-cadherin  <cit> . these phosphoser sites in e-cadherin constitute a recognition site for skp <dig>  leading to ubiquitination and degradation of e-cadherin, with an increase in cell migration and tumorigenesis  <cit> . the protein ser/thr phosphatases that regulate e-cadherin by countering ck <dig> and ck <dig> phosphorylation are unknown.

here, we discovered protein phosphatase- <dig> , which is highly expressed in epithelial cells, localizes to adherens junctions and associates with e-cadherin/catenin complexes in human epithelial cells. levels of pp6c mrna and protein are significantly increased in confluent cells and inducible rnai to deplete pp6c in confluent monolayers results in internalization of e-cadherin. the effects of pp6c knockdown are prevented by chemical inhibition of ck <dig> or by mutation of ser <dig> in mouse e-cadherin to a non-phosphorylated ala, showing pp6c requires this site in e-cadherin to regulate localization in adherens junctions. our results show pp <dig> is a key regulator of e-cadherin and suggests feedback up-regulation of pp <dig> to support e-cadherin localization.

RESULTS
protein phosphatase- <dig> in human epithelial cells
protein phosphatase- <dig> catalytic subunit  expression is highest in the gastrointestinal tract and in hematopoietic cells, based on tissue analyses of mrna and protein in geneatlas  and proteinatlas . we stained sections of normal human colon with hematoxylin and eosin  and for pp6c by immunohistochemistry . there was intense pp6c staining in the epithelial cells, seen as a continuous layer of cells surrounding the large unstained granules of mucosal fluid . staining for pp6c in the surrounding mesenchymal cells  was much weaker. a few scattered cells that stained intensely for pp6c we suspect were infiltrating lymphocytes. to study pp <dig> in human epithelial cells we chose caco- <dig> cells, which have been well characterized over the years as a model for the intestinal epithelium  <cit> .

caco- <dig> cells were seeded so as to reach confluence within days of culture and cells were fixed and stained for pp6c at various times. laser-scanning confocal microscopy showed immunofluorescent localization of the endogenous pp6c initially in the perinuclear region, and subsequently as predominantly cytosolic, with little or no staining in the nuclei . these observations are consistent with previous reports of pp6c being predominantly cytosolic  <cit> . the first days after replating pp6c immunostaining of individual cells appeared at either high or low intensities. areas with higher density cells, where nuclei were closer together  showed higher intensity pp6c compared to areas with lower density cells . when cultures became confluent  the pp6c was distributed uniformly throughout the cells, and we noted the staining intensity was higher than on previous days.

the increase in pp6c was confirmed by quantitative immunoblotting of cells harvested at various times after re-plating . the results demonstrated that relative levels of pp6c protein dramatically increased  between  <dig> and  <dig> days, when cells reached 100% confluence, and these higher levels more than doubled again over the next two weeks . by comparison levels of the pp6-specific regulatory subunits pp6r <dig> and pp6r <dig>  the dominant endogenous partners for pp6c, did not increase over the first two weeks and showed only slightly increased levels after  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of culture , indicating their expression was not co-dependent with pp6c. there was a step-wise increase in the amount of pp6r <dig>  at  <dig> days after the cells had reached confluence and this level persisted for  <dig> days . thus, the pattern of pp6c expression was different from any of its regulatory subunits. actin was used as a loading control to insure the same amount of total cell protein was analyzed on the immunoblots . these observations support the hypothesis that the pp6c was accumulating in cells without a corresponding increase in one of its canonical saps partners.

the multi-fold increase in pp6c protein levels was unexpected and unusual for a ser/thr phosphatase. by comparison, there was no detectable change over the entire time course, up to  <dig> days, in the levels of the closely related phosphatase pp2a catalytic subunit  or its specific scaffolding subunit  . this shows the cell density changes in expression levels were not common among ppp phosphatases. previous studies have shown that pp2a is under stringent feedback control, keeping the protein levels within a relatively narrow range  <cit> . levels of α <dig>  the atypical subunit that binds to all type 2a phosphatases  also did not change when caco- <dig> cells formed confluent monolayers. because neither α <dig> nor pp2a levels changed we concluded it was unlikely that α <dig> was involved in the increase in pp <dig> 

we also examined cell-density dependent increase of pp6c expression in human arpe- <dig> pigmented retinal epithelial cells. different number of cells  were seeded in  <dig> well plates and cultured for  <dig> days at which time they were at 40-50%, 80-90%, 90-100% confluent and 100% post-confluent, respectively. the pp6c content of arpe- <dig> cells increased with cell density and was much higher in near-confluent and post-confluent cells . these results showed different human epithelial cell lines exhibit cell density-dependent increase in expression of the catalytic subunit of pp <dig> 

enhanced pp6c expression in high-density epithelial cells
we examined what might contribute to the elevated pp6c protein levels in high density cells. the increase was due at least in part to elevation of the steady-state levels of pp6c mrna. we used quantitative real-time pcr to compare pp6c mrna in caco- <dig> cells plated at different densities and found that high density cells had significantly  more pp6c mrna compared to low density cells . levels of pp6c also can be controlled by at least two mirna, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and changes in these mirna and the levels of pp6c have been linked to different types of cancer  <cit> . our assays showed there was a significant increase in both mir <dig> and mir <dig> in high density vs. low density cells . these results run counter to expectations, because an increase in levels of mirna targeting pp6c would be predicted to reduce, not increase, protein production. we concluded that mir <dig> and mir <dig> are not the dominant factors controlling pp6c levels in caco- <dig> cells.

the increase in pp6c mrna levels in high density cells corresponded to increased transcription of the pp6c gene. we cloned the  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site and used this as a proximal promoter for expression of firefly luciferase. a dual luciferase system was used to assay for activity of the pp <dig> promoter. activity of firefly luciferase was normalized to renilla luciferase expressed from a separate plasmid that was co-transfected into cells. transcription driven by the pp6c promoter was nearly doubled in cells plated at high density vs. low density, a statistically significant difference . the relative increase in transcription corresponded to the increase in the mrna levels we observed, but do not seem to adequately account for the  <dig> to 20-fold increase in protein levels.

to test for a change in protein degradation we added cycloheximide to inhibit translation in high density caco- <dig> cells and observed that levels of both pp6c and pp2ac proteins were only slightly reduced after  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> days . in contrast, as a positive control, the levels of cyclin d <dig> in these cells were fully depleted within the first  <dig> hr . thus, there seemed to be a limited amount of pp6c degradation in high density cells. the low levels of pp6c protein made it difficult to observe degradation in low density cells. we concluded that an increase in transcription, elevated levels of mrna, and a low rate of protein degradation probably accounted for the accumulation of pp6c protein in high density epithelial cells.

association of pp6c with e-cadherin
in high density caco- <dig> cells we observed concentration of endogenous pp6c along the cell-cell boundaries by immunofluorescent confocal scanning microscopy . we used double immunostaining to examine whether pp <dig> was localized to adherens junctions or tight junctions in different optical sections. pp <dig> co-localized  in the same z plane section with e-cadherin , a marker of adherens junctions . on the other hand, pp <dig> did not overlap or co-localize with occludin , a tight junction protein . the results revealed specific localization of pp <dig> at adherens junctions.

the localization of pp6c at adherens junctions prompted us to test for association of pp6c with e-cadherin by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins in caco- <dig> cells. first, we separated cytosolic and membrane fractions by sucrose gradient centrifugation and analyzed protein distribution by immunoblotting . effective separation of membranes from cytosol was demonstrated by gapdh as a cytosolic marker and beta-integrin as a membrane marker. the majority of e-cadherin, β-catenin and α-catenin were recovered in the membrane fraction, as expected. conversely, phosphatases pp6c and pp2ac were predominantly in the cytosol, with limited amounts recovered in the membrane fraction . immunoprecipitation with anti-pp6c antibody compared to a non-specific igg as negative control demonstrated selective recovery of pp6c from either the cytosol or membrane fractions . from the membrane fraction, but not from the cytosol, there was specific co-precipitation of pp6c with e-cadherin, as well as α-catenin and β-catenin . furthermore, in a reciprocal immunoprecipitation, anti-e-cadherin antibody co-precipitated pp6c from the membrane fraction, compared to non-specific igg as a negative control to show specificity . none of the canonical pp <dig> subunits pp6r <dig>  r <dig> or r <dig> were detected in the immunoprecipitates . we concluded that endogenous pp <dig> forms stable complexes with e-cadherin/catenin in the adherens junctions of caco- <dig> epithelial cells. the regulatory subunits of pp <dig> were not detected by immunoblotting in the e-cadherin complexes prepared by immunoprecipitation from membranes. this supported the idea that pp6c associated with e-cadherin without participation of the saps subunits.

to test for direct protein-protein interaction between pp6c and e-cadherin, we used a pull-down assay with purified s-tagged pp6c on beads mixed with the cytosolic domain of e-cadherin . the s-tag pp6c was expressed in 293t cells, and recovered on s-protein beads that were washed with  <dig> m urea, which was sufficient to leave only the s-tag pp6c on the beads, based on silver staining after sds-page . the e-cadherin cytosolic domain was detected as a single 35s-radiolabeled protein produced by in vitro transcription and translation. using essentially identical amounts of 35s-e-cadherin cytosolic domain in the assays we observed some non-specific binding to control s-protein beads, but considerably more binding with s-tag pp6c on the beads . the results provide evidence for a direct protein-protein interaction between pp6c and the cytoplasmic tail of e-cadherin.

pp <dig> is required for maintenance of e-cadherin at adherens junctions
testing whether pp <dig> affects e-cadherin function or localization at adherens junctions poses experimental challenges. there are no pharmacological inhibitors specific for pp <dig> relative to other ppp phosphatases, and we found knockdown of pp6c in epithelial cells by sirna transfection prevented formation of confluent monolayers. as an alternative approach we generated lentiviruses using tripz vectors, with doxycycline  inducible expression of shrna targeting pp6c. inducible knockdown of pp6c in confluent caco- <dig> cells disrupted e-cadherin and β-catenin localization at adherens junctions, but did not alter localization of either tight junction protein occludin or zo- <dig> , demonstrating that the actions of pp6c are highly localized and specific. the endogenous e-cadherin was removed from the cell-cell junctions into a juxtamembrane region and also was dispersed throughout the cytosol. treatment of the cells with casein kinase- <dig>  inhibitor ic- <dig> prevented this relocalization of e-cadherin in response to knockdown of pp6c . the rescue of the pp6c knock down phenotype by inhibition of ck <dig> is consistent with the idea that these enzymes were opposing one another.

to analyze the redistribution of e-cadherin we performed line scanning densitometry perpendicular to the margins of cell-cell junctions. the fluorescent intensity of immunostaining for endogenous e-cadherin was quantified along this axis , fitted to a gaussian curve and scored for the full width at half maximum height  . experiments were independently replicated and as many as  <dig> individual scans collectively analyzed to show a statistically significant  increase in peak width due to pp6c knockdown, and this was rescued to control levels by addition of ic- <dig> . immunoblotting showed dox induced shrna-mediated knock down of endogenous pp6c, without a change in the levels of pp2a or e-cadherin . we concluded that pp6c was required for maintenance of e-cadherin at adherens junctions, and this likely involved reversing ck <dig> phosphorylation, probably a site in the cytoplasmic tail of e-cadherin.

substitution of ser <dig> prevents effects of pp6c knockdown on e-cadherin localization
residue ser <dig> in murine e-cadherin  has been established as a substrate for ck <dig>  and phosphorylation at this site shown to be critical for internalization of e-cadherin off the cell surface  <cit> . we examined the localization of epitope-tagged wild type  and a s846a mutant of murine e-cadherin in caco- <dig> cells. we observed that knockdown of pp6c dispersed wt e-cadherin from its plasma membrane localization, mimicking the effects on endogenous e-cadherin . line scans across cell-cell junctions  visualized in the fluorescent microscopic images  were fitted to gaussian curves and analyzed for fwhm . statistical analyses of dozens of scans showed a significant  2-fold increase in fwhm of wt e-cadherin due to pp6c knockdown . the behavior of this tagged version of e-cadherin mimicked the behavior of the endogenous protein . on the other hand, the s846a mutant of e-cadherin was resistant to effects of pp6c knockdown . these data support the conclusion that pp6c-dependent dephosphorylation of this ser residue promotes surface localization of e-cadherin in adherens junctions.

discussion
e-cadherin is regulated by phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail and ser phosphorylation occurs in a region of densely spaced sites near the c-terminus of the protein . phosphorylation of multiple ser sites in e-cadherin by ck <dig> and gsk <dig> was reported to enhance association with β-catenin  <cit> . multiple ser to ala substitutions to prevent phosphorylation of this region reduced e-cadherin dependent cell-cell contacts and ala-substituted e-cadherin displayed reduced binding to skp <dig> that initiates degradation of e-cadherin  <cit> . on the other hand, phosphorylation of ser in e-cadherin by ck <dig> promoted internalization of e-cadherin  <cit> . the ck <dig> site was mapped to ser <dig>  that lies amongst the ck <dig> and gsk <dig> phosphorylation sites. thus, ser phosphorylation of e-cadherin is critical for its stability and intracellular distribution. although the kinases involved have been identified, essentially nothing is known about the protein phosphatases that control the phosphorylation of these functionally important sites.

here we provide new evidence for the specific action of ser/thr phosphatase pp <dig> in the regulation of e-cadherin. we found pp6c localizes to adherens junctions of human epithelial cells and stably associates with e-cadherin-catenin complexes. we provide evidence for direct protein-protein interaction between pp6c and the e-cadherin cytoplasmic tail. inducible knock down of pp6c caused internalization of e-cadherin and either chemical inhibition of ck <dig> or mutation of a single ser to ala in e-cadherin completely prevented the effects of pp <dig> knockdown on e-cadherin localization. these results provide definitive evidence that pp6c opposes ck <dig> for phosphorylation of the conserved aaslss sequence in e-cadherin. we speculate that phosphorylation of this site supports binding to a protein involved in e-cadherin internalization. the simplest explanation for our results is direct dephosphorylation of this ser in e-cadherin by pp <dig>  even though we have not demonstrated that reaction with purified proteins. recombinant pp6c is not available, and besides phosphatases have historically shown broad reactivity in vitro with various substrates. it is possible that e-cadherin becomes dephosphorylated at the ck <dig> site by a pp6-dependent mechanism that does not involve direct dephosphorylation.

in high density epithelial cells we observed a striking accumulation of the pp6c protein. we speculate that there may be a positive feedback loop from adherens junctions involving activation of transcription to elevate pp <dig> levels to drive dephosphorylation of e-cadherin to stabilize intercellular junctions. we examined information on the ppp6c transcription start site on chromosome  <dig> q <dig>  available from encode . there are chip-seq results for over  <dig> transcription factors and peaks of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> acetylation , an epigenetic mark characteristic of active enhancers, but no obvious connections to catenin signaling. the nature of any feedback signal to activate pp6c transcription remains to be discovered.

in animal cells pp <dig> has been proposed to exist as a heterotrimeric enzyme comprised of the pp <dig> catalytic subunit, one of the three subunits containing a helical-repeat saps domain  <cit>  plus one of three ankyrin repeat domain  subunits  <cit> . in some cell lines the levels of pp6c and saps appear to be co-dependent in response to knockdown by rnai, suggesting the proteins do not survive separately, but only as complexes  <cit> . our results indicate pp6c can associate with other proteins, such as e-cadherin, without participation of saps. we provide evidence for stable association of pp <dig> with e-cadherin in immunocomplexes and direct protein-protein binding assay. we do not know what region of the e-cadherin intracellular domain is involved in binding to pp6c. there is evidence that pp6c associates with the autophagy protein beclin without involvement of a saps subunit , reinforcing the idea that pp6c may have other binding partners in cells.

other ser/thr phosphatases could also have a role in the maintenance of adherens junctions. for example it has been reported that pp2a associates with e-cadherin in mdck cells  <cit> , however we did not detect pp2a in anti-e-cadherin immunoprecipitations . previous studies found phosphatase pp2a associated with occludin in tight junctions in caco- <dig> cells, not with adherens junctions  <cit> . this suggests that pp2a and pp <dig> are targeted to different junctions within the same cell. regardless, our results point to a specific requirement for pp6c in dephosphorylation of e-cadherin to support cell surface localization. this implies that changes in the levels or activity of pp <dig> due to genetic or environmental factors would cause phenotypic alterations of epithelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
pp6c associates with e-cadherin-catenin complexes in adherens junctions without a saps subunit and is required to oppose casein kinase- <dig> to maintain cell surface localization of e-cadherin. there is cell density-dependent feedback signaling to enhance pp6c transcription and boost mrna and protein levels.
