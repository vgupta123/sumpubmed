BACKGROUND
major royal jelly proteins and yellow proteins in insecta, together with an orphan protein found in deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation tolerant bacterium, form a protein family named the mrjp/yellow family  <cit> . major royal jelly proteins  are initially identified as the major content of royal jelly  proteins, constituting 80%–90% of the total rj proteins which play a central role in the honeybee development  <cit> . a recent report indicates that mrjp/yellow protein family in apis mellifera includes at least  <dig> mrjps  and two homologues of the drosophila yellow proteins, am-yellow and am-yellow-f  <cit> . most mrjps have the characteristic that there are repetitive segments encoding long homopetptides at the carboxyl terminal. the structure is thought of as the accessible form of storing nutrition  <cit> . apis mellifera mrjp/yellow proteins may have higher physiological functions because at least one of the members expresses in the brain's mushroom body of the honeybee  <cit> . at the n-terminal of mrjp/yellow protein, there is a strong hydrophobic sequence functioning as putative signal peptide  <cit> . it should be noted that the term mrjp was created before knowing their physico-chemical properties. later it was established that these proteins have physico-chemical properties similar to those of ovalbumin  or serum albumin  which are typical albunoid proteins and therefore researchers have proposed to rename major royal jelly proteins as apalbumins. thus, apalbumin- <dig> will be designated as mrjp <dig>  apalbumin- <dig> as mrjp <dig>  and so on. this new terminology of honeybee larval diet proteins corresponds with reality that these proteins are presented not only in royal jelly, but also in worker and drone jellies  <cit> .

the drosophila yellow gene is related to normal larval and adult pigmentation and movement, and the mating behavior of male and female  <cit> . it encodes a simple transcription unit of two exons, encoding a  <dig> aa protein. further researches indicate several novel drosophila genes possessing a high identical mrjp conserved domain are termed as the yellow family  <cit> . with the achievement of the drosophila melanogaster genome-sequencing project  <cit> , the drosophila melanogaster yellow gene family has grown to a total of more than  <dig> genes  <cit> . the drosophila melanogaster yellow-y and ebony genes together determine the degree of melanization and its pattern  <cit> . the yellow-f and yellow-f <dig> genes have dopachrome-conversion enzyme activity that likely playing an important role during melanin biosynthesis in drosophila melanogaster larvae, pupae and adults  <cit> . furthermore, mrjp-like protein was also found and identified in the blood-sucking insect, possessing an agglutinin activity and probably intermediating in the evolution from yellow-like function towards royal jelly components  <cit> .

to date, no related protein has been found in the non-insect metazoans except the orphan protein in the red pigmented bacterium d. radiodurans with 59% similarity to the drosophila yellow protein  <cit> . however, there is no report of a mrjp/yellow family protein in the lepidoptera. with the declaration of the completion of est library  <cit>  and the achievement of genome sequence draft project  <cit>  in bombyx mori, the silkworm, as a model organism has been attracting more scientists. we searched the silkworm est library by the blast method and found eight partial mrjp/yellow family genes in bombyx mori. using the smart™ race amplification method we completed seven of the cdna sequences. the nucleotide acid and amino acid structures of the genes were analyzed, and the tissue expression profiles and phylogenetic analysis were also studied.

RESULTS
identification of bm yellow protein family in the est library
we obtained  <dig> ests of different length from the silkworm est library, using the conserved domain in yellow protein of drosophila melanogaster to blast. we grouped and combined these sequences using the programs of dnastar and clustal x software packages. seven bm yellow protein family genes   each contained a mrjp conserved domain were gained.

sequence analysis in bm yellow protein family
bm-yellow-d
the biggest group consisted of  <dig> ests derived from midgut, wing discs, ovary, fat body and pheromone gland. the assembled contig contained  <dig>  nucleotide acids with incomplete 3'-terminal. primers  were designed depending on the assembled sequence, and 3'-race was performed using midgut cdna as the template. then the obtained 3'-race product was combined with the assembled contig and named bm-yellow-d. the sequence of bm-yellow-d was  <dig>  bp long, containing an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp encoding a protein  <dig> amino acids long. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail and no usual polyadenylation  signal was found. the first  <dig> amino acids of the protein made a putative signal peptide and the location between amino acid residue  <dig> and residue  <dig> was the mrjp conserved domain.

the sequence of the bm-yellow-d cdna was almost completely covered by the sequence  readings from shotgun sequencing of the silkworm genome. this enabled us to identify the  <dig> introns in the genomic locus of bm-yellow-d. considering the incompleteness of the fifth intron, two primers  for pcr were designed basing on known sequences , to complete the genomic sequence of bm-yellow-d. surprisingly, we got several amplification products of different sizes and the sequencing results showed that there might be an extensively high repeat area.

bm-yellow-fa
fifteen ests from pheromone gland, fat body or embryo were combined in an assembled contig  <dig>  bp long absent 3'-terminal. after combined with the 3'-race product from pheromone gland, a  <dig>  bp cdna was gained and named bm-yellow-fa. bm-yellow-fa contained an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp encoding a protein  <dig> amino acids long. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail,  <dig> bp upstream of which was a consensus polyadenylation signal . a putative signal peptide was found in the first  <dig> amino acids of the protein. the complete mrjp conserved region stretched from residues  <dig> to  <dig> 

shotgun sequence readings of the silkworm genome  could cover the whole of the bm-yellow-fa cdna. that enabled us to deduce that the genomic locus of bm-yellow-fa contained  <dig> introns.

bm-yellow-c
bm-yellow-c was combined by the assembled contig  <dig>  bp long, consisting of  <dig> ests from pheromone gland, ovary and fat body, and the 3'-terminal fragment obtained by 3'-race from pheromone gland. the gene was composed of  <dig>  bp and contained an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp, encoding a protein  <dig> amino acids long with a putative signal peptide in the first  <dig> amino acids and a mrjp conserved region in 118– <dig> amino acid residues. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail. no typical polyadenylation  signal was found.

shotgun sequence readings of the silkworm genome  covered partial of the bm-yellow-c cdna, which enabled us to conclude at least  <dig> introns were contained in the genomic locus of bm-yellow-c.

bm-yellow-fb
a  <dig> bp long assembled contig consisted of  <dig> ests from pheromone gland, fat body or embryo. we obtained the 3'-terminal fragment by 3'-race from ovary and combined as the bm-yellow-c gene  <dig>  bp long. the gene contained an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp, encoding a protein  <dig> amino acids long, with a putative signal peptide in the first  <dig> amino acids and a mrjp conserved region spanning 132– <dig> amino acid residues. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail,  <dig> bp upstream which was the consensus polyadenylation signal .

shotgun sequence reading of the silkworm genome  covered all the bm-yellow-fb cdna. that enabled us to conclude that the genomic locus of bm-yellow-fb contained  <dig> introns.

bm-yellow-b
the est from pheromone gland   <dig> bp long fell in the smallest contig. we got a long 3'-race product from pheromone gland and assembled it with the est sequence, and obtained the  <dig>  bp bm-yellow-b gene. the gene contained an open reading frame of  <dig>  bp, encoding a protein  <dig> amino acids long with a putative signal peptide in the first  <dig> amino acids and a mrjp conserved domain spanning 135– <dig> amino acid residues. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail, and a consensus polyadenylation signal  was located only  <dig> bp upstream of the tail.

shotgun sequence readings of the silkworm genome  covered the whole cdna of bm-yellow-b and no intron was identified in the genomic locus of bm-yellow-b.

bm-yellow-f2
two ests from ovary and brain composed an assembled contig  <dig> bp long. the 3'-terminal fragment was obtained by 3'-race from ovary and combined with the former assembled contig, composing the cdna of bm-yellow-f <dig>  which was  <dig>  bp long. bm-yellow-f <dig> cdna contained an open reading frame of  <dig> bp, encoding a protein  <dig> amino acids long with a putative signal peptide in the first  <dig> amino acids and an incomplete mrjp conserved region spanning 125– <dig> amino acid residues. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail, while no consensus polyadenylation signal  was found.

shotgun sequence readings of the silkworm genome  covered partial of the cdna of bm-yellow-f <dig>  that enabled us to conclude that at least  <dig> introns were contained in the genomic locus of bm-yellow-f <dig> 

bm-yellow
a  <dig>  bp assembled contig consisted of  <dig> ests from compound eye, pheromone gland, ovary and fat body was named bm-yellow. with the result of 3'-race, we got a cdna of  <dig>  bp contained a complete open reading frame, encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids. a putative signal peptide was found in the first  <dig> amino acids and a mrjp conserved domain was located from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues. the stop codon was located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail, and a consensus polyadenylation signal  was found located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly  tail.

shotgun sequence readings of the silkworm genome  covered partial of the bm-yellow cdna. it showed that no less than  <dig> introns were in the genomic locus of bm-yellow.

alignment and phylogeny of bm yellow protein family proteins
homology alignment was performed between the yellow protein families of drosophila melanogaster and bombyx mori at amino acid sequence level. the result showed that bm-yellow-d shared the highest identity with yellow-d <dig> among drosophila melanogaster yellowfamily . bm-yellow-fa and bm-yellow-fb both shared the highest identity with yellow-f , while bm-yellow-f <dig> shared with yellow-f <dig> . bm-yellow-c shared the highest identity with yellow-c , and bm-yellow-b was the most similar to yellow-b with an identity of 23%. bm-yellow was mostly homologous to drosophila melanogaster yellow .

the protein sequences of the bm yellow protein family, with dm-yellow and am-yellow, were aligned using the clustal x software package and modified by genedoc software . the homology existed in the mrjp conserved domain of all the bm-yellow family genes, but its similarity was lower than that of the apis mellifera mrjp/yellow protein family and the drosophila melanogaster yellow protein family. for example, though bm-yellow-fa and bm-yellow-fb shared the highest identity, it was only  <dig> %. surprisingly, some unique amino acid sequences were found in the members of the bm yellow protein family such as residues  <dig> to  <dig> in bm-yellow-fa,  <dig> to  <dig> in bm-yellow-b and the c-terminal of bm-yellow-d and bm-yellow-b. the above information indicated that complicated divergence existed in the bm yellow protein family.

the phylogenetic tree was calculated from the aligned protein sequences using the neighbor-joining  method . the bombyx mori yellow protein family, apis mellifera yellow and drosophila yellow formed three monophyletic groups independently. in the bm yellow protein family group, bm-yellow underwent the earliest divergence within the family.bm-yellow-c, bm-yellow-fa, bm-yellow-fb and bm-yellow-f <dig> might be classified into one paraphyletic sub-group. the other paraphyletic sub-group included bm-yellow-d and bm-yellow-b. the protein distance analysis showed that there was moderation support for an earliest divergence of bm-yellow among the known members. the results of phylogenetic analyses showed that the bm yellow protein family genes clearly formed a monophyletic group distant from apis mellifera and drosophila melanogaster.

tissue expression patterns of bm yellow protein family
the rt-pcr was done to analyze tissue specific expression patterns of the bm yellow protein family genes on the 3rd and the 8th days  of the 5th instar larvae . the tissues included head, wing discs, midgut, silk glands, fat body, malpighian tubules, body wall, hemocyte, trachea, and gonads . bm-yellow-d and bm-yellow-b were transcripted in all the tissues, therein a low expression was observed of bm-yellow-d in silk glands and bm-yellow-b in the testis of matured silkworm.bm-yellow-fa was obviously found not expressed in hemocyte. notably high levels of bm-yellow-c transcripts were readily detectable in all tissues except hemocyte. bm-yellow-fb was not found in malpighian tubules, midgut and silk glands but found in others. bm-yellow-f <dig> was only expressed in head, wing discs, body wall, pheromone gland and trachea. bm-yellow, which was most similar to dm-yellow, was expressed in most of the organs studied in the experiment. but it was hardly detectable in malpighian tubules, silk glands, fat body and body wall. we would note that even all of the numbers of bm-yellow family had high expression level in gonads.

discussion
we obtained seven genes coding proteins each contains a conserved mrjp domain from the present silkworm est library and named the silkworm yellow protein family genes. each protein in the family possessed a putative cleavable signal peptide composed of a hydrophobic sequence,  <dig> to  <dig> residues long at the n-terminal, and a mrjp conserved domain. in the silkdb  <cit> , seven genes predicted from the silkworm genome draft sequence, each possess a putative mrjp conserved domain have been named as bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  bmb <dig>  and bmb <dig>  however, our results are different from theirs.

for the confidence of bm yellow protein family members, we designed primer <dig> and primer <dig> based on the est sequences that included 5' non-coding region except bm-yellow-d. in order to validate the assemblage of bm-yellow-d, we designed two primers containing complete coding region , and successfully cloned the entire open reading frame from the midgut cdna. the length of bm-yellow-f <dig> gene was the shortest and its mrjp conserved domain was truncated. but the search of its genomic sequence revealed that contig <dig>  covered all the sequence of the last exon . all the above results proved the credibility of the seven cloned bm yellow protein genes.

the apis mellifera mrjp/yellow family and the drosophila melanogaster yellow family resulted from a series of events of a duplication and subsequent divergence  <cit> . what analysis of cdna sequence and genomic structure of bm yellow protein family genes of the silkworm demonstrated are as follows: on one hand, the seven complete members encoding various lengths of amino acids,  <dig> to  <dig> long, contained stretches of unique amino acid sequences in their coding regions; on the other hand, some of the 0– <dig> introns included extensive repeat sequences. but only 1– <dig> introns were included in the  <dig> yellow family members of drosophila melanogaster. we assumed that the bm yellow protein family also originated in the same manner, but the evolutionary procedure was more complex than that in drosophila and apis.

nothing has been reported on the cloning and function of lepidopteran yellow protein family until recently. from the tissue expression profiles, we found that all the seven genes of the bm yellow protein family were transcripted in head, wing discs, body wall and gonads . as bm-yellow-d and bm-yellow-b were observed in every tissue and possessed similar tissue expression patterns, they were also classified into a paraphyletic sub-group in the phylogenetic tree. then we could speculate that bm-yellow-d and bm-yellow-b had important roles in silkworm development and had similar physiological functions. the bm-yellow-fa, bm-yellow-fb and bm-yellow-f <dig> had a similar distribution in the tissue expression profiles and had the best similarity to drosophila yellow-f and yellow-f <dig> which had the dopachrome-conversion enzyme activity. in addition, the three members were classified into a paraphyletic sub-group in the phylogenetic tree. these indicated that bm-yellow-fa, bm-yellow-fb and bm-yellow-f <dig> might have functions in pigmentation. preliminary experiments showed that appearance of the pupa was dark black, similar to the phenotype of black pupa due to the over expression of bm-yellow-d in pupal stage via a weakened pathogenic baculoviral expression system . this indicated that bm-yellow-d might be in a close relation with cuticle pigmentation too. the function of drosophila yellow members is relative to reproduction, and studies showed that yellow-g and yellow-g <dig> in drosophila playing a female-specific role in egg development  <cit> . all the members of the bm yellow protein family had a high transcription level in ovary and testis. this suggested that bm yellow protein family were also involved to the reproduction.

CONCLUSIONS
bombyx mori yellow protein family is the first reported mrjp/yellow family to date in the lepidoptera. it is composed of at least seven members each has one mrjp domain. the low identity of their signal peptides and their mrjp conserved domains, and the highly diversity in cdna and genomic structure and also unique tissue expression patterns indicated that the members of bm yellow protein family might have various functions in the silkworm development.
