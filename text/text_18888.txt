BACKGROUND
the insect order plecoptera  diverged as early as in the early late carboniferous  <cit> , and stem-relatives of most of its constituent families have been recovered from mesozoic strata . however the pteronarcyidae , a prominent family as far as the size of individuals is concerned, has never been recovered in the fossil record. as a consequence it is generally assumed that the family diverged very recently .

in this paper, we report on a large set of specimens belonging to a new fossil species of stonefly, unearthed from the middle jurassic daohugou locality . our comparative analysis of wing venation and body characters unambiguously demonstrates that the new species is a pteronarcyidae. its affinities within this family are elucidated and the implications of this new occurrence on divergence date estimates for stonefly lineages are addressed.

RESULTS
in order to assess the affinities of a newly discovered fossil species, we conducted a comparative analysis of characters of the external morphology. firstly we complemented the available data on the wing venation of pteronarcella badia   <cit> , a close relative of the new species. then we address systematics aspects above the species level , followed by species-level aspects.

wing venation variability in pteronarcella badia
during our survey, we discovered that there was a lack of data on the wing venation of pteronarcella badia, a critical species for comparison. an incomplete view of a forewing is available in needham & claassen   <cit>  , and a fore- and a hind wing are illustrated by nelson & hanson  <dig>  <cit> : . we investigated nine macropterous specimens . the typical morphology of the species is represented by fig. 1a–d for males and fig. 1e–h for females. in both fore- and hind wing, it involves a 3- or 4-branched rp, a 2-branched m , a simple cua, and no cross-veins in the area between r/rp and m basal to the first fork of m. in forewings, the rp-ma cross-vein is long, and aa <dig> has 2– <dig> branches.fig.  <dig> wing venation of pteronarcella badia . a-d, specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , photographs and drawings of left forewing and left hind wing; , specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , photographs and drawings of left forewing and left hind wing; , photos of detail of forewing venation variability; , specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , left forewing; , specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , left forewing; .1-k. <dig>  specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , right and left forewing respectively; , specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , left forewing; , specimen mnhn.ep <dig> , right forewing




unusual morphologies were documented: one individual exhibited a short rp-ma cross-vein in both forewings ; one individual exhibited a cua forked distally in both forewings ; one individual exhibited a long stem of aa <dig> ; another one, not illustrated, has also such a distal fork in one of the forewings ; one individual has cup fused for some distance with cua ; one individual has a branched ma ; one unusual individual has an incomplete cross-vein in the area between r/rp and m basal to the fork of m in the right forewing, and mp fused with cua in the right hind wing, among other aspects .

composition: all recent species currently assigned to the genus pteronarcys . the species sinitshenkovae

discussion: wings of both cladotypic species have been illustrated in an earlier publication  <cit> . the character state defining the taxon pteronarcys  can be seen as composed of two characters regarding the area between r/rp and m, and basal to the fork of m, viz. its width , and the occurrence of cross-veins . however, to our knowledge, the state ‘area of regular width’ always co-occurs with the state ‘cross-veins absent’, and the state ‘area broad’ always co-occurs with the state ‘cross-veins present’. indeed a broadening of the space between two veins is likely to decrease the repression of cross-veins formation. in other words, the two conditions are most likely correlated.

our literature survey revealed no earlier association of the proposed defining character state along with a taxon . because the composition of the taxon herein defined matches that of the genus pteronarcys, we propose to adapt this name under cladotypic nomenclature.

discussion: the interpretation of the genitalia of specimen cnu-ple-nn- <dig> is based on a comparison with the description of extant taxa of the pteronarcyidae by nelson and hanson  on extant pteronarcyidae, and is included in the main discussion section.

the distinction between the conditions ‘branched mp’ and ‘fusion of a branch of cua with mp’ proved difficult to confirm in several cases. for example, in the case of the specimen cnu-ple-nn- <dig>  the left forewing is interpreted to have a branch of cua fused with mp , but a branched mp remains a plausible interpretation, given that the presumed mp fork is located in a very basal position. however, the branching pattern of cua in the forewing shows variation in the number of branches, usually with four to five branches, rarely with three  or six or more .

we found no reason to distinguish different species within the fossils we examined. data on extant species of pteronarcys  show that the observed size variation, and the occurrence of a branched mp, is subjected to intra-specific variation. the branching pattern of aa <dig> in forewing of pteronarcyidae  also shows a certain degree of variation, in particular in pteronarcys spp. , which can also be observed in the fossil specimens: the first branch of aa <dig> can be simple or forked ; and the first branch of aa2α branched distally or proximally . therefore, the assignment of all the specimens listed above to a single species is well supported.

discussion
before proceeding with the evolutionary implications of our discovery, a note on nomenclatural aspects is necessary. under the cladotypic nomenclature all taxon names are written in italics with a capital letter. traditional genus names and cladotypic names can therefore be confused. however, the name of the newly erected genus  is also used in association with a cladotypic definition. consequently the combination ‘pteroliriope sinitshenkovae’ is valid under both procedures. in addition the adaptation of the pre-existing genus name ‘pteronarcys’ under cladotypic nomenclature leaves the association of this name with the specific epithets of its constituent species unchanged . in such cases both procedures reach a similar outcome  <cit> . however the cladotypic procedure has that advantage that the exclusion of sinitshenkovae from the taxon pteronarcys can be made explicit with the minimal combination ‘pteroliriope nec pteronarcys sinitshenkovae’ . unless mentioned, this section will be further continued under the cladotypic framework. in other words, all taxon names written in italics are to be understood as cladotypic names. species are referred to by their specific epithet associated with authorship data .

systematic affinities of pteroliriope sinitshenkovae tax. et sp. nov.
the distribution of the states of selected characters is summarized in fig.  <dig>  at first glance, the state ‘in the distal half of the wing, in the areas between branches of m and cua, occurrence of numerous cross-veins’  is a very distinctive trait . this trait is shared with carpenteri béthoux et al.,  <dig>  <cit> , which is sister-group related to all other plecoptera, with most antarctoperlaria , and, within the systellognatha, with some perlidae, zhaoi liu et al.  <dig>  <cit>  , and the pteronarcyidae.fig.  <dig> distribution of selected character states, . a, in the distal half of the wing, in the areas between branches of m and cua, crossveins absent  vs. numerous ; , first cross-vein in the area between the anterior wing margin and scp not short, strong and oblique  vs. short, strong and oblique; , forewing, number of aa <dig> branches, three or less  vs. more than three ; , fore- and hind wing, m occasionally with more than two branches, no  vs. yes ; , forewing, area between r/rp and m basal to the fork of m with regular width and without cross-veins  vs. broad and with cross-veins ; , forewing, cross-veins in the areas between branches of aa <dig>  none occurring  vs. occurring 




the occurrence of a short, oblique strong first cross-vein in the area between the anterior wing margin and scp  allows the assignment of sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. to the systellognatha, as this state is unique to the group . the character state ‘in hind wing, cua branched’  is congruent with the previous one: indeed this state occurs only in some diamphipnoidae and in systellognatha . the assignment of sinitshenkovae
tax. et sp. nov. to the systellognatha, and, more specifically to the pteronarcyidae, is well corroborated.

the character state ‘in forewing, aa <dig> with more than three branches’  confirms this statement: among plecoptera it is known only in carpenteri, the styloperlidae , and pteronarcys spp. it is noted that aa <dig> is seemingly forked in styloperlidae . however, given that aa <dig> is simple in all other plecoptera, we assume that a fusion of the anterior-most branch of aa <dig> with aa <dig> occurs in the styloperlidae. this interpretation implies an aa <dig> with more than  <dig> branches in the family.

another useful character state is ‘in fore- and hind wing, m occasionally with more than two branches’ . among plecoptera, this state occurs only in carpenteri and pteronarcys spp. . affinities of the new species with pteronarcys spp. are further confirmed by its large size. according to stewart & stark , among the pteronarcyidae, a body length above 23 mm is diagnostic of the genus pteronarcys . the species sinitshenkovae
sp. nov., with a body length of 25 mm, is then likely to be closely related to this genus . also, both sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. and pteronarcys spp. have an area between ra and rp in the forewing with a constriction opposite the ra-rp cross-vein, a trait absent in pteronarcella badia .

finally sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. lacks a character state shared by all pteronarcys spp., namely ‘in forewing, area between r/rp and m basal to the fork of m broad, with cross-veins’ . it can then be excluded from this genus. the proposed new genus  is therefore supported.

we have examined the relevance of additional characters. the occurrence of cross-veins between branches of aa <dig> has been indicated as diagnostic of the pteronarcyidae  <cit> . however this state is not present in sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. . given the number of character states supporting the close affinities of this species with pteronarcys spp., we assume that the occurrence of cross-veins in the anal area is homoplasic within pteronarcyidae.

regarding characters of external morphology other than wing venation, stewart & harper  list the occurrence of three ocelli as diagnostic of the pteronarcyidae . three ocelli are present in sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. but its phylogenetic relevance is unclear as this condition is widespread among plecoptera.

we have also attempted to interpret the male terminalia of sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. based on the very well-preserved specimen cnu-ple-nn- <dig>  and on data on terminalia of extant species  <cit> . we need to emphasize here that the interpretation of terminalia in fossil insect imprints is made difficult by the overlap of elements initially located at different levels. inconclusive attempts have been made on material from the same locality  <cit> .

we propose to compare the fossil species  with badia  and pteronarcys scotti ricker,  <dig>  . the various elements we identified in sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. were more easily matched with those recognized in badia. for example, both sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. and badia possess well-developed lateral braces  and pointed paragenital plates . we focused on the lobes of the hemitergites of the tenth segment , because they exhibit an elaborate shape. in badia the hemitergites of the tenth tergum are mediodorsally divided into two lobes . in pteronarcys scotti three lobes can be identified . in sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. three lobes can be identified , but their shapes differ strongly from those in pteronarcys scotti. we considered a number of hypotheses of topographic homology and selected the most parsimonious one . to assist comparison we opted for the following color-coding: ahl, light green; mhl, middle green; phl, dark green; a lobe herein assumed to encompass both mhl and phl  is indicated by shaded limits .fig.  <dig> comparation of posterior part of male postabdomen of three species  belonging to all known genera of the family pteronarcyidae , with same color coding for the same segments , and the hypothesis of evolution of segments of the hemitergal lobes . a. <dig>  b. <dig>  pteronarcella badia   <cit> , modified from fig.  <dig> in  <cit> ; a. <dig>  b. <dig>  pteroliriope sinitshenkovae tax. et sp. nov.; a. <dig>  b. <dig>  pteronarcys scotti ricker,  <dig>  <cit> , modified from fig.  <dig> in nelson and hanson, 1971




in order to explain the occurrence of two lobes in badia and three in pteronarcys scotti, one possibility is that the posterior-most lobe in the former divides into two . under this scenario  sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. can be interpreted as exhibiting an intermediate condition, with the pointed, posterior process being a weakly individualized phl. in summary the development of phl would compose an apomorphy shared by sinitshenkovae
sp. nov. and pteronarcys spp. this hypothesis suggests that a long and narrow ahl is a plesiomorphy . this investigation supports the view that pteroliriope sinitshenkovae
tax. et sp. nov. is more closely related to pteronarcys spp. than to species of the genus pteronarcella, a hypothesis already supported by characters evaluated above.

evolutionary implications
most contributions on the systematics of fossil stoneflies make extensive use of paraphyletic taxa. this approach is an impediment for current approaches focusing on divergence date estimates, because the support for the placement of particular fossil species cannot be easily evaluated. also, the positive identification of fossil antarctoperlaria is hindered by the lack of data on putative derived character states in the wing venation. yet the fossil record indicates that by the jurassic, crown-plecoptera had already experienced a sequence of divergence events. among the euholognatha, both lineages leuctrida and capniida were already present  <cit>  . the discovery of pteroliriope nec pteronarcys sinitshenkovae complements this approach for the systellognatha, for which divergence dates have been difficult to estimate. it demonstrates that the pteronarcyoidea and the perloidea  had already diverged ca.  <dig> million years ago, and that divergence events within the pteronarcyoidea had already occurred.

given that the earliest members of a given lineage are unlikely to be recovered from the fossil record, the recently proposed  <dig> million years divergence date estimate between the two major lineages of plecoptera  proposed by misof et al.  clearly is an underestimate, given that sinitshenkovae is nested well within the systellognatha therefore, this deep divergence event very probably took place in the triassic, or even in the permian.

CONCLUSIONS
the abundant data on pteroliriope sinitshenkovae
tax. et sp. nov. allowed us to demonstrate that this species belongs to the pteronarcyidae, hence the group had already diverged ca.  <dig> mya. our studies demonstrate the need for investigations of the systematics of fossil stoneflies to further refine divergence date estimates for plecopteran lineages. in that endeavour the positive exclusion of fossil species from particular taxa, formalized with combinations such as ‘pteroliriope nec pteronarcys sinitshenkovae’, will be a useful methodological improvement.
