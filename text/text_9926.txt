BACKGROUND
oocyte developmental competence can be defined as the oocyte ability to be fertilized and to subsequently develop into a normal embryo. in fish, molecular mechanisms that control oocyte developmental competence remain poorly understood. in the past few years, transcriptomic investigations have been initiated to tentatively link oocyte transcriptome and oocyte developmental potential in order to identify key genes involved in the control of oocyte developmental competence  <cit> . while these types of approaches have been successful, information on the specific molecular mechanisms that make a good oocyte are still limited. one alternative way to fully understand the molecular mechanisms controlling oocyte quality is to study genes that are specifically or predominantly expressed in the oocyte. in mammals it has been shown that the so called "oocyte-specific" genes can affect folliculogenesis, fertilization and early development  <cit> . these genes have been extensively studied in mammals. yet, very little information is available about those genes in fish despite the recent identification of ovarian-predominant genes in zebrafish  <cit> . the purpose of the present study was therefore to identify and characterize genes exhibiting a predominant oocyte expression in fish. taking advantage of the numerous murine tissue-specific libraries available in public databases, we used an in silico approach to identify genes exhibiting an oocyte-predominant expression in rainbow trout . our study led to the identification and characterization of five previously uncharacterized rainbow trout cdnas exhibiting an oocyte-specific, oocyte-predominant, or gonad-specific expression: zygote arrest  <dig> , v-mos moloney murine sarcoma viral oncogene-like protein , b-cell translocation gene , growth differentiation factor  <dig> , and muts homolog  <dig> .

RESULTS
zygote arrest  <dig> 
the nucleotide sequence of rainbow trout zar <dig> cdna was  <dig> bp in length  and presumably encoded for a 333-aa protein. the encoded protein  had an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda. the rainbow trout zar <dig> protein exhibited 64%, 60%, and 41% sequence identity with zebrafish , xenopus and human zar <dig> proteins respectively  and the phylogenetic analysis showed that rainbow trout zar <dig> was orthologous to zar <dig> proteins previously characterized in vertebrates . as previously reported for other species, the zar <dig> rainbow trout sequence exhibited an atypical plant homeo domain  finger in its c-terminal region . real-time pcr data showed that zar <dig> was strongly expressed in the ovary . the transcript was also present in unfertilized eggs thus demonstrating that trout zar <dig> is maternally-inherited. finally, zar <dig> transcript could be detected in testis but not in any other tissue. in the ovary, in situ hybridization data showed that zar <dig> was expressed in previtellogenic oocytes .

v-mos moloney murine sarcoma viral oncogene-like protein 
the nucleotide sequence of rainbow trout mos cdna was  <dig> bp in length  and presumably encoded for a 335-aa protein. the encoded protein  had an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda. the rainbow trout mos protein exhibited 62%, 51%, and 48% sequence identity with zebrafish, xenopus and human mos proteins respectively . the phylogenetic analysis showed that rainbow trout mos was orthologous to previously characterized mos proteins . real-time pcr data showed that mos was strongly expressed in the ovary . the transcript was also present in unfertilized eggs thus demonstrating that mos is maternally-inherited. finally, mos transcript could not be detected in any other tissue. in the ovary, in situ hybridization data showed that mos was expressed in previtellogenic oocytes .

b-cell translocation gene 
the nucleotide sequence of rainbow trout btg <dig> was  <dig> bp in length  and presumably encoded for a 237-aa protein. the encoded protein had an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda. the rainbow trout btg <dig> protein exhibited 64% and 48% sequence identity with a predicted zebrafish sequence and human btg <dig> protein respectively  and the phylogenic analysis showed that the rainbow trout btg <dig> was orthologous to btg <dig> proteins previously characterized in vertebrates . real-time pcr data showed that btg <dig> was strongly expressed in the ovary and in unfertilized eggs thus demonstrating that btg <dig> is maternally-inherited . the transcript was also present at lower levels in testis, kidney, intestine, gills and brain. finally, btg <dig> transcript could be detected at extremely low levels in several other tissues but not in spleen. in the ovary, in situ hybridization data showed that btg <dig> was expressed in the previtellogenic oocyte .

growth differentiation factor  <dig> 
for gdf <dig>  a partial rainbow trout cdna  was sequenced. the deduced rainbow trout gdf <dig> aa sequence exhibited 56%, 56%, 47%, 43% and 40% sequence identity with zebrafish, seabass, chicken, mouse and human gdf <dig> proteins respectively  and the phylogenic analysis clearly showed that the rainbow trout gdf <dig> was orthologous to gdf <dig> proteins previously characterized in teleosts   <cit> . in contrast, the topology of the tree vertebrates is not consistent with orthology relationships of gdf <dig> and bmp <dig> among vertebrates. this artifact could be due to a long-branch attraction phenomenon. real-time pcr data showed that gdf <dig> was strongly expressed in the ovary . the transcript was also present in unfertilized eggs thus demonstrating that gdf <dig> is maternally-inherited. finally, gdf <dig> transcript could not be detected in any other tissue. in the ovary, in situ hybridization data showed that gdf <dig> was expressed in previtellogenic oocytes .

muts homolog  <dig> 
for msh <dig>  a partial rainbow trout cdna  was sequenced. the deduced rainbow trout msh <dig> aa sequence exhibited 66% and 67% sequence identity with mouse and human msh <dig> proteins respectively while it exhibited 81% with an aa sequence deduced from the zebrafish genome  and the phylogenic analysis showed that the rainbow trout msh <dig> was orthologous to msh <dig> proteins previously characterized in vertebrates . real-time pcr data showed that msh <dig> was strongly expressed in the ovary and in the testis . the transcript was also present at low but detectable levels in unfertilized eggs but could not be detected in any other tissue.

discussion
zygote arrest  <dig> 
zygote arrest  <dig>  is a maternal-effect gene critical for the oocyte-to-embryo transition first identified in the mouse  <cit> . in this species, zar1-/- mice are infertile as most of their embryos stop developing at one-cell stage. since its discovery, zar <dig> was characterized and its expression studied in several vertebrates species including mammals  <cit> , chicken  <cit>  and xenopus  <cit> . by contrast, available data in fish are scarce. zebrafish  and pufferfish  zar <dig> sequences have been reported but no information is available on tissue or cellular expression of zar <dig> in any fish species. similarly to what has been reported in all studied vertebrate species  <cit> , the rainbow trout zar <dig> sequence exhibits an atypical phd motif  . the phylogenic analysis confirmed that the rainbow trout zar <dig> sequence was orthologous to the previously characterized vertebrate zar <dig> sequences including mouse zar <dig> . we also show, for the first time in any fish species, that rainbow trout zar <dig> is strongly expressed in the ovary whereas a limited expression is observed in metaphase ii oocytes . within the ovary, the expression was limited to the ooplasm as demonstrated by in situ hybridization. a very low signal was also observed in testis whereas no detectable expression was seen in any other tissue. in agreement with the results reported here, zar <dig> was shown to be expressed exclusively in the oocyte in chicken and mouse  <cit> . in contrast, expression in other tissues such as testis  <cit> , muscle  <cit> , lung  <cit> , and brain  <cit>  was also observed in various vertebrates species. in bovine, pig and human, the mrna expression observed in the testis results from an alternative splicing of the zar <dig> gene  <cit> . together, rainbow trout zar <dig> sequence and tissue expression are consistent with a role in oocyte/embryo development in fish that would be similar to what has been shown in the mouse. further studies are needed to thoroughly explore any relationship between zar <dig> expression in the oocyte and the acquisition of oocyte developmental competence.

v-mos moloney murine sarcoma viral oncogene-like protein 
in the mouse oocyte, mos encodes for a serine-threonine kinase involved in the maintenance of the meiotic arrest at metaphase ii  <cit> . a disruption of mos results in spontaneous parthenogenetic activation of oocytes  <cit> . in xenopus, mos has also long been implicated in the maintenance of the meiotic arrest  <cit> . in contrast, data on mos function and expression are extremely limited in fish. in the goldfish , mos is also involved in the metaphase ii arrest but does not participates in oocyte maturation  <cit> . in the present study, we observed that rainbow trout mos mrna is specifically expressed in the oocyte and not detected in any other tissue. interestingly, mos mrna is present in the unfertilized egg and is therefore maternally inherited. to the best of our knowledge, no information is available on the tissue distribution of the mos mrna in fish. in several mammalian species, mos mrna was only found in embryos, ovary and testis  <cit> . in addition, mos mrna was found to be expressed in the shark testis  <cit> . while it is unknown if rainbow trout mos is expressed in the testis at other stages, its expression in the oocyte is consistent with existing data in higher vertebrates. interestingly, the expression of mos mrna in the unfertilized egg suggests that mos could participate in early development in addition to its well documented role in meiotic arrest.

b-cell translocation gene 
btg <dig> also named ana and tob <dig> belongs to a family of proteins, the btg family; know for their anti-poliferative activity. in this family,  <dig> different proteins have been characterized in vertebrates  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis carried out in the present study clearly shows that we have identified the rainbow trout btg <dig> cdna. the btg <dig> gene was originally cloned in the mouse  <cit>  and reported to be expressed in several cell lines and in a wide variety of murine and human adult tissues  <cit> . similarly, porcine btg <dig> mrna was detected in most tissues assayed  <cit> . in the present study, btg <dig> mrna could be detected in many tissues at very low levels. however, a strong and predominant expression was monitored in the oocyte. together, our observations are consistent with existing data in mammals. however the oocyte-predominant expression of btg <dig> was never reported in any vertebrate species and a thorough expression analysis will be necessary in other vertebrate species. interestingly, several studies have shown that btg <dig>  another btg family member, was preferentially expressed in the chicken oocyte  <cit>  and in bovine reproductive tissues  <cit> . in fish, a recent transcriptomic study also revealed that btg <dig> was predominantly expressed in zebrafish ovarian tissue  <cit> .

in the mouse, the  <dig> kda protein encoded by the btg <dig> gene was cell cycle-dependent and peaked at the end of the g <dig> phase  <cit> . overexpression of the human cognate protein resulted in an impaired serum-induced cell cycle progression from the g0/g <dig> to s phase in nih3t <dig> cells  <cit> . more recently, in an attempt to study dna damaged-induced genes, btg <dig> was identified as a p <dig> target exhibiting an antiproliferative activity. together, the predominant oocyte-expression of rainbow trout btg <dig> and the antiproliferative activity of the cognate protein in mammals suggest that btg <dig> could play an important role in oocyte development in fish. in addition, the presence of btg <dig> mrna in the trout female gamete suggests a role for btg <dig> during early embryonic development, possibly in response to uv-induced dna damage.

growth differentiation factor  <dig> 
gdf <dig> is an oocyte-specific gene of the tgf beta superfamily involved in folliculogenesis. it participates in the successful transition from primary to secondary follicles and it was previously shown that gdf9-null mice are sterile  <cit> . in fish, gdf <dig> was very recently characterized in zebrafish  <cit>  and sea bass   <cit> . in the present study, the phylogenic analysis clearly showed that rainbow trout gdf <dig> was orthologous to those previously characterized gdf <dig> proteins in teleosts  <cit>  despite the difficulty to construct a reliable phylogenetic tree among vertebrate species. northern blot analysis showed an ovarian-specific expression of gdf <dig> in sea bass  <cit> . similarly, semi quantitative pcr showed a gdf <dig> expression in zebrafish oocyte and testis, and possibly a weak signal in follicular cells  <cit> . in the present study, we clearly showed using real-time pcr and in situ hybridization that rainbow trout gdf <dig> is exclusively expressed in the oocyte. interestingly, significant levels of gdf <dig> mrna were detected in the unfertilized egg, thus demonstrating that gdf <dig> is maternally inherited in rainbow trout. this observation is supported by semi-quantitative pcr data in zebrafish showing strong mrna levels at early blastula stage and sharp decrease during gastrulation  <cit> . while data on gdf <dig> in fish are scarce, the observed expression patterns are consistent with existing data in mammals. however, the functions of gdf <dig> in fish, including a possible role during early development, remain currently unknown.

muts homolog  <dig> 
muts homolog  <dig>  is a meiosis-specific gene belonging to the dna mismatch repair  system. in yeast  msh <dig> is required for reciprocal recombination and proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis i  <cit> . in humans, msh <dig> protein is only found in testis and ovary  <cit> . in mice, msh <dig> plays an essential role in the control of meiotic recombination and a disruption of this gene leads to male and female sterility due to meiotic failure  <cit> . in fish, very little is known about msh <dig>  to date, msh <dig> cdna and protein sequences were never characterized from any fish species and only sequences automatically predicted from zebrafish and tetraodon genomes are available. in rainbow trout, in agreement with existing data in mammals, the tissue distribution study shows a gonad-specific expression pattern and a strong testicular expression. in addition, high expression levels were found in the late vitellogenic ovary, immediately prior to meiosis resumption. based on existing data in yeast and mammals, it can be speculated that msh <dig> plays an important role in meiosis in fish. however, the msh <dig> mrna is also detected in metaphase ii oocytes at low levels. this indicates that msh <dig> mrna is maternally inherited and could thus participate in early development, possibly through dna mismatch repair functions. further investigations are needed to study the expression of msh <dig> in fish and characterize its participation in oocyte and embryo development.

CONCLUSIONS
using an in silico analysis, we have successfully identified  <dig> previously uncharacterized rainbow trout cdnas exhibiting an oocyte-specific, gonad-specific, or oocyte-predominant expression. among those  <dig> genes,  <dig> had never been characterized in any fish species. in addition, we report the oocyte-predominant expression of btg <dig> for the first time in any vertebrate species. finally, expression patterns of those  <dig> genes in fish and the functions of their orthologs in higher vertebrates strongly suggest that they might play an important role in fish oocyte development, meiotic arrest and early embryonic development.
