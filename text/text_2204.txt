BACKGROUND
small nucleolar rnas constitute one of the largest groups of ncrnas. they guide 2'-o-methylation and pseudouridylation of target rnas, mainly rrnas. snornas are divided into two groups according to the modification type: c/d box snornas guide 2'-o-methylation, while h/aca box snornas guide pseudouridylation  <cit> . to date, ~ <dig> rnas of both groups have been described  <cit> . c/d box snornas contain conserved c  and d  boxes brought together by complementary interactions between the snorna termini  <cit> . in addition, their  copies c' and d' are located internally  <cit> . four core proteins bind these boxes, nop <dig>  nop <dig>   <dig>  kda protein, and fibrillarin that catalyzes 2'-o-methylation  <cit> . upstream of the d and/or d' box there is an antisense element of 9- <dig> nucleotides that is complementary to one of the cellular rnas and is able to interact with it. a nucleotide in the cellular rna located four nucleotides from the d/d' box in the resulting rna/rna duplex is 2'-o-methylated  <cit> . h/aca box snornas carry boxes h  and aca  located at the base of two hairpins. the hairpins contain the antisense elements that are complementary to the target rnas and are capable to interact with them. four core proteins bind the h and aca boxes, nhp <dig>  nop <dig>  gar <dig>  and dyskerin; the latter catalyzes pseudouridylation  <cit> . some c/d and h/aca rnas called scarnas are localized to cajal bodies rather than to the nucleolus and guide modification of the snrnas  <cit> . according to the new nomenclature accepted for human snornas and scarnas, c/d snornas, h/aca snornas, and scarnas are designated as snord, snora, and scarna, respectively  <cit> .

nearly all snornas and scarnas genes in vertebrates are located within introns of other genes called host genes. the small rnas are processed from pre-mrnas of host genes  <cit> . only snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  scarna <dig>  and scarna <dig> are transcribed from intrinsic promoters  <cit> . most snornas guide rrna modifications. these modifications are essential for the ribosome function and probably contribute to rrna folding, maturation, and stability  <cit> . the modification pattern is conserved in vertebrates: most 2'-o-methylation sites are identical between xenopus laevis and human  <cit> . homologous snornas in different vertebrate species share the same antisense elements.

recently, vertebrate snornas have attracted the attention of several research groups  <cit> . in particular, our study of c/d snornas in vertebrates demonstrated a trend towards low copy numbers of c/d snorna genes in placental mammals  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that the set of c/d snornas is well conserved among vertebrates and that species-specific snornas guiding rrna modifications are extremely rare. shortly after this publication, zhu and coworkers reported opposite results  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that their conclusions are incorrect due to a number of technical errors. we have mainly focused our criticism on their paper in bmc genomics  <cit> ; however, we also considered two other recent publications from the same group which are based on the same erroneous approaches  <cit> .

RESULTS
lineage-specific and species-specific expression patterns of snornas in rhesus monkey are experimental artifacts
zhang et al. cloned  <dig> rhesus monkey snornas encoded by  <dig> genes  <cit> . all of them were homologs of known human snornas. expression of these rnas was tested by northern hybridization in the muscle of several vertebrate species. based on the results, zhang et al. claimed that most of the cloned snornas are not expressed in chicken, and some were not detected even in human and mouse . stated differently, they claimed lineage- or species-specific expression pattern for most of the cloned snornas .

this statement is contrary to the following. first, all snornas cloned from rhesus monkey have been previously found in human   <cit> . second, the pattern of rrna modifications as well as the set of snornas guiding these modifications are conserved in vertebrates  <cit> .

the data obtained by zhang et al. can be interpreted in the following way. the efficiency of northern hybridization is well known to decrease when a probe contains regions not complementary to the target. sequence identity between snorna homologs from different vertebrate species ranges from ~ <dig> to ~90%. taxonomically close species have more similar snorna homologs. at the same time, different snornas have different similarity levels . accordingly, a hybridization probe for a rhesus snorna does not necessarily allow the detection of this snorna homologs in other vertebrate species. for instance, we failed to detect snord <dig> rna in birds using a probe for rat snord <dig>  although it readily detected the homologs in different mammals . this explains why zhang et al. could detect only six chicken snornas using rhesus snorna sequences as probes . they claim that  <dig> out of  <dig> snornas studied are not expressed in chicken; however,  <dig> of them have been identified by other researchers  <cit>  by cdna cloning . moreover, zhang et al. reported many snorna species as not expressed in chicken  <cit>  but had previously cloned them from chicken  <cit>  .

the failure to detect snorna expression in human and mouse can be explained similarly. as one would expect, the closer genomic sequences, the more snornas can be detected. rhesus snorna probes detected more snornas in human than in mouse, and more snornas in mouse than in chicken . note that some snornas whose expression was not detected in mouse  had been described before   <cit> . due to the same reasons, the attempt of zhang et al. to detect snornas that were not detected in muscle, in other human and mouse tissues also failed since the same rhesus probes were used.

the cases when snorna expression was not detected in human look particularly odd considering that all these snornas have been initially described in human . moreover, the names specified, snora and snord, correspond to the new nomenclature specifically designed for human snornas  <cit> , a fact that alone indicates their expression in human. thus, the lineage-specific and species-specific expression patterns of rhesus snornas reported by zhang et al. are experimental artifacts.

identification of species-specific ncrnas in chicken results from improper use of northern hybridization
a similar mistake was made by zhang et al. in their publication describing chicken snornas  <cit> . they cloned  <dig> chicken ncrnas, mainly snornas, and attempted to detect these rnas in chicken, mouse, and human tissues by northern hybridization. similarly to the results discussed above, positive signal was largely observed in chicken only.

zhang et al. detected the same snornas in chicken but not in human and mouse  <cit> ; and later, in rhesus, human, and/or mouse but not in chicken  <cit> . each time species-specific expression of these snornas was alleged. examples of such detection experiments are given in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

novel chicken ncrnas are homologs of known human ncrnas
zhang et al. reported  <dig> new ncrnas in chicken  <cit> . they claimed that these rnas  can be detected by northern hybridization only in chicken, and genes for most of them  are absent in the genomes of other vertebrates. table  <dig> demonstrates that  <dig> out of  <dig> so-called "novel" rnas are homologs of previously described human small rnas,  <dig> of which are snornas. in each case, a snorna shares the antisense element with a human homolog . most of these allegedly new chicken rnas can be identified by the search systems of the rfam database of ncrnas  <cit>  and the snornabase of human nucleolar rnas  <cit>  . moreover, a good fraction of these "novel" chicken rnas had been cloned by shao et al.  <cit> , and this fact was acknowledged by zhang et al. . shao et al. managed to identify these rnas as human snorna homologs, while zhang et al. presented them as new rnas. thus, most novel ncrnas described by zhang et al. in chicken are homologs of well-known human ncrnas.

 <dig> according to zhang et al.  <cit> ;listed in the same order as in table one in  <cit> .

 <dig> the snord102b transcript has a longer antisense element than snord102a, and thus can guide the modification the rrna nucleotide adjacent to that guided by snord102a  <cit> .

 <dig> net <dig> rna is described by us  <cit>  and is specific for vertebrates except placental mammals.

too long antisense elements and wrong target site predictions
zhang et al. presented sequences of the c/d snornas cloned from rhesus monkey and identified the whole fragments between c and d' boxes, as well as between c' and d boxes as the antisense elements . however, it is known that an antisense element  is not a snorna fragment between the conserved boxes but rather a specific fragment complementary to the target rna. in most cases it is not long, usually from  <dig> to  <dig> nt  <cit> , which is much shorter than the fragments specified by zhang et al.

zhang et al. performed a computer search for the targets of rhesus c/d snornas . however, the targets for these snornas were identified long ago, and the methylation of most of them was demonstrated  <cit> . for instance, snord <dig> rna can guide modification of g- <dig> in 28s rrna, and this nucleotide is actually 2'-o-methylated  <cit>  . with a few exceptions, the targets identified by zhang et al. do not correspond to the confirmed ones. for example, the nucleotide in rhesus u <dig> rna putatively modified by snord <dig> rnp is not methylated in human rna  <cit>  and, considering the conserved pattern of rna modifications, is almost surely unmethylated in rhesus monkey . zhang et al. identified methylation targets in 5s rrna, whereas it has no 2'-o-methylated nucleotides in eukaryotes  <cit> . in addition, due to a small size of antisense elements, hundreds of potential targets can be proposed; and presenting some of them without experimental verification of their methylation status is unsubstantiated.

it was shown that a modified base is located four nucleotides upstream of the d/d' box in the c/d snorna/target rna duplex  <cit> . in many cases presented by zhang et al., e.g., in the putative snord <dig> target in ssu rrna , a complementary sequence is more than four nucleotides away from the d/d' box, which makes the modification of these putative target rnas by the proposed snornas impossible.

numbers of snornas and their gene copies in non-mammalian species is substantially underestimated
zhang et al. stated that the numbers of snornas and their genes increase from fish, amphibians, and birds to mammals  <cit> . instead of a search for the new snorna genes, they used ensembl annotations based on the rfam database  <cit> . identification of homologs of the experimentally detected ncrnas is much more complex compared to protein homologs due to their low sequence similarity. in the case of snornas, the conserved elements  comprise a half of the sequence length at most. the similarity level in non-conserved sequences varies between vertebrates and is usually low . in addition, snorna genes in different species can be located within different introns of the same host gene or within different host genes. thereby, many snorna genes are missing from lists created by annotation programs.

our study on the numbers of c/d snornas and their genes in representatives of different vertebrate classes  <cit>  yielded results contrary to those obtained by zhang et al.  <cit> . instead of using automatic annotations, we searched for each c/d snorna in the vertebrate genomes using the wu blast  <dig>  algorithm with specifically selected relaxed parameters; and the results of each search were manually inspected  <cit> . the data obtained and supplemented in this work  did not reveal any significant increase in the number of c/d snornas in mammals, as compared to other vertebrates. we found that most human snornas have homologs in other vertebrate classes. moreover, our data demonstrated a trend towards low copy numbers of c/d snorna genes in placental mammals. for instance, snord <dig> rna is encoded by four genes in xenopus and zebrafish each; two genes, in chicken; and by a single gene in human.
1targets are unknown for snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  and snord <dig>  records snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  and snord <dig> were deleted from the ncbi nucleotide database. snord <dig> is an isoform of snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  snord <dig>  and snord <dig> guide no modifications.



zhang et al. failed to find many snorna genes in vertebrates. figure  <dig> lists snorna genes identified by zhang et al.  and missed by them but identified by other researchers ). the latter portion also includes snornas cloned by zhang et al. from chicken  <cit>  . a plus sign in figure  <dig> indicates genes present in the new release of rfam , which shows how severely the conclusions by zhang et al. depend on the rfam release used. however, this release still does not contain many snorna genes identified in specific snorna studies . this particularly applies to the c/d rna genes described by us . thus, studies specifically designed for a search of a particular group of ncrnas in the whole genomes give much better results than the use of databases with automatically annotated ncrnas.

in contrast to the consecutive increase in the number of snornas from fish to mammals alleged by zhang et al., we found that most mammalian c/d snorna genes have homologs in the genomes of other vertebrate classes . this is not surprising considering that most snornas are involved in rrna modifications, and that the pattern of rrna 2'-o-methylation and, likely, pseudouridylation is rather conserved in vertebrates  <cit> . the cases when some snorna gene is not found in a particular species can be attributed to the gaps in the genome sequences . a minor fraction of snorna genes can be missing in some vertebrate classes considering some variations in the pattern of rrna modifications between vertebrates. for instance, differential rrna 2'-o-methylation between human and frog is observed in  <dig> out of ~ <dig> sites  <cit> . it is of interest that about a half of missing snorna genes is observed in fishes , which can point to a specific pattern of their rrna methylation relative to other vertebrate classes.

number of mammalian snorna genes is substantially overstated
zhang et al. stated that the number of snorna genes steadily increases in the series from fish to mammals, and that there is a burst in their number in mammals  <cit> . again, ensembl annotations based on the rfam database were used rather than their own data. for each ncrna, rfam specifies all homologs in different species without specifying if a particular sequence is a gene or a pseudogene. this problem requires detailed examination of both the proper sequence and its genomic environment which is not covered by rfam. accordingly, rfam records do not necessarily represent ncrna genes, but may represent their pseudogenes as well, and this is clearly indicated in the help section of the database  <cit> . however, zhang et al. considered all corresponding rfam and ensembl entries as snorna genes: they reported the identification of  <dig> snorna genes in rhesus monkey,  <dig> genes in mouse, more than  <dig> genes in human, and ~ <dig> genes in platypus. the problem of snorna gene copy numbers in mammals is discussed in several publications by different groups . all these data agree with each other, as well as with our data  <cit> : while the number of known mammalian snornas is about  <dig>  the total number of their genes does not exceed ~ <dig> . this is substantially less than proposed by zhang et al. most mammalian-specific snorna genes found by them reside in intergenic regions rather than in introns. it is generally accepted that nearly all snorna genes of vertebrates are localized in introns of host genes, and only snord <dig> , snord <dig> , snord <dig> , scarna <dig>  and scarna <dig> are transcribed from their own promoters. it has been well documented that expression of the intronic snornas requires transcription of the host genes . that is why any sequence similar to an intronic snorna gene outside of introns is most likely a nonfunctional pseudogene. only full-length copies with intact conserved regions and specific secondary structure can be considered as putative snorna genes. in addition, a search for a host gene, which may remain unannotated, should be done. zhang et al. made no such analysis for the intergenic sequences annotated by ensembl as snorna genes. screening the human genome for snorna-like sequences revealed that most of them proved to be nonfunctional retrogenes with substitutions in the conserved regions  <cit> . clearly, zhang et al. considered such pseudogenes as snorna genes. we have demonstrated that the number of c/d snorna pseudogenes is much higher in mammals than in other vertebrates  <cit> . therefore, the burst in mammalian snorna gene numbers alleged by zhang et al. most likely represents the burst in the number of their pseudogenes.

thus, zhang et al. overestimated the number of snorna genes in mammals but underestimated the numbers of snornas and their genes in other vertebrates. this led to a false conclusion that the numbers of snornas and their genes increase in the series from fish to mammals.

are intronic snorna genes indeed transcribed from their own promoters?
snorna pseudogenes with intact conserved regions could, in theory, be functional even when located outside of host gene introns, i.e. in intergenic regions. for that to happen, they should possess their own promoters that would allow independent transcription. li et al. attempted to find such promoters for intergenic snorna-like sequences as well as independent promoters for snorna genes located within introns of the host genes  <cit> . they selected  <dig> putative human snorna genes,  <dig> of which were located in intergenic regions. this is much a higher number than the generally accepted estimate of the number of snorna genes . again, li et al. used ensembl annotations, thus, combining snorna genes and pseudogenes. the search for snorna promoters using the coreboost_hm program  <cit>  identified them in  <dig> out of  <dig> loci:  <dig> intronic loci and  <dig> intergenic ones .

based on these results, li et al. proposed five models of snorna transcription. the first model assumes that transcription of a snorna and a host gene occurs from a common promoter and is generally accepted. this model describes most of the snornas studied. other models assume that transcription of a snorna gene occurs from an independent promoter.

the second model suggests an intronic snorna gene with its own promoter independent of a host gene promoter. this model was exemplified by one of snord <dig>  genes located in an intron of the tex <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> . however, it is well known that snord <dig> always possesses its own promoter and requires no host gene for its transcription. therefore, snord <dig> can not be used as an illustration of the proposed model. moreover, the sequence on chromosome  <dig> has numerous substitutions in the functional regions and, hence, is a nonfunctional snord <dig> pseudogene .

the other three models describe snorna genes located outside of host genes and putatively transcribed from their own promoters. however, the snora <dig> gene located on the plus strand of chromosome  <dig> and used for illustrating the third model  is actually a pseudogene with missing 5'-terminus . models iv and v are presented in figure  <dig>  one can see that the snorna genes are within introns of overlooked host genes rather than within intergenic regions. thus, the promoters identified by li et al. as snorna promoters are, in fact, host gene promoters.

other genes identified by li et al. as independently transcribed snorna genes are presented in additional file  <dig>  in each case, there is either an unnoticed host gene harboring snorna genes in its introns or a snorna pseudogene with substitutions questioning its functionality. a few exceptions are snora26-like sequence with intact functional regions and seven snord <dig> genes. however, there are no ests confirming independent transcription of these genes, whereas for all independently transcribed human snornas ests marking their transcription can be found.

thus, all examples of snorna independent transcription presented by li et al.  are inadequate.

discussion
how many snorna genes are there?
studies by zhu and coworkers attracted our attention since their results were at variance with our data. the main contradiction was the estimated number of snorna genes in vertebrates. our estimation of the number of mammalian c/d snorna genes  <cit>  agrees with the data obtained by other groups: the total number of mammalian snorna genes known to date does not exceed ~ <dig> . in addition, we have shown a lower number of c/d snorna genes guiding rrna modifications in mammals relative to other vertebrate classes  <cit> . conversely, zhang et al. stated that the number of mammalian snorna genes sharply increased to ~ <dig> compared to other vertebrate classes  <cit> . here we demonstrated inadequacy of their techniques, which invalidates their conclusions. in particular, they considered numerous pseudogenes as snorna genes in mammals and failed to detect many snorna genes in other vertebrate classes.

northern hybridization has its limitations when used for detection of homologous ncrnas in vertebrates
possible existence of species-specific ncrnas is extremely interesting, and it is being explored by many groups. zhang et al. reported numerous lineage-specific and species-specific snornas in chicken  <cit>  and in rhesus monkey  <cit> . here we demonstrated that their conclusions were based on a systemic error: zhang et al. detected snorna homologs in vertebrate species using a probe for snorna of another vertebrate species, while the sequence identity of such homologs can go below 60% . under these conditions, standard northern hybridization technique can not be used for homologs detection.

using automatically generated ncrna databases alone can lead to erroneous 
CONCLUSIONS
while application of genomic and est sequence collections has become routine in bioinformatic studies, using automatic annotations of genes, especially ncrna genes, requires great caution. for instance, ensembl ncrna annotations based on the rfam data are excellent landmarks for genome researchers. however, the rates of false positives and missed genes in these annotations, at least in snorna annotations, make their application unacceptable for studies specifically designed to identify new ncrna genes. for example, rfam makes no distinction between snorna genes and pseudogenes, but zhang et al. considered all annotated snorna sequences as snorna genes, which led them to erroneous conclusions  <cit> . in addition, existing automatically generated databases still do not include all ncrna homologs in different species. therefore, special studies are needed to prevent underestimation of ncrna number. e.g., rfam lacks many snorna sequences presented here  or available in the snornabase  <cit> . zhang et al. made no attempt to overcome this problem, and, as a result, missed many snorna genes in different vertebrates. thus, relying only on automatic annotations can lead to erroneous conclusions. actually, most researchers pursue their own way through the genomic thicket to succeed in snorna studies  <cit> .

we especially focused on this issue since at least one more publication reported questionable conclusions concerning vertebrate snornas based on the rfam and ensembl annotations as well as multispecies whole-genome alignments  <cit> . again, the fact that snorna genes and pseudogenes are not distinguished in the rfam entries was not taken into account.

names of snorna homologs need unification
lots of snornas have been described in different vertebrates to date, which necessitates the unification of their nomenclature. zhang et al. gave a new name to each chicken homolog of human snorna  <cit> . this practice is not exclusive to zhang et al. but is common in almost all publications describing snornas in vertebrates apart from human. this was justified during the period of time when novel snornas rather than homologs of known ones were being identified . presently, a convenient nomenclature has been developed for human snornas  <cit> , and identification of novel snornas has become extremely rare. in this context, giving new names to snornas, whose homologs have been identified in other vertebrates, is highly confusing. it gives an erroneous impression that novel snornas have actually been found and confuses the overall picture. for instance, a special investigation should be conducted to understand that the gggcd37b snorna identified in chicken by shao et al.  <cit>  corresponds to ggn <dig> found by zhang et al. in chicken, too  <cit> , and is a homolog of human snord <dig>  the analysis of the whole set of data presented in these papers becomes hardly practicable. finally, it is very hard to recognize the rare cases of a truly novel rna identification. a positive practice in the field can be exemplified by the rfam database specifying all homologs of human snornas by the human rna name. since new publications describing snornas in vertebrates can be expected, we propose to develop a nomenclature convention for the homologs. the human snorna names can be used with prefixes denoting the vertebrate species, e.g., mmussnord <dig> for the mouse homolog of human snord <dig>  we propose to use four-letter prefixes to distinguish species such as mus musculus  and microcebus murinus .

independent transcription of snorna genes is an intriguing possibility, but it needs strong support
recent data indicate that many mirna genes located within introns of host genes have their own promoters  <cit> . this interesting and unexpected finding inspires one to test a similar pattern in snornas, nearly all of which are encoded within introns in vertebrates. noteworthily, no experimental data supporting the hypothesis of intronic snornas transcription from their own promoters are available to date. at the same time, their transcription within the host gene pre-mrna from the host gene promoter has been well documented dozens of times . thus, the idea of transcription of intronic snornas from their own promoters is at variance with our current knowledge about their expression, and identification of such promoters should have solid experimental support. preliminary bioinformatic analysis can be beneficial, but it should be adequate and thorough, which was not the case with li et al.  <cit> .

erroneous data begin to shape our view of ncrnas
currently, discovery of the species-specific ncrnas is generally anticipated that may lead to less critical peer reviewing of publications reporting such rnas. here we show that the result can be harmful to the field. even more importantly, such publications began to misshape our understanding of ncrnas: one of the papers criticized here  <cit>  has already been cited in a recent review  <cit> .

vertebrate genomes may actually contain many not yet identified snornas. this idea is supported by the data from several groups  <cit> . however, publications like the ones considered here only add confusion to the problem rather than contribute to the solution. thus, it is very important to prevent a false start in this exciting field.
