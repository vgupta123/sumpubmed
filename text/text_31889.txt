BACKGROUND
riboflavin  is a direct precursor to the cofactors flavin mononucleotide  and flavin adenine dinucleotide . riboflavin is synthesized by plants and many microorganisms; it is not synthesized by animals  <cit> . many gram-positive bacteria seem to be capable of acquiring riboflavin from the environment, whereas most gram-negative bacteria depend on the endogenous synthesis of this vitamin  <cit> . riboflavin transporters  have been identified and characterized in b. subtilis  <cit> , in lactococcus lactis  <cit>  and in a few other bacteria. three classes of riboflavin transporters seem to exist:  homologs of ribu of b. subtilis,  homologs of ribm of corynebacterium glutamicum and  homologs of impx of fusobacterium nucleatum  <cit> . the latter class has not been functionally characterized  <cit> . b. subtilis ribu is part of a modular multi-subunit riboflavin transporter and belongs to the recently identified family of energy-coupling factor  transporters  <cit> . l. lactis ribu  <cit>  has also been included in the latter classification, the driving force behind transport activity was shown to be atp hydrolysis  <cit> . notably, ribu of staphylococcus aureus has been crystallized and its three-dimensional structure has been determined  <cit> . b. subtilis ribu is a proton-riboflavin symporter with high affinity for its substrate   <cit> . ribu is strikingly different from the corynebacterium glutamicum riboflavin transporter ribm, which was characterized as an energy-independent facilitator for riboflavin with much lower affinity   <cit> . ribm from c. glutamicum is similar  to ribm  from s. davawensis. the gene for the latter protein is present in the s. davawensis riboflavin biosynthetic gene cluster ribbmah which is controlled by an fmn riboswitch  <cit>  directly upstream of ribb  <cit> . s. davawensis is the only known producer of the riboflavin analog roseoflavin, which has antibiotic activity  <cit> . highly similar  ribm proteins  are present in other species of the genus streptomyces. the gene for the flavin facilitator ribm from s. davawensis was codon optimized for expression in b. subtilis. the gene ribm was functionally characterized and was found to encode a transporter for riboflavin and roseoflavin. finally, ribm was evaluated as a possible tool to enhance the productivity of a b. subtilis riboflavin production strain.

RESULTS
expression of ribm from s. davawensis in e. coli increased riboflavin uptake
the wild-type gene ribm from s. davawensis was expressed in e. coli using the plasmid pnco113ribm, employing an iptg controlled t <dig> promotor  <cit> . e. coli does not contain an endogenous uptake system for flavins  <cit> . riboflavin import was monitored using riboflavin. it was found that expression of ribm resulted in a significant increase in the cellular radioactivity shortly after adding the labelled substrate  strongly suggesting that ribm codes for a functional flavin transporter. the uptake activity was  <dig>  pmol riboflavin × od cells- <dig> min- <dig> in the ribm expressing strain. the control strain  showed an uptake activity of  <dig>  pmol riboflavin × od cells- <dig> min- <dig>  riboflavin uptake mediated by s. davawensis ribm was only slightly affected by fad and the protonophore cccp . roseoflavin, fmn and a 10-fold excess of unlabelled riboflavin apparently reduced riboflavin uptake suggesting that roseoflavin and fmn are substrates for ribm. similar results were generated in our previous study analysing ribm from c. glutamicum  <cit> , where it was additionally shown that riboflavin uptake was not affected by the absence of glucose or the addition of sodium azide. in summary, we conclude that ribm from s. davawensis is a transporter for riboflavin and roseoflavin, and that transport appears to occur independently of metabolic energy.

introduction of ribm from s. davawensis in b. subtilis
the ribm gene from s. davawensis has a relatively high g+c-content  and was optimized with respect to the codon usage of b. subtilis in order to allow efficient heterologous expression. the artificial gene was named ribmopt and was inserted into the expression vector pht <dig> to give pht01ribmopt. expression using pht <dig> is based on the strong σa-dependent promoter  preceding the groe operon of b. subtilis which has been converted into an efficiently controllable  promoter by addition of the lac operator from e. coli. a b. subtilis wild-type strain  and a riboflavin overproducing b. subtilis strain  were transformed with pht01ribmopt. from the resulting strains, b. subtilis  <dig> < pht01ribmopt > and bshp < pht01ribmopt > plasmids were isolated. dna sequencing revealed the presence of the ribmopt gene under control of pgrac in all strains.

the gene ribmopt from s. davawensis was functionally expressed in b. subtilis
b. subtilis  <dig> < pht01ribmopt > and b. subtilis  <dig> < pht <dig> >  were grown to the exponential growth phase in lb and treated with iptg . cells were harvested at different time points after induction  and total rna was prepared. northern blot analysis using a ribmopt specific oligonucleotide probe revealed, that the heterologous gene ribmopt was expressed in b. subtilis  <dig> < pht01ribmopt > . the  <dig>  kb transcript was found in iptg treated cells only. the strongest signal was observed  <dig> h after induction . in this lane an additional band at  <dig>  kb appeared, possibly formed by aggregates of not fully denatured ribmopt transcripts. the data showed that the ribmopt transcript was present even  <dig> h after induction . subsequently, cytoplasmic fractions and membrane fractions of cell-free extracts of b. subtilis  <dig> < pht01ribmopt > and b. subtilis  <dig> < pht <dig> >  were subjected to western blot analysis. the synthesis of his6-tagged ribm was monitored using anti-penta-his antibodies . his6-tagged ribm was found in the membrane fraction of iptg  treated b. subtilis  <dig> < pht01ribmopt > only, indicating that ribm was directed to the membranes . the addition of higher amounts of iptg  did not enhance the amount of heterologous ribm in recombinant b. subtilis strains . thus , in the following experiments, stimulation of ribm synthesis in b. subtilis routinely was carried out using  <dig> μm iptg.

synthesis of ribm in b. subtilis mutants supported growth and enhanced roseoflavin sensitivity
in the following experiment the b. subtilis double mutant Δribb::ermr  Δribu::kanr  was used. this strain carries deletions in ribb, encoding riboflavin synthase  catalyzing the last step of riboflavin biosynthesis  <cit> , and in ribu, the energy-dependent riboflavin transporter  <cit> . the double mutant was transformed with pht01ribmopt or the empty plasmid and both transformants were compared in growth assays on lb plates. only the strains transformed with pht01ribmopt could grow on lb, which contains about  <dig>  μm riboflavin, or on lb supplemented with   <dig>  μm riboflavin or  <dig> μm riboflavin . upon addition of  <dig> μm riboflavin both transformants could grow. growth of the control strain, however, was reduced. at  <dig> μm riboflavin no difference in growth was observed indicating that at this concentration the vitamin crosses the cytoplasmic membrane independently of a dedicated transport system. similar experiments were performed in liquid spizizen minimal media containing glucose or sucrose  and  <dig> μm riboflavin in the presence or absence of the inducer iptg. in all experiments, only the pht01ribmopt containing strains were able to grow . we conclude from these experiments that ribm was responsible for flavin transport, giving further evidence that ribm from s. davawensis is a functional transporter in b. subtilis.

the mutant strain Δribu::kanr  was transformed with pht01ribmopt and tested with respect to roseoflavin sensitivity on lb plates containing  <dig> μm iptg . roseoflavin is a toxic riboflavin analog. clearly, the presence of ribm enhanced roseoflavin transport and thus roseoflavin sensitivity of Δribu::kanr < pht01ribmopt > at  <dig> μm roseoflavin. the addition of >  <dig> μm roseoflavin reduced growth of the Δribu::kanr control strain containing empty pht <dig>  indicating that the flavin  is able to permeate over the cytoplasmic membrane without catalysis mediated by a facilitator. similar experiments were carried out using liquid lb cultures. b. subtilis Δribu::kanr containing pht01ribmopt was grown in the presence of the inducer iptg and different concentrations of roseoflavin . in lb broth, the effect of ribmopt was most obvious at  <dig> μm roseoflavin where the ribmopt containing strain grew to od <dig> of about  <dig>  and the strain containing the empty vector grew to od <dig> of  <dig> . a higher concentration of roseoflavin  inhibited growth of both strains, pointing towards a transporter independent diffusion of roseoflavin .

ribm enhanced riboflavin production in a high performance b. subtilis production strain
the high-performance riboflavin production strain bshp, which produces about  <dig> mg/l riboflavin, was transformed with pht01ribmopt and pht <dig>  two transformant bshp strains containing pht01ribmopt  and four transformant strains containing pht <dig>  were isolated and grown in shake flasks in a medium routinely used for the analysis of the performance of industrial riboflavin production strains. for each strain three different flasks were inoculated and analyzed . the cells were treated with iptg in order to control synthesis of ribm. the final cell densities of all cultures were very similar . at the end of fermentation residual sugar was determined. in all cultures the carbon source was completely metabolized. the total amount of riboflavin   in the cultures was measured . at  <dig> μm iptg the riboflavin concentration was similar in cultures of the pht01ribmopt containing strains ribm <dig> and ribm <dig> when compared to the control pht <dig> . similar results were obtained at  <dig> μm iptg. at  <dig> μm iptg and at  <dig> mm iptg, however, a significant increase at the 5% level of significance was found. the data revealed that the differences in productivity were 11%  and 18% . the latter values were determined by comparing the average amount of riboflavin synthesized by ribm <dig> and ribm <dig> to the amount produced by the control. surprisingly, at  <dig> mm iptg the amount of riboflavin in cultures of the control strain containing the empty plasmid pht <dig> was significantly lower as compared to the values obtained at  <dig> μm iptg,  <dig> μm iptg and  <dig> μm iptg. we do not have an explanation for this. as mentioned above, the control experiment was done with four different independent transformant strains with similar results. it is known that reduced growth positively affects the accumulation of metabolites. growth, however, was very similar in all cultures  and therefore a growth limitation cannot explain the apparent increase of the riboflavin synthesis. all in all our data suggest that the presence of ribm enhanced riboflavin production under these experimental conditions.

discussion
our results suggest that ribm from s. davawensis mediates flavin  translocation via an energy independent facilitated diffusion mechanism. the probable physiological role of ribm is the acquirement of riboflavin from the environment. the genes ribbmah from s. davawensis form a transcription unit and are expressed only when riboflavin is limiting in the growth medium  <cit> . the genes ribb , riba  and ribh  are responsible for riboflavin biosynthesis. the fact that ribm is cotranscribed with the genes ribb, riba and ribh suggests that a transporter is produced in parallel to the riboflavin biosynthetic enzymes. this appears not to be economical. if no riboflavin is present in the cytoplasm, the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes must be synthesized. the coproduction of a riboflavin transporter, however, is reasonable only when external riboflavin indeed is present. in turn, if riboflavin is present in the growth medium, the production of biosynthetic enzymes apparently constitutes a waste of metabolic energy. notably, in the streptomycetes s. avermitilis, s. coelicolor, s. scabiei and s. griseus ribbmah clusters  are present as well. it seems that streptomycetes play it safe with respect to riboflavin supply. if riboflavin is growth limiting, proteins for transport and biosynthesis are synthesized in parallel to ensure availability of the vitamin.

the transport activity and direction of an energy independent facilitator depends on the concentration of the metabolite in the cytoplasm and the surrounding medium, respectively. thus, ribm in principle may also confer roseoflavin resistance to s. davawensis , which naturally produces this antibiotic in the stationary growth phase. the export activity of ribm  in principle may also be of importance with respect to metabolic engineering of riboflavin production strains. in order to test this idea, ribm was functionally expressed in a production strain of b. subtilis, an organism, which is used for the commercial production of riboflavin  <cit> . the introduction of ribm into a high performance b. subtilis riboflavin production strain apparently improved riboflavin production. although the increase was relatively small, for a large scale production process the improvement may be relevant. we suggest that the export activity of ribm leads to reduced levels of riboflavin in the cytoplasm possibly enhancing the carbon flux through the pathway. this may enhance productivity during the exponential growth phase  or during stationary growth . wild-type b. subtilis cells rapidly and almost quantitatively convert intracellular riboflavin to fmn and fad  <cit> , a reaction, which is catalyzed by the bifunctional flavokinase/fad synthetase ribc. all production strains have a strongly reduced ribc activity   <cit> . thus, production strains contain unusually high amounts of free riboflavin, which, in principle, might reduce the activity of the riboflavin biosynthetic enzymes.

the introduction of a protein catalyzing riboflavin export may also improve current production processes employing other microorganisms such as ashbya gossypii or candida famata  <cit> . for a. gossypii interesting physiological studies suggest riboflavin export across the plasma membrane  <cit> . to our knowledge the corresponding exporter has not yet been identified.

successful examples for strain optimization on the basis of metabolite export  have been reported for corynebacterium glutamicum  <cit> . our work is the first to use a similar approach for optimizing one of the most successful biotechnological processes, the commercial synthesis of riboflavin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the gene ribm from s. davawensis encodes a membrane protein which is able to catalyze the uptake of riboflavin but also of the antibiotic roseoflavin, a structural riboflavin analog. the functional expression of ribm in e. coli and b. subtilis apparently was possible without the cosynthesis of other protein components. furthermore, our previous  <cit>  and our present data data suggest that ribm proteins are energy independent flavin facilitators. consequently, s. davawensis ribm could in principle also catalyze riboflavin export and be useful to increase the riboflavin yield in a riboflavin production process. most riboflavin currently is produced using genetically engineered microorganisms, whereby b. subtilis is an important host. classic random mutagenesis and methods of metabolic engineering have been used in order to optimize b. subtilis for the production of riboflavin. most effort was directed at impairment of regulation of the riboflavin biosynthetic operon and amplification of the copy number of the structural genes ribgbah  <cit> . however, import of substrates and export of the product have not yet been considered as strategies for further improvement. in order to partially fill this gap, we introduced ribm into a high-performance b. subtilis riboflavin production strain. we could show that the gene was actively transcribed and that the gene product ribm was directed to the cytoplasmic membrane. shake flask experiments routinely used to evaluate the performance of riboflavin overproducing strains suggest that upon induction with  <dig> μm iptg, the amount of riboflavin at the end of growth indeed is higher as compared to the controls. possibly, riboflavin transporters from other microorganisms may even be more useful and may show even better results.
