BACKGROUND
the thyroid gland is a very important organ for the development of vertebrates as it synthesizes hormones that are essential for growth, development and survival such as tetraiodothyronine  and triodothyronine . thyroglobulin , thyroperoxidase , sodium/iodide symporter , and tsh receptor  are genes necessary for the synthesis of such hormones which takes place in the fully differentiated thyroid cell, called the thyrocite  <cit> . indeed, some of these genes mark a differentiated thyroid cell; in particular, thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase are genes exclusively expressed in thyroid cells. the promoters of these two genes have been extensively studied and three transcription factors, namely ttf- <dig> , foxe <dig> and pax <dig>  have been demonstrated to be involved in the activation of these genes  <cit> . during development and in the adult life, these factors are also present in other tissues, but the three of them are co-expressed only in the thyroid. it has been shown that their expression is required for the early stages of thyroid morphogenesis and is crucial for normal thyroid function. indeed, for all its life a thyroid cell will be hallmarked by the simultaneous presence of ttf- <dig>  foxe <dig> and pax <dig>  interestingly, these thyroid-enriched transcription factors are likely linked in a regulatory network such that each of them can be involved in the initiation or maintenance of the others  <cit> .

during the past years, the role of pax <dig> in the fully developed thyroid gland was studied in depth and it was established that pax <dig> plays a key role in thyroid development and differentiation  <cit> . the first evidence of a role for pax <dig> in the fully developed thyroid gland was provided by mansouri et al.  <cit>  by the generation of a pax <dig> knockout mouse. interestingly, pax8+/- mice had no phenotype, while homozygous pax8-/- mice showed growth retardation and died within 2- <dig> weeks. the cause of the death of the mutated animals was hypothyroidism, and the administration of thyroxine to pax8-/- mice allowed the animals to survive. in fact, these mice did not display any apparent defects in pax <dig> territories of expression except for the thyroid gland that appeared smaller and no follicles were detectable, demonstrating that pax <dig> is necessary for the survival of follicular thyroid cells. furthermore, it was shown that in the thyroid anlage of pax8-/- mice the expression of foxe <dig> is strongly down-regulated  <cit> . these observations demonstrated that pax <dig> not only is required for the survival of thyroid precursor cells, but also holds a specific upper role in the genetic regulatory cascade, which controls thyroid development and its functional differentiation.

indeed, the reintroduction in vitro of an exogenous pax <dig> in the pcpy transformed thyroid cell line, in which pax <dig> is absent as well as all the differentiation markers, was sufficient to re-activate transcription of the endogenous genes encoding thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase and sodium/iodide symporter  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that pax <dig>  together and synergistically with another thyroid-enriched transcription factor ttf- <dig>  is able to activate transcription from the thyroglobulin gene promoter  <cit> .

although the function as well as the downstream targets of pax <dig> are well studied, very little is known about its transcriptional regulation. actually, an exhaustive knowledge of such a regulation is essential for a comprehensive view of thyroid gland development and differentiation pathways. understanding those pathways is important not only to develop new treatments for thyroid gland diseases but also to add new dowels in the understanding of gene deregulation-dependent syndromes.

therefore, the aim of this work was to shed light on the transcriptional regulation of pax <dig> gene expression. the identification of distant acting gene regulatory sequences that direct precise spatial and temporal patterns of expression has been limited, despite their established roles in development, phenotypic diversity and human disease. comparative genomic-based approaches have proved to be useful in identifying gene regulatory sequences, primarily on a gene-by-gene basis. these studies involved sequence comparisons of human  genomic intervals to orthologous regions from organisms separated by varying evolutionary distances, ranging from primates to fish  <cit> .

we decided to use the bioinformatics approach to search for putative enhancer elements located in the 5'-flanking region of pax <dig>  we utilized a common interspecies sequence comparison and we analyzed  <dig> kb of orthologous regions of the human and mouse pax <dig> gene. the rationale for using cross-species sequence comparisons to identify biologically active regions of a genome is based on the observation that sequences with important functions are frequently conserved among phylogenetically distant species, distinguishing them from non-functional surrounding sequences. we searched for non-coding genomic sequences , conserved between human and mouse, located in the 5'-flanking region of the pax <dig> chromosomic locus, and we identified one sequence with a high thyroid-specific transcriptional activity. we demonstrated that this sequence is the first discovered enhancer of the pax <dig> gene.

RESULTS
genomic comparison and identification of conserved non-coding sequences
using the program vista, we compared  <dig> kb of orthologous regions of the human and mouse pax <dig> gene searching for conserved non-coding sequences . the first known gene at the 3'-end and the first known gene at 5'-end of the pax <dig> gene were taken as border limits of the genomic fragment selected. we considered sequences as conserved if they aligned without a gap for ≥ <dig> bp and have ≥70% nucleotide identity. in figure  <dig>  the percentages of identical nucleotides are visualized as a peak along the sequence of the base organism . all peaks that cover pieces of sequences sharing more than 50% of similarity are drawn, and those corresponding to the settings described above are highlighted in pink. as confirmation, we used in parallel to the global comparison program vista, the local comparison program pipmaker. the results of these two programs were completely overlapping, retrieving the same conserved sequences .

 <dig> cns fitting the above-cited criteria were identified. we discarded  <dig> of them because of their overlap with coding sequences inside the pax <dig> gene  and the remaining  <dig> were defined as non-coding conserved elements. we decided to focus our attention on  <dig> segments in the 5'-flanking region of the pax <dig> gene extending for  <dig> kb upstream the start of transcription and located more than  <dig> kb away from any known gene.

to investigate the potential biological activity of these conserved regions, promoter-reporter assays were performed. to this end, each cns was amplified by pcr on mouse genomic dna and chimeric constructs were generated inserting each fragment in the pgl3-basic reporter vector containing the e1b minimal promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase. we then analyzed the ability of the  <dig> selected cns to act as enhancer in the immortalized thyroid cell line pc cl <dig>  cells were transiently transfected with the cns-constructs together with an internal control plasmid  to normalize for transfection efficiency. figure 2a summarizes the transcriptional activity of each construct as fold induction over the transcription obtained with the e1b-pgl3-basic vector. first we noticed that, out of  <dig> cns tested, only  <dig> showed transcriptional activity. among these, the cns <dig> and cns <dig> showed the highest activity, with  <dig> and  <dig> fold increase respectively, over the basal level of the empty vector containing only the e1b basal promoter. based on its position, coincident with the start of transcription, we hypothesized that the cns <dig> could be a putative promoter and its analysis was conducted separately. for the continuation of the study we decided to characterize in better depth only the most active,  <dig> bp long cns <dig>  located  <dig>  kb upstream of the pax <dig> 5'utr .

interestingly, the cns <dig> manifested a very high transcriptional activity in the thyroid cell line pc cl <dig>  but it showed no activity in hela cells . similar results were obtained if the cns <dig> was inserted in a reporter vector containing the minimal promoter of the thymidine-kinase gene . we conclude that the cns <dig> is an enhancer with thyroid-specific transcriptional activity.

the thyroid-specific transcription factor ttf- <dig> binds to the cns87
we performed dnase-i footprinting analysis using nuclear extracts prepared from pc cl <dig> with 32p-5'end-labeled cns <dig> and we observed six protected regions  . to further characterize proteins binding on each ft, we performed electromobility shift assays  using  <dig> nt long oligonucleotides designed on each of the six fts that were incubated with either thyroid  or non-thyroid  protein extracts . while oligonucleotides derived from ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> showed similar retarded bands with both extracts, we noticed that the retarded bands corresponding to ft- <dig>  ft- <dig>  ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> oligo probes displayed completely different patterns when challenged with the two extracts. these results prompted us to investigate the possibility that on the cns <dig> were present consensus sequences for thyroid-specific transcription factors. we then used the transfac analysis software  to search for transcription factors binding sites and intriguingly, we found that ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> were predicted to have binding sites for the thyroid-enriched transcription factor ttf- <dig>  consequently, the remaining of our study was focused on these two footprints.

to further characterize and verify the predictions obtained with the transfac analysis on ft- <dig> and ft- <dig>  we proceeded with more exhaustive emsa assays. initially, we incubated the same ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> 32p-labelled oligo probes both with pc cl <dig> total protein extract or with bacterially produced and purified ttf- <dig> protein  . as control of the binding, we used the 32p-labelled oligo c described before  <cit> , which is proved to bind the ttf- <dig> protein. as expected, bttf <dig> binds to the oligo c and produces a retarded band similar to that observed with the total protein extract. interestingly, the incubation of bttf- <dig> with the ft- <dig> and the ft- <dig> oligos produced a retarded band identical to the one observed in the binding of bttf- <dig> with the oligo c, suggesting that ttf- <dig> is indeed the protein binding to the ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> probes. in addition, the retarded band observed when the pc cl <dig> protein extract was incubated with the ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> oligo probes is the result of a specific interaction, as demonstrated by competition assays . cross-competition further strengthened the data that indeed the ft- <dig>  ft- <dig> and oligo c sequences bind the same protein . to further consolidate our data, we performed supershift assays with an anti-ttf <dig> specific antibody. also in this case, as shown in figure 4b, we observed that to the supershifted band produced after the incubation of the oligo c with pc cl <dig> protein extract and the anti-ttf <dig> antibody, exactly corresponds an identical supershifted band in the lanes corresponding to the ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> oligo probes. the specificity of these three supershifted bands is confirmed by the reduction of the expected retarded bands corresponding to ttf-1-oligo complex and by the absence of a supershift when the hela protein extract or the anti-tubulin antibody is used.

to demonstrate the ability of ttf- <dig> to interact with the cns <dig> also in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments on pc cl <dig> cells. the crosslinked chromatin was immunoprecipitated using the antibody against ttf- <dig>  as control, to rule out unspecific background of the chip assay, we performed one reaction using an unrelated antibody. the enrichment of the endogenous cns <dig> region was monitored by pcr amplification using specific primers. indeed, we demonstrate that, in agreement with the in vitro data, ttf- <dig> antibody is able to immunoprecipitate the chromatin containing the cns <dig> element . this result confirms the in vitro binding data presented in this paper, and clearly demonstrate that the thyroid-enriched transcription factor ttf- <dig> is able to bind in vivo the pax <dig> far upstream element cns <dig> 

ft <dig> and ft <dig> are key regions for the transcriptional activity of the cns87
to better understand the functional role of the ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> regions in the transcriptional activity of the cns <dig>  we decided to mutagenize them by generating site-specific point mutations in both ttf- <dig> binding sites, separately or in combination. we chose the mutations with the help of the bioinformatics predictions of the ttf- <dig> binding consensus sequence such that on the cns <dig> element ttf- <dig> binding was totally abrogated in the ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> regions and no other ttf- <dig> binding site was generated within the entire element. in this way, we prepared three new cns87-tk vectors that were named cns87-ft1m, cns87-ft6m and cns87-ft1-6m . we used each of these three vectors in transient transfection experiments in pc cl <dig> cells as described before, and we compared the results obtained transfecting these mutated vectors with the wild-type cns87-tk. in figure 5b, we show that the transcriptional activity of the cns87-wt transfected in pc cl <dig> cells is significantly higher then the transcriptional activities corresponding to each of the three mutants, indicating that both ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> are involved in the transcriptional activity of the cns <dig>  in particular, mutation in ft- <dig> gives the highest level of reduction in the transcriptional activity while the combination of mutations in both ft1/ <dig> does not potentiate this reduction. these results led us to recognize as most critical the role of ft- <dig> among the other footprints present on the cns <dig> 

ttf- <dig> activates transcription from the cns <dig> and is involved in pax <dig> expression in thyroid cells
since ttf- <dig> was the only confirmed binding factor on the cns <dig>  and to better understand its role in the transcriptional activity of this element, we decided to perform transactivation experiments in a heterologous recipient. hence, we transfected hela cells with the wild-type cns <dig> vector alone or in co-transfection with an expression vector encoding ttf- <dig>  the results showed in figure 5c demonstrated that the co-transfection of the transcription factor ttf- <dig> is capable to strongly activate transcription from the cns <dig>  and in particular the fold activity of luciferase expression obtained in co-transfection experiments clearly resembles the levels obtained transfecting the cns <dig> in the physiological pc cl <dig> cell recipient.

to better elucidate and confirm the role of ttf- <dig> in the regulation of pax <dig> expression, we used the experimental model described by dentice et al.  <cit>  in which ttf- <dig> gene expression is stably knocked down. this cell model consists of a thyroid-specific cell line frtl- <dig> stable transfected with an shrna vector driven against ttf- <dig> mrna. among the selected clones, cl- <dig> and cl- <dig> showed a significantly reduced ttf- <dig> expression. we performed q-pcr analysis on total rna prepared from these two clones and from control untransfected frtl- <dig> cells. we confirmed that in both clones ttf- <dig> expression was reduced and we showed that to the reduction of ttf- <dig> expression clearly corresponds a significant reduction of pax <dig> expression , indicating that the level of expression of the two transcription factors is indeed correlated. to further demonstrate that the cell model used reflects the physiology of the thyroid cell, we analyzed by q-pcr the expression in cl- <dig> and cl- <dig> also of one important thyroid differentiation marker, i.e. the thyroglobulin  gene that is a well known target of both ttf- <dig> and pax <dig>  <cit> . as expected, tg gene expression was significantly reduced in both cl- <dig> and cl- <dig> . the fact that tg decreases more than the two transcription factors could be the consequence of the synergic action of ttf- <dig> and pax <dig> on the tg promoter, demonstrated both in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit> .

all together these data confirm that ttf- <dig> is responsible for the full expression of the pax <dig> gene and fit perfectly with our previous data in which we demonstrated the transcriptional activity of ttf- <dig> on the pax <dig> far upstream enhancer cns <dig> 

cns <dig> is a distant regulatory element that controls pax <dig> expression
to verify whether pax <dig> expression could be regulated by a distant cis-acting sequence like the cns <dig> element that we had identified, we used bacterial artificial chromosome  vectors. the pax <dig> genomic locus is located on chromosome  <dig> with a length of about  <dig> kb. as previously described, the cns <dig> element is located about  <dig> kb upstream the pax <dig> 5'utr so both the pax <dig> gene and the cns <dig> sequence largely fit into a bac vector. we obtained several bacs from the bac pac resources of the children's hospital oakland research institute  that respected the reported parameters and we looked for the presence of both pax <dig> gene and the cns <dig> into the same bac vector with a pcr strategy . once we identified the bac useful for our studies, we followed the convenient recombineering strategy to genetically engineer the selected bac, in order to obtain that the bac vector expresses the luciferase reporter gene instead of the pax <dig> gene. this luc-containing bac vector, named wtcns87bac-luc, can still be considered wild type with respect to the whole region upstream the pax <dig> gene, that is the region containing the cns <dig> and the putative promoter. to unravel the role of the cns <dig> in its physiological genomic context, we further modified the wtcns87bac-luc vector, again by means of recombineering, to eliminate the entire cns <dig> region that was replaced by an ampicillin-resistance cassette . we then used these two bac vectors in stable transfections assays in pc cl <dig> cells. cells were transfected with wtcns87bac-luc or with delcns87bac-luc and after a 2-weeks g <dig> selection two different pools of stable clones were generated for each of the transfected vector. protein extracts were prepared and the luciferase activity was measured. the results, reported in figure  <dig>  showed a strong transcriptional activity of the wtcns87bac-luc as it was expected since, as mentioned above, pax <dig> putative promoter and every other transcriptional element are preserved in this bac vector. on the other hand, the level of luciferase expression corresponding to the delcns87bac-luc vector is significantly reduced compared to the wtcns87bac-luc luciferase expression. the absence of any other difference between the two bac vectors, with the exception of the cns <dig> deletion, led us to the conclusion that the cns <dig> is a distant regulatory element that controls the expression level of the pax <dig> gene.

discussion
comparative analysis of non-coding sequences between evolutionary correlated species is one of the new tools of the genomic era widely used when researchers want to look for regulatory mechanisms that are conserved throughout evolution. such an approach in fact leads to the identification of highly conserved sequences that may be functionally relevant and to the discovery of new transcription factors binding sites and mechanisms that were to be known yet. inter-genomic comparisons indeed, are rapidly evolving for investigations of regulatory regions involved in promoter activity  <cit> .

pax <dig>  a thyroid-enriched transcription factor, plays a key role in thyroid development and differentiation  <cit> . despite its essential function, the transcriptional regulation of the pax <dig> gene remains poorly characterized. in this paper, we describe the identification of the first transcriptional regulatory element of the pax8/pax <dig> gene. we achieved our results by coupling modern computational studies with experimental emsa analysis and promoter/reporter assays.

we performed comparative studies on human and mouse genomic sequences flanking the pax <dig> gene looking for conserved sequences to explore the possibility that such conserved non-coding sequences  may be instrumental in guiding the thyroid-specific expression of pax <dig>  by globally aligning a large fragment of the human and mouse pax <dig> genomic locus, we found about  <dig> cns that fitted our search criteria. however, we decided to focus our attention only on  <dig> of those sequences located in the 5'-flanking region of the pax <dig> gene extending for about  <dig> kb upstream the start of transcription. using promoter/reporter assays, we identified one conserved and functional sequence with a typical enhancer behavior specifically acting in thyroid cells and we named this sequence cns <dig> . in particular, this conserved sequence is a far upstream element, conserved between human and mouse, that turned out to be a target of the action of another thyroid-enriched transcription factor, i.e. ttf-1/nkx <dig> .

using several mutant mouse lines, parlato et al. have established that in thyroid cell precursors the transcription factor ttf- <dig> and pax <dig> are linked in a complex network of reciprocal regulatory interaction  <cit> . our data strongly support this scenario indicating that ttf- <dig>  through the cns <dig> element, is involved in the regulation of pax <dig> gene expression in the environment of the thyroid cell. in fact, the cns <dig> has all the features typical of an enhancer since it can stimulates the transcription of a reporter gene in a very strong and tissue-specific manner. a peculiar feature of the cns <dig> element is its location about  <dig> kb upstream from the 5'utr of the mouse/human pax <dig> gene. it is noteworthy that a sequence located so far from a gene could be related with its expression. however, many examples exist in the literature on regulatory elements located very far from both the 5'end and the 3'end or even inside other genes. the most representative example came from sonic hedgehog gene , where its regulatory element is located  <dig> mb upstream of shh, embedded in a gene that resides in a cluster of unrelated genes  <cit> . in addition, many model of action have been developed for long distance acting regulatory elements. such models imply the existence of factors that have the ability to bring and stimulate genes in active compartment of the chromatin. therefore regulatory elements get closer to the proximal regulatory region of a gene allowing the start of the transcription  <cit> .

the notion that the cns <dig> could indeed serve as a regulatory element of pax <dig> gene expression was further reinforced by the experimental observation with the bac transfection assays. those data clearly confirm that the cns <dig> fragment is required for the full expression of the pax <dig> gene.

the bioinformatics predictions of the transcription factors binding sites in this cns element further highlight the physical experimental data. the transfac program predicted two binding sites for the thyroid-enriched transcription factor ttf- <dig> within footprints  <dig> and  <dig>  indeed, when the sequences corresponding to the ft- <dig> and ft- <dig> are mutated the cns <dig> activity is severely reduced respect to that of the wild-type fragment confirming that ttf- <dig> is leading the activity of this element.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data suggest that the transcription factor ttf- <dig> participates to pax <dig> gene expression directly binding to its 5'-flanking region and activating transcription from the cns <dig> regulatory element that we have identified and characterized. in conclusion, this paper puts a milestone in the understanding of the regulation of the expression of the transcription factor pax <dig> and will contribute to the establishment of a fine intergenic network between thyroid enriched transcription factors and their roles during development and adult life.
