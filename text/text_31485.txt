BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite and the etiological agent of chagas disease in humans, also known as american trypanosomiasis. t. cruzi infects over  <dig> species of mammalian hosts and is the leading cause of infection-induced heart failure in latin america  <cit> . in  <dig>  approximately  <dig>  deaths have been reported as a result of the clinical complications of t. cruzi-induced heart disease and the lack of effective treatment  <cit> .

t. cruzi has four morphologically and physiologically distinct stages. the bloodstream trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes stages of parasites are in the mammalian host, whereas epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes develop in the insect vector  <cit> . the diploid genome of t. cruzi contains approximately  <dig> chromosomes encoding a predicted set of  <dig>  proteins, of which at least  <dig>  represent allelic pairs  <cit> . allelic copies of genes in the hybrid cl brener genome may vary in sequence by as much as  <dig> %, and trisomy has also been suggested in the case of some chromosomes  <cit> . putative functions could be assigned to  <dig> % of the predicted protein-coding genes on the basis of significant similarity to previously characterized proteins or known functional domains  <cit> .

in contrast to the substantial in silico studies of the t. cruzi genome, only  <dig> genes have been experimentally characterized by reverse genetics in t. cruzi  <cit> . these genes were all disrupted through homologous recombination, using a dna cassette that has a drug selectable marker flanked by the coding sequence or the untranslated regions  of the target gene. although effective, this conventional gene knockout approach not only requires identification of multiple compatible restriction sites for ligation reactions and for vector linearization, it also involves multiple restriction digestions, ligations and cloning steps that make the process cumbersome and time-consuming  <cit> . given that rna interference has, to date, failed to function in t. cruzi  <cit>  , a simplified strategy to knockout genes in t. cruzi would vastly improve the characterization of the multitude of genes encoding proteins without confirmed or even putative functions.

in this study, we sought to develop a simpler method for the deletion of t. cruzi genes. we compared the conventional multi-step knockout technique with two knockout strategies that have been proven to work in other organisms, one-step-pcr- and multisite gateway  -based systems. we attempted to knockout the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase  using all three techniques, and enoyl-coa hydratase  genes using the two alternative approaches. our results show that gene-specific sequences of  <dig> nucleotides used in one-step-pcr strategy are not sufficient to guarantee homologous recombination in t. cruzi. however, the ms/gw-based approach is able to efficiently disrupt target genes. in addition, using the ms/gw strategy, generation of knockout constructs can be completed in as few as  <dig> days. the results of this study will provide a powerful new tool for reverse genetic studies of t. cruzi.

RESULTS
dhfr-ts gene is disrupted using a conventional ko construct
the dhfr-ts gene is annotated as two identical alleles in the diploid cl brener reference strain and codes for dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate syntase  <cit> . in most organisms these two enzyme activities are present on separate monofunctional enzymes. in contrast, in t. cruzi both enzymes are on the same polypeptide chain, with the dhfr domain at the amino terminus and the ts domain at the carboxy terminus  <cit> . since these enzymes catalyze consecutive reactions in the de novo synthesis of 2'-deoxythymidylate , they have been used as targets for chemotherapy, as inhibition of either enzyme disrupts the dtmp cycle and results in thymidine auxotrophy  <cit> .

g <dig> -resistant parasites were obtained after transfection of the recombination fragment excised from the plasmid pbsdh1f8neo  into the tulahuen strain of t. cruzi. we included a  <dig> bp 1f <dig> fraction in the construct so as to provide a trans-splicing acceptor site and a putative polyadenylation signal to the drug resistance gene  <cit> . figure 1a shows the expected genomic loci of dhfr-ts and 1f8neo in dhfr-ts+/-/neo parasites. as expected no amplification of the 1f8neo was observed in tulahuen wt  parasites as shown by pcr with primers n1-n <dig> . pcr using primers in the flanking genes corroborates the correct insertion of 1f8neo gene in dhfr-ts+/- parasite's genome. when using n3-r <dig>  n3-r <dig> and n3-r <dig> combinations, bands of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb respectively, were observed, providing further confirmation that the neomycin phosphotransferase gene  had been inserted in the correct locus . the insertion in the dhfr-ts locus was also confirmed by southern blot analysis with gdna from cloned dhfr-ts+/- and wt parasites digested with sali and probed with dhfr-ts . when digested with enzymes sali and probed with dhfr-ts cds we observe a band of  <dig>  kb in wild type parasites while mutants have a  <dig> bp insertion corresponding to the 1f8neo cassette interrupting the dhfr-ts cds, resulting in an extra  <dig>  kb band in the mutants.

dhfr-ts gene is replaced using a ms/gw construct
since we were able to obtain dhfr-ts+/- parasites we concluded that this gene would be a good candidate to evaluate the one-step-pcr and multisite gateway-based systems for gene knockout constructs in t. cruzi. in the ms/gw recombination fragments, the flanking regions of the gene were used as arms for recombination event, in contrast with the method in figure  <dig> where the coding sequence of the gene was used for homologous recombination.

drug resistant lines produced by the transfection of tulahuen strain epimastigotes with a recombination fragment obtained from pdest/dhfr-ts_1f8hyg plasmid  were cloned and analyzed by pcr and southern blot. figure 2a shows the expected genomic loci of dhfr-ts and 1f8hyg in the genome of dhfr-ts+/-/hyg parasites; the results of pcr analysis  confirm the correct insertion of 1f8hyg replacing one allele of the dhfr-ts gene . southern blot analysis also showed correct insertion of the 1f8hyg cassette replacing one copy of the dhfr-ts gene in the genome. the expected  <dig> bp band was observed in bsrgi digested dna from dhfr-ts+/- cloned parasites and probed with hyg  cds but not in the wt parasites .

consecutive ech <dig> and ech <dig> genes are simultaneously replaced by constructs generated based on ms/gw system
t. cruzi ech <dig> and ech <dig> are tandemly arranged genes  with a nucleotide sequence identity of 67%. both genes encode putative enoyl-coa hydratase/isomerase  family proteins, which catalyze the second step in the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. analysis of the t. cruzi proteome suggested that enzymes in the fatty acid oxidation pathway, including ech, are preferentially expressed in amastigotes  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that we would be able to knockout both ech <dig> and ech <dig> genes in epimastigotes. the ech locus also provides an opportunity to test whether or not the ms/gw approach can be used to produce knockouts of multiple genes that are physically linked in the genome.

in t. cruzi, transcript stability and protein translation is largely controlled by 3'utr and intergenic regions  <cit> . the intergenic region of a constitutively expressed gene, gapdh, gives consistently high levels of stable rna in different constructs and in different life cycle stages  <cit> . hence, we included the 3' utr of gapdh in our constructs, to ensure the expression of the inserted drug resistant genes in the epimastigote stage. transfection of the dna fragment from pdest/ech-hyg-gapdh  resulted in parasite lines that were resistant to hyg selection. figure 3a shows the expected genomic loci of ech and hyg-gapdh-ir in the genome of ech+/-/hyg parasites. pcr analysis with the genomic dna from the drug resistant parasites and wt cl confirmed the expected gene replacement of ech <dig> and ech <dig> genes by hyg-gapdh-ir ; no products were obtained when using wt cl gdna as the template with primer combinations f <dig> and d, f <dig> and f, c and r <dig>  and e and r <dig>  whereas products of the expected sizes,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, were observed with gdna from ech+/-/hyg as the template. southern blot analysis of ecor i digested gdna using the ech <dig> gene as a probe  showed a  <dig> bp band corresponding to the replaced allelic copy of both ech genes was undetected in ech+/-/hyg, whereas the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp bands corresponding to the second allele were retained. in addition, a  <dig> bp band and a  <dig> bp band corresponding to the inserted hyg-gapdh-ir were observed in bani digested gdna of only the ech+/-/hyg, but not that of wt cl . taken together, these results confirmed that one copy of each of the tandem ech <dig> and ech <dig> genes was replaced by the ms/gw hyg-gapdh-ir knockout cassette.

similarly, using linearized dna from pdest/ech_neo-gapdh , we generated ech+/-/neo parasites with one copy of both ech <dig> and ech <dig> gene replaced by neo-gapdh-3'utr knockout cassette . this result is confirmed by both pcr amplification  of gdna of the drug resistant parasites, as pcr with primer combinations f <dig> and b, and f <dig> and h generated  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp bands respectively only in drug resistant parasites. southern blot hybridization also showed a  <dig> bp neo gene band in the ech+/-/neo parasites .

one-step-pcr knockout strategy fails to delete dhfr-ts and ech genes
since we demonstrated that at least one allele of the dhfr-ts can be deleted using the ms/gw based system, we next tested if this gene can be deleted using the one-step-pcr strategy. transfection and selection of parasites with the knockout cassette lp-dhfr-ts-neo failed to yield drug resistant parasites, despite  <dig> independent attempts. as there are  <dig> nts of the cds of dhfr-ts gene in both forward long primers used to produce lp-dhfr-ts-neo, the drug selectable markers were to be expressed as a fusion protein, with  <dig> amino acids of the start of dhfr-ts gene fused at the n terminal. it is possible that the knockout parasites were not obtained because the drug selectable marker has reduced enzyme activity when expressed as a fusion protein. to exclude this possibility, we constructed lp-dhfr-ts-utr-neo to completely delete the entire dhfr-ts sequence. this construct has  <dig> nts of the utr of dhfr-ts gene instead of the cds, providing production of neomycin phosphotransferase as a non-fusion protein. however, as with the previous construction, no resistant parasites could be obtained despite  <dig> independent electroporations. furthermore, one-step-pcr strategy also failed to delete the ech <dig> and ech <dig> genes despite  <dig> independent transfection and selection attempts. therefore, the constructs generated with one-step-pcr strategy that bear  <dig> nts gene cds or utr specific sequence are likely to be insufficient for homologous recombination in t. cruzi.

discussion
experimental characterization of gene functions in trypanosomatids has relied heavily on reverse genetic approaches and has been facilitated by the development and optimization of gene manipulation strategies and transfection protocols  <cit> . in contrast to the robust and extensive techniques for genetic manipulation documented in trypanosoma brucei and leishmania, the validated techniques and record of success for t. cruzi is much less extensive. a goal of this study was to validate gene ko strategies for t. cruzi which might facilitate research on this important cause of human disease.

toward that end, we have compared a conventional multi-step cloning technique with two knockout strategies that have been proven to target gene deletion in other organisms, one-step-pcr and multisite gateway. the appeal of the one-step-pcr- strategy is the speed with which constructs can be produced. however, the attempts to knockout either ech or dhfr-ts genes in t. cruzi using this approach were unsuccessful, presumably because the  <dig> nucleotide-gene-specific regions used in our constructs were insufficient for homologous recombination in t. cruzi. this result is perhaps not surprising as studies in leishmania  <cit>  demonstrated that at least  <dig> nucleotides are needed to guide homologous recombination. however, a recombination rate of  <dig> × 10- <dig> was obtained with as short as  <dig> nucleotides homology in t. brucei  <cit> . because of the considerable expense of oligos of > <dig> bp, we did not investigate the minimum length needed for consistent recombination in t. cruzi, believing such an approach to be impractical for economical, high-efficiency gene knockouts.

the multisite gateway-based approach, although not as simple as the one-step-pcr strategy, is far less time-consuming than the standard conventional methods. in particular, extensive restriction mapping, digestion and ligation steps are not needed at all with the ms/gw approach  <cit> . pdonr vectors containing drug resistance genes can be generated once and then repeatedly re-used for production of knockout constructs for different genes, further increasing the efficiency of the process. once regions flanking the genes of interest are obtained from the att- pcr amplifications, the knockout dna constructs can be generated within as few as five days . the bp and lr reactions are robust and have very high success rates; typically, at least 90% colonies screened from our bp and lr reactions are positive. using the ms/gw knockout constructs, we successfully obtained dhfr-ts+/- and ech+/- parasites in two different t. cruzi strains. in on-going work, we have used ms/gw constructs to successfully produce single as well as double ko lines for more than  <dig> other genes, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides and up to  <dig> copies . thus the ms/gw approach appears to be amenable to use as part of a higher throughput gene knockout project.

overall, the results described here identify the multisite gateway  -based system as an efficient tool to create knockout construction for deletion of genes in t. cruzi and should help accelerate the functional analysis of a wider array of genes in this important agent of disease.

CONCLUSIONS
this study documents the development of a multisite gateway based method for efficient gene knockout in t. cruzi. further, we demonstrate that long-primer-based ko constructs with < <dig> nucleotides of homologous gene sequences are insufficient for consistent homologous recombination in t. cruzi. the increase in efficiency of gene knockout constructs should facilitate increased throughput for the identification of gene function in t. cruzi using reverse genetics.
