BACKGROUND
gabaa-rs are the major inhibitory receptors in the mammalian central nervous system and can be modulated by a number of sedative, hypnotic and anesthetic drugs  <cit> . gabaa-rs are putatively pentameric complexes and are members of a 'superfamily' of related ligand-gated ion channels. there are a variety of subunit families that make up gabaa-rs; a total of seventeen distinct subunits have been cloned, α1– <dig>  β1– <dig>  γ1– <dig>  δ, ε, π, and θ. much is known of the subunits that comprise gabaa-rs, but the contribution of individual subunits to in vivo drug responses is only beginning to be understood, largely through the use of genetically engineered mice  <cit> .

the γ <dig> subunit is highly expressed throughout developing and adult brain and spinal cord, is a component of almost 60% of all gabaa-rs  <cit> , and is required for synaptic clustering of gabaa-rs  <cit> . in vitro electrophysiologic studies have demonstrated an obligatory role of the γ <dig> subunit for benzodiazepine responsiveness  <cit> . gunther et al. created and studied mice that globally lacked all γ <dig> subunits of the gabaa-r  <cit> . mice homozygous for the γ <dig> knockout died in the perinatal period with rare survivors reaching postnatal day  <dig>  knockouts appeared normal at birth, but developed sensorimotor abnormalities characterized by hyperactivity, impaired grasping and righting reflex, and abnormal gait. pharmacologically, knockout of γ <dig> resulted in a severe deficit in benzodiazepine binding sites  while gaba binding sites were only slightly reduced. behaviorally, in the few mice that survived long enough to be tested, diazepam failed to induce sedation and loss of the righting reflex at doses that were fully effective in wild type mice  <cit> . γ <dig> heterozygous knockout mice were normally viable, had a ~50% reduction in γ <dig> protein levels, and displayed increased anxiety-like behaviors  <cit> . drug responses of heterozygous γ <dig> global knockouts have not been reported, except for the high efficacy of low diazepam doses to induce anxiolysis  <cit> .

we set out to make mice with markedly attenuated expression of the γ <dig> gene  that would be viable and therefore useful for studies of basic behaviors and drug induced responses. we used gene targeting and embryonic stem cell technologies to create this mouse line by inserting a neomycin resistance gene  into intron  <dig> of the γ <dig> genomic locus. insertion of neo into intronic dna has previously been used to create hypomorphic alleles of several genes  <cit> . in those studies, expression of the hypomorphic allele ranged from 5–25% of control; substantially lower than the 50% reduction typically observed in heterozygous knockouts. the γ <dig> knockdown mouse line described in the present report had a highly variable reduction in γ <dig> mrna and protein levels. γ <dig> knockdown mice were normally viable, had increased anxiety-like behaviors, but did not differ in the hypnotic response to benzodiazepines. in addition, since exon  <dig> of the γ <dig> gene was flanked by loxp sites in this mouse line, these mice could also be converted into a global knockout mouse by crossing to a general deleter cre-expressing transgenic mouse line.

RESULTS
production of gene targeted mice
four out of  <dig> embryonic stem cell clones displayed the predicted restriction fragment length polymorphisms  indicative of the targeting event presented in fig 1a. because the targeting event results in a γ <dig> locus in which exon  <dig> is flanked by loxp sites, we refer to this locus as being floxed  in contrast to the endogenous wild type allele . two correctly targeted cell lines, 26l <dig> and 26c <dig> yielded germ-line competent chimeric males. chimeras were mated to c57bl/6j females. offspring that were +/f were interbred to produce +/+, +/f, and f/f mice. mice were genotyped at weaning using southern blot analysis as indicated in fig 1b. in this analysis, probe a hybridized to a  <dig>  kb bglii fragment from the wild type γ <dig> allele and a  <dig>  kb fragment from the targeted allele. of  <dig> mice genotyped,  <dig>  were +/+,  <dig>  were +/f, and  <dig>  were f/f. these values are in accord with the 1:2: <dig> genotype frequency as expected by mendelian genetics. thus, homozygous floxed mice were normally viable. they were also healthy and overtly indistinguishable from wild type mice.

northern blot analysis
semi-quantitative northern blots were used to compare the amount of γ <dig> mrna in wild type and f/f animals. hybridization of adult brain rna with a γ <dig> cdna probe yielded an intense  <dig>  kb band in wild type mice. in contrast, rna from f/f mice hybridized less intensely in most mice, however the attenuation within this group was highly variable. a sample northern blot is shown in figure 2a. we semi-quantitatively determined γ <dig> mrna amounts by comparing γ <dig> band densities between wild type  and f/f  mice following normalization with β-actin. to normalize results over four different blots, the ratio of wild type band densities on each blot was averaged and normalized to  <dig>  all samples on each blot were then compared to the average of wild type band densities. values are shown in figure 2b. mean wild type ratio was  <dig> whereas mean ratio in f/f samples was  <dig> with high variability including several mice with values that overlapped with wild type values. thus, γ <dig> mrna levels in knockdown mice were dramatically attenuated on average, but the levels varied significantly between mice.

immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemical staining of sagittal sections probed with a γ2-specific antibody was used to assess γ <dig> protein amount and distribution in the brain. a sampling of wild type  and knockdown  brain sections are displayed. in three of the four knockdown mouse sections shown, there was a marked overall reduction of γ <dig> immunoreactivity in all areas of the brain except the outer layer of the olfactory bulb. however, staining intensity was variable between knockdown mice, with one having near wild type intensity . a total of  <dig> f/f mice were studied. seven out of  <dig> had a marked decrease in γ <dig> staining compared to wild type controls, and three out of  <dig> had near wild-type or intermediate levels of staining. adjacent sections from these same mice showed no change in α <dig> or β2/ <dig> immunoreactivity .

pharmacological characterization
autoradiography on brain cryostat sections with various ligands binding to selective sites of the gabaa-r revealed clear differences in the homozygous γ <dig> knockdowns as compared to heterozygous and wild type mice . total flumazenil-sensitive ro15- <dig> binding to benzodiazepine sites was reduced in the knockdown in most brain regions. the reduced binding in the  <dig> mice analyzed ranged on the average from  <dig> to 57%. in several regions, the heterozygous mice also showed significant reduction of the binding, but clearly less than the homozygous knockdown samples. a small proportion of the reduction in the total binding was apparently due to reduction in diazepam-insensitive α <dig> and α <dig> subunit-containing receptors, this component being mostly affected in the cerebellar granule cell layer.

gaba-sensitive muscimol binding to gaba agonist sites was not altered in any brain region .

picrotoxinin-sensitive tbps binding to the gabaa-r channels was little affected between the mouse lines: basal binding was increased in the hippocampus and decreased in the cerebellar granule cell layer of the homozygous γ <dig> knockdowns . the gaba-insensitive tbps binding was increased all over the brain, but this component still made up less than 10% of the basal binding, except for the cerebellar granule cell layer. there, the gaba-insensitive component was 20% as compared to 10% in the heterozygous and wild type animals.

behavioral characterization
we examined the behavioral phenotype of the knockdown mice using the elevated plus maze and forced exploration in a novel open field. the elevated plus maze is widely used to assess anxiety-like behavior in response to the aversive stimulus of an elevated exposed space. on this test apparatus, knockdown mice had a 74% reduction in open arm entries  and an 83% reduction in time on open arms  compared to controls suggesting an increase in anxiety-like behavior. in contrast, knockdown mice had the same number of total arm entries as wild types  indicating that an alteration in locomotion does not account for the differences in anxiety-like behavioral measures on this assay.

knockdown mice were also tested for behavioral response to an aversive, brightly lit open field test apparatus using the forced novelty exploration test. knockdown mice had a 28% reduction in locomotor activity compared to wild type mice when placed into this test arena . this reduction in exploratory behavior in the knockdown animals is also indicative of an increase in anxiety-like behavior.

knockdown of the γ <dig> subunit did not alter hypnotic responses to benzodiazepine site ligands or other sedative/hypnotic drugs tested. we measured the loss of righting reflex to assess the acute sensitivity to sedative/hypnotic drugs; no significant differences were found in response to injection of diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, ethanol, or pentobarbital .

production of γ <dig> global knockout mice
the gene targeting strategy that we used to produce the γ <dig> knockdown mice also resulted in the insertion of loxp sites that flank exon  <dig> of the γ <dig> gene . to determine if these loxp sites were functional in vivo, heterozygous floxed γ <dig> mice were mated to a general deleter cre-expressing transgenic mouse line  where the cre transgene was driven by a ubiquitously expressed human beta actin promoter  <cit> . restriction fragment polymorphism analysis by southern blotting confirmed the deletion of genomic dna between loxp sites. as predicted from fig. 1a, probe a hybridized to a  <dig>  kb bglii fragment from the recombined knockout allele .

to determine if cre-mediated recombination and deletion of exon  <dig> resulted in a null allele, mice hemizygous for the cre transgene and heterozygous for the recombined γ <dig> allele  were mated to mice heterozygous for the floxed, non-recombined γ <dig> allele .  <dig> %  of offspring from this mating strategy were homozygous for the recombined locus . this ratio is in agreement with the  <dig> % predicted from mendalian genetics.  <dig> of the  <dig> f/f mice died within three days of birth. one f/f mouse survived until postnatal day  <dig>  this neonatal lethality of γ <dig> f/f mice is consistent with those found in the global γ <dig> knockouts of günther et al.  <cit>  which also had a deletion of exon  <dig>  therefore, we conclude that cre-mediated recombination of the loxp sites and deletion of exon  <dig> inactivates the γ <dig> gene.

discussion
genetic dissection of the gabaa-r system is yielding remarkable insights into gabaa-r biology and the mechanisms of action of various drugs. here we report the establishment of a new gabaa-r mutant mouse model, one with attenuated expression of the γ <dig> subunit that averages ~35% of normal levels. this novel γ <dig> knockdown model has several unique features that make it useful. first, compared to global knockouts which die as neonates  <cit> , knockdown mice have normal viability. secondly, the graded levels of expression of γ <dig>  in the mutant mice could be useful in studies correlating phenotype with the amount of γ <dig> protein present. finally, global knockout mice can be created from these mice by crossing to a cre recombinase expressing global deleter mouse line. therefore, the mice reported here represent a useful addition to the rapidly expanding arsenal of mice with genetic alterations in the γ <dig> subunit of the gabaa-r. in addition to homozygous and heterozygous global γ <dig> knockouts  <cit> , conditional γ <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , knockin mice with a point mutation in γ <dig> that eliminates zolpidem and inverse agonist β-carboline sensitivity  <cit> , global knockout of the long splice variant of γ <dig>  <cit> , and transgenic mice that express either the long or short splice variants of the γ <dig> subunit  <cit>  have been described.

an important unexpected finding from this study was the extremely variable degree to which the genetic alteration of the γ <dig> locus changed the amount of γ <dig> product produced. this γ <dig> knockdown model was produced by insertion of neo into intronic dna. this strategy has been used previously to create hypomorphic alleles  <cit> . creation of hypomorphic alleles has been useful in determining function of the gene that has been targeted, especially in cases where complete disruption of the gene is lethal  <cit> . intronic insertion of neo creates hypomorphic alleles either through cryptic splicing signals in the neo gene that lead to a frameshift or alterations in splicing, or by down regulating gene expression through an unknown mechanism  <cit> . in the majority of these studies, the authors' reported a 5–25% level of expression from the targeted gene. however, in none of these previously described hypomorphic alleles was extensive variability reported. the γ <dig> targeted homozygous mice in this study clearly display a wide range of γ <dig> mrna and protein levels. semi-quantitative northern blot analysis revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> homozygous knockdown mice showed, on average, a 70% reduction of γ <dig> mrna levels, whereas  <dig> out of  <dig> mice had γ <dig> mrna at a level that was similar to wild type. immunohistochemical data were consistent with northern blot data. the reason for this highly variable expression within homozygous knockdown mice has yet to be determined. the mixed background of strain 129s1/x <dig> and c57bl6/j may not be the cause given that other studies have not observed substantial variability in expression using similar background strains  <cit> . gender as a cause of variability also is not likely given that a set of three male knockdown siblings exhibited the full range of γ <dig> levels; one being near wild type levels, another being at an intermediate level, and the third exhibiting severely attenuated expression. further study to determine the cause of this variability needs to be undertaken. nevertheless, investigators who desire to create a hypomorphic allele by inserting neo into intronic dna should take into consideration the variability of gene expression observed in this study. the extent of variability may be locus dependent.

knockdown of γ <dig> subunit containing gabaa-rs resulted in behavioral changes that are indicative of increased anxiety-like behavior. these mutant knockdown mice showed reduced exploratory behavior for a novel open field apparatus and the open arms of the elevated plus maze. similar changes have been observed in γ <dig> global heterozygous knockout mice  <cit> . together, these results strengthen the possibility that gabaa-r dysfunction may be an underlying cause of anxiety disorders in humans. these mutant mouse models may be useful for dissecting the etiology of this pervasive condition and for developing effective therapeutic interventions.

as expected, brains from γ <dig> knockdown mice demonstrated significantly decreased binding of the benzodiazepine site ligand, ro15- <dig>  this was expected since benzodiazepine binding sites are located at the interface of select alpha and γ <dig> subunits of the gabaa-r  <cit> . the reduction observed in ro15- <dig> binding agree with those from global γ <dig> knockout mice  <cit>  in that deficiency of the γ <dig> subunit abolishes the binding of the benzodiazepine-site ligands. the global heterozygous γ <dig> knockout mice have a reduction in total ro15- <dig> binding in most brain regions  <cit> , and the present data on the γ <dig> knockdown show a very similar pattern of reduced binding. however, the  <dig> knockdown brains that we examined had actually a greater reduction in benzodiazepine binding than the γ <dig> heterozygous global knockouts published earlier  <cit> . similar to the γ <dig> heterozygous knockouts, muscimol binding was not affected, indicating that the reduction of the γ <dig> subunit levels is not compensated by increased δ subunit that is largely responsible for the muscimol binding signal in brain sections  <cit> . the basal binding of the ion channel ligand tbps is usually reduced and its sensitivity to gaba increased by addition of γ <dig> subunits  <cit> . both in the γ <dig> heterozygous global knockout and in our homozygous knockdown, tbps binding was increased in some brain regions, and, more consistently, there emerged a "gaba-insensitive" receptor population with widespread distribution in the brain. this indicates production of gabaa-rs with an αβ configuration. these receptors bind strongly the agonist and have reduced channel conductance  <cit> , perhaps reflecting only partial agonist efficacy of gaba. this would explain the reduced allosteric efficacy of gaba in abolishing tbps binding. in addition, these receptors have most likely non-synaptic, non-clustered localization as they lack the γ <dig> subunit  <cit> . therefore, the partially γ <dig> depleted mice may have brain region-selective alterations in synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors, and the reduced synaptic gabaa-r function might correlate with the anxious phenotype. however, surprisingly, the high-dose hypnotic effects of the benzodiazepine site ligands diazepam, zolpidem and midazolam were unchanged in the knockdown mice.

several hypotheses can be generated to explain the discrepancy between decreased benzodiazepine ligand binding and unchanged hypnotic effects. one possibility is that only a threshold level of γ <dig> containing gabaa-rs are required for hypnotic responses to benzodiazepines. mice that completely lack γ <dig> had only 6% of benzodiazepine binding compared to wild type mice and were insensitive to the hypnotic effects of diazepam  <cit> . likewise, mice with a point mutation in γ <dig> that eliminated response to zolpidem eliminated the effects of this benzodiazepine site ligand  <cit> . it seems likely that the 20–40% of benzodiazepine sensitive receptors that remain in the knockdown mice are enough to mediate the hypnotic effect of benzodiazepine site ligands. this is supported by positron emission tomography studies in humans, in which only a small proportion of the benzodiazepine sites need to be occupied by lorazepam and zolpidem to induce clinical effects such as sedation  <cit> . there may thus be spare receptors that can be measured by biochemical techniques but are not needed for whole animal pharmacological effects. another hypothesis is that knockdown of γ <dig> does not result in a proportional reduction in all γ <dig> containing gabaa-rs. recent studies conducted in knockin mice with a point mutation at the benzodiazepine binding site have attributed α <dig> and α <dig> containing gabaa-rs to the mediation of benzodiazepine-induced sedation and anxiolysis, respectively  <cit> . perhaps γ <dig> knockdown mice have disproportionate decreases in non-α <dig> containing receptors, e.g., α <dig> or α <dig> containing receptor isoforms. it may be possible that in our γ <dig> knockdown mice, the number of α2βxγ <dig> gabaa-rs is greatly reduced while the number of α1βxγ <dig> receptors is not, which remains to be studied. this could be tested by immunohistochemical methods using antibodies against α <dig> and α <dig> or by testing for changes in zolpidem insensitive binding. changes in subunit trafficking may also play a role. essrich et al.  <cit>  established strong evidence that gabaa-rs are clustered at the synapse through indirect interactions between γ <dig> and gephyrin. enough clustering may remain in the knockdown mice such that drug response does not change. alternatively, synaptic clustering of gabaa-rs may not be important for behavioral responses to benzodiazepines, and it is possible that benzodiazepines potentiate the extrasynaptic gabaa-r responses determined by electrophysiology in brain slices  <cit> . it is also possible that the high variability in γ <dig> levels in the brain of knockdown mice masked any change in behavioral response to these drugs. in hindsight, it would have been useful to quantify γ <dig> levels in the same mice that were used for the behavioral sensitivity studies. it would be interesting to see if sensitivity correlated with γ <dig> levels on an individual animal basis. this type of approach could be exploited in future studies of γ <dig> receptor function. lastly, decreases in benzodiazepine binding may not directly translate into changes in in vivo insensitivity. for example, in α <dig> null mice, changes in benzodiazepine binding did not change whole animal sensitivity to midazolam but increased sensitivity to diazepam  <cit> . in contrast, in mice that selectively lack the long splice variant of γ <dig>  affinity for benzodiazepine site ligands is increased and behavioral response to the sedative effects of midazolam and zolpidem is also increased  <cit> . similarly, in mice lacking the β <dig> subunit, decreased benzodiazepine binding and decreased whole animal midazolam sensitivity were observed  <cit> . further study is required to examine these possibilities.

CONCLUSIONS
we have produced a novel genetically engineered mouse line that exhibits a reduction in γ <dig> mrna levels that is highly variable between mice  but averages ~35% of control levels. these γ <dig> knockdown mice are viable and have enhanced anxiety-like behavioral abnormalities. surprising, these mice are normally sensitive to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepine site ligands. lastly, this novel genetically engineered mouse line can also be easily converted to a γ <dig> global knockout mouse line by simply crossing to a cre-expressing global deleter transgenic mouse line.
