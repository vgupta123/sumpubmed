BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is a small, non-enveloped circular single-stranded dna virus of the family circoviridae. pcv <dig> was originally detected as a non-cytopathic contaminant of the pk- <dig> cell line, atcc-ccl <dig>  <cit> . pcv <dig> infections are widely distributed around the world as described before  <cit> . seroprevalence of pcv <dig> at herd level varies between 10%  <cit>  and 100%  <cit> . although pcv <dig> dna has been isolated from lymph nodes of a piglet in france with a wasting condition  <cit> , it is generally accepted that pcv <dig> is non-pathogenic to pigs  <cit> . experimental infections with pcv <dig> failed to reproduce disease in pigs  <cit> . the distribution of pcv <dig> in different pig tissues after experimental infections has been demonstrated  <cit> . pcv <dig> has been detected in cases of congenital tremors in newborn pigs and aborted/stillborn piglets, indicating the possible occurrence of vertical transmission of pcv <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, no evidence of pcv <dig> infection was found in piglets affected with congenital tremors in an  <dig> years retro-prospective study  <cit> . to our knowledge, nothing is known about the outcome of pcv <dig> infections in porcine foetuses.

in the present study, the virological and pathological outcomes were examined in porcine foetuses that were experimentally inoculated with pcv <dig> at  <dig> days of gestation.

methods
viruses
two different pcv <dig> strains were used in this study. the pcv <dig> cell culture strain ccl <dig>  was originally detected as a non-cytopathic contaminant of the pk- <dig> cell line  <cit> . the pcv <dig> field strain  <dig> was isolated from stillborn piglets  <cit> . both pcv <dig> strains have been sequenced and their full genomic sequences have been deposited in genbank .

experimental design
due to the high seroprevalence of pcv <dig> in flemish sows  <cit> , viral replication and pathology cannot be studied by nasal inoculation of sows during gestation or by intrauterine inoculation of sows at insemination. therefore, experimental pcv <dig> infections in foetuses have to be performed by direct in utero inoculation. three conventional pcv <dig> seropositive landrace sows were submitted to laparatomy at  <dig> days of gestation. laparotomy of the sows was performed under anaesthesia as described previously  <cit> . in each of the three sows, three foetuses were inoculated: one foetus with the pcv <dig> cell culture strain ccl33; one with the pcv <dig> field isolate  <dig> and one foetus with cell culture medium. the position in the uterus of the pcv1- and mock-inoculated foetuses, and their adjacent foetuses, is shown in table  <dig>  the inoculations were performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, the foetuses were inoculated by trans-uterine injection with  <dig> μl, containing  <dig>  tcid <dig> of pcv <dig>  into the peritoneal  and amniotic  cavities. for mock-inoculated foetuses, pk- <dig> cell culture medium  was inoculated by trans-uterine injection with  <dig> μl into the peritoneal  and amniotic  cavities. the inoculated foetuses were marked with a synthetic, non-absorbable, superficial suture  on the exterior uterine wall. antibiotics were administered to the sows before closure of the operation wound ,  <dig> ml intraperitoneally and  <dig> ml in the operation wound).

the sows were housed individually in a <dig> experimental units. the sows were observed daily for clinical signs and their rectal temperature was monitored daily during the first week after surgery. twenty-one days post inoculation , the sows were humanly euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbitalum natricum  . hysterectomy was performed and all foetuses were collected. the specific length of the tail ends of the sutures was used to determine the pcv <dig> strain the foetus was inoculated with.

all inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses were examined for gross lesions and tissue samples were collected from the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, thymus, tonsils, ileum and cerebrum for histopathological examinations , for virus titrations and for staining of infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence. serum and abdominal fluid were collected as well. the serum samples of the sows were collected prior to surgery  and at the time of euthanasia .

the animal experiments described in this study were authorized and supervised by the ethical and animal welfare committee of the faculty of veterinary medicine of ghent university.

pcv <dig> isolation and titrations
ten%  tissue suspensions  and 20%  tissue suspensions  were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline . for the pcv1-inoculated foetuses, the pcv <dig> titres in the above mentioned organs were determined by virus titration in pk- <dig> cells, as described before for pcv <dig> titration  <cit> . briefly, pcv1-infected pk- <dig> cells were revealed by immunoperoxidase staining with using an optimal dilution of mono-specific anti-pcv <dig> swine polyclonal serum  and peroxidase-labelled goat-anti-swine igg  as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. for the mock-inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses, pcv <dig> titres were determined in the heart, lungs and spleen. the titration experiments were repeated independently for  <dig> times. for 10% suspensions, the detection limit of this technique was  <dig>  tcid50/g tissue and for 20% suspensions, the detection limit was  <dig>  tcid50/g tissue.

single immunofluorescence staining
the number of pcv1-positive cells in all of the collected organs of pcv1-inoculated foetuses and in the lungs of mock-inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses was determined by an indirect immunofluorescence staining , adapted from the technique described by sanchez et al.  <cit> . methanol-fixed cryostat sections were incubated with an optimal dilution of biotin-conjugated porcine anti-pcv <dig> polyclonal antibodies . subsequently, a 1: <dig> dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate -labelled streptavidin  in pbs was applied. both incubations were performed for  <dig> h at 37°c and sections were washed three times with pbs between the incubations. finally, sections were incubated with hoechst  for  <dig> min followed by three washings with pbs. the specificity of the staining was confirmed by the deletion of primary antibody  and by the complete absence of fluorescence in the tissue sections of non-inoculated, age-matched foetuses. stained tissue sections were mounted with a glycerol solution containing  <dig> -diazobicyclo- <dig> .2-octane  anti-fading agent . the number of pcv1-positive cells was determined in an area of  <dig> mm <dig> of tissue by a leica dm/rbe fluorescence microscope  as described by sanchez et al.  <cit> . representative digital images of the stained tissue sections were made using the olympus ix <dig> microscope connected with a cell-m live-cell imaging module.

double immunofluorescence staining
to our knowledge, the target cells of pcv <dig> have not been characterized with cell markers yet. a cytokeratin marker monoclonal antibody  ae1/ae <dig>  was used to identify epithelial cells  <cit> . polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the human von willebrand factor   were used to detect endothelial cells. since pcv <dig> has previously been associated with cells showing macrophage morphology in pigs  <cit> , the macrophage-marker mab 41d <dig>  detecting porcine sialoadhesin, was used  <cit> . since mab 41d <dig> is specific for macrophages, a mab  <dig> . <dig>  was used which detects not only macrophages but also monocytes, dendritic cells and granulocytes  <cit> . mab  <dig> . <dig> directed against igm  <cit>  was used as marker for b-lymphocytes. mabs bb23-8e <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  directed against cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  respectively, were used as markers for t-lymphocytes.

a double immunofluorescence staining for epithelial cells/endothelial cells/macrophages/b-lymphocytes/t-lymphocytes and pcv <dig> was performed in the lungs of pcv1-inoculated foetuses, adapted from the technique described by sanchez et al.  <cit> . briefly, methanol-fixed cryostat sections were first incubated with mab ae1/ae <dig> , pab vwf , mab 41d <dig> , mab anti-swc <dig> , mab anti-igm , mab anti-cd <dig> , mab anti-cd <dig>  or mab anti-cd <dig>  and then with fitc-labelled goat-anti-mouse igg   or fitc-labelled goat-anti-rabbit igg  . afterwards, the sections were stained for pcv <dig> antigens by incubation with an optimal dilution of biotin-conjugated porcine anti-pcv <dig> pabs. subsequently, a 1: <dig> dilution of texas red-labelled streptavidin  in pbs was added. all antibodies were diluted in pbs and all incubations were performed for  <dig> h at 37°c. the sections were washed three times with pbs after each incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. specificity of the staining for different cell markers  was demonstrated using an irrelevant, isotype matched mab 1c <dig>  3h <dig> and 13d <dig>  <cit>  and by the deletion of primary antibodies , and by the complete absence of pcv1-specific fluorescence in tissue sections of non-inoculated, age-matched foetuses. the stained tissue sections were mounted as described above and pcv1-positive cells and double positive cells  were quantitated as described previously  <cit>  by using a leica dm/rbe fluorescence microscope . representative digital images of stained preparations were made using the olympus ix <dig> microscope connected with a cell-m live-cell imaging module.

amplification of the pcv <dig> rep gene and sequencing
dna was extracted from the heart and lung tissues of pcv1-inoculated, mock-inoculated and their adjacent foetuses by using a nucleospinr tissue kit . a set of primers  was used to amplify a pcv <dig>  <dig> bp replicase gene  fragment following the same methods as described by larochelle et al.  <cit> . pcr products  were treated with exonuclease i and antarctic phosphatase  and used directly for cycle sequencing with a big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit v <dig>  . the cycle sequencing reaction products were purified using ethanol precipitation and separated on an abi genetic analyzer  <dig> . sequence alignments were performed using bl2seq at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. to confirm the absence of porcine circovirus type  <dig>  in pcv1-inoculated foetuses, amplification of pcv <dig> capsid was performed with the heart and lung tissues as described previously in saha et al.  <cit> .

serology
the pcv1-specific antibody titres in serum were determined by an immuno-peroxidase monolayer assay  as described previously  <cit> . the pcv <dig> cell culture strain ccl <dig> was used as antigen. the foetuses were also checked for pcv2-specific antibodies by ipma as described above but with pcv <dig> strain  <dig>  <cit>  as antigen. these assays were independently repeated  <dig> times.

the sow antibody titres against pcv <dig>  pcv <dig> and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  were determined by an ipma  and the sow antibody titres against porcine parvovirus  were determined by a haemagglutination inhibition  test as described elsewhere  <cit> .

RESULTS
evaluation of the sows
the three sows were clinically healthy during the whole study period. no rise of rectal temperature was noticed in any of the three sows. the operation wounds were slightly swollen until  <dig> hours after the operations and somewhat painful at palpation. the pcv1- and pcv2-specific ipma ab titres of the three sows ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively in pre-serum and were identical in post-serum. the prrsv-specific ipma ab titres and ppv-specific hi ab titres in the pre-serum ranged from <  <dig> to  <dig> and from <  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. seroconversion against prrsv and ppv was not observed in any of the three sows.

gross examinations
all pcv1-inoculated foetuses were normal in appearance and no evidence of gross pathological lesions was observed in any of the pcv1-inoculated foetuses . the mock-inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses were also normal in appearance and no gross pathology was observed.

microscopic examinations
a haematoxylin and eosin  staining was performed for different organs  of pcv1-inoculated and mock-inoculated foetuses. microscopic lesions including severe haemorrhages in the interlobular regions were observed in the lung tissue of two foetuses  inoculated with the cell culture pcv <dig> strain, ccl <dig> . microscopic lesions were not present in the other organs of these two foetuses. microscopic lesions could not be observed in the third ccl33-inoculated foetus, the three 3384-inoculated foetuses and the mock-inoculated foetuses.

pcv <dig> isolation and titrations
high pcv <dig> titres were found in the lungs of the foetuses s1r <dig> , s2r <dig>  and s3r <dig>  inoculated with the cell culture strain ccl <dig>  all other organs of ccl33-inoculated foetuses were negative  by virus titration. all collected organs from the 3384-inoculated foetuses were negative  by virus titration. mock-inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses were negative for pcv <dig> 

single immunofluorescence staining
the number of pcv1-positive cells in the lungs of the three ccl33-inoculated foetuses, i.e. s1r <dig>  s2r <dig> and s3r <dig>  were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cells/ <dig> mm <dig>  respectively . a low number of pcv1-positive cells/ <dig> mm <dig> was observed in the lungs of the three foetuses inoculated with the field strain  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cells/ <dig> mm <dig> respectively). pcv1-positive cells were also observed in several other organs such as spleen, liver ; spleen, liver and tonsils ; and heart and thymus  and the numbers varied between  <dig> and  <dig> cells/ <dig> mm <dig> of tissues . pcv1-positive cells were not observed in the lungs of the mock-inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses.

a foetuses were identified by their position in the uterus. r = right horn. numbering is in sequence from ovary to cervix.

na: not available; -: no positive cells detected

double immunofluorescence staining 
the pcv <dig> antigens were mainly  localized in the epithelial cells of the lungs  of the pcv1-inoculated foetuses. the other 3% of the pcv <dig> antigens were localized in swc3+ cells  of the lungs . no co-localization of pcv <dig> antigens was observed in endothelial cells, 41d3+ macrophages, b-lymphocytes and t-lymphocytes .

amplification of pcv <dig> rep gene and sequencing
in order to confirm that the foetuses had been inoculated with the specific pcv <dig> strain and were not contaminated with pcv <dig> from neighbouring foetuses , a pcv <dig> rep fragment was amplified using heart and/or lung tissue from the infected foetuses  followed by sequencing. pcr and dna sequencing recovered ccl <dig> and  <dig> sequences from ccl33- and 3384-inoculated foetuses, respectively. no evidence for mixed samples  was found. all the adjacent foetuses of pcv1-inoculated foetuses were negative in pcr assays. all the mock-inoculated foetuses and their adjacent foetuses were also negative in pcr assays . all the pcv1-inoculated foetuses were also negative for pcv <dig> in pcr assays.

serology
all the pcv1-inoculated foetuses had a very low anti-pcv <dig> ipma ab titre of  <dig> to  <dig>  except one foetus  inoculated with ccl <dig>  which had a titre of  <dig>  the mock-inoculated and non-inoculated foetuses were negative  for pcv1-specific ipma ab. all the pcv1-inoculated and mock-inoculated foetuses were negative  for pcv2-specific ipma ab.

discussion
in this study, the virological and pathological outcomes were examined in immuno-incompetent porcine foetuses after inoculation with pcv <dig> at  <dig> days of gestation.

the pcv <dig> cell culture strain ccl <dig> was found to be pathogenic to porcine foetuses inoculated at 55-days of foetal life. severe haemorrhages were present in the lungs of two out of three ccl <dig> inoculated foetuses. these lesions correlated well with the highest pcv <dig> titres  in the lungs. the lungs with the lower level of virus replication  did not have histopathological changes. haemorrhages in the lungs can be explained by the fact that due to the high pcv <dig> replication in the epithelial cells, there might be the release of inflammatory mediators, which may ultimately lead to the increased permeability of the blood vessels followed by leakage of blood or haemorrhage. under the conditions of the present study, the pcv <dig> field strain  <dig> was non-pathogenic to porcine foetuses. this suggests that a high pcv <dig> load could be essential to induce pathology in porcine foetuses. several experimental studies had been performed in the past to study the pathogenesis of pcv <dig> infections in 1-day old, 2-days-old,  <dig> month old and  <dig> months old pigs  <cit>  but these experimental studies failed to reproduce disease in pigs. however, under the conditions of the present study, it was demonstrated that pcv <dig> is pathogenic for porcine foetuses. more research is needed to determine the pathogenicity of pcv <dig> 

previously, allan et al.  <cit>  showed the distribution of pcv <dig> antigens by virus isolation and iif staining in different organs of pigs, to be predominantly in the lungs, although the level of pcv <dig> replication was not quantitatively determined in that study. our study showed that the lung tissue was the main target organ of replication of ccl <dig> strain, as this pcv <dig> strain could only be isolated with high titres  from the lungs. the field strain  <dig> could not be isolated from any of the inoculated foetuses, although they were clearly pcr positive. these findings show that the replication kinetics of the strains ccl <dig> and  <dig> are different from each other. sequence comparison of the rep and capsid of ccl <dig> and  <dig> revealed one synonymous nucleotide substitution in the rep and  <dig> amino acid  differences  in the capsid protein , suggesting that these aa differences in the capsid protein could be responsible for the different replication kinetics of these two strains in porcine foetuses. further research may clarify this issue.

single immunofluorescence staining revealed that moderate  and low numbers  of pcv <dig> positive cells were present in the lungs of the ccl33-inoculated and the 3384-inoculated foetuses, respectively, although no pcv <dig> could be isolated from the lungs of the 3384-inoculated foetuses. moreover, all the other organs of the pcv1-inoculated foetuses were negative in virus isolation, whereas pcv <dig> antigens were found at a low level  in the heart, liver, spleen, thymus and tonsils. these results suggest that immunostaining of pcv <dig> is a more sensitive technique than virus isolation and titration for the detection of pcv <dig>  comparably, a previous study of mcneilly et al.  <cit>  with pcv <dig> indicated that immunostaining of pcv <dig> is a more sensitive technique than virus isolation for the detection of pcv <dig> in porcine tissues.

the double staining of pcv <dig> and different cell markers established that the pcv <dig> antigens were mainly localized in the lung epithelial cells and not in endothelial cells, macrophages or lymphocytes of the lungs of pcv1-inoculated foetuses. this is in contradiction with previous observations in new-born piglets  <cit> , where it was shown that pcv <dig> is mainly present in non-epithelial cells, morphologically resembling macrophages. it could be possible that the target cells for pcv <dig> in foetal life might be different from the target cells for pcv <dig> in newborn pigs, as previously shown for pcv <dig> by sanchez et al.  <cit> . pcv <dig> needs cellular dna polymerases of actively dividing cells to replicate  <cit>  and presumably epithelial cell types possess more mitotic activity in immuno-incompetent porcine foetuses than in newborn pigs. the remaining 3% of the pcv <dig> antigens were localized in swc3+ cells, which were 41d3-. it could be possible that due to high pcv <dig> replication in the lungs, there were newly infiltrating monocytes . this study also indicates that pcv <dig> and pcv <dig> have different cell tropism during foetal life, since pcv <dig> replicates mainly in the cardiomyocytes and macrophages of the heart tissue  <cit>  and pcv <dig> targets mainly the epithelial cells of the lungs.

in previous studies with pcv <dig>  <cit> , it was shown that pcv <dig> does not spread rapidly from one foetus to another. under the conditions of the present study, no intrauterine spread of pcv <dig> from pcv1-inoculated to non-inoculated foetuses was observed. immuno-competency in porcine foetuses develops at around  <dig> days of gestation  <cit> . more specifically, porcine foetuses are able to mount a protective immune response against small, non-enveloped, single-stranded dna viruses like pcv <dig>  pcv <dig> or ppv when they are infected after  <dig> days of gestation  <cit> . foetuses were inoculated with pcv <dig> strains at  <dig> days of foetal life and their immune response to pcv <dig> was confirmed by determining the pcv1-specific ipma ab titre. all pcv1-inoculated foetuses developed very low anti-pcv <dig> antibody titres , except one foetus, which had a titre of  <dig> that was inoculated with ccl <dig> strain.

CONCLUSIONS
from this study, it can be concluded that pcv <dig> can replicate and may produce pathology in the lungs of porcine foetuses inoculated at 55-days of foetal life. more research is needed to confirm the pathogenic character of pcv <dig> for porcine foetuses.
