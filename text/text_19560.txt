BACKGROUND
the filamentous fungus aspergillus nidulans is a model organism for many aspects of cell biology and genetics. additionally, the aspergilli themselves include fungi of biomedical, agricultural and industrial significance . thus it is important to extend our understanding of a. nidulans to facilitate analysis of key processes which underpin fungal pathogenicity and biotechnological applications. the a. nidulans genome was sequenced and annotated in  <dig>  <cit>  and the genome annotation has been updated several times since then. it is among a relatively large number of sequenced aspergillus genomes, genomic data for which are accessible via a number of public web resources . despite this wealth of data and manual curation efforts  <cit> , genome annotations are largely based upon computational gene model predictions which may be inaccurate, a particular problem for complex genes containing multiple introns.

new sequencing technologies allow high-throughput sequencing of transcripts   <cit> . these data can be used to detect differential gene expression among different populations of cells, verify or correct gene models and identify previously unannotated transcribed regions of the genome. these include genes bound for translation as well as untranslated  transcripts  that play important functional roles. families of ncrna include ‘housekeeping’ molecules such as transfer rna , ribosomal rna , spliceosomal rna and small nuclear and small nucleolar rna . they also include ncrna with putative regulatory roles such as small interfering rna , micro rna  and long ncrna. the latter group include antisense transcripts which may be common in eukaryote transcriptomes  <cit> , potentially playing roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . rna-seq has been applied to several aspergillus species to show transcriptional responses to: biofilm growth in a. fumigatus <cit> ; growth on lignocellulose and germination of conidia in a. niger; and temperature changes and 5-azacytidine in a. flavus <cit> . these and other studies  <cit>  have also explored aspergillus transcriptomes more generally and improved genome annotation.

knowledge of the precise position of a transcript’s 5′ end provides valuable data for gene annotation by defining the transcription start site  and thereby both the 5′ untranslated region  and upstream promoter region of the respective gene. this allows the identification of functionally important sequence elements that may then be analysed directly or in silico. however, the 5′ end of a transcript is difficult to distinguish accurately from whole transcriptome rna-seq data due to uneven read coverage and bias in libraries leading to a low frequency of sequence reads from transcript ends  <cit> . several methods to define the 5′ ends of transcripts have been described, using different sequencing technologies and with varying levels of throughput .

here, we describe both the strand specific sequencing of the whole transcriptome of a. nidulans and the specific sequencing of transcript 5′ ends. the latter was achieved by adapting 5′ rate . by varying the pre-treatment of rna we were able to specifically sequence capped, uncapped or both capped and uncapped transcripts. the sequencing of transcript 5’ ends led to the identification of over  <dig> transcription start sites across the genome and these were used to investigate common features associated with transcription sites and promoters, including the identification of novel motifs. we found many cases of antisense transcription of protein coding genes , as well as modest levels of alternative splicing of transcripts . the occurrence of differential splicing and antisense transcripts were confirmed for specific transcripts and the regulatory role of one antisense transcript for the transcription factor meab, investigated. these data have assisted in genome annotation, including the identification of novel genes: we estimate that the total gene number for a. nidulans is approximately  <dig> , over  <dig> more than had previously been annotated. these data have been made available to the aspergillus genome database  to facilitate on-going gene annotation and can be visualised via their genome browser.

RESULTS
whole transcriptome sequencing of aspergillus nidulans
to obtain an accurate representation of the a. nidulans transcriptome, we performed high-throughput rna-sequencing of the wild-type strain g <dig> under a range of growth conditions  <cit> . of  <dig> , <dig> reads  <dig> , <dig>  mapped to the reference genome, the majority mapping to only one position.  <dig> % of the reference genome assembly was covered by at least one sequence read. mapping statistics are shown in additional file  <dig> 

the cadre genome assembly release  <dig> has  <dig> annotated loci with unique identifiers. of these,  <dig> had an annotated coding sequence, indicating the translated region of a protein coding gene. the remainder consisted of putative pseudogenes and non-coding rna genes. for all  <dig> annotated loci, the number of mapped reads from each sequence library which aligned in the sense and antisense orientations were counted. these counts were normalised by library and locus size to give the standardised measure of expression ‘reads per kilobase per million mapped reads’ . these data are shown in additional file  <dig>  across the five libraries, 94% of annotated loci had at least one read aligned in the sense orientation and 79% had rpkm >  <dig> , indicating that the majority  are expressed under the growth conditions analysed.

identification and analysis of novel transcripts
the transcriptome alignment was used to define transcribed regions of the genome . using the merged data from all five libraries  <dig>  transcribed fragments were defined. this is four times greater than the number of annotated loci. a proportion of these may relate to unanotated loci. however, multiple small fragments can be inferred from what is in fact one transcript due to uneven mapping; a particular problem if the transcript is expressed at a low level. additionally, alternative splicing may produce multiple transcripts from the same locus.

to estimate the number of putative novel transcripts in the genome, the locations of the  <dig>  transcribed regions were compared to the annotated loci. 29%  did not overlap an annotated locus in either direction. on average these were shorter than transcribed fragments that overlapped annotated loci . the proportion of the transcribed genome associated with these novel transcripts was  <dig> %. assuming annotated and unannotated genes have a similar length distribution, these data suggest that the  <dig>  annotated loci represent approximately 92% of all loci. the genome should therefore contain approximately  <dig> additional transcripts not included in the cadre release  <dig> annotation.

to further analyse these unannotated loci, we searched for similarities to known functional non-coding rnas or protein domains. to identify functional non-coding rnas, the nucleotide sequences of the  <dig>  putatively novel transcribed fragments were used to query the rfam database  <cit> . to identify unannotated protein coding genes, we used all open reading frames longer than 300 bp  within these transcripts  to query the pfam database  <cit> .  <dig> transcripts had at least one match to the pfam or rfam database, the results are shown in additional file  <dig>  a few putative functional rnas were identified, among them several trnas, small nucleolar rnas and spliceosomal rnas. many protein domains were also identified. since this analysis, many of these genes have been added to later releases of the annotation, in some cases guided by these data. putative transcripts that remain unannotated at the time of writing include those encoding putative methyltransferase and p <dig> domains, as well as numerous dde domains often associated with transposons.

introns and alternative splicing
the transcriptome alignment identified  <dig>  introns supported by one or more sequence reads . the cadre release  <dig> annotation contained  <dig>  annotated introns, of which  <dig>   were confirmed by the transcriptome data.  <dig> introns matched the annotated intron only at its 5′ junction and  <dig> only at its 3′ junction, while  <dig> overlapped an annotated intron without matching either junction.  <dig> did not in any way correspond to an annotated intron.

introns are generally short  but some long introns do exist. for example, an annotated intron of approximately  <dig>  kb in gene an <dig> was confirmed by rna-seq and validated by rt-pcr .  <dig>  introns had bases gt and ag at their 5’ and 3′ ends,  <dig> had at and ac and  <dig> had gc and ag. the gt-ag introns showed standard consensus sequences at their 5′ and 3′ ends: gtraagt  with conserved ag  immediately upstream at the 5′ end and yag  at the 3′ end. in all,  <dig>  introns were fully contained within  <dig> annotated genes.  <dig> introns extended  <dig> annotated genes at the 5′ end.  <dig> introns extended  <dig> annotated genes at the 3′ end.  <dig> introns apparently completely spanned  <dig> annotated loci . of these  <dig> loci, six were snornas and two were  <dig> s rrna. the remaining four were putative protein coding genes, but the long introns could not be confirmed by rt-pcr . careful examination of these loci suggests that the introns are likely to represent mapping artefacts due to the respective genes being flanked by similar trna genes.

alternative splicing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome without the need for additional genomic sequence. a small number of examples of alternative splicing have been described in the aspergilli . whole transcriptome analysis of a. oryzae  reported  <dig> % of genes displaying differential splicing with the majority of these events  being due to intron retention  <cit> .

we searched for cases of alternative splicing by comparing transcripts defined by the cufflinks program. table  <dig> summarises the data from additional file  <dig>  based on these data, the proportion of alternatively spliced transcripts is low  and is broadly similar to that reported for a. oryzae <cit> . we searched for cases of exon skipping/retention  but found only  <dig> examples of this pattern, indicating that it is rare. three of these cases were confirmed by rt-pcr : an <dig>  an <dig> and an <dig>  we observed that many of the cases of alternative splicing involved intron retention, similar to the case in a. oryzae.table  <dig>

we observed an extreme example of alternative splicing on chromosome v. this transcript spanned three annotated loci: a putative pseudogene, a putative protein coding gene  and a snorna. the putative protein coding gene was not supported by the data  but the snorna corresponded to a peak of high read coverage. the transcript was unusual in that it contained seven introns each with a peak of high read coverage within it. the alignment indicated alternative splicing with both exon skipping and retention, which were confirmed by rt-pcr. searches of rfam indicated that the intra-intron peaks were indeed snornas and the locus appears to be a snorna cluster similar to that described in neurospora crassa <cit> . figure 1b illustrates the observed alternative splicing. we could not reconstruct an open reading frame from the exon sequences, suggesting that the function of the transcript is as a precursor to fully processed snornas and the processed mature transcripts may not have an additional functional role.

natural antisense transcripts 
inspection of the a. nidulans transcriptome data revealed a large proportion of genes with strand-specific reads aligned in both the sense and antisense orientations, indicating the existence of many natural antisense transcripts. these represent a subset of non-coding rnas  <cit>  with potential regulatory roles mediated via various mechanisms including transcriptional interference, chromatin remodelling, rna interference and translational repression  <cit> . examples have previously been identified in a. flavus and a. niger <cit> .

loci with sequence reads mapping in the antisense orientation were relatively common, with 72% having at least  <dig> mapped read, compared to 94% of loci in the sense orientation . however, in the antisense orientation only 14% of annotated genes had an rpkm >  <dig>  compared to 74% in the sense orientation. this indicates that antisense transcripts are expressed at a much lower level than its sense counterpart and/or that they cover only a part of a given gene.

to describe the distribution of antisense transcription across genes, we counted antisense reads aligned to the 5′, central and 3′ regions of each annotated gene. of the 72% of genes  with one or more reads mapped in the antisense orientation under one or more growth conditions ,  <dig> showed 5′-biased and  <dig> centrally-biased antisense transcription, but the majority,  <dig>  showed 3′ bias. this excess of antisense transcription at the 3′ end of genes is consistent with previous findings in saceromycese cerevisieae <cit> .

using rt-pcr with oligo dt in combination with gene specific primers we experimentally verified antisense transcripts overlapping four genes: an <dig>  an <dig>  an <dig> and an <dig>  pcr products were cloned and sequenced, confirming the presence of each of the previously unannotated transcripts in the antisense configuration with a known gene.

we investigated one example of antisense rna in more detail. the transcription factor meab  has a regulatory role associated with nitrogen availability  <cit> . examination of rna-seq data revealed an antisense transcript which initiates at a position aligned to the first intron of the sense transcript. the intron sequence, which is relatively long at 331 bp compared to a median intron length of 59 bp, contains six gata motifs, indicating a possible functional association with a second transcription factor, area  <cit> , which has been shown to regulate meab transcript levels  <cit> . to confirm the presence of the antisense transcript and test the possibility that it is under the regulation of area, we utilised northern analysis using a single stranded probe from exon  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the antisense transcript is differentially regulated in response to nitrogen regime and its expression is dependent on functional area. to investigate the function of the meab antisense transcript we specifically deleted the first intron of meab by homolgous integration at the meab locus. northern analysis revealed that modulation of meab transcript levels was largely lost, except under nitrogen starvation . we also found that a strain disrupted for three loci potentially involved in rnai  <cit>  did not show significant altered regulation of meab transcript levels, indicating that rnai is not responsible for antisense mediated regulation of meab.figure  <dig>

+, glutamine , alanine  as sole nitrogen source or nitrogen starvation , for two hours. analysis of a strain bearing a loss of function mutation in area  revealed that meab-as expression is area dependent. 18s rrna was used as a control.  quantitative northern analysis of the meab sense transcript  in the wild type , area <dig>  meabΔintron and Δrnai strains was undertaken. the mean intensity, relative to wt, of four independent experiments is plotted . downregulation of meab transcript levels in response to poor nitrogen  was lost in the meabΔintron strain but the response to nitrogen starvation was retained.



identification of transcription start sites and analysis of 5′ untranslated regions and promoters
in order to further characterise the a. nidulans transcriptome and help improve gene annotation, we constructed rna-seq libraries enriched for 5′ tss, utilising an approach based on 5′ rate  <cit> . the mrna was decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase  prior to ligation of adapters to the unfragmented rna and reverse transcription, using a primer containing a random hexonuleotide sequence at its 3′ end. the products were size selected, amplified by pcr and sequenced using the conventional solid protocol. the resulting 5′ nucleotide position of each read, here referred to as the ‘read head’ , was mapped to the genome assembly and the number of read heads at each position counted, peaks representing putative 5′ ends of transcripts.

the initial 5′ sequencing library  consisted of  <dig> , <dig> reads, of which  <dig> , <dig>  mapped uniquely to the reference genome . inspection of the sequence alignment showed a high frequency of rh mapping close to the 5′ ends of annotated genes, indicating successful 5′ enrichment. additionally, widespread low level mapping was observed, possibly due to the sequencing of fragmented and partially degraded transcripts. to assess this we made a library in which the mrna was pre-treated with alkaline phosphatase  prior to decapping, in order to prevent fragmented or degraded rna from ligating to the 5′ pcr primer. additionally we made a library without pre-treatment of the rna with tap, thus eliminating capped mrna from the sequence library. in the untreated library, low levels of reads were distributed throughout the transcribed regions with no peaks generally observed at the 5′ ends of annotated genes. some peaks of high coverage were evident in the untreated library. these were often associated with the 5′ ends of putative snornas . in contrast, tap-treated libraries showed discontinuous read distributions with peaks of coverage commonly occurring upstream of annotated genes . the accuracy of the transcript 5′ end mapping was assessed by comparing it with circularisation rt-pcr or 5′ race data, which specifically defines the 5′ ends of transcripts. this analysis showed agreement between the methods, as illustrated in figure 3b.figure  <dig> 
5′-specific rna-seq locates transcription start sites.  coverage depth of 5′-specific rna-seq libraries . peaks and dotted lines indicate the transcription start sites of two annotated genes: an <dig> and an <dig>   experimental validation of 5′-specific rna-seq data. the x-axis indicates the distance  upstream of the translation initiation codon atg for three genes: h2a.z , gdha  and uaz . for each gene, the proportion of rna-seq reads starting at a given position is plotted above the line and the approximate proportion of 30– <dig> sanger-sequenced plasmids containing products of circularisation rt-pcr supporting a given tss is potted below the line.



for further analysis, to maximise the depth of coverage and identify as many putative tss as possible, the four tap-treated libraries  were combined. using a region of 121 bp containing a minimum of  <dig> rh and a minimum major peak of  <dig> rh, we defined  <dig> putative transcription start site regions. we developed a metric to measure the distribution of reads across each tss region, based on a confidence interval around the major tss . this was used to define three sets of tss regions. the first contained  <dig> putative transcription start sites with a very tight distribution or strong single start site where the 95% confidence interval was within two nucleotides. the second contained  <dig> less specific single start sites . the third contained the  <dig> most diffuse tss . of the tight, intermediate and diffuse tss regions,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were within 500 bp upstream of annotated genes. conversely,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %%  occurred fully within annotated genes, suggested that the tight tss regions are likely to be enriched for real tss. however, the diffuse tss regions might include a proportion of artefacts arising from degradation of mrna. all putative promoters are recorded in additional file  <dig> and all identified tss located within 500 bp of the 5′ end of an annotated gene and in the correct orientation are listed in additional file  <dig>  according to our classification of tss,  <dig> ‘tight’ ,  <dig> ‘intermediate’ and  <dig> ‘diffuse’ putative tss were associated with annotated genes.

the association of specific gene functions with different classes of promoter was investigated. figure  <dig> shows the proportion of each of the three gene sets assigned a broad functional description. genes associated with ‘tight’ tss are enriched for functions related to translation and ribosome biogenesis, with genes associated with diffuse tss tend to be enriched for regulatory processes and signal transduction. the full table of go terms significantly enriched for each gene set is in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

to define the length of 5′ utrs, the distance from each defined transcription start site to the nearest downstream annotated translation start codon  was plotted . the majority of ‘tight’ tss were followed by a 5′ utr of less than 100 bp . however, a proportion of genes with long 5′ utr would not be detected here, as we set a maximum distance of 500 bp from tss to translation start codon to minimise false positive results. for the more diffuse tss, the distribution 5′ utr length was much broader . to characterise upstream promoter regions, we analysed regions 200 bp upstream and 25 bp downstream of the putative tss. figure  <dig> shows the base composition and figure  <dig> the dinucleotide composition of these regions for the  <dig> ‘tight’ tss . the plots indicates that base and dinucleotide composition is skewed within approximately 75 bp immediately upstream of the tss, indicating that functional elements of the core promoter may lie within this region. further upstream  showed no major skewed base/dinucleotide frequencies . the major features that can be discerned include a c-rich region extending approximately from position - <dig> to - <dig> and a generally pyrimidine -rich region spanning the tss from - <dig> to at least position + <dig>  immediately upstream of the tss, c is the most common nucleotide , followed by t, a and g . at the tss itself, a is the most common base , followed by g, c and t . reflecting this, ca is the most frequent dinucleotide spanning the tss , followed by ta, tg and cg . all other dinucleotides here are each at less than 5% frequency. other peaks include tt/tc approximately -10 bp upstream of the tss and an a and t rich peak in the region approximately - <dig> to -30 bp upstream of the tss, which may represent the site of the tata box.figure  <dig>

to identify functional motifs in the upstream promoter regions, we searched for statistically over-represented strings of bases within the promoters of tight, intermediate and diffuse tss using the program ymf  <cit> . similar results were obtained from the program meme   <cit> . the full results from ymf are shown in additional file  <dig>  from this analysis, we identified a large number of variants on three common sequences: cacgtg, accgcc and cctnagg. we investigated the distribution of these motifs relative to the  <dig> ‘tight’ tss  and each was clearly not uniform  occurring primarily more than 50 bp upstream of the tss. the marked non-random distribution of these putative motifs relative to the tss suggests that their location is relevant to their function. our analysis of enriched motifs did not identify known core promoter motifs such as the tata box  so we searched for this motif individually in the promoter regions . the distribution of putative tata box motifs was strongly positionally specific, with the majority occurring 30–45 bp upstream of the tss, consistent with the skewed a and t frequencies in this region. we also searched for motifs including the cat box , initiator element , heat shock elements   <cit>  and regulatory motifs bound by crea   <cit>  and area   <cit> . their positions were generally much less well defined than for the other motifs although the inr and cat box tended to be more common near to the tss while the crea and area motifs tended to be more common between - <dig> and - <dig> .figure  <dig>

to further validate the putative motifs cacgtg, cctnagg and accgcc, we investigated whether they were conserved among the distantly related species aspergillus nidulans and aspergillus fumigatus. we defined  <dig> orthologue pairs between the two species and utilising chi-squared analysis determined if co-occurrence in orthologous promoters was significant. for all three motifs this was the case . this is consistent with all three motifs being functionally conserved. sequence alignment of upstream regions for orthologous genes from multiple species also illustrates the phylogenetic conservation of motifs .figure  <dig>

discussion
we carried out sequencing of both the whole transcriptome and transcript 5′ ends from the filamentous fungus a. nidulans using five different growth conditions. combining these two methods provides a useful way to define transcript structure and to improve genome annotation.

we observed that at least 80% of the reference genome assembly was transcribed across all five conditions tested. while these proportions should be treated with some caution as they are sensitive to factors such incomplete sampling by smaller sequence libraries, such effects will lead to underestimation so we may still conclude that the majority of the genome is transcribed. furthermore, this will inevitably be extended when further growth regimes are examined. the developmental state of the cultures was not measured but some growth conditions, particularly nitrogen starvation, can induce sporulation in submerged cultures  <cit> . our data suggest that this is the case, as brla and several other genes up-regulated during condia formation  <cit>  appear to be upregulated in cells under long term nitrogen starvation . this may in part explain why more of the genome  appears to be transcribed under nitrogen starvation compared to other conditions . however, for all conditions, more than 50% of the genome was transcribed. the annotated protein coding portion of the genome is approximately 50%, indicating a large amount of functional non-coding rna in addition to this . in this, a. nidulans resembles s. cerevisiae, in which approximately 75% of the genome encodes proteins but 85% of the genome is transcribed  <cit> . more extreme pervasive transcription is displayed by mammalian genomes , in which the difference between protein coding sequence  and total transcribed sequence  far exceeds that seen in the more gene-dense fungi.

updating and improvement of the a. nidulans genome annotation is an ongoing process and combining whole transcriptome sequencing with 5′ specific rna-seq data can help to improve gene annotation. as an example, a gene which had been mis-annotated as two separate loci was identified due to the occurrence of only a single tss and identification of previously unannotated introns . to aid the annotation process, the rna-seq data were made available to the research community via the cadre and aspgd websites  <cit> . at aspgd, read alignments can be viewed  and the data have been used to update many of the gene model annotations on aspgd . consequently, the current aspgd annotation has changed considerably since that analysed here. for instance, we found many putative unannotated protein genes in our analysis and estimated that the total number of transcribed genes is close to  <dig>  . many of these putative genes have since been annotated.figure  <dig> 
gene annotation improvement guided by rna-seq. example of a correction of misannotated gene models. in the cadre release  <dig> annotation two genes, an <dig> and an <dig>  were predicted . whole transcriptome  and 5′-specific rna-seq  revealed the general structure of transcripts produced in this region. whole transcriptome coverage identified four introns in the region covering the two genes , two previously unidentified introns extended an <dig>  5′-specific sequencing identified a single 5′ end for both annotated genes . the combined data indicates a single gene .



transcriptome complexity was extended by many examples of alternative splicing. predominantly this involved intron retention which we found generally resulted to the inclusion of an in-frame stop codon into the transcript. therefore, we hypothesise that intron retention is not primarily a means of generating novel proteins, but is linked to repression of translation. this could be achieved by rapid nonsense mediated decay of transcripts containing premature stop codons  <cit> , or intron retention could prevent export of the transcript from the nucleus  <cit> .

we observed many instances of natural antisense transcripts . nats are potentially functional long non-coding rnas that may regulate protein expression via a number of possible mechanisms: transcriptional interference, chromatin remodelling, and double-stranded rna formation leading to translational repression, rnai or disrupting mrna maturation and processing. a number of transcriptome analyses have identified nats in fungi  <cit> . up to 90% of s. cerevisiae genes show some level of antisense transcription and the pattern of antisense transcription appears to be evolutionarily conserved among multiple yeast species, suggesting an important conserved gene regulatory mechanism  <cit> . in a. nidulans we found that 72% of genes have at least some antisense transcription, with 14% showing this to be relatively abundant . despite the importance of antisense transcripts suggested by this ubiquity and conservation, validated examples of antisense mediated regulation are limited, although artificial antisense constructs have been used to knock down gene expression in various species including a. nidulans <cit> . in this respect we have presented data for the meab loci, which supports the model whereby the antisense transcript is upregulated when the sense transcript is repressed and that elimination of the antisense transcript leads to loss of this transcriptional regulation. with regards to the regulatory mechanism involved in this case we found that disruption of the genes associated with rnai  <cit>  did not have an impact on meab transcript levels. from our data in relation to meab there is no evidence for splicing being affected. it is interesting to note that the orthologous gene in fusarium fujikuroi, has a similar, relatively large intron containing gata motifs and a functional promoter  <cit> . in this case the resulting short transcript, which is not likely to code a functional protein, is also upregulated under nitrogen limitation but is transcribed in the sense and not the antisense direction. the apparent functional conservation would possibly support chromatin structure playing a key role in this regulatory mechanism.

the prevalence of antisense transcripts has important consequences when monitoring gene transcription. conventional northern or quantitative pcr  approaches do not take this into account, although in the case of northerns it is likely that the different forms of transcript identified by a probe will be distinguished on the basis of size. however, qpcr will generally not distinguish between sense and antisense unless the primers are specifically designed to avoid antisense transcripts on the basis of location or splicing patterns. as the sense transcript and antisense can be differentially regulated, very significant errors in calculating transcript levels may result as a consequence.

5′-specific rna-seq allowed us to identify a large number of putative transcription start sites. a range of patterns of tss distribution was seen, from tightly defined tss with a single, well supported position to more diffuse collections of individually less well supported tss. the occurrence of multiple distinct tss, and consequent 5′ heterogeneity, has been described in many eukaryotic organisms, including fungi . we divided putative tss into three groups: ‘tight’ , ‘intermediate’ and ‘diffuse’, based on the distribution of reads. rna polymerase ii-dependant promoters of vertebrates have previously been divided into two groups, categorised as either tata or cpg types, the former with a tight tss a strict distance from the tata box and the latter with broad clusters of tss  <cit> . the drosophila melanogaster genome has both tight and broad tss clusters, tight promoters appear to be enriched for core promoter elements such as the tata-box, however drosophila lacks cpg islands, therefore its broad promoters are not cpg-associated  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana the tata promoter is also associated with sharp tss clusters  <cit> . in our analysis of a. nidulans, we found putative tata-box motifs  upstream of 21% of ‘tight’ tss, 17% of ‘intermediate’ tss and 11% of ‘diffuse’ tss, approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the start site, suggesting some enrichment in tight promoters.

to analyse the core promoter regions, we focused our study on  <dig> well defined ‘tight’ tss. the core promoter serves as the site of organization of the basal transcription machinery, including rna polymerase ii. based on the defined transcription start sites, we analysed upstream regions to characterise these putative promoters. based on the skewed distribution of nucleotides, we suggest that the promoter regions are quite restricted, commonly extending no further than 75 bp upstream of the transcription start site. this is consistent with the relatively small intergenic regions of a. nidulans, compared to, for instance, mammalian genomes. these core promoters are generally enriched for pyrimidines  and an a and t rich region between - <dig> and - <dig> may represent the tata box. the pyrimdine rich sense strand upstream of the tss has been noted previously  <cit> . most strikingly the tss are commonly defined by the dinucleotide ca , with a as the first base of the transcript. there are no universal core promoter motifs identified in eukaryotes, but some, such as the tata box, are present in 30-40% of promoters in higher eukaryotes. the tata box and initiator  element tend to have a relatively fixed location upstream of genes  <cit> . although neither of these elements were identified by de novo analysis of promoter sequences based on motif enrichment they did show distinct distributions which are indicative of their functional role within promoters and also supports validity of our data.

we identified a small number of putative core motifs that were over-represented in promoters and showed a strong, significant bias in their location upstream of the tss. they also appeared to show greater than expected conservation among divergent aspergillus species . taken together, this is consistent with them being promoter elements. further experimental analysis will be required to assess their functions – key to this will be whether they are involved in modulation of promoter activity or are, like the tata box, primarily associated with the core function, defining the promoter start site.

CONCLUSIONS
transcriptome sequencing, including 5′ specific analysis, has revealed the complexity of the a. nidulans transcriptome. we found alternatively spliced genes, intron retention and many cases of overlapping transcripts. in one example, meab, we have shown the antisense rna has a regulatory role. we also identified many previously unannotated genes. global analysis of 5′ transcript ends provides an extensive map of promoters across the genome, defining key features and facilitating future analysis of promoter structure and function.
