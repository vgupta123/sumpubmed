BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram positive bacterium carried in the nasopharynx and spread by human-to-human transmission causing different diseases ranging from mild, such as otitis media and sinusitis, to severe diseases, including pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis  <cit> . furthermore, s. pneumoniae is an important cause of septic arthritis  <cit> , and endocarditis  <cit> . asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx is an essential prerequisite for pneumococcal disease. worldwide about 40-90 % of children and 10 % of adults are colonized with s. pneumoniae  <cit> . risk groups for pneumococcal disease are children under the age of 2 years, elderly people and immunocompromised patients  <cit> . morbidity and mortality caused by s. pneumoniae infections are high, both in the developing and the developed world: annually  <dig>  million people die worldwide of pneumococcal infections  <cit> .

since pigs are very similar to humans in terms of anatomy, immunology and physiology  <cit>  they might be a good model to mimic human disease. more importantly, the porcine immune system closely resembles that of the human immune system for over 80 % of the analyzed parameters, whereas for mice this is less than 10 %  <cit> . for example the porcine complement activation is similar to that of humans in all pathways  <cit>  and pigs have th <dig> cells with functions similar to their human counterparts  <cit> . moreover, the cardiovascular physiology of pigs and men are very similar, indicating that pig models could be used to study the effects of s. pneumoniae on the cardiovascular system. pigs have been described as suitable models for human infectious diseases of different nature, like gram-negative bacteria induced meningitis  <cit>  and pneumonia  <cit> , gram-positive bacteria induced endocarditis  <cit> , scabies infections  <cit>  and fungal infections  <cit> . moreover, the availability of a large animal model allows to do repeated measurements, for example colonization can be monitored in time without killing the animal.

piglets are the natural host for streptococcus suis infections. there are striking similarities between s. suis pathogenesis in piglets and s. pneumoniae pathogenesis in humans. piglets develop severe disease like meningitis, sepsis, arthritis, endocarditis or pneumonia upon infection with s. suis  <cit> . s. suis is carried in the oropharynx, the bacterium colonizes the tonsil of piglets, similar to s. pneumoniae in children  <cit> . furthermore, genetically s. suis and s. pneumoniae are closely related  <cit> . in this study, we investigate the use of piglets as a model for human colonization and invasive disease caused by s. pneumoniae. we demonstrate that the pig is a suitable model to study pneumococcal colonization and invasive disease that could potentially be used for the development of new vaccines and therapies.

RESULTS
bacteraemia
pbcn <dig> is a serotype  <dig> strain, which was isolated from a patient with pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis without underlying co-morbidities. the piglets were inoculated intravenously, in the vena jugularis, with a high  or a low dose . all piglets, with the high dose as well as with the low dose, developed bacteraemia . bacterial numbers increased during the first two days, indicating that pneumococci replicated in the blood. however, piglets inoculated with the low dose cleared the bacteria faster and reached a significantly lower number of colony forming units  in blood than piglets inoculated with the high dose  . interestingly, one of the intranasally inoculated piglets developed pneumococcal bacteraemia as well, clearly demonstrating that s. pneumoniae is able to breach host defence barriers in pigs after intranasal inoculation . bacteria isolated from blood were confirmed to be s. pneumoniae using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight .fig.  <dig> bacteraemia in piglets due inoculation with s. pneumoniae. bacteraemia was monitored on a daily base in piglets infected intravenously  or intranasally  with s. pneumoniae by plating edta blood on selective agar plates. mean bacterial counts are depicted, error bars represent standard error of the mean. open symbols represent piglets infected with a low dose, closed symbols piglets infected with a high dose. each symbol represents 3 −  <dig> piglets, error bars show standard deviation. ** p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig>  



oropharyngeal colonization
bhn <dig>  a serotype 6b strain, has been frequently described in an experimental human carriage model  <cit> . this strain was originally isolated from a colonized individual  <cit> . the piglets were inoculated intranasally with a high  or a low dose . because selective culturing of s. pneumoniae using gentamycin was not possible in pigs due to overgrowth of many different organisms, the pneumococcal colonization of the oropharyngeal cavity was measured by polymerase chain reaction  on tonsil swab samples. the data  show that the piglets inoculated intranasally with the highest dose, were colonized with s. pneumoniae throughout the experiment. two piglets from this group were not  colonized at the end of the experiment. the oropharynx of all five piglets in this group was colonized for at least 5 days. piglets intranasally inoculated with the low dose showed limited colonization. these data clearly showed that s. pneumoniae can colonize the porcine oropharynx for at least seven consecutive days. s. suis was also detected by pcr on all days despite the specific selection of s. suis negative piglets. this was also confirmed by maldi-tof analyses.fig.  <dig> colonization of s. pneumoniae in the oropharynx of intranasally inoculated piglets. colonization with s. pneumoniae was detected using a pneumococcal specific qpcr. at day  <dig> prior to infection, no s. pneumoniae was detected. open symbols represent piglets infected with a low dose, closed symbols piglets infected with a high dose. each symbol represents 3 −  <dig> piglets, error bars show standard deviation. * p <  <dig>  . 100 pg of dna is equivalent to approximately 4 × 105 cfus



fever and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses
immediately after inoculation an increase in body temperature  was observed in all piglets inoculated with the high dose  . piglets inoculated intravenously with a high dose were febrile from 6 h post-inoculation  until 4 days p.i. and showed a second fever peak at 6 days p.i. piglets inoculated intravenously with a low dose were only febrile from 24 h p.i. until 2 days p.i., but the temperature remained above pre-infection level for 5 days. the intranasally inoculated pigs displayed shorter febrile periods: the high dose group was febrile after 6 h p.i. until 2 days p.i., with a second peak at 5 days p.i. whereas the low dose group was only febrile once at 5 days p.i. one day after inoculation, white blood cell counts of the intravenously inoculated piglets increased significantly , compared to white blood cell counts of the intranasally inoculated piglets, irrespective of the inoculation dose used . this leukocytosis is most likely the consequence of bacteraemia that was induced after intravenous inoculation. systemic pro-inflammatory immune responses were monitored in both high dose groups of piglets. intravenously infected piglets showed a peak production of interleukin  <dig>  and interleukin  <dig> beta  serum concentrations 1 day post-infection   to decrease to normal levels respectively  <dig> and 5 days post-infection.fig.  <dig> body temperature and white blood cell counts of piglets infected with s. pneumoniae. body temperature was recorded daily before inoculation and three times a day after inoculation. mean body temperature of piglets inoculated intravenously  or intranasally  with s. pneumoniae are depicted. white blood cell counts were determined daily, mean counts are depicted for piglets inoculated intravenously  or intranasally . open symbols represent piglets inoculated with a low dose, closed symbols piglets inoculated with a high dose. each symbol represents 3 −  <dig> piglets, error bars show standard deviation. *** p <  <dig>

arthritis
four out of the five piglets inoculated intravenously with a high dose and one piglet inoculated intravenously with a low dose showed clinical signs of polyarthritis in several legs for one or more consecutive days . within 16 h after inoculation  <dig> piglets showed signs of arthritis  in 1– <dig> legs, in one piglet arthritis in two joints was observed at 32 h post inoculation. in three piglets arthritis was short-lasting ; two piglets, both intravenously inoculated with a high dose were euthanized at  <dig> and 4 days post-infection as they reached the humane end points due to either the severity of disease in one piglet or the long duration of arthritis in another piglet. none of the piglets showed signs of arthritis from 4 days after inoculation on. besides clinical manifestation of arthritis, no other signs of illness were observed at the regular clinical examination time points. however, immediately after inoculation, in all groups independent of the administration route or the inoculation dose used, the playing behaviour of piglets as measured by continuous recording of the movement of a toy chain, was considerably reduced compared to the pre-infection period . these data clearly represent a discrete expression of subclinical illness after inoculation. at the time of necropsy, two piglets  showed signs of peritonitis with fibrinous exudates in the peritoneal cavity. similar clinical signs of disease are frequently observed in piglets inoculated with s. suis, clearly indicating that s. suis as well as s. pneumoniae preferably cause infections at the serosae.table  <dig> septic arthritis in piglets due to streptococcus pneumoniae

pathology
during necropsy, five piglets inoculated intravenously  as well as  <dig> piglets inoculated intranasally showed a serous hypersecretion of synovial fluid. bacteriological examination of two joints with a serofibrinous arthritis revealed that the arthritis was caused by s. pneumoniae. histological examination of the affected synovial membranes of the joints with arthritis revealed a serofibrinous synovialitis with moderate to extended mixed leucocyte cell infiltration into the subsynovial tissue in three piglets ; in joints with increased synovial fluids the histological changes were characterized by few foci with perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cells in the subsynovial tissue . this strongly suggests that the clinical symptoms, overfilled joints and arthritis indeed were caused by a systemic pneumococcal infection. during gross pathology mild, focal abnormalities in lungs were observed in the intravenously inoculated low dose group as well as in both groups of intranasally inoculated piglets.fig.  <dig> histological findings in joints of piglets inoculated with s. pneumoniae. panels a and b were obtained from synovial membranes  of piglets inoculated intravenously with a high dose. panel

discussion
here we demonstrate that pigs can be used as a model for human s. pneumoniae infections. induction of pneumococcal bacteraemia results in persistent fever and disease, mainly septic arthritis. systemic pro-inflammatory immune responses confirm the presence of pneumococcal induced inflammation in piglets. moreover, we showed that s. pneumoniae is able to colonize the oropharyngeal cavity of piglets, allowing for colonization and transmission studies.

stable oropharyngeal colonization of piglets with s. pneumoniae was determined by qpcr on tonsillar swab samples. selective culturing of s. pneumoniae using gentamycin was not possible in pigs due to overgrowth of many different organisms, making it impossible to specifically count pneumococcal cfu. despite the complex microbiome of porcine tonsils, consisting of more than  <dig> species  <cit>  including s. suis, it is apparently possible for s. pneumoniae to find its niche leading to colonization for at least 6 days. this enables the study of colonization as a function of time. currently, many research groups concentrate on the development of a universal serotype-independent vaccine, based on pneumococcal proteins  <cit> . there is a lot of experience with vaccination challenge experiments in pigs with porcine pathogens with a similar pathogenesis as s. pneumoniae in humans, like s. suis  <cit> . the piglet model described here may be an attractive alternative to study the efficacy of vaccine candidates, in particular at the level of colonization.

a significant number of intravenously inoculated piglets in this study developed arthritis. in humans  <cit>  invasive disease caused by s. pneumoniae mainly leads to meningitis and sepsis. however, in humans s. pneumoniae can also cause septic arthritis  <cit> . although human pneumococcal septic arthritis is less frequently observed it has been described as an emerging problem  <cit> . so far, an animal model inducing high levels of pneumococcal septic arthritis was not available.

pneumococcal septic arthritis is often accompanied by a serum leukocytosis of > 11 ×  <dig> cells liter− <dig>  systemically infected piglets also showed a serum leukocytosis, where wbc counts > 34 ×  <dig> cells liter− <dig> were observed. the occurrence of arthritis after s. suis infection is very common in pigs, arthritis is often the first clinical symptom that is observed  <cit> . the different outcome of clinical disease caused by s. pneumoniae in humans and piglets might be due to the species barrier. experimental s. pneumoniae models used doses ranging from  <dig> in human colonization studies  <cit>  to 2 ×  <dig> in insects  <cit>  and 5 ×  <dig> – 5 ×  <dig> in rodent models . in this piglet model we used a dose of  <dig>  × 106 cfu  and  <dig>  × 108 cfu . the pneumococcal isolate used for intravenous infection in this study was obtained from a patient that suffered from pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. apparently in piglets the pathogenesis have steered towards arthritis, instead of to the development of meningitis. however, it cannot be excluded that another human pneumococcal isolate could also cause meningitis in piglets, with or without arthritis.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the data presented in the study demonstrate that central aspects of human pneumococcal infections can be modelled in piglets. piglets can be very useful hosts for studies on mechanisms of colonization and invasive disease of s. pneumoniae infections as well as on the development of improved pneumococcal vaccines. moreover this is the first example of an animal model inducing high levels of pneumococcal septic arthritis.
