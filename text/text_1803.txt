BACKGROUND
vitamin a, an essential micronutrient, is required for embryonic development and pattern formation, postnatal growth, reproduction, epithelial maintenance, immunity and vision  <cit> . with the exception of the retina, where 11-cis-retinal acts as the chromophore for rhodopsin  <cit> , biological activities of vitamin a are largely mediated by isomers of retinoic acid . ras bind members of the ra receptor  and retinoid x receptor  families of ligand-dependent transcription factors to regulate transcriptional rates of retinoid response genes. vitamin a deficiency is associated with histological abnormalities in epithelial tissues  <cit> , decreased host resistance to tumor cells and infectious organisms  <cit> , and increased susceptibility to environmental carcinogens  <cit> .

animals, incapable of synthesizing vitamin a de novo from isoprenoid precursors, require dietary intake of preformed vitamin a, largely as retinyl esters, or must derive retinoids from metabolism of plant β-carotene and related carotenoids. in humans, provitamin a carotenoids contribute 40–80% of total vitamin a stores  <cit> . conversion of β-carotene to vitamin a is catalyzed by the enzyme β, β-carotene  <dig> '-monooxygenase   <cit> . the structurally related β-carotene 9',10'-oxygenase  catalyzes the quantitatively minor eccentric cleavage of β-carotene to β-apo-10'-carotenal, retinol and β-ionone  <cit> .

in rodents, nearly all absorbed β-carotene is converted to retinol in the intestine  <cit>  except at very high doses  <cit> . in contrast, humans convert only a portion of ingested β-carotene to vitamin a so that up to 15–30% of absorbed β-carotene remains intact  <cit>  and is delivered to tissues. several lines of evidence suggest that intestinal bcmo <dig> activity is subject to transcriptional regulation  <cit> . however, the mechanisms governing species-specific differences in efficiency of dietary β-carotene to retinoid cleavage remain unclear.

the human bcmo <dig> cdna encodes a 63-kda protein with homologies to members of a large and diverse family of polyene chain oxidases and carotenoid cleavage enzymes  <cit> . although bcmo <dig> can be detected in several tissues, its expression is most pronounced in intestinal mucosa and liver  <cit> . bcmo <dig> expression is downregulated in rat intestine by β-carotene and ra  <cit> . in addition, recent data demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ  regulates transcription of the mouse bcmo <dig> gene  <cit> . the human bcmo <dig> promoter sequences required for regulation of bcmo <dig> gene expression have not previously been defined.

we have isolated and characterized the human bcmo <dig> promoter region and identified several functional cis-acting elements. we report that in the human, unlike murids, myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  and ppar transcription factors interactively regulate intestinal cell bcmo <dig> gene expression. these data suggest that cooperation between mef <dig> and ppar factors may provide a molecular basis for the species differences between rodent and human in the transcriptional regulation of bcmo <dig> gene.

RESULTS
identification of cis-acting elements in the bcmo <dig> promoter
computational analysis of putative cis-acting elements located within the ~ <dig>  kb human bcmo <dig> 5'-flanking sequence was performed using the transfac database  <cit>  and tess program. several potential cis-acting elements were identified including, but not limited to, putative binding sites for cre, rar, mef <dig>  c/ebp, irf <dig>  gata <dig>  ap <dig> and ppar, and a tata box . since the mouse bcmo <dig> gene is regulated by pparγ  <cit> , initially we examined functionality of the ppar binding sequence in the human promoter. comparison between the human and mouse bcmo <dig> ~ <dig>  kb of genomic 5'-flanking sequences revealed approximately 33% homology with considerable gaps . several potential protein-dna binding sites including those for irf <dig>  gata <dig>  ap <dig>  ppar and tata are present in the same sequential order in the human and mouse bcmo <dig> promoters.

functional analysis of human bcmo <dig> basal promoter activity in tc- <dig> cells
to evaluate the functionality of these potential cis-acting elements, the ~ <dig>  kb nucleotide sequence upstream from the human bcmo <dig> coding sequence start site was excised from pbco1022-cr  and ligated into the pgl3-basic luciferase reporter vector . to determine whether this sequence confers promoter activity, several cell lines including tc- <dig> were transiently transfected with the pgl3-bco <dig> reporter . the human intestinal caco- <dig> derived tc- <dig> cell line is unusual in that it has significant endogenous bcmo <dig> activity  <cit> . we also have determined by rt-pcr that the parent caco- <dig> cell line expressed bcmo <dig> mrna, although at very low levels . figure 1a shows this cloned dna fragment drives enhanced luciferase expression in tc- <dig> cells.

to map the region in the bcmo <dig> gene that influences expression of the luciferase reporter construct, the ~ <dig>  kb promoter sequence was progressively deleted from the 5'-end by nested pcr to generate the deletion clones pgl3-bco <dig>  pgl3-bco <dig>  pgl3-bco <dig>  pgl3-bco <dig> and pgl3-bco <dig>  each construct was transfected into tc- <dig> cells. the expression vector pcmv-β-gal was used as an internal control for adjusting transfection efficiency. as shown in fig. 1b, deletion of the 5'-flanking  <dig> bp  minimally changed luciferase activity compared to the full-length, -987/+ <dig> genomic fragment. further deletions of the 5'-flanking sequence  progressively decreased luciferase activity by 25-30%. deletion of an additional 5'-flanking  <dig> bp  that includes putative mef <dig>  c/ebp and irf <dig> sites, dramatically decreased reporter gene expression. further deletion completely abolished bcmo <dig> reporter activity. as a negative control, tc- <dig> cells transfected with empty vector  showed no significant luciferase activity. transfection of the minimal promoter fragment  containing the ppar site  resulted in an approximate 12-fold induction of luciferase activity compared with the pgl3-basic vector .

mef <dig> and ppar sites in the bcmo <dig> promoter and basal transcription
the ~ <dig> bp genomic dna region proximal to the transcriptional start site was further investigated to determine which specific cis-acting elements confer basal expression of the human bcmo <dig> gene. sequence analysis suggested the presence of a mef <dig> binding site   that is absent in the mouse promoter, and a ppar/rxr binding site  conserved in the mouse promoter. therefore, the mef <dig> site was mutated  to test its contribution to basal transcriptional activity. as shown in figure 2b, transfection of a reporter construct containing the mutated mef <dig> binding site resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in luciferase activity compared to the wild type construct, pgl3-bco <dig>  a much greater reduction in reporter gene activities  resulted from mutation of the ppar site lying within the proximal promoter sequence. mutation of both mef <dig> and ppar sites within the proximal promoter region of bcmo <dig>  abrogated the expression of reporter gene.

verification of mef <dig> and ppar binding to the bcmo <dig> promoter
the following experiments were undertaken to verify that endogenous transcription factors bind to these different bcmo <dig> proximal promoter response elements. as shown in the western blots reproduced in additional file 2a, tc- <dig> cell nuclear extracts contain ppar isoforms , rxrα, rarβ and mef <dig> isoforms . the capacity of mef <dig> to bind the corresponding bcmo <dig> elements was then tested using emsa with tc- <dig> nuclear protein extracts and radiolabeled probes corresponding to the wild type or mutated mef <dig> binding sequence  . a mef <dig> dna-protein complex was detected  having electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to heterodimeric or homodimeric mef <dig> isoforms, consistent with previously reported observations  <cit> . specificity of mef <dig> binding was verified by three criteria. first, specific dna-protein binding was eliminated by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of the non-radiolabeled specific oligonucleotide. second, substitution of radiolabeled oligonucleotide in which the mef <dig> site was mutated also abolished dna-protein complex formation . finally, to further assess the identity of tc- <dig> cell nuclear proteins binding to the mef <dig> site, supershift analysis was performed using specific mef <dig> antibodies. the radiolabeled probe corresponding to the mef <dig> binding site was supershifted by addition of an antibody to mef2c to an extent that corresponded to its abundance in tc- <dig> cell nuclei . supershift assays showed diminished intensity of dna-protein complex with antibody against mef2a and an appearance of a supershifted band with antibody against mef2d. .

interrogation of the bcmo <dig> promoter ppar-response element   using emsa yielded a single ppre dna-protein band with the expected mobility . similar to the mef <dig> emsa, this binding was specific, as it was inhibited by addition of excess cold specific oligonucleotide and abolished by substitution of a mutated ppre oligonucleotide probe . the specificity of this interaction was further observed by the supershift assay. binding of members of the ppar family of transcription factors, rxr and rar transcription factors was demonstrated using the ppar site  as a probe. the results showed diminished intensity of the bound lower band  with addition of antibodies against pparγ and rxrα as well as the appearance of a weakly detectable supershifted band with addition of rxrα antibody . the extent of supershift with pparγ antibody corresponded to its low abundance in tc- <dig> cell nuclei as shown in additional file 2a.

the region of the human bcmo <dig> promoter flanked by the mef <dig>  and ap <dig>  elements contains a cluster of potential regulatory elements. a comparison of this dna region to the bcmo <dig> 5'-flanking regions in other currently sequenced genomes shows the mef <dig> site  and a putative c/ebp site  are uniquely present in the human bcmo <dig> promoter . the c/ebp dna response element showed specific transcription factor binding in tc- <dig> cells, but dna-protein binding did not significantly alter transcriptional activity of the promoter reporter constructs . putative irf- <dig> and gata <dig> binding sites in this region are represented both in the aligned human and mouse bcmo <dig> promoters. however, no specific protein binding to either of these dna elements in the tc- <dig> cell system was detected .

cooperation of mef2c and pparγ/rxrα in intestinal bcmo <dig> promoter activity
as an alternative strategy for characterizing the dependence of bcmo <dig> transcription on mef <dig> and ppar isoforms, in various experiments we co-transfected a proximal bcmo <dig> reporter construct  with mammalian expression vectors for mef2c, pparγ, rxrα or pparγ /rxrα, each of the latter under the control of a cytomegalovirus or rous sarcoma virus promoter. relative luciferase activity was normalized to that resulting from co-transfection with the empty vector, pcdna <dig>  cells in which mef2c was over-expressed showed an approximately three-fold increase in relative luciferase activity. conversely, expression of a dominant negative mef <dig>  reduced activity of the bcmo <dig> promoter reporter gene by half . as shown in additional file 3b, approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and three-fold increases in pgl3-bco <dig> luciferase activity were induced by pparγ, rxrα and pparγ /rxrα, respectively. surprisingly, co-expression of mef2c plus pparγ /rxrα resulted in a six-fold stimulation of the bcmo <dig> reporter expression , indicating mef <dig> and pparγ have an additive effect on bcmo <dig> promoter activity.

the role of the ppre in the bcmo <dig> promoter sequence was further probed using co-expression of pparγ /rxrα with the reporter construct containing the bcmo <dig> minimal promoter sequence . this dna fragment contains the ppre but lacks the mef <dig> sites. the resulting reporter gene activity was dramatically amplified. as a control condition, co-expression of pparγ /rxrα with this bcmo <dig> minimal promoter sequence in which the ppre was specifically mutated resulted in no increase in luciferase activity .

to confirm the additive effects of mef2c and pparγ in bcmo <dig> promoter activation, we utilized bcmo <dig> promoter constructs in which the respective response elements were mutated. wild type and mutated promoter constructs were then co-transfected into tc- <dig> cells with mef2c or pparγ /rxrα alone or in combination. as shown in additional file 3d, the wild type proximal promoter  enhanced bcmo <dig> reporter activity when co-transfected with mef2c, pparγ /rxrα or the combination of mef2c and pparγ /rxrα. mutation of the mef <dig> site , but not of the ppar site, significantly reduced this enhanced bcmo <dig> reporter expression by 24–30%. conversely, mutation of the ppre  not only dramatically decreased basal bcmo <dig> promoter activity, but also decreased the mef2c and pparγ-induced activation. the combinatorial effects of mef2c plus pparγ /rxrα on the bcmo <dig> reporter gene were abolished when either the mef <dig> site or ppar site were mutated.

discussion
although the in vivo enzymatic reaction first was described in  <dig> by moore  <cit> , identification of β-carotene oxygenase activity was only demonstrated in  <dig> when olsen and hayaishi  <cit>  and goodman and huang  <cit>  independently showed rat small intestine homogenates enzymatically cleave β-carotene at the  <dig> '-carbon double bond to yield two molecules of vitamin a aldehyde . more recently, this central cleavage enzyme, bcmo <dig>  was purified  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  cdnas were identified and the human recombinant enzyme was biochemically characterized  <cit>  as a monooxygenase  <cit> .

cleavage of β-carotene has been shown to be a source of target tissue retinoic acid production in the small intestine, liver, kidney, lung and testis  <cit> . in addition to considerable apparent tissue-specific regulation , bcmo <dig> is subject to species differences in the efficiency of intestinal β-carotene to retinoid cleavage. the goal of the current studies was to identify the basal promoter and core transcriptional elements responsible for regulating human bcmo <dig> expression in intestinal cells. the use of caco- <dig> derived tc- <dig> cells was prompted by their demonstrated endogenous bcmo <dig> activity. tc- <dig> cells have a phenotype even closer to small intestine enterocytes than does the parental population gauged by expression of several additional differentiation-associated proteins and nutrient absorption patterns  <cit> .

the comparison of the human and mouse promoter sequences by clustalw and manual inspection revealed little interspecies homology. whether this finding is relevant to the marked species differences in carotenoid absorption and metabolism is not known. in humans, although the majority of absorbed β-carotene can be converted in the intestine directly to retinal  <cit> , considerable β-carotene levels are detected in blood. in rodent small intestine, nearly all β-carotene is directly cleaved to retinal, leaving little intact β-carotene in the circulation.

recent data emphasize the concept that interspecies expression differences, especially in structural genes such as enzymes, are less the result of select trans-regulatory changes with widespread effects, but rather of many cis-acting changes spread throughout the genome  <cit> . the sequence context of the genomic dna regions that contain protein-binding sites may determine whether these regions function in transcriptional regulation. since closely spaced transcription factor binding sites can facilitate protein-protein interactions, clustering of protein-binding elements is often a hallmark of a subset of the control regions in genomic dna  <cit> .

we found the proximal  <dig> bp of genomic 5'-flanking sequence conferred maximal bcmo <dig> promoter activity in a homologous human intestinal cell system. our functional studies  establish that the minimal region of the human bcmo <dig> promoter required for induction of the gene is located within  <dig> bp upstream from the start site of transcription, a region that contains a cluster of cis-acting elements. mutation of the ppre or mef <dig> binding sites reduced basal promoter activity. mutation of both promoter elements abrogated bcmo <dig> transcription in intact cells, a result additive of the effects of mutating either site singly. coupled with the direct experimental confirmation of specific binding, the ppre and the human-specific mef <dig> site together regulate basal bcmo <dig> expression. this result differs from the mouse, in which the ppre solely is both necessary and sufficient for the restricted expression of bcmo <dig>  <cit> .

the mef <dig> family of transcription factors was initially identified from muscle cells due to binding to an a/t rich consensus sequence  found in the regulatory region of many muscle specific genes  <cit> . it since has become apparent that mef <dig> transcription factors participate in diverse gene regulatory programs, including those for muscle and neural differentiation, cardiac morphogenesis and blood vessel formation  <cit> . four mammalian isoforms of mef <dig> , encoded by separate genes, have been identified  <cit> . however, although mef <dig> has been shown to play important roles in several cell types including skeletal muscle, neurons, t cells and other non-muscle cells  <cit> , to our knowledge, a role for mef <dig> has not previously been described in intestinal epithelial cells. in the present work, we provide evidence that three isoforms of mef <dig>  are expressed in intestinal tc- <dig> cells . isoforms of mef <dig> have been studied in several biological systems, including muscle, neurons, and immune cells, where multiple isoforms are present  <cit> . whether different isoforms of mef <dig> present in the same cell may perform distinct molecular functions remains largely unknown. complexity arises from the observations that different isoforms of mef <dig> can form either heterodimers or homodimers having apparently indistinguishable dna-binding specificity. our data show mef2c is the major mef <dig> isoform that binds to bcmo <dig> promoter. consistent with this observation, our data showed that over-expression of mef2c significantly transactivated bcmo <dig> reporter gene activity in tc- <dig> cells.

mef <dig> proteins interact with and potentiate the action of other classes of lineage-specific transcription factors. in the present study, we also demonstrated that mef2c and pparγ cooperatively regulate bcmo <dig> gene expression, an observation reminiscent of the interaction between mef <dig> proteins and myogenic bhlh factors in skeletal muscles. several studies have reported functional interaction between mef <dig> proteins and members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as mef2a and thyroid hormone receptor  synergism to activate α-cardiac mhc gene expression  <cit>  and mef2c and pparα cooperation to induce human carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1β  gene activation  <cit> . given the co-expression of mef <dig> and ppar factors in several cell types including intestinal epithelial cells, the ppar-dependent mef <dig> pathway described in this work may provide a molecular paradigm for understanding the mechanism of action of mef <dig> in many target cells.

changes in expression magnitude and relative expression of genes can be a governing mechanism driving species diversification  <cit>  via adaptation to ecological, including nutritional, niches. the importance of bcmo <dig> gene expression in the maintenance of vitamin a sufficiency makes the bcmo <dig> promoter a likely target for natural selection. interspecies differences in efficiency of β-carotene metabolism raise the question whether different regions of the bcmo <dig> promoter have evolved under heterogeneous dietary constraints. the limitations of the present study preclude associating the human specific regulation of bcmo <dig> with specific metabolic consequences. nevertheless, our data suggest physiological hypothesis as only certain dna sequences functional for the binding of activators are conserved.

further investigation should advance the understanding of transcriptional control of the key step in β-carotene to vitamin a conversion and, consequently, may have relevance for physiology and human health.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed that the proximal ~ <dig> bp of bcmo <dig> promoter region is essential for basal promoter activity of human bcmo <dig> in intestinal tc- <dig> cells. pparγ is essential but not sufficient to activate human bcmo <dig> gene expression. bcmo <dig> expression is dependent on the cooperation between pparγ and mef <dig> isoforms. an understanding of the transcription factors and cis-acting elements involved in regulation of the human bcmo <dig> expression should facilitate a better understanding of the regulation of bcmo <dig> expression in physiologic and pathologic states of vitamin a formation.
