BACKGROUND
hsp <dig> proteins, named according to the  <dig> kda average molecular mass of their members, are highly conserved molecular chaperones that account for 1–2% of all cellular proteins in most cells under non-stress conditions  <cit> . they participate in the regulation of the stress response  <cit>  and, when associated with other co-chaperones, function in correctly folding newly synthesized proteins, stabilizing and refolding denatured proteins after stress, preventing misfolding and aggregation of unfolded or partially folded proteins, and assisting in protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum  and organellar membranes  <cit> . hsp <dig> members have key roles in the maturation of signal transduction proteins, like hormone receptors, various kinases, nitric oxide synthase and calcineurin  <cit> . through these substrates, they regulate diverse cellular processes. the combination of these functions appears to result in a role as a capacitor of phenotypic variation: decreasing cytosolic hsp <dig> function in drosophila melanogaster and arabidopsis thaliana results in the appearance of phenotypes that depend on the genetic background but which would normally be cryptic  <cit> .

hsp <dig> expression is also associated with many types of tumors including breast cancer, pancreatic carcinoma, human leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as multidrug resistance  <cit> . hsp <dig> inhibition provides a recently developed, important pharmacological platform for anticancer therapy  <cit> .

most eubacteria were thought to have a single homologue of hsp <dig> known as htpg , located on the chromosomal genome, whereas archaebacteria lack a hsp <dig> representative  <cit> . in eukaryotes all hsp <dig> genes are located on the nuclear genome, but their proteins function in the cytosol, er, chloroplast and mitochondria  <cit> . the cytosolic members, called hsp <dig>  in the sensu stricto appear in two major isoforms, hsp90-α  and hsp90-β   <cit> . these two isoforms are the result of a gene duplication about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the er member, generally called grp <dig> , was thought to exist in all eukaryotes except fungi, which appear to have lost it, and was suggested to have originated via gene duplication very early in eukaryote evolution  <cit> . a chloroplast homologue that is most similar in sequence to er grp <dig> has been found in three plant species  <cit> . the mitochondrial homologue, trap , is most closely related to eubacterial htpg sequences, which suggests it originated from a htpg-like ancestor  <cit> . as a distinctive feature, trap possesses a unique lxcxe motif that is absent in all other hsp <dig> family members, and depends on stress kinases for its transcriptional activation  <cit> .

there have been several studies that attempt to draw the phylogenetic relationships across all hsp <dig> family members  <cit> . however, due to the limited number of sequences used, and the lack of genome-wide information, the diversity of hsp <dig> family members and their evolutionary relationships are still not completely resolved.

the evolution of protein-coding genes is frequently applied to infer patterns of organismal evolution, but gene trees are sometimes not consistent with species trees. one problem that can be encountered, especially when using genes that belong to a large gene family, is the use of paralogous instead of orthologous gene copies in phylogenetic reconstruction. using information from complete genomes, however, and including all known family members minimizes this problem. because the hsp <dig> family of proteins exists in all organisms except archaea  <cit> , and because they are quite conserved, they provide an excellent model for understanding the evolutionary pattern of the majority of life on our planet. in the present study we analyzed  <dig> complete genomes, across all kingdoms of life, and retrieved all hsp <dig> family of sequences available within these genomes. in addition, we investigated the complete genomes of  <dig> and  <dig> further species of archaea and bacteria, respectively. we aimed to: 1) determine the diversity and distribution of hsp <dig> family members throughout all organisms, 2) document the chromosomal location and exon splicing patterns of hsp <dig> genes, and the amino acid  length and molecular mass of hsp <dig> proteins, and predict whether these genes are functional, 3) identify the conserved regions and the signature sequences of each class of hsp <dig> family members, 4) analyze the evolution of the gene family members throughout all kingdoms of organisms, 5) provide a case-study of the use of these proteins for addressing the phylogenetic relationship of all organisms, and 6) propose a standardized nomenclature system for the members of this gene family based on our earlier work  <cit> . this study establishes an overall framework of information for the family of hsp <dig> genes, which may facilitate and stimulate the study of this gene family across all organisms.

RESULTS
diversity and nomenclature of the hsp <dig> family of genes
there are a total of  <dig> genes belonging to the hsp <dig> family on the  <dig> genomes analyzed . out of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are putative functional genes and  <dig> are pseudogenes, based on functional motif/domain analysis . twelve genes are newly predicted in the study, and  <dig> protein sequences are newly deduced from mrna sequences available in databases. the new sequences are in additional file  <dig>  the number of hsp <dig> family members is highest on vertebrate genomes, with a total of 4– <dig> genes, followed by plantae with 3– <dig> genes, invertebrates  with 3– <dig> genes, protista with 2– <dig> genes, and bacteria with only 0– <dig> genes . in archaea, only methanosarcina mazei has a hsp90-like gene, and in viruses, there is no hsp <dig> homologue.

due to the limit of sequences that psi-blast database searching can report, the  <dig> query sequences used to probe the databases  each retrieved  <dig> similar sequences with the statistical significance threshold of  <dig> . removal of redundant sequences from the collection of  <dig> sequences resulted in  <dig> protein sequences that came from different submissions. from these,  <dig> complete sequences were confirmed to belong to the family, through similarity comparison after sequence alignment, and subsequently used for the analysis of protein features. from these complete sequences,  <dig> representative sequences, distributed across  <dig> species, and  <dig> genera in archaea, bacteria, protista, plantae, fungi and animalia, were selected for phylogenetic analysis. we established three-letter abbreviations of their species names  that were used throughout this study.

we divided the gene family into five subfamilies named hsp90a, hsp90b, hsp90c, trap and htpg. our earlier study proposed a new nomenclature system for the hsp <dig> family of genes on the human genome  <cit> , which was approved by the hugo gene nomenclature committee  <cit> . the system uses the root names hsp90a, hsp90b, and trap to indicate cytosolic, er, and mitochondrial hsp <dig> homologues, respectively. hsp90a was further divided into two classes: hsp90aa for conventional hsp90-alpha and hsp90ab for hsp90-beta. following schroda  <cit>  we used hsp90c to name the homologues found in the chloroplast. the present study retains the nomenclature system above  and also retains the conventional name for the bacterial homologue of hsp <dig>  htpg. following the guidelines for human and mouse gene nomenclature  <cit> , we used a number following the root/subfamily names to encode the gene in the subfamily, and a "p" at the end of the gene name to indicate a possible pseudogene . we used the three-letter code for different species  to distinguish the species of origin for homologous genes. the codes for species are put in parenthesis and prefixed to the gene names . in our search for an outgroup to root the hsp <dig> gene family we found that the archaean methanosarcina mazei hsp90-like gene, np_ <dig>  , can be aligned with htpg members despite not sharing the conserved residues/motifs present throughout all hsp <dig> members, and being significantly longer  than bacterial htpgs . when blasting this sequence against the protein database in genbank, we found that its closest relatives exist in bacteria . we decided to use this hsp90-like protein and one of its bacterial relatives as outgroups to htpg members.

the single-exon htpg genes are present in a variable number of copies across the  <dig> complete bacterial genomes investigated. five species have two copies of htpg,  <dig> species have a single copy, and  <dig> species have no homologous htpg genes. presence or absence of htpg on a particular genome is not strongly correlated with membership in any one bacterial group. for instance, whereas in cyanobacteria and spirochaeteles, htpg exists in all species investigated, and in lactobacillales and mollicutes no htpg was identified in any of the species investigated, in the genera corynebacterium, bacillus and haemophilus, htpg was only found in some species but not in others.

trap genes have 3– <dig> exons and are present only in animalia. hsp90c genes have 10– <dig> exons and only exist in plantae. hsp90b genes have 1– <dig> exons and exist in all species of protista, plantae and animalia, and some species in fungi. hsp90a genes have 1– <dig> exons and exist in all eukaryotic kingdoms. hsp90a were divided into two subdivisions, hsp90aa and hsp90ab  in vertebrates, and hsp90c was divided into hsp90c <dig> and hsp90c <dig> in plantae. the exon splicing patterns of representative members of the hsp <dig> family are shown in figure  <dig> 

protein features and conserved regions
a total of  <dig> complete amino acid sequences  can be reliably aligned, and the alignment of representative sequences from each of the  <dig> subfamilies is shown in figure  <dig>  based on the overall alignment, we divided the protein sequence into  <dig> conserved regions  and four variable regions . in a previous study, obermann and others  <cit>  divided hsp <dig> protein sequences into five domains: the n-terminal domain , charged domain  <dig> , middle domain , charged domain  <dig>  and c-terminal domain . in order to characterize the difference between subfamilies based on the overall alignment, we made further subdivisions to the domains mentioned above. we divided the n-terminal domain into the variable regions a  and conserved region i , identified a new conserved region ii  for the middle domain, and a new variable region c  for the charged domain  <dig>  and divided the c-terminal domain into the conserved region iii  and variable regions d . we also replaced the charged domain  <dig>  by the extended variable region b  in order to reflect the sequence variation found in our alignment for this area.

the residues that are conserved across all members of a subfamily or across all hsp <dig> family members, and that function as signature sequences, are summarized below . htpg genes, like most bacterial genes, have only one exon. their proteins are 588– <dig> a.a. long, have no signal peptide, and lack the variable regions a, b and d . this subfamily of proteins are the shortest in the hsp <dig> family, with molecular mass  <dig> – <dig>  kda , and are also the most variable with no recognizable signature sequences.

trap, hsp90c and hsp90b proteins possess a signal peptide that allows their export into mitochondria, chloroplasts, and er, respectively  <cit>  . trap genes have 3– <dig> exons, their proteins lack the variable regions b and d, and their mature protein sequences are 644– <dig> a.a. long with a molecular mass of  <dig> – <dig>  kda . five conserved motifs can each distinguish trap members from other subfamily members . hsp90c genes have 10– <dig> exons. their proteins have a shorter variable region b relative to hsp90a and hsp90b, are 756– <dig> a.a. long, and have a molecular mass of  <dig> – <dig>  kda in their mature status. eight unique motifs can distinguish hsp90c members from other subfamily members . hsp90b genes have 1– <dig> exons. their proteins have a shorter variable region b relative to hsp90a, and are 695– <dig> a.a. long with a molecular mass of  <dig> – <dig>  kda in mature status. we cannot find a completely conserved motif that alone distinguishes hsp90b proteins from the others but the simultaneous presence of three conserved motifs, as a group, can separate these proteins from other family members. a fourth motif, the most-c-terminal motif kdel of hsp90b, previously used as the signature motif for members of this subfamily, and thought to be the er retention signal, was here found to be not completely conserved across all hsp90b subfamily members. with the exception of the l residue, which is conserved across all sequences examined, at the k site,  <dig> % of the sequences in our aligment had an h, a, e, r, s or n residue instead. at the d site, g or n appeared in several cases , and at the e site, this residue was replaced by a d in a few cases . hsp90a genes have 1– <dig> exons. their proteins have a very short variable region a but a full-length variable region b, and they are 689– <dig> a.a. long with molecular mass of  <dig> – <dig>  kda in mature status. eleven conserved motifs can each distinguish hsp90a proteins from other subfamily members . the meevd motif at the c-terminal end was considered functional and characteristic of cytosolic hsp <dig>  <cit> . this motif is quite conserved but there are exceptions. in several cases the second e can be a q or a k , and its d is absent in hsp90a <dig>  hsp90ab sequences can be easily distinguished from hsp90aa sequences by the former having a unique lkid motif, and the latter having  <dig> unique motifs . there are, however, a small number of intermediate type sequences that fall between the typical hsp90aa and hsp90ab .

seventeen a.a. residues are completely conserved throughout all sequences . these residues as well as various conserved/functional domains shared by all hsp <dig> members may be fulfilling hsp90-specific functions. interproscan and scanprosite searches explored such domains . the "hsp <dig> protein" sequence  exists in all hsp <dig> sequences. there are several smaller "signature" sequences , an atp-binding domain , a glutamic acid-rich motif , and a four-helical cytokine region  . other domains/motifs that occur in some of these hsp <dig> a.a. sequences include a lysine-rich domain , a protein kinase c phosphorylation site , a casein kinase ii phosphorylation site , a n-glycosylation site , a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site , a tyrosine sulfation site , a camp- and cgmp-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site , a n-myristoylation site , a bipartite nuclear targeting site , a leucine zipper domain , and a amidation site .

phylogenetic relationships
out of the  <dig> sequences selected for the phylogenetic analysis,  <dig> belong to htpg,  <dig> to trap,  <dig> to hsp90c,  <dig> to hsp90b, and  <dig> to hsp90a. in order to maximize the number of characters that are alignable within and across closely related subfamily members, we divided these sequences into  <dig> subsets, htpg+trap, and hsp90a+b+c, and deleted the smaller non-alignable regions in each of these alignments. a total of  <dig> of  <dig> a.a  in the htpg+trap alignment and  <dig> of  <dig> a.a.  in the hsp90a+b+c alignment were finally used in the analysis. the hsp90-like np_ <dig>  and zp_ <dig>  were used as a combined outgroup for the htpg+trap alignment, whereas htpg <dig> and htpg <dig> were used as an outgroup for the hsp90a+b+c alignment.

the analysis of htpg+trap data led to a single most parsimonious tree , with tree length =  <dig>  consistency index  =  <dig> , homoplasy index  =  <dig> , retention index  =  <dig> , and rescaled consistency index  =  <dig> . eighty-four of the total  <dig> a.a. characters were constant,  <dig> were parsimony-uninformative and  <dig> were parsimony- informative. based on the tree topology, we divided the protein sequences into three main groups, groups a, b, and c. sequence length differences in four different positions along the alignment can differentiate the members of these three groups . our groups b and c were strongly supported with 99% and 80% bootstrap values, respectively, whereas group a was only moderately supported with a 54% bootstrap value. group b+c was supported with a 71% bootstrap value. groups b and c comprise only htpg proteins, whereas group a includes most htpg, and all hsp90a, hsp90b, hsp90c and trap proteins. in group a, hsp90a+b+c was a strongly supported monophyly with a 94% bootstrap value, and with firmicutes htpg proteins being the clade's closest relatives. trap proteins are monophyletic, supported with a 67% bootstrap value and also have firmicutes htpg proteins as their closest relative. spirochaetales hsp <dig> proteins are found in all three groups, those from γ-proteobacteria, firmicutes and actinobacteria are found in groups a and c, and those from bacteroidetes are found in groups b and c. the most parsimonious tree  for the hsp90a+b+c alignment is shown in figure  <dig>  out of  <dig> total characters,  <dig> are constant,  <dig> are parsimony-uninformative and  <dig> are parsimony-informative. the nodes for hsp90a, hsp90c and ingroup  are all strongly supported with bootstrap values of 83%, 94% and 90%, respectively. in vertebrates hsp90a has duplicated into hsp90aa and hsp90ab, both clades supported with high bootstrap values , but there are some intermediate sequences that according to their signature sequences should belong to hsp90aa but that in this analysis fall at the base of the hsp90ab clade. the hsp90a monophyletic clades that evolved within animalia, plantae, and fungi are all well supported by bootstrap values of 96%, 66% and 80%, respectively, and at the base of these clades are hsp90a subfamily members belonging to the protista. bad <dig>  of diplomonadida is at the root of the eukaryote members. hsp90b is not a monophyletic clade, and it originated earlier relative to hsp90a. hsp90c originated from hsp90b, and duplicated into hsp90c <dig> and hsp90c <dig> in higher plants with 100% and 98% bootstrap support, respectively. hsp90b <dig> of fungi did not cluster with the animalia sequences, as expected. instead it appeared as the most basal sequence within the hsp90a+b+c ingroup, but without >50% bootstrap support.

discussion
diversity, distinctive features and nomenclature of hsp <dig> family of genes
the present study presents the first comparative genomic study and evolutionary analysis of the hsp <dig> family of genes across all kingdoms of organisms. based on the phylogeny of their proteins and the cell compartments the proteins function in, we divided the gene family into  <dig> subfamilies, hsp90a, hsp90b, hsp90c, trap, and htpg, and established a new nomenclature system. this system may serve as a model for the nomenclature of other chaperone gene families . hsp90a and hsp90b exist in all eukaryotic kingdoms, whereas htpg, trap and hsp90c occur only in bacteria, animalia, and plantae, respectively. hsp90a duplicated into hsp90aa and hsp90ab in vertebrates, and hsp90c duplicated into hsp90c <dig> and hsp90c <dig> in higher plants.

seventeen completely conserved a.a. residues serve as markers to recognize any hsp <dig> family member, whereas membership into each subfamily is assigned by additional specific signature motifs, with the exception of htpg subfamily members.

from the  <dig> complete genomes investigated we found that the number of exons in hsp <dig> genes range from  <dig> to  <dig>  the mature a.a. length from  <dig> to  <dig> residues, and the molecular mass of mature proteins from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. the hsp <dig> family of genes  contain a large number of introns. these data contradict earlier work  <cit>  that suggested that hsp genes generally lacked introns, which would facilitate their rapid expression while avoiding incorrect rna spicing due to heat stress. other hsp families of genes have not been systematically studied, and possibly that some genes in these families also contain introns.

htpg subfamily of genes and the origin of hsp90
the alignment and phylogeny of htpg proteins divided them into three groups, each containing unique signature sequence and high or moderate bootstrap support. importantly, our genomic study showed that at least  <dig> species of bacteria  each have two htpg gene copies, each copy belonging to different groups. each htpg group also contains representatives of spirochaetales, γ-proteobacteria, firmicutes, actinobacteria and bacteroidetes. unlike the proteins in other subfamilies, htpg proteins are so divergent that they do not have a common signature sequence. our data suggest that htpg underwent two separate gene duplication events during its evolution . because the evolutionary origin and diversification of proeukaryotes is not yet resolved with certainty  <cit> , this limits our ability to discuss the evolution of htpg. stechman and cavalier-smith  <cit>  rooted their tree using a single and incomplete ecobacteria  htpg copy and did not consider htpg gene duplication events. as a result, they placed trap close to the base of all hsp <dig> family members. we decided to root the hsp <dig> tree based on an ancient gene duplication event. our genome searches identified hsp90-like proteins that exist in archaea and bacteria. they are most similar to htpg proteins but do not have the conserved marker residues characteristic of all hsp <dig> family members. using these hsp90-like sequences at the root of the tree, we postulate a gene duplication event that produced group c sequences at the base of the hsp <dig> family tree, and a sequence that gave rise, via another duplication event to groups a and b . this scenario is supported by the presence of  <dig> variable regions in htpg proteins , where the sequence length in each of these regions increases from group c to groups a and b. in additional support for this hypothesis is the observation that group a sequences and all eukaryote homologues have  <dig> common signature sequences. this hypothesis needs to be further addressed when more genome sequences, especially those from basal bacteria, become available.

in order to identify the type of organism where hsp <dig> proteins originated we observe that not all bacterial groups  have htpg genes on their genomes, and neither does archaea. if we assume that archaea and gram-positive bacteria are the most ancient lineages within prokaryotes  <cit> , then hsp <dig> proteins could have arisen within a bacterial lineage that later gave rise to the eukaryotic cell. if we assume, however, that archaea is a derived lineage from gram-positive bacteria  <cit> , then htpg proteins originated before the origin of archaea, but were subsequently lost in this lineage. it will be possible to elucidate these two alternatives when the origin of the tree of life is better understood. also, present-day bacteria taxonomy  <cit>  is not completely consistent with our tree topology for htpg proteins. hsp <dig> genes might provide a handle to elucidate bacterial evolution and taxonomy in future work.

trap subfamily of genes
consistent with emelyanov  <cit>  and stechmann and cavalier-smith  <cit> , our data suggests that trap evolved from within the ancestral eukaryotes, and was not derived from an endosymbiont of bacterial origin. in support of this claim we observed that trap <dig> protein  is encoded on the nuclear genome but localizes to the mitochondria due to a mitochondrial localization sequence in their n-terminus  <cit> . in some instances, trap homologues have also been found to localize to the cytosol or the nucleus  <cit> . on the other hand, phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genes including both small and large subunit rrna and cob and cox <dig>  suggested that mitochondria monophyletically arose from within a-proteobacteria  <cit> . our phylogeny suggests that trap is monophyletic, and its sister lineage is a sequence from desulfitobacterium hafniense a fimicutes bacterium, not a a-proteobacteria. in bacteria group a, fimicutes proteins are sister proteins to both the trap clade of proteins and to the hsp90a+b+c clade, which suggests a gene duplication event happened early in group a . trap proteins are most similar to eukaryote htpg, both lacking variable regions b and d. the n-terminal transit peptide sequence for targeting trap to mitochondria, not present in htpg proteins, appears to have evolved at the base of the trap lineage. trap genes only exist in animalia and some alveolata and englenozoa species in protista, and appear to be absent in others . the simplest way of explaining this pattern is for trap proteins to have evolved in a basal protista lineage, which eventually gave rise to other protista, to animalia, and to fungi, and for these proteins to have subsequently been lost in the fungi lineage.

hsp90b subfamily of genes
our data revealed that hsp90a+b+c is a monophyly with high bootstrap support and  <dig> signature motifs , rooted also to firmicutes htpg genes but distant from eukaryote trap genes. we suggest that eukaryote hsp90a+b+c and trap originated from different group a htpg ancestor copies present in the common ancestor of firmicutes and early eukaryotes. there are three main theories to explain the origin of eukaryotes. according to the archaeal hypothesis, a primitive amitochondriate eukaryote originated from an archaeabacterium  <cit> . the chimera hypothesis suggests that an amitochondriate cell emerged as a fusion between an archaeabacterium and a gram-negative eubacterium, with their genomes having mixed in some way  <cit> . cavalier-smith  <cit>  suggested that the eukaryota and archaea, as sisters, evolved from neomura, the suggested common ancestor that arose from within actinobacteria. our results reject the archaeal hypothesis due to the lack of a hsp <dig> homologue in archaea, and also the chimera hypothesis as firmicutes is a gram-positive, not a gram-negative bacteria. because firmicutes and actinobacteria are both gram-positive bacteria that share the closest hsp <dig> sequence to eukaryotic hsp <dig>  our data support the neomura synthesis. however, we have to assume that archaebacteria originally had a hsp <dig> homologue that was subsequently lost. our data show that all hsp90a+b+c and trap sequences share  <dig> signature motifs  that originated within htpg group a. this suggests that hsp90a+b+c and trap stem from a possible gene duplication event early in the evolution of group a, which is supported by a moderately high bootstrap. both ancestral sequences were taken into the nuclear genome of an eukaryotic cell when eukaryotes originated. firmicutes also has a group c htpg copy, but we could not determine whether a group b htpg copy also exists in this group of bacteria due to a limitation of sequence data. we assume that any htpg copy other than those of group a was not transferred into the nuclear genome of the original eukaryote cell.

gupta  <cit>  suggested that hsp90a  and hsp90b  constitute paralogous gene families that arose by a gene duplication event that took place very early in the evolution of eukaryote cells. only  <dig> hsp90a,  <dig> hsp90b and  <dig> hsp90c proteins sequences were involved in his phylogenetic study. subsequently, emelyanov  <cit>  and stechmann & cavalier-smith  <cit>  included  <dig> and  <dig> hsp90a,  <dig> and  <dig> hsp90b and  <dig> and  <dig> hsp90c sequences, respectively, in their phylogenetic studies, and considered that hsp90b and hsp90c  make a paraphyletic group, and sister group to hsp90a. these analyses, however, did not include any protist hsp90b sequences. our sequence data  were selected from all sequences currently available in the databases, and represents the largest data set assembled for the gene family across the broadest range of organisms. importantly, our data set contains  <dig> protist hsp90b sequences. in contrast to earlier conclusions, our analysis revealed that hsp90b originated earlier relative to hsp90c and hsp90a. the key-defining characteristic of all eukaryotic cells is the presence of a membrane-bounded nucleus. it is widely accepted that the eubacterial partner developed numerous membrane infolds in the formation of the eukaryote cell. the detachment of these membrane infolds from the symbiotic eubacteria eventually led to the creation of the er and nuclear envelope  <cit> . the er, a new compartment in the cell, now required molecular chaperones to transmit information within the compartment and to help transport "passenger proteins" across the membranes. because both of these functions have been associated with hsp90b members  <cit> , we propose that the ancestral htpg of the partner eubacteria evolved into hsp90b at the very beginning of the eukaryote cell formation.

subsequently, the genome of the eubacterial partner was transferred to the newly formed nucleus, which led to the creation of a new cell, the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. subsequently, two gene duplication events took place that led to hsp90c and hsp90a, respectively. the nested origin of the hsp90a and hsp90c clades within the hsp90b sequences, makes this latter group a paraphyletic group. hsp90b is the most diverse eukaryote hsp <dig> subfamily, even lacking a unique signature motif. its genes are glucose-regulated and induced by glucose starvation  <cit> . in addition, its proteins, once secreted to the er, are also known to participate in protein folding and assembly, in protein secretion, in protecting cells from undergoing apoptosis, and in mediating immunogenicity in tumor and virus-infected cells  <cit> . structurally, they have an er transit peptide, their variable region b is between hsp90a and hsp90c in length and their variable region d is the longest of all hsp <dig> subfamilies. the highly conserved c-terminus sequence kdel was thought to facilitate hsp90b retention in the er; however, our data show that the motif is variable across organisms. interestingly, hsp90b was thought to be absent in fungi  <cit> , but our genomic study detected a hsp90b copy in the fungus encephalitozoon cuniculi, but not in cryptococcus neoformans, neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae, which implies that the hsp90b has been lost in several fungi lineages.

hsp90c subfamily of genes
hsp90c genes appear to be monophyletic, given the high bootstrap support, and have  <dig> signature motifs. an earlier study  <cit>  made use of only four available hsp90c sequences for arabidopsis thaliana, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, oryza sativa and secale cereale, respectively. all of them contain a dpw motif at their c-termini, and we named them hsp90c <dig>  surprisingly, our genomic study revealed an additional copy from arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa. the additional copies have high similarity to hsp90c <dig> but lack the dpw motif, and we named them hsp90c <dig>  the chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome only has the hsp90c <dig> copy  <cit> , which is quite distinct from the hsp90c <dig> copy from higher plants. our phylogeny shows that the single hsp90c copy present in chlamydomonas duplicated into the hsp90c <dig> and hsp90c <dig> copies of higher plants, both clades supported with high bootstrap values. due to the limitation of the sequences available, the signature sequences of hsp90c members and the exact origin of the subsequent gene duplication event need to be further addressed. hsp90c <dig> proteins are localized only in the chloroplast  <cit> . this organelle is universally accepted to have monophyletically arisen from within cyanobacteria  <cit> . the phylogeny of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> also supported this synthesis  <cit> . in agreement with emelyanov  <cit>  and stechmann & cavalier-smith  <cit> , our data support the origin of chloroplast hsp90c from er hsp90b and from protista ancestors, not from plant hsp90b. this new hsp90c copy later acquired a chloroplast transit peptide. as in mitochondrial trap, the restricted presence of hsp90c genes, in this case only in plants and in some species of protista, implies that either hsp90c genes appeared in a lineage of protista that gave rise to plants or that they evolved earlier but have been lost in other lineages through unknown evolutionary pressures. our low bootstrap values at the base of the hsp90c clade do not allow us to distinguish between these alternative explanations. hsp90c <dig> proteins of arabidopsis thaliana and chlamydomonas reinhardtii are constitutively expressed but they are also light and heat-shock inducible. they exhibit weak atpase activity that can be inhibited by the hsp90-specific inhibitor radicicol, and possibly function in stress management and in the maturation of specific client protein, e.g. components of signal transduction pathways  <cit> . this is the first time that hsp90c <dig> genes have been reported, and their expression and function await to be addressed. based on the high sequence similarity with hsp90c <dig>  hsp90c <dig> proteins are possibly also working in the chloroplast but we cannot exclude the possibility that they are localized to other cell compartments

hsp90a subfamily of genes
our study indicates that hsp90a is also a monophyletic with high bootstrap support and  <dig> signature motifs. this is consistent with earlier studies in which all hsp90a sequences were clustered into a single clade  <cit> . in vertebrates hsp90a was divided into two classes hsp90aa and hsp90ab, with  <dig> and  <dig> signature sequences, respectively. however, the difference between these two classes was markedly smaller than the difference among hsp90a sequences across animals, fungi, plant and protists. an additional gene duplications event is required to explain the presence of hsp90aa and hsp90ab, which took place early in the origin of vertebrates. structurally, hsp90a lacks the signal peptide in its n-terminus and its variable region b is the longest of all subfamilies. hsp90a proteins are largely cytosolic  <cit> , have atpase activity, and are involved in the folding of cell regulatory proteins and the re-folding of stress-denatured polypeptides  <cit> . hsp90aa is somewhat inducible, whereas hsp90ab <dig> is more constitutively expressed  <cit> .

organismal evolution
the unicellular protists are universally accepted to be the original sources of eukaryote diversity. based primarily on their morphology and biology, protists can be assigned to several dozen well-characterized groups  <cit> . each of the other eukaryote kingdoms  can be directly traced back to a corresponding protist origin  <cit> . this explains why protist sequences are at the base of the various organismal branches within our hsp90a clade.

many attempts have been made to establish a natural, phylogenetic system of eukaryotes, but the relationships and the order of evolutionary emergence of many diverse groups remain unresolved, primarily because of the lack of clear synapomorphies  <cit> . our phylogeny of hsp90a among animalia, fungi, plantae and protista do not seem completely consistent with the current view of eukaryote evolution that postulates that animalia has a closer relationship to fungi than to plantae  <cit> . this contradiction with respect to the branching order was not supported by strong bootstrap values and was probably brought about by the limited number of genomes analyzed within the eukaryotes. phylogenies of other genes, including hsp <dig>  grp <dig> and 16s rrna  <cit> , and  <dig> protein-coding genes  <cit>  place diplomonadida  and parabasala at the base of the eukaryota. our phylogeny of the hsp90a clade also clearly demonstrates that giardia lamblia is basal to all eukaryotes, followed by trichomonas vaginalis in parabasala.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study presents the first comparative genomic study and evolutionary analysis of the hsp <dig> family of genes across all kingdoms of organisms. hsp <dig> family members underwent multiple duplications and also subsequent losses during their evolution. based on the phylogeny of their proteins and the cell compartments the proteins function in, we divided the gene family into  <dig> subfamilies, hsp90a, hsp90b, hsp90c, trap, and htpg, and established a new nomenclature system. this system has not been used for other gene families, and it may serve as a model for the nomenclature of other chaperone gene families  that have a similar status to the hsp <dig> gene family. this study established an overall framework of information for the family of hsp <dig> genes, which may facilitate and stimulate the study of this gene family across all organisms.
