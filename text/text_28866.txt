BACKGROUND
whether biomass-derived fuels play a major role in the world’s energy future depends on the development of technology to produce them at a cost that is competitive with petroleum and other alternatives  <cit> . fermentation of lignocellulose  is an attractive approach to fuel production given that plants are the most common raw organic feedstock on earth  <cit> . the development of better fermenting organisms could achieve much of the necessary cost reductions  <cit> . this represents an opportunity to apply recent advances in metabolic engineering and systems biology to a problem of major importance: the need for carbon-neutral fuels  <cit> .

the thermophilic anaerobic bacteria include species with natural abilities to digest and ferment the polysaccharides that make up the bulk of lignocellulosic biomass  <cit> . unfortunately, the lack of information and resources for these organisms has hindered their development. thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum is a gram positive, low g + c bacterium in the phylogenetic class “clostridia”  <cit> . members of the genus thermoanaerobacterium are thermophilic, rod shaped, chemoorganotrophic and able to reduce thiosulfate to elemental sulfur. the species t. saccharolyticum can ferment a wide array of carbohydrates, such as starch, xylan, glucose, cellobiose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, and galactose, but cannot degrade crystalline cellulose  <cit> . most sugars are fermented to ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and hydrogen  <cit> . t. saccharolyticum has a temperature range of 45–70°c, and ph range between  <dig> - <dig> . the formation of endospores has not been observed in this species as they have in the related genus clostridium.

a variety of thermophilic enzymes of industrial utility have been isolated from t. saccharolyticum, including endoxylanase, beta-xylosidase, amylopullanase and glucuronidase  <cit> . a system for genetic manipulation of t. saccharolyticum was first described by mai et al.  <cit> , which has been improved by the discovery of natural competence  <cit> , and the development of methods for making unmarked mutations with negatively selectable markers  <cit> . the genes for lactate dehydrogenase, phosphate transacetylase and acetate kinase were knocked out using these methods  <cit> . the result was a strain that produces ethanol at greater than 90% of theoretical yield, comparable to other ethanologens such as yeast, e. coli or z. mobilis  <cit> . the advantages that t. saccharolyticum has over these other biocatalysts are its elevated growth temperature , and its ability to hydrolyze hemicellulose and co-ferment the major sugars present in lignocellulose  <cit> .

cellulosic biomass from plants is prepared for hydrolysis and fermentation by various forms of pretreatment in order to expose the cellulose fibers and reduce particle size, though inhibitory compounds, such as furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural  are generated in the process  <cit> . cost effective ethanol production requires ethanol concentrations > 40 g/l, which necessitates that substrates, and by the same token their inhibitors, be present at fairly high concentrations. the ability to reduce costs by increasing levels of pretreated substrate is limited by the levels of inhibitors in the fermentation. while there is great potential to reduce costs by developing organisms with greater tolerance to inhibitors, little is known about the effects of these compounds on microbial physiology. one of the goals of this project was to generate information about the effects of specific inhibitors and complex inhibitor extracts from pretreated material. the project was undertaken as part of a larger project to develop t. saccharolyticum for fermentation of pretreated hardwood  <cit> .

another goal was to compare the genome of t. saccharolyticum to the genomes of other bacteria potentially important for biofuel production, including clostridium thermocellum, an organism highly specialized for the hydrolysis of cellulose and the focus of other omics and systems biology efforts. this work supplements the knowledge about both these important organisms and presents a comprehensive resource for further investigation.

RESULTS
genome sequencing
as the sequence was being generated, there were early indications that contig  <dig> was in fact a megaplasmid. furthermore, early draft sequences showed that the ends of contig  <dig> overlapped. when pcr primers were designed at the ends of contig  <dig> facing outwards, they amplified a product consistent with a circular dna molecule. the gene tsac_ <dig> on the putative megaplasmid encodes a repb dna replication protein with high similarity to replication proteins from a number of bacterial megaplasmids. these include: c. botulinum plasmid pcli , b. methanolicus plasmid pbm <dig> , and b. weihenstephanensis plasmid pbwb <dig> . contig  <dig> was poorly represented in the initial sanger sequence data and was observed to be completely absent in strain alk2; its loss as a complete unit further supporting its identification as an extra-chromosomal unit  <cit> .

the genome contains  <dig> orfs predicted to have transposase function, with  <dig> of these concentrated in a  <dig> kbp region. the tool prophage finder  <cit>  was used to identify two regions containing genes with similarity to known phage genes using the software’s strict search settings . these two regions are  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp, located between orfs tsac_ <dig> – tsac_ <dig> in contig  <dig> and between orfs tsac_2829-tsac_ <dig> in contig  <dig> . close examination of individual reads of cp <dig> showed that some proceeded from the phage into contig  <dig> near position  <dig> , <dig>  suggesting a phage integration site. contig  <dig> reads showed that in some, but not all of them the phage was absent. in those reads where the phage was missing, the sequence at 2009359– <dig> was duplicated. primers were designed to the chromosome flanking this region and in contig  <dig> facing outwards. all combinations of primers amplified, supporting the conclusion that contig  <dig> is a phage that exists in both integrated and circular forms at this locus .

the chromosome contains a region containing  <dig> crispr repeats along with  <dig> crispr-associated genes. the crispr spacers were aligned with blast against the genome and two of them were found to match the two putative phage regions. this suggests that this strain of t. saccharolyticum has a history of infection and defense against these two phage  <cit> . analysis of c. thermocellum also showed possible prophages and much more numerous and extensive crispr repeats and crispr-associated genes, possibly related to the low transformation efficiency of c. thermocellum  <cit> . additional analysis across other clostridia show further crispr features  <cit> .

a high percentage of genes  have predicted functions  related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism. for comparison, only  <dig> % of the orfs in c. thermocellum atcc <dig> are assigned to this functional group. both abc-type and phospotransferase transporters occur. the tool dbcan  <cit>  was used to compare all t. saccharolyticum protein sequences to hidden markov models  of all protein families in the cazy database. the program identified  <dig> orfs with similarity to glycosyl hydrolase hmms, including  <dig> in glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> with a predicted function of “cellulase,” all of which had at least one match with an e-value equal to or better than  <dig>  . it also identified  <dig> proteins with similarity to cellulose binding module hmms. it should be noted though that t. saccharolyticum does not grow on crystalline cellulose such as avicel  <cit> .

surprisingly, a total of  <dig> sporulation-associated genes were identified, including spo0a, but the strain is sporulation deficient, although some related strains have been observed to sporulate, namely thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum and members of the genus clostridium  <cit> . as with thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum  <cit> , t. saccharolyticum contains the nitrogenase genes required for nitrogen fixation. sequenced members of the related genus thermoanaerobacter apparently do not.

the genome contains  <dig> ribosomal regions, all oriented in the same direction. remarkably, the ribosomal sequences are not uniform, but rather of two types showing only 95% identity in the “universal” region of the 16 s subunit . similar, but less pronounced heterogeneity of ribosomal sequences has been noted in other firmicutes  <cit> , but has yet to be explained.figure  <dig>

t. saccharolyticum.

b) mfold prediction of the structure of the shorter 16s mrna  <cit> . c) mfold prediction of the structure of the longer 16s mrna.



it is possible that these additional sequences confer some advantage during growth at elevated temperatures. another possibility is that these modifications decrease sensitivity to an environmentally prevalent antibiotic that targets the 16 s rrna. the 16 s rrna is a common target for antibiotic compounds, for example aminoglycosides  <cit> . that said, resistance-conferring mutations are frequently single base pair changes rather than large insertion events  <cit> . in addition, at least for the aminoglycosides, the reported site of action is the a site near the 3’ end of the 16 s rrna  <cit> , whereas these insertions are very close to the 5’ end. however, the version that contains the inserts causes the 5’ and 3’ ends to no longer be located near one another, as can be seen in figure  <dig> panels b and c, and thus may be playing a role in resistance.

effects of hemicellulose extract
spotted microarrays were used to examine the effect that biomass-derived hydrolysate and the associated inhibitors have on t. saccharolyticum. in an initial experiment, cells were grown in fermenters containing rich medium and a mixture of xylose and glucose to mid-logarithmic phase, whereupon the cells were “shocked” by the addition of 10% volume of hemicellulose extract . control fermentations were conducted by shocking the cells with a mix of xylose and acetate at the same concentration and ph. the cells continued to grow, though growth was slightly slowed. samples were analyzed before and up to 1 hour after the shock using spotted microarrays. each mrna sample was measured relative to a genomic dna control, and all log <dig> ratios given below are relative to the gdna control  <cit> .

when comparing the results from control reactors to those treated with washate, an increasing number of genes were upregulated over time in response to washate . an alternate way of analyzing the same data is by comparing expression levels at a given time point to those previous to the shock . such comparisons versus the pre-shock culture showed more scatter, most likely due to growth phase-related gene expression changes.figure  <dig> 
time points between  <dig> and 60 minutes post-shock with hemicellulose extract. the horizontal axis represents log <dig> of the control xylose + acetate expression level , while the vertical axis represents the hemicellulose extract-treated expression level. all data are the average of duplicate experiments with the exception of the 5 minutes post hemicellulose extract shock which is in triplicate.



most of the genes affected by the washate were upregulated, with  <dig> having log <dig> ratios >  <dig> in at least one time point . at 5 min post-shock, a cluster of  <dig> genes  was upregulated. this cluster includes glycosyl hydrolases and carbohydrate transport and catabolism genes, including three genes required for arabinose utilization. at 15 min post-shock, additional genes were upregulated, including those responsible for the formation of bacterial microcompartments and rhamnose utilization.figure  <dig>

ratio > <dig>  in at least one time point. the range of log <dig> mrna:gdna ratios is given in the color key.



cdna samples from before and 1 hour post washate shock were also hybridized to tiled nimblegen microarrays. compared to data from spotted arrays, the tiled array data showed less noise in the lower dynamic range. moreover, by examining the expression levels visually, the boundaries of transcription units can be determined .figure  <dig>

effects of hmf and furfural
two of the major inhibitors in washate are furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural . to further investigate the specific effect these components have on t. saccharolyticum, we performed additional “shock” experiments in which hmf and furfural were added during logarithmic growth, while observing the cellular response by microarray and metabolite analysis. the levels of hmf and furfural in pretreated hardwood hydrolysates is approximately  <dig>  g/l. we tested additions of hmf and furfural from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g/l and found that  <dig>  g/l of each showed a clear effect on growth . notably, the effect was greatly diminished in medium containing yeast extract, so a defined medium was used in this experiment. sample processing methods for metabolite analysis were validated as described in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and table s <dig>  actively growing fermenters of t. saccharolyticum strain m <dig> at an o.d. of  <dig>  were shocked with  <dig>  g/l hmf and furfural. samples were taken before the shock and at 15 minutes,  <dig>   <dig>  and 4 hours after shock. these samples were analyzed via gc/ms and spotted microarrays.

a total of  <dig> different metabolites were tracked over the time course of the experiment . almost all metabolite concentrations showed a marked decrease at the 15 minute time point post exposure to hmf and furfural, with the exception of hydroxymethylfurfurol and citric acid. hydroxymethylfurfurol, presumably resulting from the reduction of hmf, increased steadily throughout the 4 hours that metabolites were tracked. hmf and furfural were almost entirely metabolized after 16 hours. it is notable that glucose-6-phosphate is among the many metabolites that decrease as the result of hmf and furfural addition. this suggests that the inhibition occurs very early in the glycolysis pathway, either at glucose transport or its phosphorylation, although additional experimentation will be required to confirm this hypothesis given the labile nature of glucose-6-phosphate.figure  <dig>

microarray analysis of the same fermentations showed large expression differences in the phage loci between replicates during growth in the presence of hmf and furfural . other non-phage genes were also observed to change sympathetically with the phage genes, including the aforementioned crisprs.

in order to determine if some of the same genes were affected by the addition of hmf/furfural as by washate, a comparison of the two datasets was performed. the log <dig> ratio difference was calculated and analyzed via t-tests using the control from the same time point as reference for washate shock and using the pre-shock as reference for hmf/furfural shock. the 15 minute and 60 minute time points were considered for each, and the greater log <dig> ratio or significance value was used. in the washate shock experiment  <dig> genes were significantly affected  in either the  <dig> or 60 minute time points, and in the hmf/furfural shock experiment,  <dig> genes were affected in either the  <dig> or 60 minute time points. between the two sets of significant genes,  <dig> were in common. of these,  <dig> had a log <dig> difference in either experiment greater than  <dig> , and  <dig> had a log <dig> difference greater than  <dig>  in both . among these notable genes upregulated after both types of shock are members of a gene cluster related to sulfur assimilation  possibly playing a role in sulfur utilization from expected or actual sources of sulfur present in some plant polysaccharides  <cit> , alanine dehydrogenase  and nadph-dependent methylglyoxal reductase . it should be noted, however, that this comparison is less than ideal in that different media and strains were used and that phage activity was noted in half of the hmf + furfural shock samples.

a wealth of other microarray and metabolite data were generated . note that at each timepoint listed in table  <dig>  multiple biological replicates were usually generated. in addition to testing numerous conditions, a variety of engineered and evolved strains were also analyzed. these strains were created as a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize t. saccharolyticum for industrial ethanol production, and are described in detail elsewhere  <cit> . the data are available as additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig>

genome scale in silico metabolic model
genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models are useful tools for exploring the metabolic capabilities of an organism and for integrating bioinformatics data sets with the metabolic network. a genome-scale model for thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum was built for this study based on its genomic content, current literature, and experimental data . an initial reaction list was built by comparing its genetic content with that of the related bacterium clostridium thermocellum, for which a curated metabolic model already exists  <cit> . to do this, a blast search was performed using the genes included in the c. thermocellum model versus the t. saccharolyticum orf predictions . this resulted in an initial set of  <dig> reactions with gene-reaction mappings to serve as the foundation of the reconstruction. additionally, metabolic pathways for xylose and sorbitol metabolism were added, and cellulose breakdown reactions were removed having never been considered in the reconstruction. the bifurcating ferredoxin:nad oxidoreductase described by wang et al. was added as well  <cit> . a number of other changes were made based on biochemical evidence, and additional gap filling was performed as described in the methods section to generate a working model. these changes are detailed in additional file  <dig>  the final model contains  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> reactions associated with  <dig> genes. a comparison of these statistics to the c. thermocellum model is shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

model validation
although the metabolic network composition at this stage was consistent with available information based on genome annotation and experimental observations  <cit> , the resulting flux space remained highly underdetermined. this is a consistent challenge facing all constraint-based models, because many thermodynamic and regulatory effects cannot be captured in the stoichiometric network. in particular for the t. saccharolyticum model, the diversity of hydrogenase systems hosted by this organism, left unconstrained, provide the network with many ways to efficiently regenerate cofactors, allowing biologically unrealistic levels of flux towards acetate and hydrogen. from a thermodynamic standpoint, actual allowable fluxes through these reactions are limited by many factors, including the intracellular concentrations of the cofactors, the concentration of hydrogen, intra- and extracellular ph, and the reduction potential of ferredoxin. this problem is complicated further by the kinetics and expression levels of the responsible enzymes. in the absence of the necessary parameters to formulate these constraints, we decided on a top-down approach to replicate experimental observations by making some of the hydrogenase reactions irreversible and by limiting the overall hydrogen production to observed yields. in a previous study  <cit> , the four gene operon hfs coding for the reaction ferredoxin hydrogenase was found to be the primary hydrogen producer in vivo, whereas the other hydrogenase genes tested were found to contribute only slightly or not at all to hydrogen production. reflecting this in the model, the energy-conserving hydrogenase  was blocked, and the bifurcating hydrogenase  and the nadh hydrogenase  were forced to be irreversible in the direction of hydrogen uptake. additionally, total hydrogen export was limited to a yield of  <dig>  m h2:m glucose to reflect the in vivo measurements  <cit> . these modifications had a dramatic impact on the predicted performance of the model by limiting the amount of reducing equivalents that could be sent to hydrogen production, thereby shifting some carbon flux from acetate to ethanol and other organic acids. further experimentation with hydrogenase constraints may prove useful to help understand how electron and carbon flow are related in this and other mixed-acid fermentors.

previous metabolic engineering efforts on t. saccharolyticum  <cit>  have explored two distinct strategies for improving ethanol yield: a carbon-centric approach that focuses on eliminating competing carbon fluxes at the pyruvate branch point, and an electron-centric approach that disrupts the cell’s ability to produce hydrogen as a highly-reduced electron acceptor. each of these strategies was shown to improve ethanol production to varying degrees. a phenotypic phase plane analysis was performed to explore the metabolic implications of these knockout strategies. figure  <dig> shows the optimal growth surfaces for these knockouts over the complete ranges of possible carbon uptake and ethanol production rates. in the wild-type seen in figure 6-a, optimal growth can occur across a wide range of ethanol flux values, limited by the maximum glucose uptake rate. knocking out the lactate dehydrogenase  and phosphotransacetylase  reactions eliminates stoichiometrically equivalent solutions, leading to a maximum growth rate that is coupled to high ethanol production . the coupling of ethanol flux to growth rate was found to be much stronger, however, in the electron-centered strategy , which removed the reactions for ldh and ferredoxin hydrogenase . this knockout strategy greatly limits the available solution space and tightly dictates the ethanol yield at some penalty to the maximum growth rate. this finding is consistent with experimental results, which found a lower overall growth rate and cellobiose uptake rate in the ldh-hfs deletion strain when compared to the wild-type or ldh-pta-ack deletion strain  <cit> . however, the strong coupling of ethanol production to growth rate in the ldh-hfs knockout strain implies that it may be a good candidate for adaptive evolution to improve ethanol productivity.figure  <dig> 
phenotypic phase planes for
t. saccharolyticum
high-ethanol knock out strains. the maximum growth rate is shown as a surface over a range of fluxes for glucose uptake and ethanol production. the wild-type surface  shows the maximum growth rate occurring equally across a wide range of ethanol production rates, while the phase planes for the Δldh-pta strain  and the Δldh-hfs strain  demonstrate that the potential solution space is trimmed in a way that couples maximum growth to high ethanol yield.



we attempted to determine if any other knockout strain designs would maximize ethanol production at an optimal growth rate. the bilevel optimization algorithm optknock  <cit>  was used to search for knockout strain designs that would improve production of ethanol by coupling it to improved growth rate. when optknock searches a maximum of  <dig> reaction knockouts, optimal ethanol production is predicted when knocking out ldh and hfs. when allowing three reactions knockouts, optknock finds a marginal improvement by deleting ldh, hfs, and glutamate dehydrogenase . removal of glud forces the cell to use the reactions glutamate synthase  and glutamine synthetase  in order to incorporate ammonium, spending an additional mole of atp per mole of ammonium . this inefficiency predicts only a marginal improvement in ethanol production of  <dig> % over the ∆ldh-∆hfs strain .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
