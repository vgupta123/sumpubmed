BACKGROUND
the anaerobic gram-positive bacterium clostridium beijerinckii is capable of producing acetone, butanol and ethanol  <cit> . these three are important chemical products, especially butanol, since it is not only a food-grade solvent, but also an excellent fuel potentially could be used as a replacement for oil. its features such as high boiling point and low emission are quite desirable  <cit> . similar to another abe-producing model strain clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  the ratio of the solvent produced by clostridium beijerinckii is close to 3:6: <dig>   <cit> . but clostridium beijerinckii has the advantage that its fermentation does not require the using of starch, which is a food source. it can utilize various kinds of biomass, including ‘waste’ material, therefore can lower the producing cost and enhance its practical competitiveness  <cit> . because of its great industrial potential, its model strain clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> has been sequenced by jgi  and the genomic data were made public in  <dig> . the abe-producing process starts from pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis. pyruvate can be further degraded into acetyl-coa. acetyl-coa could be transformed into ethanol, or through several steps, into butanol and acetone . so, the more monosaccharide molecules which are transferred into cells, and the higher sugar utilization efficiency, the better for the abe-production. phosphotransferase system  is an important mechanism for sugar transmembrane transportation and phosphorylation in bacteria  <cit> . this system is consisted of enzyme i, phosphocarrier protein  and enzyme ii complex. enzyme i and hpr will phosphorylate enzyme ii, which is also called permease since it is the unit which carries out the transmembrane transportation. enzyme ii has a, b, c, d subunits. in some microbial species these subunits each exist as a separate peptide, but in some other cases they may fuse together in various combinations. the iib subunit is the one which decides the substrate specificity. enzyme ii can be classified into at least  <dig> families  <cit> , according to their specific sugar substrates, and in different families the complex may be organized in different ways  <cit> . among them, the fructose/mannose/sorbose family is the only one which has iid subunit, and all the members in this family are capable of transport fructose  <cit> . the most well known genes in this family, include fructose-specific ones in bacillus subtilis <cit> , mannose-specific genes in escherichia coli <cit>  and sorbose-specific genes in klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> .

previous studies have revealed that enzyme i and the phosphocarrier protein  of pts generally has only one or two copies in clostridium strains, and they exist in the genomes monocistronically  <cit> . however, the genes consisted of the enzyme ii complex may have multiple copies, and often form operons together with their transcription regulatory units and the genes with related catalytical functions  <cit> . furthermore, the phosphotransferase systems in different types of microbial species have different mechanisms for regulation. for low gc gram-positive bacteria like clostridium, hpr is acting as an important switch. when carbon source is in short supply, hpr will be phosphorylated on the serine- <dig> residue by certain unique hpr kinase/phosphatase. in contrast, if carbon source is sufficient, the his- <dig> site of hpr is phosphorylated, and the pts-dependent sugar transportation and substrate-specific regulation are activated  <cit> .

although the study on phosphotransferase system has been going on for several decades, most of the previous reports are concentrated on limited number of model strains such as escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. since the beginning of this century, there are some researches on pts in clostridium, mostly on clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  which is the first clostridium sequenced. the importance of pts to the life process of various clostridium strains, and how the system is evolved, remain largely unknown. this work starts from the genomic data of clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  and other sequenced clostridium strains as well as some important related model species, and analyzes the complexity of the phosphotransferase system, especially focusing on the fructose/mannose/sorbose family. we hope to explain why and how clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can utilize more types of sugar substrate, and propose an evolutionary model for the phosphotransferase system. it may help to illustrate the solvent-producing mechanism in clostridium beijerinckii and other related industrial bacteria, which could have theoretical and practical importance for guiding to higher butanol production through certain optimizations.

RESULTS
large number of pts ii genes are identified in the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome
our study finds that there are  <dig> sets of pts ii genes in the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome . that is far more than the majority of the other sequenced clostridium strains, including clostridium botulinum a str. atcc  <dig>  <cit> , clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> , clostridium perfringens strain  <dig>  <cit>  , clostridium tetani e <dig>  <cit>  . only clostridium difficile  <dig>  <cit>   has a similar number. the pts ii gene copies in other species which are evolutionarily closer to clostridium are also significantly lower than that of clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome. for example, bacillus subtilis  has  <dig> sets. these findings are summarized in table  <dig>  there are  <dig> complete sets of pts ii genes which are belonging to the fructose/mannose/sorbose family among the  <dig> ones found in the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome, plus one additional iia and iib genes each . such a large number is never reported in any other known microbial species, including clostridium difficile  <dig> . their genomic organizations are illustrated in figure  <dig>  interestingly, all the fructose/mannose/sorbose family pts ii genes on the positive chain are located on the first half of the genome, while the ones on the negative chain are on the second half.

in contrast, the pts enzyme i and the phosphocarrier protein hpr, each have only one copy in the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome . this is consistent with other clostridium species.

analysis of gc content
to study these sets of fructose/mannose/sorbose family pts ii genes in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> in detail, we first calculated their gc percentages .

as we can see from the result, the gc contents of these sets of fructose/mannose/sorbose family pts ii genes can be divided into three groups, which are indicated in the table  <dig> with three different denotations, with *, # or nothing at all.

for the two sets of cbei3871/3872/3873/ <dig> and cbei4911/4912/4913/ <dig>  both their gc percentages are  <dig> %. the gc% of cbei0711/0712/ <dig> is over 37%. for the remaining sets, their gc percentages are ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. although that of cbei2195/2196/2197/ <dig> is  <dig> %, but if the inserted hypothetical protein cbei <dig> is considered altogether, it drops to  <dig> %. the two orphan genes of this family, cbei <dig> and cbei <dig>  are not necessarily conforming to this rule. it is noteworthy that the gc percentage of the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> whole genome is only  <dig> %, lower than that of any pts ii genes sets. we will discuss this later.

synteny analysis
according to figure  <dig>  the fructose/mannose/sorbose family pts ii genes in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can also be classified into three groups based on their synteny features. one group has both sigma- <dig> factor and sugar isomerase  in the neighborhood, such as cbei0955/0956/0957/ <dig>  cbei0963/0964/0965/ <dig> and cbei4557/4558/4559/ <dig>  another group has sigma- <dig> factor only, including cbei3871/3872/3873/ <dig> and cbei4911/4912/4913/ <dig>  the last group has neither sigma- <dig> factor nor sugar isomerase, like cbei0711/0712/ <dig>  we found these groupings are quite consistent with the ones discussed in the last section which are based on their gc percentages.

sigma- <dig> is a kind of transcriptional factors, commonly existed in bacteria. it can interact with promoters to activate the transcription process. the first sigma- <dig> factor, rpon, was found in  <dig> through the sequencing of klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> . according to previous report  <cit>  , in listeria monocytogenes, sigma- <dig> factor-dependent fructose/mannose/sorbose pts ii genes are found to be associated with the bacteria’s sensitivity of cytotoxin. therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that their presence around the fructose/mannose/sorbose pts ii genes in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  could also have certain functional importance.

construction of phylogenetic tree
since iib is the subunit which decides the pts substrate specificity, in this part of study we use cbei <dig> as the query for blastp, and analyze the evolutionary relationship among the pts fructose/mannose/sorbose family iib genes in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> and their homologous genes identified from other representative bacteria species .

as we can see from the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig>  the pts fructose/mannose/sorbose family iib genes in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can be grouped into three clusters too. one cluster contains cbei <dig>  another includes cbei <dig>  cbei <dig> and cbei <dig>  while cbei <dig>  cbei <dig>  cbei <dig> and cbei <dig> are together in the other. especially noteworthy is that the third cluster includes the known sorbose-specific iib gene kpn_ <dig> from klebsiella pneumoniae.

among the group which contains cbei <dig>  cbei <dig> and cbei <dig>  cbei <dig> is 95% identical to cbei <dig>  75% identical to cbei <dig>  and 39% identical to the fructose-specific iib gene bsu <dig> in bacillus subtilis over  <dig> aa  . however, cbei <dig> has also been found to be 59% identical to the mannose-specific iiab gene ecoli_uti89_c <dig>  on the other hand, although cbei <dig> is the closest to ecoli_uti89_c <dig> in terms of gene organization since in both cases the iia and iib subunits are fused together, they are not grouped in the same cluster.

this result reveals the complexity of the pts fructose/mannose/sorbose family. the reason that the transport systems for these three sugars can be classified into one family is because they are close to each other, highly homologous to each other, with few homologies to the genes in other families. but looking into it in more detail, we can find that pts ii genes for fructose and mannose transportation are closer than their relation with that of sorbose. as the result, both fructose and mannose pts ii genes phosphorylate fructose into phospho-6-fructose , while sorbose pts ii genes turns it into f-1-p. furthermore, according to reference  <cit> , the phosphorylation site on the fructose by the fructose-specific pts genes is o- <dig>  instead of the more common o- <dig> site. this is another proof that fructose-specific pts genes are closer to the mannose-specific ones.

an evolutionary model is proposed
to get a clearer picture of why there are so many copies of fructose/mannose/sorbose family pts ii genes in the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome, we applied the same analytical approaches to the model strain of bacillus subtilis, b. subtilis subsp. subtilis str.  <dig>  by identifying all the pts ii genes in its genome, annotating and classifying each sets as well as calculating their gc percentages. the results are in table s <dig> and showed that there are  <dig> sets of pts ii genes in b. subtilis subsp. subtilis str.  <dig>  one of them belongs to the fructose/mannose/sorbose family, namely bsu27040/27050/27050/ <dig>  which phosphorylates fructose into f-6-p. the gc percentages of these pts ii gene sets in b. subtilis subsp. subtilis str.  <dig> are ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with that of bsu27040/27050/27050/ <dig> is  <dig> %, slightly higher than the gc percentage of the whole genome, which is  <dig> %.

we did the same analysis to the model strain of e. coli, escherichia coli str. k- <dig> substr. dh10b .  <dig> sets of pts ii genes are identified, including one complete set of the fructose/mannose/sorbose family, i.e., ecdh10b 1955/1956/ <dig>  their gc contents are as high as  <dig> %, and as low as  <dig> %, while that of ecdh10b 1955/1956/ <dig> is  <dig> %, close to the average gc percentage of the escherichia coli str. k- <dig> substr. dh10b genome,  <dig> %.

as the results indicate, in all these bacterial species we studied, the gc percentages of pts ii gene sets are generally higher than the overall gc values of the host genomes. this leads us to speculate that the phosphotransferase system may have originated from certain high gc percentage microbial species, and during the evolutionary process lower gc percentage species acquired the components of this system from higher gc percentage species through horizontal gene transfer . the transfer may occur at an earlier stage of the evolution, since it becomes clear that the gc percentages of pts ii gene sets are being drawing closer to the average values of the host species after the transfer. for example, in escherichia coli str. k- <dig> substr. dh10b, they are generally between 50-60%. the values drop to the interval of 45-50% in b. subtilis subsp. subtilis str.  <dig>  in the clostridium strains in which gc contents are even lower, the values further decrease. in the case of clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  they are  <dig> to 38%. of course, this makes sense. understandably, the sugar transport system is of the utmost importance to bacteria, concerning the life or death of each organism. so this system must have existed in microbial species for quite a long time. however, as two strains highly representative of the fructose/mannose/sorbose family, both the fructose-specific pts ii genes in bacillus subtilis, and the mannose-specific ones in e. coli, their gc percentages are closer to the overall gc contents of their genomes. therefore, they may be ‘native’ to these species and later on transferred into clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> 

to test our hypothesis that lower gc content microbial species obtained pts ii genes from higher gc ones during the evolutionary process through horizontal gene transfer, we introduce pts ii genes from the fructose/mannitol  <cit>  family as references . this family, which contains no iid subunit, can phosphorylate fructose into f-1-p. like the case of cbei <dig>  in a lot of species, the iiabc subunits are fused together as one gene. since there is no iid subunit for this fructose/mannitol family, we use representative iiabc genes from the fructose/mannose/sorbose and fructose/mannitol families, run blastp separately, and use selected  resulting genes from both to construct another phylogenetic tree . we also construct the 16srna tree of the species involved . as shown in the 16srna tree, these studied species fall into two groups. escherichia coli uti <dig>  klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> , yersinia pestis co <dig> , yersinia pestis biovar microtus str.  <dig>  and actinobacillus succinogenes 130z  are grouped together . they are all gram-negative strains with relatively higher gc contents. another group contains all kinds of clostridium, bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str.  <dig>  staphylococcus epidermidis atcc  <dig> , streptococcus suis 98hah <dig> , streptomyces coelicolor a <dig> , listeria monocytogenes str. 4b f <dig>  and lactobacillus salivarius , which are all gram-positive strains. the phylogenetic tree in fig. 3a also includes two main branches. the upper one is the pts ii genes from the fructose/mannose/sorbose family, while genes from the fructose/mannitol family are in the lower half. comparing the trees in figs. 3a and 3b, we can find that the pts ii genes from bacillus subtilis and clostridium strains are grouped together with those from the gram-negative strains which we identified as the lower half in fig. 3b. this supports our hypothesis.

how the pts ii systems are evolved in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb 8052?
the genome size of clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> is about  <dig> mb, including  <dig> orfs. that is significantly larger than that of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  which has a chromosome of  <dig> mb plus a plasmid of 192kb  <cit> , totaling  <dig> orfs . this is likely due to more diverse living environments enjoyed by clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  which means more types of carbon sources it can utilize  <cit> . although they are in the same genus of clostridium, they separated relatively early in the evolutionary process  <cit> . clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> has been shown acquiring large quantities of outside genes through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> ; clostridium difficile  <dig> also has been found with as high as 11% of mobile gene contents in its genome  <cit> , which strongly indicates that it gained genes from other species. so, it is reasonable to expect similar events happened in c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> too. but in its distintive evolutionary process, c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> is able to keep large number of genes transferred from other species because it needs these genes to adapt to various soil environments. on the other hand, the living condition of c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> is relatively simpler, so only fewer genes which are essential to its life activity are kept. more specifically, c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> is quite different from c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> in terms of sugar needed. while c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> is starch-based, c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> is molasses-based. molasses contains 35% of sucrose, 7% of fructose and 5% of glucose . also, c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can ferment xylose degraded from agricultural wastes  <cit> . since c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can utilize more sugar substrates than c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  it makes senses that it needs more genes to break down these substrates. after querying the isfinder database , we identified  <dig> different types of insertion sequences in the c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome, among them  <dig> with e-score lower than 1e- <dig> . a lot of these insertion sequences have multiple copies. for example, iscb <dig> <cit>  has  <dig> copies. in clostridium perfringens, some pts genes are found to be flanked by insertion sequences  <cit> . in c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig>  we have similar findings too. this is in agreement with our hypothesis that c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome gained and kept large quantities of outside genes through hgt, including some pts genes.

another reason which leads to the fact that there are so many sets of the pts ii genes in the c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome is gene duplication. as shown in figure  <dig>  many pts iib genes have several close-related copies. for example, cbei <dig> and cbei <dig>  they are 95% identical. figure  <dig> shows that they share the same genetic organization and gene order. this strongly indicates that these genes are of great importance to the host bacteria, so they are duplicated in group, as functional backups for the original ones.

the correlation between sugar utilization and pts ii gene numbers
clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can better utilize fructose in the fermentation media than clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> . our findings have shown that in the clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome there are so many more gene sets of pts ii fructose/mannose/sorbose family than c. acetobutylicum atcc  <dig>  and with the consensus from previous reports  <cit>  that all gene sets of this family can transport fructose, we established a likely correlation between these facts.

in addition to the pts system, fructokinase  <cit>  can also phosphorylate fructose into phospho-6-fructose. however, fructokinase may not have played a major role in determining the difference between the fructose utilization efficiencies of these two clostridium model strains. in both genomes, there are two copies of fructokinase genes, cbei <dig> and cbei <dig> ;cac <dig> and cac <dig> 

it remains an unsolved question why these three sugars, fructose, mannose and sorbose, can form such a distinctive phosphotransferase family. in terms of their chemical structures, all three are hexose, but fructose and sorbose are ketoses while mannose is an aldose. probably they have very similar 3d structures. the presence of sugar isomerases around certain types of the fructose/mannose/sorbose family pts ii genes in the c. beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> genome seems to suggest this too.

CONCLUSIONS
in summation of the analysis performed in this research , we found that the fructose/mannose/sorbose family of pts ii genes in clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can be further classified into three groups , possibly corresponding to the three different sugar substrates of this family. in addition to their respective specific sugars, all of them are capable of transport fructose. it is highly likely that this finding offers a valid explanation that clostridium beijerinckii ncimb  <dig> can better utilize fructose as the sole carbon source than clostridium acetobutylicum atcc  <dig> 

we also proposed an evolutionary model which suggests the horizontal gene transfer of the phosphotransferase system from higher gc microbial to lower gc ones. this may help to illustrate the mechanism why bacteria can survive in different environments through their variable carbon sources.
