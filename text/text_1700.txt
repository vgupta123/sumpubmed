BACKGROUND
purple acid phosphatases  catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid esters and anhydrides  <cit> . in higher plants, paps are mostly related to the pi response  <cit> . the only pap that has been shown to affect carbon metabolism is atpap <dig>  which is targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria by an additional transmembrane motif at the c-terminus compared to other related proteins  <cit> . paps with a transmembrane motif at their c-termini are conserved in green plants, including the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote, ostreococcus tauri <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing atpap <dig> grew faster, produced more seeds and contained higher leaf sucrose content   <cit> . transgenic camelina sativa overexpressing atpap <dig> also grew faster and produced more seeds  <cit> . the pleiotropic growth-promoting effect of atpap <dig> is dependent on its c-terminal dual-targeting sequence  <cit> .

chloroplasts and mitochondria are two key organelles involved in energy metabolism in plant cells and how atpap <dig> affects the biology of these two organelles and supplies more energy for growth remains unknown. to study the impact of atpap <dig> overexpression on the energy status of plants, the levels of atp and adp in the leaves of 20-day-old atpap <dig> oe arabidopsis were measured and compared with those of wt plants. the transcriptomes of leaves and roots were also compared. atpap <dig> overexpression resulted in a widespread changes of the transcriptome in the transgenic plants, which may reflect the impact of changes in energy supply that feed back to alter transcriptional programmes.

RESULTS
atpap <dig> oe lines contain elevated levels of atp
to determine if the overexpression of atpap <dig> resulted in alteration in metabolites, lc-ms/ms analysis and bioluminescent based assays were carried out to measure the amount of atp and adp. as shown in table  <dig>  the leaves of atpap <dig> oe lines contained higher levels of atp and adp compared with the wt. in contrast, the atpap <dig> t-dna line contained similar levels of atp and adp to the wt. the atp/adp ratios among these lines were also unchanged. the levels of atp and adp in the wt are similar to those measured in the other studies  <cit> .

statistical differences  in the same column for each line were based on one-way anova analysis followed by tukey’s honestly significant differences  test using statistical program ibm spss  <dig>  within each column, the values marked by different letters  are significantly different . the data were reproducible in at least  <dig> independent experiments.

identification of genes differentially expressed in the atpap <dig> oe plants
to identify the molecular events associated with the fast growth phenotype of atpap <dig> oe lines, gene expression profiles from soil-grown 20-day-old wt, atpap <dig> t-dna line and atpap <dig> oe lines were analyzed with nimblegen cdna arrays at the middle of day under long day growth conditions . the lines at this stage did not show any differences in size, leaf number and appearance. there were  <dig> genes represented on the chip for leaf rna analysis and  <dig> genes on the chip for root rna analysis. each line had three biological replicates and the average hybridization signals detected in each line were normalized and compared with the signal intensities in the wt. pair-wise plots revealed good agreement between biological replicates . genes with mean signal intensities less than  <dig> in all four lines  were excluded from analysis. therefore, only  <dig> genes from leaves and  <dig> genes from roots were analyzed for differential expression. genes with mean signal intensities that differed significantly were filtered by a  <dig> -fold change  and p < <dig>  in a student’s t-test in both oe <dig> and oe <dig> lines when compared with the wt. of the significantly responsive transcripts,  <dig> genes  in the leaves and  <dig> genes  in the roots of both atpap <dig> oe lines were altered compared to wt . the overall view of the altered genes presented in a heat map  revealed that transcript abundance of most genes were downregulated in both leaves and roots, with fewer genes displaying an increase in transcript abundance,  <dig> out of  <dig> transcripts were decreased in abundance in leaves, while  <dig> out of  <dig> transcripts were decreased in abundance in roots.

functional category enrichment evaluation was performed using gene ontology  analysis in tair . analysis of the ratio of genes  indicated different expression patterns in each cluster. in general, more genes in leaves exhibited significant changes than in roots . this correlates with the more drastic phenotypic changes in leaves than in roots. this is reasonable, because overexpression of atpap <dig> could have direct impacts on both chloroplasts and mitochondria in leaves, but only on mitochondria in roots, although an effect on plastids cannot be excluded. in the “cellular component” cluster, there are more downregulated than upregulated transcripts in most of the categories in both leaves and roots. the only exception is “nucleus” in leaves, which has more upregulated transcripts, possibly indicating changes in regulators of gene transcription . in the “molecular function” cluster, the category “receptor binding or activity” displayed most changes, where most transcripts were downregulated. interestingly, there are more upregulated than downregulated transcripts in the category of “transcription factor activity” in the leaves . in the go clustering of “biological processes” in the leaves, the numbers of upregulated transcripts in the “developmental processes”, “dna and rna metabolism” and “transport” are greater than the numbers of downregulated transcripts, which could correlate with the fast-growing phenotype of the atpap <dig> oe lines . this was not observed in the roots , where all go categories had more downregulated transcripts . in addition, go annotation also showed very few gene changes in the atpap <dig> t-dna line compared to the wt , which is consistent with the wt-like phenotype of the atpap <dig> t-dna line, implying a redundant function of atpap <dig> with other protein homologs in the genome.

data for specific groups of genes were extracted and studied using the mapman hierarchical ontology software   <cit>  . again, more transcripts in leaves exhibited significant changes than in roots, including transcripts encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism , cell wall metabolism , glycolysis, mitochondria electron transport, atp synthesis and the tca cycle , amino acid synthesis  and lipid metabolism . in addition, many genes encoding proteins associated with development , transcription , protein modification and degradation , stress  and redox regulation  exhibited remarkable changes . thus, widespread reprogramming of the transcriptome in the atpap <dig> oe plants corresponded with their fast-growing phenotypes. a complete list of altered genes, including their putative function, can be found in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> .

energy-harvesting system in leaves
when the expression profiles of the energy-harvesting system in the source leaves were compared, transcript levels of genes encoding ps i core proteins, ps ii core proteins, lhc i proteins were not significantly altered  . in contrast, transcript levels of several genes encoding lhcii proteins, including lhcb  <dig>  , lhcb  <dig>  , lhcb  <dig>  , lhcb  <dig>   and lhcb  <dig> , were decreased  in the atpap <dig> oe lines. the transcript levels encoding other components in the electron flow chain, including cytochrome b6f complex, ferridoxin , plastocyanin , nadph dehydrogenase  complex, were mostly unaltered, except one of the two ferredoxin-nadp + reductases , fdc <dig>   <cit>  and ndho   <cit> , which was suppressed in the oe lines. only two transcripts were upregulated in the oe lines, including pgr5-like b , and cyt c6a   <cit> . all these changes reflected a reprogramming of energy harvest and electron transfer in the photosystems. note that organelle-encoded genes are not poly-adenylated and therefore their cdnas were not labeled in this study.

redox regulated proteins in leaves and roots
in leaf, electrons excited by sunlight are the ultimate source of reducing equivalents in plants. electron flow generated from the photosystems is used to reduce fd, which in turn can be used for reduction of nadp to nadph by fnr, for reduction of thiodoxins  by ferredoxin:thioredoxinreductase , for reduction of nitrite to ammonium by ferredoxin-nitrite reductase   <cit>  and for reduction of 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate to two glutamines by glutamate synthase . in the leaves and roots of the oe lines, there were no changes in the transcript abundance of four fd genes, two ftr genes, nine trx genes , or most enzymes regulated by trx    <cit> . in leaf, but not in root, the transcripts of two electron carriers fnr <dig> and fdc <dig> which play roles in photosynthesis, were downregulated. interestingly, the transcripts of nir  was downregulated in the roots, whereas g6pd <dig>  were downregulated specifically in both leaves  and roots , whereas the transcript of ato <dig> , a threodoxin in mitochondria, was upregulated in leaves  but was downregualted in roots , respectively.

calvin cycle, starch and sucrose synthesis in leaves
transcript abundance for the key enzyme of the calvin cycle, a transketolase , was induced in the leaves of atpap <dig> oe lines. upregulation of the transcript implied an activated calvin cycle activity and possible enhanced output of carbon skeletons for sucrose synthesis in the cytosol. atpap <dig> oe lines exhibited increased leaf sucrose content, a higher expression level of sps protein and a higher sps activity in leaves  <cit> . among the four sps genes in arabidopsis, atsps2f  exhibited a significant change in both leaves  and roots  of atpap <dig> oe lines . regarding sucrose cleavage enzymes that import sucrose in the sink tissues, two out of six sucrose synthases, susy <dig>  and susy <dig>  were upregulated in leaves, whereas transcripts of a gene for cell wall invertase  was significantly downregulated in the leaves of the oe lines . these results indicated an alteration of the gene expression pattern in sucrose metabolism. the transcript abundance of two key genes encoding enzymes in starch synthesis, plastid phosphoglucomutase  and adp-glucose pyrophosphatase small subunit  <dig>  were altered in the leaves. in addition, the transcript abundance of three starch degradation enzymes: water dikinase , α-amylase  <dig>  and glucanphophorylase , were significantly changed. taken together, atpap <dig> oe lines exhibited altered gene expression patterns for sucrose and starch metabolism.

glycolysis, the tca cycle and the electron transport chain in mitochondria
except for the upregulation of a cytosolic pyruvate kinase  in leaves and a downregulation of a pyruvate kinase  in roots, the expression levels of all of the genes of cytosolic enzymes involved in glycolysis were unaltered in leaves and roots . likewise, the expression levels of all genes in the tca cycle, except for the upregulation of a citrate synthase -like gene , were unchanged in the leaves and roots of both atpap <dig> oe lines . regarding the respiratory chain in mitochondria, only components of complex i, but not components of complexes ii, iii, iv, v, ubq and cytochrome c oxidase  biogenesis, were altered in both leaves and roots .

cell wall synthesis
thirty percent or more of cellular carbohydrate metabolism is consumed by the synthesis of wall components and cell shape morphogenesis  <cit> . enhanced atp production in source leaves of atpap <dig> oe lines could lead to a higher supply of sucrose for cell wall synthesis to support plant growth. atpap <dig> oe lines also exhibited significant changes in the expressions of genes encoding polygalacturonase, pectinesterase, cellulase and cellulose synthase . transcripts from  <dig> genes  in leaves  and  <dig> genes  in roots  were altered, which correlated with a higher growth rate in leaves than in roots, arising from enhanced sucrose synthesis in leaves. transcript of a gene encoding a protein similar to cellulose synthase  in the cellulose synthesis was induced up to 11-fold in the leaves of atpap <dig> oe lines. in addition, transcript levels of genes encoding expansin or expansin homologs  and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase  were also significantly upregulated in abundance. these alterations reflected an active state for cell wall growth and reorganization in leaves.

nitrogen and amino acid metabolism
faster plant growth and higher seed yield requires greater supply of nitrogen or re-allocation of available nitrogen sources. plants obtain nitrogen via ammonium or nitrate transporters in roots. nitrate is reduced to ammonium by two biochemical steps, nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction. the expression of the only nitrite reductase gene, nir , was significantly downregulated in the leaves , nitrate transporters, including atnrt <dig>    <cit> , atnrt <dig>    <cit>  were downregulated in the leaves and roots of both oe lines. interestingly, a high affinity ammonium transporter , was significantly induced in leaves. the reduced fd generated from photosynthesis activates nir activity posttranslationally; therefore, its lower mrna expression in the oe lines could result from negative feedback by higher specific activities. if the nir activity is indeed higher in the oe lines, more ammonium, but less nitrate, will be transported to the leaves. this could result in the upregulation of ammonium transporters, but downregulation of nitrate transporters in the leaves.

amino acids serve as precursors of metabolites or intermediates for the stress response  <cit> . noticeably, there was a clear tendency of repressed expression of genes associated with biosynthesis of the aspartate family amino acids  in the roots of both oe lines. in the leaves, except for genes of enzymes involving in the biosynthesis of homoserine, genes for pro, cys, ser and two genes for met synthesis, were upregulated; all other genes involved in trp and lys synthesis, and arg, trp, and ile degradation were downregulated.

the aromatic amino acids  metabolic pathway covers the synthesis of trp, phe and tyr  <cit> . nearly all the genes involved in this pathway were downregulated in both leaves and roots, suggesting a decreased transcriptional expression activity in the aaa metabolic pathway. in addition, a cytosolic nadp+-isocitrate dehydrogenase  responsible for 2-oxoglutarate production in amino acid synthesis  <cit>  was also downregulated in leaves.

potassium and iron uptake
the major potassium channel in leaves  is positively regulated by a kinase  and negatively regulated by a phosphatase   <cit> . expression of cipk <dig>  was significantly upregulated in the leaves of the oe lines . regarding fe uptake, one out of three fe  transporters  was significantly upregulated in leaves, and the expression of four out of eight ferric reductases including fro <dig> , fro <dig> , fro <dig>  and fro <dig>  changed significantly  whereas in the roots, transcripts of fro <dig>  and fro <dig> , were significantly altered in the roots .

secondary metabolism
sixty-three out of  <dig> genes involved in secondary metabolism in leaves were affected . these include genes involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis  and genes involved in phenols, glucosinolates, wax, and isoprenoids synthesis and degradation.

transcription factors
genes encoding transcription factors  constitute  <dig> to 7% of the arabidopsis genes  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes at least  <dig> tfs, classified into more than  <dig> families  <cit> . in this study, a larger amount of tfs were differentially expressed in the leaves  than in the roots  of atpap <dig> oe plants . the number of upregulated tfs  was higher than the number of downregulated tfs  in the leaves; however, in roots, there were fewer upregulated genes  than downregulated genes  . in leaf, the transcriptional repressor nf-ya <dig>  was up-regulated  at the transcriptional level. nf-ya <dig> could specifically bind to mir <dig>  which targets mrnas for cleavage or translational repression at multiple cellular processes  <cit> . the mrna of the transcriptional activators such as myb <dig>  in the lignin biosynthetic pathway  <cit> , a flowering bhlh transcriptional activator  control expression of the photoperiodic flowering  <cit> , were also found with increased transcripts abundance in the leaves. these repressors or activators might affect targeted gene expression to some extent at the transcriptional level.

nucleus-encoded chloroplastic and mitochondrial proteins
as atpap <dig> is targeted to the chloroplasts and mitochondria, the transcripts of genes encoding proteins of the “chloroplast” and “mitochondria” categories of tair were examined. about  <dig> % genes in the “chloroplast” and  <dig> % genes in the “mitochondria” of leaves and  <dig> % genes in the roots “mitochondria” transcripts were significantly changed. among ~ <dig> nucleus-encoded proteins identified in chloroplasts by proteomics studies  <cit> , more transcripts were significantly changed in the leaves  than in the roots  . among ~ <dig> nucleus-encoded proteins identified in mitochondria by proteomics studies  <cit> , again, more transcripts were significantly altered in leaves  than in roots  .

verification of candidate genes by real-time rt-pcr
to confirm the accuracy of the microarray data, real-time rt-pcr analysis was carried out on randomly selected genes from leaves. candidate genes selected were: a c <dig> domain-containing protein , a member of the receptor kinase-like protein family , a phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase family protein , a tyrosine specific protein phosphatase family protein  and a protein kinase family protein . gene expression values from real-time rt-pcr of the five genes were also compared to their values from the microarray data. the expression of each gene was consistent between the microarray and real-time rt-pcr results .

microarray data is highly correlated with the physiology of atpap <dig> oe lines
high exogenous sucrose induces anthocyanin biosynthesis in arabidopsis  <cit> . in the atpap <dig> oe plants, most genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were repressed . the key pathway gene dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  and downstream uf3gt decreased 2-fold compared to wt. other genes in the anthocyanin pathway also had attenuated gene expression in the oe lines. thus, these microarray data predict opposite effects of endogenous and exogenous sucrose on anthocyanin biosynthesis.

to examine the correlation between the microarray data and phenotypes, the levels of anthocyanin production in various lines were examined on sugar-treated ms plates. atpap <dig> t-dna insertion line had accumulated more anthocyanin than wt. in contrast, atpap <dig> oe <dig> line showed remarkably less purple color under the same treatment . mannitol and sorbitol are reduced forms of glucose and are not efficiently metabolized by plants  <cit> . higher concentration of mannitol and sorbitol  were added to the ms medium. these sugars also showed an anthocyanin background but there were few differences among the wt, atpap <dig> t-dna line and atpap <dig> oe lines . a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  was employed to verify the transcriptional expression of genes involved in the pathway. in high sucrose  ms medium, both wt and t-dna lines exhibited strong induction of dfr and production of anthocyanin pigment  <dig>    <cit>  whereas, the atpap <dig> oe <dig> line showed only weak induction of these  <dig> key genes . hence, the microarray data highly correlates with the physiology of the oe lines.

discussion
metabolomics analysis showed that atpap <dig> oe lines contained higher level of atp  and higher malate, citrate, fumarate and sucrose  <cit> . the fast growth, high seed yield and high sucrose phenotypes imply that the energy harvesting system of the oe lines may be more efficient, as the cell sizes and cell densities of the oe lines did not differ significantly compared to wt .

the high atp and sucrose contents of the oe lines must be generated by a higher output from the photosystems. plant harvests light energy by ps i and ps ii. in the leaves of both oe lines, while the mrna transcripts of the genes of ps i and ps ii core proteins and lhci did not change significantly, many transcripts of the mobile lhcii components were altered . how could overexpression of atpap <dig> cause changes in the expressions of lhcb genes? a possible explanation is that atpap <dig> overexpression triggers the regulation of redox-dependent retrograde signaling  <cit> . the expression of lhcb genes are regulated by the redox state of the plastoquinone  pool  <cit> . pq reduction suppresses lhcb family gene expression to avoid absorption of excess light energy  <cit> . in addition, lhcb genes could also be repressed by high sugar levels  <cit> . in addition to lhcb genes, the upregulation of pgrl1b, a key component of the pgrl1-dependent cef supercomplex  <cit>  and the downregulation of fnr <dig> were also significant, whether these changes can lead to a higher output of atp from the photosystems would be an interesting subject for future studies . photosynthesis also supplies reducing powers and many biological pathways are redox-regulated. the transcription levels of all thioredoxins were not significantly changed in both leaves and roots, and among the many fd- and trx-regulated enzymes in chloroplasts, only the transcriptions of nir and g6pd <dig> were specifically down- and up-regulated in both leaves and roots, respectively. this is reasonable because the activities of these proteins can be instantly regulated by the redox status  instead of transcriptional regulation, which is more time-consuming. our data indicates that the activities of nir and g6pd <dig> are subject to both redox and transcriptional regulations.

generally, if there is a higher output of atp from chloroplasts, the demand of atp production in mitochondria would be less. the increase in organic acids in leaves is consistent with the changes observed in the transcriptome in this study. the transcript of the cytosolic icdh  was strongly suppressed in the leaves of oe lines, which could account for the high citrate content in the oe lines  <cit> . previous studies have shown that alterations of carboxylic acids can lead to alterations in photosynthesis and enhanced growth  <cit> . one mechanism shown to operate on altering organic acids is an effect on stomatal aperture, and increased growth by 25%  <cit> . furthermore the role of citrate and malate in signaling changes in the transcriptome has been recently elucidated  <cit> , showing interactions with hormone biosynthetic pathways such as gibberellin biosynthesis. thus, overall the changes observed appear to mimic a reduction in carbon flow through the tca cycle, which leads to an increase in sucrose and photosynthesis. furthermore the changes due to increased levels of citrate, interact with hormone, ion  and biotic defense pathways  <cit> .

tca metabolites are the substrates of various biomolecules. the oe lines contain a lower level of aspartate family amino acids  than the wt, which could be caused by a higher capacity for malate production in the chloroplast. if excess malate is produced at the expense of oaa, the sole precursor of asp family amino acids, and leads to a lower level of precursors of these amino acids. all of the above correlates with the results of metabolites analysis  <cit> .

the fast-growing phenotypes of the atpap <dig> oe lines are dependent on the targeting of atpap <dig> to chloroplasts and mitochondria. while there are significant changes in energy harvesting and conversion processes related to chloroplasts’ functions , the expression of most genes involved in catabolism, including glycolysis, tca cycle and mitochondria respiratory chain, are unaltered in the oe lines. similarly, the activities of many enzymes in these pathways are regulated by the energy status  through allosteric regulation. our data indicated that transcriptional regulation is not a major control mechanism of these pathways in the current study. higher levels of energy production in chloroplasts would also alleviate the need for oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, which might cause the downregulation of the gene expression of complex i components . it would be interesting to measure the activity of complex i in the oe lines. reduced activity of complex i may lower the rate of consumption of carbon, allocating more carbon to be used for anabolism and growth.

leaves and roots are the source and sink of sucrose and energy and thus their carbon flows are different. since the leaves of oe lines produced more sucrose, the supply of sucrose to roots would be increased. the changes in transcription profiles in the roots of oe lines thus likely reflect the impacts of higher sucrose supply. cell wall invertase  is a sucrose-cleavage enzyme and is responsible for hydrolyzing apoplastic sucrose. as shown in figure  <dig>  the transcription of a cwinv gene  was downregulated in leaves but the transcription of another cwinv gene  was upregulated in roots. furthermore, the transcriptions of two sucrose synthase  genes were upregulated in leaves but not in roots. susy is a sucrose-cleavage enzyme which supplies hexose skeletons for cell wall synthesis. their differential expression may affect the growth rates of leaves and roots. it is also true for the differential expression of certain genes of the starch synthesis pathway. nonetheless, an sps gene  and a citrate synthase - like gene  were upregulated in both leaves and roots, while a phosphoglucomutase  was downregulated in both tissues.

overall, the transcriptomic responses to atpap <dig> overexpression were consistent with the growth phenotypes and metabolite analysis  <cit> . a considerable amount of specific genes related to photosynthesis, sucrose metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and amino acid anabolism were significantly altered. a summary combining the transcriptome and metabolome for depicting the mechanisms responding to atpap <dig> overexpression is proposed . atpap <dig> overexpression may reprogram the photosystems and thus supply more atp and carbon skeletons for sucrose and malate syntheses. the higher supply of malate causes the accumulation of organic acids, such as citrate and furmarate. the higher energy supply subsequently causes the alteration of many transcripts and metabolites.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reported the global changes in transcriptome of source  and sink  tissues when there are plenty supply of energy and sucrose. overexpression of atpap <dig> enhances atp production and sucrose synthesis in leaves, which provide more carbon skeleton for the roots. there are more than  <dig>  genes in the genome of arabidopsis and many gene families contain multiple members with highly homologous sequences or redundant functions. our results reported the genes that are subject to transcriptional regulation when the energy status of the plant is elevated. many scientists have attempted to enhance plant growth and yield by altering starch, sucrose, chloroplast or mitochondrial metabolism  <cit> . other attempts included manipulation of transcription factors and hormones  <cit> . this study shows that alterations of other components feed into these pathways, and the identification of regulators or proteins that sense of mediate switches in metabolism offer an attractive avenue to increase biomass accumulation.
