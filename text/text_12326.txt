BACKGROUND
after riek reported the first flea-like insect, tarwinia australis, from the early cretaceous of koonwarra, australia in  <dig>  <cit> , ponomarenko described a flea-like fossil, saurophthirus longipes, in  <dig>  <cit> . in the past 36 years, there were no more fossil fleas described from the mesozoic, even though thousands of other insect taxa have been reported from around the world  <cit> . extinct strashilidae have been described as flea relatives  <cit> , but recently they are re-interpreted as aberrant diptera  <cit> . since  <dig>  several flea fossils from the mid-mesozoic of northeastern china shed light on the origin and evolution of the basal and transitional fleas  <cit> . they were reported to live on diverse hosts such as coexisting feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs, primitive birds and medium-sized mammals  <cit> . it has been proposed that fleas might have originated from an extinct clade of scorpionflies  <cit> . mesozoic fleas have been organized in three families  <cit> . pseudopulicidae, possessing large body sizes and very robust piercing-sucking mouthparts, are considered as the basal and stem group of fleas  <cit> . monotypical tarwiniidae differ from pseudopulicidae and saurophthiridae in having free maxillary palp , but similar to pseudopulicidae in having tibial ctenidia  <cit> . saurophthiridae are more similar to extant fleas than pseudopulicids in the medium body size, short piercing suctorial stylet mouthparts and partially internal male genitalia   <cit> . up to now,  <dig> genera with  <dig> species have been assigned to these three flea families in the mesozoic. they were reported to live on diverse hosts such as coexisting feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs, primitive birds and medium-sized mammals  <cit> .

herein, we describe a new flea with transitional morphology from the early cretaceous, yixian formation of liaoning province, china. the new female flea has a fully distended abdomen, suggesting it might have consumed its last meal before its demise and subsequent fossilization. comparing this female specimen with other known female fossil fleas, we calculate and estimate the volume of blood intake by this flea. these new findings support the notion that fleas had already a broad diversity by the early cretaceous.

methods
the specimen was examined under a leica mz  <dig>  dissecting microscope, and the photographs were taken with a digital camera system connecting with the leica mz  <dig> . in some photos, ethanol  was put on the surface of the specimen to improve clarity and contrast of details. line drawings were prepared with coreldraw x <dig> and adobe photoshop cs  <dig> .

we summarize all known female fleas from the mesozoic in additional file 1: table s <dig> . based on the data from the additional file 1: table s <dig>  the average ratio of the width of abdomen / body length is  <dig> . we estimate that the abdominal width of the female of pseudopulex tanlan is about  <dig>  mm  without swelling. when it is fully distended, the abdomen width is  <dig>  mm. to estimate the volume of blood intake, we select the 3rd to 7th segments  as the expandable parts, and calculate an ellipsoid volume for the abdomen . we get two different ellipsoids , one has dimensions of radii of  <dig>  mm, 2 mm and 2 mm , the other has radii of  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm . we calculate the change of the volumes between these two ellipsoids based on the following formula: v = 4/3 * π * a * b * c . in our ellipsoids, the volume change is: v1 = 4/3 *  <dig>  *  <dig>  * 2 * 2–4/3 *  <dig>  *  <dig>  *  <dig>  *  <dig>  ≈ 22mm <dig>  therefore, we estimate the volume of blood intake by pseudopulex tanlan is nearly  <dig>  cc . .

discussion
classification of pseudopulex tanlan sp. nov.
although pseudopulex tanlan sp. nov. does not have ctenidia on the tibiae or body, nor preserved mouthparts, we consider it belonging to pseudopulicidae and hence to siphonaptera based on its wingless body covered with many stiff setae, characteristic helmet-like head, short and slightly fusiform antenna comprising compact short antennomeres, highly simplified thorax with segments similar to abdominal ones in size and form, legs with long tarsi and long, thin and gently curved claws with characteristic small basal lobe, female abdomen soft and distensible with eight well-visible spiracles and external male genitalia. it differs from other known pseudopulicids in having smaller body and head and shorter vestiture, male with shorter and smaller genitalia, and female with distinct cerci reaching the end of abdomen. four enigmatic ovate structures are revealed at the posterior part of heads of both female and male of p. tanlan . such structures have never been observed in other insects before, and their possible function is obscure.

preliminary phylogeny of known fleas of mesozoic
it has been suggested that some morphological transformations of early flea evolution are reducing their eyes and body sizes due to their ectoparasitic life style  <cit> . in the middle jurassic strata, all the reported fleas have large body sizes  <cit> . in the lower cretaceous strata, we found some fleas possessing relatively medium body sizes  <cit> , while nearly all the modern fleas are very small, under  <dig> mm in body lengths  <cit> . pseudopulex tanlan sp. nov. has a medium body size with length of about  <dig>  mm similar to that of saurophthirids, but less than half as long as p. magnus. in addition, p. tanlan lacks ctenidia on the apical tibiae, but its dense setae on the body have a regional distribution, that is, rows of short but hard setae covering the dorsal part of thorax and the 1st to 4th abdominal segments, while soft and relatively long setae covering the remaining abdominal segments . we consider the distinctly different distribution of setae in the new species, which are also found in saurophthirids, might be an evolutionary miniature of the common pseudocomb structures on the back of living fleas. therefore, p. tanlan is supposed to be a new representative of transitional fleas within pseudopulex. it is agreed that fleas evolved from a clade of winged insects  <cit> . huang et al. proposed that the blood-sucking behavior might have evolved from feeding plant fluids  <cit> . based on all described fossil fleas hitherto but constrained by insufficient and limited morphological data shown on some described specimens, a conceptual phylogeny of fleas is proposed in figure  <dig> to illustrate the evolution of fleas. in figure  <dig>  clade a is supported by the long proboscis with stylet mouthparts. clade b is supported by wingless and small, simplified thorax, compact antennae, and long tarsi with long, thin, and gently curved claws bearing small basal lobe. clade c is supported by the helmet-like head , and labial palpi closely associated with the beak . clade d  is supported by the hard, subrectangular pronotum narrowing rearwards , short, incrassate fore and mid coxae and tibiae, very long tarsi, and ctenidia covering apical and at least distal half of the outer margin of all tibiae. clade e is supported by the very thin and long legs with lateral position of coxae, loss of external abdominal segmentation in female, and at least partially internal male genitalia. clade f  is supported by labial palpi forming mouthpart sheaths  and simple band-like meso- and metanotum in both sexes , tarsi about as long as femur and tibia combined, female cerci short  or lost, and longer body vestiture. clade g  is supported by the less compacted antennomeres with large scape, relatively short stylets and the sclerotization abdominal sternites with greatly reduced setae. clade h is supported by very long serrated stylets with sharp saw-blade like notches , short but thick coxa and the tibia shorter or equal to femur. clade i  is supported by much higher number of antennomeres, extremely long stylets, shorter tarsi and tibial ctenidia not in row. clade j  is supported by the abdomen with small pygidium, relatively short legs, and small male genitalia. since important characters are not preserved in several specimens, eg. tarwinia without preserved detailed structures of head and mouthparts  <cit> , p. tanlan without mouthparts and with only partial mid- and hind legs, more mesozoic materials are needed to fine tune the proposed phylogeny.figure  <dig>

behavior of pseudopulex tanlan sp. nov
the female p. tanlan is the first flea from the mesozoic showing fully distended abdomen. all other known females of mesozoic fleas are covered with dense setae on the abdomens, so it is difficult to identify the boundary between segments. female p. tanlan is exceptional in having wide and clear segmental boundaries. additionally, its ratio of the width of abdomen to the body length is about  <dig>  vs. an average of  <dig>  for other reported mesozoic female fleas . based on the ratio data above, we estimate the non-swelling abdominal width of the female p. tanlan is about  <dig>  mm in contrast to  <dig>  mm when fully distended. we consider that the most inflated 3rd to 7th segments of the distensible abdomen is a reservoir for holding its blood intake. generally, examples of such broadly distended abdomens are very rare in the fossil record  <cit> . due to the well-preservation of this fossil specimen without any distinct signs of disarticulation, we consider decomposition as less probable as the cause of abdominal swelling. however, we can not rule out the inflation caused by carrying eggs, even though the effect of egg load on abdominal size is much less significant as evidenced by extant haematophagous insects like mosquitoes, biting midges and others.

this is the first time that two mesozoic fleas of p. tanlan with bodies in partially lateral view but heads in dorsal view  are described. it is of interest to note that all mesozoic fleas  are preserved in dorsoventral position implying more or less dorsoventral depressed body in contrast to laterally compressed extant fleas and, by inference, tarwinia. the female holotype of p. tanlan is preserved in partially lateral position, with all legs to one side, while the male paratype, in half-lateral position with legs directed to both sides. for the male fossil, its position can be interpreted as a result of a lateral direction of its robust legs which make it difficult for the insect taking a true lateral position, and a cylindrical to slightly compressed body somewhat turned sidewise during burial. in fact, this inference might be at least partly applicable to the male fossil of tarwinia as well  <cit> . unlike these, the fully distended body of female p. tanlan can be considered as near circular in section, and having comparatively weak legs, the insect was able to take almost any occasional position under the burial circumstances.

this inference that the female p. tanlan had a highly distensible abdomen which took nearly ovoid form under a complete blood load, make it possible for us to assess, even though roughly, the extent of its full diet. by calculating the volume changes from non-swelling to fully distended, we estimate an approximate volume of  <dig>  cc  of blood intake for p. tanlan . this volume is  <dig> times of the volume that extant fleas are able to consume in a meal  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
up to date, no more than  <dig> specimens of basal and transitional flea fossils have been collected from about  <dig> thousands of fossil insects in the cnu lab. they have diverse and different morphological characters supporting the notion that the cretaceous might be a significant transitional period for fleas, during which several groups with relatively reduced body sizes and other transitional characters gradually appeared . all these early fleas might have lived and fed on coexisting feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs, primitive birds or medium-sized mammals coexisting in northeastern china  <cit> . these diverse hosts and their various life styles during the early cretaceous might be a driving force to enhance the flourishing and diversification of fleas.
