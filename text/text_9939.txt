BACKGROUND
comparative genomics is a powerful tool to transfer genomic information from model species to related non-model species. this approach was first applied to construct a human-chimpanzee comparative genome map using bac end sequence  searched against human genome  <cit> . subsequently this approach was widely used for comparisons of mammalian genomes such as human-mouse  <cit> , human-cattle  <cit> , human-porcine  <cit>  and human-horse  <cit>  genome comparisons. recently, comparative genome studies have been conducted in a number of fish species  <cit> .

comparative genomic analyses could bring great benefits to non-model, economically important species. with exception of the recently published cod genome  <cit> , no whole-genome sequence exists for aquaculture fish species. for aquaculture species, comparative genomic analyses not only provide evolutionary perspectives for genome evolution, but also practical applications for the identification of positional candidate genes. it provides a useful tool for genome annotation and functional inference through the analysis of conserved syntenies. this is particularly important because direct testing of functions for a large number of aquaculture species may prove to be difficult to achieve.

comparative genome analysis requires rich genome resources. with the release of whole genome sequences from five teleost species: zebrafish  , fugu   <cit> , green-spotted pufferfish   <cit> , medaka   <cit>  and three-spined stickleback   <cit> , it is now possible to conduct initial comparative genome analysis for aquaculture species. in recent years, great effort has been devoted for the development of genome resources in aquaculture species. for instance, rich genome resources have been, or are being produced with atlantic salmon   <cit> , rainbow trout   <cit> , tilapia   <cit> , gilthead sea bream   <cit> , european sea bass   <cit> , and channel catfish  for reviews, see  <cit> . these genomic resources included expressed sequence tags , genetic linkage maps, bac-based physical maps and radiation hybrid  maps, and draft genome sequences which allow comparative genomic analyses to be conducted. second, conserved syntenic groups could be established through comparisons of model species with non-model species  <cit> . the search of conserved syntenies could enhance the identification of gene order, thereby allowing insight into orthologies that may be informative for the analysis of quantitative trait loci  for commercially important traits  <cit> . in addition, syntenies can provide evolutionary information that support phylogenetic studies for gene and genome annotation  <cit> .

channel catfish  is the primary aquaculture species in the united states. it is one of the six species included in the u.s. national animal genome project nrsp- <dig>  major progress has been made in developing genomic resources of catfish. these genomic resources included numerous molecular markers  <cit> , genetic linkage maps  <cit> , ests  <cit> , microarray platforms  <cit> , transcriptome generated using the next generation sequencing technologies  <cit> , bac libraries  <cit> , bac-based physical maps  <cit> , and a partially integrated physical and genetic linkage map  <cit> . with these genomic resources, comparative genomic analyses were conducted between catfish and model species. wang et al.  utilized  <dig>  catfish bess and identified syntenic regions among the genomes of catfish, zebrafish, and green-spotted pufferfish  <cit> . in a separate study, liu et al.  compared local conserved syntenies between the catfish and zebrafish genomes using a large number of bac end sequences  <cit> . kucuktas et al.  constructed a gene-based catfish linkage map that allowed preliminary comparison of genome similarities among several teleost species  <cit> . in all these earlier studies, high levels of inter- and intra-chromosomal shuffling were found, suggesting that the generalized linearity relationships may not apply to the organization of the catfish genome when compared to the genomes of other teleosts, as otherwise found between medaka-sea bream, tetraodon-sea bream, stickleback-sea bream, medaka-stickleback, tetraodon-medaka and tetraodon-stickleback genomes  <cit> . however, in these studies, only a small number of gene markers were used that may not allow detection of rearrangement events. fish-specific genome duplication and accompanying genome rearrangements were reported to lead to teleost species with a higher rate of gene-linkage disruption and lineage divergence than mammals  <cit> . study on comparison between zebrafish and tetraodon suggested that there were high levels of conserved syntenies between the majority of zebrafish and tetraodon chromosomes, but in the conserved syntenic regions numerous inversions existed involving large regions with altered gene orders and orientations  <cit> . in this study, we chose catfish linkage group  <dig> , which was found to contain microsatellite markers associated with the tolerance to hypoxia , as a pilot study to gain greater insight into the similarities and conserved syntenies between the catfish genome and the genomes of several well-characterized fish. here we report the potential orthologous chromosomes of catfish lg <dig> in several sequenced fish species, conserved syntenies, annotation of genes on lg <dig> of the catfish, and identification of a set of duplicated genes.

RESULTS
establishing chromosome-scale scaffolds
in order to conduct comparative genome analysis, the first required step without a whole genome sequence is to establish large scaffolds that can then be compared to chromosomal segments of other species with rich genomic resources. here, we started with the  <dig> bac end sequence-derived microsatellites that were mapped to lg <dig>  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  these  <dig> mapped bac end sequence-derived microsatellites were from  <dig> bac contigs of the physical map  <cit>  that included  <dig> bac end sequences   <cit> . therefore, all these  <dig> bess are on lg <dig>  however, the bess are short single pass reads and many of them do not contain gene sequences, making their direct comparison with other genomes difficult. consequently, blastn searches using these  <dig> bess against the draft catfish genome sequence contigs  resulted in  <dig> significant hits .

the  <dig> genome sequence contigs were then used as queries to determine what genes are associated with these genome sequence contigs using blastx searches against ensembl zebrafish protein database. the blastx searches resulted in  <dig> unique gene hits. because the genetic linkage positions of the  <dig> bess are known on lg <dig>  the blastx analysis allowed the anchor of the  <dig> genes on lg <dig>  forming the lg <dig> scaffold for comparative analysis. out of the  <dig> gene hits,  <dig> genes were hit by a single genome contig while  <dig> genes were hit by two or more catfish genome contigs . the two or more catfish genome sequence contigs that had sequence similarity with a single gene could be from different portion of the same gene , or from duplicated genes in the catfish genome .

identification of homologous chromosomes of catfish lg8
the  <dig> genes identified on lg <dig> were used as queries to search the genomes of the four sequenced teleost species, zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and green-spotted pufferfish. as summarized in table  <dig>  the largest number of genes had hits on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  in zebrafish, although significant hits existed for most of the chromosomes, as well as for unassigned scaffolds . similarly, the  <dig> genes also had largest number of hits on two chromosomes in medaka  and stickleback , and had largest hits on three chromosomes in green-spotted pufferfish . however, green-spotted pufferfish chromosome  <dig> had  <dig> gene hits, but there is only one syntenic block involved  <dig> genes. therefore green-spotted pufferfish chromosome  <dig> was not considered as homologous chromosome. these data suggested that the catfish lg <dig> was homologous to two or three chromosomes in the four sequenced fish genomes . as catfish is most closely related to zebrafish phylogenetically, the number of the genes with significant hits was also largest in zebrafish. in green-spotted pufferfish, a large number of these genes have not been assigned to chromosomes, and that is part of the reason that the number of genes with significant hits on the relevant chromosomes was low .

chromosomes with a large number of genes of catfish lg <dig> is underlined.

annotation of genes on catfish lg8
annotation in teleost species is often difficult because of the complications caused by gene and genome duplications. proper annotation of genes from a non-model species requires detailed phylogenetic analysis or analysis of evolutionarily conserved syntenic blocks. here we have annotated  <dig> genes on catfish lg <dig> through comparative analysis of conserved microsyntenies, with  <dig> genes having significant syntenic conservations on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> , and  <dig> genes having significant syntenic conservations on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> .

conserved syntenic blocks between catfish lg <dig> and zebrafish
to gain a close insight into the conserved genomic segments, conserved syntenies were examined between the catfish lg <dig> and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> conserved syntenies were identified. a total of  <dig> conserved syntenies were identified on chromosome  <dig> of zebrafish involving  <dig> genes. these conserved regions span a total of  <dig>  million base pairs  in the zebrafish genome. similarly, but to a larger extent, a total of  <dig> conserved syntenies were identified involving  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> of zebrafish. these conserved syntenies span a total of  <dig>  mb on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> .

various lengths of conserved syntenies were identified, ranging from just 40–50 kb to  <dig>  mb . in some cases, conserved syntenic blocks were extensive involving relatively large number of genes, strongly supporting the syntenic relationships. for instance, catfish contig  <dig> was homologous to a genomic segment of  <dig>  mb involving  <dig> identified genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  and the zebrafish intergenic spaces  are 350 kb, 41 kb, 73 kb, 199 kb, 15 kb, 66 kb, 65 kb, 215 kb, 98 kb, and 171 kb, indicating linearity relationships of genes and their positions . in other cases, however, large conserved syntenic blocks were identified involving only a small number of genes, less supportive of linearity relationships. for instance, the largest conserved syntenic block on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> spans a segment of  <dig>  mb , but only four genes are included in the bac contig  <dig>  the intergenic spaces  were 107 kb, 225 kb, and 2 mb between them, suggesting a huge deletion within the catfish genome among these genes as compared to the zebrafish genome, or a large number of genes in this region have not been detected in the catfish draft genome sequences.

conserved syntenic blocks between catfish and medaka, catfish and stickleback and between catfish and green-spotted pufferfish were also conducted . the situations are similar to the comparison with the zebrafish genome. overall, the scale of conserved synteny is largest between catfish lg <dig> and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  followed by medaka, stickleback, and green-spotted pufferfish .

chromosome level structural conservations
as described above, blast searches indicated that the catfish lg <dig> is homologous to two chromosomes of zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback, and three chromosomes of green-spotted pufferfish . we then focused on the gene position and gene order conservations at the chromosome level. for instance,  <dig> genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> were determined to be on the catfish lg <dig>  an examination of the chromosome locations of these  <dig> genes indicated that they were present on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at positions from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, 17 mb to  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, spanning a physical distance of  <dig>  mb. without a whole genome assembly in catfish, a complete comparison of gene positions is not yet possible at present because many genes were found to be in each of the physical map contigs, but the resolution of the genetic linkage map that positioned the linked bac contigs was not high enough to put the catfish genes on a linear order. therefore, many catfish genes are “stacked”. nonetheless, we were able to compare the gene positions and order at the chromosome level, ignoring the stacked genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  homologous genes located on a large segment of zebrafish chromosome  <dig> of approximately  <dig>  mb  existed on the catfish lg <dig>  spanning a genetic distance of 26 cm. however, this chromosome segment was rearranged in the catfish lg <dig> in at least  <dig> major blocks . the first block, located on lg <dig> position  <dig>  cm included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at chromosomal location  <dig> - <dig>  mb. the second block, located on lg <dig> position  <dig>  cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> - <dig>  mb. the third block, located on lg <dig> position  <dig>  cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> - <dig>  mb. the fourth block, located on lg <dig> position 43 cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> - <dig>  mb. the fifth block, located on lg <dig> position 42 cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> - <dig>  mb. the sixth block, located on lg <dig> position 43 cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> -22 mb. the seventh block, located on lg <dig> position 42 cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> -23 mb. the eighth block, located on lg <dig> position 43 cm, included  <dig> stacks of genes that are located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> at location  <dig> -24 mb. another two blocks from 45 cm and 44 cm involved  <dig> and  <dig> genes, which spanned  <dig> - <dig>  mb and  <dig> - <dig>  mb on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> 

similarly, the  <dig> zebrafish genes located on two major segments of chromosome  <dig> spanning a physical distance of 29 mb on the zebrafish genome, and they were mapped to the catfish lg <dig> spanning a genetic distance of 15 cm. very similar to the situation of the comparison between the catfish lg <dig> with zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  comparison of the catfish lg <dig> with zebrafish chromosome  <dig> also revealed extensive chromosome rearrangement in the catfish genome.

comparative analyses were also conducted between catfish and medaka, catfish and stickleback, catfish and green-spotted pufferfish . the situations are highly similar to the comparison with the zebrafish genome. overall, the organization of the catfish lg <dig> is most similar to that of zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  followed by medaka, stickleback, and green-spotted pufferfish. in addition, comparative map indicated that green-spotted pufferfish chormorsome  <dig> is homologous to zebrafish  <dig>  but chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> are homologous to zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  since the catfish physical contigs with significant gene hits on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> had significant gene hits on both chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> of green-spotted pufferfish. these findings here are consistent with woods et al.  <cit> , who reported that tetraodon chromosome  <dig> is homologous to zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  however, tetraodon chromosome  <dig> is homologous to zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  and tetraodon chromosome  <dig> is homologous to zebrafish chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> .

evolutionary junctions of chromosome rearrangement
comparisons between syntenic blocks on catfish lg <dig> and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  indicated extensive chromosomal rearrangements that fused the sequences on two chromosomes together within the catfish genome during evolution. through sequence analysis, genes involved in the same catfish physical map contig were found to be located on two chromosomes in the zebrafish genome. for instance,  <dig> genes were identified in the catfish physical map contig  <dig> . eleven of the  <dig> genes were found on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> while four of the  <dig> genes were found on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  similarly, four of the  <dig> genes in the catfish physical map contig  <dig> were found on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> while eight of the  <dig> genes on zebrafish chromosome 7; four of the  <dig> genes within the catfish physical map contig  <dig> were found on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and three genes were on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> . taken together, these findings suggested the presence of fusion junctions in these physical map contigs.

duplicated genes on catfish lg8
as discussed above, blastx analysis revealed that  <dig> genes match more than one draft catfish genome sequences . these  <dig> genes are potentially involved in duplicated genes on catfish lg <dig>  though an alternative possibility is that the two or more catfish genome contigs were unassembled contigs in the draft genome assembly. in order to identify the potentially duplicated genes on lg <dig>  all the  <dig> genes on lg <dig> were searched against catfish genome sequence contigs. the basic principle is that genes mapped to different genomic locations  are potentially duplicated, whereas the careful visual inspection needs to be applied. from blastn searches , a total of  <dig> genes were hit by multiple genome contigs. through visual inspections of the homologous regions of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes match more than one genomic sequence contigs by overlapping regions, suggesting that they may be potentially duplicated genes on lg <dig> . blastn searches  were carried out using the duplication-involved genome contigs to determine if these are truly duplicated genes. a total of  <dig> genome contigs that potentially represented duplicated genes were used as queries to search against themselves followed by visual inspection of the alignments. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as duplications on the catfish lg <dig> .

to further determine if these  <dig> genes were duplicated in the zebrafish genome, web-based blastp in ensembl was used to align these  <dig> genes with zebrafish protein database with genomic locations. a total of  <dig>  genes out of the  <dig> genes were determined to be duplicated in the zebrafish genome as well .

discussion
in this paper, we present the evidence that the catfish lg <dig> are homologous to two chromosomes in several sequenced teleost fish species, zebrafish, medaka, and stickleback, and to three chromosomes of green-spotted pufferfish. such findings were made possible by establishing chromosome level scaffolds using bac end sequences, the catfish physical map, and the catfish genetic linkage map  <cit> .

although there are sequence similarities between catfish and zebrafish at various levels, we decided to use only gene sequences for our analysis because gene sequences are more unique and highly conserved in the teleost genomes while sequences from intergenic regions are more divergent, and may involve repeated sequences. through analysis of  <dig> genes within the catfish lg <dig>  it is apparent that these genes are located mostly on two or three chromosomes of other teleost species . the largest number of genes was found in zebrafish on the two relevant chromosomes with  <dig> out of  <dig> genes located on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  followed by medaka with  <dig> genes, stickleback with  <dig> genes, and green-spotted pufferfish with just  <dig> genes. this is partly due to many of the genes were unassigned to chromosomes with green-spotted pufferfish and stickleback , but is consistent with their phylogenetic relationships with catfish.

analysis of conserved microsyntenies allowed identification of gene positions and order in different species, thereby establishing potential orthologies. through analyses of sequence similarity, genome context and neighboring genes, we were able to annotate a relatively large number of genes on catfish lg <dig>  the inferred orthologies are useful for genome annotation in catfish, and perhaps also useful for functional inference. orthology inference of gene functions will prove to be an effective approach for the vast majority of genes with aquaculture species  <cit> .

the catfish lg <dig> has a high level of similarity with part of zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> . however, extensive chromosome rearrangement must have occurred. numerous small syntenic blocks were identified , with some spanning only 40– <dig> kb while others spanning well over 2 mb . it is apparent that the catfish genome is well conserved at the chromosomal level with those of other teleosts, but extensive local shuffling lead to differences in gene positions and orientations.

genes included in the same catfish physical map contigs were found on two chromosomes in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and green-spotted pufferfish. for instance, genes included in physical map contigs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found to be on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> in zebrafish. one possibility is that the physical map was wrongly assembled due to duplicated genomic segments. however, this possibility did not hold because genetic linkage mapping of the bac end-associated microsatellites within these contigs placed the bac clones on the same linkage group, lg <dig>  in addition, we have examined the physical map assembly with extremely high stringencies at p = 10- <dig>  the associated genes from the same bac contigs still had hits to genes on both chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> in zebrafish. furthermore, in some cases two genes on the same catfish bac clone are homologous to genes on two different zebrafish chromosomes. for instance, the two genes from mate paired reads of bac end sequences residing within ctg <dig> were homologous to “cadherin  <dig>  type 2” located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  and to “mannose receptor, c type 1a” located on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> . taken together, these physical contigs should harbor the fusion junctions of the sequences from the two chromosomes during evolution. analysis of such junctions is not possible at present because the sequences are not yet available, but it should be interesting to look into these junctions to reveal evolutionary events in forming the chromosome represented by lg <dig> 

it is interesting to observe a higher level of genome scale structural conservation between catfish and zebrafish than between catfish and the other three fish species. however, it is also intriguing that catfish has  <dig> chromosomes whereas zebrafish has  <dig>  medaka has  <dig>  stickleback has  <dig>  and green-spotted pufferfish has  <dig> chromosomes, but yet the homologous chromosome segments of lg <dig> of catfish are distributed on two or three chromosomes in these fish, suggesting that some catfish chromosomes may have to be large to contain genes from several chromosome equivalents of the model fish species, or that significant chromosomal rearrangements have occurred during evolution, in contrast to the generalized linearity relationships among medaka, stickleback, green-spotted pufferfish, and sea bream as previously reported  <cit> . to the minimum, it is expected that in some cases, one chromosome of zebrafish  should be equivalent to more than one catfish chromosomes. whole genome comparative mapping is warranted to address such issues.

after two rounds of whole genome duplication in vertebrates, ray-finned fishes  had a third round, fish-specific genome duplication ~ <dig> million years ago   <cit> . studies on hox gene clusters from a spectrum of vertebrate species provided critical evidence in support of this hypothesis  <cit> . in addition, several studies have suggested increased rate of inter-chromosomal rearrangements following the whole-genome duplication   <cit> . further studies suggested eight major interchromosomal rearrangements in the  <dig> ancestor chromosomes in teleosts  <cit> . subsequently, the medaka lineage preserved its ancestral genomic structure and green-spotted pufferfish lineage underwent three major rearrangements, while the zebrafish lineage has experienced many interchromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . from the comparison of chromosome blocks among the five teleost species under study, it is apparent that many inter- as well as intra-chromosomal rearrangements may have occurred.

however, the conserved syntenies we identified between catfish lg <dig> and zebrafish chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and medaka chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are consistent with the ancestral vertebrate linkage groups model presented by nakatani et al.  <cit>  and danzmann et al.  <cit> . according to that model, there is strong affinity between the ancestral chromosome m and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and medaka chromosome  <dig>  similarly, there is partial affinity between the ancestral chromosome f and zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and medaka chromosome  <dig>  our results here provide additional support to the ancestral chromosome model, and hold promise for whole-genome comparative genome analysis.

a set of potentially duplicated genes were identified by sequence alignment analysis. although the final status of the nature of duplication requires additional work, particularly the sequence assembly of the whole genome sequence, it is apparent that  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes on catfish lg <dig> were duplicated. this rate of gene duplication is similar to that found in zebrafish genome   <cit> . in addition bloodthirsty-related gene family member  <dig> and its duplicated copy are located on the same scaffold in catfish, suggesting that they are intra-chromosomal duplication in the catfish genome. interestingly, this duplication pair is also located on the same chromosome in zebrafish . other  <dig> putative duplicated genes are potentially inter-chromosomal duplication because they are located on different scaffolds that have been mapped to different linkage groups  <cit> . therefore, all but one of the  <dig> duplicated genes are inter-chromosomal, consistent with the situations in related teleost species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, integrated genome resources with bac end sequences, physical map, linkage map and the draft genome sequences were used to conduct comparative genome analysis of the catfish lg <dig>  the catfish lg <dig> was found to be homologous to two chromosomes in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback and three chromosomes in green-spotted pufferfish. through syntenic analysis, a large number of genes were annotated on lg <dig>  detailed analysis of syntenic blocks suggested extensive inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements in the catfish genome, with certain bac contigs identified to contain evolutionary fusion junctions. a set of potentially duplicated genes was identified. as a pilot project, this work provided the proofs of the principle for whole genome comparative mapping, and for whole genome sequence assembly and annotation.
