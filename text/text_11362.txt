BACKGROUND
previously published work from our group has described an effective biocontrol strain m <dig> that was isolated from sweet melon rhizosphere in shanghai suburb in  <dig>  <cit> . this strain has been named as the pseudomonas sp. m <dig>  as its 16s ribosomal dna sequence shares a high similarity to that of p. aeruginosa  <cit> , as well as high sequence identities of several global regulatory genes, including gaca  <cit> , rpos  <cit> , qscr  <cit> , rhli  <cit> , lasi  <cit>  and rsma  <cit> . however, the strain m <dig> has developed several unusual features which distinguish it from that of the clinically significant p. aeruginosa strains, and indeed are more similar to soil-inhabiting biocontrol pseudomonas strains, such as p. fluorescence 2- <dig>  <cit> , pf- <dig>  <cit>  and p. chlororaphis pcl <dig>  <cit> . firstly, the predominant phenazine produced by the strain m <dig> is phenazine-1-carboxylic acid  rather than pyocyanin   <cit> . pca is considered to be a major biocontrol compound  <cit> , while pyo is not necessary for fungal killing  <cit> . it was determined that more pca could be produced in the strain m <dig> at 28°c rather than 37°c compared with that produced by the p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig>  <cit> . secondly, the strain m <dig> is the first strain that was reported to produce two antibiotics, pca and pyoluteorin  in one single strain  <cit> . the production of the two antibiotics of the strain m <dig> can result in synergistic antifungal activities against several phytopathogens. the biosynthesis gene clusters of two antibiotics share 99% nucleotide sequence identity with the clusters of liverpool epidemic strain p. aeruginosa lesb <dig>  however, a 5-base-pair deletion exists in the pltb gene of plt synthetic cluster resulting in a frameshift mutation in the strain lesb <dig>  <cit> . thirdly, several interesting features with regards to the regulatory mechanism of the production of these two antibiotics were found to be quite different from that in p. aeruginosa. for example, pca production is negatively regulated and plt production is positively regulated by a global regulator named gaca  <cit> . however, the converse relationship occurs in the strain m <dig> through another global regulator, rsma  <cit> . in a more recent study, we demonstrated the negative effect of the qscr regulator on pca production, but not on plt in the strain m <dig>  <cit> . studies have also been conducted on the differential regulation of pca and plt production by potential quorum sensing  signaling molecule n-acyl homoserine lactones  secreted by this strain  <cit> . the interrelationship between the qs las and rhl system in strain m <dig> are also different from that in strain p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> .

besides the biocontrol strain m <dig>  several p. aeruginosa strains, i.e., 7nsk <dig>  <cit> , pna <dig>  <cit> , nj- <dig>  <cit> , pupa <dig>  <cit> , which inhabit the rhizosphere niche, have been found to show excellent plant growth promoting feature and effective biocontrol property against various phytopathogens, and are utilized for biopesticide development. the genetically modified strain m <dig> has been recently developed as a high yield antifungal antibiotic pca producer  <cit> . however, little information is available on their specific genome structures, transcriptome profiles and virulence activities compared to their clinical counterparts.

a series of complete genomic sequences of p. aeruginosa strains that originated from patients  <cit>  have been published recently, and normal environmental p. aeruginosa isolates were chosen to compare their virulence and genomic structures  <cit> . to date, none of p. aeruginosa strains that originate from the rhizosphere has been completely sequenced and analyzed in detail. this study aims to delineate the genomic structural differences among various p. aeruginosa strains that originate from nosocomial patients and rhizosphere niches, and to improve our general understanding of what kinds of strategies have been adopted by the p. aeruginosa genome in response to various environment conditions, especially to different temperatures. in this report, the complete genome of the strain m <dig> was sequenced and compared with those of previously sequenced nosocomial strains. furthermore, the antimicrobial agent resistance in vitro and the competitive growth ability in a mouse model of acute lung infection in vivo were investigated in the two strains of m <dig> and lesb <dig>  the temperature dependent genome expression pattern based on the m <dig> genome was finally analyzed at 28°c and 37°c.

RESULTS
strain m <dig> is an effective biological control agent
the strain m <dig> was isolated from the sweet melon rhizosphere that grew in shanghai suburb in  <dig>  and proved to have effective biocontrol activity to protect plants against various phytopathogens infection  <cit> . in this report, we first provide the evidence to show that the secondary metabolites produced from the strain m <dig> have strong effective inhibitory activity against the growth of the mycosphaerella melonis mycelium plug on a potato dextrose agar  plate  and therapeutic anti-fungal effect on the sweat melon plant with full recovery of the plant infected by the m. melonis fungus two days after the culture of  <dig> cfu/ml of the strain m <dig> that was sprayed on the infected sweat melon stem . we have already found that the strain m <dig> has a broad spectrum of anti-fungal activities against various phytopathogens, including rhizoctonia solani, sclerotina sclerotiorum, fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum gossypii, mycosphaerella melonis, phytophthora capsici, ralstonia solanacearum and others. the strain m <dig> also shows effective inhibiting activity against both the gram-negative bacterium xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, and the gram-positive bacterium bacillus cereus . therefore, the unusual features of the strain m <dig> against various fungal phytopathogens and bacteria prompted us to sequence the complete genome of this strain to ascertain more about the genomic structures, with specific reference to this expression pattern at different temperatures through analysis of microarray-based transcriptome profiles.

general genomic features and comparative analysis
the complete genome of the strain m <dig> was sequenced and assembled as shown in figure  <dig>  a general comparison of the genomic features of the strain m <dig> and other sequenced nosocomial p. aeruginosa strains is shown in table  <dig>  the average gc content of the m <dig> genome is  <dig> %, which is remarkably similar to the previously sequenced p. aeruginosa strains pao <dig>  pa <dig>  lesb <dig> and pa <dig>  the genome of the strain m <dig> is made of a single chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp in size, which is slightly larger than the  <dig> , <dig> bp of strain pao <dig>  <cit> , but relatively smaller than the  <dig> , <dig> bp of strain pa <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> , <dig> bp of lesb <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> , <dig> bp of strain pa <dig>  <cit> . the m <dig> genome was annotated to contain  <dig>  open reading frames  and  <dig> rna genes, which represent 89% of the total genomic dna. using the mgenomesubtractor online software  <cit> , we found that the genome similarity among these five p. aeruginosa strains is very high; however  <dig> orfs in the m <dig> genome,  <dig> orfs in pao <dig>   <dig> orfs in pa <dig>   <dig> orfs in lesb <dig> and  <dig> orfs in pa <dig> are strain-specific under the threshold of  <dig>  of identity or  <dig>  of match length/query length. the strain specific genes contained in the m <dig> genome are listed in additional file  <dig>  these results indicated that the available genomes of p. aeruginosa strains originating from both clinical and environmental sources contain a highly conserved core genome in large than 90% of orfs, with several accessory regions in less than 10% of orfs remarkably varied depending on their different environmental niches .

a the strain-specific coding sequences  were predicted by proteins with low similarity to the other four sequenced p. aeruginosa strain genomes  using the mgenomesubtractor  <cit> .

b cds assigned function was based on the cogs according to rps-blast  <cit> .

global alignments were performed by the mumer software  <cit> , and the results showed that the large segment inversion of the chromosome by recombination between the rrna and rrnb genes was found in the m <dig> genome, as well as in other p. aeruginosa strains lesb <dig>  pa <dig> and pa <dig>  in comparison with that in pao <dig> genome sequenced by the seattle consortium  <cit> . interestingly, the inversion also exists in different pao <dig> sublines which are studied and stored in german and american laboratories, and the phenotypes among the pao <dig> sublines are also different  <cit> . this suggests that some physiological consequences occur among the pao <dig> sublines and other p. aeruginosa strains because of the inversion  <cit> .

the comparison of the m <dig> genome and the other available p. aeruginosa genomes with regards to the functional category breakdown of coding sequences   <cit>  shows a similar distribution in most groups, but the two strains m <dig> and lesb <dig> show a greater degree of similarity than others, including a similar number of genes related to dna replication, recombination and repair, the transport of inorganic ions and amino acids, amino acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis, transport and catabolism of secondary metabolites . this suggests that the two strains share a common ancestor as they have the closest relationship in comparison with all other sequenced p. aeruginosa strains. the phylogenetic tree was further generated by maximum parsimony  method, using  <dig> phylogenetic useful genes in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the result confirmed that the strain m <dig> is the closest relative to strain lesb <dig> among the sequence available p. aeruginosa strains, as shown in figure 3a. we also found that nine out of eleven o-antigen loci in the strain m <dig> share more than 95% similarity to the serotype o <dig> loci in lesb <dig>  <cit> , indicating that m <dig> may carry a similar serotype o <dig> o-antigen. based on these sequence data, the strain m <dig> is now designated as p. aeruginosa m <dig>  a new isolate of p. aeruginosa.

genomic islands and prophages
in comparison with other sequenced nosocomial p. aeruginosa genomes, the unique regions of genomic plasticity were predicted in the m <dig> genome, including five specific genomic islands  designated mgi-i to v and two novel prophages, i and ii. the general features of these gis and prophages in the strain m <dig> are summarized in figure 4a and additional file  <dig>  however, we have not found homologies of the pathogenic islands against mammals such as papi- <dig>  <cit> , papi- <dig>  <cit> , pagi- <dig>  <cit> , lesgi- <dig>  <cit> , in the m <dig> genome.

to the best of our knowledge, the two gis, mgi-i and mgi-ii are initially found in p. aeruginosa m <dig>  and share 38% identity with that in pseudomonas putida gb- <dig> and 55% with nitrosomonas europaea atcc  <dig>  respectively. the gc content of mgi-i  and mgi-ii  are quite lower than the average gc content  of the m <dig> genome. difference in the percentage of gc content between the gis and the core genome is considered as an important marker of horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that these two gis are associated with recently acquired genetic material. mgi-i contains two genes  that code for putative integrases, and mgi-ii contains a gene  that encodes a putative transposase. mgi-i contains another two genes, mod  and res , which encode two subunits of the type iii restriction-modification  system. mgi-ii contains another three genes, hsdr , hsdm  and hsds  that code for all the three subunits in the multifunctional type i rm system which quite differ from the two type i rm systems in the pa <dig> genome. these two restriction systems contained in a single m <dig> genome can be predicated to assist this strain in digesting foreign genetic material  <cit> , which may explain why p. aeruginosa m <dig> has proven to be recalcitrant to the introduction of foreign dna and to keep the strain isolated from others within rhizosphere niches.

the gc content of mgi-iii  is similar to that of the average content in the m <dig> genome. mgi-iii contains a plt synthetic gene cluster with its two flanking regulatory genes and transporter gene cluster   <cit>  and shares 99% nucleotide sequence identity with the lesgi- <dig> sequence in lesb <dig>  suggesting that the two islands may originate from the same genetic source and remain in the two genomes. however, lesgi- <dig> contains a frameshift mutation in pltb of the plt gene cluster  <cit> . the plt synthetic gene cluster is inactivated in strain lesb <dig>  which might the result of the unnecessary plt production in the nosocomial niche. however, plt can be produced in the plant-associated pseudomonads such as strain m <dig>  <cit>  and p. fluorescens pf- <dig>  <cit>  and plays a crucial anti-fungal function to suppress a variety of plant diseases in rhizosphere niches.

the gc content of mgi-iv  and mgi-v  is closer to the average content of the m <dig> genome than those of mgi-i and mgi-ii, indicating that the two islands may be not the recently acquired genetic materials. a homologous sequence of mgi-iv was found in p. aeruginosa pak  <cit> . the mgi-iv contains genes encoding acetyltransferase, 3-demethylubiquinone- <dig> -methyltransferase, cmp-2-keto-3- deoxyoctulosonic acid synthetase, phenylpropionate dioxygenase, ring-hydroxylating related dioxygenases, and nucleotide sugar transaminase, which are involved in flagellar glycosylation, secondary metabolite synthesis, and redox reaction in the rhizosphere environment. the mgi-v is a novel genomic island which has never been found in other prokaryotic genomes. the gene  in this island encodes a putative cytochrome p <dig>  which can catalyze the oxidation of several metabolic intermediates, such as lipids and steroidal hormones, as well as xenobiotic substances, including drugs and other toxic chemicals  <cit> . the two genomic islands in the m <dig> genome may assist the strain m <dig> to utilize various substances and degrade environmental toxic materials and pollutants in the complex rhizosphere environment.

two novel prophages named prophage i and ii were found in the m <dig> genome. each of the prophage contains a putative chitinase gene  and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
a striking feature in the m <dig> genome is the least number and diversity of  <dig> is elements named is <dig> , ispa <dig>  and ispa <dig>  as shown in figure 4b). however, the other completely sequenced p. aeruginosa strains, pao <dig>  pa <dig>  pa <dig>  and lesb <dig> carry  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is elements, respectively . to our knowledge, the is elements are postulated to be important drivers of many bacterial genome evolution, such as xanthomonas  <cit> . in addition to serving as vectors for lateral gene transfer, is elements can generate other types of genome modification, including rearrangements, inversions and deletions, any of which can increase the instability of the bacterial genome. therefore, the least number of is elements in the genome indicates the relative genome stability of the strain m <dig> in the rhizosphere niches.

as predicted by the crisprfinder  <cit> , three crispr elements were found in the m <dig> genome . crispr  <dig> element is  <dig> bp in length and has  <dig> spacers each flanked by a  <dig> bp direct repeat . there is one single similar crispr element in the lesb <dig> genome, in which six spacers are different from the crispr  <dig> element. the crispr  <dig> element consists of  <dig> bp with  <dig> spacers each flanked by  <dig> bp dr, and the crispr <dig> is  <dig> bp in length with  <dig> spacers and  <dig> bp dr. the crispr  <dig> and  <dig> sequences are similar to those in the pa <dig> genome, which only has the two homologies. furthermore, most of spacers in the crispr  <dig> and  <dig> elements are quite different from those in other p. aeruginosa strains. the strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> only carry some questionable crispr elements that have borderline sequence identity. the three crispr elements in the m <dig> genome can be found dispersedly in other sequenced p. aeruginosa genomes, indicating that the m <dig> genome contains the most number of crispr elements among the five available complete p. aeruginosa genomes. the different spacer sequences in the three crispr loci of the strain m <dig> indicate that m <dig> has developed specific features to combat various phage invasions in the rhizosphere environment, as spacer sequences are known to be critical for bacteria to resist foreign phage invasion  <cit> .

biocontrol-related gene clusters with their products
we identified six secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, which are related to biocontrol activities of the strain m <dig>  and responsible for biosynthesis of two siderophores, hydrogen cyanide, plt and pca . among them, two gene clusters are responsible for the biosynthesis of two siderophores, including pyoverdine  and pyochelin , respectively, which have been demonstrated to suppress target phytopathogens in the rhizosphere through iron competition  <cit> . the hcn cluster responsible for the production of hydrogen cyanide  is highly conserved in different p. aeruginosa strains. the plt biosynthesis gene cluster is located in mgi-iii and has been described above. the remaining two gene clusters are responsible for pca biosynthesis. the two phz gene clusters in the genome of the strain m <dig> are highly conserved and share 99% homologous sequences to those in the p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  each of which consists of seven genes , named phza1-g <dig> and phza2-g <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the genes that flank these two clusters are also the same to those of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  however, there is a  <dig> bp intergenic region located directly downstream of the phza2-g <dig> gene cluster between the phzg <dig> gene and the orf  in the strain m <dig>  compared to a shorter  <dig> bp sequence in the strain pao <dig> and a relatively longer  <dig> bp sequence in the lesb <dig> genome. all these interval regions are consisted of clustered short repeats, although their function remains unknown.

the predominant phenazine produced in strain m <dig> is pca, especially at 28°c, rather than pyo produced in other nosocomial originating p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> . both pca and plt compounds produced by fluorescent pseudomonas species are considered to play an important role in microbial competitiveness and combating plant pathogens  <cit> . to our knowledge, the strain m <dig> is the first strain that was reported to produce both pca and plt simultaneously, and the synergistic antibiotic effect of pca and plt can result in strong activity to protect plants from fungal phytopathogen infections. it has been found that the wild-type strain m <dig> has much greater effective inhibitory activity against various mycelium plug growths than either the single pca or plt null mutants on the pda plate . we purified the two compounds of pca and plt individually from liquid culture, and measured the antifungal activities of the single compound and the combinations of various weight ratios of the two compounds against rhizoctonia solani mycelium plug growth on pda plates, respectively. the 50% value of efficient control  is  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml for single pca and plt, respectively. however, the ec <dig> of the two compound combination at a weight ratio of  <dig> to  <dig> at ph  <dig>  drops to  <dig>  μg/ml only, indicating a significant synergistic effect of pca and plt combination on fungal inhibition. the combinations of the two antibiotics may play a crucial role for the strain m <dig> to protect the plant against different phytopathogen infections.

virulence-related genes against mammals
besides the virulence related genes located in the accessory genome, the lesb <dig> genome contains all of the  <dig> genes described for pao <dig> with the exception of pa <dig>  and pa <dig>  <cit> . based on the vfdb database  <cit> , we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> virulence genes in the m <dig> genome are quite different from those of lesb <dig> after blastp searching . firstly, six genes in the m <dig> genome  share less than 70% identity with the genes in lesb <dig>  which are involved in the synthesis of flagellum components and related to bacterial motility and biofilm formation. furthermore, the flagellum of the strain lesb <dig> belongs to a member of b-type because it lacks flagellar glycosylation, and the flagellum of the strain m <dig> may belong to the a-type resulted by the flagellar glycosylation function of mgi-iv in the m <dig> genome. these differences may give rise to different ability of bacterial biofilm formation and induce different mammalian immune system between the two strains. secondly, five out of  <dig> pyoverdine synthesis-associated genes, which are involved in the iron uptake and cytotoxic due to its ability to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> , are quite different between the two strains. the gene pvds  is completely absent in the m <dig> genome. notably, there are three copies of fpva  and pvde  in the lesb <dig> genome  <cit> , but only one copy of fpva  and pvde  in the m <dig> genome; the two genes have only  <dig> % and  <dig> % sequence identity, respectively, to those in lesb <dig>  furthermore, pvdd  and pvdj , which are predicted to encode the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase in the pyoverdine synthesis pathway, have only  <dig> % and  <dig> % sequence identity to those in lesb <dig>  respectively.

a virulence genes in p. aeruginosa lesb <dig> were identified based on the vfdb database  <cit> . divergent genes were identified by a blastp search under the expected level of 75% for identity or  <dig>  for match length/query length.

b "-" indicates no homologous was found in the m <dig> genome.

in the lesb <dig> genome, the ppka gene  codes a positive regulator of type vi secretion system  <cit> , and the gene leca  codes a factor which plays an important role in biofilm formation and adherence to mammalian cells  <cit> . however, both of the two homologous ppka and leca ofrs  in m <dig> genome are truncated because of a stop codon located in the middle of the two orfs.

the m <dig> genome carries a gene cluster responsible for lipopolysaccharide  o-antigen serotype o <dig> biosynthesis  <cit> , which shares larger than 90% identity with that in lesb <dig>  interestingly, the gmd gene within the lps biosynthesis gene cluster coding for gdp-mannose  <dig> -dehydratase is a pseudogene in the lesb <dig> genome  <cit> . however, the gmd gene  was found to be a true gene in the m <dig> genome, although the association with the virulence and o-antigen deficiency remains unclear.

attenuated competitive activity of the strain m <dig> in a mouse model of acute lung infection
the different genome structures, especially the different mammalian virulence related genes, prompted us to make a comparison of the infectious activities between the two closely related strains m <dig> and lesb <dig> in a mammal model in vivo. thus, we measured the competitive index  of the paired strains to assess their different ability in growth and maintenance in an acute mouse lung infection model . equal ratio of the two strains was adjusted in phosphate buffered saline , and the mixture was inoculated into the mouse lung via the nostril. bacteria were enumerated in the lung tissue at  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-infection. the geometric mean ci values were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the results showed that the strain m <dig> was easier to be erased than the strain lesb <dig> in all of the  <dig> tested mice, and the growth and maintenance abilities of the m <dig> strain were more attenuated after a prolonged duration of inoculation than lesb <dig>  the preliminary results indicated that the strain lesb <dig> is more difficult to be erased than the strain m <dig> in the acute mouse lung infection mode. further experiments are now being carried out in this laboratory to elucidate the virulence activities of the strain m <dig> against humans and animal cell lines, and to identify the relationship between the virulence gene expression profiles of the m <dig> genome in the mouse lung and the responses of mammalian immune system.

antimicrobial agent resistance spectrum
the minimal inhibitory concentration  of antimicrobial agents against the two strains m <dig> and lesb <dig> were listed in table  <dig>  the strain m <dig> is phenotypically resistant to several antimicrobial agents including penicillins, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and macrolides, which is the same as the reported p. aeruginosa strains  <cit> . the genomic analysis indicated that the strain m <dig> carries a β-lactamase gene ampc  and other eight putative β-lactamase genes , which are responsible for encoding enzymes resistant to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . furthermore, the m <dig> genome contains several gene clusters encoding proteins to constitute efflux pumps, such as mexab-oprm   <cit> , mexcd-oprj   <cit> , and mexef-oprn   <cit> , which result in resistance to many antimicrobial agents including chloramphenicol, aminoglycoside, macrolides and rifampicin. except the aztreonam, the strain m <dig> is susceptible to most of the clinically applied antimicrobial agents against p. aeruginosa, including third-generation cephalosporins , carbapenems , monobactam , polymyxin  and tobramycin. however, comparing with the strain lesb <dig>  the strain m <dig> is slightly more susceptible to imipenem and meropenem.

interestingly, compared with p. aeruginosa lesb <dig>  the strain m <dig> is more susceptible to several antimicrobial agents, such as gentamycin, kanamycin and ofloxacin. quinolone resistance is usually present in p. aeruginosa strains because of two point mutations in gyra and parc in the genome, respectively  <cit> . the lack of the two point mutations in the m <dig> genome can be postulated to responsible for quinolone susceptibility of the strain m <dig>  therefore, the results suggest that the rhizosphere isolate m <dig> has not evolved specific mechanisms including point mutation or acquisition resistant plasmid to resist antimicrobial agents, unlike nosocomial p. aeruginosa strains that face lethal antimicrobial agents stress.

genomic microarray based transcriptome analysis
measurement of gene expression levels at two temperatures, 28°c and 37°c, was performed using an oligonucleotide agilent microarray based on the m <dig> genome sequence to specify the temperature-dependent expression profiles of this strain. we selected 28°c as a temperature representative for the rhizosphere niches and 37°c for the human body. the results from the temperature-dependent transcriptome analysis were consistent with our previously published data that the expression of phzm, ptsp and lasi gene is up-regulated at 37°c  <cit> . the comparative analysis of the m <dig> genome expressional profiles at 28°c and 37°c indicated that the expression levels of a total of  <dig> genes at 28°c are regulated over two-fold that at 37°c. it shows that a total of  <dig> % of the expressed genes in m <dig> genome are temperature-dependent .

in comparison with gene expression level at 37°c, the transcriptional expression levels of  <dig> genes are up-regulated by approximately two-fold at 28°c, including  <dig> genes with known functions and  <dig> functions unknown genes. among these,  <dig> function known genes are sorted into nine gene families . surprisingly,  <dig> of these genes are contained in the m <dig> gis and prophage, of which eight genes are located in prophage i, two genes are involved in the type i restriction-modification system in mgi-ii, seven genes are related to the pyoluteorin transporter in mgi-iii, and seven genes in mgi-v are associated with the synthesis of cytochrome p <dig>  we also found that other up-regulated operons are involved in energy production and the conversion of tca cycle-related oxidative phosphorylation, aromatic amino acid and benzonate degradation, and phosphate uptake. besides the operons, a potential phenazine modifying enzyme, phzh, a gene that encoded quorum sensing  signal molecule n-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone synthetase, rhli, and a gene that encoded the qs repressor, qscr, are promoted at 28°c. the other genes, which are not located in these operons, could be assigned to various functions, including phage-related, fes cluster assembly, glyoxylate metabolism, benzonate degradation, copper resistance, and pentose phosphate. hence, the expression levels of these genes involved in antibiotics production, foreign genetic material prevention and nutrient substance degradation are up-regulated at the rhizosphere temperature 28°c, which may give m <dig> an advantage to resistance the rhizosphere environmental stresses.

cells were grown to od <dig> =  <dig> - <dig>   in lb medium at 28°c and 37°c, respectively. the effects on gene expression were monitored by microarray analysis using agilent genechips. shown are genes that were located in genomic islands or are member of gene families in two independent experiments.

in comparison with the gene expression levels at 37°c, a total of  <dig> gene expression levels are down-regulated by approximately two-fold at 28°c;  <dig> of these genes have unknown functions, and  <dig> function known genes are sorted into  <dig> gene families , such as the secretion system, transportation, and ribosomal assembly and etc. these results indicated that the basic protein synthesis, metabolism rate and cell growth rate decrease at the low temperature of 28°c compared to 37°c. strikingly, none of them is located in m <dig> gis or prophages. interestingly, we found that the  <dig> down-regulated genes are predicted to encode several mammalian virulence-related factors, including three genes predicated to encode hcn synthetase, three encode proteins involved in type ii secretion system, eight genes involved in the type iii secretion system, and two genes involved in lasa protease precursor and phospholipase c, respectively.

transcriptome profile analysis based on the m <dig> genomic microarray at the two different temperatures implies that the m <dig> genome has developed its specific features for gene expression to meet the requirement for the competitive fitness and survival in rhizosphere niches except the specific genome structure features.

CONCLUSIONS
the strain m <dig> isolated from the sweet melon rhizosphere in  <dig> in shanghai suburb was named pseudomonas sp. m <dig> because of its effective biocontrol ability and several phenotypic features that are similar to pseudomonas spp.  <cit> . in this study, the complete genome of the strain m <dig> was sequenced and shown to share a common core genome that is comprised of more than 90% genome sequence homology to all other sequenced genomes of p. aeruginosa isolates . based on the comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the m <dig> genome with other p. aeruginosa, the strain m <dig> can now be definitively designated as a new p. aeruginosa strain. the results indicated that the core genome diversity of various p. aeruginosa strains from either nosocomial or rhizosphere niche is quite small in comparison with that of various p. fluorescens strains  <cit> .

however, the various p. aeruginosa strains originating from different environment niches differ in accessory genome regions, genome expression profiles, virulence activities and antibiotic resistances. the analysis of complete m <dig> genome sequence and temperature dependent transcriptional profiles indicated several important features distinguished the strain m <dig> from other nosocomial p. aeruginosa strains. firstly, the m <dig> genome contains several specific accessory regions of genomic plasticity which differ significantly from all sequenced nosocomial isolates. this is the first time to sequence completely a rhizosphere originating p. aeruginosa strain m <dig>  and take it as a model strain to analysis and detail the possible determinants related to its biocontrol activity and living ability in rhizosphere niche. we found that the m <dig> genome contains five specific gis and two novel prophages, which benefit its survival and biocontrol activity in the rhizosphere niches. furthermore, all mammalian pathogenicity-related gis and prophages contained in other sequenced p. aeruginosa strains  <cit>  are absent in m <dig> genome. secondly, fourteen mammalian virulence-related genes are absent or truncated in m <dig> genome, and the competitive index analysis of the strains m <dig> and lesb <dig> indicated the strain m <dig> is easier to be erased than that of lesb <dig> in the acute infection mouse lung model. comparing with the strain lesb <dig>  the strain m <dig> is more susceptible to several antibiotics and antimicrobial agents including kanamycin, gentamycin and ofloxacin. thirdly, the m <dig> genome based microarray profiles revealed that the strain m <dig> has developed its specific temperature-dependent gene expression patterns to meet the requirements of survival and thriving in the rhizosphere niche. especially, we found that none in the gis expressed higher at 37°c than that at 28°c, but  <dig> genes in the gis and prophages are up-regulated at 28°c which is the temperature close to that in rhizosphere niches.

in summary, the rhizosphere originated strain m <dig> has evolved specific genome structures and the temperature dependent expressional patterns to meet the requirement of fitness and survival under the selective pressure imposed on it. therefore, the specific interesting features found in m <dig> genome and transcriptome profiles may provide us several cues to design therapeutic strategies against p. aeruginosa infection, and assist us to develop the strain m <dig> or other rhizosphere originating strains as a safety cell factory for the industrial purposes to produce antifungal compounds or other secondary metabolites through genetically engineered modification.
