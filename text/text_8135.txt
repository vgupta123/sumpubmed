BACKGROUND
the cd <dig> family includes genes encoding cd163a , cd163b  and cd163c-α . this family is a subset of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich  super-family, an ancient super-family defined by the presence of 100- <dig> amino acid domains  <cit> . members of the cd <dig> family are group b srcr proteins distinguished by the 6- <dig> cysteines in their srcr domains resulting in 3- <dig> disulfide bonds; in comparison, group a srcr proteins have only  <dig> cysteines and  <dig> disulfide bonds in their srcr domains. srcr domains, like ig domains or epidermal growth factor-like domains, are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions, although the known ligands of these domains vary widely.

cd163a is a receptor for haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes, and is inducibly expressed on monocytes, macrophages and a subpopulation of hematopoietic progenitors  <cit> . cd163a protects against oxidative damage by mediating the endocytosis of haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes  <cit> . ligation of cd163a by haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes induces the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, proteolytically-cleaved cd163a shed into serum inhibits phorbol ester-induced t cell proliferation  <cit> . the third srcr domain of cd163a mediates its interaction with haptoglobin and tweak   <cit> . cd163a interacts with a molecule expressed on erythroblasts and with bacteria via its second srcr domain  <cit> . the related group b srcr molecule cd <dig> also binds to bacteria via one or more of its srcr domains, through interactions with the bacterial non-peptiditic products lipoteichoic acid  and lipopolysaccharide   <cit> .

cd163a transcripts display alternative splicing of the extracellular and cytoplasmic coding regions, potentially increasing the diversity of its function  <cit> . the cd163a form with a short cytoplasmic domain predominates and mediates ligand internalization and degradation but the function of the cd163a form with a long cytoplasmic domain is unknown  <cit> . cross-linking of cd163a induces inositol triphosphate and cytokine production  <cit> . the cd163a cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated by casein kinase ii and protein kinase c-α  and these phosphorylation events are tied to cytokine production induced by cd163a cross-linking  <cit> . casein kinase ii activity and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages is stimulated by cd163a binding to only one of the two alleles of haptoglobin, although both bind to cd163a with high affinity  <cit> . the non-stimulatory haptoglobin allele is correlated with increased susceptibility to cardiovascular disease  <cit> .

cd163b is also expressed on macrophages, with two cytoplasmic domain variants of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, resulting from alternative splicing  <cit> . little is known about the function or ligand of cd163b. thus far, the gene encoding cd163b has only been found in the genomes of primates and the horse.

unlike cd163a, which is encoded by one gene across eutherian mammals, several species possess multiple genes encoding cd163c-α molecules. there are two cd163c-α genes in mice: scart <dig> and scart <dig>  scart <dig> is expressed in the lymph node, trachea and lung; scart <dig> is expressed on murine γδ t cells that secrete il- <dig>  <cit> . the presence of multiple genes encoding the srcr transmembrane receptor cd163c-α is similar to that of another set of group b srcr proteins, wc <dig>  genes encoding wc <dig> have been found in the artiodactyl species cattle , sheep  and swine   <cit> . wc <dig> molecules are encoded by a family of fifteen genes in the bovine and, like scart <dig>  are expressed on γδ t cells  <cit> . wc <dig> contributes to the γδ t cell response to leptospira  and wc1-mediated potentiation of t cell activation requires the phosphorylation of a tyrosine in its cytoplasmic domain  <cit> . moreover, expression of different molecular forms of wc <dig> on bovine γδ t cells is correlated with differential response to bacteria, suggesting that wc <dig> functions as a pattern recognition molecule similar to the related srcr molecules cd163a, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  spα and dmbt <dig>  <cit> . no wc <dig> homologues have thus far been identified in human or murine γδ t cells, leading to the question of whether cd <dig> family members, particularly cd163c-α molecules, have evolved to serve functions equivalent to wc <dig> in mammals other than the artiodactyls.

in our recent annotation of the bovine genome we found the gene encoding cd163a embedded within the region coding for wc <dig> genes  <cit> . to determine the extent of the cd <dig> family in artiodactyls, we annotated the bovine genome to identify cd <dig> family genes in cattle. we found genes encoding both cd163a and cd163c-α, but not cd163b, and evaluated their expression profile in γδ t cells and other tissues. incorrect assignment of genes belonging to the cd <dig> and the wc <dig> families from many species has created substantial confusion in naming and categorizing these genes. to appropriately categorize the genes identified both by us and by others, we undertook phylogenetic analyses of cd <dig> and wc <dig> family members. here, we show the relationship between cd163a, cd163c-α and wc <dig> family receptors, all expressed in γδ t cells of artiodactyls, that wc <dig> orthologues are present in the chicken and platypus, and correlate the conservation over evolutionary time of a diverse array of these receptors with the presence of a high level of γδ t cells in the peripheral blood.

RESULTS
exon-intron structure of bovine cd <dig> family members
annotation of the bovine genome indicated that cattle have a gene coding for cd163a, which was found on chromosome  <dig> within one of the two loci coding for the large wc <dig> family of genes  <cit> . a gene coding for bovine cd163c-α was also found but could not be placed in the bovine genome due to insufficient scaffolding. schematics of the exon-intron structure of these two genes are shown in fig.  <dig>  both cd163a and cd163c-α contain a cytoplasmic domain coded for by two exons, one of which also encodes the transmembrane domain. interestingly, like wc <dig>  both cd163a and cd163c-α contain an exon that encodes interdomain sequence   <cit> . the gene encoding cd163a spans approximately  <dig> kbp; that of cd163c-α spans approximately  <dig> kbp.

the cd163c-α amino acid sequence generated by automated prediction lacked a transmembrane region that was correlated with a gap in the genomic sequence at the expected location of the exon encoding the transmembrane domain . we investigated whether bovine cd163c-α has a transmembrane domain by amplifying and sequencing cdna template from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using primers designed from known sequences in the genomic sequence, which bracketed the putative transmembrane region. we obtained transmembrane domain sequence in the same frame as known sequence upstream and downstream , indicating that the bovine cd163c-α is a transmembrane receptor. the bovine homologue of the human gene encoding cd163b was not found in the bovine genome assembly btau  <dig> , which could reflect its absence or a relatively large gap in the sequenced bovine genome.

bovine cd <dig> sequences
based on the manual annotation of the bovine cd163c-α and cd163a gene sequences , we designed primers to amplify cd163a and cd163c-α transcripts. deduced amino acid sequences based on the obtained cdna sequence of cd163a  and on both the annotated genomic sequence and obtained cdna sequence  of cd163c-α  were used to evaluate their predicted protein structures. bovine cd163a has nine srcr domains and bovine cd163c-α has eight srcr domains in their extracellular regions, which are underlined in the predicted protein . most of the srcr domains conform to the eight-cysteine consensus of srcr group b. the exceptions are the eighth srcr domain of bovine cd163a and the fifth srcr domain of bovine cd163c-α. these srcr domains lack the second and seventh cysteines, which form a disulfide bond in most, but not all, other srcr group b domains. estimates of the evolutionary divergence between srcr domain amino acid sequences confirm that bovine cd163a is most similar to human cd163a  and that bovine cd163c-α is most similar to human cd163c-α  in both the order of srcr domains and sequence identity. bovine cd163a is identical to human cd163a in its srcr domain organization, and highly similar in its sequence with 82% overall sequence identity. bovine cd163c-α is identical to human cd163c-α in its srcr domain organization and 68% identical in overall sequence. the evolutionary divergence between bovine cd163a or bovine cd163c-α srcr domains and bovine wc <dig> srcr domains is greater , indicating that the genes we have identified as bovine cd163a or bovine cd163c-α are not wc <dig> genes. the sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of cd163c-α and cd163a from cattle do not exhibit significant sequence identity to each other , although they contain the tyrosine-based motifs of yedi and yrem respectively.

the number of amino acid differences per site from analysis between sequences is shown. all results are based on the pairwise analysis of  <dig> sequences. standard error estimates are shown in parentheses and were obtained by using analytical formulas. analyses were conducted using the amino p-distance model in mega <dig>  <cit> . all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset . there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. estimates below  <dig>  are in boldtype, and values on the diagonal corresponding to a high level of identity between sequences are underlined. srcr domains are labelled with alphabetical designations as previously defined and by inferring the evolutionary relationships between srcr domains using the neighbor-joining and bayesian methods  <cit> .

analyses were conducted as described in table  <dig>

expression profiles of bovine cd163a and cd163c-α
a variety of tissues were examined for expression of bovine cd <dig> transcripts including mesenteric lymph node , lung, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes  and peripheral blood mononuclear cells . pbmc were evaluated both as ex vivo cells and following activation by con a. based on expressed sequence tag  analysis in the ncbi unigene database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=unigene, it was predicted that bovine cd163c-α is expressed in the intestine and that bovine cd163a is expressed in the intestine and mesenteric lymph node . interestingly, we found cd163a to be expressed in all tissues evaluated  and not just in intestine and mln. surprisingly, we found that cd163a is also expressed on wc1+ and γδ tcr+ as well as wc1- and γδ tcr- cells sorted from ex vivo pbmc  indicating that the expression of bovine cd163a is not restricted to monocytes and macrophages, as is the case in humans  <cit> .

we found that cd163c-α transcripts were relatively higher in pbmc, mln and iels, than in lung , consistent with expression in leukocytes. the cd163c-α family member scart <dig> has been shown to be expressed in murine γδ t cells  <cit> . to test the hypothesis that bovine cd163c-α is expressed on a t cell subset separate from the wc1+ γδ t cell subset, we evaluated the expression of bovine cd163c-α on wc1+, wc1-, γδ tcr+ and γδ tcr- cells sorted from ex vivo pbmc . we found that cd163c-α was preferentially expressed in the wc1+ or γδ tcr+ cell populations in pbmc, suggesting that it increases the potential receptor repertoire of wc1+γδ t cells.

analysis of cd <dig> and wc <dig> srcr domains
we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of cd <dig> family members and their closest molecular relative, wc <dig>  with the goal of understanding the evolution and function of wc <dig> and cd <dig> family members. we performed multiple alignments of individual srcr domains in bovine cd163c-α and bovine cd163a with defined srcr domains from bovine wc <dig> and human cd163a  <cit> . the srcr domains from bovine wc <dig> and human cd163a have previously been assigned an alphabet letter designation "a", "b", "c", "d", "d' ", "e", "h", "i", "j", or "k"  <cit> . srcr domains in bovine cd163c-α and bovine cd163a that clustered in the same clades as these previously designated srcr domains  were assigned the same designation. srcr domains that clustered in separate clades from the clades containing already designated srcr domains were assigned the new alphabet letter designations "m", "n" and "l" . phylograms obtained using bayesian analysis  showed that the first srcr domain of bovine cd163c-α  and the first srcr domains of cd163c-α-like molecules from the duck-billed platypus  are in the same clade as the first srcr domain of primate, rodent and canine cd163c-α . the clade containing the fifth srcr domain  in bovine cd163c-α also includes srcr domains from cd163c-α-like molecules from eutherian mammals, the duck-billed platypus and the chicken . the second srcr domain of bovine cd163c-α  clusters in the same clade as other srcr domains designated "l" from eutherian mammals and the duck-billed platypus . srcr domains that we have designated as "d" are clustered in sister clades to defined "d" srcr domains by bayesian analysis: however, their designation as domain "d" is also supported by their position in the protein in reference to other srcr domains . several srcr domains from chicken cd <dig> molecules clustered apart from the "d" srcr domain; although, their identification as "d" srcr domains is suggested by their position in the protein . these srcr domains were left undesignated . the first six srcr domains of human cd163b do not reproducibly cluster in the same clade as other defined srcr domains and were also left undesignated . notably, cd163b has thus far been found only in primates and horses. it is also of note that srcr domain "k", which appears to be diagnostic of cd163a or cd163b, does not appear in any of the annotated genes from the duck-billed platypus or the chicken, suggesting that cd163a or cd163b is not encoded in these animals' genomes. thus, there appear to be at least  <dig> types of cd <dig> family members, not all of which appear in every species, and some of which are duplicated within a species: cd163a, cd163b, cd163c-α, and wc <dig> 

most of the cd <dig> molecules, especially those with a transmembrane domain, contain the usually membrane proximal "d' " and "e" srcr domains . these domains from chicken and duck-billed platypus cluster together within each species, whereas cd163a "d' " and "e" srcr domains from eutherian mammals are found in separate sub-clades from cd163b, cd163c-α, and wc <dig> "d' " and "e" srcr domains from eutherian mammals .

relationship of cd163c-α and wc1
the relationship of cd163c-α to wc <dig> is particularly intriguing since wc <dig> expression is restricted to γδ t cells and cd163c-α expression is enriched in wc1+γδ t cells . when we performed a multiple srcr domain alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of cd <dig> proteins across multiple species, we found that the srcr domain structure and organization of bovine cd163c-α  is most similar to cd163c-α from other eutherian mammalian species, such as human, chimpanzee, dog, and mouse and rat. the srcr domains "m" and "l" and "n" were unique to cd163c-α molecules and were not found to occur in bovine or swine wc <dig>  nor did they occur in the other cd <dig> family members cd163a or human cd163b . domains "m", "l", and "n" clustered in separate clades than the wc <dig> domain "a", as well as from the first six srcr domains from cd163b and srcr domains "h", "i", "j", and "k" from cd163a .

the chicken and the duck-billed platypus possess more cd <dig> genes than primates, dogs or rodents, displaying a diverse repertoire more similar to that seen with wc <dig> genes in the artiodactyls. the chicken possesses at least eighteen cd <dig> genes while the duck-billed platypus has at least ten cd <dig> genes. seven of the chicken cd <dig> genes and three of the duck-billed platypus cd <dig> genes contained srcr domains that clustered in the clade containing wc <dig> srcr domain "a" . this is notable because domain "a" is the source of most of the diversity in wc <dig> family members and is thus thought to be the most likely srcr domain to be responsible for wc <dig> isoform-specific function  <cit> . chicken cd163_ <dig> and platypus cd163_ <dig> were the closest to bovine wc <dig> in extracellular srcr organization, with srcr domain organization of  and , respectively, compared to the bovine wc <dig> srcr domain organization of  . six chicken cd <dig> proteins show a hybrid srcr domain organization that is intermediate between wc <dig> and cd163c-α, with the srcr domain "a" diagnostic of wc <dig> and srcr domain "n" diagnostic of cd163c-α. for example, chicken cd163_ <dig> and cd163_ <dig> possess a n-terminal domain "a" characteristic of wc <dig> but an srcr domain cassette  characteristic of cd163c-α. in contrast, cd <dig> molecules from the duck-billed platypus contain either the wc1- diagnostic domain "a", or cd163c-α-diagnostic domains "m","l", or "n", but not both.

the consensus group b srcr domain contains eight cysteines, with disulfide bonds formed between the first and fourth, the second and seventh, the third and eighth, and the fifth and sixth cysteines  <cit> . some of the srcr domains lack the second and/or the seventh cysteine, which results in a predicted srcr domain with only three disulfide bonds rather than four disulfide bonds. however, mmscart2_srcr <dig> , gg_1srcr <dig> , gg_4srcr <dig> , gg_5srcr <dig> , oracd163_3srcr <dig> , oracd163_7srcr <dig> , oracd163_9srcr <dig> , and oracd163_6srcr <dig>  are missing additional cysteines resulting in srcr-like domains with only one to three potential disulfide bonds. it is not known how these changes will affect srcr domain structure and function.

relationship of cytoplasmic sequences
several of the wc1-like or cd163-α-like molecules from chicken or duck-billed platypus do not have transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains; although, they are predicted open reading frames from genomic sequence and may not be complete. the cytoplasmic domain of chicken cd163_ <dig>  defined as being c-terminal to a transmembrane domain, is unusual in that it is not similar in sequence to other cd <dig> family members, but instead contains a srcr domain . the cytoplasmic domains of bovine or human cd163a or human cd163b do not have any significant sequence identity with the cytoplasmic domains of cd163c-α-like or wc1-like molecules; although bovine and human cd163a have the tyrosine-based motif yrem in their cytoplasmic domains . we performed multiple amino acid alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of the other cytoplasmic domains of cd163c-α-like and wc <dig> molecules and found that the cytoplasmic domains from canine clfcd163_ <dig>  chicken and platypus cd <dig> molecules cluster more closely with the cytoplasmic domains of bovine and swine wc <dig>  than with the cytoplasmic domains of canine clfcd163_ <dig>  primate, bovine, and rodent cd163c-α .


strikingly, all cd163c-α-like molecules from primate, canine, rodent, bovine, monotreme and bird species share a y--- motif with wc <dig>  with the exception of chicken cd163_ <dig>  which has a threonine in place of the isoleucine or leucine . phosphorylation of the yeel tyrosine motif in wc <dig> is required for its potentiation of t cell activation, suggesting that wc <dig> and cd163c-α may signal via the same mechanism  <cit> .

discussion
many genes that have been predicted to belong to the cd <dig> family have been erroneously classified as cd163a or cd163b homologues in their entrez gene reports. for example, clfcd163_ <dig>  rncd163c-α and mmscart <dig> are referred to as similar to m <dig> or cd163l <dig>  which are alternative names for cd163b, despite their greater similarity to cd163c-α in their srcr identity and organization and in their cytoplasmic domain sequence. ggcd163_ <dig> is referred to as cd5-like, despite showing greater sequence similarity to cd163c-α than cd <dig>  other genes from the chicken and platypus that are most similar to cd163c-α and wc <dig> are referred to as similar to cd163v <dig> and cd163v <dig>  which are names for alternatively spliced isoforms of cd163a. it has been speculated that the plethora of cd <dig> molecules in the platypus are cd163a homologues important for regulating blood serum levels of free hemoglobin, instead of cd163c-α or wc <dig> homologues, which are more likely to be involved in the immune response  <cit> . in this study, we show that these genes encode cd163c-α, wc <dig>  or cd163c-α/wc1-like proteins, based on the sequence of their srcr and/or cytoplasmic domains. genes coding for wc1-like proteins in non-artiodactyls have not been previously identified. srcr domains "e " and "d' "  and cytoplasmic domains  that are common to many cd <dig> molecules across species cluster in sub-clades characterized by eutherian mammalian, platypus or chicken origin, suggesting that gene conversion in multi-gene families over millions of years of evolution has driven homogeneity  <cit> . artiodactyls, platypus and chicken all display an expansion of wc1/cd163c-α-like genes . the platypus and the chicken do not have a cd163a gene, suggesting that cd163a has evolved since the divergence of eutherian mammals from monotremes. in contrast, eutherian mammals have one cd163a gene and non-artiodactyl eutherian mammals have a maximum of two cd163c-α genes. this suggests that expression of multiple wc1/cd163c-α genes is the ancestral state and that eutherian mammals other than artiodactyls have lost multiple wc1/cd163c-α genes, since mammals diverged from the sauropsid lineage leading to birds and reptiles  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in a similar finding, the platypus, sheep and cow share an expansion of the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide gene family, whereas primates and rodents have only a single cathelicidin gene  <cit> . the primate or rodent cathelicidin must function equivalently to the plethora of cathelicidins in the platypus or ruminants; analogously, the one or two cd163c-α molecules in non-artiodactyl eutherian mammals may fulfil a function like that of wc <dig>  in regulating the γδ t cell response.

chickens, cattle and sheep are known to have a high percentage of γδ t cells in their peripheral blood. they are referred to as "γδ t cell high" species. in contrast, mice and humans have lower numbers of γδ t cells in their peripheral blood and are referred to as "γδ t cell low" species  <cit> . it is not known whether the duck-billed platypus is a γδ t cell high or γδ t cell low species, but it does possess γδ t cells  <cit> . we show that the chicken and platypus have multiple cd163c-α/wc1-like genes, a circumstance that is similar to the multiple wc <dig> genes in the genomes of the artiodactyls. we hypothesize that a diverse array of cd163c-α/wc <dig> srcr transmembrane receptors conveys a selective advantage to the immune response to pathogens by γδ t cells and that wc <dig> and cd163c-α genes have been conserved because they play an important role in the response to pathogens.

phosphorylation of the second tyrosine in the wc <dig> cytoplasmic domain is required for wc1-mediated potentiation of t cell activation though the tcr, thus, the conservation of this motif in wc1-like and cd163c-α-like genes over millions of years of evolution supports our hypothesis that cd163c-α plays a role similar to wc <dig> as a co-receptor to an activating receptor  <cit> . in contrast, it is unknown if the tyrosine-based motif yrem in cd163a of human or cattle is a phosphorylation target or whether it participates in membrane proximal signaling by cd163a after ligation of this receptor. phosphorylation of cd163a by the serine/threonine kinases casein kinase ii and protein kinase c-α  is tied to cytokine production induced by cd163a cross-linking  <cit> . detection of transcripts for bovine cd163a in sorted wc <dig> + and γδ+ t cells, as well as in tissues containing monocytes and macrophages, suggests that bovine cd163a may play a role in the regulation of the γδ+ t cell immune response, either through activation of transmembrane cd163a or proteolytic cleavage and release of soluble cd163a.

the characterization of the extracellular srcr structure of wc <dig> and cd <dig> family members may help to isolate their ligands, which in turn would help us to better understand their role in the γδ t cell response. the role of wc <dig> and the proposed role for cd163c-α are consistent with other group b srcr family transmembrane receptors expressed on t cells, such as cd <dig> and cd <dig>  cd <dig> binds to the protein alcam/cd <dig>  <cit> . cd <dig> has been shown to bind to various proteins, including cd <dig>  a 40- <dig> kda glycoprotein expressed on murine b splenocytes and activated t cells, a human  <dig> kda glycoprotein expressed on peripheral blood monocytes, certain igvh framework sequences and a bovine  <dig> kda protein expressed on activated b cells  <cit> . ligation of cd <dig> or cd <dig> affects responses through the t cell receptor and b cell signaling and lymphocyte activation  <cit> . it is known that srcr molecules also bind to molecules other than proteins; for example, the group b srcr molecules spα, cd <dig>  dmbt <dig> and cd163a bind to bacteria and spα and cd <dig> specifically bind to the bacterial products lipoteichoic acid  and lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . the srcr domains in wc <dig> or bovine cd163c-α do not have the bacteria-binding motif found in multiple srcr domains of dmbt <dig>  <cit> . however, the requirement for expression of specific wc <dig> receptors for the γδ t cell response to the bacteria leptospira  suggests that wc1/cd163c-α could recognize pathogen-associated molecules or a protein whose expression is induced by exposure to leptospira. although the ligands for wc <dig> and cd163c-α are unknown, domains  <dig>  and  <dig>  of bovine wc <dig> interact with an unknown molecule on the surface of macrophages or dendritic cells  <cit> . in contrast, another cd <dig> family member, cd163a, is known to bind haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes and tweak through its third srcr domain  and to bacteria or a molecule on erythroblasts via its second srcr domain   <cit> . neither of these domains occurs in either wc <dig> or cd163c-α, suggesting that cd163c-α ligation could be mediated by its unique domains "m", "l", or "n", and that it does not bind to haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes. since most of the diversity of bovine wc <dig> is found in domain "a", it is a reasonable candidate for the ligand-binding domain of the wc <dig> multi-gene family, which confers diversity on the γδ t cell response to pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
we have annotated the genes encoding cd163c-α and cd163a in cattle and shown that bovine cd163a is expressed in tissues containing monocytes and macrophages, as well as in sorted γδ t cells. the expression of bovine cd163c-α is enriched in wc1+ γδ t cells and it shares the conserved tyrosine motif necessary for wc <dig> signalling in t cells, implying that it functions similarly to wc <dig> in acting as a co-receptor for the γδ tcr. we have characterized cd163c-α and wc1/cd163c-α gene products in multiple species, correcting the incorrect assignment of many of them as cd163a gene products. the expansion of wc <dig>  cd163c-α and wc1/cd163c-α genes is correlated with a high level of γδ t cells in the peripheral blood of species separated by approximately  <dig> million years of evolution, suggesting that a diverse array of these molecules conveys a selective advantage to the γδ t cell response. future studies will address the significant questions of both the signalling potential of cd163c-α and cd163a in γδ t cells and the identification of ligands for cd163c-α/wc <dig> molecules.
