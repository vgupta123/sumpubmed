BACKGROUND
transcription of genes is generally controlled by a regulatory region of dna located mostly up-stream of the gene transcription start site. this regulatory region contains a short sequence that the regulatory proteins bind to in order to enhance/inhibit the gene expression  <cit> . current advance in high-throughput technologies such as dna microarrays, together with the availability of whole genome sequence for several species, enable us to study the genome-wide genetic regulatory networks. these heterogeneous functional genomic datasets have been used to acquire, catalogue and infer genetic regulatory networks in a "top-down" fashion. it focuses on the reverse-engineering of genetic networks by identifying the regulatory interactions, inferring the transcriptional modules and predicting the combinatorial regulation of transcriptional factors   <cit> . on the contrary, another principal research method, namely the "bottom-up" approach, builds detailed mathematical models for small-scaled genetic regulatory networks based on extensive experimental observations. to accomplish that goal, various types of models have been proposed to describe the genetic regulation. these models include, for example, differential equation models with continuous-time and continuous-variables, bayesian network models with discrete-time and continuous-variables and boolean network models with discrete-time and discrete-variables. particularly, many differential equation models  have been used to investigate the dynamic properties of genetic regulation  <cit> .

one of the major challenges of using a "bottom-up" approach to infer genetic regulation from microarray datasets is the lack of information for protein concentrations and activities. most of the previous researches were based on the assumption that the expression levels of a gene are consistent with its protein activities, though we know that is not always the case. an earlier practice to rectify above assumption is a hidden variable dynamic modelling  method, which is a linear dynamic model designed to estimate the activities of a tf by using the expression activities of its target genes  <cit> . later, the hvdm method was extended to a nonlinear one by using the michaelis-menten function  <cit> . in addition, mathematical models with time delay were also used to elucidate the time difference between the activities of tfs and the expression profiles of target genes  <cit> . nevertheless, a more sophisticated inference method, which considers both the time delay and protein-dna binding structure, is needed to accurately describe the genetic regulation in a "bottom-up" fashion. the development of such methods still remains as one of the major challenges in the computational study of genetic regulatory networks by the integration of "omics" datasets and experimental results  <cit> .

in earlier works, several "bottom-up" researches used the "master" gene networks to validate their proposed inference methodologies, as well as to investigate the regulatory function of the "master" gene  <cit> . among them, tumour suppressor gene p <dig> has been described as "the guardian of the genome" highlighting its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. since a point mutation within the p <dig> gene occurs in over half of all human tumours, an elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of p <dig> gene will contribute tremendously to the development of strategies for treating cancer  <cit> . although many experimental methods have been employed to identify the transcriptional target genes of p <dig> , it is imperative to develop more sophisticated mathematical models that precisely describe the p <dig> regulation. in this work, we propose a nonlinear differential equation model, which considers both the protein-dna binding structure and the effect of time delay, to infer genetic regulation from microarray gene expression datasets. the proposed method is then applied to predict the p <dig> target genes.

RESULTS
microarray data analysis
preprocessing of raw microarray data
by using a previously published dataset  <cit> , we selected  <dig>  probes  from the preprocessed microarray dataset  by using the pair-wise fisher's linear discriminant method  <cit> . to assess the robustness of such selection, we compared the gene selections between the pair-wise fisher's linear discriminant method and the masigpro method  <cit> . the masigpro method is an r package especially designed for analyzing time-course microarray experiments, which was applied to the same preprocessed microarray dataset. the parameter settings of the masigpro method are a false discovery value  that equals to  <dig>  and an r-squared threshold  whose value ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . table  <dig> suggests that both methods converged when a higher r-squared threshold  is used. particularly, with a higher r-squared threshold, genes provided by the masigpro method overlap more  with that selected by the fisher's method. thus, the defined top 15% of the most relevant response probes is considered to be a robust selection.

clustering analysis
consequently, the selected  <dig>  probes were assigned to  <dig> co-expressed gene modules by using a published computational approach  <cit>  that combines the stress function, neuron gas algorithm and k-nearest neighbour method. each gene module represents a set of co-expressed genes that are stimulated by either a specific experimental condition or a common trans-regulatory input. from a functional analysis of the  <dig> gene modules, we found that the co-expressed gene modules might contain genes with either heterogeneous or homogeneous biological functions, which are irrelevant to the number of genes in each module. rather, it may reflect the complex mechanisms that control the transcription regulation. therefore, in the subsequent analysis, we applied our nonlinear dynamic model on the profile of each individual gene instead of the mean centre of each gene module. detailed information of  <dig>  probes and the corresponding  <dig> co-expressed gene modules are available in .

validation of mathematical model
predicting protein activity from microarray gene expression profiles
based on the p <dig> protein-dna binding structure, we developed a nonlinear dynamic model  with a hill function to represent the expression process of p <dig> target genes. the hill coefficient was chosen to be  <dig> because p <dig> is in the form of tetramer as a transcription factor  <cit> . in addition, the proposed nonlinear model enables us to infer target genes that are negatively regulated by p <dig>  in an earlier work, a linear model provided good estimation of p <dig> activities by using five known p <dig> target genes  <cit> . to evaluate the performance of our nonlinear model, we used the same p <dig> targets  to predict the activities of p <dig>  here the time delay was assumed to be zero due to performing a consistent comparison study between the two models. ten sets of unknown model parameters together with the p <dig> activities at  <dig> time points were estimated from each replicate of the  <dig> microarray experiments and also from the average of these  <dig> microarray time courses. figure 1a presents the mean and 95% confidence interval of the  <dig> sets of the predicted p <dig> activities from  <dig> microarray experiments, and figure 1b shows the results of the  <dig> predictions from the averaged time courses of  <dig> microarray experiments. the relative error of the estimate in figure 1b is  <dig> , which is slightly larger than both that in figure 1a  and that obtained by the linear model . from figure  <dig>  we found that the new nonlinear model achieves the same goal as the linear model for predicting p <dig> activities.

accessing the predicted protein activity from various training genes
to determine the influence of training genes on the estimation of p <dig> activities, we selected various sets of  <dig> training genes to infer the p <dig> activities. although the obtained p <dig> activities in one test are similar to those presented in figure  <dig>  in which  <dig> training genes  <cit>  are negatively regulated by p <dig>  there is slight difference between the estimated p <dig> activities by using different sets of training genes. one of the tests is shown in figure  <dig>  where the estimated p <dig> activities were based on  <dig> training genes  that are negatively regulated by p <dig>  <cit> . similar to the study presented in figure  <dig>  ten sets of the p <dig> activities were estimated from each replicate of the  <dig> microarray experiments and also from the average of these  <dig> microarray time courses. the mean and 95% confidence interval of both estimates are presented in figures 2a and 2b, respectively. the relative error of the estimate in figure 2b is  <dig> , which is very close to that in figure 2a  but smaller than that obtained by the linear model  in figure  <dig>  in this case, the estimated p <dig> activities are very close to the measured ones. it suggests that our proposed nonlinear model is capable of making reliable predictions for the tf activities from the training genes that are all either positively or negatively regulated by the tf p <dig>  though the dependence between the training genes and predicted tfs activities may exist.

sensitivity analysis of model parameters
for the proposed nonlinear model , we also tested the variation of system dynamics by changing one of the four reaction rates . in this test, we used the predicted p <dig> activities and the corresponding model parameters to simulate the expression levels of gene ddb <dig> in figure 3a. by tuning one of the four parameters , we measured the ratio of simulation errors, defined by   

where x is the microarray expression level at t =  <dig>  x <dig> is the simulated expression level from the estimated model parameter, and  is the simulated expression level from the perturbed model parameter. figure 3a indicates that an increasing of the basal expression rate ci and a decreasing of the degradation rate di will cause considerable changes in the simulations  in addition, modification of maximal expression rate ki induces similar changes in the simulation; and a decreasing in parameter ki causes an error ratio  <dig> . furthermore, we used the khalil method  <cit>  to investigate the influence of parameter variations on the system dynamics at the other time points. simulations in figure 3b represent the variation of system dynamics induced by a unit perturbation of model parameter, which is similar to the defined ratio . the results of the sensitivity analysis in figure 3b are consistent with those in figure 3a. therefore, a variation of any parameter in the proposed nonlinear model may have considerable influence on the system dynamics.

prediction of p <dig> target genes
effect of time delay in p <dig> target gene prediction
in order to make a new prediction rather than reproduce the published results, we used the newly inferred p <dig> activity in figure 2b and the nonlinear model  to study the genetic regulation of p <dig> target genes. in the new model, the maximal possible time delay was set to  <dig>  hours because the experimentally determined time delay for p <dig> target genes is up to  <dig> hours  <cit> . we used the genetic algorithm to infer the p <dig> mediated genetic regulation . in different implementations of the genetic algorithm, the additionally unknown parameter of time delay may cause the estimates to vary across a wide range of values. to reduce such parameter variation, we used a natural spline interpolation to expand the measurements from the original  <dig> time points to  <dig> time points, by adding three equidistant measurement points between each pair of measured time points. in addition, we estimated the genetic regulation twice for each gene , and selected a final regulation result which has the smallest model estimation error.

comparison of predicted regulation states of p <dig> target genes across three different methods
subsequently, both the event method  <cit>  and correlation approach  <cit>  were used to infer the activation/inhibition of the p <dig> regulation. by comparing the consistency of inferred regulation relationships among the three methods , we found that  <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig>  probes from the estimation of the nonlinear model overlap with the results by the correlation method and event method, respectively. however, only  <dig> genes have the same p <dig> regulation state across all three methods. for the top  <dig> probes  that with smaller model estimation errors, the number of overlapping probes among the three methods is reduced to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. if we reduced the probe number further by considering the top  <dig> genes  only, then the overlapping number is reduced to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. thus, by reducing the probe number from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the proportions of gene numbers with the same predicted p <dig> regulation was increased . however, by reducing the probe number further to  <dig>  we did not find such change. therefore, in subsequent data analysis, we only focused on the top  <dig>  predicted genes. among these putative p <dig> target genes, ~64% are positively regulated by p <dig> while the rest are negatively regulated. a go functional study of these  <dig> putative p <dig> target genes indicates that ~16% of them have unknown functions and these genes are excluded from our further study.

binding motif information of predicted p <dig> target genes
to provide more criteria for identifying putative p <dig> target genes, we searched for the p <dig> binding motif on the upstream non-coding region of the top  <dig> genes. this is because a physical interaction between p <dig> and its targets is essential for its role as a controller of the genetic regulation  <cit> . particularly, p <dig> has a well documented  <dig> bp consensus binding motif  and a dna sequence with two copies of such monomer is strongly bound by the p <dig> protein  <cit> . thus, for each putative target, we extracted the corresponding  <dig> kb dna sequences located directly upstream of the transcription start site from refs  <cit> . among the  <dig> putative p <dig> target genes, we found the upstream dna sequences for  <dig> of them. then a motif discovery program matrixreduce  <cit>  was applied to search for the p <dig> consensus binding site. the results indicate that ~ <dig> %  of putative p <dig> targets have at least  <dig> copies of the p <dig> binding motif , while only ~10%  and ~20%  of them have zero and one p <dig> monomer, respectively. based on the model estimation error and upstream tf-binding information of the  <dig> putative p <dig> target genes, we further narrowed down the number of possible p <dig> targets. in addition, for any gene that has more than one probe, we chose only the probe that has the smallest estimation error. we also excluded genes with very small parameter ki in model  because p <dig> may not have much influence on them  <cit> . a final list containing ~ <dig> putative p <dig> targets  covers around ~24% of the total studied probes . table  <dig> presents  <dig> of these predicted putative p <dig> target genes.

the first  <dig> genes have minimal model error and the other  <dig> genes are known p <dig> target genes. 

discrepancies between different predictions
it is interesting to explore whether the putative p <dig> target genes identified above correspond to sets that have been discovered by other methods. for that reason, we collected four lists of putative p <dig> targets from different studies. they are  <dig> unique genes from  <dig> predicted p <dig> target probes which were obtained by applying the linear hvdm method on the affymetrix microarray time-series data  <cit> ;  <dig> unique genes which were detected by applying our non-linear dynamic model on the above same dataset;  <dig> unique genes which were identified by analysing p53-regulated gene expression profiles of oligonucleotide arrays  <cit> ; and  <dig> unique genes which were suggested by chip-pet analysis of human genome-wide p <dig> transcription-factor binding sites  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the overlapping among the different predictions is quite poor.

target gene bias from microarray datasets
to find out the reason for these discrepancies, we examined the  <dig> target genes that were identified in reference  <cit> . among these  <dig> target genes,  <dig> of them were firstly removed in our pre-processing step due to the weak signals, bad quality or less variation across all time points. secondly, another  <dig> of them were removed in the later selection of the most relevant response probes by using the fisher's linear discriminant method because of their weak response to the ionizing radiation. in the end, only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were entered into our nonlinear model and we finally identified  <dig> of them as our putative p <dig> target genes . the remaining  <dig> genes such as hsd17b <dig> were not included in our prediction because of the relatively large model estimation errors. the large errors may be a by-product of the noise in the microarray gene expression data.

target gene bias from inference models
we also investigated the  <dig> putative target genes that were provided by the linear model  <cit> . first of all,  <dig> of them were included in the top 15% of the most relevant response probes . secondly,  <dig> of them were within the top 50% of the  <dig>  probes and we removed  <dig> genes due to the relatively larger model estimation errors. finally, we further discarded probes with duplicate gene names  and genes without p <dig> binding site on the regulatory region . therefore in the final list in , we presented only  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> genes. figure  <dig> shows both the predicted and measured expression profiles of  <dig> genes which were selected in reference  <cit> . taken together, we conclude that the discrepancy of p <dig> target gene predictions among various studies may be mainly caused by either pre-processing of microarray data or condition-specific gene regulation.

in silico validation of putative p <dig> targets
although a wet lab experiment may be the best way to validate the whole list of predictions, other external information such as dna sequence analysis could be used to support the computational predictions  <cit> . for example, we found ~80% of the top  <dig> putative p <dig> targets have at least  <dig> perfect matches of p <dig> consensus sequences  on the  <dig> kb upstream region. this may support the hypothesis that the predicted target genes may be strongly bound by p <dig> in vivo  <cit> . a short list of these p <dig> target genes is shown in table  <dig>  where we found many known p <dig> target genes including p <dig>  bax, bik and mdm <dig>  however, a number of the top ranked putative target genes, such as the  <dig> genes  that encode ribosomal proteins and several major histocompatibility complex genes , seem to have no obvious connection to p <dig>  these ribosomal proteins have been shown to activate p <dig> by inhibiting oncoprotein mdm <dig>  leading to inhibition of cell cycle progression  <cit> . thus, the ribosomal proteins can regulate the p53-mdm <dig> feedback loop in response to different stresses and provide a general pathway for p <dig> activation from perturbation of ribosome biogenesis. for major histocompatibility complex genes, they are involved in the major histocompatibility complex  class i antigen presentation pathway which plays a key role in host tumour surveillance. experimental data suggest that p <dig> activates the mhc class i pathway by inducing tap <dig>  which would assist the process  <cit> .

protein binding motif analysis for putative p <dig> target genes
binding site distribution of putative p <dig> target genes
the lack of common p <dig> targets among four different predictions generated a few interesting questions to us. will the four lists of putative p <dig> targets share the same p <dig> binding motif distribution on the upstream non-coding region? will the genes predicted from these four studies share the same functional categories too? to answer these questions, we collected the p <dig> binding motif counts on the gene upstream regions for the four predictions and listed the results in table  <dig>  it indicates that putative targets predicted by the gene expression analysis, the chip-pet analysis, and our nonlinear model, share a similar p <dig> binding preference. for example, there is an even distribution  of zero, one, two, and more than two p <dig> binding sites on the  <dig> kb region. however, there are more p <dig> binding motifs on the  <dig> kb upstream region than those on the  <dig> kb region. in addition, ~46-58% of putative p <dig> targets have more than two p <dig> binding sites on the  <dig> kb upstream region but only ~16-20% of targets have multiple binding sites on the  <dig> kb region. furthermore, less than 10% of targets do not have p <dig> binding sites on the  <dig> kb region. the similar binding preference among various predictions suggests that the majority of putative p <dig> targets  may be directly controlled by remote p <dig> transcription factors but less than 30% of them may be the second effect targets.

functional analysis of putative p <dig> target genes
a functional analysis of above four lists of putative p <dig> targets also reveals interesting information such as the fact that all works identified the same core biological functions of p <dig> . however, there are a few gene functional categories that were only predicted by individual studies. for example, the lists from the gene expression analysis and chip-pet analysis contain blood coagulation, body fluids, response to wound, muscle and signal transduction genes. however, only the list from the chip-pet analysis is enriched by cell motility, cell localization and enzyme activity genes. in addition, high enrichment of metabolism, biosynthetic process and immune system process exclusively appear in our prediction. although our results indicate that most of the p <dig> targets share the same p <dig> binding preference, their functional roles are conditionally specific and their biological functions span to various functional categories with the dependence of intrinsic and extrinsic conditions. the functional differences among the four lists of putative p <dig> targets may partially explain the reason for the poor overlapping among them. in addition, the poor overlapping may be caused by the putative p <dig> target genes that were induced by different types of event such as different cell types or different treatments of p <dig> regulation. for example, the target genes identified by microarray time-series data  <cit>  was under γ-irradiated human molt <dig> cells; but the target genes predicted from oligonucleotide arrays  <cit>  and chip-pet analysis  <cit>  were induced by zinc-induced p <dig> in eb- <dig> cells and 5-fluorouracil treated hct <dig> cells, respectively. thus, the results suggest that the nature of p <dig> response is conditionally dependent. different experiments form distinct sets of putative target genes and a subset with a few target genes in common to all p <dig> responses  <cit> .

combinational regulation of putative p <dig> target genes
furthermore, we looked for the potential p <dig> co-regulators on the upstream non-coding region of the putative p <dig> target genes. by collecting  <dig> weight matrixes of human transcription-factors, which represent  <dig> unique human tfs from the transfac database  <cit> , and transforming the weight matrices to the position-specific affinity matrices, we used the matrixreduce program  <cit>  to compute the transcription factor binding affnities on the upstream of all putative p <dig> targets . a clustering analysis of the relative sequence affinity profiles for human tfs was also performed , which suggests the predicted sequence signals of several human tfs are either commonly enriched or depleted in all targets related to the expected occurrence on random sequences. for instance, the top two most depleted sequence signals are e2f and creb, which rarely appear on the  <dig> k upstream region of all putative p <dig> target genes. it suggests that these two tfs may not directly interact with p <dig> target genes. such hypothesis is consistent with the literature information, which claims that both e2f and creb often interact with other proteins directly and form a protein complex to regulate the transcriptional activity . on the other hand, the top three most enriched sequence affnities on  <dig> kb upstream region for putative p <dig> targets are pitx <dig>  foxo <dig> and tbp, which are all known to be related to functional regulation of p <dig>  pitx <dig> can bind to hpv e <dig> protein and inhibit e6/e6ap-mediated p <dig> degradation  <cit> . foxo <dig> may function as a tumour suppressor and regulators of foxo <dig> function are controlled by p <dig>  <cit> . tbp is a tata-binding protein but p <dig> can prevent tbp from participating in rna pol iii-dependent transcription  <cit> . thus, p <dig> response genes may preserve certain sequence specific features  that enables p <dig> to interact easily with other co-regulators to control diverse biological processes.

discussion
this work developed a nonlinear model for inferring genetic regulation from microarray gene expression data. the major feature of this approach is the inclusion of the cooperative binding of tfs by which we can study the nonlinear properties of gene expression in a sophisticated way. it is also a practical approach to investigate the impact of time delay of gene expression on the dynamics of the down-stream target genes. we validated the proposed method by comparing the estimated tf p <dig> activities with experimental data. in addition, the predicted putative p <dig> target genes by our nonlinear model were supported by dna sequence analysis which suggests that p <dig> predominately controls remote genes. the long-distance gene regulation may be accomplished by a cooperative regulation between p <dig> and other proteins. this hypothesis may also explain the poor overlap among the four lists of the putative p <dig> target genes, and support the fact that we could not find a p <dig> binding motif on the upstream non-coding region of at least 20% of the putative p <dig> targets although these genes may be strongly positively regulated by p <dig> protein  <cit> .

for issues regarding the estimation of protein activities and the effects of time delay in genetic regulation, we first emphasize that gene transcription depends on multiple factors such as the activities of transcription factors, the availability of rna polymerase and the activities of other promoters in the transcriptional machinery. for example, in order to activate gene expression, the required availability of rnap ii and other promoters differ significantly between two p <dig> target genes - p <dig> and fas/aop <dig>  <cit> . however, most modelling approaches including our current study approximate the activities of all the promoters in the transcriptional machinery as the activities of tf p <dig>  therefore, our estimated p <dig> activities represent the total activities of all factors in the transcriptional machinery, which may be slightly different from one another if various sets of training target genes were used. in addition, time delay exists in many biological processes of gene expression such as transcriptional initiation, elongation, protein translocation, and translational elongation. however, in the present model, we simplified all kinds of time delay effects into a single factor. this is a practical approach to study the time delay effect of each individual p <dig> target gene, and therefore the time delay of each gene may differ.

finally, a number of factors may contribute to the variation of predictions using the mathematical model. for example, we have shown that the selection of training genes may influence the estimation of p <dig> activity and consequently alter the prediction of putative target genes. in addition, the proposed nonlinear differential equation model may affect the estimation of putative target genes. the present model estimation error is related to the selection of synthesis function. although the michaelis-menten function is generally used if there is no extra information about the tfs, more precise estimates may be obtained by using a more sophisticated synthesis function which requires tfs' cooperative binding and/or binding sites information. furthermore, in the present work the relative error was used to compare the errors of different genes. nevertheless, the model estimation error may be large if the gene expression is weak. for that reason, a number of discovered p <dig> target genes were not included in our prediction, even though their simulations matched well the gene expression profiles . thus, it is worthy to evaluate the influence of the error measurement on both the predictions of the tf activities and genetic regulation to the putative target genes. in that case, other error measurement methods  may be considered. finally, it is widely recognized that microarray gene expression data is noisy. it is therefore important to develop stochastic models and the corresponding stochastic inference methods  <cit>  to investigate the impact of gene expression noise on the accuracy of the modelling inference.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have developed a nonlinear model for inferring genetic regulation from microarray gene expression data. this "bottom-up" method was designed not only to infer the regulation relationship between tf and its down-stream genes but also to estimate the up-stream protein activities based on the expression levels of the target genes. the successful prediction of a large number of putative p <dig> target genes indicates that the proposed dynamic model is a promising method to investigate genetic regulation. it is expected that our results will provide both valuable prediction for further experimental validation and quantitative information for the development of the p <dig> gene regulatory networks.
