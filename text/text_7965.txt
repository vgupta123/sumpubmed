BACKGROUND
systemic lupus erythematosus  is characterized by spontaneous production of autoantibodies including anti-nuclear autoantibodies , and by development of vasculitis and autoimmune glomerulonephritis  preferentially in females. the genetic susceptibility loci have been mapped throughout the chromosomes, the major locus having been mapped to the chromosome  <dig> telomeric region, in which many immunoregulatory genes are concentrated in humans as well as in mice  <cit> . one of the major susceptible haplotypes in this region has been identified in murine sle models as the group of seven genes for the signal lymphocyte activation molecule  family members, which regulate cognate interactions between t and b cells, and signaling  <cit> . interestingly, while both slam haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> in non-autoimmune strains of mice, such as c57bl/ <dig>  and 129/svj, respectively, are not harmful when expressed in the original genetic backgrounds of the host strains, slam haplotype  <dig> in  <dig> mice  renders the hosts susceptible to autoimmunity, anas being produced when expressed in the b <dig> genetic background  <cit> . interestingly, four members of the slam family cluster, cd <dig>  ly <dig>  cd <dig>  and cs <dig>  vary in their expression in splenic b and/or t cells between b <dig> mice harboring haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in particular, ly <dig> was suggested to be one of the determinants of the autoimmunity susceptibility  <cit> .

another important susceptible gene for autoimmunity in this 1q telomeric region has been suggested to be the gene coding for a unique inhibitory fc receptor for igg , fcγriib   <cit> . generally, it is well established that the fcγr family molecules expressed on myeloid-lineage cells and b cells play crucial roles in adaptive immune responses and inflammation, in which activating-type fcγrs such as fcγriii initiate and accelerate the responses, while inhibitory riib decreases them upon co-engagement with other activating-type fcγrs or b cell antigen receptors via igg immune complexes   <cit> . thus, riib executes important igg-mediated feedback regulation of cell activation, proliferation and antibody/cytokine production, as demonstrated in different experimental settings using riib-deficient  mice  <cit> . in contrast to this well-established feedback regulation, the roles of riib in maintaining tolerance and in preventing spontaneous development of autoimmunity, however, remain uncertain due to the inconsistent phenotypes observed in riib−/− mice by different research groups, particularly in terms of the level of anas and the severity of lupus nephritis  <cit> . in addition, a recent report  <cit>  pointed out the role of riib expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in the clearance of small size igg-ics, so the additional riib function of minimizing the level of pathologic igg-ics in the blood should also be taken into account.

importantly, the fcr locus is adjacent to the slam locus in the 1q telomere of the mouse genome  <cit> . it has been pointed out that special care should be taken when examining the precise influence of any targeted gene, such as that of riib, located in this region on the occurrence of spontaneous autoantibody production and of lupus nephritis, by eliminating any influence of slam members in gene-targeted mice generated with 129-derived es cells and backcrossed into the genetic background of b <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the differences in the observed phenotypes in riib−/− mice could be due, at least in part, to the heterogeneity of the genomic interval around the riib−/− locus in the b <dig> background, which might be co-segregated with the autoimmune-prone slam <dig> haplotype discussed above  <cit> . in addition to the genetic heterogeneity of riib−/− mice, unidentified differences in environmental conditions such as those in nutrition and the gut microbial flora should also be considered.

to clarify the role of riib in peripheral tolerance in the absence of any effect of the pathogenic slam <dig> haplotype, we separated the riib−/− locus and the slam <dig> locus by extensively backcrossing our riib−/− mice into the b <dig> background, followed by analysis of microsatellite markers in this genetic interval in the offspring. each of the two congenic b <dig> strains obtained, one harboring riib−/− and the other pathogenic slam <dig>  exhibited unique phenotypes as to germinal center formation in the spleen, anas in serum, igg-ic deposition in the kidneys, and development of lupus nephritis, which revealed the exact roles of riib and slam129-derived set of molecules in maintaining tolerance, which were examined in detail in this study.

methods
mice
the original fcγriib -deficient mice constructed with a  <dig> and b <dig> hybrid background  <cit>  were backcrossed into the b <dig> background for  <dig> generations as described previously  <cit>  using c57bl/6ncrj mice , and then, in this study, they were further backcrossed up to the 28th generation . the offspring were genotyped by analysis of simple sequence length polymorphisms  using the seventeen sslp markers on chromosome  <dig>  which allow discrimination of the polymorphisms in b <dig> and  <dig> mice, particularly around the fcgr2b gene and for the slam haplotype . sslp analysis was conducted by the central institute of experimental animals . we established two substrains, n <dig> and n <dig> b <dig> riib−/−slamb <dig>  and b <dig> riib+/+slam <dig>  mice as well as n <dig> b <dig> riib−/−slam <dig>  mice as controls . riib-deficient mice were also provided by s. hirose of juntendo univ. , or purchased from taconic® farms . when pertinent, we refer to our n <dig> riib−/− mice used in the present study as riib−/−sendai and those obtained or purchased from others as riib−/−tokyo or riib−/−taconic, respectively, in order to distinguish the data in figures. in several experiments, we also employed b <dig> mice obtained from clea japan, inc.  as aged controls or a 12-month-old nzb/w f <dig> female mouse from japan slc, inc.  as an autoimmune control. for adaptation, the b <dig> mice of non-littermate controls and nzb/w f <dig>  riib−/−tokyo, and riib−/−taconic mice were housed in our facility for at least 6 months before use. all mice were housed in the experimental animal facility of the institute of development, aging and cancer , an environmentally controlled and specific pathogen-free facility. all animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the animal studies committee of the tohoku university, and we followed the guidelines defined by the committee.

genotyping of snps
for isolation of genomic dna samples, tail tips from mice were lysed by incubation in 100 μl of tail lysis buffer  for at least 4 hours at 55°c. tail lysates were diluted with  <dig> volumes of water, and then subjected to pcr amplification using gene-specific pcr primer pairs  and kod fx polymerase  as follows: initial 2-min incubation at 94°c, 30 cycles consisting of 95°c for 30 s, 60°c for 30 s and 72°c for 90 s, and a final 10 min elongation step at 72°c. for determination of snps in the vicinity of the fcgr2b locus, pcr products were directly sequenced using specific primers  with a 3130x <dig> sequencer .

antibodies
for facs analysis, the following fluorochrome-labeled antibodies specific for mouse molecules were used: cd4-fitc, cd4-alexa <dig>  cd19-pacific blue , and gl7-fitc and fas-pe . for immunohistochemistry, anti-mouse-igm-alexa <dig>  anti-rat-igg-alexa <dig>  and anti-mouse-igg-alexa <dig> , anti-mouse-igd-biotin , gl7-alexa <dig> , and anti-mouse igm f <dig> alexa <dig>  were used.

histological study and immunohistochemistry
kidneys were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 2 μm, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin  or periodic acid-schiff . to evaluate glomerular lesions, at least  <dig> glomeruli were examined per he-stained section by light microscopy based on pathological manifestations of inflammation, and/or tissue damage in a blind manner  <cit> . the severity of glomerulonephritis was estimated as follows; grade  <dig>  normal; grade  <dig>  neutrophil infiltration and segmental mesangial proliferation; grade  <dig>  limited lobulated glomeruli in grade 1; and grade  <dig>  crescent formation and severe lobulated glomeruli with lymphocyte infiltration . to assay igg-ics deposition, kidney samples were embedded in o.c.t. compound , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then sectioned at 5 μm. the sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed again three times with pbs, and then preincubated for 1 hour at room temperature with pbs containing 20% bsa to block nonspecific antibody binding. they were then incubated overnight at room temperature with affinity-purified alexa488-conjugated goat f <dig> fragments  anti-mouse igg . after washing three times with pbs, slides were mounted and examined under an olympus bx <dig> microscope equipped with an olympus bh2-rfl-t <dig> mercury lamp and appropriate optics.

spleens were embedded in o.c.t. compound, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then sectioned at 8 μm. sections were fixed with acetone for 20 min at −20°c and then air-dried for 1 hour. after washing with pbs six times, sections were pre-incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with pbs containing 2% bsa for blocking, and then incubated with alexa488-labeled anti-mouse igm  or alexa488-labeled gl <dig>  and biotinylated anti-mouse igd  for staining of splenic b cells. after washing with pbs three times, sections were incubated with 1: <dig> diluted alexa546-conjugated streptavidin at 4°c for 30 min.

determination of ana levels in sera from indirect immunofluorescence and by hep <dig> cell staining combined with elisa
for determination of gross ana levels, serum samples from 24–48-wk-old mice were serially diluted from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> with pbs containing 1% bsa. hep- <dig> cell-seeded slides  were incubated with diluted serum samples for 45 min at room temperature, followed by brief washing and incubation with pbs for 60 min. anti-nuclear antibodies  were detected with alexa488-labeled anti-mouse igg f <dig>  and visualized under a fluorescence microscope . to determine ana levels and the igg isotypes by elisa, sera from mice were diluted 1: <dig> with pbs containing 1% bsa and then added to a hep- <dig> coated 96-well plate . ana and the igg isotypes were detected with hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg fc fragment and anti-mouse igg itsotype-specific antibodies , respectively.

elisa measurement of igs and anti-dna antibodies
the serum levels of total igm, igg, and autoantibodies were measured by elisa. for anti-ssdna and -dsdna antibodies, high-bound flat-bottom 96-well plates were coated firstly with  <dig> % protamine sulfate in water for 60 min, and then with 5 μg/ml of single-strand or double-strand calf thymus dna  diluted in  <dig>  m sodium citrate containing  <dig>  m nacl for 90 min, followed by blocking with 50% fcs in pbs for 60 min. serum samples were diluted to 1: <dig> with pbs containing 1% bsa and  <dig> % tween  <dig>  and then applied to the dna-coated 96-well plates. serum from a 12-month-old nzb/w f <dig> female mouse was used as a control. after washing three times with pbs containing  <dig> % of tween  <dig>  anas were detected with anti-mouse igg conjugated with hrp as detection antibodies. the total igm and igg levels were measured with a mouse igm elisa quantitation set and a mouse igg elisa quantitation set , respectively, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. to titrate anti-dna antibodies, a positive control serum from an old female nzb/w f <dig> mouse was examined for the anti-dsdna and anti-ssdna levels using mouse monoclonal anti-dsdna igg2a , which is also cross-reactive with ssdna on elisa.

flow cytometry
spleens were isolated from b <dig> and riib−⁄− mice, and suspended as single cells with pbs containing 1% bsa. red blood cells were depleted by lysis with  <dig>  m nh4cl.  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per sample were blocked with 25 μg/ml anti-fcγrii/iii , incubated for 15 min at 4°c, and then stained with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies. all fluorescent antibodies were used at 1: <dig> dilution. data were collected with facscalibur and facsaria, and analyzed using cellquest and facsdiva software , respectively.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using microsoft excel for mac  <dig> software version  <dig> . <dig>  or prism <dig> software . data are displayed when appropriate as means ± sd. data were compared for statistical differences using student’s t test with two-tailed analysis, log-rank test, or chi-square test, as indicated in each figure legend. p values are shown in the relevant figures. p < <dig>  was considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS
riib−/−, slam <dig>  and riib−/−slam <dig> lines with the b <dig> background thrive normally
riib−/− and slam <dig> mice were generated by backcrossing our 12th-backcross  riib−/− mice  <cit>  into the b <dig> genetic background further to the 28th generation . analysis of a series of microsatellite markers including d1mit <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the vicinities of the fcgr2b and slam loci revealed the successful separation of the riib−/− locus and the slam <dig> locus during the backcross . we also obtained a mouse line with the combined loci, n <dig> riib−/−slam <dig>  as a control . both the n <dig> riib−/−  and n <dig> slam <dig> mice thrived normally, at least up to 45 weeks after birth, and the riib−/−slam <dig> mice did as well despite the fact that female riib−/−slam <dig> mice manifested obvious glomerulonephritis, as judged on histology , which was consistent with our previous observation for n <dig> riib−/− mice  <cit> . four  out of six  riib−/− mice obtained from a breeder  died before 45 weeks of age in our facility, due probably to lupus nephritis  <cit>  . mice obtained from another facility   <cit>  thrived like our riib−/− mice did. it should be stressed that our riib−/−sendai line and riib−/− animals from other sources were derived from a common origin  <cit> , and backcrossed into the b <dig> background at different facilities. these results indicate that, even under identical environmental conditions, fcγriib-deficient mice with 129-derived genetic intervals of different lengths around the riib−/− locus show different mortalities, raising the possibility of some influence of unidentified genetic factor within the intervals in the b <dig> genetic background. also, the separation of the riib−/− locus from that of autoimmune-prone slam <dig> as well as extensive shortening of the 129-derived interval  allowed the establishment of n <dig> riib−/−sendai mice with a normal survival rate, which we mainly used in our analysis described below.figure  <dig>

riib−/− mice produce a small amount of anas
to gain an insight into the difference between riib−/− and slam <dig> mice, and its relation to autoimmunity, we measured the total igm and igg levels in sera from these locus-separated lines and the combined line, riib−/−slam <dig>  as a control, at the age of 24– <dig> weeks. we found that the igm levels in riib−/−slam <dig> mice but not riib−/− or slam <dig> mice were higher than that in b <dig> mice, while the igg levels were higher in female riib−/− mice and riib−/−slam <dig> mice of both genders, but not slam <dig> mice, than that in b <dig> mice . regarding autoantibodies, both riib−/− and slam <dig> mice at 36 weeks of age produced a detectable level of anas, but in much smaller amounts than riib−/−slam <dig> mice did, as shown on immunofluorescent staining of hep- <dig> cells combined with elisa, and the levels were less than one-tenth to that in a 12-month-old nzb/w f <dig> positive control mouse . there was a tendency that the ana production and/or accumulation was more pronounced in female than male riib−/− mice , the female bias being more evident on the titration with hep-2-hepana test at 24 weeks of age . this gender bias was not clear in slam <dig> mice or a breeder’s riib−/− line . we also checked the igg subclass of anas by hep- <dig> elisa , and found that igg2c was the most prominently produced subclass of anas in riib−/− mice, suggesting that type  <dig> helper t cells are dominantly activated.figure  <dig>

examination of the staining profile of hep- <dig> cells  indicated that anas detected in sera from female riib−/− mice at 24 weeks of age comprised a mixture of anti-dna, histone and nucleolus antibodies, and others, because the staining could be classified into nucleolar, homogeneous, and other types, while for the anas at  <dig> and 36 weeks of age peripheral-type staining was dominant, indicating the anti-dsdna antibodies were major . when we compared the staining profiles in female riib−/− and slam <dig> mice at 24 weeks of age, we observed that the peripheral-type staining was dominant in slam <dig> mice , suggesting that the compositions of anas produced by riib−/− and slam <dig> mice at 24 weeks of age are qualitatively different, as determined based on the hep- <dig> cell staining profiles, albeit the assay used is not sufficiently quantitative.figure  <dig>

in addition to determination of the total ana levels described above, we also measured the anti-dna levels in sera from mice at different ages by elisa. anti-single-stranded dna and -double-stranded dna antibodies were detected, albeit in very small amounts, in riib−/− mice at around 12 weeks and 16– <dig> weeks of age, respectively, and the levels were higher in females than males after 28 weeks of age, while b <dig> female mice, as healthy controls, at the same ages did not significantly produce anti-dna antibodies as compared to those in a nzb/w f <dig> mouse as a disease control . as was the case for the serum ana levels, riib−/−slam <dig> mice produced anti-dna antibodies, particularly abundantly in females . the bias was not clear in a breeder’s riib−/− line . these results indicate that our riib−/− and slam <dig> mice differently produce and/or maintain anas including anti-dna autoantibodies.figure  <dig>

weak glomerulonephritis in riib−/− mice
given the production of anti-dna antibodies by riib−/− mice, we next examined the renal histology, and scored the glomerulonephritis in male and female riib−/−, slam <dig>  and riib−/−slam <dig> mice at 36 weeks of age . while control female riib−/−slam <dig> mice exhibited severe glomerulonephritis with occasional crescent formation, mesangial cell proliferation, macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and lobulation of glomeruli, female riib−/− mice exhibited weak but less severe glomerulonephritis than control riib−/−slam <dig> animals, with mesangial cell proliferation and neutrophil infiltration . male riib−/−, and male and female slam <dig> mice only showed occasional mesangial cell proliferation. we also examined igg-ic deposition in renal samples by immunofluorescence microscopy, and found that only female riib−/− and riib−/−slam <dig> mice exhibited weak deposition , but female slam <dig> mice did not . these results indicate that the development of glomerulonephritis observed in riib−/− mice had occurred in a female-biased manner, while slam <dig> mice did not develop the disease at least until 36 weeks of age. it is noteworthy that the development of glomerulonephritis seemingly correlated with the female-biased ana increase in riib−/− and riib−/−slam <dig> animals described above , but slam <dig> mice did not manifest the disease regardless of the fact that they produced anas at comparable levels to female riib−/− mice, at least at 24 weeks of age . this notion suggests a contribution of fcγriib to protection from igg-ic deposition in glomeruli and glomerulonephritis.figure  <dig>

splenic germinal center formation was grossly normal in riib−/− mice
we were interested in determining why anas and anti-dna antibodies in sera were increased in riib−/− mice, albeit in very small amounts. to this end, we isolated spleens, and examined their weights, histology, and cellularity. while splenomegaly was observed in riib−/−slam <dig> mice, it was much less evident in riib−/− mice . this was, however, not pronounced in the total splenic lymphocytes of riib−/− animals . immunohistochemistry of spleen sections prepared from naïve mice indicated that germinal center  formation was grossly normal in riib−/− mice of both genders, while it was augmented in slam <dig> mice . the numbers of total gl7+fas+ gc cells and cd19+gl7+fas+ gc b cells were not significantly increased in riib−/− mice of both genders, while they tended to be increased in female riib−/−slam <dig> and slam <dig> animals , these observations being reminiscent of slam’s important role in adequate b–t cell communication in gcs  <cit> . thus, we failed to find marked alterations in riib−/− mice in terms of the total splenic lymphocyte and gc cell numbers other than slight splenomegaly. further analysis of other parameters such as plasma cells, antigen-presenting cells and t cells may help to clarify the reason for the production of a small amount of autoantibodies in riib−/− mice.figure  <dig>

discussion
the exact effect of riib deficiency on spontaneous development of autoimmune diseases is controversial. regarding animal models, riib gene-targeted mice derived from es cells of the  <dig> strain and backcrossed into the b <dig> genetic background yielded different phenotypes in different laboratories, most probably due to different contributions of the autoimmune-prone slam <dig> haplotype neighboring the riib locus  <cit> . in this study, we, for the first time, established two lines through extensive backcrossing, one line with riib deficiency but the non-autoimmune b <dig> slam haplotype, and the other with autoimmune-prone slam <dig> and the intact riib gene, both having the b <dig> background and being housed under identical environmental conditions. we found that the riib deficiency indeed caused a spontaneous increase of a very small amount of anas including anti-dna autoantibodies, and weak glomerulonephritis with slight igg-ic deposition in glomeruli in a female-biased manner, while the slam <dig> line exhibited ana production accompanying no obvious glomerulonephritis, igg-ic deposition being minimum and comparable to that in the b <dig> control.

riib is known to be an important suppressor of the production and/or accumulation of autoantibodies in some animal models, in which the diseases were induced experimentally in autoimmune-prone mouse strains or non-autoimmune b <dig> mice by immunization  <cit> . a recent report  <cit>  has pointed out the additional role of riib, expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, in the clearance of small size igg-ics, and potentially in minimizing the level of pathologic igg-ics in the blood. in contrast to well-established feedback immunoregulation, and its crucial role in suppressing autoantibody production and/or accumulation after active immunization of susceptible mice, the role of riib in physiological suppression of spontaneous autoantibody production in non-autoimmune strains remained unclear due to the inconsistent phenotypes of riib-deficient mice observed in different laboratories  <cit> , the mice being extremely prone to the production of anti-chromatin autoantibodies and susceptible to the development of fatal lupus  <cit> , whereas in others they were not susceptible to the development of lupus nephritis without massive production of autoantibodies  <cit> . to circumvent the difficulty in isolating the effect of riib deficiency by backcrossing, boross et al. generated b6- but not 129-origin riib-deficient mice by gene targeting in b6-derived es cells  <cit> . they observed that riib-deficient mice produced only a small amount of anti-ssdna antibodies spontaneously even at the age of 10 months, exhibited slight igg-ic deposition in the kidneys, and increases in urinary albumin and the pathological score of glomerulonephritis, without showing mortality at least up to 12 months of age, indicating that riib deficiency only amplifies spontaneous autoimmunity determined by other loci. these phenotypes are mostly the same as those of our riib−/− mice in this study in terms of the very low ana level and slight igg-ic deposition without development of glomerulonephritis. similar results have also been obtained for congenic lines within the nba <dig> autoimmune susceptibility locus  <cit> . thus, our present observations substantially support those reported for b6-based riib−/− mice  <cit> , and our results also indicate that riib prevents the spontaneous production and/or accumulation of a small amount of anas.

the igg-ic deposition, albeit slight, and the increase in the pathological score for glomerulonephritis in riib−/− mice were unexpected, because these phenotypes were not observed in the slam <dig> line housed under the same environmental conditions as riib−/− mice . these observations are also consistent with those for the b6-based riib-deficient mice  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study employing a cell type-specific riib deletion technique has shown that riib on myeloid cells and intrinsic renal cells rather than b cells prevents nephrotoxic nephritis, suggesting a significant role of riib on myeloid cells and renal mesangial cells in this protection  <cit> . it has also been shown that neither b cell- nor myeloid-specific deletion of riib leads to the development of crescentic glomerulonephritis with a higher incidence than in wild-type mice in an anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease model, indicating that riib deficiency in either b cells or a subset of myeloid cells alone is not sufficient to increase the susceptibility to the kidney disease  <cit> . in contrast to riib−/− mice, slam <dig> animals did not show igg-ic deposition in the kidneys, even though they had a comparable level of serum anas to that in riib−/− mice, at least at 24 weeks of age. thus, the slam <dig> haplotype in the b <dig> background does not contribute to the development of glomerulonephritis but to ana production, due to the lack of a significant role in the kidneys.

generally, development of autoimmune diseases is biased toward females in humans and in mice, the main reason for which being the various influence of sex hormones on the immune system and cells  <cit> . the reason for the gender bias in the ana levels in riib−⁄− mice rather than slam <dig> mice is currently unknown, although one may speculate that antigen-presenting cell–t cell communication could be more prone to be de-regulated in females than b cell–t cell interactions, which could be influenced by slam <dig>  further examinations will clarify the differences in gender in splenocytes and lymph node cells, and even in those in the lamina propria.

CONCLUSIONS
separation of the riib−/− locus from the autoimmune-prone slam <dig> locus revealed the role of riib in maintenance of peripheral tolerance. as judged on assessment under identical genetic and environmental conditions, riib deficiency caused slight ana production and/or its accumulation accompanied by non-lethal glomerulonephritis with a low level of igg-ic deposition, in contrast to the role of slam <dig>  which causes ana production without accompanying glomerulonephritis. the combination of the riib deficiency and slam <dig> synergistically induced substantial ana production and sub-lethal glomerulonephritis. these results will facilitate development of strategies for targeting riib for treating autoimmune disorders involving autoantibody production such as sle.
