BACKGROUND
hepatocellular carcinoma  is a highly aggressive epithelial tumor originating both from mature hepatocytes and stem cells  <cit> . it is characterized by poor prognosis and very high rate of recurrence. epidemiological studies indicate that hcc is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide  <cit> . major risk factors include hbv/hcv infection, alcohol/drug abuse, aflatoxin exposure and genetic defects such as primary hemochromatosis and wilson’s disease  <cit> . the use of animal models helped to better understand the different phases of the entire cancerous process. in this regard, animals’ treatment with diethylnitrosamine  is one of the most frequently used approaches  <cit> . diethylnitrosamine is a well-known hepatic carcinogen. at the cellular level, particularly inside the hepatocyte, it acts as an alkylating agent, producing lesions and dna mutations  <cit> . a study demonstrated that den administration for several weeks induces a rapid cancer development and promotes hcc formation in  <dig> % of male and 10– <dig> % of female mice  <cit> . literature reports indicate that tumor molecular profile of mice exposed to den are comparable to those related to human hcc cases characterized by a poor prognosis  <cit> . this is the reason why it is considered a typical approach for hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo studies. micrornas  are a class of small, non-coding rnas that generated a great impact in the molecular biology field. they can negatively regulate the expression of target genes in a post-transcriptional manner, inducing mrna degradation or inhibiting mrna translation  <cit> . after their discovery, mirnas received enormous attention because of their ability to regulate almost every aspect of cellular functions, such as differentiation, development, apoptosis and proliferation  <cit> . mirna deregulated activity has been described in various pathologies including cancer  <cit> . in order to make easier the identification of specific target genes, bioinformatics tools have been set-up. they provide the possibility to analyze a particular sequence located at the 5’ end of mirna, called “seed region”, in order to predict the most probable genes potentially interacting with it. although complementarity remains the main feature, the tools take into account other important characteristics such as site accessibility, sequence conservation, multiple binding sites  <cit> . bioinformatics tools have greatly improved methods for detection of mirna targets, due to their ability in quickly processing huge datasets. looking at literature, some reports describe the exploitation of these algorithms to make prediction about mirnas-target gene interactions for hcc, but the majority of these studies halted to the mirna profiling and the validation of target genes for a specific mirna  <cit> . in this paper, we moved forward in order to obtain a list of potential genes, all together related to a small group of significantly altered mirnas in hcc. so, we started to predict putative target genes by making use of relatively different bioinformatics algorithms . secondly, we conducted enrichment annotation analysis to identify functional clusters which could be related to those target genes. finally, we built up networks to visualize the possible circuits and pathways where the selected mirnas could be involved, providing a resource for further functional studies on hcc pathogenesis.

RESULTS
histological analysis
livers from den-treated and control mice were subjected to gross anatomical examination and microscopic analysis. little nodular structures  were observed in  <dig> % of mouse livers belonging to  <dig> months den-treated animals , whereas all of the mouse livers from  <dig> months group developed voluminous hepatic nodules . in total, fifty two nodular structures with maximal dimensions ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> cm were excised. infiltrating lymphocytes were shown already after  <dig> months from den treatment, indicating the presence of inflammatory processes . in particular,  <dig> % of hepatic tissue samples from  <dig> months den-treated animals showed infiltrating lymphocytes, and this percentage increased up to  <dig> % in the  <dig> months den-treated group. regarding the  <dig> months group, it was observed that  <dig> % of samples were characterized by lymphocyte infiltration . histological evaluation showed typical dysplastic alterations in samples from  <dig> months group . moreover,  <dig> months-hepatic tissues exhibited particular histological features such as hyperaemia, neo-angiogenesis, micronodules and wide fibrotic branches, showing a specific feature disrupting the normal hepatic lobular architecture .fig.  <dig> progressive liver damage induced by den. a-b) livers from mice sacrificed at  <dig>  and  <dig> months . dark arrows indicate nodular structures visible on liver’s surface. c) h&e staining showing normal hepatic parenchyma  from a control mouse sacrificed after  <dig> months. d-e) mouse hepatic tissues  from 3-  and 6-months  den-treated mice. dashed circle and arrows indicate the presence of infiltrating lymphocytes and cellular atypia. f) liver parenchyma from an 11-months den-treated mouse . marked hyperaemia, micronodules and high density of perisinusoidal lymphocytes are detected



mirnas expression
pooled rnas from whole hepatic tissues of mice sacrificed after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> months were subjected to mirnas’ expression analysis. several mirnas were found differentially expressed in hepatic tissues from den-treated animals, with respect to those from control mice, after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> months, and in tumors with respect to controls or peritumor liver tissues from den-treated animals. among them, and after a literature review, we focused our analysis on four mirnas , whose dysregulated expression was already described in hepatocarcinogenesis  and also observed in a high-fat diet-induced hepatocarcinogenesis c57bl/6j model we are analyzing , further supporting their putative role in liver cancer. we monitored the mirna expression level during the above-mentioned time-points . an expression increase of mir-125a-5p, which was up-regulated after  <dig> months, was detected in den mice. mir- <dig> was iso-expressed in den-treated groups at  <dig> and  <dig> months, whereas it was found to be up-regulated at  <dig> months. mir-193b appeared iso-expressed or weakly over-expressed during the experimental time points in den-treated animals. mir-27a appeared to be down-regulated at  <dig> months and showed high expression level at  <dig> and  <dig> months in den-treated mice with respect to controls. mir-125a-5p, mir- <dig>  mir-193b and mir-27a resulted all over-expressed in tumors in comparison to hepatic tissues from control mice, whereas mirna-125a-5p, mir- <dig> and mir-193b displayed over-expression or slight increase in the comparison between tumors and paired hepatic tissues from den-treated mice.table  <dig> relative expression of mirnas considered for the analysis in livers and tumors

target prediction
a bioinformatics workflow focused on identifying putative target genes with respect to our selected micrornas was set up and used for the study. a schematic representation is provided in fig.  <dig>  the first step of analysis involved the construction of a local database  that contained information related to mirnas and target prediction for mus musculus . the selected micrornas were analyzed by miranda, targetscan, pita, and rna- <dig>  which are some of the most used target prediction tools, in order to identify target genes all at once regulated by the four micrornas. the first two programs make predictions employing a conservation filter, whereas pita and rna- <dig> are based on free-energy criteria. miranda generated two lists including all targets with a good mirsvr score and a good conservation score, respectively. then, it searched for links among the lists and created an intersecting final table comprising all target genes with the highest two types of scores. in order to work with stringent criteria and to limit false positive prediction results, a list of  <dig> “good mirsvr score, non-conserved mirna” genes, containing the most probable target genes potentially interacting with those mirnas, was obtained. selected micrornas were then subjected to targetscan, by taking into consideration the pct score for measuring site conservation and for better translating the results from mouse to human. from the “conserved family info result” table, a total number of  <dig> genes was obtained. pita and rna- <dig> analysis resulted in a final group of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. all the data are described in more detail in an additional file . for the final analysis, we decided to consider only genes predicted by at least  <dig> of the above-mentioned  <dig> prediction programs. ank <dig> mrna was the unique target predicted by three different programs . in addition to ank <dig>  fourteen mrnas were predicted by  <dig> different programs .fig.  <dig> workflow of the mirna analysis. mir-125a-5p, mir-27a, mir-193b and mir- <dig> have been considered in our analysis. we look for their common targets on four on-line db  in order to obtain four predicted targets lists, one for each db. from these lists, only  <dig> targets have been considered. we gave the filtered list of targets as input to genemania in order to obtain a physical relation network. finally, we built up a network showing the relationships between mirnas and targets, as well as those among targets by using neo4j

ankg expression in livers and tumors
in order to assess the applicability and pertinence of the described workflow, liver tissues from  <dig> months den-treated and control mice as well as tumors from  <dig> months den-treated mice were analyzed for the expression of ankg, which is the protein product of ank <dig>  ankg isoforms at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda have been detected in mouse tissues  <cit> . results from immunoblotting  show a weaker expression of the  <dig> kda ankg isoform in liver tissues from  <dig> months den-treated mice with respect to those from  <dig> months controls, and a further reduced ankg expression is observed in tumors from  <dig> months den-treated animals. the results are in line with those evidenced in mirna expression analysis, which, on the contrary, show a corresponding mirnas’ expression level increase in den tissues and tumors. the evidences obtained provide a validation of in silico data.fig.  <dig> ankyrin-g expression levels in liver tissues and tumors. a from the top to the bottom: ankg expression in liver tissues from  <dig> months old untreated control mice, den-treated mice, and tumors, each excised from the corresponding mouse analyzed in the previous den panel . numbers indicate mice id, m marker. b densitometric analysis of the western blots presented in a. the intensity of the bands of ankg was normalised to the intensity of the actin bands, and the obtained values were plotted . the actin reference value was arbitrarily set to 1



enrichment annotation analysis and network construction
for the network construction and the enrichment annotation step, we took advantage of genemania  <cit> , which operated a schematic clusterization of the gene list, also reporting fdr  and gene coverage for each cluster. the results obtained were included in a neo4j database  <cit>  to provide a graphical representation of mirnas-targets interactions, including the  <dig> top target genes as well as  <dig> secondary genes . concerning the  <dig> top target genes, we extracted  <dig> significant clusters  regarding multiple cellular mechanisms such as ion transporter activity, regulation of receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway, protein import into nucleus, regulation of intracellular protein transport, regulation of cell adhesion, growth factor binding, positive regulation of pathway-restricted smad protein phosphorylation . five genes  appear with a “5-times” average in those categories. moreover, in order to check for significant categories specifically related to hepatic cancer, we extended the analysis to the whole  <dig> secondary genes set and we obtained  <dig> significant clusters . in addition, we focused the analysis on a subset of  <dig> out of  <dig> secondary genes which, on the basis of pubmed search results, appeared to be specifically described in liver tumor pathogenesis . in this case, we collected  <dig> significant functional clusters . regulation of tgf-beta/smad signaling pathway, which is known to be involved in liver damage and hcc  <cit> , was evidenced among the most significant and important clusters identified by the above-mentioned data elaborations .fig.  <dig> neo4j software graphical visualization of mirna-target interactions concerning the four considered mirnas in hcc. blue circles represent mirnas. green circles represent top target genes that are physically linked with secondary genes indicated by purple circles. orange circles represent top target genes that have no physical interactions. results are from genemania elaboration. edges indicate physical interactions



discussions
in the present study we show the results of a massive analysis for retrieving possible targets and pathways involved in the initiation and development of chemically-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, by using the c57bl/6j mouse model. the adoption of a combination of micrornas analysis and computational-based approach allowed us to produce a set of  <dig> top genes predicted to be the best potential targets for four micrornas . the following enrichment annotation analysis, performed both on the  <dig> top genes and the resulting secondary genes, allowed us to identify, among several pathways and genes involved in, some which plays an important role in liver tumor pathogenesis . among the  <dig> top targets, some protein products have been already described in oncogenesis and metastasis. ank <dig> seems to be the most solid candidate, being predicted by  <dig> out of  <dig> programs: in particular, it results a suitable target for mir- <dig>  which is greatly up-regulated at  <dig> months in tumor samples compared to controls. ank <dig>  in mouse, is distributed in several cell types, especially in renal, hepatic, muscular and nervous tissues, where different isoforms  have been detected  <cit> . our results show expression decrease of the protein product ankyrin g  in liver tissues from den-treated with respect to those from control mice, and a further reduced expression in tumors with respect to den peritumor tissues. data are in line with the contextual expression levels of mirnas in hepatic tissues and tumors, providing evidence about the effectiveness of the procedure here presented and used. ank <dig>  member of the ankyrin protein family , is typically known as epithelial ankyrin. its protein product acts as a bridge between the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton, where it links spectrin-proteins to integral membrane proteins and is involved in regulating cellular functions such as cell motility and proliferation  <cit> . in several human cancer types, ank <dig> appeared to be down-regulated contributing to a poor prognosis  <cit> . some authors proposed a possible connection between ank <dig> dysregulation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition   <cit> . they stated that decreased levels of ankyrin-g in tumoral cells caused by the emt process could free-up the neurotrophin receptor-interacting melanoma antigen  for translocation into the nucleus, where it could interact with the repressor protein tbx <dig> to suppress p14arf expression. in normal cells, p14arf acts to block nrage-tbx <dig> complex, allowing nrage sequestration by ankyrin-g. this confers sensitivity to “anoikis”, a specific apoptosis program activated when cells are able to detach from extracellular matrix and adhere to other substrates in order to limit their migration potential. therefore, it could be hypothesized that p14arf down-regulation could protect cancer cells from anoikis activation. an indirect confirmation of the ank3/emt relation comes from an interesting work  <cit>  where the role of hook <dig>  an interaction ank <dig> partner we previously observed in genemania network , was described in this phenomenon. the authors showed that hook <dig> displayed a regulatory effect on emt, since its overexpression led to emt inhibition. conversely, reduced hook <dig> expression level contributed to emt phenomenon. the existence of a physical link for ankyrin g and hook <dig> provide thus an additional clue to the hypothesized role of ank <dig> in the regulation of emt for tumor metastases  <cit> . another compelling mechanism involving a possible role of ank <dig> in cancer pathogenesis is presented by an elegant work by ignatiuk et al.  <cit>  where it was demonstrated that smaller isoforms of ank <dig>  called ank <dig> and ank <dig>  were able to bind the pdgfr-binding subunit of pi3k, p <dig>  influencing the lysosomal degradation of the receptor. these proteins, particularly expressed in liver, lack the repeat domain which is responsible for their positioning on plasma membrane and for this reason they localize to late endosomes and lysosomes to target materials to be degraded  <cit> . ank <dig> and- <dig> overexpressing-cells exhibited a rapid degradation followed by reduced levels of pdgf receptor and an overall minor sensitivity to proliferation upon pdgf stimulation. in hcc cells, down-regulation of these isoforms could lead to delayed pdgfr degradation that could give rise to a sustained signalling of pdgf and downstream pathways, resulting in enhanced proliferation. keeping in mind that pdgfr expression is reported to be up-regulated in hcc human livers  <cit> , focused analysis of this mechanism could be very intriguing to explore.

cyld, here identified as a potential mirnas target and in functional clusterization, is a protein implicated in the regulation of protein localization and transport inside the cells. cyld is a gene whose loss or mutations predispose to the development of human cylindroma, a particular type of hair follicle benign tumor. it encodes for a deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitously expressed, which is depicted as a tumor suppressor since it lacks its expression in various human tumor types  <cit> . cyld removes ubiquitin chains from different molecules, such as tnf receptor-associated factor 2/ <dig>  and b-cell limphoma- <dig> , thus participating in pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival  <cit> . literature reports illustrated some mechanisms specifically involving this gene in tumor tissues. pannem et al.  <cit>  showed that cyld-deficent mice developed hepatic tumors after den-treatment, using an animal model similar to that here described. at the molecular level, cyld down-regulation led to robust activation of jnk <dig> which reflected in c-myc levels stabilization and enhanced transcription of cyclin-d <dig>  this mechanism could justify the elevated proliferation rates observed in hcc cells. on the other hand, other researchers demonstrated also direct cyld cross-talk with nf-kb pathway  <cit> . in this case, cyld influenced this pathway through the control of bcl- <dig> localization. indeed, bcl- <dig> was able to associate with nf-kb heterodimers and triggered the transcription of nf-kb-related genes such as cyclin-d <dig>  but only when it was inside the nucleus  <cit> . in normal cells, bcl- <dig> was retained into the cytoplasm, due to the elimination of lys- <dig> polyubiquitin chains, a task mediated by cyld itself. during transformation, growth-promoting stimuli produced bcl- <dig> transfer from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region. here, decreasing cyld levels activated bcl <dig> accumulation followed by its import into the nucleus, probably mediated by an interaction between the polyubiquitin chains of bcl- <dig> and importins. once inside the nucleus, bcl- <dig> can bind to nf-kb to form a complex that was able to selectively recognize nf-kb binding sites, stimulating trascription of oncogenes. based on our findings, cyld was predicted to be a target of mir-125a-5p and mir- <dig>  effectively, cyld is validated for human mir- <dig>  according to mirtarbase   <cit> . in light of all these evidences, we can deduce that mir-125a-5p and mir- <dig> could modify cyld expression in cancerous tissues causing a marked reduction.

clusterization analysis reveals the presence of slc8a <dig> as an additional gene targeted by the selected micrornas. our data showed that this gene could be regulated by mir- <dig> and mir-27a which have been already described as over-expressed micrornas in human hcc cells  <cit> . slc8a <dig> belongs to the large family of solute carrier  transporters, proteins designated to transport different molecules including nutrients, metals, ions and drugs across the membranes  <cit> . generally, they are influx transporters and slc8a <dig> represents one of them. this gene encodes a protein, called ncx <dig>  which regulates the extra- and intracellular levels of sodium  and calcium , allowing na+ influx and ca++ efflux in normal conditions  <cit> . ncx <dig>  known as an important ca++ exchanger in plasma membrane, could invert this flux in pathological conditions, determining ca++ influx. this situation provokes a rise of intracellular calcium levels and the consequent activation of ca++-dependent signaling pathways that stimulate specific responses, such as apoptosis activation. in some human cancers, slc8a <dig> expression was shown to be decreased, producing a corresponding reduction of intracellular calcium levels which leads to apoptosis evasion and more sustained proliferation rate  <cit> . moreover, as described by januchowski et al.  <cit> , slc8a <dig> was addressed as responsible for multidrug resistance, one of the big problems in chemotherapeutic treatments. in this context, the authors documented a strong slc8a <dig> downregulation in several drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, claiming that it could represent an interesting therapeutic target for this malignancy. these data fit with our results; indeed, mir-27a and mir- <dig> up-regulation might be responsible of slc8a <dig> ipo-expression in hcc tissues. although there are no evidences in literature about slc8a <dig> expression level in hcc, a number of studies have described its lowered activity in other human cancers  <cit> . hence, it could be useful to evaluate its expression also in another completely different environment, like hcc could be.

another interesting gene linked to our group of selected mirnas and comprised in the  <dig> top target gene set is magi <dig> , which is a scaffold protein whose principal activity is to regulate and stabilize cell-cell contacts  <cit> . because of this activity, magi <dig> is considered an important regulator for cell junctions with tumor suppressor behaviour. some studies elucidated its functions stating that it recruits pten to the e-cadherin complexes located at junctional sites and, subsequently, induce pten to downregulate phosphatidylinositol- <dig> , <dig> trisphosphate pools, leading to the activation of the effector downstream molecules  <cit> . zhang et al. reported magi <dig> downregulation at mrna and protein level in hcc human tissues and they found a direct correlation between its reduced expression and a poor prognosis  <cit> . these results fitted with our predictions. in fact, our data indicated magi <dig> as a putative target for all of the four mirnas, in particular for mir- <dig>  considering that all of these mirnas were up-regulated in tumor tissues in our system, we could speculate that one or more of them could block the expression of magi <dig> in hcc tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
since their discovery, many advances were made about the understanding of microrna functions and their possible use for biomedical purposes. especially for cancer, an increasing number of studies highlighted their potential in defining diagnosis, prognosis and therapy and great efforts are being made to support the use of these molecules in clinical applications. in this work we combined biomolecular results, based on an in vivo model, with in silico analysis. we created a workflow able to connect mirnas, found to be dysregulated in chemically-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, to respective putative targets; then we generated a wide protein interaction network involving other proteins physically interacting with them. the workflow was validated by evaluating and confirming the expression levels of one among the micrornas’ predicted targets  in the animal model here described. in conclusion, the experimental procedure could be used and employed for further researches on hcc initiation, development and progression.
