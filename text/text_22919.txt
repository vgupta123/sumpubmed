BACKGROUND
the second internal transcriber spacer  is a fast evolving part of the nuclear-encoded rrna operon, located between  <dig> s and 28s rrna genes. to obtain mature, functional rrna molecules, the entire rrna operon is transcribed as a single precursor rrna, followed by complex excision processes of both its regions  <cit> . similar to introns and non-transcribed spacer regions, the primary sequence of its <dig> appears highly variable, however, the excision process of the its <dig> rna transcript  requires certain secondary structure motifs, which seem to be conserved across most eukaryotes  <cit> . its <dig> usually folds into a clover leaf-like secondary structure with four helices, two of which show additional sequence/structure motifs that again appear to be essential for successful excision of its <dig> from the precursor rrna molecule. in contrast to helix <dig> and helix  <dig>  which are highly variable in sequence and length, helix  <dig> is more conserved and almost always displays at least one pyrimidine-pyrimidine  mismatch  <cit> . helix  <dig> is usually much longer than the other helices, and its apical region shows high sequence conservation, often including a four nucleotide motif   <cit> . this motif is close to the crucial cleavage site c <dig> where the degradation process of its <dig>  i.e. the formation of the mature  <dig> s and 28s rrna, is initiated by a hitherto unidentified endonuclease  <cit> . only in a few eukaryotes the its <dig> apparently deviates from these common features  <cit> , or is absent altogether  <cit> .

the presence of a stable and functionally important rna secondary structure can be revealed by comparing homologous positions among different organisms, and searching for non-conserved, but co-evolving nucleotides, which maintain base pairing in the rna transcript, thus indicating the presence of intra-molecular rna helices  <cit> . generally, rna helices can retain base pairing by two evolutionary processes, double-sided changes , and single-sided changes. in the former, a substitution on one side of the helix , which would disrupt base pairing, can be compensated by changing the nucleotide at the opposite side . the whole double-sided change  is called compensatory base change . the existence of the non-canonical 'wobble' base pair , which is thermodynamically stable in rna molecules, allows even single-sided changes that perfectly retain base pairing, and are accordingly named hemi-compensatory base change .

for two reasons its <dig> is thought to be an excellent marker for molecular phylogenetic studies, especially at lower taxonomic levels. obviously, the highly divergent and fast-evolving its <dig> can discriminate among closely related organisms, which otherwise display almost identical sequences, e.g. in the conserved rrna genes. this explains the frequent use of its <dig> for calculation of lower-level phylogenetic trees in many eukaryotic lineages . in addition, its <dig> data have been used to predict the ability to interbreed successfully, thereby determining the limits between 'biological' species and populations  <cit> . the latter approach, introduced by coleman and coworkers, consists basically of a pairwise comparison of its <dig> secondary structures from closely related organisms, considering only compensatory changes within its <dig> helices. computing presence/absence of even a single compensatory base change  in the conserved regions of helices  <dig> and  <dig> of its <dig> revealed a correlation with incompatibility/ability to sexually cross  <cit> . in contrast, changes in the less conserved regions  as well as hcbcs in the conserved parts did not correlate with interbreeding ability. thus, coleman  <cit>  defined a group of organisms without any cbc in conserved its <dig> regions  as a cbc clade, which is distinguished from other cbc clades by at least one cbc in these regions. in addition, a group of organisms producing compatible gametes that can form zygotes was named z clade  <cit> . although members of different cbc clades apparently always fall into different z clades, which are isolated by reproduction barriers such as inability of gamete fusion or other pre-zygotic isolation mechanisms, it is still possible that the members of the same cbc clade are unable to mate, and thus fall into two or more z clades  <cit> . moreover, a single cbc clade/z clade is not necessarily equivalent to one 'biological species', defined by its fertile offspring, because a zygote may be unable to develop further due to post-zygotic barriers, e.g. failure to perform meiosis. in summary, a cbc clade corresponds to one or more z clades, which itself may contain one or more 'biological' species.

most described species have been defined solely on the basis of structural characters, and may be labeled 'morphospecies'. what is the relation of cbc clades, z clades, and 'biological' species to previously described morphospecies? unfortunately, no general rule can be applied here, as e.g. previously recognized by coleman  <cit> . as one extreme case, morphologically identical organisms, classified as a single taxonomic species, represent one cbc clade containing multiple z clades . at the other extreme, morphologically diverse organisms, classified as different species or even genera, can successfully interbreed, and then belong to the same z clade as well as cbc clade , and may be regarded as hybridization events .

it has nevertheless been concluded that among potential mates, increasing its <dig> divergence is correlated with decreasing potential for mating and zygote formation  <cit> . since there is no obvious functional link between its <dig> sequence and the process of gamete fusion, the observed correlation between cbcs and inability to cross has been explained by either similar or faster evolutionary rates of genes that control gamete interactions, compared to the rate of cbc-type changes in conserved its <dig> regions  <cit> .

therefore, it appears necessary to study the evolution of cbcs in paired its <dig> regions during recent and ancient diversification processes, and to estimate the frequency of these events in relation to mating barriers and the origin of new species. regarding the first aspect, it is currently unclear whether cbcs usually evolve via two simultaneous changes on both sides of a helix, or instead represent the sum of two changes that occurred at different times, either as a series of two consecutive hcbc-type substitutions, or involving a non-paired intermediate state. it is further unknown whether cbc/hcbc rates and frequencies are similar throughout its <dig> helices, or whether these parameters are unequally distributed among its <dig> base pairs due to cbc/hcbc hotspots or cbc/hcbc silencing. finally, regarding the importance especially of its <dig> cbcs for molecular taxonomic concepts, it appears surprising that the phylogeny of cbc-type changes usually plays no role in such analyses, whereas in other phylogenetic and taxonomic investigations, application of cladistic principles, i.e. strict distinction between plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states, is a commonality. in fact, cbcs are mostly visualized phenetically, i.e. as a pair-wise comparison between sister species . similarly, the homoplasy background of cbc-type substitutions in its <dig>  i.e. presence of reversals, parallelisms, and convergences, has not been analyzed so far.

in the present contribution, we investigated these questions in detail, selecting the green algal order ulvales  as a case study. the ulvales provide  many available its <dig> and 18s rdna sequences,  data from crossing experiments,  morphological and taxonomic diversity, and  distribution over freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats. we reconstructed a consensus its <dig> secondary structure for the ulvales, and introduced a new numbering system based on positional homology. by mapping all evolutionary changes that occurred in its <dig> helices across the investigated ulvales, we found that cbc clades mostly do not correlate with the level of 'biological' species, and are often paraphyletic assemblies  rather than genuine monophyletic  clades. furthermore, our analyses revealed cbcs and hcbcs as clearly independent evolutionary processes, which only rarely occurred in the same its <dig> base pairs, largely characterized different branches in the phylogenetic tree, and displayed different homoplasy background levels. in particular, we found no evidence that would support the hypothesis that cbcs evolved through two consecutive hcbcs.

RESULTS
folding methods for its2
using the programs mfold  <cit>  and rnastructure  <cit> , homologous regions of the its <dig> sequence were generally folded as comparable secondary structural motifs, and revealed four universal helices present in all  <dig> ulvales analyzed here . comparison of these universal helices across taxa identified several base-paired positions that retained pairing by covariation , or by a change in only one position . numerous cbcs and hcbcs confirmed the 'genuine' structure of its <dig>  and rejected artificial folding patterns.

using another tool for its <dig> secondary structure generation, i.e. 4sale  <cit>  combined with the its <dig> database iii  <cit> , resulted in conflicting folding patterns for different taxa, and the only common feature among these folds was the presence of four helices . however, these helices were often generated from non-homologous sequence regions, and thus could not be compared across taxa. a check of 'template models' from the its <dig> database iii revealed only a few ulvophyte its <dig> folds that, except for some discrepancies in helix  <dig>  corresponded to our consensus secondary structure model . although most other 'template models' of ulvophytes showed a correctly folded helix  <dig>  the remaining helices contained several folding errors, as is obvious from clearly homologous sequence motifs in non-comparable secondary structural placements .

consensus secondary structure model of its2
the its <dig> showed only moderate length variation across the ulvales, ranging from  <dig>  up to  <dig>  or  <dig> nucleotides . the high degree of secondary structure conservation allowed the unambiguous alignment of most its <dig> positions, and generation of a consensus secondary structure model of the its <dig> in the ulvales . this model included a variability map, i.e. all positions were classified into different categories:  100% conserved nucleotides,  highly conserved positions with only one unique change within the ulvales,  moderately conserved positions with 2- <dig> changes,  variable positions with >  <dig> changes,  expansion segments , and  specific insertions, i.e. positions that were present in only some taxa. in addition, comments in figure  <dig> provide an overview about taxonomic entities with unique evolutionary changes , and with its <dig> length variations .

within the ulvales, five its <dig> regions were well conserved in primary sequence and secondary structure:  the first 2- <dig> base pairs of helix  <dig>   the spacer between helix  <dig> and helix  <dig>   the basal part of helix  <dig>  containing  <dig> base pairs,  the spacer between helix  <dig> and helix  <dig>  and  the apical part of helix  <dig>  covering ca. 18- <dig> base pairs . the remaining its <dig> motifs, including helix  <dig> and the apical part of helix  <dig>  were much less conserved.

one major subclade of the ulvales, encompassing the families capsosiphonaceae and gomontiaceae  was characterized by an even higher conservation of its <dig> positions, and therefore, a separate consensus secondary structure model was designed for these two families . among these families, the consensus model revealed high conservation for several its <dig> regions, which were rather variable among other ulvales, e.g. the complete helix  <dig> .

one genus, kornmannia, was exceptional due to the presence of an additional helix, located between helix  <dig> and helix  <dig>  and an unusually long helix  <dig> .

introduction of a numbering system for its <dig> positions
the its <dig> consensus structure diagram  provided the opportunity to introduce a novel numbering system of its <dig> nucleotides for unambiguous positional descriptions of base pairs, cbcs, hcbcs, and indels. figure 1a revealed  <dig> homologous characters that were present in all ulvales investigated here. these  <dig> 'universal' characters served as the backbone of the new numbering system. in contrast, non-universal positions  were labeled with subscript numbers  combined with the 5' -preceding 'universal' nucleotide number . for example, 'universal' nt  <dig> at the 5´end of helix  <dig> is followed by two non-universal nucleotides that were present only in ulvaria and the u. lactuca clade, and these positions were named  <dig> and  <dig> . the additional helix unique for kornmannia was labeled in the same way . as universal position number 'one', we arbitrarily designated the first moderately conserved  nucleotide of its <dig>  since the 5'-end region was non-conserved in sequence and length .

its <dig> and 18s rdna phylogeny of the ulvales
its <dig> provided  <dig> alignable characters for phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> taxa in the ulvales . as an additional control, we performed phylogenetic analyses of an 18s rdna data set of  <dig> ulvales using  <dig> characters . the taxon sampling in both data sets was largely non-congruent since 18s rdna + its <dig> data were available for only  <dig> strains  in additional file  <dig> and figure 2). five families of the order ulvales and pseudoneochloris marina  were well represented in both alignments, whereas the families chlorocystidaceae and phaeophilaceae  were missing in the its <dig> data set.

although both phylogenies cannot be directly compared, the absence of conflicting branching patterns suggested that the phylogenetic signal in its <dig> was sufficient to resolve most relationships among the ulvales correctly. among basal branches  we observed almost no conflict case . however, overall support values differed considerably between 18s rdna and its <dig> phylogenies owing to the lower number of aligned its <dig> characters - all basal branches of families gained high support by 18s rdna data, whereas the corresponding branches in the its <dig> phylogeny were usually non-supported . the only exception was the family ulvaceae that gained high support by its <dig> also. at the genus and species level, several possible cases of conflict between 18s rdna and its <dig> analyses were observed, e.g. relationships among the genera acrochaete, umbraulva, ulvaria and percursaria. however, a reliable comparison between these phylogenies was not possible due to the non-congruent taxon sampling, and some likely misidentified taxa or presence of contaminations .

compensatory base changes  and hemi-compensatory base changes 
to identify all positions that co-evolved as double/single-sided changes in an its <dig> helix with conservation of base pairing  within the ulvales, an exhaustive apomorphy search was performed among paired its <dig> characters . in total,  <dig> cbcs were revealed over all helices and only  <dig> of these were discovered in the relatively conserved regions of helices  <dig> and  <dig>  and were collectively termed 'h2+3_cbcs' . in the same way, all  <dig> hcbcs have been depicted in figure  <dig> . from the  <dig> h2+3_cbcs only one  was adjacent to a bulge and this is the only example in which a pairing might have moved over one nucleotide on one strand . regarding hcbcs,  <dig> hcbcs from  <dig> h2+3_hcbcs were located next to a bulge. furthermore, two different categories of cbcs/hcbcs could be distinguished: cbcs/hcbcs that uniquely characterized a single branch/clade within the ulvales , and cbcs/hcbcs that evolved in a homoplasious manner .

all  <dig> cbcs and  <dig> hcbcs, including the homoplasious changes, were mapped upon the phylogenetic tree inferred from the its <dig> sequences comparisons , and were assigned to  <dig> and  <dig> clades/branches, respectively  where they evolved . interestingly, cbcs and hcbcs were distributed over both terminal and internal branches on the tree .

cbc clades and cbc grades
for cbc clade-based concepts of species delimitation, either helix  <dig> alone  or the relatively conserved regions of helices  <dig> and  <dig>  have been considered as essential. a group of organisms characterized by the absence of any cbcs in these conserved pairing regions of its <dig> has been defined as a cbc clade sensu coleman . in total  <dig> h2+3_cbcs were found in the ulvales  and were assigned to  <dig> branches/clades flagged by blue/red colors in bold in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> h2+3_cbcs and their appropriate branches were analyzed for matching the cbc clade definition sensu coleman  <cit> . in summary, only two of the  <dig> h2+3_cbcs were mapped on species-branches within species-rich genera .

furthermore, it has been revealed that four of  <dig> branches defined monophyletic cbc clades that differed from all 'outgroup' taxa by the presence of at least one h2+3_cbc . other major clades were also characterized by h2+3_cbcs, but contained nested subclades that again gained novel synapomorphic h2+3_cbcs. in these cases, the nested  subclades formed genuine cbc clades, whereas the remaining taxa  formed non-monophyletic assemblies of organisms, which were not distinguished by any cbc-type difference in helices  <dig> and  <dig> . in other words, we found the majority of the ulvales within non-monophyletic groups that clearly failed to meet the classical definition of cbc clades . because the term cbc clade is restricted to its <dig> clades  lacking of any h2+3_cbcs among its members  <cit> , we herein introduce the term 'cbc grade' , defining a non-monophyletic assemblage of organisms without any h2+3_cbc among its members. four of five cbc grades were differentiated from all non-members by at least one h2+3_cbc, i.e. delineated from derived taxa  as well as 'outgroup' taxa. as an example, all ulvaceae to the exclusion of the derived members acrochaete heteroclada and a. viridis  represented a single paraphyletic cbc grade, well differentiated from other ulvales by three h2+3_cbcs, and from a. heteroclada and a. viridis by one h2+3_cbc, respectively. similarly, the kornmanniaceae formed a cbc grade to the exclusion of kornmannia, which itself formed a terminal cbc clade.

as an exception, one of the cbc grades  was devoid of any synapomorphic cbc in the its <dig> helices. these  <dig> taxa shared plesiomorphic character states for all its <dig> base pairs in the conserved regions of helices  <dig> and  <dig>  and represented a 'plesiomorphic cbc grade', merely united by absence of any synapomorphy of the h2+3_cbc type.

usually, cbc substitutions between sister taxa are identified and quantified by pairwise comparison of their its <dig> secondary structures, i.e. by a phenetic rather than a phylogenetic approach. in one case  it became obvious that such a phenetic comparison can be misleading when the third relevant 'taxon', i.e. the common ancestor of a. heteroclada and a. viridis, is not taken into consideration . whereas the phenetic method would suggest that both taxa differ merely by a single hcbc, the synapomorphy search revealed presence of a cbc plus one hcbc, and thus identified a. viridis and a. heteroclada as two different species.

cbcs, hcbcs, branch lengths and evolutionary rates
to correlate the frequency of cbcs and hcbcs in its <dig> helices with the evolutionary rates of the branches where they occurred , these parameters were recorded for all  <dig> branches in the its <dig> phylogeny  and plotted as diagrams . the majority  of shorter branches  lacked any cbc and/or hcbc, and thus showed non-compensatory changes exclusively . thus, branch lengths appeared neither strictly correlated with the number of cbcs, nor hcbcs. however, when only those branches with one and two cbcs were considered, the number of cbcs seemed weakly correlated with branch lengths up to about  <dig> evolutionary steps . among the long branches , the relation to cbcs was unclear due to the low sampling , and the 'exceptional' long branch of bolbocoleon without any cbc. only the remaining two long branches  showed the highest observed numbers of cbcs , indicating some correlation with branch lengths. this correlation, however, appeared non-linear but instead resembled a hyperbolic saturation curve. to analyze saturation, we calculated the cbc vs. branch length ratio , and clearly found negative correlation between cbc_r  and branch lengths. as an example, all four evolutionary steps that constituted the short branch of gloeotilopsis sp. acoi co-evolved as two cbcs , whereas in kornmannia, only eight out of  <dig>  evolutionary steps made up four cbcs.

regarding hcbcs, the relation to branch lengths was unclear due to the generally low number of hcbcs per branch, i.e. mostly one, rarely two , or three . among clades with >  <dig> hcbcs, the hcbc vs. branch length ratio  was similarly decreasing between the short branches  and the longer branches where hcbc_r approached  <dig> % for kornmannia , again indicating saturation.

evolutionary relationship between cbcs and hcbcs, and their parallelisms, convergences, and reversals
when cbcs and hcbcs were mapped upon clades/branches of phylogenetic trees using an exhaustive synapomorphy search, their occurrence was clearly non-correlated with each other . only  <dig> branches shared cbcs + hcbcs , whereas 12/ <dig> branches displayed cbcs/hcbcs exclusively . branches with exclusive cbc support  represented eight terminal branches as well as four internal divergences. similarly, their hcbc counterparts  were distributed over  <dig> terminal and  <dig> internal branches.

the synapomorphy search strategy further revealed all existing homoplasious changes of its <dig> base pairs, i.e., all parallelisms, convergences, and reversals of cbcs and hcbcs in the ulvales . these homoplasies were also mapped on the tree topologies, associated with branches . as a parallelism, we regarded identical evolutionary changes in unrelated lineages, starting from the same plesiomorphic character state, and applied a simple numbering system, i.e. par <dig>  par  <dig> etc. for parallel cbcs, and hpar <dig>  hpar <dig> etc. for hcbcs. a given parallelism can refer to up to five unrelated lineages . convergences differed from parallelisms by starting from different ancestral character states, e.g. g-c ⇒ a-u and u-a ⇒ a-u . a change back to a plesiomorphic character state, i.e. a reversal, was labeled rev for cbcs, and hrev for hcbcs. figure  <dig> provides selected examples for these homoplasious changes that occurred in pairs 54/ <dig> and 55/ <dig> in the basal part of helix  <dig>  by showing alignments, folding diagrams, and evolutionary changes.

as a result, the homoplasy background underlying cbc-type changes differed profoundly from homoplasy frequences found for hcbcs in the ulvales. regarding parallelisms,  <dig> of  <dig> total cbcs  evolved as parallelisms, occurring in seven its <dig> base pairs , whereas among all  <dig> hcbc,  <dig>  represented parallelisms in  <dig> its <dig> pairs . the much higher homoplasy level of hcbcs was also mirrored by the remaining homoplasy types. among the reversals, only two cases of the cbc-type were found, which both occurred in the same highly variable base pair in helix  <dig> . in contrast, we found six hcbcs that represented reversals towards the ancestral character state . we even found a twofold switch between ancestral and derived character states via hcbc-type reversals. as a synapomorphy in base pair 58/ <dig>  c-g changed to u-g in the genus ulva, followed by a reversal in one major ulva subclade  and a more recent second reversal in u. californica ab <dig> . notably, convergences were confined to the cbc category exclusively, and occurred three times in two its <dig> base pairs .

to further investigate the relation between cbcs and hcbcs, their frequencies of occurrence and frequencies of homoplasies were mapped upon all universal base pairs of its <dig> helices . again, cbcs as well as hcbcs were unequally distributed, i.e., non-correlated. cbcs occurred frequently in helix  <dig> and the basal part of helix  <dig>  in these 'variable' regions, cbcs evolved with a high homoplasy background including all recovered rev and conv-type homoplasies, whereas in the conserved parts of helices  <dig> and  <dig> very few homoplasious cbc-type changes occurred . hemi-cbcs showed the opposite tendency - low frequency in helix  <dig>  but much higher frequencies of occurrence in the remaining regions of its <dig> helices, including the conserved regions . except for helix  <dig>  the homoplasy background underlying hcbcs was equally high throughout its <dig> base pairs .

addressing individual base pairs in figure  <dig> revealed even more than a non-correlation between cbcs and hcbcs - actually, co-occurrence of cbcs and hcbcs in the same base pair was exceptional. in the ulvales, only seven base pairs displayed cbcs + hcbcs , whereas  <dig> pairs either evolved exclusively via cbcs  or exclusively via hcbcs .

it may be assumed that cbcs of the c-g ⇔ u-a category may often have originated by two consecutive hcbc-type substitutions, i.e. following the pathway c-g ⇔u-g ⇔ u-a. therefore, we investigated the contribution of hcbcs to the observed cbcs in its <dig> helices of the ulvales, and surprisingly found no single case supporting the above-mentioned theoretical pathway. in our case study, this result can neither be explained by low frequency of the c-g ⇔ u-a category, nor of the respective single hcbcs . in figure  <dig>  we listed canonical  and 'wobble'  rna base pairs, taking into account their orientation in the helix, and the frequency of all possible single  and double  substitutions that retain base pairing in the ulvales. obviously, almost all above-mentioned changes occurred during its <dig> evolution of the ulvales, mostly with high overall frequencies, except for 5'-u-g-3' ⇒ u-a , 5'-a-u-3' ⇒ g-u  and the reverse change . especially, the theoretical pathway 5'-u-a-3' ⇒ u-g ⇒ c-g appeared well supported by high frequencies of the individual hcbc categories, as well as the frequently found direct cbc change . however, most of the individual hcbcs referred to different its <dig> base pairs, and thus cannot be regarded as intermediates in the evolution of a cbc. only one base pair in helix  <dig>  showed all character states required for the hypothetical hcbc pathway  in different taxa . since in all phylogenetic analyses these taxa formed unrelated terminal branches within three families, rather than forming a single phyletic series , they gained their character states in position 8/ <dig> independently , and therefore cannot be considered as an example of a cbc that was gained by two consecutive hcbcs . in summary, hcbcs evolved with a different homoplasy background, changed on different branches in the phylogeny of the ulvales, largely preferred different its <dig> base pairs than those yielding cbcs, and did not contribute to cbcs observed in its <dig> helices of the ulvales.

discussion
in the present contribution we developed a suite of methods to gain 'close-up' insights into its <dig> evolution that may guide future studies of its diversification in general. therefore, we propose a general strategy for studies of its evolution and phylogeny, starting with the minimal requirements of the data set. its sequences differ from most other molecular markers by their low primary sequence and length conservation, and only the common intra-molecular folding pattern of their rna transcripts, i.e. their secondary structure, allows comparative investigations. the correctly folded secondary structure is fundamental not only for improving the alignment  <cit> , but also for building the alignment itself  as well as for identifying and detecting synapomorphies. in fact, the secondary structure is a prerequisite for all conclusions derived from the phylogenetic analyses. even with many available sequences, deciphering the 'genuine' secondary structure is a demanding procedure, since the initial secondary structure folding process of a single its <dig> sequence  often yields several alternative folds, and must be performed with its <dig> sequences from as many closely/distantly related taxa as is possible, to select the common folding pattern, substantiated by occurrence of cbcs and hcbcs  <cit> . to simplify this analysis, an alternative, standardized procedure has been developed in which a novel its <dig> sequence is automatically compared to >  <dig>  sequences in the its <dig> database iii with known secondary structures as a reference  <cit> . however, for selected its <dig> sequences of the ulvales, we obtained clearly false folding patterns using the its <dig> database iii. this is especially surprising since the authors described their criteria for how to evaluate the quality of secondary structure models, e.g. presence of four helices with conserved helix length distribution, and a uggu motif near the 5' site apex of helix iii  <cit> . however, some of the artificial 'reference' its <dig> structures of the ulvales were in conflict with these criteria. moreover, even structures that comply with the standards may often represent artifacts, as shown here for the ulvales. as a conclusion, the time-consuming manual approach to identify the common its <dig> secondary structure for a selected group of organisms as done here cannot be abbreviated by a semi-automated procedure without significant loss of accuracy.

fortunately, the its <dig> sequences of the order ulvales proved to be an almost ideal model for comparative structural and phylogenetic studies. these sequences were unusually well conserved in length, and contained many, almost invariable sequence motifs, which allowed high-quality alignments. sequence conservation allowed integration of more than  <dig> its <dig> sequences of the ulvales, which together represented five families, within a single alignment - so far a unique case in the algae where an its <dig> data set is usually confined to a single family or genus. furthermore, most its <dig> folds  spontaneously favored the same overall secondary structure, which corresponded well with already known its <dig> features in other green algae  <cit> . hallmarks of this common secondary structure, as e.g. the start/end of the four helices, and the spacers between helices, could easily be related to highly conserved sequence motifs in the its <dig> alignment. even the most highly divergent its <dig> regions that were not alignable by manual sequence comparison showed excellent secondary structure conservation that allowed an unambiguous alignment across all ulvales, except for the apical parts of the four helices. in consequence, each column in the alignable its <dig> regions represents a single homologous character, which applies not only for the paired positions but also for single-stranded spacer and internal loop regions.

to achieve an ulvales-wide system to identify and number its2-nucleotides as a statement of positional homology, all unambiguously aligned positions were either classified as 'universal', i.e., present across all ulvales, or 'non-universal', i.e. existing in only some ulvales and thus being subject to insertion/deletion events. only the first group of nucleotides were given 'universal' position numbers , allowing a clear nomenclature of e.g. its <dig> base pairs. these universal positions covered the whole range between invariable, moderately variable, and highly variable characters. to specify the conservation status of individual positions, usually a majority rule consensus is generated across the taxa investigated, e.g. a character that is g in  <dig> out of  <dig> taxa is termed '80% conserved'  <cit> . here, we instead used the absolute number of changes in the evolution of a given character as a more appropriate measure of its degree of conservation. as an example, both positions of base pair 29/ <dig> changed only once in the evolution of the ulvales in the common ancestor of a taxon-rich family, the ulvaceae. thus, by simple majority rule consensus these characters would be regarded as 'less than 55% conserved', whereas our evolutionary measure  clearly reveals their high conservation.

following clarification of homology, universality, nomenclature, and the degree of variation of its <dig> characters, summarized in consensus secondary structure diagrams, all character state changes  of each position could be investigated in detail to deduce the rules under which its <dig> evolved towards its current diversity. as a method, the previously developed synapomorphy search procedure  <cit>  automatically generated a complete inventory of all substitutions of its <dig> positions within the ulvales, and in addition, precisely identified the branches in the phylogenetic tree where these substitutions occurred. since the most interesting questions regarding its <dig> evolution are related to the paired positions in the double-stranded helices, the resulting list of single-character evolutionary changes was analyzed manually to trace the evolution of all known base pairs for  co-evolution by maintaining base pairing via cbc, and  single-sided changes retaining pairing via hcbc. the result of this screen is an overview of all recent cbc- or hcbc-type changes underlying terminal branches, as well as changes that characterize basal divergences in the phylogeny of the ulvales. especially the latter point marks a difference to other studies where its sequences of extant taxa are compared without consideration of evolutionary changes that led to these sequences  <cit> .

are cbc frequencies proportional to the overall sequence divergence? to analyze this question, previous investigators  <cit>  plotted the its-distances between pairs of extant taxa against the number of cbcs, and found similar relations: cbc-frequencies  are increasing from low to medium distance values, while for highly diverging pairs of sequences the number of cbcs is relatively small, indicating saturation. surprisingly, this distribution was analyzed by linear regression methods and then characterized as 'linear proportional relation'  <cit> . in the present study, synapomorphy searches revealed all cbcs, and precisely identified the branches on which they occurred. these data allowed a phylogenetic rather than a statistical approach, i.e. by plotting cbc frequencies versus the length  of the respective internal or terminal branch. for the ulvales, we also found a saturation-type relation between cbc frequencies and branch lengths, with the cbc vs. branch length ratio  being negatively correlated with branch lengths. in their study on myrtaceae  <cit> , the authors assumed 'unobserved' substitutions for the distant sequence comparisons, i.e. reversals, as one reason for the low number of observed cbcs, and also noticed that cbcs actually occur at relatively few sites in its molecules. we fully confirmed the latter phenomenon - out of  <dig> 'universal' base pairs in its <dig>  only  <dig> pairs underwent cbc-type changes throughout the entire order ulvales. in other words, the limited number of sites that can per se evolve via cbcs may be the major reason for the unexpectedly low number of cbcs in divergent branches or taxa. as an example, the long branch of kornmannia , which could theoretically involve up to  <dig> cbcs, actually shows cbcs at only four sites. as an alternative explanation for the observed saturation in divergent branches or taxa, a high rate of 'unobserved' cbcs may be assumed, i.e. cbcs, which were immediately reverted towards the ancestral state. however, the synapomorphy analysis/mapping approach performed here allowed precise quantification of cbc-type reversals throughout the ulvales: among  <dig> cbcs, we found only two reversals. therefore, it appears very unlikely that high rates of 'unobserved' cbcs contributed to cbc saturation in the ulvales. all these data suggest that cbcs represent a complex evolutionary process, which at higher divergence levels is constrained by available sites in its <dig> rather than depending simply on overall sequence divergence.

it is usually assumed that a cbc cannot evolve by two simultaneous substitutions, given the low evolutionary rates of most paired positions in its <dig>  <cit> . instead, a cbc may have evolved by two single-sided changes within a short time, and usually, the 'wobble' pair  is assumed as intermediate, suggesting the series a-u ⇔ g-u ⇔ g-c that represents two consecutive hcbcs  <cit> . as an alternative scenario, the intermediate stage may comprise mismatching nucleotides . although the '2x hcbc → cbc' scenario seems attractive, it only applies for one case of cbc , and not to any of the remaining observed cbc categories . a popular approach to address this question is to determine frequencies of the respective changes. in the ulvales, hcbcs of the a-u ⇔ g-u type as well as the g-u ⇔ g-c type were observed at high numbers, suggesting that in fact cbcs may have evolved via two subsequent hcbc-steps. however, such a summarizing view of overall substitution rates, which is often applied as the only source of evidence , can be misleading for two reasons. first, these hcbcs may have occurred at different positions , and second, even if these hcbcs referred to the same its base pair, they may have evolved independently in organisms that do not form a phyletic series. in fact, our synapomorphy analysis readily revealed that almost all pairs of hcbcs, which could theoretically form a 2-step cbc, occurred in different its <dig> positions, and already this spatial separation within the its <dig> molecule makes any causal relation between cbcs and hcbcs highly unlikely. only in a single case, both hcbcs required for a full 2-step cbc mapped upon the same its <dig> position in helix  <dig> . however, the respective taxa were unrelated to each other, highlighting that both hcbcs emerged as independent evolutionary events that did not converge towards a cbc. the simple formula 2x hcbc → cbc can at best be regarded as an exceptional scenario, which, however, could not be demonstrated in the ulvales. in contrast to the misleading conclusions derived from statistical methods, the specific reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of its <dig> base pairs via synapomorphy analysis resolved this question.

are cbcs and hcbcs equally distributed over its <dig> positions, or can one recognize distinct positional preferences? in fact, only seven pairs in the entire its <dig> molecule displayed both cbcs and hcbcs, whereas all remaining pairs appeared 'specialized' to either category of change. already this simple observation is difficult to reconcile with the notion that the majority of cbcs followed a '2x hcbc → cbc' pathway.

taken together, a hcbc appears to be a stable substitution, suggesting that the 'wobble' pair  is not at a disadvantage compared with 'canonical' base pairs  <cit> . in other words, when a canonical pair underwent a hcbc that lead to g-u, there was no selection pressure in favor of an immediate second hcbc restoring a canonical pair. in the ulvales, we found similar preferences for both directions of hcbcs:  <dig> hcbcs of the canonical → 'wobble' pair type, and a comparable number  of the 'wobble' → canonical pair type. comparisons of models of rna sequence evolution, using its data from angiosperms, also suggested absence of strong selection against non-canonical base pairs  <cit> . interestingly, the evolutionary behavior of the 'wobble' pair is strongly biased in the ulvales: we observed only a single hcbc of the g-u/u-g → a-u/u-a type, versus  <dig> hcbc in the g-u/u-g → g-c/c-g categories. a similar bias has been reported for some angiosperm families  <cit> . it seems attractive to explain such a bias in substitution rates by unequal frequencies of g-c/c-g  and a-u/u-a pairs , as e.g. done by  <cit> . however, this conclusion is illegitimate , and we favor another explanation, regarding functional constraints underlying a 'wobble' pair  allow rapid ecological adaptation processes, in contrast to two-step cbc-type changes.

how did double-sided cbcs in its <dig> actually evolve? we favor a 2-step scenario that involves a non-pair as a short-living intermediate, i.e. n-n → n×n → n-n. in contrast to the '2x hcbc → cbc' scenario, this pathway holds for all cbc categories . at least for base pairs under functional constraints, it should be assumed that any spontaneous single-sided substitution leading to a non-pair is disadvantageous, with impaired its <dig> folding and excision characteristics  <cit> . this event will usually lead to strongly reduced fitness or even extinction of the mutant genotype  <cit> . alternatively, mutants may escape extinction by intragenomic rrna homogenization, which reverts the mutation and thus restores its <dig> functions and fitness  <cit> . with respect to extant organisms, extinction of mutants as well as rrna homogenization processes cannot be readily investigated. however, we may be able to recognize selection against non-pairs in the double-stranded backbone of its <dig> helices, by comparison of non-compensating changes  versus overall frequencies of cbcs and hcbcs  <cit> . in fact, disruption of pairs  and restoration of pairing  both occurred at much lower frequencies  than cbcs and hcbcs . several of the conserved pairs even evolved exclusively by compensating changes, without any non-pairs. in the apical part of helix  <dig>  however, we found a few 'exceptional' positions that were almost universally paired, but evolved towards non-pairs within suprageneric clades  or even whole families . how is it possible that the mismatch status remained stable over long periods of time? all these 'exceptional' non-pairs are surrounded by several conserved pairs, which, we suspect, in combination lead to strong thermodynamic stability of this helix  <cit> . therefore, a few isolated non-pairs in helix  <dig> do apparently not reduce fitness and viability of the respective organisms, since e.g. the three families listed above belong to the ecologically most successful green algae in marine and coastal environments  <cit> .

our data regarding helix  <dig> provide the strongest evidence of selection against mismatch pairs - among  <dig> universal base pairs, nine were invariably double-stranded in all ulvales and evolved exclusively by cbcs and hcbcs. only the most variable pair 30/ <dig> located just before the expansion region showed a few cases of mismatch. it should be noted that the two- dimensional shape of helix  <dig> is regarded as a highly conserved 'hallmark' of the its <dig> core structure, i.e. a basal stem comprising about five base pairs, followed by a short internal loop  consisting of 1- <dig> pyrimidine-pyrimidine mismatches, and an apical stem+loop region  <cit> . experimental changes of this secondary structure by mutagenesis leads to failure in its <dig> excision at the transcript level, and especially, introduction of even one additional non-pair in the stem region is sufficient to prevent efficient pre-rna processing  <cit> . this corresponds well with our investigations in the ulvales - such a change is perhaps not viable. however, only the basal pair of helix  <dig> is invariant in the order, whereas all remaining pairs evolved at moderate rates, and - except pair 30/ <dig> - lacked changes that interrupt base pairing. although it might initially seem paradoxical, we assume that especially in these cases cbcs may have originated via non-paired intermediate steps, which in most cases were rapidly eliminated by natural selection . as a rare event, a lethal mismatch pair regained the essential base pairing by a second substitution, which must have occurred within a short time frame. as an example, the c-g → g-c cbc in pair 23/ <dig> in helix  <dig> may have evolved via short-living cxc or gxg mismatch state.

to substantiate our hypothesis that in its <dig> cbcs and hcbcs follow different evolutionary rules, we further investigated their homoplasious changes, i.e. parallelisms, convergences, and reversals. fortunately, the problem to distinguish these three types of homoplasy was readily achieved by our approach of direct mapping of all substitutions in its <dig> base pairs, in contrast to indirect statistical methods, e.g. calculating a homoplasy index  <cit> . as a first insight, parallelisms seem to be the most frequent case of homoplasy in its <dig>  followed by reversals and convergences. interestingly, parallelisms and especially reversals occurred much more frequently in the hcbc category. considering the only slightly higher number of hcbcs  versus cbcs , we observed twice the number of parallelisms , and even a threefold increase of hcbc-type reversals . the remaining homoplasy category, i.e. convergence, shows the opposite tendency: we found five cases of cbc-type convergences, but no such event among hcbcs . this appears surprising, since there are only two possible pathways for hcbc-type convergences , and most of these individual substitutions happened rather frequently . however, all these individual substitutions referred to different base pairs in its <dig>  and therefore did not contribute to any hcbc-type convergence. what is the reason for the higher rate of cbc-type convergences? the explanation may be the higher number of possible pathways, since every base pair can directly originate via cbcs from four other pairs . as an example, a-u can theoretically evolve from g-c, u-a, u-g, or c-g. notably, all these changes were found in the ulvales  and in some cases referred to the same its <dig> position, thus leading to the observed cbc-type convergences .

since cbcs and hcbcs showed clear positional preferences , it is not surprising that their homoplasies are also spatially separated in the its <dig> molecule. among  <dig> homoplasious positions, only two showed cbc- as well as hcbc homoplasies . interestingly, the most conservative regions of the its <dig>  i.e. the conserved parts of helix  <dig> and  <dig>  were both characterized by very low frequencies of cbc-type homoplasies accompanied by unusually high rates of hcbc homoplasies . this phenomenon might explain why several authors have restricted their conclusions to  these conserved parts of its <dig>  and  to cbcs. obviously, most cbcs in the conserved regions are non-homoplasious changes, and thus offer informative molecular signatures, which unambiguously characterize taxa and clades . in contrast, hcbc are usually considered as taxonomically meaningless , and this is mirrored by e.g. elevated homoplasy levels even in the conserved regions, and very high substitution rates.

can we explain the observed substitution rates of cbcs and hcbcs in the its <dig> with empirical frequencies of the respective base pairs? it might appear logical to assume that a high frequency of a given base pair should correlate with a high rate of substitutions leading to that base pair. within the ulvales, g-c and c-g are the most frequently occurring base pairs in its <dig> , whereas the four remaining pairs were comparatively rare, each counting for only 7-8% . assuming a frequency-substitution rate correlation, we should observe the highest substitution rates for 'frequent ⇔ frequent' cbcs , lower rates for 'frequent ⇔ rare' interchanges , and the lowest substitution rates for the category 'rare ⇔ rare' . our data clearly reject such a correlation, and rather show almost complete independence between frequency and substitution rates. for example, a direct 'rare → rare' cbc  shows the same rate as c-g → g-c from the 'frequent → frequent' category. clearly, the highest observed substitution rates were found among the 'frequent ⇔ rare' interchanges, and this holds for the highest cbc-rates  as well as the highest hcbc rates .

how can we explain that substitution rates are obviously independent of frequencies? first, several base pairs in its <dig> are essential for proper secondary structure folding, and thus are under strict functional constraints. not surprisingly, several strong g-c and c-g pairs contribute to its <dig> stability, and thus are conserved or even invariant, as shown in the its <dig> secondary structure diagram , explaining the unexpectedly low number of observed changes. however, there is also a general reason why frequencies cannot be correlated with substitution rates - observed frequencies apply to sequences of extant taxa only, whereas substitution rates refer to ancient as well as recent evolutionary changes. this means, that a single early occurring change, mapped upon a deep branch in the phylogenetic tree, will affect several descendent taxa and will thus considerably influence the base pair frequency distribution among recent taxa. in contrast, a recent substitution, mapped upon shallow or terminal branches, changes the base pair frequency of only few or even single taxa, with almost no effect on the observed overall frequencies.

as an example, in the ulvales and also in angiosperms  <cit> , the 'wobble' pairs g-u/u-g display much higher substitution rates with g-c/c-g than with a-u/u-a .  <cit>  argued that this bias in substitution rates is simply the result of the several fold higher frequencies of g-c/c-g versus a-u/u-a. for the above-mentioned reasons, this argument is inconclusive, and we instead propose functional constraints under adaptive processes as a possible explanation for the observed bias .

what is the significance of its <dig> for taxonomy and species definition in the ulvales? so far, the its <dig> molecule has only rarely been used as marker for phylogenetic analyses in the ulvales, except in studies of single genera . thus, its <dig> is an exceptionally informative phylogenetic marker in the ulvales , especially with respect to the relatively low number of alignable positions, and in future should be analyzed in combination with congruent data sets of other genes.

however, the most spectacular evolutionary aspect regarding its <dig> concerns its potential to predict sexual compatibility  among closely related organisms, thereby defining the level of 'biological' species. one of the most recent proposals is that any cbc in the its <dig> is informative, and when two its <dig> sequences differ by at least one cbc, they likely represent two species  <cit> . although the predicted its <dig> secondary structure in the ulvales shows a high degree of conservation, we found it very difficult, sometimes impossible or at least subjective to align the highly variable regions . applying the proposal by müller et al.  <cit> , variations in its <dig> lengths  would automatically result in the recognition of more species, an untenable situation. we therefore favour the more conservative proposal by coleman  <cit>  which refers to the presence of at least one cbc between two organisms in the conserved regions of its <dig> predicting a failure to sexually cross, i.e. these organisms represent two different species. ideally, cbcs should have evolved at  approximately the same rate in sister lineages, and  at approximately the same or slightly slower rates than genes that control gamete compatibility. as a consequence, the 'first' cbcs should appear at about the same time, associated with shallow divergences in the phylogenetic tree, and should define several parallel clades  that might correspond to 'biological' species. in this scenario, those branches where 'first' cbcs occurred could be connected by a single vertical line as e.g. shown in a cartoon phylogenetic tree  <cit> . in the ulvales, we found that none of these 'ideal' assumptions is fulfilled.

clearly, many 'first' cbcs in the ulvales are not associated with shallow branches at the level of 'biological' species, but instead mapped upon deep divergences representing the levels of genera, families, or even higher taxonomic levels. only a few taxonomic species were equivalent to single cbc clades, e.g. collinsiella tuberculata. most cbc clades  within the ulvales are therefore based on deep-branching cbcs, and each of them contains up to about  <dig> taxonomic species in several genera. analysis concentrating on the its <dig> region of the volvocaeae revealed a remarkable correspondence between cbc clade, z clade and species ,  <cit> . is it, therefore, possible that each of these comprehensive cbc clades in fact represents only a single species, containing a diverging population of several morphotypes that are still able to cross? unfortunately, the crossing capability of most species of the ulvales analyzed here has not been investigated, but the limited evidence available may already address this question. species of ulva are well separated from each other by gametic mating barriers, as e.g. studied in detail for the same strains of u. ohnoi, u. reticulata and u. fasciata that were investigated here  <cit> . these three species form one of many subclades within the large cbc clade sensu coleman that includes the entire genus ulva as well as most other members of the family ulvaceae. further observations regarding morphological organization , ultrastructural characterization - e.g. presence/absence of scales on zoospores/aplanospores/gametes  <cit>  and type of habitat e.g.  <cit>  in other ulvales lead to the same conclusion. for example, the macroalgae protomonostroma  and capsosiphon , as well as the branched filamentous chamaetrichon  and several unbranched filamentous microalgae  are not differentiated by a cbc in the highly conserved regions of helices  <dig> and  <dig> 

in summary, genes controlling gamete compatibility as well as genes involved in structural differentiation apparently evolved much faster than most cbcs in the its <dig> of the ulvales.

the scattered, non-synchronous distribution of cbcs has another, unexpected consequence. several major cbc clades, which are based on ancient cbc events, contain nested cbc clades that originated by more recent cbcs. thus, only the latter category is monophyletic, whereas the major cbc clades, deeply rooted in the phylogenetic tree, usually form paraphyletic groupings, here termed cbc grades. in the ulvales, only a few taxa fall into one of the four 'genuine' cbc clades, whereas most taxa are distributed among five comprehensive cbc grades. in other words, the absence of a cbc in the highly conserved regions of helices  <dig> and  <dig> does not imply the presence of a monophyletic group nor is indicative of a close relationship  among the taxa that share this trait. it remains to be determined whether non-synchronization of 'first' cbcs and thus predominance of cbc grades is a special feature of the ulvales, or is widely distributed among eukaryotes.

mapping all cbcs on the phylogenetic tree is the only method to distinguish between 'genuine' cbc clades and cbc grades. coleman  <cit>  already mapped cbcs in helices  <dig> and  <dig> of its <dig> upon the phylogeny of pandorina isolates, similar to our approach, and to our knowledge this is still the only published reference. although most members of pandorina analyzed formed cbc  clades, the tree revealed the presence of cbc grades that contained isolates which are less closely related to each other than isolates that are excluded from the grade - because of the presence of a specific cbc . unfortunately, its <dig> comparisons including cbc-concepts are commonly performed in a more simple way, i.e. by pairwise comparison between two taxa . this 'phenetic' approach usually does not consider the phylogenetic history of cbc-type substitutions , and for different reasons it can lead to wrong conclusions . in the case of distantly related taxa, pairwise comparison is always impaired by the possibility of homoplasious changes. all homoplasy types  can lead to similar or even identical sequences in unrelated organisms. even in the case of sister taxa, pairwise comparison of its <dig> cbcs is illegitimate unless the character state in their last common ancestor is taken into consideration. the discrepancy between a phenetic vs. a phylogenetic approach was highlighted here for two sister species of acrochaete . in one base pair located in the conserved part of helix  <dig>  a. viridis and a. heteroclada seem to differ by a single hcbc only , resulting from pairwise comparison. however, the ancestral state of this pair in their last common ancestor was g-c, and thus, a. viridis evolved via cbc , whereas its sister species differs from the ancestor by one hcbc . phenetic pairwise comparison would therefore predict possible mating ability, whereas the phylogenetic analysis resolves a. viridis as a separate species, likely unable to mate with its sister species.

our case study in the ulvales demonstrated several discrepancies in the generally accepted assumptions underlying its <dig> evolution and taxonomic concepts based on its <dig> characters. we hope that this study will stimulate others to investigate its <dig> data in greater detail by directly tracing the evolutionary history of individual characters instead of relying on indirect statistical methods only. as soon as such 'close-up' views on its <dig> evolution are available for other groups of eukaryotes, it may be possible to re-evaluate the significance of its <dig> sequence variations for evolution, taxonomy, and speciation processes in eukaryotes in general.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study of the green algal order ulvales revealed novel and surprising insights into processes underlying its <dig> evolution and the taxonomic significance of its <dig> characters. 1) many cbc clades sensu coleman are paraphyletic. the cbc clades sensu coleman are not stable over time, since later evolving cbcs result in new cbc clades which are nested in their 'parent cbc clades' thus changing the status of the former towards paraphyletic grades, here germed cbc grades. 2) the occurrence of cbcs is not restricted to terminal branches and cbc clades are therefore not indicative of recent speciation events. instead, mapping of cbcs upon the its <dig> phylogeny reveals spreading of cbcs over both deep and terminal divergences. most terminal, species-level branches are not associated with cbc events, demonstrating that the genes, which control speciation processes via gametic compatibility evolved considerably faster than the conserved parts of helices  <dig> and  <dig> of its <dig>  3) phenetics can be misleading. phenetic comparison of its <dig> base pairs between two taxa can lead to false conclusions when the phylogeny of the organisms is ignored. therefore, it is essential to map cbcs on the phylogenetic tree in order to determine the evolutionary history of the respective base pair, including homoplasious changes. 4) hemi-cbcs do not contribute to cbcs. throughout the its <dig> phylogeny of the ulvales, not a single base pair revealed a cbc that represented a two-fold hcbc event of the pathway u-a ⇔ u-g ⇔ c-g, although the individual hcbc events occurred with high frequencies. as a general conclusion, evolutionary divergences characterized by cbcs are mostly not characterized by hcbc, and vice versa. similarly, its <dig> positions showing cbc-type changes are usually different from base pairs evolving via hcbcs. we conclude that cbcs likely evolved via short-lived non-paired intermediates.

although the conclusions of this study were derived from its <dig> data of only a single group of algae , they may well apply to other eukaryotes. concepts of species delimitation based on presence/absence of cbcs in its <dig> should be applied only after careful analysis of its <dig> evolution and phylogeny.
