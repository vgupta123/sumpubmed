BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  refers to a group of strains capable of causing diseases outside the intestinal tract, including uropathogenic e. coli , sepsis-associated e. coli, and neonatal meningitis-associated e. coli <cit> . among expec strains, upec is the most common cause of human urinary tract infections 
 <cit> . avian pathogenic e. coli  is the main cause of avian colibacillosis, which refers to any localized or systemic infections such as acute fatal septicemia or subacute pericarditis and airsacculitis. apec and upec possess similar virulence factors for colonizing and invading the host, including adhesins, toxins, polysaccharide coatings, protectins, invasins, and iron acquisition systems
 <cit> .

iron is an essential element for survival of e. coli. it facilitates numerous cellular activities, such as peroxide reduction, electron transport, and nucleotide biosynthesis
 <cit> . as iron exists at low concentrations in extraintestinal sites of infection, the expec strains have evolved multiple strategies for sequestering iron from the host.

the direct way is to take up iron from either free heme or from heme-containing proteins, such as hemoglobin or hemopexin. heme is the most abundant iron source in vivo, and the presence of a heme system in expec strains may be important for the acquisition of iron from heme or hemoglobin. specific outer membrane receptors hma and chua bind host hemoproteins and transfer the coordinated heme molecule into the periplasm, where an abc transport system delivers it to the cytoplasm. once taken up by chua and transported across the outer membrane, heme is internalized into the periplasm and then bound by heme-specific periplasmic transport protein chut, which mediates heme transfer to the cytoplasm through an atp-binding cassette  transporter
 <cit> .

the indirect strategy for iron acquisition is based on a shuttle mechanism, which uses small-molecule compounds called siderophores as high-affinity ferric iron chelators
 <cit> , including the catecholates enterobactin, salmochelin, the hydroxamate aerobactin, and yersiniabactin
 <cit> . salmochelin molecules were first discovered in salmonella enterica <cit> . the iroa locus responsible for salmochelin production was also first identified in salmonella spp.
 <cit> . salmochelins are c-glucosylated derivatives of enterobactin, encoded by the irobcden gene cluster
 <cit> . among e. coli isolates, iro sequences have been described in expec strains isolated from patients with neonatal meningitis
 <cit> , utis, and prostatitis in humans
 <cit> , as well as from apec isolates from poultry. compared to enterobactins, salmochelins are superior siderophores in the presence of serum albumin, which may suggest that salmochelins are considerably more important in the pathogenesis of certain e. coli and salmonella infections than enterobactins
 <cit> . in expec strains, the gene cluster responsible for salmochelin biosynthesis and transport is generally found on colv or colbm virulence plasmids, and has also been identified on chromosomal pathogenicity-associated islands  in some strains
 <cit> . the salmochelin gene cluster contains a gene encoding a cytoplasmic esterase, irod. irod can hydrolyze the ester bonds of both enterobactin and salmochelin molecules, which is required for subsequent iron release from salmochelin
 <cit> .

aerobactin is a hydroxamate siderophore produced by most apec strains and other pathogenic e. coli. it is synthesized by the iucabcd-encoded gene products and taken up by the iuta-encoded receptor protein
 <cit> . despite the chemical differences among these distinct siderophores, each system is comprised of components mediating the specific steps required for ferric iron uptake, including siderophore synthesis in the cytoplasm, secretion, reception of the ferri-siderophore at the outer membrane surface, internalization, and iron release in the cytoplasm
 <cit> .

while both apec and upec strains have multiple iron acquisition systems, the role of distinct iron uptake systems in the pathogenesis of both apec and upec has not been illustrated in the same chicken challenge model. in this study, the genes chut, irod and iucd were chosen to assert the roles of heme, salmochelin and aerobactin in the virulence of apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> 

RESULTS
iron acquisition systems in apec e <dig> and upec u17
apec e <dig> belongs to the o <dig> serogroup and b <dig> phylogenetic group, while upec u <dig>  isolated from the urine of a patient, was found to belong to the b <dig> phylogenetic group, but was non-typable by the standard o sera test. previous work in our laboratory has shown that e <dig> and u <dig> share similar virulence gene profiles and that both cause a typical avian colibacillosis, with bacteria invading the air sacs, blood, and pericardial fluid, with typical fibrinous lesions. both strains possess the same iron uptake systems, including heme, enterobactin, salmochelin, aerobactin, and yersiniabactin
 <cit> .

effect of iron acquisition system mutations on chicken virulence
because iron acquisition systems were associated with e. coli isolates from extraintestinal infections, we investigated the importance of distinct iron uptake systems to the virulence of apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> in chickens. in the single-strain challenge model, 5-week-old chickens were inoculated in the left thoracic air sac with wild-type strains or their isogenic mutant derivatives. from the inoculation site, virulent strains can typically invade deeper tissues, generate gross lesions, and cause systemic infection. however, in this model, attenuated strains are impaired in their capacity to colonize deeper tissues. compared to wild-type parent strains, both the mutants e058Δirod and u17Δirod were attenuated, and significantly reduced bacterial numbers were recovered from all internal organs tested: 10– <dig> times lower than those of the wild-type strains  . e058Δiucd showed significantly reduced bacterial numbers in the heart , liver , kidney  , and spleen  . meanwhile, u17Δiucd had significantly decreased bacteria counts in both the liver  and kidney  . the e058Δchut and u17Δchut colony forming units  isolated from the organs of the chickens were similar to those of the wild-type strains  , except for e058Δchut in liver tissue  . challenge with the e058ΔchutΔirodΔiucd and u17ΔchutΔirodΔiucd triple mutants led to greatest reductions in bacterial loads in all the tested internal organs  . to determine whether the defect in the triple mutants was mainly mediated by the salmochelin system, we constructed a complementation plasmid for the triple mutants using the native irod gene. results showed that the recovered colony numbers of ree058tripirod isolated from organs were similar to those of the wild-type strain in liver , spleen , lung  . meanwhile, the recovered cfu of reu17tripirod in heart , liver , spleen , and lung  were similar to those of the wild-type strain .

compared to the single-strain challenge model, the competitive co-infection model using both parent strain and its isogenic mutant can demonstrate more sensitivity to differences in colonization or virulence. in co-infection experiments, both e058Δchut and e058Δiucd did not demonstrate any significant decrease in pathogenicity compared to e <dig> wild-type in organs  , while e058Δirod was highly attenuated and showed a significantly reduced competitive index , with mean decreases of 77–fold, 70-fold, and 37–fold compared to e <dig> in liver , lung  and kidney  , respectively. for u <dig> and its isogenic mutants, u17Δchut demonstrated no significant decreases compared to u <dig> in all internal organs tested  , while u17Δirod cfu counts were highly reduced, with mean decreases of 105-fold, 49-fold, 80-fold, and 46-fold compared to the wild-type strain in liver , spleen , lung , and kidney  , respectively. u17Δiucd showed significantly reduced ci in the heart, with a mean  <dig> -fold decrease compared to u <dig>  , but demonstrated no significant differences in all the other organs . in co-infection assays using the triple mutants, the ΔchutΔirodΔiucd mutants in e <dig> and u <dig> were both significantly more attenuated than each of the single mutants, with average decreases of 147-fold and 196-fold in organs tested  , respectively.

bactericidal effect of specific-pathogen-free  chicken serum on e <dig> and u <dig> and isogenic mutants
the ability of the isogenic mutants defective in iron acquisition systems to survive in spf chicken serum was not affected, as tested by bactericidal assay, indicating that the iron acquisition systems may be unrelated to serum complement resistance.

growth of iron acquisition mutants in iron-rich and iron-restricted medium
all mutants were grown in lb with or without 200 μm  <dig> '-dipyridyl . growth patterns of the mutants were similar to those of the parent strains in both iron-rich and iron-restricted medium .

bacterial invasion and intracellular viability
analysis of the capability of mutants to enter avian macrophages was carried out using an invasion assay in the avian macrophage hd- <dig> cell line. results showed no significant differences between mutant strains and the parent strains e <dig> and u <dig>  with the invasion ratios varying from  <dig> – <dig>  .

to determine whether the iron uptake systems are required for intracellular survival, we compared the cfu of the wild-types and isogenic mutants recovered at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 hours post infection . we observed similar intracellular bacterial proliferation rates, with rates of 62–65% at  <dig> h.p.i., which then decreased to a rate of approximately 50% at  <dig> h.p.i.. rates fell sharply to approximately 10% at  <dig> h.p.i.. the numbers of recovered cfu at  <dig> and  <dig> h.p.i. were below detectable levels. since iron acquisition systems are assumed to be functionally redundant, this may permit intracellular survival in the absence of one or several systems. further, there may be tonb-independent transport systems that could compensate for the mutations in the intracellular environment.

histopathological lesions caused by iron acquisition defective mutants in chickens
histopathological lesions in chickens challenged with virulent wild-type strains or iron acquisition defective mutants were compared. the lesions in the tested organs were graded according to the lesion severity and character . the pathological characteristics of the tested visceral organs from chickens challenged with wild-type strains were as follows. in the heart sections, unequal-sized focal necrotic lesions were present in the disintegrated muscle fibers, and fibrous exudates appeared in the epicardium . the liver sections showed that inflammatory cell infiltrations were present in the hepatic lobule, and numerous small fat granule vacuoles were observed in the cytoplasm . the lung sections revealed numerous inflammatory exudates in the bronchial cavity . however, no obvious pathological lesions were observed in the heart or liver sections of birds challenged with any of the mutant strains, except for the Δchut mutants . the Δchut mutants caused lesions in both the heart and liver of the challenged birds that were equivalent to the wild-type strains. this was in accordance with the results obtained in chicken colonization and persistence assays, from which the chut mutation did not affect the virulence of the wild-type strains .

discussion
apec and upec are the two main subsets of expec bacteria, causing diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract. previous studies have investigated the similarities of apec and upec strains by determining serogroups, virulence genotypes, and assignments to phylogenetic groups
 <cit> . it has been proposed that poultry may be a candidate vehicle for e. coli capable of causing human urinary tract disease, based on the possible transmission of avian e. coli from poultry to humans, and similarities between apec and upec
 <cit> . interestingly, the human upec isolate cft <dig> was shown to be virulent in an avian respiratory infection model, but apec isolates have not yet been found to cause disease in humans
 <cit> . although previous studies have been devoted to the contribution of iron uptake systems to pathogenesis of apec or upec individually, the contribution of these systems to the virulence of apec and upec has not been clarified simultaneously in a chicken challenge model. in this study, the roles of heme, salmochelin and aerobactin systems in the virulence of apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> were assessed. results indicated that the contribution of these three distinct iron acquisition systems to apec e <dig> pathogenesis was quite similar to that of upec u <dig> when assessed simultaneously in chickens. drawing conclusions from this study, chut-mediated heme transport system was generally redundant both in apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> colonization and histopathological lesion formation in chickens. the iucd- mediated aerobactin synthsis played an important role in the pathogenesis of both e <dig> and u <dig>  while the irod-dependent salmochelin system provided a more critical contribution to the virulence of apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> 

heme is the most abundant iron source in vivo, and can be utilized by certain bacterial pathogens. hagan and mobley demonstrated that both chua and hma contribute to cft <dig> heme utilization, while a chua heme receptor mutant was outcompeted by an hma receptor mutant in a murine model of uti, indicating that the chua receptor contributes more to heme uptake in vivo than does hma
 <cit> . bonacorsi et al have presented evidence in support of the role of the chu heme transport system in the virulence of extraintestinal e. coli strains
 <cit> . however, our results showed that chut contributed to a lesser extent to the virulence of apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> in chickens, which implies that the heme internalized in the periplasm may still be transported by other periplasmic binding proteins or by the hma heme transport system, which suppresses the effect of the chut-mediated heme transport defect.

previous research showed that deletion of the iroa locus in apec strain χ <dig> resulted in decreased virulence in chickens
 <cit> . recent studies associated with iro are mainly focused on the iron salmochelin receptor
 <cit> , while the roles of other iro-containing genes in e. coli virulence are seldom reported. irod demonstrated higher affinity for fe3+-loaded siderophores, and efficiently processed cyclic salmochelins and enterobactins into trimers, dimers, and monomers, favoring its role in cytoplasmic release of iron
 <cit> . in this study, irod was chosen to assert the role of salmochelin for expec virulence. chicken pathogenicity assay results showed that deletion of irod in e <dig> and u <dig> led to highly attenuated strains of the respective wild-type strains, implying that the iro iron uptake system plays a critical role in virulence of apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> in chickens. this is in agreement with previous studies by caza et al., showing that the irod hydrolase appeared to play a predominant role in virulence of apec compared to the iroe hydrolase
 <cit> .

when compared to commensal strains, aerobactin biosynthetic genes are more frequently detected in e. coli pathogenic strains, and their incidence correlates with highly pathogenic strains
 <cit> . moreover, compared to the wild-type strain, the virulence of an apec strain deficient in aerobactin synthesis and uptake is reduced in a chicken systemic infection model
 <cit> . similar research showed that both salmochelin and aerobactin appeared to play a significant role in apec virulence
 <cit> . in our study, both e058Δiucd and u17Δiucd showed significantly decreased colonization compared to wild-type strains in several organs in the single-strain challenge model. this suggests that iucd-mediated aerobactin synthesis plays an important role in pathogenesis of apec and upec. however, in the co-infection model, the bacterial loads of the Δiucd mutants in e <dig> and u <dig> were similar to those of the wild-type strains . similarly, an ΔiucbΔentd double mutant, defective in synthesis of both siderophores, was rescued by co-infection with a wild-type strain in the mouse uti model, suggesting that the exogenous siderophores synthesized by the wild-type strain are sufficient to suppress the effect of the siderophore synthesis mutations
 <cit> . in addition, our results showed that the triple mutant ΔchutΔirodΔiucd of e <dig> or u <dig> was more attenuated in the chicken challenge model than each of the single mutants, which further proved that the iron acquisition systems play important roles in the pathogenesis of apec and upec in chickens. complementation of the triple mutants by the native irod gene reinstated the colonization ability of the mutant strains in most of the tested organs, confirming that the pathogenesis defect in the triple mutants is mainly mediated by the salmochelin system.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the data presented here demonstrates that both salmochelin and aerobactin systems appear to play an important role in apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> virulence, while salmochelin contributed more to the virulence. the chut-mediated heme transport system appeared to be redundant. while no differences were observed between the mutants and their wild-type parents in other phenotypic traits tested, suggesting that other virulence mechanisms compensate for the effect of the mutations.
