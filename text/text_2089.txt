BACKGROUND
trypsin-like serine proteases constitute a large family of proteolytic enzymes with diverse functions in vertebrate physiology  <cit> . common to members of this family is a conserved catalytic domain, which contains a ser-asp-his catalytic triad in the active site. all members of this protease family are synthesized as pro-enzymes  with an n-terminal extension that spatially distorts the active site to render the protease catalytically inactive. conversion to the active protease  occurs by removal of the n-terminal extension by a single proteolytic cleavage after an arg or lys residue, which is located within a highly conserved activation cleavage site. removal of this n-terminal extension spatially reorients the catalytic domain to its active conformation  <cit> .

matriptase is a membrane-anchored trypsin-like serine protease that is found in all vertebrates and is expressed in the epithelium of most tissues  <cit> . previous studies have uncovered essential functions of matriptase in key aspects of epithelial biology, including epithelial development, tight junction formation, fluid secretion, and regeneration of damaged epithelium . deregulated matriptase activity has also been linked to growth factor and inflammatory signaling in the context of cancer and other diseases .

matriptase is a modular, approximately 95-kda type ii transmembrane protein that consists of a cytoplasmic n-terminal domain, a signal anchor that serves as a single-pass transmembrane domain, a sea urchin sperm protein, enteropeptidase, agrin domain, two complement c1r/s urchin embryonic growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein- <dig> domains, four low-density lipoprotein receptor class a domains, and a c-terminal trypsin-like serine protease domain  <cit> . zymogen conversion of matriptase occurs by hydrolysis of a specific arg614-val <dig> bond within the amino acid sequence rqar614-vvgg . matriptase zymogen conversion on the surface of epithelial cells is followed by rapid inactivation of the protease by hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor - <dig> and shedding of the protease-inhibitor complex from the cell surface  <cit> .

matriptase is unusual among trypsin-like serine proteases in that the zymogen possesses measurable enzymatic activity. this was first evidenced by the ability of the purified soluble matriptase serine protease domain to undergo auto-activation when incubated for prolonged periods  <cit> . subsequent studies showed that the ability of full-length matriptase to undergo activation site cleavage in cell-based assays was dependent on the integrity of the matriptase catalytic triad  <cit> . a careful biochemical analysis of a soluble zymogen-locked version of matriptase comprising the entire ectodomain of the protease showed that the zymogen displayed 30-fold lower activity than the activated form of the enzyme towards a small peptide substrate that closely resembles the matriptase activation cleavage site sequence  <cit> . this finding led the authors to propose that the principal function of the enzymatic activity of the matriptase zymogen is to facilitate matriptase zymogen conversion. on the other hand, using a cell-based assay, we have recently demonstrated that several zymogen-locked matriptase mutants, but not a catalytically inactive matriptase mutant, are capable of activating prostasin – a validated matriptase substrate  <cit> . these findings give rise to two hypotheses, namely that  the intrinsic activity of the matriptase zymogen serves exclusively to mediate matriptase zymogen conversion and that  the matriptase zymogen is a biologically active molecule capable of cleaving heterologous proteins to execute essential biological functions of the protein.

in this study, we tested these hypotheses by generating transgenic mice expressing matriptase active site and activation cleavage site mutants, and by editing the endogenous matriptase gene . we show that epidermal mis-expression of a zymogen-locked, but not a catalytically inactive, matriptase transgene causes skin pathology similar to that previously observed in transgenic mice expressing wildtype matriptase  <cit> . furthermore, we show that, unlike matriptase null mice, mice engineered to express only zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase complete development have normal postnatal survival, develop epithelial barrier function, and are capable of regenerating damaged epithelium.

RESULTS
zymogen-locked matriptase is biologically active when expressed in basal keratinocytes of transgenic mice
we have previously shown that mis-expression of wildtype matriptase in the basal keratinocyte compartment of transgenic mice causes alopecia and progressive interfollicular hyperplasia through the dual activation of c-met and proteinase activated receptor - <dig> signaling  <cit> . we used this observation to determine if zymogen-locked matriptase displays biological activity in an in vivo setting. specifically, we generated transgenic mice expressing zymogen-locked matriptase by introducing a r614q point mutation in the activation cleavage site, which prevents activation site cleavage required for formation of the substrate binding pocket and alignment of the serine-histidine-aspartic acid triad  <cit> . we also generated transgenic mice expressing catalytically inactive matriptase by introducing a s805a mutation, which replaces the serine of the catalytic serine-histidine-aspartic acid triad. both matriptase mutants were expressed under the control of a keratin- <dig> promoter , which targets expression of linked genes to basal keratinocytes of the interfollicular epidermis and outer root sheath of hair follicles. four founders harboring the k5r614q transgene were obtained by pronuclear injection of zygotes. one founder displayed severe alopecia at the time of weaning and did not transmit the transgene. two founders had noticeable alopecia at the time of weaning, and one founder had no noticeable outward phenotype and a phenotype was also not observed in the f <dig> offspring. four founders harboring the k5s805a transgene were obtained, of which one was nulliparous. the remaining three founders transmitted the transgene to the f <dig> generation. no outwardly observable phenotype was found in any of the four founders or in the f <dig> offspring.fig.  <dig> generation of keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked and keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive transgenic mice. a schematic structure of the keratin-5-matriptase transgenes. the bovine keratin- <dig> promoter , rabbit β-globin exons, rabbit β-globin intron b, mouse matriptase cdna, and rabbit β-globin polyadenylation signal  are shown. b expression of the keratin-5-matriptase transgenes in mouse skin. rt-pcr analysis of skin from an established keratin-5-matriptase zymogen  transgenic mouse line, two wildtype littermates , an established keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive  transgenic mouse line, and two wildtype littermates . c and d quantitative real-time pcr analysis with primer pairs specific for transgenic matriptase mrna  or total matriptase mrna  in skin from newborn wildtype mice , keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked transgenic  littermates, wildtype mice , and keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive transgenic  littermates. horizontal bars are means of individual values. e western blot analysis of total matriptase protein in skin from newborn wildtype mice  and keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked  littermates. quantification of band intensity from scanned western blot from  is shown on the right . f western blot analysis of matriptase in skin from newborn wildtype mice  and keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive  littermates. matriptase null skin was included as negative control . molecular weight markers are shown on the left. quantification of band intensity from scanned western blot from f is shown on the right . p values were determined by student’s t test. additional file 1: raw supporting data




detailed characterization of one established line harboring the r614q matriptase transgene  and one established line harboring the s805a matriptase transgene  showed that they expressed mrna for each of these transgenes in the skin , which resulted in a comparable increase in total skin matriptase mrna . this increase in matriptase mrna resulted in a modest  increase in total skin matriptase protein in the k5r614q transgenic line  and in an approximately five-fold increase in total skin matriptase protein in the k5s805a transgenic line . as expected, immunofluorescence staining of skin from newborn and adult mice showed expression of matriptase in basal keratinocytes of both transgenic lines, which was not detectable in wildtype littermate skin . the specificity of the staining was demonstrated by the absence of staining of matriptase-deficient skin . the two established k5r614q and k5s805a transgenic lines were indistinguishable from wildtype mice at birth and for the first 3– <dig> weeks of life . however, the k5r614q mice developed alopecia of the dorsal and facial skin with a patchy appearance, resulting in areas of skin largely devoid of pelage hair within 6– <dig> months . the progressive alopecia of k5r614q mice was associated with markedly fewer hair follicles , as also observed in transgenic mice expressing wildtype matriptase  <cit> . however, interfollicular hyperplasia, a phenotype associated with transgenic expression of wildtype matriptase, was not observed. in contrast, no phenotype was apparent in k5s805a mice, even when followed for up to 1 year , despite the identical expression pattern and higher level of expression of s805a matriptase protein. taken together, this shows that zymogen-locked matriptase is endowed with biological activity in vivo, that it can elicit one of the phenotypes  elicited by wildtype matriptase when mis-expressed in mouse epidermis, and that the biological activity of zymogen matriptase likely depends on the integrity of the catalytic triad.fig.  <dig> zymogen-locked matriptase is biologically active when expressed in basal keratinocytes of transgenic mice. matriptase protein expression in the skin of newborn wildtype mice  , keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked transgenic mice , keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive mice , matriptase null mice , adult wildtype mice , keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked transgenic mice , and keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive transgenic mice . scale bar = 50 μm, representative for a–g. h–j outward appearance  and histological appearance  of 1-year-old wildtype , keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked , and keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive  mice. scale bar = 500 μm, representative for h–j. k quantification of number of hair follicles/mm in full skin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin from wildtype , keratin-5-matriptase zymogen-locked transgenic , and keratin-5-matriptase catalytically inactive transgenic  mice . expression of zymogen-locked matriptase, but not catalytically inactive matriptase in basal keratinocytes causes alopecia  associated with reduced hair follicle density. additional file 1: raw supporting data




engineering mice expressing zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase
to determine if zymogen-locked matriptase could not only mediate pathological functions of the protease but also perform key physiological functions, we next generated mice expressing only zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase. specifically, we introduced a c.1841– <dig> gc → aa di-nucleotide substitution into exon  <dig> of the st <dig> gene by template-guided repair of a zinc finger nuclease -induced double strand dna break in fvb/nj zygotes . this dinucleotide change generated a mutant st <dig> allele  that encodes a matriptase with arg <dig> substituted by gln, thus rendering the mutant matriptase refractory to activation site cleavage, as shown previously  <cit> . introduction of the dinucleotide change was verified by sequencing analysis of dna from mice bred to homozygosity for the mutated allele . the two base pair substitutions from gc to aa resulted in the elimination of a cac8i restriction endonuclease cleavage site and the generation of a smli restriction endonuclease cleavage site, which allowed for convenient genotyping of mice by pcr amplification of the mutated region, followed by digestion of the amplified dna by either cac8i or smli . for detection of matriptase protein, we used a polyclonal antibody raised against human matriptase, which cross reacts with mouse matriptase and has been used previously to detect the protease in intact mouse tissues and in tissue lysates  <cit> . this antibody recognizes the matriptase serine protease domain, allowing for identification of activated matriptase and matriptase zymogen by sds/page under reducing conditions. preliminary analysis showed that detection of the serine protease domain of activation site-cleaved matriptase in mouse tissues using this antibody by standard sds/page followed by western blot was difficult due to the sensitivity of the antibody. likewise, because prostasin is heterogeneously glycosylated and undergoes c-terminal processing, and because activation site cleavage and reduction of prostasin leads to the removal of just  <dig> amino acids  <cit> , analysis of the state of activation of prostasin proved difficult using standard techniques. we therefore employed the peggy sue capillary electrophoresis system, which separates proteins by size with high resolution and detects them by immunoassay in a sensitive and quantitative format  <cit> , to examine the expression of matriptase and prostasin in the gene-edited mice. to aid the identification of the various forms of prostasin, we included in parallel skin from mice expressing zymogen-locked endogenous prostasin  <cit> . analysis of protein extracts from skin, kidney, lungs, and intestine of newborn st14
zym/zym mice and wildtype  littermates showed that the mutant matriptase was expressed at levels similar to wildtype matriptase . as expected, whereas matriptase from st14
+/+ mice presented in these tissues as a dominant 95 kda band corresponding to zymogen matriptase, and a much less abundant 30 kda band corresponding to activated matriptase  <cit> , only the matriptase zymogen was found in tissues from st14
zym/zym mice . antibody specificity was demonstrated by the absence of these two immunoreactive proteins in the same tissues from st14
–/– mice analyzed in parallel . the same protein extracts were next analyzed for the expression of prostasin . interestingly, prostasin was found in its activation site-cleaved form in the epidermis of both st14
zym/zym mice and st14
+/+ mice , but not in st14
–/– mice , as previously shown  <cit> . skin lysates from prostasin null mice  and prostasin zymogen-locked mice  were used as controls . quantitative analysis of skin extracts  showed that the ratio of activated prostasin to prostasin zymogen was reduced by 48% in newborn st14
zym/zym mice as compared to st14
+/+ mice, whereas active prostasin was undetectable in newborn st14
–/– epidermis. a similar analysis of kidney, lung, and intestine was inconclusive as to the ratio of activated prostasin to prostasin zymogen in these tissues due to insufficient chromatographic separation of the various immunoreactive protein species .fig.  <dig> generation of mice expressing zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase by zfn-mediated gene editing. a structure of donor dna , wildtype st <dig> allele with the zfn binding site , and edited st <dig> allele  containing the base pair substitutions of interest. exons are indicated as gray boxes and introns as black lines. the highlighted part of the donor dna shows the dinucleotide substitution , the zfn binding site , and the synonymous nucleotide changes of the donor dna  to avoid zfn cleavage of the donor dna. the zfn binding site is shown below in capital letters with the zfn cleavage site in red. introduction of the donor dna at the zfn target site results in a c.1841– <dig> gc → aa dinucleotide substitution. b sequence analysis of exon  <dig> from st14

zymogen-locked matriptase supports epithelial development, homeostasis, and regeneration
congenital or conditional matriptase deficiency causes embryonic or postnatal lethality in mice due to the catastrophic loss of barrier function of both simple and multi-layered epithelium  <cit> . to determine if zymogen-locked matriptase can support epithelial development and homeostasis, we next interbred st14
+/zym mice and genotyped  <dig> offspring from a total of  <dig> litters. surprisingly, the epidermis of newborn st14
zym/zym pups was outwardly indistinguishable from st14
+/+ littermates , and the body weight of newborn st14
zym/zym pups was not significantly different from their st14
+/zym and st <dig> littermates . furthermore, st14
zym/zym pups were present at weaning at the expected mendelian frequency . these unexpected findings indicate that matriptase can support postnatal development independent of zymogen conversion. newborn st14
zym/zym skin presented histologically with a mildly compacted, slightly more immature stratum corneum , and was different from the immature compacted stratum corneum of st14

congenital or conditional deletion of matriptase from intestinal epithelial cells of mice causes a catastrophic increase in intestinal barrier permeability, gross disruption of intestinal tissue architecture, failure to thrive, and high mortality  <cit> . in sharp contrast, intestinal tissues from adult st14
zym/zym mice were histologically unremarkable . the expression pattern of zymogen matriptase in the epithelial cells of the intestines was indistinguishable from that of wildtype littermates . direct measurement of barrier permeability in adult st14
zym/zym intestine, as determined by the rate of gavaged fitc-dextran entering the blood stream , was approximately doubled, as compared to st14

we recently reported that normal skin wound healing requires prostasin proteolytic activity, as evidenced by delayed wound healing in mice expressing catalytically inactive prostasin  <cit> . to determine if zymogen-locked matriptase could support this prostasin-dependent repair process, we next generated  <dig> -cm full-thickness incisional skin wounds in the mid-scapular dorsal region of st14
zym/zym mice and their st14
zym/+ and st14
+/+ littermates. the wounds were left unsutured and undressed and were observed daily by an investigator blinded as to mouse genotype. the wounds were scored as healed based on the macroscopic closure of the incision interface and restoration of epithelial covering. interestingly, mice expressing zymogen-locked matriptase were capable of healing their wounds within the same time frame as their wildtype littermates .

abnormal hair follicle development in mice expressing zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase
matriptase is critical for development and maintenance of the hair follicle compartment of mice, as shown by congenital  <cit>  and conditional  <cit>  matriptase ablation, respectively. the fur of adult st14
zym/zym mice was unremarkable . however, pelage hair eruption was slightly delayed in st14
zym/zym pups, as revealed through side-by-side comparison of st14
zym/zym pups and wildtype littermates at days 4– <dig> . likewise, whiskers, which are present in wildtype mice at birth, were absent in newborn st14
zym/zym pups . when they erupted later in postnatal development, the whiskers were often kinked and curly .fig.  <dig> matriptase zymogen conversion is required for normal whisker and pelage hair development. a representative examples of the outward appearance of 1-month-old st14

membrane-anchored prostasin stimulates par- <dig> activation by zymogen-locked matriptase
to further investigate the ability of zymogen-locked matriptase to induce the cleavage of substrates, we used two previously established assays in which the activation of the established matriptase target substrate, par- <dig>  is measured  <cit> . par- <dig> is a g-protein-coupled receptor activated by the proteolytic removal of a short n-terminal peptide by trypsin-like serine proteases. matriptase is a potent activator of par- <dig>  and wildtype prostasin can enhance matriptase-dependent par- <dig> activation  <cit> . the first assay is performed in kolf cells, which are par-1-deficient lung fibroblasts, and takes advantage of a par-2-ap fusion protein from which ap is released after par-2 n-terminal cleavage. in this way, matriptase activity can be quantified by the measurement of ap release to the medium . the second assay detects the amount of activated par- <dig> through the induction of transcription of a serum response element-luciferase reporter plasmid . expression of wildtype prostasin or catalytically inactive prostasin  in kolf cells did not induce par- <dig> cleavage . expression of wildtype matriptase, but not zymogen-locked matriptase, induced par- <dig> cleavage in the absence of prostasin . interestingly, however, zymogen-locked matriptase induced robust cleavage of par- <dig> when co-expressed with wildtype , but not catalytically inactive  prostasin. no increase in par- <dig> cleavage was observed when catalytically inactive matriptase was expressed alone  or was co-expressed with wildtype or catalytically inactive prostasin . unlike par- <dig> cleavage in kolf cells, neither wildtype matriptase nor zymogen-locked matriptase were able to induce significant par-2-dependent serum response element activity when expressed alone . however, both wildtype and zymogen-locked matriptase induced serum response element activity when co-expressed with wildtype , but not catalytically inactive prostasin . the fold induction of par- <dig> activation was less robust in this assay, possibly reflecting different levels of endogenously expressed par-2-activating proteases in the two cell types and/or a high constitutive activity of the serum response element-luciferase reporter gene. catalytically inactive matriptase was unable to induce serum response element activity, whether expressed alone  or in the presence of wildtype  or catalytically inactive  prostasin. in the absence of co-expressed matriptase, neither wildtype  nor catalytically inactive  prostasin induced serum response element activity. similar to wildtype prostasin expressed by transfection, exogenously added soluble prostasin stimulated serum response element activity induced by wildtype matriptase . interestingly, however, unlike transfected wildtype prostasin, soluble prostasin was unable to induce serum response element activity in the presence of zymogen-locked matriptase . catalytically inactive matriptase did not induce serum response element activity when expressed alone  or in the presence of soluble prostasin , and soluble prostasin by itself did not induce serum response element activity . the ability of catalytically active prostasin, but not catalytically inactive prostasin, to promote zymogen-locked matriptase-dependent par- <dig> activation may indicate that prostasin, when activated by zymogen-locked matriptase, executes the activation site cleavage of par- <dig> or that the intrinsic activity of the matriptase zymogen is stimulated more effectively by catalytically active prostasin. taken together, these data show that the matriptase zymogen can induce par- <dig> activation in the presence of prostasin, and that prostasin must be catalytically active and membrane-anchored to facilitate matriptase zymogen activation

discussion
the matriptase-prostasin system was originally proposed to be a simple cascade in which matriptase activated prostasin to execute the biologic functions of the system  <cit> . indeed, phenotypic characterization of mice with congenital matriptase deficiency  <cit> , conditional matriptase deficiency  <cit> , matriptase hypomorphic mice  <cit> , mice with congenital prostasin deficiency  <cit> , conditional prostasin deficiency  <cit> , prostasin hypomorphic mice and rats  <cit> , mice expressing zymogen-locked endogenous prostasin  <cit> , and mice expressing catalytically inactive prostasin  <cit>  supports that this may indeed be the case in at least one organ – the hair follicle, which requires both the expression, zymogen conversion, and full activity of each of the two proteases for normal function. however, studies of these genetically modified animals and complementary cell-based studies have also revealed that the functional interactions between matriptase and prostasin, as well as their individual functions in other tissues, are much more complex and still incompletely understood. thus, the simple linearity of the protease cascade was challenged by the ability of prostasin to efficiently activate matriptase on the surface of cultured cells  <cit> , and by genetic epistasis analysis placing prostasin as either upstream  <cit>  or downstream of matriptase  <cit> , depending on the specific context. more detailed cell-based analysis has partially reconciled these contradictory findings by showing that matriptase and prostasin are capable of forming a reciprocal zymogen activation complex stimulating the conversion of both the matriptase and the prostasin zymogens  <cit> . even more unexpectedly, many biological functions of prostasin were recently shown to be independent of both prostasin zymogen conversion and prostasin catalytic activity  <cit> , although, paradoxically, even catalytically inactive prostasin requires strict developmental regulation by cognate serine protease inhibitors  <cit> .

the current study uncovers additional complexity of the matriptase-prostasin system by showing that matriptase zymogen conversion is dispensable for key functions of the protease in epithelial development and function in mice. this capacity of a serine protease zymogen being able to execute essential proteolytic functions in vivo in the absence of zymogen conversion is rare, and to our knowledge, has only been unequivocally demonstrated for vampire bat plasminogen activator  <cit> . in this regard, it is worthwhile noting that activated matriptase is rapidly inhibited by hai- <dig> in epithelial cells, and the ratio of matriptase zymogen to activated, inhibitor-free matriptase is likely to be high  <cit> . it follows that the majority of available matriptase proteolytic activity on the cell surface may well originate from the zymogen, despite its lower rate of substrate catalysis. in support of this, data presented in this paper show that zymogen-locked matriptase, in the presence of hai- <dig>  which inhibits activated matriptase but not zymogen-locked matriptase, induces prostasin-dependent par- <dig> activation as efficiently as wildtype matriptase in a cell-based assay. aligned with this, we found that zymogen-locked matriptase retains the ability to stimulate epidermal prostasin zymogen conversion in vivo, and that mice expressing zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase retain the ability to regenerate epidermis, a process recently shown to involve prostasin proteolytic activity  <cit> . additional evidence for the engagement of the matriptase zymogen in cell surface proteolysis is provided by the curious observation that active site inhibitors of matriptase, including small molecule inhibitors and an antibody-based inhibitor, were either ineffective or needed concentrations of inhibitor that were multiple orders of magnitude higher than the ki of the inhibitor for the activated matriptase serine protease domain to inhibit matriptase-dependent proteolysis on the cell surface  <cit> .

it still needs to be shown how the current findings translate to human matriptase. like rodent matriptase , the human matriptase zymogen is endowed with considerable enzymatic activity, as determined by the capacity of the soluble recombinant serine protease domain to auto-activate  <cit> , the capacity of full length human matriptase zymogen to incorporate an activity-based probe in a cell-based assay  <cit> , and the dependence of the matriptase catalytic triad for human matriptase to undergo activation site cleavage in cell-based assays  <cit> .

in the hair follicle and, likely, the interfollicular epidermis, matriptase and prostasin may co-localize constitutively on the plasma membrane  <cit> . however, in most polarized epithelia and epithelial cells, matriptase is confined to the basolateral membrane and prostasin to the apical membrane  <cit> , although prostasin appears to be required for matriptase zymogen conversion even in polarized epithelia  <cit> . it has been proposed that matriptase and prostasin are brought together in polarized epithelia to facilitate mutual zymogen conversion only after disruption of homeostasis and loss of tight junction function  <cit> . while this may indeed represent a major pathway for activation of the matriptase-prostasin system during epithelial restoration  <cit> , matriptase and prostasin are required not only for epithelial restoration, but also for normal homeostatic functions of many polarized epithelia . the current study, when combined with our recent studies of mice expressing zymogen-locked and catalytically inactive endogenous prostasin, now indicate that epithelial homeostasis may be maintained largely independent of conversion of either the matriptase zymogen or the prostasin zymogen. alternatively, a polarized epithelium at homeostasis may display low levels of activated matriptase and prostasin due to the curious routing of prostasin to the basolateral membrane prior to its final delivery to the apical membrane  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, using gain and loss of function genetics in mice, we have found that the matriptase zymogen is a biologically active molecule that sustains epithelial development and homeostasis, and can cause pathology when mis-expressed. this finding advances our mechanistic understanding of matriptase and has important implications for the development of strategies for therapeutic targeting of this membrane-anchored protease in inflammatory, proliferative, and degenerative diseases.
