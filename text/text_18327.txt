BACKGROUND
in mammals, blood glucose homeostasis is subjected to a tight endocrine control relying notably on insulin-producing beta cells from the pancreas. beta cells secrete insulin in response to increased glucose concentrations and to hormones released from gut cells, like glucagon-like peptide- <dig> . in longer term, these physiological signals also control insulin production, stimuli-responsiveness and beta cell mass  <cit> . over the years, this regulation helps the organism maintaining glucose homeostasis, accommodating changes in diet and insulin demand. deficient adaptation may lead to diabetes  <cit> .

long term adaptation of beta cell is associated with changes in gene transcription. several glucose-regulated genes have been identified which are likely involved in the chronic effects of glucose on beta cell mass and function  <cit> . some of these genes are immediate-early response genes  rapidly induced upon acute beta cell stimulation with glucose and other stimuli  <cit> .

iegs are defined as genes which transcription is regulated without the need for protein de novo synthesis. induction of ieg transcription is triggered by intracellular signals which activate constitutively expressed transcription factors acting on ieg promoters  <cit> . in beta cells, the mechanisms leading to the induction of iegs by glucose and glp- <dig> were shown to involve generation of camp, as well as cell depolarization and subsequent ca2+ signaling, resulting in activation of calmodulin-dependent kinase iv, protein kinase a and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  these kinases lead to phosphorylation and activation of several transcription factors, like camp-responsive element binding protein, serum response factor, and elk- <dig>  <cit> . these mechanisms occur rapidly and result, within minutes, in transcriptional regulation of iegs. such direct and rapid mechanisms do not however permit to understand regulation of genes for which expression levels change later and over much longer time frames , and which are likely relevant for the long term adaptation of beta cell. other types of mechanisms must be taken into account.

the best studied iegs in beta cells  code for transcription factors  <cit> . it has been proposed that these transcription factors will in turn regulate the transcription of downstream target genes . the distinction can thus be made between two modes of transcriptional regulation:  direct regulation, which is independent of protein synthesis , and  indirect regulation, which requires preliminary ieg induction . a cascade of gene induction, involving upstream iegs and downstream targets, represents an attractive model to explain how beta cell can bridge the time gap between relatively short-lived stimuli and long term cellular adaptation of gene expression.  <cit> 

the aims of the study were, first, to identify targets at a large scale in order to evaluate the importance of indirect regulation of gene transcription, second, to define the cellular functions concerned, and third, to verify the regulatory link between specific ieg transcription factors and targets.

we have designed a genome-scaled approach to identify glucose and camp-induced iegs and their targets. database annotation searches were applied to infer cellular functions of these genes. in silico analysis of target gene promoters as well as gain and loss of function experiments were performed to establish the link between specific iegs and target gene induction.

the data reported here suggest that a large part of gene expression induced upon beta cell stimulation is regulated by indirect mechanisms requiring preliminary ieg induction. functions attributed to gene products cover a large spectrum of cellular processes for both ieg and targets, including metabolism, secretion, control of cell growth, signal transduction and regulation of transcription.

RESULTS
identification and validation of glucose- and camp-regulated iegs and targets
to identify genes regulated by metabolic signals in beta cells, we stimulated min <dig> insulin-secreting cells with a combination of elevated glucose  and chlorophenylthio-camp , a membrane-permeant camp analogue. indeed, glucose induction of gene expression is potentiated by gut hormones  which raise camp  <cit> . our initial transcript profile comparison using high density oligonucleotide microarrays identified genes regulated by a  <dig> hour treatment with glucose and cpt-camp . comparison with profiles obtained in presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide  allowed classifying each stimuli-responsive gene either as ieg or as target. indeed, by blocking protein neosynthesis, chx blocks synthesis of ieg products and their downstream regulatory action on target transcription. thus, among the stimuli-responsive genes, those still regulated in presence of chx were defined as iegs, while those no longer regulated were defined as targets .

among the  <dig> regulated genes,  <dig> target genes were identified . thus, a substantial part of the impact produced by metabolic signals on beta cell transcriptional program rely on the indirect action of ieg products.

                              targets
to validate microarray data, we performed quantitative rt-pcr analysis for a selected set of iegs and target genes. comparison between fold-change values obtained from microarray or rt-pcr experiments revealed that the microarray data were of excellent quality . furthermore, the chx effect was confirmed by rt-pcr. indeed, target regulation by glucose and camp was abrogated in presence of chx . furthermore, despite a small effect of chx by itself on all glucose-inducible iegs examined, these were as strongly stimulated by glucose and camp in the presence of chx as in its absence . thus rt-pcr data validate the selection of targets and iegs based on the microarray data.

functional classification of iegs and targets
to address the functional role of iegs and targets regulated by glucose and camp in beta cells, we classified them into functional categories based on the annotations in the swiss-prot database   <cit> . of  <dig> glucose regulated genes with annotations, more than  <dig> are involved in signaling and transcription regulation. the large number of iegs involved in these two processes suggests the importance of indirect mechanisms in gene regulation. moreover, an important fraction of target genes are themselves involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation.

other important functional clusters include genes involved in the secretory pathway, the metabolism or the control of cell mass; processes that are known to be regulated by glucose in beta cells  <cit> . thus, the response of our min <dig> model is in agreement with previous knowledge on the effect of metabolic stimuli on gene expression in beta cells. the genes involved in the secretory pathway concerned with protein synthesis, translocation and folding in the er, glycosylation, vesicule transport, and exocytosis, are detailed in the additional file  <dig>  interestingly, an important cluster of down-regulated genes is involved in dna damage checkpoint/repair pathways.

noteworthy, the roles of ieg products are not restricted to transcriptional regulation and cover a large panel of functions . thus, while on the one hand, some iegs can act indirectly by regulating expression of target genes, on the other hand, different iegs can contribute directly to the functional adaptation of beta cell to metabolic stimulation.

target promoter analysis reveals the importance of ap- <dig> transcription factor
to establish the link between iegs that encode transcription factors and their targets, we analyzed the promoters of target genes. predicted regulatory elements in target gene promoters as well as in control sets of promoter  were gathered using the tfexplorer database  <cit> . we then evaluated over- and under-represented regulatory elements in targets promoters compared to control sets.  <dig> regulatory elements binding specific transcription factors were significantly over-represented in glucose-responsive target gene promoters . these include notably binding sites for e2f and dp- <dig> transcription factors found both in up-regulated and down-regulated targets. but the most markedly over-represented regulatory element was an ap- <dig> binding site which was present in 14% of the up-regulated targets . interestingly, this binding sequence was not enriched in down-regulated targets. this suggests an important role for ap- <dig> in transcriptional activation of target, and prompted us to investigate its regulation in more details.

glucose and camp regulate ap- <dig> complex composition and function
ap- <dig> binds dna as a dimer composed of proteins of the fos and jun families; forming either a jun/jun homo-dimer or a fos/jun hetero-dimer  <cit> . min <dig> cells maintained at low glucose predominantly expressed c-jun and jund, indicating that the ap- <dig> complex is likely composed of jun/jun homo-dimer . elevated glucose and camp produced a robust  <dig> fold increase in c-fos and fosb , while c-jun and jund expression was slightly inhibited . these results suggest a potential shift in the composition of the ap- <dig> complex toward fos/jun hetero-dimer and consequently a possible alteration of ap- <dig> transactivating activity. to test this possibility, we transfected cells with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an artificial promoter harboring solely ap- <dig> sites as enhancers . cells maintained at low glucose expressed the reporter constitutively, likely reflecting the transcriptional activation by the constitutive  ap- <dig> factors. despite this relatively high basal level of expression, glucose and camp still further stimulated the ap- <dig> reporter expression significantly .

* significantly and consistently regulated iegs

further experiments were performed to determine whether the increased transcriptional activation by ap- <dig> could be explained by the induction of fos genes. min <dig> cells were co-transfected with pap-1-luc and expression vectors for c-fos and c-jun. at constant levels of the c-jun vector, increasing amounts of transfected c-fos vector led to a gradual increase in reporter gene expression . consistently, fos/jun hetero-dimers transactivate more efficiently than jun/jun homo-dimers . thus, the accumulation of c-fos gene product is sufficient to enhance transcription of ap- <dig> regulated genes.

in addition, we used a-fos  to block endogenous ap- <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . results demonstrate that endogenous ap- <dig> mediates the transcriptional activation of the ap- <dig> reporter during stimulation with glucose and camp . as control, we used a-c/ebp  which did not alter ap- <dig> reporter transcription neither in basal nor in stimulated conditions.

we then determined if the transcriptional induction of endogenous c-fos by glucose and camp would effectively change the composition of dna binding ap- <dig> complex. min <dig> cells were stimulated with glucose and glucagon-like peptide- <dig> , a physiologically active glucoincretin hormone which raises camp in beta cells  <cit> . upon stimulation, c-fos mrna induction was followed by a marked increase in nuclear c-fos protein, as seen by western blot analysis of nuclear extracts , as well as by immunocytochemistry . as a result, glucose-induced fos protein formed functional ap- <dig> complexes . this was shown by elisa quantification of the components of ap- <dig> complexes binding to solid phase linked double stranded dna with the specific ap- <dig> consensus sequence. the strong correlation between accumulation of fos in nuclear extracts and its dna binding activity indicates that newly synthesized fos protein is efficiently recruited to dna-binding ap- <dig> complexes . in contrast to c-fos, and accordingly to a constant level of expression, jund in functional ap- <dig> complexes remained unchanged .

the data in figure  <dig> show that after glucose and camp induction of fos- and jun-like iegs, the newly synthesized components are recruited to dna binding ap- <dig> complexes, notably shifting their composition to fos/jun hetero-dimers which are more potent trans-activators than the constitutive jun/jun homo-dimers. qualitative and quantitative changes in the ap- <dig> complex may explain the increased expression of a large number  of glucose up-regulated target genes. this mechanism involves transcriptional induction of ieg and illustrates how iegs and their downstream targets are linked.

ap- <dig> regulates the transcription of the target gene sulfiredoxin 
having demonstrated that glucose and camp can activate ap- <dig> transcription factor, we pursued our investigations to identify which specific targets are effectively regulated by ap- <dig>  a candidate approach was undertaken. the most strongly induced target gene in our system was sulfiredoxin  and we identified three predicted ap- <dig> sites in its promoter; located  <dig>  respectively  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs  upstream of the transcriptional start site. srxn <dig> promoter regions from different sizes were then cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene and these constructs were transfected in min <dig> cells. results of this approach show that a narrow region of  <dig> bp containing the three ap- <dig> sites is both sufficient and necessary to srxn <dig> gene transcription in basal and stimulated conditions . co-transfection with the a-fos dominant negative form of ap- <dig> impaired basal level of srxn <dig> reporter transcription and abolished stimuli responsiveness, indicating that ap- <dig> was necessary for these effects . in addition, ectopic expression of c-fos was sufficient to stimulate srxn <dig> reporter transcription .

finally, we established stably transfected min <dig> cell lines expressing a-fos as well as control constructs. the down regulation of ap- <dig> function in these stable clones was confirmed by assessing the transcriptional activation of a transiently transfected pap-1-luc reporter . the expression levels of endogenous srxn <dig> was then evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr . while jund mrna levels  were constant among the different clones, both basal and stimulated srxn <dig> mrna levels were reduced in a-fos clones. these effects were not due to a defective stimuli-responsiveness in a-fos clones since egr- <dig> ieg responded normally. in conclusion, data in figure  <dig> show that srxn <dig> is a downstream transcriptional target of ap- <dig> 

ap- <dig> and its target srnx <dig> are regulated by metabolic stimuli in primary pancreatic islets
because some aspects of signaling in cell lines  may be altered by the transformation or the long term maintenance in culture, we evaluated if our results could be consistently reproduced in primary cells from isolated islets.

firstly, we evaluated the effects of metabolic stimuli on expression of several ieg mrna in isolated rat primary islets . glucose synergized with cpt-camp or with glp- <dig> to induce c-fos, fra- <dig>  fra- <dig> and junb, while c-jun and jund remained unaffected by these stimuli . the pattern is identical to what was observed in min <dig> . furthermore, we observed induction of egr- <dig> and nur <dig> , indicating that the parallel between min <dig> and primary islets is not limited to ap- <dig>  interestingly, dose-dependency experiments indicated that maximal stimulation of iegs was reached in presence of glp- <dig> and within a physiological  range of glucose concentrations . noteworthy, we obtained similar synergistic activation of iegs with isolated  beta cells stimulated with glucose and glp- <dig> , respectively glucose and cpt-camp . without excluding induction of iegs in other islet cell types , these data indicate that ieg mrna accumulates in response to metabolic stimuli in primary pancreatic beta cells.

secondly, we investigated whether changes in ieg mrna levels were effectively followed by changes in protein levels. c-fos expression was thus assessed by immunocytochemistry in dispersed islets  and by western blot analysis in nuclear extracts prepared from intact islets . under low glucose conditions, immunofluorescence staining of dispersed islets produced only a faint background signal for c-fos. upon co-stimulation by glucose and glp- <dig> or cpt-camp, expression of c-fos became strongly apparent. c-fos protein was mainly detected in nuclei, co-localizing with dapi staining for dna. co-staining for insulin showed that nuclear c-fos protein was found in beta cells. western blot analysis confirmed the accumulation of c-fos protein in the nucleus of primary islet cells. as depicted in figure 8b, c-fos protein levels were nearly undetectable in islets maintained at low glucose concentrations. within  <dig> minutes of stimulation by glp- <dig> and elevated glucose, c-fos became prominently present in the nuclear extracts. using cpt-camp as co-stimulator with glucose led to a further increase in the c-fos signal on the western blots. quantitatively, these data on nuclear c-fos protein corroborate observations made at the mrna level, with a strong effect of cpt-camp and a more moderate effect of glp- <dig> , and are similar to observations made in min <dig> cells .

thirdly, we evaluated whether ap- <dig> regulation by metabolic stimuli could be functional in islets. to that purpose, expression levels of the newly identified ap- <dig> target gene srxn <dig> were quantified by rt-pcr in isolated rat islets. as in min <dig> cells, co-stimulation with glucose and cpt-camp, or glucose and glp- <dig>  induced significant accumulation of srxn <dig> mrna .

altogether, data in figures  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show that a functional ap- <dig> regulation occurs in primary beta cells in response to metabolic stimuli. this shows the potential physiological relevance of the observations made in min <dig>  and emphasizes the interest of the dataset obtained with our screening approach in this cell line model.

discussion
the present study provides a comprehensive view on the changes in gene transcription that occur within the first hours after pancreatic beta cell stimulation with glucose plus camp or incretin hormones. induced iegs and their downstream targets were identified on a genomic scale. both iegs and targets code for proteins involved in a large spectrum of cellular functions, including those tightly related to beta cell physiology, suggesting that these inductions may mediate long term cellular adaptation. statistics on the response elements in target promoters pointed towards a predominant role of ap- <dig> composed of ieg products of the fos and jun families. the mediator role of ap- <dig> for the induction of a newly identified specific target  was substantiated by expressing loss- and gain-of-function mutants of c-fos.

indirect mechanisms of gene regulation
the metabolic state of a pancreatic beta cell is translated readily and without delay into insulin secretion which is adjusted within minutes to altered glucose stimulation. such direct translation of metabolic state into regulated expression is not possible for genes which change their expression over much longer time frames . the transcriptional regulation of iegs coding for transcription factors according to beta cell metabolic activity provides a mechanism by which target gene transcription can be controlled over longer time frames. increasing or decreasing the presence of such transcription factors on the promoters of target gene will affect the rate of transcription. here we illustrate this mechanism with the ap- <dig> transcription factor, the importance of which is indicated by the over-representation of ap- <dig> binding sites in up-regulated target promoters. by modulating the pattern of expression of the different ap- <dig> complex components , glucose and camp shift the composition of ap- <dig> dimer. the transcriptional induction of c-fos by glucose and camp relies on the activation of camkinase ii and pka which converge to regulate cis-elements in its promoter ; in addition insulin signaling may also be involved, as reported in other cell systems . the shift in ap- <dig> composition increases transcriptional activation of an ap- <dig> reporter gene, as well as at least one endogenous ap- <dig> target , showing that it has the potential to affect numerous genes with an ap- <dig> binding sequence in their promoters. furthermore, the shift in ap- <dig> composition , as well as the up-regulation of srnx <dig> are observed in cultured intact islets. together with the observation of iegs induction in vivo  <cit> , this illustrates the physiological relevance of our observations in the min <dig> cell line.

the ap- <dig> example illustrate the complexity of indirect regulation, since this transcription factor exists in many combinations of jun and fos like proteins, some of which are constitutive and some of which can be post-translationally modified. this gives rise to a whole repertoire of ap- <dig> complexes with differential selectivity for distinct ap- <dig> binding sites, varying trans-activation potential, and differential interactions with other transcription factors acting on the same promoter  <cit> .

it should be mentioned that transcriptional activation, as proposed here with the example of ap- <dig>  is not the only possible mechanism able to explain changes in mrna levels ; ieg products regulating target mrna levels may also be proteins involved in the control of mrna degradation or in the upstream signaling pathways that modulate the activity of transcription factors and regulators of mrna stability.

limitations
iegs are defined as genes induced without the need for protein de novo synthesis. iegs are thus identified with the use of protein synthesis inhibitors like chx .

results obtained with chx have to be considered with some caution. in addition to blocking protein synthesis, chx may also affect rna and protein stability as well as signaling pathways  <cit> . design and interpretation of our microarray experiments aimed to reduce the impact of the non-specific effects of chx to a minimum. we considered in our gene lists only those genes which responded to stimulation when tested in the absence of chx; thus, chx data were only used to separate iegs from targets within the list of stimuli-responsive genes. furthermore, in the experiments where cells were stimulated in the presence of chx, induction was assessed against the chx control conditions. therefore, in our analysis, side effects of chx could have caused mis-labeling of responding genes as iegs or targets under very particular circumstances. as these appear relatively unlikely, we are confident that the large majority of genes are correctly listed. indeed, the detailed induction kinetic of several iegs and targets genes selected from these lists show distinct temporal patterns of induction; the induction of all targets  was delayed compared to the rapid induction of the iegs   <cit> . moreover, in the present study, we were able to verify the predictions about ap- <dig> based on the in silico target gene promoter analysis. hence, in spite of the limitations linked to using chx, our microarray data represent a valid starting point to further advance our understanding of the transcriptional response of beta cells to metabolic signals.

the cellular function of glucose and camp regulated genes
glucose and camp responsive genes form large clusters functionally involved in secretion, metabolism, and beta cell mass control . regulation according to the metabolic state of such specific pancreatic beta cell functions is in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . however, a completely novel and unexpected finding is that genes involved in dna damage checkpoint/repair represent a large down-regulated cluster. this is consistent with the down-regulation of key transcription factors governing this pathway  and some downstream apoptosis effectors like bbc <dig>  also known as puma   <cit> . this raises intriguing questions about the possible implication of dna damage pathway in the control of beta cell survival by glucose and will require further investigations.

srxn <dig> gene product sulfiredoxin reactivates peroxiredoxins  by catalyzing the reduction of sulfinic acids formed on peroxiredoxins following exposure to excessive levels of h2o <dig>  <cit> . recently, sulfiredoxin was also shown to be involved in the reversal of protein glutathionylation  <cit> . thus, sulfiredoxin is emerging as an important component in the cellular redox signaling/control systems. to our knowledge, our study provides the first report on the mechanisms of srxn <dig> gene transcriptional regulation in mammals. regulating the amount of sulfiredoxin in function of cell metabolic stimulation  constitutes a feedback response susceptible to attenuate h2o <dig> effects and signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study sheds light on the mechanisms by which beta cell adapts its transcriptional program in response to metabolic and hormonal stimuli known to control secretion of insulin in the short term and proliferation, cell survival, and responsiveness in the long term. our findings on the role of the ap- <dig> transcription factor as a mediator for the induction of srxn <dig>  illustrate that ieg transcription factors may effectively relay metabolic signals to regulate transcription of target genes in beta cells.

the large number of induced target genes and the wide array of cellular functions concerned suggest that indirect mechanisms of gene regulation  likely play a substantial role in beta cell adaptation. however, the observation that a significant portion of iegs codes for proteins that are directly involved in adapted cellular functions shows that direct induction of iegs transcription complements the indirect mode of gene regulation .
