BACKGROUND
astaxanthin is a carotenoid with high commercial and biotechnological interest, principally reflecting the antioxidant properties of this organic molecule  <cit> . this pigment has been used in aquaculture, food, and cosmetics, and has been evaluated in the pharmaceutical industry  <cit> . in nature, the microalgae haematococcus pluvialis and the yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous are the primary producers of astaxanthin  <cit> , but the natural production of this pigment does not compete with the chemically synthesized pigment. however, many efforts have intensely focused on increasing astaxanthin production through genetic engineering and the optimization of fermentation conditions  <cit> .

x. dendrorhous requires the precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate , generated via the mevalonate  pathway, for astaxanthin biosynthesis. five enzymatic activities are performed in this pathway, and the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coa reductase  is a crucial regulator of these processes  <cit> . subsequently, ipp is condensed through prenyltransferases with different chain length specificities  <cit> . geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate   is an immediate precursor of c <dig> and c <dig> carotenoids, and ggpp synthase  catalyzes the formation of ggpp. phytoene is the first carotenoid produced, from the condensation of two molecules of ggpp, a process catalyzed through the bifunctional enzyme phytoene-lycopene synthase  <cit> . next, phytoene desaturase performs four successive desaturations to generate lycopene. the cyclization of lycopene through phytoene-lycopene synthase produces β-carotene  <cit> . subsequently, β-carotene is oxidized at both ends through the cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, astaxanthin synthase  <cit> . this reaction requires the accessory activity of cytochrome p <dig> reductase  as an electron donor  <cit> . however, although astaxanthin biosynthesis has been elucidated at genetic level, the complex regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain unknown.

in x. dendrorhous, it has been proposed that astaxanthin fulfills a cellular defense role against oxidative damage; indeed, the pigment production is induced through the generation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . moreover, among others factors, the carbon source and oxygen level can influence the amount of pigment synthesized  <cit> . indeed, astaxanthin production increases under aerobic metabolism and decreases during fermentative growth  <cit> . in x. dendrorhous, carotenogenesis is growth-associated and depends on the growth conditions, such as the carbon source  <cit> . notably, carotenogenesis is induced at the beginning of the stationary growth phase when the yeast is cultured in glucose-supplemented medium. in contrast, when succinate is used as the carbon source, the carotenogenesis is induced early during the exponential growth phase  <cit> . additionally, x. dendrorhous carotenoid production is increased when cultured using a non-fermentable carbon source, such as succinate or ethanol  <cit> .

these observations might reflect the transcriptional control of carotenogenesis in glucose medium, but this mechanism is not applicable for growth in succinate medium because there is not a direct association between carotenogenesis induction and the maximum expression levels of carotenogenic genes  <cit> . this behavior suggests the existence of additional carotenogenic regulatory mechanisms associated with growth, likely at the enzymatic level.

in the present study we integrated metabolic profiling and the protein abundance data to examine the influence of fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources  on yeast and we identified the metabolites and proteins associated with the carotenogenesis. to this end, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  coupled with matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry , were employed for protein and metabolite determination, respectively.

RESULTS
growth and carotenoid production in glucose- and succinate- supplemented media
in a previous study, we determined that carotenogenesis in x. dendrorhous is favored when the yeast is cultured in succinate than in other non-fermentable carbon sources, such as xylose or sodium acetate  <cit> . to compare the effect of fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources, the x. dendrorhous ucd 67– <dig> strain was cultured in minimal medium  supplemented with 2% of glucose or succinate. to obtain cellular extracts for all experiments, the cells were harvested from cultures at lag, early exponential, late exponential and stationary growth phases .figure  <dig> growth and carotenoid production during the growth cycle in xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. the ucd 67– <dig> strain was grown in mm supplemented with 2% of glucose  or succinate .  represents the percentage of growth. the maximum absorbance  value was considered as 100% of growth and the value for each time point, was calculated as a percentage of maximum growth. the means ± sd of the values obtained from three independent cultures are shown. the vertical arrows indicate the harvest times for the assays .  represents the total carotenoids.  indicates the induction of carotenoid biosynthesis.



consistent with the previous study  <cit> , the carotenoids content when the yeast was cultured in succinate was 350 μg/g , which is more than twice the value obtained when cultured in glucose-supplemented medium  . using reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography , we determined that astaxanthin is the major carotenoid produced under both culture conditions, with no significant differences in composition . thus, in succinate medium, x. dendrorhous astaxanthin production is enhanced.

additionally, in glucose-supplemented medium, carotenogenesis was induced at the beginning of the stationary growth phase, whereas in succinate, this process was induced earlier during the exponential growth phase  and steadily increased until the stationary phase. this result indicates that carotenogenesis is associated with growth in succinate  <cit> .

x. dendrorhous proteome in fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources
for the proteomics analyses, triplicate protein extracts from yeast grown at each growth phase  were subjected to 2-de, and the protein profiles were analyzed using pdquest software . student’s t-test  was used to identify significant changes in protein abundance. to control for the false discovery rate , defined as the expected proportion of false positives among the proteins with significant abundance changes, we applied the benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction .

in general, the protein profile did not show major differences between either carbon sources at different stages of growth . approximately  <dig>  protein spots were extracted from the gels and identified using maldi-tof ms. in total,  <dig> spots were identified by peptide mass fingerprint , corresponding to  <dig> non-redundant proteins . notably,  <dig> proteins were identified in multiple spots, likely representing protein isoforms due to post-translational modifications.

the identified proteins were classified according to biological functions . approximately 60% of the proteins were associated with central metabolism including amino acids, carbohydrates and redox proteins, which were the most abundant.

student’s t-tests with benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction  were applied to identify significant differences in the intensity of the proteins spots. first, the protein abundance in the early exponential, late exponential and stationary phases of growth relative to the lag phase was evaluated in cultures under each carbon source. in glucose medium,  <dig> proteins with differential abundance were identified . notably, several proteins showed high abundance during the late exponential phase, corresponding to carotenogenesis induction in glucose medium. for example, the phosphoglucomutase protein  exhibited a 3-fold higher intensity during the late exponential phase relative to the intensity observed during the lag phase. among the redox proteins, the monooxygenase , mn-superoxide dismutase   and cytochrome p <dig> protein , showed similar patterns . in addition, the carotenogenic enzymes diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase  and phytoene squalene synthase  also showed similar patterns. however, the abundance profile of some carotenogenic enzymes, like mevalonate kinase , phosphomevalonate kinase and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, did not correspond to any sequential enzymatic function within the carotenogenic pathway. these last three enzymes are not exclusively carotenogenic as they belong to the mva pathway, which also provides metabolite precursors to other pathways  <cit> .

in contrast,  <dig> proteins exhibited differential abundance during the analyzed phases of growth when cultured in succinate . unlike the patterns observed in glucose-supplemented cultures, a high abundance of several proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism were observed during carotenogenesis induction in succinate corresponding to the early exponential growth phase. for example, some tricarboxylic acid cycle  and glycolysis enzymes such as the citrate synthase , succinyl-coa synthase , succinate dehydrogenase , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase   and phosphoglucomutase . a total of  <dig> redox proteins, monooxygenase , cytochrome p <dig>  and thioredoxin  were highly abundant during carotenogenesis induction. among carotenogenic proteins, astaxanthin synthase , mk , and ggps  were highly abundant during the early exponential phase. similar to the patterns observed in glucose cultures, these carotenogenic proteins did not show a sequential abundance profile.

when the proteins patterns obtained from both carbon sources were compared at the same growth stage,  <dig> proteins showed significant abundance differences . in the carbohydrate group, most of the enzymes associated with glycolysis , phosphoglycerate kinase  and pyruvate dehydrogenase ) and the pentose phosphate  pathway  and transaldolase ) were more abundant in glucose. however, the enzymes associated with the tca cycle , succinate dehydrogenase , succinyl-coa synthase  and malate dehydrogenase ) and lipid metabolism  and acyl-coa synthase ) showed higher abundance in succinate. for the redox group, the increased abundance of monooxygenase , dehydrogenase sdr , glutathione-disulfide reductase , and oxidoreductase  were observed in succinate cultures. in the same group, thioredoxin peroxidase  <dig>  , alcohol dehydrogenase   and mnsod  proteins were more abundant in glucose medium. with respect to carotenogenesis, a significantly high abundance of mva pathway  and phosphomevalonate kinase ) and late carotenogenesis  and cpr ) enzymes was observed in succinate cultures.table  <dig>

metabolite profiling of x. dendrorhous cultured in fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources
to compare the relative amounts of metabolites in the different samples collected, the response ratio of each metabolite normalized to the internal standard ribitol was transformed to log <dig>  significant differences  between samples from succinate and glucose cultures were evaluated and the complete datasets are presented in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

a total of  <dig> polar metabolites associated with primary metabolism were analyzed, and the functional classification is shown in the heat map in the figure  <dig>  the metabolomes of different yeast samples cultured in glucose or succinate as carbon sources were compared at the same growth stage, and the highest differences were observed in tca cycle intermediates, sugars and some amino acid metabolic pools.figure  <dig> metabolite profile of x. dendrorhous. for each metabolite in glucose  or succinate , the response ratio was normalized to log <dig>  the m/z values of selected ions used for quantification are shown in parentheses. each column graphic represents the growth phases studied. l: lag, ee: early exponential, le: late exponential, s: stationary. red or blue color indicates that the metabolite content is decreased or increased, respectively. metabolites were grouped according to the kegg database. abbreviations: tca: tricarboxylic acid cycle, dhap: dihydroxyacetone phosphate, pep: phosphoenolpyruvate.



particularly, trehalose had the highest signal intensity observed under both growth conditions, although this sugar was significantly more abundant in succinate.

over the entire course of cultivation in succinate, significantly high abundance of the metabolic pools of tca cycle intermediates and amino acids derivate were observed . similarly, the metabolites of gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle were more abundant in succinate.

in glucose cultures, the metabolites and amino acids derived from the initial steps of glycolysis and pp pathway were more abundant than those observed in succinate.

metabolome and proteome mapping
to correlate the identified proteins and metabolite dynamics, we adapted the principal carbon, amino acid and carotenogenesis pathways from the kegg database . to facilitate comparison, the mean values of the metabolites or proteins, represented as the response ratio transformed to log <dig> or the normalized-intensity value, respectively, were normalized to  <dig> according to the growth phase. the normalized data for glucose or succinate were shown in a column diagram including the standard deviation and student’s t-test adjusted results by benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction. for the proteins, the multiple column charts represent the presence of post-translational modification  on pathways figures.figure  <dig> protein and metabolite levels in the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate and tca pathways. according to the carbon source the mean value and sd of abundance for each protein, and the response ratio for each metabolite were normalized to a value of  <dig>  each column graphic represents the growth phases studied . in the column charts a color code was included to differentiate proteins and metabolites found when x. dendrorhous was cultured with the different carbon sources: proteins in glucose , proteins in succinate , metabolites in glucose  and metabolites in succinate . the pathways were adapted from the kegg database. in the metabolic pathways, names are written in a color letters: metabolites , glycolysis proteins , gluconeogenesis proteins , glyoxylate proteins  and tca proteins . proteins involved in both, the glyoxylate and tca cycle, are underlined and cytosolic proteins related to acetyl-coa formation are indicated in red. an asterisk beside the protein name and in the multiple column charts indicates that the protein probably suffers post-translational modifications as it was identified in multiple spots. statistical significant differences between samples from different carbon sources at the same growth phase are represented as stars  and triangles . abbreviations: p: phosphate, tca: tricarboxylic acid cycle.



the additional file 5: figure s2a, shows the sugar metabolism pathway. in glucose, the clear high abundance of α-glucosidase and glucokinase enzymes and the metabolites d-glucose, d-fructose and d-mannitol are evidence of the major availability of this carbon source.

the other identified enzymes did not show significant differences during growth in both carbon sources. notably, a majority of the identified metabolites were more abundant in glucose cultures, likely reflecting the post-translational mechanisms regulating enzymatic activities. in succinate cultures, the increased abundance of the enzyme trehalase was observed during the stationary phase, associated with a significant increase in the sugar trehalose. interestingly, the accumulation of this sugar has been associated with the oxidative stress response  <cit> .

in general, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway enzymes did not show significant differences in abundance . however, a clear metabolite tendency was observed: in glucose cultures, early glycolysis metabolites were increased, while metabolites generated during the final glycolysis reactions were significantly higher in succinate cultures .

for the pp pathway, a direct correlation between the abundance of the proteins involved and the generated metabolites was not observed. for example, some enzymes  were markedly increased in glucose. however, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and ribose 5-phosphate isomerase were significantly abundant in succinate cultures . in general, all metabolites were more abundant in glucose and consistent with previous studies  <cit> , the regulation of the abundance of some proteins in this pathway such as glucose 6-p dehydrogenase was observed.

regarding pyruvate metabolism , pyruvate dehydrogenase, which facilitates the formation of acetyl-coa in the mitochondria, was more abundant at the beginning of the growth curve when cultured in glucose, but during the late exponential growth phase, a notable increase in succinate was observed. this behavior is likely associated with increased acetyl-coa generation through glycolysis in glucose cultures, and pyruvate production through gluconeogenesis in succinate cultures. other pyruvate metabolism enzymes such as acetyl-coa synthase and adh, were more abundant when x. dendrorhous was cultured in glucose , likely reflecting the influence of the carbon source and its role in fermentation reactions.

because succinate is directly incorporated into the tca cycle, the enzymes and metabolites from the tca and glyoxylate cycles were significantly more abundant in succinate cultures, suggesting that the carbon source affects the high level of metabolite production in this pathway under aerobic growth conditions . correspondingly, the high abundance of some oxidative phosphorylation enzymes such as atp synthase α, nadh dehydrogenase and metabolites such as succinate and fumarate, were detected in succinate cultures . consistently, some enzymes involved in metabolism of the fatty acids and glycerophospholipids such as fatty acid synthase  and acyl-coa synthase, showed significant abundance in succinate cultures .

figure 4b shows the comparison between the abundance of amino acids, enzymes and metabolites that precedes the synthesis of these molecules in the related pathways. for instance, the amino acids generated from the glycolysis and pp pathways such as β-alanine, cysteine and tryptophan were more abundant in glucose cultures. however, the amino acids derived from the tca cycle, such as lysine, aspartate and glutamine, showed higher abundance in succinate cultures.

in x. dendrorhous, carotenoid synthesis begins with the formation of ipp from acetyl-coa through mva. from this pathway, mk showed a remarkable increase in succinate cultures. another two enzymes involved in sequential steps in this pathway, phosphomevalonate kinase and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, also showed significant increments in succinate cultures during the early exponential and lag phases of growth, respectively .

the enzymes involved in the production of carotenogenesis precursors such as prenyltransferase and squalene synthase, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis, were more abundant in glucose cultures . moreover, the enzymes involved in the last steps of carotenogenesis in x. dendrorhous, astaxanthin synthase and cpr, were significantly higher in succinate cultures  suggesting that the increased production of astaxanthin in yeast grown in succinate might depend on the availability of the substrates  and the abundance of these two enzymes.

discussion
carbon source influence on carotenogenesis and central metabolism in x. dendrorhous
in the present study, we provided a detailed analysis of the influence of carbon sources  in the central metabolism of the yeast x. dendrorhous, revealing noticeable differences between the studied metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, pp pathway, tca and glyoxylate cycles and lipid metabolism.

overall, a direct relation between the carbon source and the identified metabolites was observed. for instance in glucose cultures, the metabolites involved in the initial steps of glycolysis and in the pp pathway were more abundant , suggesting enzymatic regulation through fructose 1– <dig> diphosphate  <cit> .

in the present study, regulation via the abundance of glycolytic enzymes including glucokinase, gapdh and enolase, was observed . consistently, when s. cerevisiae is cultured in glucose or a non-fermentable carbon source the same trend has been described  <cit> . additionally in our study the enzyme gapdh was identified in multiple spots under both carbon sources conditions, but the spots did not show a similar abundance pattern , suggesting a post-translational regulation mechanism such as phosphorylation. other carbohydrate metabolism enzymes regulated through phosphorylation during yeast growth with different carbon sources and under stress conditions have been identified  <cit> .

the pp pathway is regulated through competitive inhibition  <cit>  and post-translational modifications via phosphorylation  <cit> . in addition this pathway is considered as the primary source of nadph, which is markedly important in the oxidative stress response to remove ros  <cit> . thus, two pp pathway enzymes, transketolase and transaldolase, were overexpressed in s. cerevisiae to overcome the sod deficiency  <cit> . our results show that phosphoglucomutase , which is involved in the pp pathway, glycolysis and trehalose synthesis, was upregulated during carotenogenesis induction in cultures with both carbon sources . interestingly, an increase in this enzyme in response to h2o <dig> treatment has also been observed  <cit> . considering that x. dendrorhous requires oxygen and nadph for carotenogenesis, our results suggest that the high activity of this metabolic pathway might be required to remove ros in the absence or with low levels of another enzymatic defense mechanism.

it has been previously reported that the addition of succinate increases the emission of h2o <dig> in mitochondria leading to a higher respiration rate  <cit> . in the present study, a direct effect on yeast growth in succinate medium with increase in the metabolites and enzymes of the tca and glyoxylate cycles , oxidative phosphorylation  and amino acid derivatives , was observed. furthermore, an increased production of carotenoids was obtained reflecting the direct incorporation of succinate into the tca cycle, generating more substrates that could increase the respiratory rate in the cell leading to ros accumulation and thereby, favoring carotenoid production.

regarding lipid metabolism, x. dendrorhous is an oleaginous yeast species  <cit>  with a high flux of pp pathway and high enzymatic activity of the citrate lyase and phosphoketolase  <cit> . furthermore, citrate accumulation has been associated with lipid accumulation reflecting the low or absent activity of the isocitrate dehydrogenase in mitochondria. thus, citrate is transported to the cytosol for the production of acetyl-coa through atp citrate lyase  <cit> . in our study a similar abundance of isocitrate dehydrogenase and atp-citrate lyase was observed in x. dendrorhous cultured in both carbon sources . in this sense, the increased expression of carotenogenic genes in a x. dendrorhous mutant was associated with the low content of ergosterol and fatty acids and the flux of acetyl-coa for astaxanthin production  <cit> .

availability of acetyl-coa and its association with carotenogenesis
acetyl-coa is a key substrate for diverse cellular processes in the nucleus, mitochondria, cytosol and peroxisome. in the cell, acetyl-coa is involved in several functions such as chromatin regulation, and it is a precursor for fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis  <cit> . in addition, acetyl-coa is the end product of lipid degradation through β-oxidation and is essential for energy production in the tca cycle and the synthesis of c <dig> metabolites through the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . furthermore, acetyl-coa is also the precursor for diverse compounds such as waxes, flavonoids, carotenoids and isoprenoids  <cit> .

during growth in glycolytic carbon sources, pyruvate is transformed into acetyl-coa through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  in the mitochondria. in this sense, the x. dendrorhous α subunit of pda showed greater abundance in glucose with a higher peak at the lag growth phase. in succinate, the α subunit of pda showed a lower abundance with a peak during the late exponential phase, indicative of acetyl coa synthesis through gluconeogenesis .

for some microorganisms, the pyruvate-acetaldehyde-acetate pathway generates acetyl-coa, which is the main source of cytoplasmic acetyl-coa in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . this pathway includes the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase , acetaldehyde dehydrogenase  and acetyl-coa synthase   <cit> . in fungi, pdc is induced under aerobic conditions  <cit>  and in the presence of glucose in x. dendrorhous  <cit> . interesting, in the present study we observed a higher abundance of pdc in succinate growth .

atp-citrate lyase  is an exclusive cytoplasmic source of acetyl-coa in oleaginous yeast  <cit> . for x. dendrorhous the source of acetyl-coa for carotenoid production could primarily be generated through an increased activity of acl in the presence of o <dig> leading to carotenoid accumulation  <cit> . in the present study, a similar abundance of acl was observed under both growth conditions . therefore, the increased production of astaxanthin in succinate cultures is not directly associated with an increase of acl abundance. on the other hand, the cytoplasmic enzyme atp citrate synthase, which catalyzes the formation of acetyl-coa, is primarily involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and sterols. the results presented herein showed a similar abundance of this enzyme in growth media containing either carbon source . notably, in a recent study, high levels of succinate promoted an increase in cytosolic citrate synthase activity without inhibiting yeast growth  <cit> .

in summary, these results suggest that the production of cytosolic acetyl-coa is crucial for x. dendrorhous growth, which depends on the available carbon source. thus, in glucose we observed a higher abundance of enzymes and metabolites of the pyruvate-acetaldehyde-acetate pathway derived from glycolysis and fermentation. in succinate, the low abundance of acetyl coa carboxylase favors astaxanthin synthesis probably with reduced fatty acid content. similar levels of the enzymes atp citrate lyase and atp-citrate synthase were observed during growth in both carbon sources, indicating the importance of cytoplasmic acetyl-coa for generating fatty acids and astaxanthin.

oxidative stress and its association with the synthesis of astaxanthin in x. dendrorhous
due to the antioxidant properties of carotenoids, the accumulation of these molecules is a survival strategy in various microorganisms  <cit> . thus, oxidative stress stimulates the synthesis of carotenoids  <cit> . in addition to the degradation of cell membranes and lipids, ros act as intracellular signaling molecules that activate cellular defense systems, thereby improving the resistance and adaptation of microorganisms in unfavorable environments  <cit> . metabolic ros production depends on the o <dig> concentration  <cit>  therefore; ros are endogenously generated in cells during respiration and β-oxidation  <cit> . in yeast, the increased amount of h2o <dig> generated during β-oxidation in peroxisome is neutralized with high levels of catalase  <cit> . however, the absence or low activity of this enzyme in x. dendrorhous has been reported  <cit> , suggesting the important antioxidant role of carotenoids in this organism.

cell antioxidant mechanisms also include non-enzymatic molecules such as glutathione and enzymatic systems such as sod, catalase and glutathione peroxidase  <cit> . apparently, x. dendrorhous exhibits low levels of these enzymatic systems  <cit> . indeed, in the present study, only the mitochondrial mnsod enzyme and some glutathione metabolic enzymes  were identified.

for the redox and stress response proteins, similar abundance pattern during carotenogenesis induction was observed. thus, in glucose we observed the positive regulation of a monooxygenase , mnsod  and cytochrome p <dig>  . similarly, in succinate during the early exponential phase the monooxygenase  and cytochrome p <dig>   were increased. within this group of proteins, specifically the p <dig> and monooxygenase could have a role in the induction of carotenogenesis independent of the carbon source. these two proteins are strongly associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including carotenoids  <cit> . thus these enzymes may perform auxiliary reactions for astaxanthin synthesis.

a stress indicator observed in the present study was trehalose accumulation. the synthesis of trehalose is considered as a defense mechanism against a variety of stress conditions including the presence of ros  <cit> , and the protective role of this sugar against ros has been demonstrated in cell deficient in sod  <cit> . the first reaction of the thehalose cycle is catalyzed through the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucomutase  <cit> . interestingly, in the present study, this enzyme exhibited both glucose and succinate abundance coincident with carotenogenesis induction . correspondingly, trehalose was the most abundant metabolite observed in the present study. when the amount of thehalose  was compared between the two carbon sources, a significant increase was observed in succinate during the late exponential phase and the stationary phase.

related to the stress response an increase in several carbohydrate metabolism enzymes has been found, which might redirect the carbon flux to generate antioxidant substrates or activate the production of cell protective substances. for instance, when stress is induced in h. pluvialis, a transient increase in several glycolysis and pp pathway proteins was observed  <cit> , indicating that the early response to stress includes enzymatic defense processes and affects central metabolic pathways, leading to the cellular accumulation of astaxanthin. in the present study, gapdh and phosphoglucomutase were positively regulated during the carotenogenesis induction ). interesting, in s. cerevisiae three isoforms of gapdh associated with glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the stress response were observed  <cit> . in our study, gapdh was identified in multiple points which indicate a probable post-translational regulation of this enzyme according to the carbon source .

in s. cerevisiae a common, cross reaction response to various stress conditions has been observed  <cit> , suggesting that various stress situations generate high oxidant conditions, leading to stress responses in cells. a stress core has been identified in s. cerevisiae, s. pombe and c. albicans  <cit> . the results of the present study, suggest that in x. dendrorhous, the antioxidant core during carotenogenesis induction in glucose and succinate includes a monooxygenase, a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme, phosphoglucomutase and gapdh.

in summary, our results clearly support a relationship between the synthesis of astaxanthin and response to stress in x. dendrorhous. first, several redox- and stress-related proteins were identified, and the modulation in their abundance during the induction of carotenogenesis were determined. these proteins have been previously identified in other proteomic studies associated with different types of stress responses in several microorganisms. second, the induction of the carotenoid synthesis was consistent with the positive regulation of phosphoglucomutase, which initiates synthesis of trehalose that is a major metabolite identified in both carbon sources as a stress indicator. third, only one typical antioxidant enzyme, mnsod, was identified. therefore, these results suggest that during aerobic growth, the concerted expression of stress-related proteins induces carotenogenesis as a protective mechanism in x. dendrorhous.

carotenogenesis and related pathways in x. dendrorhous
in x. dendrorhous, ipp, a general precursor of all isoprenoids, is produced through the mva pathway . this pathway is also the precursor for ergosterol formation. therefore, the functioning of the cell signaling processes, the maintenance of membrane integrity, prenylation and protein glycosylation depend on the mva pathway  <cit> .

the main regulatory enzyme of the mva pathway is hmgr  <cit> . recently we observed that in x. dendrorhous the gene expression of this enzyme is likely regulated through ergosterol via negative feedback  <cit> . similarly, the levels of gpp, fpp and ggpp regulate mk, another mva pathway enzyme  <cit> . in the present study, the amount of mk  in succinate was significantly higher than that in glucose . this result is consistent with observations in succinate cultures, where a high level of tca intermediates associated with the presence of an increased amount of available substrate  was observed.

concerning the specific carotenogenic pathway in x. dendrorhous, glucose exhaustion has been correlated with the high levels of carotenogenic mrnas  <cit> . in contrast, the transcriptional regulation in succinate remains unclear; indeed, the carotenogenic genes are constitutively expressed  <cit> . in the present study, the abundance of only a single carotenogenic enzyme, the phytoene/squalene synthase , was observed during the late exponential growth phase when the yeast was cultured in glucose . for the other carotenogenic enzymes, no clear relation with the reported transcriptional regulation profile was observed.

additionally, the enzymes involved in steps up-stream to lycopene formation were abundant in glucose culture. however, the enzymes involved in the last step of carotenogenesis, cpr  and astaxanthin synthase  , showed significant abundance in succinate culture, suggesting a post-translational regulation mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, comprehensive analyses of the proteins and metabolites profile, produced in yeast cultured with fermentable  and non-fermentable  carbon sources were performed. the utilization of glucose or succinate as a sole carbon source showed clear distinguishable differences in principal and related metabolic pathways. the main differences observed corresponded to the enhancement of the glycolysis and pp pathways in glucose, and tca and glyoxylate cycles in succinate.

regulation at the protein level was associated with astaxanthin biosynthesis. first, under fermentative conditions, the cell responds to ensure the acetyl-coa supply through various metabolic alternatives. second, the concerted positive regulation of redox- and stress-related proteins  is correlated with carotenogenesis induction. third, trehalose accumulation, associated with oxidative stress, influences carotenogenesis. fourth, the differential protein abundance of carotenogenic enzymes is not correlated with the carotenogenic transcript pattern; indeed, for late carotenogenic enzymes, post-translational regulation is likely involved.

moreover, these results suggest that astaxanthin is an alternative mechanism in response to cellular or environmental stress conditions in x. dendrorhous.
