BACKGROUND
glioblastoma  is the most common primary central nervous system tumor and accounts for approximately 40% of all primary malignant brain tumors. gb is a heterogeneous group of tumors associated with a very poor clinical prognosis. the median survival for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is approximately  <dig> months and declines to approximately  <dig> months for patients with recurrent glioma  <cit> . the 6-month progression free survival for glioblastoma is less than 20%. the biology of malignant glioma presents significant problems for successful clinical treatment. chief among these hurdles is the aggressive local invasion of malignant cells from the original tumor. the heightened commitment to migration and reduced proliferation of invasive glioma cells makes complete surgical resection impossible, increases their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and reduces the efficacy of radiation treatment, which virtually assures tumor recurrence. improved clinical treatment will therefore ultimately require a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the invasion of glioma cells from primary tumor sites as well as the identification and specific targeting of the critical drivers of glioma invasion.

the pathobiology of gb is characterized by temporal and spatial alterations in gene expression that produce phenotypically distinct cell populations. necrosis, micro-vascular proliferation, and increased staining for proliferation markers histopathologically characterize the highly cellular tumor core. in contrast, invasive cells at the tumor – normal brain interface exhibit a decrease in the expression of proliferation markers and a relative increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes  <cit> . gene expression profiling of laser-captured micro dissected cells from paired gb patient tumor core and invasive edge established an invasion signature of genes differentially expressed in the invasive cell population. this gene set represents potential targets to limit glioma dispersal and decreased therapeutic resistance as the invasion process strongly up-regulates survival signaling pathways  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of pro-invasive or pro-proliferation signaling proteins are not completely understood. one potential mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is through micrornas . mirs are a highly diverse class of small , non-protein coding single stranded rna molecules that play a central role in a broad range of normal biological processes by dynamically regulating protein expression  <cit> . mir activity has also been linked to various cancers where mirs can function either as potential oncogenes or as tumor suppressors  <cit> . a potential role for a number of mirs in gb progression has been reported in recent studies  <cit> . the majority of the studies were performed with cultured glioma cell lines or primary gb patient samples to annotate global changes in mir expression, but did not investigate mir expression in distinct glioma cell populations. in the current study, we investigated a dataset of mirs collected from a matched pair of migration-restricted glioma cell and migratory glioma cell populations to identify differentially expressed mirs associated with each cell population. we conducted pathway enrichment analysis with these mirs to investigate potential associated gene targets. signaling effectors regulated by the identified differentially expressed mirs represents a potentially rich set of targets for therapeutic development.

RESULTS
the differential expression  was down-regulated in  <dig> , and up-regulated in  <dig>  of the  <dig> mirs in our study. of the  <dig> down-regulated mirs,  <dig>  exhibited both significant fdr corrected p-values and a ≥ 2x fold change, while  <dig>  did not. of the  <dig> up-regulated mirs,  <dig>  exhibited both significant fdr corrected p-values and a ≥ 2x fold change, while  <dig>  did not. the results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between expression direction  and differential expression p-value / fold change .

a plot of the differential expression of these data  illustrates graphically the distribution of mirs that are both significant  and meaningful  . those mirs located both above the fdr corrected -log10p-value , and a greater than 2x log <dig> fold change , are considered both significant and meaningful. grey colored dots in the volcano plot represent those mirs that are either not significant or do not have a ≥ twofold differential expression. black dots represent those mirs that exhibit both a significant differential expression and a ≥ 2x fold change, and thus represent those  <dig> mirs considered for further study .

recent studies have demonstrated that many of the significant mirs elucidated in our study have been previously implicated in tumor migration/invasion in other cancers, including malignancies in the brain. for some of our identified mirs however, we were unable to find any prior literature that reported validated gene targets. to address this limitation, we utilized several available algorithms that predict gene targets in silico, such as targetscan or pictar. additionally, resources are available that perform enrichment calculations on representative gene categories or biological pathways. these groups could include such categories as signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, apoptosis, proliferation, or transcription factors  <cit> . for glioma cell migration, categories such as adhesion and cytoskeletal organization would be important to study further for verification. we turned to these bioinformatics approaches to obtain a wider view of potential genes and pathways that could be targeted by these identified mirs.

we employed the diana-mirpath  <cit>  pathway analysis web-server to accomplish both target prediction and enrichment analysis. we used three gene target prediction algorithms in mirpath: targetscan v <dig>  pictar 4-way, and diana microt v <dig> to analyze the datasets as separate jobs . after the gene targets were predicted, mirpath calculated the enrichment of genes in all biological pathways available in the kegg database. after analysis, the user is presented with a visualization of any pathways that contained at least one gene. the pathways are ranked according to an enrichment significance score based on a fisher’s combined probability  test  <cit> . diana-mirpath also provides a union of pathways feature. using this technique we were able to identify all significantly targeted pathways by the selected mirs. as above, the fisher’s meta-analysis method was used to calculate p-values to illustrate the probability that the examined pathway is significantly enriched with gene targets of at least one selected mir  <cit> . for our list of  <dig> mirs,  <dig> enrichment pathways are highly significant . the glioma pathway is ranked as the 7th most significant , and  <dig> of the  <dig> highest ranked pathways are cancer-related, such as endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer. in order to examine the specificity of this approach we conducted the identical union of pathways analysis with a set of  <dig> randomly selected mirs. for this list of randomly selected mirs, the glioma pathway is not significant . a total of  <dig> unique genes were identified as potential targets by the three prediction algorithms for glioma pathways .

despite the high rank of the glioma pathway reported by mirpath, we sought a more detailed view of the mir-gene interactions. we postulated that some genes might be preferentially targeted by multiple mirs in our dataset. other studies employing mir pathway analysis favor comparing the results of multiple prediction algorithms to find consensus interactions  <cit> . taking a similar approach, we recorded every potential mir-gene interaction among the glioma pathway for all three of the prediction algorithms . we summarized the findings with prediction consensus counts  to identify the number of algorithms that predicted each mir-gene interaction. we preferentially focused our attention on interactions unanimously predicted by all three algorithms . we then summed the number of unanimous interactions for each gene to assess the enrichment of single genes . this count provided an empirical indication that some genes are potentially targeted by many of the top mirs identified in our analysis. all  <dig> algorithms predict a glioma pathway gene target by  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated mirs in our study .

discussion
increased mir expression results in decreased messenger rna  expression, which in turn leads to decreased protein expression. conversely, decreased mir expression could result in increased target mrna expression, which in turn could lead to increased target protein expression. in the current study, we report the identification of a set of  <dig> mirs that exhibit statistically significant negative  differential expression in the migratory  cell population relative to the corresponding expression in the matched migration-restricted  cell population. bioinformatics analysis of potential targets of these down-regulated mirs produced a set of genes linked to regulation of apoptosis. genes targeted by the down-regulated mir set have potential for increased expression in the invasive cell population and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets to limit glioma progression.

to begin our investigation of our mirs, we conducted an extensive literature review of verified gene targets relevant to cancer. the let- <dig> family of mirs is well represented in our results. let- <dig> was one of the first two mirs identified and was shown to be a critical regulator of developmental timing  <cit> . the sequence of let- <dig> was later discovered in the fruit fly and human genomes via blast search and became the first recognized mir in humans  <cit> . interestingly, humans have  <dig> mature let- <dig> isoforms that are produced from  <dig> distinct precursor sequences located at different locations in the genome  <cit> . eight let- <dig> family members were present in the set of  <dig> significant down-regulated mirs in the migratory cell invasive population.

let- <dig> members are widely considered critical tumor suppressors that, when lost, can alter cell growth and cancer progression  <cit> . in glioblastoma, transfection of let-7 g into u <dig> and u <dig> glioblastoma cells reduced the expression of ras family proteins modulating proliferation and invasiveness  <cit> . notably, increased expression of let- <dig> inhibited in vitro proliferation and reduced tumor size in murine xenografts. other studies have validated ras as a target for let- <dig> family members  <cit> . in addition to let- <dig>  our analysis also indicated that ras proteins are potential targets for other mirs in our study: mir- <dig>  mir-27b, mir-30c and mir-15b . it is well appreciated that ras is an integral signaling constituent of many growth factor receptor pathways and that alterations in several growth factor receptor pathways, including egfr and pdgfr, are a dominant characteristic of glioblastoma. as ras signaling has been demonstrated to modulate glioblastoma cell proliferation  <cit> , the loss of these four mirs, along with let- <dig>  are likely to lead to altered ras expression and activity. target analysis also revealed that pdgfb is potentially targeted by many mirs in the study that together with pdgfr amplification provides a mechanism to potentiate tumor growth  <cit> .

two of the mirs in our study have been directly tied to neurological malignancies. let-7e has been shown to inhibit neuroblastoma proliferation by targeting the myc oncogene  <cit> . meanwhile, mir-181b has been strongly implicated as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma. substantial down-regulation of mir-181a and mir-181b has been observed in both human glioma samples and in established glioma cell lines  <cit> . expression of mir- <dig> was abundant in normal brain tissue, but dropped substantially with increasing who grades  <cit> . notably, transfection of mir-181b into glioblastoma cells significantly inhibited cell invasion in an in vitro matrigel invasion assay and increased apoptosis in the transfected cells  <cit> .

several mirs in our list appear to directly target apoptosis related genes. the anti-apoptotic protein bcl <dig> is a validated target of mir-181b <cit>  and mir- <dig> <cit> . furthermore, bcl-xl is degraded by let-7c <cit> . elevated levels of these proteins desensitize cells to apoptosis, and thus it is likely that loss of these relevant mirs in migratory edge cells may cause increased expression of genes and lead to inhibition of apoptosis.

from the pathway enrichment analysis, we find that cyclin d <dig>  stands out as a prominent target of a number of the mirs identified in this study . overexpression of the cyclin d <dig> protein is associated with tumorigenesis and is associated with poor outcome in a variety of cancers  <cit> . cyclin d <dig> is a critical gene involved in the cell cycle control pathway. it is a regulatory subunit for the cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> proteins, and these kinases form active complexes that are required for a cell to progress from g <dig> to s phase. cyclin d <dig> also binds to the retinoblastoma protein . rb <dig> is itself highly targeted by many of the mirs in our analysis . the rb <dig> protein, on the other hand, opposes g1/s checkpoint transitions. it is thus interesting that both of these proteins are predicted targets by the same mirs in the identified set. this suggests a tightly controlled feedback loop that precisely regulates the balance between either cell cycle progression, or arrest, at g <dig>  perturbations of this balance lead to alterations in cell proliferation.

mutations or aberrant expression of proteins in the cell cycle pathway have been associated with many cancers. in glioblastoma cell lines, it has been reported that cyclin d <dig> overexpression promotes invasiveness in vitro <cit> . furthermore, silencing cyclin d <dig> expression with sirna inhibited invasion and apoptosis. in vivo, abnormalities in the cell cycle pathway are well recognized. in primary gb, the function of the tumor suppressor proteins p16-ink4a and p14-arf is affected, whereas in secondary gb it is observed that cdk <dig> is amplified or rb <dig> is lost  <cit> . we speculate that loss of mirs targeting these proteins may lead to an overexpression of cyclin d <dig>  which can deregulate the cell cycle in concordance with these other pathway abnormalities observed in vivo. notably, our analysis identified a number of mirs that have been previously validated as targeting cyclin d <dig> including let7a-7f  <cit>  as well as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  <cit> . if many of the other target predictions are valid, then we postulate these mirs may form an integral network involved in regulation of the cell cycle. because cyclin d <dig> and rb <dig> are co-predicted by many of the same set of mirs, they may be appropriate targets for validation .

also among the mirnas that was significantly down-regulated in the invasive cell population was mir-23b. a previous report demonstrated that mir-23b targets a set of genes associated with tumor invasion and metastasis  <cit>  implicating its loss in facilitating tumor progression. similarly, a recent report has demonstrated that mir-23b directly targets pik3r <dig>  <cit>  substantiating its identification and predicted targeting of pik3r <dig> in the current analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
much progress in the understanding of mirs has been made over the past decade and research is identifying important functions for mirs in cancers such as glioblastoma. it is recognized that alterations in expression of mirnas can significantly alter the proliferation and invasiveness of cells. indeed, an increasing number of mirs have been validated as components of cancer-driving pathways. in this study we have applied a set of statistical and informatics tools and approaches, such as t-test, fdr, volcano plot, consensus mir target prediction and pathway analysis, to explore the role of mirs in glioblastoma. approaches similar to the ones described here, that combine bioinformatics analysis of experimentally generated data with in silico mir target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis can be applied to other diseases to provide biomedical researchers and clinicians with increased opportunities for therapeutic interventions.
