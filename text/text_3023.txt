BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that have thrived on our planet for at least  <dig> – <dig>  ga  <cit> . in the cryosphere cyanobacteria are major primary producers found in many types of habitats  where potential environmental pressures include exposure to high levels of ultraviolet radiation during the summer, complete absence of light during the winter at the poles, limited nutrient availability, rapid freeze-thaw cycles and low water activity  <cit> .

microorganisms  have numerous adaptations that enable them to survive at low temperatures. generic cold-shock mechanisms exist  that are responsible for maintaining cell membrane fluidity, destabilising nucleic acid secondary structures and helping to maintain chromosome structure in cold conditions . other mechanisms that have been proposed include the production of exopolysaccharides , which play a major role in protection from extreme cold environments  and allow for the scavenging of metal cations in oligotrophic conditions  <cit> . epss also serve as a carbon source for the microbial web .

while all of these mechanisms can be found in the majority of prokaryotes, little is understood about how they might differ in cyanobacteria from cold environments compared to their temperate relatives. many cyanobacteria commonly found in the cryosphere are also found in a variety of diverse habitats  where their persistence is due to a non-specific resilience to extreme environments. some lineages appear more localised to the cryosphere and as such may be more specialised to surviving in the cold. one such organism is the eps producing, non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria phormidesmis priestleyi. analysis of small subunit  rrna gene sequences has shown that p. priestleyi can be found throughout the global cryosphere  <cit> . trait evolution analyses have predicted that p. priestleyi had a cold tolerant ancestor  <cit> .

in the antarctic, p. priestleyi commonly grows in de-glaciated regions where it is typically found associated with moving water and glacial run-off  <cit> . in the arctic and alpine regions p. priestleyi ssu rrna gene sequences have been recovered from surface ice on glaciers in svalbard  <cit> , oligotrophic lakes in the pyrenees  <cit> , glaciers on the tibetan plateau  <cit>  and meltwater lakes on ice shelves in the canadian high arctic  <cit> . on the greenland ice sheet  it can be found in cryoconite holes; melt water pools on the surface of glaciers formed by reduced local albedo that contain inorganic and organic particulate matter  <cit> . cyanobacterial filaments constitute a large proportion of organic matter present in cryoconite granules and it is believed that cyanobacteria help to mediate the formation of cryoconite through the aggregation of particulate matter  <cit>  thus directly influencing the ‘biocryomorphology’ of ice surfaces  <cit> .

in this study we sequenced the genome of p. priestleyi bc <dig> using a recently developed de bruijn graph assembly viewer to remove non-cyanobacterial sequences from the assembly. we used blast analyses to investigate the presence of known cold stress related genes in this and closely related genomes. we identified genes for putative mechanisms responsible for the regulation, production and export of polysaccharides using blast and pfam domain searches. p. priestleyi bc <dig> is the first published draft genome of a cyanobacterium isolated from the cryosphere.

methods
cryoconite material was collected during the summer of  <dig> from nearby the university of utrecht’s s <dig> weather station on the gris  ~1000 m above sea level and ~30 km from the ice margin, before being transported back to bristol in a chilled container . in the laboratory, small amounts of cryoconite were transferred to petri dishes of sterile liquid bg- <dig>  <cit>  and incubated at 4 °c for 4– <dig> weeks.

axenic cultures have typically been used for the sequencing of single strains of cyanobacteria. however, several problems are associated with this approach. firstly, certain strains may be reliant upon their commensal biota for successful growth e.g. due to utilisation of secondary metabolites  <cit> . second, the process is labour intensive and hard to include within the timeframe of a small scale research program. finally, cultures will undergo many generations during the process of growth and purification; this might result in significant molecular divergence of cultured strains from wild-type organisms. the methods shown here have allowed for the sequencing of a unialgal strain along with its commensal microbiota with the successful removal of contaminating  sequences during the assembly process. to obtain unialgal strains individual cyanobacterial filaments were separated using a microscope and glass needle, transferred to culture tubes containing sterile liquid bg- <dig>  and incubated at 15 °c. after a further 4– <dig> weeks, a successful culture was transferred back to petri dishes of sterile liquid bg- <dig> and grown at 4 °c until sufficient biomass was available to extract gdna. harvested cells were stored in sterile  <dig>  ml tubes at −20 °c.

dna extraction and sequencing
extraction of dna from cyanobacteria can often be inhibited by the presence of epss and thick cell walls. in order to address this issue we used a simple chemical/mechanical lysis method to rupture cells prior to extraction. approximately  <dig>  ml cellular material was defrosted and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 30 s in a  <dig>  ml tube. the supernatant was removed and the pellet washed in 500 μl milli-q water. this process was repeated three times before the pellet was transferred to a clean  <dig>  ml tube. the pellet was then re-suspended in 200 μl solulyse   and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. the entire contents of the tube were then transferred to a mo bio   <dig>  mm bead beading tube and vortexed at full power for 5 min. gdna was then extracted from the lysate using machery-nagel axg <dig>  gravity flow columns according to the manufacturers protocol . integrity of high molecular weight gdna was assessed using gel imaging  and quantified using qubit  assay before being sent for sequencing. library preparation was done using the illumina truseq nano dna library preparation kit  according to the manufacturers instructions with a final average library size distribution  of 650 bp. sequencing was done using illumina hi-seq  <dig>  to generate a total of  <dig> , <dig> 100 bp paired-end reads with an insert size of ~600 bp. data was processed using rta v <dig> . <dig>  with default filter and quality settings. the reads were demultiplexed with casava v <dig> . <dig> .

assembly
before genome analysis could be carried out it was necessary to separate the cyanobacterial genome from non-cyanobacterial sequences. an ideal prokaryotic assembly produced by a de bruijn graph based assembler such as spades  <cit>  would produce a single chromosome where there is only one possible path between nodes . however, ambiguities often remain in an assembly  that result in de bruijn graphs with multiple edges . while these multi-edges prevent the formation of a single conclusive chromosome, they can be used to determine relationships between clusters of smaller contigs. while this information is usually discarded it can be used to isolate individual genomes from a metagenome, and validated where contigs can be simultaneously defined by some other shared characteristic such as read depth, blast similarity or sequence composition. visualisation of this information has recently been made available in the de bruijn graph viewer bandage  <cit> .

prior to assembly illumina truseq-3-pe adapters were trimmed and reads filtered for quality using trimmomatic v <dig>   <cit>  using the following parameters: leading: <dig>  trailing: <dig>  slidingwindow:4: <dig>  minlen: <dig>  error correction and assembly was done using spades v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with k-mer lengths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and a coverage cut-off of  <dig>  spades fastg files were then opened in bandage v <dig>   <cit>  and a blast database generated for the entire assembly. one thousand and fifty-four core cyanobacterial clusters of orthologous groups of proteins   exclusive to cyanobacteria and plastids were searched against this database using tblastn v <dig> .30+ with an e-value threshold of 1e- <dig>  cyanobacterial contigs were identified as graph nodes containing core cyogs and connected nodes with similar read depth. additional unconnected nodes with similar coverage to confirmed cyanobacterial contigs were checked manually by performing further tblastn searches against the entire ncbi genbank database ; those that did not contain putative cyanobacterial genes were discarded. finally, contigs with read depth < <dig> were discarded to remove remaining non-cyanobacterial contigs and contigs with length <200 bp were discarded to bring into line with ncbi standards. raw reads were mapped to the resulting draft assembly using bwa  <cit> . reads that did not map to the cyanobacterial assembly were discarded, revealing an overall coverage of the p. priestleyi bc <dig> genome of  <dig> ×.

the draft genome was submitted to jgi img/er  <cit>  for annotation . based on sequence similarity, the assembled genome was aligned to its nearest neighbour with a finished genome, leptolygnbya boryana pcc  <dig> with contiguator v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using blastn with an e-value of 1e- <dig>  a contig length threshold of  <dig>  a hit length threshold of  <dig> and a contig coverage threshold of 10 %. identification of specific genes of interest was done using blastp  and further searches for pfam domains were made if blast searches yielded ambiguous results. these analyses were performed using tools available in jgi img/er  <cit> .

to infer structural homology of proteins where certain domains were absent, genes were aligned in jalview v <dig> .0b <dig>  <cit>  and protein structures modelled using the phyre <dig> web portal  <cit> .

genome plots were produced in circos v <dig>   <cit>  and gene diagrams were made using fancygene v <dig>   <cit> . all plots were manually edited using inkscape v <dig>   <cit> .

this whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj/ena/genbank under the accession lxyr <dig>  the version described in this paper is version lxyr <dig>  genome sequence and annotation data are available at the jgi img/er database  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
a ssu rrna dataset was constructed including p. priestleyi bc <dig> and a further  <dig> cyanobacteria genomes as used by sánchez-baracaldo  <cit> . additionally, the ssu rrna sequence p. priestleyi ant.l <dig>   <cit>  was included as a reference for an antarctic strain of p. priestleyi. an alignment of  <dig>  characters was generated using saté  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  . phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out using raxml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the gtr + g model. the tree was constrained using the  <dig> taxa phylogenomic  tree described in sánchez-baracaldo  <cit> . trees were visualised using figtree v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and manually edited in inkscape v <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
our phylogenetic analyses indicate that p. priestleyi bc <dig> is sister to phormidesmis ant.l <dig>  from the mcmurdo dry valleys, antarctica. these two lineages are sister to l. boryana pcc  <dig>  oscillatoriales cyanobacterium jsc- <dig> and geitlerinema sp. pcc  <dig> . these strains are nested within a group of small cell diameter filamentous lineages within the microcyanobacteria  <cit> . genome statistics and sampling locations for all complete genomes used in this study are shown in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> ssu rrna maximum likelihood phylogeny showing relatives of p. priestleyi bc <dig>  tree topology was enforced using a phylogenomic constraint tree containing  <dig> taxa   <cit> . the tree is divided into ‘basal lineages’, ‘microcyanobacteria’ and ‘macrocyanobacteria’ as described in sánchez-baracaldo  <cit> . the clade containing p. priestleyi bc <dig> and related lineages is highlighted in green with bootstrap support  shown



the de bruijn graph of the entire raw assembly consisted of  <dig> nodes with  <dig> edges and a total length of  <dig> ,715 bp representing a metagenome containing both p. priestleyi bc <dig> and its associated microbiota. the main cyanobacterial portion of the graph was determined as a cluster of  <dig> nodes linked by  <dig> edges  with a mean depth of  <dig> . of these,  <dig> nodes with  <dig> edges  and a mean depth of  <dig>  had positive blast hits for core cyogs. all blast hits for core cyogs were contained within the main cyanobacterial portion of the graph . the final assembled draft genome of p. priestleyi bc <dig> constituted a total of  <dig> contigs containing  <dig>  protein-encoding genes . contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ,82 bp and the assembly had an n <dig> of  <dig>  bases. genome size was estimated to be  <dig>  mb with an overall gc content of  <dig>  %. the sequenced genome size of p. priestleyi bc <dig> was found to be smaller than that of its closet relative with a complete genome,  l. boryana pcc  <dig> , while having slightly higher gc content. despite the smaller size in relation to l. boryana pcc  <dig> all  <dig>  core cyogs were present in the p. priestleyi bc <dig> draft genome suggesting a nearly complete assembly. eighty-five contigs were successfully mapped to l. boryana pcc  <dig>   leaving  <dig> smaller contigs  unmapped. a plot displaying all unmapped contigs can be seen in additional file  <dig>  forty-five of these contigs were below  <dig>  bp in length and  <dig> were dropped from the alignment due to low coverage.fig.  <dig> circular plot of the p. priestleyi bc <dig> genome ordered according to l. boryana pcc  <dig>  rings are as follows : 1) mapped contigs, contigs containing genes putatively involved in eps biosynthesis and export are highlighted in red; 2) annotated genes are shown in dark grey, outer = plus strand, inner = minus strand; 3) putative wspr homologues are shown in dark grey, contigs are highlighted in blue; 4) alg44-like genes that are components of abc-transporters are shown in dark grey, contigs are highlighted in blue; 5) other alg44-like genes are shown in dark grey, contigs are highlighted in blue. wedges show locations of putative gene clusters involved in wzy-, abc-dependent-, wsp- and other non eps specific polysaccharide biosynthesis/export pathways



cold adaptation
molecular evolution related to cold adaptation can leave distinct signatures on organism’s genomes . the percentage of proline residues in the hypothetical proteome of p. priestleyi bc <dig>  was similar to that of l. boryana pcc  <dig>  and oscillatoriales cyanobacterium jsc- <dig>  and was slightly higher in geitlerinema sp. pcc  <dig> . the ratio of arginine to lysine in bc <dig>  was also comparable to pcc  <dig>  and jsc- <dig> , while being slightly higher in pcc  <dig> . given the large temperature ranges experienced by each of these strains  it appears that there is no obvious signal of increased genomic adaptation to the cold in bc <dig> compared to other cyanobacteria typically found in warmer habitats.

temperature stress in bacteria is managed by cold shock or heat shock mechanisms, allowing cells to function at low temperatures or to survive above their thermal optimum. in bacteria, many genes have been identified that encode proteins related to cellular responses to cold stress   <cit> . several of the proteins implicated in cold shock also act as heat shock proteins. since the physiological optimum of cryoconite phototrophs is above that encountered in the environment  <cit> , cold stress is likely very important in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  however, if organisms are acclimated to growing at low temperatures then in the event of sudden warming a heat stress response may still occur. the numbers of blast hits in the p. priestleyi bc <dig> genome for genes implicated in cold shock response as compared to its three closest relatives with complete genomes  are shown in table  <dig>  all genes listed were present in all genomes with the exception of the following: csp-family genes were absent from oscillatoriales cyanobacterium jsc- <dig>  otsa was found only in geitlerinema sp. pcc <dig>  and yfiaa was absent from l. boryana pcc <dig>  otherwise, copy number variation between the four genomes was minimal with no clear increase in cold stress genes in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  this included genes for chaperones that are also involved in heat shock response  and no difference in copy number among the compared cyanobacterial genomes was found for the heat shock specific gene grpe  <cit> . even so, it is possible that currently uncharacterised genes involved in cold tolerance  may yet remain unidentified within the p. priestleyi bc <dig> genome.table  <dig> numbers of blast hits for genes implicated in bacterial cold shock response in all strains used in this study

the apparent absence of differentiation of cold shock genes between p. priestleyi bc <dig> and temperate lineages could be related to the tendency of polar cyanobacteria to be psycrotrophs rather than psychrophiles, exhibiting optimal growth at far higher temperatures than the low ambient temperatures that they are likely to experience in the environment  <cit> . in light of this, it may be that more universal mechanisms such as the production of epss are responsible for the success of cyanobacteria in cold environments.

eps production mechanisms in p. priestleyi bc1401
while not fully characterised experimentally in cyanobacteria, the genes responsible for eps biosynthesis and export in cyanobacteria have been clearly outlined in pereira et al.  <cit> . these genes encode the constituent proteins of several specific pathways in gram-negative bacteria that were initially studied in e. coli . in the following sections, we report the distribution of these genes throughout the genome of p. priestleyi bc <dig> 

production of prokaryotic epss within the cell typically occurs in three main steps  <cit> . first, oligosaccharides are synthesised within the cytoplasm. second, repeating units of oligosaccharides are assembled and attached to a lipid carrier by glycosyltransferases. finally, repeating units are polymerised and translocated out of the cell. this final step is carried out by one of three main systems: the wzy-dependent, atp-binding cassette -dependent and synthase dependent pathways  <cit> .

in the wzy-dependent pathway, lipid linked oligosaccharide units are translocated from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by wzx where they are polymerised by wzy. export then occurs via the transmembrane polysaccharide co-polymerase  wzc and outer membrane transporter  wza. two gene clusters in p. priestleyi bc <dig> followed the scheme for a wzy-dependent eps export system, one on contig ga0079976_ <dig> and a second on ga0079976_ <dig> . both clusters included genes containing domains that are conserved in the genes wza, wzc, wzx, and wzy. in both clusters, wza and wzc were adjacent to each other, while the arrangement of the remainder of associated genes differed considerably. both clusters included genes containing domains involved in biosynthesis  and assembly . two genes in the cluster on contig ga0079976_ <dig> are putatively annotated as exotosins, the glucuronosyltransferase domain of which has been shown to be homologous to the mur <dig> gene in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . mur <dig> is responsible for modification of xyloglucans  and the genes found here may encode proteins responsible for similar functions that contribute to the structure of the eps matrix.fig.  <dig> gene diagrams of putative a) wzy- and b) abc-dependent clusters in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  schematics of the organisation of proteins within the cell membrane are shown 



in the abc-dependent pathway, polymerisation occurs in the cytoplasm and the abc-transporter kpstm transfers assembled polysaccharides across the cytoplasmic membrane, before they are exported from the cell by the pcp/opx proteins kpsd and kpse. two clusters in p. priestleyi bc <dig> contained components for the abc-dependent pathway . gene clusters on contigs ga0079976_ <dig> and ga0079976_ <dig> contain genes with domains found in kpsd, kpse, kpsm and kpst. on contig ga0079976_ <dig>  kpsm was annotated as two smaller genes and all of the kps_ genes were clustered close together, whereas on ga0079976_ <dig> kpsd and kpse were located ~80kbp upstream of the kpsm and kpst homologues. as with the wzy-dependent clusters, several biosynthetic and assembly genes were also present, suggesting relatively self-contained modules for eps synthesis and export in p. priestleyi bc <dig> 

in the synthase-dependent pathway, a single protein, alg <dig>  carries out synthesis, polymerisation and translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. export is via an outer membrane porin, alge which is scaffolded to the membrane by algk. despite several alg <dig> homologs being found in the genome, no clear synthase-dependent pathways were identified in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  this is consistent with the findings of peireira et al.  <cit>  who were unable to confidently identify key components of the synthase-dependent pathway throughout the entire phylum of cyanobacteria.

out of the known prokaryotic eps export pathways p. priestleyi bc <dig> contained two wzy- and two abc-dependent gene clusters and no complete synthase dependent gene clusters, similar to many other cyanobacteria irrespective of the environment  <cit> . despite the importance of eps production for survival in cold environments, there was no indication that the genome of p. priestleyi bc <dig> had any relative increase in eps related genes. eps genes are contained within the cluster of orthologous genes  category ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’. a total of  <dig> genes representing  <dig>  % of the p. priestleyi bc <dig> genome were included in the ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ category  compared to  <dig>  % in l. boryana pcc  <dig>   <dig>  % in oscillatoriales cyanobacterium jsc- <dig> and  <dig>  % in geitlerinema sp. pcc  <dig>  peireira et al.  <cit>  indicated that genome size rather than habitat had the largest effect on number of eps related genes. p. priestleyi bc <dig> appears to be no exception to this with the number of ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ genes falling well within the expected distribution of genomes that size .fig.  <dig> plots showing proportion of genes involved in cog category ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  l. boryana pcc  <dig>  oscillatoriales cyanobacterium jsc- <dig> and geitlerinema sp. pcc  <dig>  a proportion of all cogs, ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ is highlighted and b) the number of ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ genes compared to genome size in the context of  <dig> other cyanobacterial genomes publicly available on jgi img/er



environmental sensing
while it is clear that many cyanobacteria produce epss, the way in which eps production is regulated in cyanobacteria is not yet understood. the bacterial second messenger bis -cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate  has been implicated in a large number of signalling pathways related to eps biosynthesis and biofilm formation  <cit> . it is synthesised by proteins containing the conserved ggdef/ggeef domain and binds to a wide variety of cellular receptors, which are normally proteins containing pilz domains. synthesis of c-di-gmp can be regulated by the wsp system , a chemosensory pathway thought to modulate c-di-gmp levels in response to surface adhesion causing biofilm formation and a transition from motile to sessile lifestyle . a nearly complete cassette for the wsp chemosensory pathway was found in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  located on contig ga0079976_ <dig> . a gene for a cyclic nucleotide binding protein is followed on the forward strand by wspb, wspc, wspa, wspd, wspe, wspf. in the position normally occupied by the response regulator wspr was a class  <dig> adenylate cyaclase. whereas wspr is a ggdef/ggeef domain containing diguanylate cyclase, class  <dig> adenylate cyclases are cyclase homology domain containing mononucleotidyl cyclases. searches for ggdef/ggeef pfam domains within the p. priestleyi bc <dig> genome revealed six potential wspr homologues. in-silico modelling of their structures using phyre <dig> revealed two proteins featuring homology to wspr with 100 % confidence over an alignment length of >90 % . one of these is a single gene on contig ga0079976_ <dig> and the second is on contig ga0079976_ <dig>  a further five genes contained ggdef/ggeef domains but showed low sequence similarity for the remainder of the protein .fig.  <dig> gene diagrams of putative wsp-chemosensory system in p. priestleyi bc <dig>  schematics of the organisation of proteins within the cell membrane are shown 

putative wspr homologues are marked with a


fig.  <dig> alignment of two putative wspr homologues in p. priestleyi bc <dig> with the wspr of pseudomonas fluorescens. the ggdef/ggeef domain is highlighted in red




for a standard wspr regulated wsp-system to influence eps production and biofilm formation, a receptor must exist for synthesised c-di-gmp. somewhat unexpectedly, genes containing the typical c-di-gmp binding pilz domains were apparently absent from the p. priestleyi bc <dig> draft genome. blast searches for homologues of the gene for alg <dig>  the c-di-gmp binding component of the absent synthase dependent pathway, revealed  <dig> genes that shared the hlyd domain of alg <dig> while the pilz domain appeared to be missing . five of these were clustered together with abc-transporter genes; one such cluster was homologous to devbca, the efflux transporter responsible for formation of the heterocyst envelope in diazotrophic cyanobacteria  <cit> . it should be stressed that abc-transporters are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes and are not necessarily linked to eps. other genes have also been implicated in c-di-gmp binding. for example, non-enzymatic ggdef/ggeef domains  have also been shown to operate as c-di-gmp effectors  <cit> . at least one such protein may exist in p. priestleyi bc <dig> where a ggdef/ggeef domain was identified but the ggdef/ggeef motif itself was absent . however, despite the clear existence of a well-defined wsp-like chemosensory system, the exact nature of the system’s response regulators and effectors remain unclear. the close blast similarity of wsp genes in p. priestleyi bc <dig> to those in several other cyanobacteria suggest that this may be an important pathway across the cyanobacteria and warrants further investigation if we are to understand the way in which cyanobacteria interact with their environment.table  <dig> locations of putative alg <dig> homologues lacking pilz domains in the p. priestleyi bc <dig> draft genome

the mechanisms of eps production and regulation described here are by no means unique to p. priestleyi bc <dig> and can be found throughout the cyanobacterial phylum  <cit> . however, they are also not ubiquitous and lineage specific characteristics may mean that certain cyanobacteria are predisposed to exploit certain environments or interact with their environment in particular ways. for example, the wsp system is not present in all cyanobacteria, being identified in l. boryana pcc  <dig> and geitlerinema sp. pcc  <dig> but not in oscillatoriales cyanobacterium jsc- <dig>  this implies that closely related lineages may interact with their environment in very different ways. in terms of p. priestleyi bc <dig>  the presence of the wsp system may have considerable implications for the mechanisms of cryoconite formation. physical contact of the cell surface of p. priestleyi with particulate matter may result in the activation of biofilm formation and eps production mechanisms, thus initiating the first stages of cryoconite aggregation. further investigation into the regulation and expression of this and the eps production mechanisms will help us to understand how cyanobacteria influence ice sheet surfaces.

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented here represents a first step in understanding the molecular underpinnings of adaptation of cyanobacteria to cold environments and raises many questions. the arctic cyanobacterium p. priestleyi bc <dig> is closely related to the antarctic p. priestleyi based upon ssu similarity and likely represents a cryosphere specific lineage. a standard complement of cold shock genes and a lack of cold biased molecular evolution, as has been seen in other prokaryotes, suggests that p. priestleyi bc <dig> does not require these characteristics to tolerate survival in cold environments. instead, it is likely that the production of epss buffers it from the extreme conditions that it experiences. why p. priestleyi is found in the cryosphere while closely related lineages bearing similar genome characteristics are not is not yet known. this is intriguing since the eps synthesis and export mechanisms in p. priestleyi bc <dig> appear to follow the same scheme that has been reported from throughout the cyanobacterial phylum. any differences may then be a result of regulation and differential expression under the conditions experienced in cold environments. as a result, future work should include targeted transcriptomics to understand how these genes are expressed and what implications that may have for both the organism and the environment it inhabits. furthermore, the wsp chemosensory pathway represents a possible link between the environment and production of eps and understanding how this operates in p. priestleyi bc <dig> may help us to better understand the principles of cryoconite formation.
