BACKGROUND
epigenetics refers to mitotically and meiotically heritable variation in gene regulation and function that cannot be accounted for by changes in dna sequence but rather results from enzyme-mediated chemical modifications to dna and its associated chromatin proteins  <cit> . over the last decade, epigenetic research has focused mainly on mammals, whereas plants have received less attention, although there is a fair amount of information on certain plant models such as arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> .

whereas methylation in animal genomes occurs mostly in regulatory regions, methylation in arabidopsis is found in transcribed sequences, not only at canonical cg sites but also at cng  and cnn  sites. the latter sites are preferentially methylated in repetitive elements and transposons  <cit> .

it has been well established through chemical analyses on mutants that met <dig>  the orthologous enzyme to mammalian dnmt <dig> , maintains dna methylation at cg sites  <cit> . on the other hand, the plant-specific methyltransferase cmt <dig> maintains dna methylation at cng sites  <cit>  while at the same time cross-talking with the histone h <dig> methyltransferase kyp  <cit> . finally, the third type of plant cytosine methylation  was demonstrated by pioneer mutant analysis to arise due to the methylase drm <dig>  <cit> , a homologue of the mammalian de novo methyltransferase dnmt <dig>  drm <dig>  together with endogenous small interfering rnas, also maintains dna methylation at cnn sites  <cit> , a less-studied epigenetic modification.

our studies focused on the tomato plant , an edible plant crop  of great economic importance with a genome that is almost  <dig> times larger than that of arabidopsis and of which there have been few epigenetics studies  <cit> . using this model system, we investigated cytosine methylation status in different contexts and the intragenic distribution of cytosine methylation in asr <dig>  a non-transposon, protein-coding, water stress-inducible gene of the lea superfamily  <cit>  that is conserved in the plant kingdom but lacks an orthologous counterpart in arabidopsis. this gene has been extensively studied by us and other groups at the dna  <cit> , rna  <cit>  and protein  <cit>  levels and in terms of physiological function  <cit>  and evolution  <cit> . this  <dig> -bp gene has a very simple organisation, consisting of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> nt, respectively, separated by an intron of  <dig> nt. we chose the leaf as the source of genomic dna because it is the organ in which asr <dig> expression is the greatest upon water stress  <cit> .

a second aspect of our work dealt with the intriguing link between epigenetics and stress in plants  <cit> . stress-induced physiological responses in arabidopsis are thought to depend on altered dna methylation  <cit> . to test this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the gain and loss of cytosine methylation marks on our model gene as a consequence of imposing water stress conditions on tomato plants.

RESULTS
overall non-cg methylation in the tomato genome
to explore the general features of methylation in tomato leaf dna, we first observed a panoramic view of both cg and cng methylation using several restriction enzymes. comparisons between methylation-sensitive and -insensitive enzymes provided an evaluation of the overall cg methylation. this low-resolution but illustrative analysis  displayed a pronounced level of typical cg methylation and a noticeable degree of overall cng methylation , a modification that is typically, though not exclusively, associated with repeated and/or transposable elements.

non-cg methylation in the asr <dig> gene body
motivated by the results described above, we wanted to gain insight into methylation events in cytosine contexts other than the well-known cpg. for that purpose, we performed a closer inspection of asr <dig> in the leaf.

for this analysis, we used the bisulphite procedure  <cit> , which allows a higher resolution as it is able to detect all cytosine residues , not just the residues within a site recognised by a restriction enzyme. after pooling the data for each methylation type and grouping by gene region , we concluded that there are significant levels of the three types of methylation  under non-water stress conditions. we were surprised to detect cnn, as asr <dig> is a non-transposon gene bearing no repetitive elements and hence constitutes a novel location for this type of methylation site. in this case, cnn turned out to be concentrated preferentially in the intron.

to address methodological concerns, we performed parallel bisulphite reactions on non-methylated or in vitro methylated plasmid dna and obtained expected outcomes . in addition, we ruled out unintentional overestimation of cytosine methylation due to an eventual inefficient bisulphite conversion by using primers that were specifically designed to amplify the converted template and were incapable of annealing to the natural template. furthermore, there is no reason to believe that some cytosine residues  were in fact converted while others in the same pure dna sample were not.

cnn demethylation upon water stress
to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of plants to abiotic stress, we tested the hypothesis that stress-induced phenotypes depend on epigenetic changes. with that goal in mind, a similar type of experimental analysis was performed on leaf dna after imposing water-shortage stress on whole tomato plants through root drying. we found that drought-simulated conditions brought about methylation at cg sites in exon  <dig>  and simultaneous removal of methyl marks at  <dig> of the  <dig> asymmetric  sites analysed. this demethylation scenario was statistically significant throughout the gene body as follows: exon  <dig> , intron  and exon  <dig>  .

these results are in agreement with the methylation status data obtained by direct  sequencing of the asr <dig> pcr product after bisulphite treatment of the genomic dna .

it is worth noting that clones with dissimilar patterns may have arisen from different cell types  together in the leaf samples under examination, each displaying a distinct epigenetic behaviour.

with the intention of further validating the bisulphite methodology, we measured the extent of methylation at a single ccgg site  by methylation-sensitive and -insensitive restriction enzymes; the chosen site was c32c33gg, belonging to exon  <dig>  the result  is in agreement with that obtained with bisulphite for those particular cytosine residues for both basal and stress conditions .

at this point, it is pertinent to clarify that the methylation trends shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> reflect an average behaviour of all cytosine positions grouped in each gene region and thus may not necessarily match the epigenetic situation of individual cytosine residues like those depicted in figure  <dig> 

as gene expression could be regulated also by post-translational histone modifications, which, in turn, may interact with the methylation of cytosines, we decided to explore h3k27me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  abundant histone marks in arabidopsis  <cit> . we found the expression level of gene asr <dig> tightly associated with h3k27me <dig>  a major repressive mark for gene expression. such a covalent modification quantitatively appeared to decrease with water stress  . in contrast, h3k4me <dig>  a mark distinctive of gene activation, was not significantly detected under any condition in the context of asr <dig> .

asr induction upon water stress
to identify an eventual correlation between any type of methylation  and expression of our model gene, we performed qrt-pcr for both basal and stress conditions. the results  indicate a 7-fold induction of asr <dig> leaf mrna levels after  <dig> hours of water stress, reaching a robust 36-fold induction at  <dig> hours, the time point at which the marked wilting phenotypes observed in the roots and leaves were still reversible .

discussion
the typical cg methylation within promoter regions observed in animal genomes has also been recognised in certain plant loci  <cit> . however, epigenome-wide surveys in arabidopsis have revealed that transcribed regions are also capable of being methylated, but to a lesser extent compared to transposons, and methylation is limited to cg sites  <cit> . one such example comes from a study with petunia showing that a class-c floral homeotic gene was expressed following transgene-induced rna-directed dna methylation  at cg sites in an intron  <cit> , which also revealed that dna methylation in gene bodies is not necessarily associated with silencing as it is in animals. another similar example was reported by zhang et al.  <cit> , who found that many housekeeping genes were methylated in coding regions and actually showed a higher level of expression. in accordance with these data, we found stress-provoked higher cg methylation levels in the first exon of our model gene, concomitantly with enhanced gene expression.

on the other hand, evidence of non-cg methylation in tandem repeats has been accrued by the jacobsen group  <cit>  along with its conservation across duplicated regions of the genome  <cit> . in our work, we detected extensive asymmetric cnn methylation in a novel location: a non-repeat transcribed region. in addition, we found that such an epigenetic modification correlated with poor expression, consistent with older work  <cit> . similarly, a null drm <dig> mutant was reported to block non-cg methylation, which allowed for full desilencing of the fwa gene, resulting in a late-flowering phenotype  <cit> .

current models propose that methyl-cytosine-binding proteins, through their sra  domains, link dna and histone methylation events  <cit> . indeed, dna methylation can induce chromatin remodelling by recruiting methylcytosine-binding proteins such as kyp, a h3k <dig> methyltransferase, and vim <dig>  which in turn induce heterochromatinisation  <cit> . self-enforcement of cnn methylation by drm <dig> is also mediated by suvh <dig>  which has no detectable histone methyltransferase activity but binds methylated cnn sites, thus facilitating further access for drm <dig> to methylated regions  <cit> .

it seems significant that cytosine methylation in the bodies of protein-coding genes may be lost at high frequency in successive generations  <cit> , which is in agreement with our results showing a heterogeneous population of epialleles in basal conditions. a similar scenario of variation has also been found for naturally repeated rna genes  <cit> .

interestingly, intragenic dna methylation mechanisms are emerging as essential modifications, as they regulate gene expression and plant development  <cit> , but how those mechanisms operate remains an important question. one example of the existence of additional molecular players is provided by genetic evidence that a particular arabidopsis mutant undergoes ectopic deposition of cng methylation in thousands of genes  <cit> . these data suggest that there is a set of as-yet-unexplored, genome-protecting factors that play a role in blocking methyltransferases from modifying gene regions containing non-cg sites that may include cnn sites.

at this point, it is worth mentioning that, to the best of our knowledge, conclusions as to the assignment of different plant methylases to particular substrate sites have been derived solely through reverse genetics by analysing mutants  <cit>  and not from in vitro experiments with purified enzymes. a biochemical approach to do so does not yet exist but, if developed, would convincingly validate current hypotheses. moreover, biochemistry would help to elaborate new models needed to understand the in vivo maintenance of cnn methylation during dna replication, which is difficult to envisage, as there are no local cytosine residues to be methylated in the nascent complementary strand.

as far as the appealing connection between plant epigenetics and stress is concerned, our findings in the tomato plant are consistent with the hypothesis highlighted by the kovalchuk group  <cit>  in arabidopsis, and experimentally supported in rice  <cit> , that at least some stress-induced phenotypes depend on altered dna methylation.

regarding chromatin architecture, it is not surprising that h3k27me <dig> resulted in association with the expression level of gene asr <dig> in basal conditions rather than under stress, since it is a major repressive mark, at least in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in conclusion, the data presented here show a novel location for cnn methylation in plants, namely in the body of a model gene with no repeated sequences that is regulated by water stress. these findings may represent an alternative and general mechanism for the stress-driven gain or loss of epigenetic marks that regulate gene expression in plants other than arabidopsis, which have larger and more complex genomes. the rapid appearance of these newly acquired epialleles in the affected somatic cells, coupled with the unique ability of plants to produce germline cells late during development, may allow its inheritance across generations  <cit>  and eventual positive selection, thus contributing to adaptive evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
1) there is a noticeable degree of overall cng methylation in the solanum lycopersicum genome, a modification that is typically, though not exclusively, associated with repeated and/or transposable elements.

2) we found a heterogeneous population of epialleles in the asr <dig> gene under both basal and water stress conditions.

3) we detected an extensive asymmetric cnn methylation in a novel location: a transcribed region of a protein-coding, non-repetitive gene, correlating with poor expression.

4) drought conditions brought about higher cg methylation levels in the first exon of our model gene and removal of methyl marks at cnn sites, mostly in the intronic region, concomitantly with enhanced expression of this gene.

5) drought conditions caused a decrease of h3k27me <dig> in the context of our model gene, concurrently with enhanced expression of this gene.
