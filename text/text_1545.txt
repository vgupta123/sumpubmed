BACKGROUND
members of the rootless genus utricularia  are the most versatile and cosmopolitan among carnivorous plants, exhibiting great morphological and ecophysiological plasticity  <cit> . approximately  <dig> species of utricularia are aquatic or amphibious, growing in standing, nutrient-poor humic waters. while their ecology and carnivorous habit have been researched previously  <cit> , increasing attention has been given to the peculiarities of utricularia genomes - miniature size in many species within the family  <cit> , highly increased nucleotide substitution rates across the genomes of all three cellular compartments: mitochondrial, plastid, and nuclear  <cit> , and to the extremely dynamic evolution of genome size at the level of species or even single populations  <cit> . utricularia gibba possesses one of the smallest haploid angiosperm genomes known, approximately one-half that of arabidopsis thaliana, with chromosomes of bacterial size  <cit> . u. gibba was the subject of the first broad survey of nuclear gene transcripts in utricularia species  <cit> , revealing several interesting aspects of their physiology and morphology. supporting physiological data, the global transcript analysis revealed specific expression patterns of genes involved in respiration, dna repair, ros detoxification, and nutrient uptake in different plant tissues. the sequencing and analysis of the u. gibba genome  <cit>  additionally revealed a compressed genome architecture with highly reduced intergenic regions and nearly free of retrotransposons.

utricularia spp. have since been identified as prime candidates for further research on the complexities of plant ecophysiology associated with carnivory, metagenomic surveys of trap microbial communities, novel plant nitrogen/nutrient utilization pathways, the ecology of prey attraction, whole-plant and trap comparative development, and the evolution of a minimalist angiosperm genome  <cit> . utricularia gibba, however, is not a good candidate species for many ecological and physiological experiments due to its minute size and extremely small traps. we have therefore chosen the ecologically well-characterized temperate utricularia vulgaris  <cit>  as our model for a broad transcriptome analysis. its ecophysiology is subtly but meaningfully distinct from that of u. gibba, offering the possibility for a comprehensive comparison of genome-wide expression patterns between the two species.

in this study, we report the results of  <dig> gs-flx titanium sequencing of a polya-selected and normalized cdna library from u. vulgaris, derived from a pooled sample of multiple tissue types, including functional annotation of expressed gene content. we compared this transcriptome to the u. gibba transcriptome  <cit>  and showed that, despite different methods of preparation and tissue composition, the overall gene expression pattern and gene distribution among go categories were very similar between the two species. we also analysed several cases of alternative splicing  in the u. vulgaris transcriptome, including a gene for which this post-transcriptional process has not been investigated in any plant species.

although any transcriptome should be viewed as incomplete, it may serve as an acceptable proxy for the genome in a species without complete genomic information, such as u. vulgaris, provided that it is prepared from multiple tissues and various environmental conditions  <cit> . we demonstrate the usefulness of the u. vulgaris transcriptome for the identification of gene losses and duplications during the course of evolution of the genus utricularia.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly
in total,  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing of the u. vulgaris normalized cdna library,  <dig> , <dig> of them passed built-in quality filtering.  <dig> % of the initial, raw reads were assembled by newbler  <dig>  and produced  <dig>  isogroups containing  <dig>  isotigs, roughly corresponding to the individual transcripts. in addition,  <dig>  singletons longer than 100 nt were obtained. isotigs and singletons were combined together into a unique transcript  data set representing the u. vulgaris transcriptome. to facilitate the comparison between our data and the u. gibba transcriptome published by  <cit> , raw reads of u. gibba were downloaded from dna data bank of japan  under the submission sra <dig> and assembled by newbler  <dig>  using the same parameters as adopted for the u. vulgaris transcriptome . table  <dig> compares the transcriptome assemblies of the two species. our u. vulgaris data set consisted of nearly twice as many raw reads, a higher proportion of which assembled into contigs, than the u. gibba dataset. the u. vulgaris assembly also resulted in a higher number of isogroups and much higher  number of isotigs. furthermore, our u. vulgaris assembly produced only  <dig>  singletons compared to the  <dig>  singletons remaining after de novo u. gibba assembly. the u. vulgaris data set contained about  <dig>  isotigs per isogroup, whereas only  <dig>  isotigs per isogroup, on average, were found in the u. gibba assembly. the much higher number of isotigs in the u. vulgaris transcriptome, both relative  and absolute, was at least partly caused by the method of cdna library preparation. our u. vulgaris cdna library was normalized, increasing the number of rare transcripts represented by isotigs.table  <dig>

of the total  <dig>  u. vulgaris singletons,  <dig>   gave a significant blast hit against the ncbi nr protein database under the same parameters as used for isotigs.  <dig>  singletons  were successfully annotated and  <dig>  singletons  were assigned with e.c. the average level of annotations in go hierarchy was  <dig> . the total number of assigned gene ontology terms was  <dig> . the much lower proportion of u. vulgaris singletons yielding significant blast hits, compared with the isotigs, may be due to their short sizes and also due to the presence of transcripts derived from microbes without any ncbi record.

the results of the go annotations of the ut_u.gibba transcriptome are given in table  <dig>  the proportion of annotated isotigs is a bit lower and the proportion of annotated singletons is a bit higher in u. gibba than in u. vulgaris. this difference results from a higher amount of unassembled reads in ut_u.gibba relative to ut_u.vulgaris. the proportion of isotigs with an assigned e.c. was also higher in u. vulgaris than in u. gibba.

despite of the differences in cultivation conditions, plant tissues used for rna extraction, cdna library preparation and assembly parameters, the general partition of isotigs into basic kegg categories was very similar between the two utricularia species . “catalytic activity” and “binding” were the prevalent categories among molecular function. “cell” and “organelle” dominated in the cellular component section. abundant categories “metabolic process” and “cellular” were followed by slightly less numerous categories “response to stimulus” and “biological regulation”. the high representation of the “single-organism process” category appeared due to co-existing microbes.figure  <dig>

we summarized the results of our u. vulgaris transcriptome assembly and annotation and created a web-accessible database  which can be easily searched by blast or annotation.

the composition of transcriptomes
more than 99% of the isotigs with significant hits were assigned by megan to plants  in both u. vulgaris and u. gibba. all remaining isotigs  belonged to fungi, metazoa, unicellular eukaryotes, and prokaryotes . the taxonomic diversity of singletons was much higher:  <dig> % and  <dig> % of singletons with significant hits were assigned outside the streptophytes in u. vulgaris, and u. gibba, respectively . the non-plant sequences were mostly derived from microbial commensals, as well as a minor fraction from animal  rna contamination. the very low proportion of prokaryotic sequences was due to the polya+ rna used to prepare cdna. as prokaryotic mrnas rarely contain polya+ tails, they were mostly eliminated. the proportion of non-plant transcripts is probably higher among singletons, because many of them may not have produced statistically significant hits due to incomplete microbial records in public databases. the abundance of microbe-derived transcripts was higher in the u. gibba transcriptome prepared only from plants grown under natural conditions and colonized with microbes. in contrast, the u. vulgaris transcriptome was constructed from a pooled rna sample prepared from the plants cultivated under both sterile and non-sterile conditions.figure  <dig>

large isogroups and alternative splicing
the isogroups containing numerous isotigs may include transcripts derived from several or many loci, e.g. retroposons, or from transcripts undergoing as  <cit> . the u. vulgaris transcriptome contained six isogroups with >  <dig> isotigs,  <dig> isogroups with >  <dig> isotigs, and  <dig> isogroups with >  <dig> isotigs. the largest, isogroup  <dig> in u.vulgaris, included  <dig> isotigs derived from various members of a large beta glucosidase gene family.

in contrast, the u. gibba assembly contained zero isogroups with >  <dig> isotigs, only two isogroups with >  <dig> isotigs, and  <dig> isogroups with >  <dig> isotigs . the main reason for such a high difference in the number of large isogroups with many isotigs between the ut_u.vulgaris and ut_u.gibba transcriptome assemblies seems to be the method of cdna preparation. normalization of the cdna library led to the enrichment of rare transcripts in u. vulgaris, including alternatively spliced mrnas. the largest isogroup in the ut_u.gibba assembly, which was generated without a cdna normalization step, contained only  <dig> isotigs, representing transcripts coding for the small subunit of rubisco, the most abundant protein on earth. when read counts are extremely high, as in the case of rubisco, sequencing errors occur in multiple reads which are then assembled into separate, artifactual contigs. some large isogroups in u. gibba also represented transcripts derived from multiple loci-e.g. isogroup  <dig>   <cit>  or the isogroups  <dig> and  <dig>  which gave no hits in blast searches of ncbi databases, but yielded multiple hits against the u. gibba genome draft .

alternative splicing appears to be the main reason for the transcript abundance and diversity in many of the largest isogroups in u. vulgaris and in u. gibba. these isotigs contain contigs corresponding to arabidopsis exons and also numerous contigs which may be assigned to introns based on their position between two exons. additional file  <dig> compares the  <dig> and  <dig> largest isogroups of u. vulgaris and u. gibba, respectively. they represent various genes or gene families belonging to similar structure and function categories.

only one large isogroup  appears to be the same in both utricularia species. it encodes a family of atp dependent rna helicases. its arabidopsis homologs  are involved in a wide range of rna metabolism including pre-mrna splicing, mrna transport, turnover, translation initiation etc.  <cit> . they undergo as, as documented by genome-wide analysis of transcript variants  <cit> . five contigs of the isogroup  <dig> in u. vulgaris match arabidopsis exons, suggesting extensive as of transcripts derived from at least two related genes. the more than four fold higher isotig count of the  <dig> isogroup in u. vulgaris than in u. gibba may again reflect a significant enrichment in rare transcripts due to cdna normalization of u. vulgaris transcriptome, or reflect a lower extent of as in u. gibba. three other isogroups of u. vulgaris could participate in the control of as, including the isogroup  <dig>  encoding a homolog of afc <dig> protein kinase, which underwent extreme as  in arabidopsis  <cit> . the remaining large isogroups with as code for membrane proteins with multiple domains, proteins involved in protein degradation, or fulfilling regulatory functions. two large isogroups  were assigned to retroposons in the u. vulgaris transcriptome. no large isogroup corresponding to transposons or retroposons was found in the u. gibba transcriptome, however three single isotigs were.

two isogroups with extreme alternative splicing
we selected two isogroups of u. vulgaris with very high isotig counts for more detailed analysis. after aligning all  <dig> isotigs of the isogroup  <dig>  we found that all of them were derived from the same locus, because only one sequence variant  corresponded to each exon of the homologous arabidopsis gene, at1g <dig>  coding for sphingoid long-chain base 1-phosphate lyase  . we assigned eight contigs to eight introns based on a comparison with the homologous arabidopsis gene. the retention of variable numbers of introns was responsible for the observed extreme as in this isogroup. only one isotig  <dig> contained the correct orf with genetic information for a functional protein. to confirm as experimentally, we designed primers targeted to exon  <dig> or intron  <dig>  and exon  <dig>  and ran pcr . the size of pcr fragment generated from genomic dna  with exon-specific primers uv405_f <dig> and uv405_r <dig> agreed with the expected size of this genomic region . the amplification of cdna produced a strong band  corresponding to correctly spliced mrna with no introns  and several weak upper bands most likely derived from partially spliced mrna with retained introns. the primers spanning from intron  <dig> to exon  <dig>  produced a pcr fragment from genomic dna as well as one strong band  and a few weaker ones from cdna. the strong band amplified from cdna provided evidence for intron  <dig> retention, because no amplification with this primer pair could occur if only correctly spliced mrna were present in the transcript pool.figure  <dig>

to achieve the correct assembly of alternative transcripts in a species without reference genome is very difficult. it becomes even more challenging if multiple similar paralogous genes are transcribed and alternatively spliced. in such cases, chimeric misassembled contigs are frequently generated  <cit> . the isogroup  <dig> homologous to the ethylene insensitive  <dig> ein <dig> gene  in arabidopsis is an example of the mixture of alternatively spliced transcripts derived from at least two loci. we identified contigs corresponding to the exons and introns of the ein <dig> gene. several putative exons existed in two sequence variants and occurred in chimeric isotigs. we confirmed the occurrence of two ein <dig> gene copies by direct sequencing of u. vulgaris genomic dna. we designed two primer pairs uv304_f <dig>  r <dig> and uv308_f <dig>  r <dig>  and amplified and sequenced a part of exon  <dig> from both ein <dig> paralogs. the alignment  of u. vulgaris sequences with ein <dig> homologs across angiosperms was used in phylogenetic analysis to generate mp and ml trees . the trees constructed by both methods showed the same topology and confirmed a relatively recent duplication of ein <dig>  preceding the divergence of u. vulgaris and u. gibba. we found only one ein <dig> homolog in the u. gibba genome .figure  <dig>

the ratio of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions  in the pairwise comparison between ein2- <dig> and ein2- <dig> of u. vulgaris was  <dig> , between ein <dig> of u. vulgaris and ein <dig> of u. gibba was  <dig>  . the data suggest no variation in evolutionary constraints.

putative orthologs between u. vulgaris and u. gibba
we performed a reciprocal blast hit search to identify putative orthologs between the ut_u.vulgaris transcriptome and a 19475-mrna database derived from the genomic draft of u. gibba, which represents an in silico transcriptome of this species. we chose the u. gibba transcriptome derived from a genomic draft, because it supposedly represented more complete set of transcripts than the experimental transcriptome ut_u. gibba.

we identified  <dig>  putative orthologous pairs,  <dig>  of them contained u. vulgaris isotigs and the remaining  <dig>  pairs contained u. vulgaris singletons. the orthologs represented about  <dig> % of all genes annotated in the u. gibba genomic draft. we ordered putative orthologous pairs between u. gibba and u. vulgaris according to the sequence similarity of the regions aligned by blast. the distribution of orthologs assigned to individual similarity classes is shown in figure  <dig>  most orthologous pairs exhibited a sequence similarity of 85%-90%, whether or not they included u. vulgaris isotigs or singletons. singletons are much shorter than an average isotig , thus they often represent incomplete transcripts. their sequence similarity depends on whether they are derived from a more or less conserved part of the gene, it does not reflect the similarity across an entire gene. for this reason, we performed the following analyses of the most conserved orthologs with the pairs containing only u. vulgaris isotigs, not singletons.figure  <dig>

because the overall sequence similarity of putative u. vulgaris-u. gibba orthologs was rather low , we investigated which go categories were enriched among the most conserved orthologous pairs. go enrichment   <cit>  analysis of the most conserved orthologs  against all orthologs identified  <dig> significantly enriched go categories . they belonged to the genes encoding proteins conserved across all angiosperms . their proportion in respective similarity classes of putative orthologs increased with increasing sequence similarity . detailed inspection of go categories enriched among highly conserved orthologs between u. gibba and u. vulgaris revealed genes which were less similar to their arabidopsis counterparts than the rest of the highly conserved orthologs, namely myosin xi b  and tip growth defective  <dig>  . interestingly, both genes play a role in root hair development in arabidopsis. as neither u. gibba nor u. vulgaris produce roots, it is probable that the two genes have gained a novel or modified functions in utricularia, explaining why their sequences are highly similar between both utricularia species, but less similar to arabidopsis homologs.figure  <dig>

root-specific genes in rootless utricularia
as utricularia vulgaris does not form roots, some of the genes involved in root development and function might have been lost. ibarra-laclette et al.  <cit>  published a list of the genes associated with root in a. thaliana, but not found in the genome of u. gibba. they include myb transcription factors, mads box genes, cell-wall-associated kinases, nitrate transporter etc. . we selected the root-associated genes absent in u. gibba, supplemented additional genes exclusively or predominantly expressed in the roots of a. thaliana and checked their presence among putative orthologs identified by blastx-tblastn reciprocal blast search between a. thaliana protein data set  and the ut_u.vulgaris transcriptome. we found a strong correspondence between the absence of particular genes in the u. gibba genome  <cit>  and their absence in the u. vulgaris transcriptome . moreover, we did not find the counterparts of additional arabidopsis root-associated genes in the u. vulgaris transcriptome, notably transcription factors involved in root hair  or root cap development . these genes were also missing in the u. gibba genome . on the other hand, some genes such as auxin response factor  <dig>  or indole-3-acetic acid inducible  genes found putative orthologs in both the u. vulgaris transcriptome and the u. gibba genome . six of  <dig> u. vulgaris root-associated genes  under study contained complete orfs, the rest of isotigs represented partial sequences, which reflected an overall incompleteness of experimental transcriptomes.

because the transcriptomes are incomplete, the absence of an ortholog in the transcriptome, by itself, is not the evidence of its absence in the corresponding genome. thus, we may not exclude the possibility that the absence of any respective gene in the u. vulgaris transcriptome was caused by its low or missing transcription. however, the coincident absence of  <dig> root-associated genes and concordant presence of  <dig> root-associated genes in the u. vulgaris transcriptome and the u. gibba genome suggest that, at least in the case of root genes, the ut_u.vulgaris transcriptome reflects the gene content of the u. vulgaris genome.

interestingly, two copies of the gene auxin response factor  <dig> , duplicated in the u. gibba genome  <cit> , were also found in the u. vulgaris transcriptome. the full agreement between the sets of root-associated genes lost in u. gibba and u. vulgaris and the concordance of the genes duplicated in both species support the notion that deletions and duplications of genes involved in root-associated genes occurred before the divergence of the two utricularia species.

discussion
transcriptome comparison
recent progress in next generation sequencing makes it possible to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of non-model plants to an unprecedented extent. the  <dig> plants  initiative  is just one example of current efforts. the genomic draft of u. gibba  <cit>  has attracted attention because it represents one of the smallest genomes in the plant kingdom and opened the possibility to study the mechanisms responsible for genome contraction in plants. the availability of a sequenced genome and an experimental transcriptome of u. gibba generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing from various organs  <cit> , made u. gibba a suitable species for comparative transcriptomics in utricularia. we chose a temperate congener u. vulgaris as a counterpart for comparison. both species share an aquatic carnivorous life style, lack of roots, and display rapid apical shoot growth, but exhibit partly distinct ecophysiology .

the distribution of go categories in utricularia was also in line with previously published transcriptomic data from carnivorous species of sarracenia  <cit> . this study used only a quarter of the data of the u. vulgaris transcriptome, without pooling various tissues or developmental stages. despite methodological differences, the proportions of go categories were very similar between u. vulgaris and sarracenia. only the categories “response to stimulus” and “biological regulation” were much higher in utricularia than recorded for sarracenia. this difference may reflect distinct life styles of both carnivorous genera. whereas sarracenia is a robust slowly growing terrestrial perennial plant, utricularia is a fast growing aquatic plant which has to cope with sudden changes of environment . alternatively, the impact of very different data sets cannot be excluded. in this case, it would affect only the two go categories, which appears unlikely.

examples of alternative splicing
normalization of cdna is recommended for the study of as, because it increases the proportion of rare mrnas, often represented by alternatively spliced transcripts. this approach revealed that  <dig> % of intron-containing genes were alternatively spliced in arabidopsis  <cit> . we cannot directly compare the extent of as in u. vulgaris and arabidopsis, because missing genomic information in u. vulgaris prevents the accurate assignment of splice variants. however,  <dig> largest isogroups in u. vulgaris  matched arabidopsis homologs with more than  <dig> splice variants belonging to 25% of the genes with the highest level of as in arabidopsis  <cit> , which suggests that a similar set of genes is highly alternatively spliced in u. vulgaris and arabidopsis.

the gene encoding atp dependent rna helicase  was shown to be alternatively spliced not only in u. vulgaris, but also in u. gibba. it participates in the control of mrna splicing and export in arabidopsis  <cit>  and its expression is regulated by as in this plant. it is therefore possible that the paralogs encoding atp dependent rna helicase  play similar roles in utricularia.

we also documented extreme as in the isogroup  <dig> in u. vulgaris homologous to the gene for lcb-1-p lyase in arabidopsis. the function of lcb-1-p lyase or sphingosine-1-phosphate  lyase in plants is not fully understood. ng et al.  <cit> , coursol s et al.  <cit>  described the role of sph-1-p as a lipid messenger in guard cell abscisic acid  response. nishikawa et al.  <cit>  showed that lcb-1-p was degraded by lcb-1-p lyase , which was located in the endoplasmic reticulum. lcb-1-p lyase regulates lcb-1-p content and through this activity participates in stomata closure and dehydration stress response in arabidopsis  <cit> .

our u. vulgaris transcriptome was generated from submersed plant organs which did not develop stomata. however, we have verified that above-water flower stems of u. vulgaris contain stomata . it is therefore possible that transcripts with retained introns represent a pool from which functional transcripts may be readily formed by additional splicing when lcb-1-p lyase becomes necessary. this protein may be needed when the submersed plant body continues to grow above water. a similar regulatory role of intron retention was observed, for example, in the fern marsilea vestita, where transcripts with retained introns were stored in spores and spliced after germination  <cit> .

the expression of the gene for lcb-1-p lyase in submersed plant organs lacking stomata may also suggest that it fulfills a distinct function in utricularia, not associated with stomata. as sph-1-p affects ion channels in guard cell protoplasts  <cit> , we speculate that this lipid messenger may have a role in water pumping regulation in utricularia traps, which is associated with potassium channels in trap bifid glands  <cit> . finally, it is possible that extreme as in the isogroup  <dig> coding for lcb-1-p lyase does not have any regulatory function and represents an error in a complex splicing process. to our knowledge, as of transcripts encoding lcb-1-p lyase has not been studied in any plant species. we cannot determine whether this also occurs in u. gibba, because non-normalized transcriptomes have only limited potential to detect as.

duplication of the ein <dig> gene in u. vulgaris
we found a duplication of ein <dig> gene in u. vulgaris transcriptome. this gene is essential for ethylene signaling and occurs in a single copy in many plant species and its duplication is rare among angiosperms  <cit> . two ein <dig> paralogs undergoing accelerated evolution were recently identified in lotus japonicus  <cit> . they regulate not only a response to ethylene, but also nodulation in the course of symbiosis with rhizobia. the two ein <dig> paralogs in utricularia vulgaris may be important for the interaction between plants and microbes, similar to the role of the two ein <dig> genes in the symbiosis between leguminous plants and bacteria  <cit> . we speculate that the duplication of the ein <dig> gene occurred early in the evolution of the genus utricularia and might have been associated with the transition to a carnivorous life-style. subsequently, one copy was lost in u. gibba. similar ka/ks ratios in pairwise comparisons of utricularia ein <dig> genes do not indicate any shift in function. however, it should be emphasized, that only parts of the u. vulgaris ein <dig> genes, confirmed by sanger sequencing, were analyzed. the examination of additional species of lentibulariaceae regarding ein <dig> multiplication will shed light on the evolution and function of this important gene.

low sequence similarity between putative u. gibba-u. vulgaris orthologs
the median value of sequence similarity among  <dig>  putative orthologous pairs  between the two utricularia species was only 87% , much lower than for example a median ortholog similarity between two corylus species -  <cit>  or between chimpanzee and human  which belong to different genera. u. vulgaris and u. gibba are classified in the same generic section utricularia  <cit> , although they are not sister species. the reason for the high divergence between u. gibba and u. vulgaris appears to be a high substitution rate, described in lentibulariaceae as one of the characteristics of the plant carnivorous syndrome  <cit> . however, these two species still displayed very high sequence similarity in orthologs encoding ribosomal proteins, components of respiratory chain and cytoskeletal proteins, which were ultraconserved across the plant kingdom. we also observed a high conservation of some genes involved in root-associated function, which were generally less conserved among angiosperms. this could be explained by a functional shift shared by the two rootless aquatic utricularia species.

the loss of root-associated genes
we found a perfect coincidence between the absence of root-associated genes in the u. gibba genome  <cit>  and the absence of their counterparts in the u. vulgaris transcriptome. the correspondence between both utricularia species was also observed in additional root-associated genes, not specifically analyzed by  <cit>  . although the absence of particular genes in our transcriptome may be due to intrinsic incompleteness of any experimental transcriptomic data, the high coincidence between genomic and transcriptomic gene occurrences in two species suggests that many root-associated genes are indeed missing in the u. vulgaris genome. it is probable that the loss of root-associated genes had occurred already in the ancestor of u. gibba and u. vulgaris. the comparison of the presence or absence of root-associated genes in additional utricularia species will be very useful for understanding the adaptation to an aquatic rootless carnivorous life-style.

besides gene losses, gene duplications could be also very informative regarding the evolution and consequences of aquatic carnivory in plants. for example, the duplication of arf <dig> in u. gibba  <cit>  was also observed in the u. vulgaris transcriptome. in contrast, the ein <dig> duplication event was unique for u. vulgaris.

CONCLUSIONS
our study is the first example of comparative transcriptomics in the species-rich genus utricularia. we compared the transcriptome of u. vulgaris with the previously published transcriptome of u. gibba  <cit>  and confirmed a general similarity of their expression profiles. both utricularia species displayed some distinctions from the sarracenia transcriptome  <cit>  due to the aquatic life-style different from a terrestrial carnivory. average sequence similarity of the putative orthologs between u. vulgaris and u. gibba was lower than 90%, which could be caused by elevated substitution rate in this genus  <cit> . a strong correspondence in presence or absence of root-associated genes between u. vulgaris and u. gibba suggests that the loss of some root-specific genes had occurred before the two rootless species separated. future transcriptome and genome comparisons over numerous utricularia species will certainly deepen our understanding of plant evolution and adaptation.
