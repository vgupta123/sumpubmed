BACKGROUND
glanders occurs primarily in equines, but other species, including humans, may become incidental hosts  <cit> . the causal agent of glanders is the bacterium burkholderia mallei, a small, gram negative, non-motile, encapsulated, facultative intracellular rod  <cit> . the disease presents in three main forms: pulmonary, nasal and cutaneous  <cit> . in horses, glanders is usually chronic, and the infected animal may live for years. in donkeys and mules, the acute form is more common, and the infected animals may die in a few days. transmission of glanders occurs mainly by the ingestion of food and water contaminated by the secretions of animals with the clinical and sub-clinical forms of the disease and is exacerbated by crowded, unhealthy living conditions. sharing of grooming and riding equipment is also considered an important form of transmission.  <cit> .

glanders was eradicated from western europe and north america  <cit>  but is still present in asia, the middle east and south america  <cit> . in brazil, glanders was first described in  <dig> and was most likely introduced by the importation of infected horses from europe  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig>  the disease was not reported in the country. in  <dig>  though, it was diagnosed in the brazilian northeastern states of pernambuco and alagoas  <cit> , and subsequently, some foci were reported in other regions of the country  <cit> . the regulatory legislation for the control and eradication of glanders in brazil has adopted the cft and the mallein test for the identification of infected animals. the mallein test is used for confirmation of sub-clinical cases that were positive in the cft  <cit> . both tests have an excellent level of specificity   <cit> , but the level of sensitivity is suboptimal, with the sensitivity of the cft being approximately 97% and that of the mallein test being  <dig> %  <cit> . despite the high specificity, false positive results do occur in both tests, which may be related to inadequate purification of the antigen  <cit> . verma et al.  <cit>  partially purified the maleo-proteins on gel-filtration chromatographic columns, separating fractions of molecular weight above  <dig> kda and between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, and verified that the higher molecular weight fraction constituted a better antigen, showing higher sensitivity and specificity in the mallein test than the lower molecular weight fraction.

in this paper we describe a new method for the production and purification of the mallein antigens based on the separation of high and low molecular weight proteins by ultrafiltration in a tangential flow filtration system . the antigens were purified from mallein pre-concentrates produced from cultures of b. mallei strains isolated from clinical cases of glanders in brazil.

RESULTS
characterization of the b. mallei strains
two to three days after being inoculated, the guinea pigs developed a bilateral orchitis typical of b. mallei infection in this species . the animals were observed for another four to five days and then euthanized, and pure colonies of the bacterium were recovered from purulent material collected from their testicles. clinical signs and necropsy findings are listed in table  <dig>  the lack of death or severe illness during the seven-day observation period suggests that the strains are not highly virulent  <cit> .

the five strains of b. mallei showed the morphological and staining characteristics of a small, gram negative, non-spore-forming, irregularly stained rod with bipolar intracellular inclusions. after  <dig> hours, colonies in 4% glycerol-enriched nutrient agar were small, smooth, cream-colored, moist and viscous, and had the aspect of honey drops when examined against the light.

although there is considerable disagreement between different authors regarding the biochemical characterization of b. mallei, specifically in which sugars are utilized by this bacterium, the results shown here are enough to presumptively classify the samples as b. mallei <cit> .

characterization of the purified malleins
the resulting protein concentration of the five mallein pre-concentrates was approximately  <dig> mg/ml, but their chromatographic profiles showed considerable variation, revealing the existence of at least three peaks . all of the pre-concentrates, however, showed one peak with a shorter retention time of  <dig>  minutes. this peak was our target for purification because all of the other peaks demonstrated retention times indicative of protein fractions of molecular weights below  <dig> kda. that way, the purification process was repeated until the chromatographic profile showed a well-marked single peak for a solution with a protein concentration of approximately  <dig> mg/ml.

after the purification, the retained protein fractions  of four mallein pre-concentrates showed a single peak with a retention time of  <dig>  minutes , the same retention time of bovine thyroglobulin . the exception was purified mallein number  <dig>  which maintained a residual second peak formed at  <dig>  minutes . on the other hand, the largest peak of the removed protein fractions revealed a retention time between  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes , similar to the chromatographic profile of bovine albumin .

potency and specificity tests of the purified malleins
the evaluation of the efficiency of the sensitization of the animals utilized in the potency test by the cft revealed that they were able to mount an antibody response to the sensitizing emulsion .

*before first test.

the antibody titers rose quickly after the first dose of the sensitizing emulsion and remained stable after the second dose. subsequently, however, with the exception of animal number  <dig>  the titers dropped slightly, despite the reinforcement doses administered between the tests. animal number  <dig>  the oldest in the sensitized group, returned to the negative status after the second test but continued to show an allergic response to the malleins.

it should be noted, however, that after the first test, the response to the sensitizing emulsion might have suffered from the influence of the mallein inoculations themselves because it is well known that malleinization may cause seroconversion in healthy animals  <cit> .

analysis of variance of the potency and specificity tests revealed no significant difference among the means of the reactions at the four points of inoculation. only in the case of the potency test of the purified mallein number  <dig> was there a point x reagent interaction. in this case, there was a significant difference between points  <dig> and  <dig> only in the purified mallein. as this difference was not observed in any of the other tests, we chose not to consider it in the comparison of the means.

as is usually the case with biological responses, we expected a high coefficient of variation . indeed, the cv of the analysis of variance for the potency and specificity tests was high . for this reason, we used the t-test to compare the means because this test is the most accurate in the presence of high cvs, where the type ii error occurs frequently  <cit> . because the points of inoculation did not have a significant effect, we used the general mean effect in the comparisons.

the statistical analysis of the data from the potency tests showed that all of the purified malleins produced reactions significantly larger than those produced by the standard mallein .

the reactions produced by the purified malleins and by the standard mallein were significantly smaller in the negative controls than those produced in the sensitized animals . of the five purified malleins tested, only the number  <dig> showed a mean reaction greater than  <dig> mm in the non-sensitized group. for the standard, the reactions were even smaller, with the strongest reaction again occurring in the negative controls of the third test . the standard mallein elicited significantly smaller reactions than the purified malleins number  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the control group. for the purified malleins number  <dig> and  <dig>  however, this difference was not significant .

among the purified malleins, the number  <dig> showed the best specific activity, with a potency to specificity ratio of  <dig> , and the number  <dig> showed the worse specific activity, with a potency to specificity ratio of  <dig> . the mean potency to specificity ratio for the standard mallein in the five tests was  <dig>  .

field test
the results of the field test are included in table  <dig>  five out of the  <dig> animals tested were found positive for both the purified mallein number  <dig> and the standard, and nine were found negative also for the two reagents. only in one animal, where purified mallein number  <dig> was negative and the standard positive, the results did not match. the data, although obtained from a relatively small number of animals, give a kappa coefficient of  <dig> , which is considered an almost perfect agreement .

discussion
the molecular weight of the purified mallein coincided with that of bovine thyroglobulin , which agrees with the work of verma et al.  <cit>  for proteins in this fraction . the removed fraction, however, showed a molecular weight similar to that of bovine albumin , which differs from the results of the above cited study, whose authors found a molecular weight of 120– <dig> kda for this fraction. to separate the two fractions, however, those authors used a gel-filtration chromatographic column, collecting aliquots of the two main peaks identified in the chromatographic profile of the raw mallein, which allow us to obtain a better purified product, consisting of a more homogeneous group of proteins. our removed fraction, however, was not purified, but rather concentrated to elevate its protein concentration after the separation of the high molecular weight group of proteins. the resulting product consisted of various sub-fractions, which may have contributed to the increase in the retention time of its main peak following concentration.

the reactions obtained in the potency and specificity tests of this study were considerably smaller than those reported by verma et al.  <cit>  for the majority of the purified malleins they tested in similar experiments. for the standard mallein alone, the mean of the reactions obtained by the cited authors was 30 ±  <dig> mm in the sensitized animals and 6 ±  <dig> mm in the negative controls, and some of the purified malleins were equally potent or even more potent than the standard. for the production of the sensitizing emulsion, those authors used two strains of b. mallei considered to be highly virulent , which may have led to a higher sensitizing capacity. a positive correlation between virulence of the strain and potency of the mallein has already been suggested by verma et al.  <cit>  themselves. the strains of b. mallei we used to produce the sensitizing emulsion were only slightly virulent when tested in guinea pigs. if the correlation suggested by the above cited authors does exist, and if it’s in any way reasonable to extend it to the sensitizing capacity of the strain, so the difference in the magnitude of the reactions found in these two studies could be explained by the naturally low reactivity of the malleins produced by the local strains of b. mallei and by the low sensitizing capacity of these strains. furthermore, the efficiency of the sensitizing procedure might have been overestimated by monitoring the antibody responses of the sensitized animals, provided that the allergic reaction elicited by mallein is cell-mediated, as believed.

the standard mallein used in this experiment proved to be poorly reactive. the reactions it produced in the sensitized animals were rather small when compared to the reactions produced by the purified malleins. its lack of reactivity, however, might be related to antigenic variation between the b. mallei strains used in its production and the local ones used to produce the sensitizing emulsion. this possibility demonstrates the necessity of producing diagnostic reagents with antigenic affinity to the agents occurring in the region. however, the reactions produced by the standard mallein in the negative controls were very discrete, suggesting it has a high level of specificity.

two of the five purified malleins produced in this experiment, malleins number  <dig> and  <dig>  fared better than the other three in the potency and specificity tests. they proved to be reasonably potent and fairly specific, with potency to specificity ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. purified mallein number  <dig> was further tested in naturally infected animals and found to be equivalent to the standard, regarding its sensitivity and specificity. purified mallein number  <dig> was the most potent, but the reactions it produced in the negative controls suggest that it might be non-specific. this purified mallein was the least pure, as demonstrated by hplc, because we had to interrupt its purification to preserve its protein concentration. however, we cannot rule out the possibility of some cross-reactivity for the mallein antigen in the animals used as negative controls in the specificity test of this purified mallein, because it was in this group of animals that the standard mallein also produced its largest reactions. the other two purified malleins, number  <dig> and  <dig>  showed intermediate results in the potency and specificity tests and therefore make less ideal candidates for safe antigens in the diagnoses of glanders than the first two.

CONCLUSIONS
the local b. mallei strains have demonstrated considerable potential to produce mallein. the tff methodology was efficient in partially purifying the malleo-proteins, separating fractions of high and low molecular weight. the purified malleins were shown to have molecular weights similar to bovine thyroglobulin . the purified malleins produced from local strains of b. mallei are more potent and, in three out of five cases, demonstrate less specificity than the standard used in this experiment.

this study demonstrated the efficiency of the tff methodology in partially purifying soluble proteic antigens, provided additional information about a poorly characterized antigen and revealed the malleinogenic potential of some indigenous strains of b. mallei in brazil.
