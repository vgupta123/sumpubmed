BACKGROUND
pregnancy and parturition require an intricate interplay between maternal and fetal factors, orchestrated by the placenta, which lies at the interface between mother and fetus. the placenta performs multiple functions critical for fetal survival, growth, and development, including transport of gases, nutrients, and waste products, hormone production, protection of the fetus from maternal immune attack, and anchorage of the fetus to the uterus  <cit> . the role of the placenta as a key organ of pregnancy is well demonstrated by the fact that placental pathology is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as preterm birth , intrauterine growth restriction , and preeclampsia   <cit> .

the value of placental examination is well recognized in the setting of ptb, for instance, which complicates over 12% of all pregnancies in the u.s.  <cit> . histological examination of the placenta, which is frequently carried out to explore possible causes of preterm delivery, has been a useful tool for identifying lesions commonly associated with ptb, such as chorioamnionitis  <cit> . in cases where no remarkable histologic abnormalities are found, investigation into molecular alterations causing placental dysfunction could provide insight into the pathogenesis of prematurity.

the normal function of the placenta depends on its structural integrity, and the proper growth and development of its structural components require the finely tuned regulation of relevant genes. thus, alterations in gene expression and rna processing may represent one of the major molecular mechanisms underlying pathological pregnancies. previously, numerous studies have investigated changes in global human placental gene expression associated with gestational age  <cit> , physiologic labor  <cit>  or pathological conditions  <cit> . the two most comprehensive gene expression profiling studies related to the placenta used microarray analysis to characterize four different components of the human placenta in  <dig> individuals  <cit>  and the mouse placenta over the whole course of pregnancy  <cit> . although those microarray studies have provided useful insights into the placental transcriptome, they were limited in depth in that they only examined gene-level expression changes, and did not have the resolution to investigate the complexity of the placental transcriptome that arises from changes in rna processing.

alternative splicing  is a common mechanism of gene regulation in higher eukaryotes, occurring in over 90% of multi-exon genes in the human genome  <cit> . as is regulated by complex interactions between cis-acting splicing elements and trans-acting factors  <cit> . many splicing regulators have tissue-specific expression patterns, resulting in widespread differences in as patterns across different tissues. in addition to playing a critical role in regulating normal gene functions, as is also frequently involved in diseases  <cit> . previous studies have revealed associations between as of individual genes and human pregnancy complications  <cit> . for example, the soluble isoform of the fms-like tyrosine kinase- <dig>  arising from as and polyadenylation is significantly up-regulated in placentas of women with pe  <cit> , and encodes a potent inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> . despite such interesting anecdotal examples, the global patterns of as of human genes have not been examined systematically in the placenta.

in this study, we used high-throughput rna-seq to conduct a genome-wide analysis of the normal placental transcriptome. rna-seq is a powerful technology for transcriptome analysis that allows global characterization of gene expression and as at the nucleotide resolution  <cit> . given the heterogeneity in tissue composition of the placenta and the importance of both fetal and maternal factors in normal and pathological pregnancy, we separately examined three placental tissue components: the amnion and chorion of fetal origin, and the maternally derived decidua  <cit> . the amnion and chorion were obtained from the extraplacental membranes , which provide a purer source of the fetal membranes compared with those overlying the chorionic plate. the decidua was dissected from the surface of the basal plate of the placenta, which has close relevance to normal placental physiology. we observed a wide spectrum of gene-level and exon-level transcriptome differences both between placenta and other human tissues and between distinct compartments of the placenta. our work provides the first high-resolution profiles of gene expression and as characteristic of different parts of the normal human placenta.

RESULTS
overview of the rna-seq data
we sequenced pooled mrna of amnion, chorion, and decidua separately taken from five normal term placentas . for each of the placental tissues, we generated  <dig> lanes of paired-end illumina rna-seq data with  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in read length and 23- <dig> million reads of each lane, for a total of 50- <dig> million paired-end reads per tissue. we only used  <dig> bp of each end for mapping and analysis based on the sequencing error profile. in addition, we also obtained the illumina human body map  <dig>   data with 73- <dig> million  <dig> bp paired-end reads from  <dig> normal non-placental human tissues . we mapped the sequence reads of each tissue to the reference human genome sequence  as well as all possible exon-exon junctions . we obtained a high mapping rate with 70-90% and 7-10% of reads mapped to the reference genome and exon-exon junctions, respectively . 70-80% of the mapped paired-end reads were uniquely mapped pairs and were used for subsequent analysis.

global analysis of gene expression in placenta and other human tissues
using the uniquely mapped read pairs, we estimated the expression levels of  <dig>  protein-coding genes  in each tissue using the "fragments per kilobase of gene per million mapped fragments"  metric  <cit>  in a way similar to rpkm  <cit>  . with a coverage depth ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million paired-end reads per tissue, we detected the expression  of the majority of the protein-coding genes . approximately half of the genes were expressed with fpkm >  <dig> . we investigated the similarity in the global gene expression profiles among the three placental compartments and  <dig> hbm <dig>  tissues using average linkage hierarchical clustering of the top  <dig>  most divergent genes . the three placental tissues clustered more closely with one another than with the other  <dig> tissues, suggesting the existence of a placenta-specific gene expression signature. in addition, we also observed genes with distinct expression patterns among amnion, chorion, and decidua, indicating that each compartment of the placenta has its unique expression signature, possibly reflecting differences in their functions and/or biological activities.

to obtain a more detailed picture of genes potentially important for normal placental function, we compared the rna-seq gene expression profiles between the three placental compartments and the  <dig> hbm <dig>  tissues to identify two types of genes with preferential expression in the placenta:  placenta-enriched genes, defined as genes with an fpkm value of at least  <dig> and greater than 4-fold difference in fpkm between any of the three placental tissues and the average of the  <dig> non-placental tissues as similarly defined in another study  <cit> ; and  placenta-specific genes, defined as genes whose rna-seq reads were only detected in the placenta but not in any of the  <dig> non-placental tissues.

we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes with at least 4-fold enriched expression in amnion, chorion, and decidua, respectively, as compared to non-placental tissues, including  <dig> genes shared among the three compartments of the placenta. we also used a similar strategy to generate a list of  <dig> placenta-enriched genes using the geneatlas microarray data set covering whole placental and other human tissues  <cit>  . among the  <dig> array-based placenta-enriched genes,  <dig> were found to be enriched in one of the  <dig> placental tissues according to our rna-seq data, representing a significant overlap between the array and rna-seq results . the difference between the array and rna-seq based gene lists could be due to the difference in platforms as well as in tissue samples used for expression profiling. we also used a similar approach to identify tissue-enriched genes in each of the  <dig> hbm <dig>  tissues . of all  <dig> tissues, the three placental tissues were among the tissues with the highest number of tissue-enriched genes, with only testes, brain and white blood cells topping the placental tissues .

the rna-seq data also allowed us to identify genes whose expression was restricted to the placenta . we identified a total of  <dig> placenta-specific genes in the three placental compartments combined. we also used the same criteria to identify tissue-specific genes within the  <dig> hbm <dig>  tissues. consistent with the pattern observed for the tissue-enriched genes, the three placental tissues were among the tissues with the highest number of tissue-specific genes, only after testes and brain. taken together, these data indicate abundant tissue-specific activation of gene transcription in the placenta.

genes enriched in or specific to the placenta play important roles in placental function and pregnancy-related diseases
in order to understand the functional significance of the genes with enriched expression  in the placenta, we asked whether these genes have been implicated in placental biology and/or pregnancy disorders. we compiled two lists of human genes using the mouse genome informatics  database  <cit>  and the ptbgene database  <cit> . the mgi list consisted of human genes whose mouse orthologs are associated with abnormal placental phenotypes when disrupted. the ptb list consisted of genes collected from the literature on genetic association studies on preterm birth . we found that the placenta-enriched genes overlapped with  <dig> genes  in the mgi list and  <dig> genes  in the ptb list, significantly overrepresented compared to random expectation .

many of the genes associated with placental abnormalities in mice  were previously known to be involved in physiological and pathological processes related to pregnancy, with examples including prolactin receptor  and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> . the ptb list was particularly enriched with interleukin- <dig> -related genes, including il1r <dig>  il1rn, il1b, and il1a. we also found genes overlapping with both the mgi and ptb lists, such as coagulation factor ii  receptor  and vascular endothelial growth factor a .

to gain more insight into key processes that may possibly explain functional differences among the three placental tissues, we carried out functional annotation analysis of placenta-enriched genes identified in each of the three placental tissues compared with the other  <dig> human tissues using david  <cit> . the analysis revealed significant enrichment  of gene ontology  terms and kegg pathways involved in a wide range of biological processes, including focal adhesion, vasculature development, wound healing, and extracellular matrix -receptor interaction . of particular note is that there was no significantly enriched go term shared among all three placental tissues, indicating that each compartment of the placenta has its unique profile of active genes involved in different biological processes.

analysis was performed on genes identified as being enriched in each of the three placental tissues compared to the other  <dig> human tissues

# go term biological process categories are based on go fat definition from the david website; kegg and panther are the corresponding pathways defined in the david website.

although there was no go annotation shared by all three compartments, we identified several biologically relevant enriched categories that overlap between the two membranous compartments amnion and chorion. for example, epithelium development, one of those categories, explains a common compositional feature that exists between the two tissues with both at least partially consisting of a layer of cells that are epithelial in origin   <cit> . the enrichment of cell/biological adhesion-related genes supports the role of the two membranes as a barrier protecting the fetus from external mechanical force, which requires substantial involvement of cell adhesion molecules. of note is that we also observed an overrepresentation of mesoderm development in both tissues when we performed our analysis using a different annotation system panther  <cit> , which reflects a common structural feature shared by the two membranes.

among the non-overlapping go terms, it was noted that there was significant overrepresentation of vascular-related go terms such as blood vessel development, vasculature development, blood vessel morphogenesis, and angiogenesis in the chorion, while these terms were absent from the amnion, an avascular tissue. one of the genes belonging to these categories is vegfa, which is an extensively studied gene that acts as a signal triggering the induction of angiogenesis  <cit>  and has been implicated in pregnancy complications  <cit> .

we found that three go terms are significantly enriched for the decidua with female pregnancy being the most enriched category, consistent with the role of decidua as a principal source of hormones and cytokines pivotal in the maintenance of pregnancy. it was noted that many of the genes associated with female pregnancy have also been implicated in pregnancy-related disorders. these genes include transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  and placental growth factor  in pe  <cit>  and corticotropin releasing hormone  in preterm labor or delivery  <cit> .

for placenta-specific genes, we further removed genes with extremely low fpkm values  in the placental tissues, which could represent genes with universal low expression in all tissues but sampled by rna-seq in the placenta by chance. this led to a final set of  <dig> placenta-specific well-annotated protein-coding genes with fpkm >  <dig>  in at least one placental tissue. the placenta-specific genes are highly enriched for genes encoding pregnancy-related hormones, including pregnancy-specific glycoproteins , chorionic somatomammotropin hormones , and chorionic gonadotropin, beta polypeptides  .

expression profiles of splicing factors  in placental and other human tissues
the deep rna-seq data also allowed us to go beyond whole transcript level changes, to identify transcript isoform changes due to pre-mrna alternative splicing . splicing factors  are rna binding proteins that play key roles in as regulation  <cit> . tissue- and cell-type specific expression of sfs is a major mechanism that drives as differences among human tissues  <cit> . for example, brain-specific sfs nova <dig>  nova <dig>  and fox <dig> control a large number of brain-specific as events  <cit> . the epithelial-specific splicing factor esrp <dig> is transcriptionally silenced during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which flips the switch off for a genome-wide epithelial splicing regulatory network  <cit> .

to identify sfs with a placenta-specific increase or decrease in expression levels, we compiled a list of sixty well-studied sfs  <cit> , and analyzed their rna-seq fpkm gene expression levels in the placenta and  <dig> other human tissues. hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> sfs revealed a sub-cluster among the three placental compartments, , consistent with the clustering pattern based on all genes . this cluster analysis recapitulated the known tissue-specific expression patterns of sfs, such as the brain-specific expression of nova <dig>  nova <dig>  fox <dig> , and brunol <dig>  interestingly, we identified several sfs with compartment-specific changes in expression levels in the placenta, most notably esrp <dig>  and mbnl <dig>  , which we confirmed by qrt-pcr . esrp <dig> and mbnl <dig> are known to regulate splicing of a large number of genes in epithelial cells  <cit>  and during myogenic differentiation  <cit> , suggesting a unique set of as events in individual placental compartments downstream of these master splicing regulators. we also identified several ubiquitously expressed sfs with a significant difference in expression levels among the three placental compartments. for example, fox <dig> , an important splicing regulator in the heart, muscle, and neurons  <cit> , was expressed two-fold higher in amnion compared to chorion and decidua. together, the expression profiles of sfs suggest tissue-specific regulation of as between the placenta and other tissues and between different compartments of the placenta.

rna-seq and rt-pcr analysis of exon skipping events in placental and other human tissues
to directly identify as differences between the placenta and other human tissues, we calculated the exon inclusion level  of alternatively spliced cassette exons in each tissue using rna-seq reads that are uniquely mapped to the upstream, downstream, and skipping exon-exon junctions of alternatively spliced exons as previously described  <cit> . we used a bayesian approach mats   <cit>  to perform pairwise comparisons of tissue pairs to test if the difference in Ψ of any alternatively spliced exon between two tissues exceeds 10% . between the three compartments of the placenta, approximately  <dig> % of exons were found to be differentially spliced . in contrast, there was a much greater degree of splicing difference between placental and other human tissues, with  <dig> % of exons, on average, being differentially spliced between one of the placental tissues and one of the  <dig> hbm <dig>  tissues . it should be noted that given the moderate sequencing depth of 50- <dig> million reads per tissue, this analysis is expected to have an appreciable level of false negatives. the true extent of splicing differences among these tissues could be considerably larger.

in order to boost the power of rna-seq splicing analysis and obtain a robust set of splicing differences between the placental and non-placental tissues, we pooled the rna-seq data of all hbm <dig>  tissues. we then compared the pooled data to that of each placental tissue. we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> differentially spliced exons  when comparing the pooled non-placental tissues to amnion, chorion, and decidua, respectively .  <dig> exons  were shared among the three placental tissues. on the other hand, the majority  of differentially spliced exons identified were restricted to only one of the three placental tissues as compared to the non-placental tissues . importantly, among the  <dig> genes containing differentially spliced exons between placental and non-placental tissues, we observed a significant enrichment for genes in the mgi list , indicating the importance of tissue-specific as in placental function and development. for example, one of these exons  was in integrin, alpha  <dig> , which forms heterodimers with other integrin components and plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and migration  <cit> . we observed a high inclusion level of this exon in amnion and chorion compared to most of the other tissues, with close to 100% exon inclusion in amnion as validated by fluorescently labeled rt-pcr . exon  in another integrin gene itgb <dig> was frequently skipped in the placental tissues . tcirg <dig>  is another differentially spliced gene with multiple known isoforms produced by as  <cit> . as shown in figure 5c, the inclusion level of one of its exons  was significantly lower in amnion.

to further confirm the rna-seq results of exon splicing, we randomly selected  <dig> exons in total  for fluorescently labeled rt-pcr. using an independent set of term placental samples  that were not used in the rna-seq experiments, we validated the predicted differential splicing events of  <dig> exons, yielding a validation rate of 79%. the rna-seq difference in exon inclusion levels between the placental tissues and the pooled non-placental tissues strongly matched the rt-pcr results  .

the splicing factor esrp <dig> regulates tissue-specific splicing in amnion
the placenta-specific increase in the expres levels of certain master splicing regulators such as esrp <dig> and mbnl <dig> raises the possibility that downstream exon targets of these regulators may have altered splicing activities in the placenta over non-placental tissues. to test this, we studied the splicing factor esrp <dig>  which had  <dig>  fold higher expression in amnion over the average of the  <dig> hbm <dig>  tissues . of note, among the exons validated by rt-pcr as differentially spliced between amnion and non-placental tissues, several were known esrp <dig> targets . to assess the overall enrichment of esrp <dig> target exons among differentially spliced exons in amnion, we collected  <dig> rt-pcr validated esrp <dig> target exons from our previous genome-wide analysis of esrp1-regulated splicing events in epithelial and mesenchymal cells  <cit> . of the  <dig> known esrp <dig> target exons,  <dig> were expressed and detectable in our data. among them, a significantly enriched set of  <dig> exons exhibited differential splicing in amnion compared to other human tissues according to rna-seq data  .

given our moderate sequencing depth in the placental tissues, it is possible that additional esrp <dig> target exons with differential splicing in amnion were missed by rna-seq. we therefore selected additional  <dig> esrp <dig> target exons besides the aforementioned  <dig> validated exons for rt-pcr analysis, resulting in  <dig> exons tested in total. seven of those exons did not have any rna-seq reads presumably due to their relatively low expression levels and the limited coverage depth of our sequencing data. we confirmed that  <dig> of the  <dig> esrp <dig> target exons showed more than 10% changes in splicing in amnion, with known esrp1-enhanced exons having increased splicing activities, and known esrp1-silenced exons having decreased splicing activities. one of the validated esrp <dig> target exons was in misshapen-like kinase  <dig> , which has an important role in cell adhesion and motility  <cit> . the exon  in mink <dig>  a known esrp <dig> target had an inclusion level of > 90% in amnion, approximately 20-30% higher than those observed for other human tissues . the increased splicing activity of this mink <dig> exon was consistent with the previous observation that esrp <dig> positively regulates the splicing of this exon  <cit> .

analysis of pathways influenced by tissue-enriched expression and differential splicing in placenta
the differential gene- and exon-level expression patterns observed between the placental and non-placental tissues may underlie gene pathways that have key roles in the normal biology of the placenta. to identify pathways and molecular networks influenced by placenta-specific gene expression and splicing, we constructed functional interaction  networks  <cit>  covering genes with enriched expression  and genes with differential splicing  in amnion, chorion and decidua compared to other human tissues. these genes were used as query sets and projected onto a functional interaction network of human genes constructed from diverse genomic data sources  <cit> . we used the edge betweenness algorithm  <cit>  to find functional modules in the network, each of which contained enriched functional annotation terms  that describe the biological roles of genes that are grouped together.

the results of our analysis performed on each of the three placental tissues showed significant enrichment of many functional pathways , including those involved in the regulation of smad2/ <dig> signaling, tgf-beta receptor signaling, and hif- <dig> alpha tf network, which were significantly overrepresented in module  <dig> of all the amnion, chorion, and decidua fi networks .

the analysis performed on genes abundantly expressed and/or differentially spliced in all three placental tissues revealed strong overrepresentation of pathways related to integrin signaling and focal adhesion . these pathways were enriched with genes encoding collagens , laminins , filamins , integrin , and actinin , all of which are structural components of extracellular matrix . these results suggest the critical role of ecm in processes involved in normal placental biology. it is interesting to note that the network module contained an appreciable number of both differentially expressed and differentially spliced genes, suggesting that as and gene transcription act in a coordinated manner to control the overall pathway activity in the placenta.

novel transcriptional active regions 
one major advantage of rna-seq compared to microarray technology is its capability to detect un-annotated novel transcripts. to identify novel transcriptional active regions  in placental tissues, we used the software scripture  <cit>  for ab initio reconstruction of transcripts for each tissue after sequence mapping with tophat  <cit>  . we identified approximately  <dig>  transcripts in each of the placental tissues with more than 70% of them being multi-exon transcripts . to reduce false signals, only multiexon transcripts were used in the following analysis. after overlapping transcripts were merged into one single tar, a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  tars were found in amnion, chorion, and decidua, respectively. we filtered out the ones overlapping with the annotated transcripts from the ncbi refseq, ucsc, ensembl, and vega database and identified  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> novel tars in amnion, chorion, and decidua, respectively. the expression levels of the identified novel tars are listed in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  importantly, a large proportion of these novel tars  are placenta-specific or more than  <dig> fold enriched compared to non-placental tissues. shown in figure  <dig> is one example of novel tars on chromosome  <dig>  expressed in amnion with a high fpkm value of  <dig> . of note, this transcript is not documented in any human gene databases, although the existence of human expressed sequence tags  at this locus further supports the validity of this tar .

analysis was performed using software scripture for ab initio reconstruction of transcripts for each placental tissue after sequence mapping with tophat.

*tar: transcriptional active region after merging overlapping transcripts

# single exon transcripts were not included in all the downstream analysis

we also used rna-seq data to identify novel exons in annotated genes. there are a total of between  <dig> and  <dig> thousand exons identified in the tars overlapping with annotated genes. although more than 80% of these exons were well annotated with the same 5' and 3' ends, we detected between  <dig> and  <dig> totally new exons with no sequence overlap with any annotated exons in the placental tissues. these novel tars and exons provide a valuable resource for novel transcripts with potential functional significance in the placenta.

discussion
with the emergence of new high-throughput technologies such as rna sequencing, we have recently witnessed a remarkable increase in our knowledge of mammalian transcriptome content and diversity. there has been a particular surge in our understanding of the transcriptome diversity between different tissues and cell types. for example, wang et al. performed an rna-seq analysis of  <dig> human tissues and cell lines and identified over  <dig>  tissue-specific as events  <cit> . other studies have established the association between tissue-specific expression of sfs and genome-wide changes in tissue-specific splicing patterns  <cit> , which underscores a critical role of as regulation in tissue differentiation and specialization.

the majority of previous gene expression studies of human placental tissue have only provided gene-level insights  <cit> , driving the need for higher-resolution analysis to enable a better understanding of the complexity of the placental transcriptome at the level of exon splicing. as, which has a well-established role in cell differentiation  <cit> , may be critical for the proper functioning of the placenta, an organ composed of a variety of differentiated cell types, each with its own specific functions during pregnancy. thus, uncovering the complexity of as in the placental transcriptome will provide a valuable basis for understanding genes with functional and clinical relevance in placental biology and pathophysiology.

in the present study, we used rna-seq to characterize the transcriptome of selected compartments of the human placenta from normal term pregnancies. rna-seq allows an unbiased and sensitive interrogation of the full repertoire of placental mrna transcripts. we took a two-step approach to analyze the rna-seq data at both the gene-level and the exon-level. first, we investigated differential gene expression between the placental and other human tissues to identify genes that are specifically or abundantly expressed in the placenta. second, we carried out exon profiling as well as sf expression profiling to find as events and their potential regulators that are differentially present in the placental versus non-placental tissues.

we have compared placenta-enriched genes to genes with putative functional significance in the placenta using the mouse phenotype data and human ptb association study data. we observed that genes implicated in placental abnormalities and ptb are enriched among the genes with placenta-enriched expression profiles. we note that the mouse phenotype data from mgi were generated independent of any previously known gene expression pattern in the placenta. among such genes are prlr and f2r, genes encoding receptors for prolactin and thrombin, respectively, whose levels are precisely regulated during pregnancy  <cit> . the enrichment of il1-related genes was also noted, suggesting the importance of il <dig> signaling in normal placental function and pregnancy. igf <dig>  one of the genes associated with abnormal placental phenotypes in mice, is known for its active role in placental and fetal growth  <cit> . together, these provide a link between highly expressed placenta-enriched genes and their functional importance in the placenta. similarly, our work provides evidence suggesting the importance of genes uniquely expressed in the placenta in diverse pregnancy-related processes, with examples including csh <dig> in the regulation of fetal growth  <cit> , cgb in the maintenance of early pregnancy  <cit> , and human leukocyte antigen-g  in feto-maternal immune tolerance  <cit> . in addition, we observed a significant enrichment of differentially spliced genes in the placenta among genes with placental phenotypes in the mouse, suggesting the importance of tissue-specific as in placental development and function.

because the hbm <dig>  data all came from adult tissues, it is possible that some placenta-enriched genes identified in our study reflect age-specific expression signatures. because of the unavailability of rna-seq data from other fetal tissues, we assessed this possibility using the geneatlas array data  <cit> . there were  <dig> fetal tissues  included in the geneatlas data. of the  <dig> genes with at least 4-fold enrichment in the placenta over adult tissues in both the geneatlas array data and our rna-seq data, the vast majority  were more than 4-fold enriched in the placenta compared with the  <dig> fetal tissues according to the geneatlas array data. this suggests that the placenta-enriched genes identified in our study reflect genuine placenta-associated gene expression signatures. in addition, the strong association of placental expression enrichment with placental disease-related gene sets further supports that most of the placenta-enriched genes found here reflect tissue effect rather than age effect.

given the heterogeneous tissue composition of the placenta, we have characterized the transcriptome profiles of the placenta not only at the whole-organ level, but also at the sub-organ level. it should be noted that the placental samples used in our study  may not be completely pure, containing minor contamination with other placental components. nonetheless, our study demonstrated that they are highly enriched for the corresponding tissue types, displaying compartment-specific expression profiles and splicing patterns. the amnion is the innermost layer of the fetal membranes lining the amniotic cavity and is composed of an epithelial cell layer on top of a basement membrane and an avascular matrix  <cit> . consistent with these histological properties of the amnion, we have detected enrichment of genes involved in cell/focal adhesion and observed that the epithelial splicing regulator esrp <dig> was highly expressed. our splicing analysis of the amnion using rna-seq and rt-pcr revealed  <dig> and  <dig> known esrp <dig> target exons, respectively, with differential splicing activities in the amnion. it should be noted that esrp <dig> is a master cell-type-specific splicing regulator critical for maintaining the epithelial cell identity and has been implicated in a variety of developmental and disease processes  <cit> . the esrp <dig> target exons are strongly enriched in genes involved in the regulation of cell adhesion such as the exon in mink <dig>  <cit> , that was found to be differentially spliced in the amnion compared to other human tissues by rna-seq and validated by rt-pcr. these data support a role of the esrp <dig> splicing regulatory network in the amnion. the chorion, the outer layer of the fetal membranes in contact with the decidua, consists of the reticular layer, the basement membrane, and the trophoblast layer  <cit> . similar to the amnion, genes with a role in cell/biological adhesion are also enriched in the chorion, which may be important for the adherence of the trophoblast layer to the decidua  <cit> . the enrichment of genes involved in vascular-related processes in the chorion may be explained by velamentous vessels traversing the extraplacental membranes or maternal vessels in interdigitating decidua processed along with the chorion. unlike the two fetal membranes, the decidua is of maternal origin  <cit> . it is noteworthy that genes related to female pregnancy were significantly enriched in this compartment of the placenta, further supporting the crucial role of this tissue in pregnancy. of note, we observed significant differential expression of a splicing factor mbnl <dig> in the decidua. in future studies, it would be useful to examine how mbnl <dig> globally impacts gene splicing and function in the decidua.

we also examined potential interactions among genes highly expressed and differentially spliced in the placenta compared to other human tissues by constructing fi networks composed of sub-network modules enriched for specific gene categories and functional pathways. analysis performed separately on each of the three placental tissues revealed enrichment of set of pathways commonly enriched in all three compartments, for example, regulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear smad2/ <dig> signaling and tgf-beta receptor signaling. these pathways are known to be involved in a wide range of cellular processes  <cit> , which reflects the versatile function of the placenta that can be achieved through diverse cellular activities occurring in different parts of the placenta. among its other main functions, the placenta plays an important role as an immune barrier, protecting the fetus from the mother's immune system  <cit> . this function is reflected by the enriched expression of transcription factors  involved in immune regulation such as gata <dig> and irf <dig> as well as the differential splicing of rel, a member of the rel/nfkb family and nfatc <dig>  a member of the nuclear factors of activated t cells transcription complex. hif- <dig> alpha tf network is another pathway that was enriched in module  <dig> of all the three fi networks. the placenta, during its development, is exposed to different oxygen environments and tight regulation of oxygen homeostasis is necessary for proper placental development and function, which requires active involvement of the hif- <dig> alpha tf network  <cit> . these findings suggest:  the common importance of these pathways in the functioning of the different parts of the placenta examined in the present study; and  the importance of the regulation of gene expression and as as critical mechanisms underlying anatomical, developmental, and functional specialization of the placenta. when the analysis was performed on all of the tissues combined, we observed the overrepresentation of ecm-related gene sets such as integrin signaling pathway, ecm-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and integrin cell surface interactions. these results provide evidence for the role of ecm in placental development and placental cell proliferation as demonstrated in earlier studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides the first comprehensive view of the placental transcriptome at exon-level resolution, and reveals that tissue-specific gene regulation in the placenta involves complex changes in both gene transcription and exon splicing. our data should serve as a valuable resource for future in-depth investigations into what genes contribute to specification of the placenta. all of the rna-seq data can be accessed as the raw rna-seq reads and as a processed ucsc genome browser custom track http://intron.healthcare.uiowa.edu/placenta/. furthermore, the findings of this work may provide useful clues on how those genes/pathways, when altered at either the gene level or exon level, could lead to pregnancy-related diseases. future research using tissues from abnormal conditions will help expand our knowledge of the transcriptome alterations and pathological processes involved in maternal and fetal complications.
