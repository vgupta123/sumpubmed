BACKGROUND
motor neurons  are selectively depleted, or diminished, in motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . various factors contribute to the pathogenesis of als including mutations in the sod <dig> gene, mutations in the als <dig> 
 <cit> , fus 
 <cit> , tardbp 
 <cit> , atxn <dig> 
 <cit>  and ang 
 <cit>  genes, and the recently-discovered intronic hexanucleotide expansions in c9orf <dig> <cit> . in mutant sod <dig> disease models, non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mn degeneration
 <cit> . the mechanism by which astrocytes facilitate mn loss has not yet been fully identified, but a number of potential mechanisms have been reported. the production of ngf  ) in reactive sod1-g93a  astrocytes can induce death of rat mns expressing p75-receptor, through a mechanism that involves nitric oxide and peroxynitrite formation
 <cit> . the increased secretion of pro-ngf and subsequent induction of toxic p <dig> receptor signalling within neighbouring motor neurons is believed to be a key element of the toxicity of mutant sod1-expressing astrocytes to motor neurons
 <cit> . studies in mouse have similarly shown that astrocytes expressing mutant forms of sod1-g37r , sod1-g85r , and sod1-g93a , release soluble factors that can selectively kill embryonic stem  cell-derived or primary mns in vitro, and have demonstrated that neurotoxicity by sod1-g93a astrocytes is mediated through the recruitment of the bax-dependent death machinery. by contrast, conditioned medium from wild-type sod1-expressing astrocytes displays a supportive/survival effect on mns similar to that observed with non-transgenic astrocytes
 <cit> . co-culture of es cell-derived mns with sod1-g93a astrocytes markedly decreases mn survival relative to primary wild-type sod <dig> astrocytes
 <cit> . in vivo, the transplantation of glial-restricted precursor cells into the vicinity of cervical spinal cord respiratory mns in a sod1-g93a rat model of motor neuron disease limits progression of the disease, resulting in enhanced motor and respiratory physiological functions and enhanced survival
 <cit> . the neuroprotective effects have been partly attributed to increased expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, glt <dig>  taken together, the evidence from these studies suggests that astrocytes are critically involved in mn depletion in als, most likely acting through multiple mechanisms.

as yet, no study has examined whether astrocytes exert an effect on mn-progenitor cells. two factors suggest this is an important question. first, the efficient derivation of mature  mns from embryonic stem cells is a sought-after goal in the understanding, and potential treatment, of motor neuron diseases: factors that enhance early steps in mn differentiation will therefore contribute to the derivation of mns ex vivo. second, the realisation that new neurons can be generated within the adult brain suggests the possibility that als-driven mn depletion may result from the loss of adult-born neurons. recent experiments in songbirds show that adult neurogenesis can result in the addition of new neurons to cortical premotor circuits that govern peripheral muscle control
 <cit> , while dopamine produced by projections of the brain promotes adult mn regeneration in lesioned spinal cord in zebrafish
 <cit> , supporting this idea. thus, we aimed to extend current knowledge by examining the potential effect of astrocytes on mn progenitors. here we show that wild-type astrocyte-conditioned medium promotes the efficient generation of mn progenitors from mouse es cells. by contrast, sod1-g93a astrocytes are less supportive for the generation of these mn progenitors.

RESULTS
spatio-temporal expression profiles of transcription factors in mn development in mouse neural tube
as a basis for monitoring mn differentiation from mouse es cells in vitro, we first examined the expression profiles of the transcription factors olig <dig>  hb9/mnr <dig> and islet <dig> in the embryonic mouse neural tube at e <dig> ; all have been previously demonstrated to be involved in mn fate determination
 <cit> .

as previously shown
 <cit> , olig <dig> expression is restricted to the ventral neural tube, demarcating progenitor domain v <dig> and mn . by contrast, hb9/mnr <dig> expression is restricted to differentiated mns in the mantle zone of the emerging spinal cord . consistent with this, double labelling of hb9/mnr <dig> with ki <dig>  a marker of proliferating cells, reveals no overlap, confirming that hb9/mnr <dig> is a marker for post-mitotic mns . double-labelling for olig <dig> and hb9/mnr <dig> reveals that the majority of olig2+ cells do not co-express hb9/mnr <dig> and are largely restricted to the ventricular zone and subventricular zone , the region of the developing neural tube that harbours proliferating progenitor cells. a small proportion of olig2+ cells  were hb9/mnr2+. these olig2+/hb9+ cells were found furthest from the vz/svz, and represent a population of olig2+ cells that are making their transition towards hb9/mnr2+ differentiating mns as they migrate away from the medial vz to the peripheral mantle zone . similarly, a few olig2+/islet1+ cells were located away from the vz/svz and were detected immediately adjacent to olig2-/islet1+ differentiated mns . taken together, our data confirm previous reports
 <cit> , showing that many olig2+ cells are proliferating mn progenitor cells. these analyses suggest, further, that the combinatorial analysis of olig <dig>  hb9/mnr <dig> and islet <dig> expression can be used as a basis for monitoring the differentiation status of mns from mouse es cells.

wild-type but not mutant sod1-g93a astrocyte-conditioned medium promotes the generation of mn progenitors from mouse es cells and subsequent mn differentiation
the effect of conditioned medium  from cultured wild-type non-transgenic  astrocytes on differentiated mns was first assessed, in comparison to control medium . mn differentiation was assessed through hb9:egfp reporter activity and further confirmed by co-expression of either β3-tubulin or islet <dig>  hb9:egfp+ mns co-expressed β3-tubulin  and islet <dig> . quantitative analyses showed that culture with wt non-tg astrocyte cm resulted in a marked increase in mns. the percentage of egfp+ mns was increased by a fold-change of  <dig> , compared to the control  , consistent with previous findings that wt non-tg astrocyte cm results in a highly significant increase in differentiated mns
 <cit> .

to determine whether the increased proportion of differentiated mns might be due, in part, to enhanced numbers of progenitors, we analysed expression of the b-hlh  transcription factor, olig2
 <cit> . many olig2+ cells were detected within the cultures . high magnification views after combinatorial labelling with olig <dig>  hb9:egfp and β3-tubulin, or olig <dig>  hb9:egfp and islet <dig> revealed that the vast majority of olig2+ cells did not co-express either β3-tubulin  or islet  <dig> . quantitative analyses revealed that only a very minor proportion of olig2+ cells co-expressed β3-tubulin  or islet <dig>  . a significantly higher percentage of olig2+ mn-progenitor cells was detected in cultures grown in wt non-tg astrocyte cm, compared to those in control medium . quantitative analyses showed that the percentage of olig2+ mn-progenitors in wt non-tg astrocyte cm was increased by  <dig> -fold compared to the control . these data suggest that a primary effect of wt non-tg astrocyte cm is to increase the number of mn progenitor cells. importantly, moreover, culture with wt non-tg astrocyte cm appeared to result in a more robust conversion of olig2+ progenitors to mns or survival of mns. in the case of controls, approximately  <dig> % of olig2+ progenitors differentiated to mns, whereas with wt non-tg astrocyte cm, approximately  <dig> % of olig2+ progenitors differentiated to mns. thus, wt non-tg astrocyte cm may promote the generation of differentiated mns in two ways: first, by increasing the numbers of progenitors, and second, by supporting their robust differentiation/survival.

in contrast to the effects of wt non-tg astrocyte cm, medium conditioned by astrocytes derived from transgenic mice expressing mutant sod1-g93a  did not show a supportive effect on olig2+ mn progenitors. quantitative analyses showed that in tg sod1-g93a cm, the number of olig2+ mn-progenitors was similar to those in the control , but decreased significantly  compared to the littermate wt non-tg cm . tg sod1-g93a astrocyte cm similarly appeared far less able to support egfp+ mns, compared to wt non-tg astrocyte cm. quantitative analyses revealed a two-fold difference in the percentage of egfp+ mns in tg sod1-g93a cm compared to the littermate wt non-tg cm  . notably, however, the efficiency of differentiation to mns from olig2+ progenitors in tg sod1-g93a cm appears comparable to that in wt non-tg astrocyte cm . to determine whether tg sod1-g93a cm decreases the numbers of mn progenitors and mns by increasing apoptosis, indicative of the presence of a toxic factor
 <cit> , we analysed chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation after dapi-labelling
 <cit> . quantitative analyses revealed no statistically significant association of the number of apoptotic cells with any of the three media . taken together, these results indicate that, while cm from wt non-tg astrocytes is strongly supportive of both olig2+ mn progenitor cells and egfp+ mns, cm from tg sod1-g93a astrocytes appears to lack, in particular, a trophic support factor to motor neuron progenitors.

in order to confirm that the significant differences found in the proportion of olig2+ mn-progenitor cells and egfp+ mns between the wt non-tg astrocyte cm and the sod1-g93a or the control medium were indeed due to the presence of the g93a mutation and not to the presence of the transgene, a similar study was performed, this time using conditioned medium from transgenic astrocytes over-expressing human wild-type sod <dig> , or, for comparison, cm from their wt non-tg littermates. as expected, the percentage of egfp+ mns detected after culture with either wt non-tg or wtsod <dig> cm was similar , while both media evoked a higher proportion of differentiated mns than control medium . similarly, there was a significant difference in the percentage of olig2+ mn-progenitor cells in cultures grown in wt non-tg astrocyte cm compared to control medium . however, there was almost no difference in the proportion of olig2+ cells supported through wt non-tg murine astrocyte cm, compared to cm from tg wtsod <dig> littermates . the similar proportion of olig2+ progenitors and egfp+ mns generated in the presence of wt non-tg and tg wtsod <dig> astrocyte cm  suggests that the presence and over-expression of the human transgene in mouse astrocytes is not the reason for any observed differences in the numbers of egfp+ mns. therefore, the difference in the proportion of egfp+ mns in the wt non-tg and tg sod1-g93a astrocyte cm is likely to be due to the effect of the sod1-g93a mutation.

neither wild type astrocyte cm nor mutant sod1g93a astrocyte cm affects the generation of lhx1/5+ interneurons from mouse es cells
we next examined whether the observed effects of tg sod1-g93a and wt non-tg astrocyte cm were specific to mn-progenitors and mns or whether similar effects might be observed with other types of neurons. analysis of lhx1/5+/hb9- interneurons 
 <cit>  revealed that the proportion of interneurons that differentiated in cultures was very similar for all three types of media examined. thus, tg sod1-g93a cm, littermate wt non-tg astrocyte cm and control medium appeared to be equally supportive to interneurons . this comparative study suggests that the supportive factors in wt non-tg and tg wtsod <dig> astrocyte cm that are lacking in sod1-g93a astrocyte cm may act only on mn progenitor cells and therefore particularly affect differentiated mns.

discussion
published studies over the last few years have demonstrated negative effects of mutant sod <dig> astrocytes on mn survival
 <cit>  but no study has so far examined any potential effects on mn progenitor cells. the question of how astrocyte cm may impact on mn progenitors is important, both from the perspective of ex vivo differentiation strategies and, from the perspective of adult neurogenesis, since buffering of the niche from localised astrocytes may affect survival and differentiation efficiency of the progenitors. here we demonstrate an impact of astrocyte cm on both mn progenitors and mns, and demonstrate that mutant sod <dig> astrocytes fail, particularly, to provide survival/trophic support to mn progenitors.

our study reveals markedly higher numbers of olig2+ mn progenitor cells and egfp+ mns in wt non-tg astrocyte cm and consistently lower numbers in littermate tg sod1-g93a cm. in contrast, tg wtsod <dig> and littermate wt non-tg cm have similar effects on egfp+ mns and olig2+ mn-progenitors, indicating that our findings are likely due to the presence of mutant sod1-g93a, rather than over-expressed sod <dig> per se.

the significantly higher number of olig2+ mn progenitor cells in the wt non-tg astrocyte cm supports the idea that normal astrocytes favour mn development potentially by secreting supportive and/or trophic factors that promote mn progenitors. the positive role of astrocytes in promoting mn growth and maturation in in vitro cultures is already established
 <cit> . wild-type and mutant sod <dig> astrocytes produce substantial amounts of functionally-variable factors that can positively or negatively affect mn survival. such factors include trophic factors 
 <cit> , pro-inflammatory/inflammatory proteins 
 <cit> , proteases  and protease inhibitors, carrier proteins , extracellular matrix binding proteins  and anti-oxidant proteins 
 <cit> . our study extends current knowledge by showing that astrocytes also positively affect mn progenitor cells, potentially governing olig2+ cell-proliferation or olig2+ cell-survival.

unlike wt non-tg astrocyte cm, tg sod1-g93a astrocyte cm does not favour mn progenitor cell growth: similar numbers of olig2+ cells are found in tg sod1-g93a cm and in control non-conditioned medium. the relatively high numbers of differentiated mns found with sod1-g93a cm, compared to control non-conditioned medium, however, suggests that the mutant astrocyte cm does support mn differentiation/survival. it is therefore likely that a number of the aforementioned factors that are produced by astrocytes and that affect mn survival are secreted in the conditioned medium and are also able to affect mn progenitor cell survival, growth or differentiation.

our findings support a previous study that shows a halving in the number of primary and es cell-derived mns when cultured in tg sod1-g93a astrocyte cm compared to wt non-tg astrocyte cm
 <cit> . our results differ from this study, however, in that they provide no evidence for mn death through increased apoptosis of mn progenitors or mns: nuclear fragmentation was not increased by sod1-g93a cm, nor do we observe a significant decrease in olig2+ mn progenitor cells or mns in tg sod1-g93a astrocyte cm compared to the baseline level in the presence of control non-conditioned medium. why might our findings differ from this study, that demonstrated neurotoxicity by sod1-g93a astrocytes mediated through the recruitment of the bax-dependent death machinery? notably, in our study, we analysed the effects of sod1-g93a cm at an earlier time-point. potentially, then, the neurotoxic effects of sod1-g93a cm are realised later than the effects we examine here. while we cannot exclude the possibility that cell-death  contributes to the reduced numbers of mn progenitor cells, our data indicate that the mutant sod1-g93a in astrocytes affects a secretory mechanism/product which renders the cm less supportive/trophic to mn-progenitors, potentially affecting either olig2+ cell-proliferation or olig2+ cell-survival. thus, the beneficial effect observed with wt non-tg cm is likely due to the presence of a supportive factor that is absent or reduced from the tg sod1-g93a cm.

we also determined whether the effects of tg sod1-g93a and wt non-tg astrocyte cm were specific to mns and their progenitor cells by examining the effect on lhx1/5+/hb9- interneurons. both the tg sod1-g93a and wt non-tg cm were as trophic/supportive to interneurons as the control medium indicating that mutant sod1-g93a in astrocytes did not affect interneurons and that the effects of wt non-tg and tg sod1-g93a astrocyte cm were selective for mns and mn progenitor cells. this is in agreement with nagai et al. who reported no effects on primary spinal gabaergic or dorsal root ganglion neurons and es cell-derived interneurons grown in sod1-g93a compared to non-tg astrocyte cm
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
astrocytes are actively implicated in the neurodegeneration in als. the exact mechanisms by which mutant sod <dig> in astrocytes can exert negative effects on mns and mn-progenitors still remain obscure, although existing evidence indicates that astrocytes exert their effects on mns through several different mechanisms. our study extends current knowledge by showing a negative effect of the sod1-g93a mutation on olig2+ mn-progenitor cells, possibly revealing new mechanisms of mn loss at the early stages of mn development.
