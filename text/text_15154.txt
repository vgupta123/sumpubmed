BACKGROUND
the last decade has brought major improvements in the treatment of cancers, but in spite of the efficacy of the cytostatic drugs, in time, cells adopt several cellular and molecular alterations, acquiring resistance. in colorectal cancer  the 5 years survival rate remains lower than 10% in patients with metastasis, mainly due to resistance to the cytostatic drugs  <cit> , regardless of the use of targeted molecular therapies in addition to standard chemotherapeutic regimens. the major treatment for metastatic cc is represented by 5-fluorouracil  and oxaliplatin . while 5fu inhibits thymidylate synthase during dna replication  <cit> , l-ohp acts as a bifunctional alkylating agent, covalently binding dna and forming platinum-dna adducts  <cit> . the intrastrand cross-links formed by l-ohp being the most abundant lesions capable of blocking both replication and transcription of dna, they are considered to cause the major cytotoxic lesions and being directly involved in the cancer cells death  <cit> .

l-ohp   platinum , a third generation platinum analogue, is the first compound that have proved to be efficient in the treatment of cc in patients displaying resistance to cisplatin  and carboplatin   <cit> . although the response rate to current systemic therapies is 50% resistance develops in almost all patients  <cit> , limiting the drug’s therapeutic potential. cells become resistant to platinum-based drugs through reduced cellular uptake, impaired dna adducts formation, alterations in dna repair genes such as ercc <dig> and xrcc <dig> and modifications in the levels of copper transporters   <cit> .

although in the last decade the gene expression profiling of human cancer cells provided valuable insight into the molecular targets of chemoresistance, the mechanisms involved in l-ohp resistance of cc are still poorly understood and the cellular and molecular alterations are not completely recognized.

our study proposed to identify and describe some of the cellular and molecular alterations that occurred in cc cell lines with induced chemoresistance to l-ohp. in an earlier study, aiming to evaluate the differences in the behavior of the cells selected for l-ohp resistance compared to the sensitive ones, we assessed the cytotoxicity, apoptosis and induction of dna damages by l-ohp in colo <dig> cc cell line. we found lower toxicity, cellular death and fewer dna damages, in the cells treated previously with l-ohp as compared to the parental ones  <cit> . in the present study we performed a comparative study on two cc cell lines  with identical origins  and their l-ohp resistant counterparts  obtained by prolonged exposure to l-ohp. in addition, we analyzed the cells’ morphological features, dna cross-links formation and the gene expression profiles. the dna cross-links induction by l-ohp was determined indirectly with alkaline comet assay , by introducing single strand breaks via ionizing radiation. the reduction of the single strand-breaks produced by the ionizing radiation in the cells treated with l-ohp quantitatively reflected the cross-links induced by the platinum compound. gene expression profiling and subsequent validations with quantitative real-time pcr  were conducted in order to identify the molecular targets and pathways altered during chemoresistance acquirement. finally, a comparative study was performed between the functions and pathways modulated by l-ohp treatment in the tested cell lines, in order to identify some common patterns of chemoresistance in ccs.

this study demonstrated that prolonged treatment with l-ohp induces several cellular and molecular targets and pathways, which lead to chemoresistance, but these alterations may differ consistently, even if the origins of the tested cell lines were identical. results converged to the conclusion that cc cells change their morphology and cytotoxicity and react differently to l-ohp therapy by activating genes and upstream regulators that resulted in a more primitive, invasive and migratory, therefore more resistant phenotype. by the identification and description of the cellular and molecular alterations that occurred during the chemoresistance acquiring process the present study aims to contribute to a better understanding of this multifactorial process essential in our attempt to reverse chemoresistance and to identify potential targets for future therapies.

RESULTS
morphology analysis
the microscopic analysis revealed distinct morphologic features for the cells with acquired resistance to l-ohp as compared to the parental ones. some of the colo320r cells have lost their globular shapes and became fusiforme and adherent, contrasting to the suspension-type parental ones. ht-29r cells displayed loss of cell polarity, the mainly polygonal cells becoming fusiforme, through several oblong transitional forms. an increased cell-to-cell distance between the adherent ht-29r cells was observed and the presence of pseudopodia in both of the resistant cell lines  .

cytotoxicity assessment
the cytotoxicity of l-ohp on the selected cc cell lines was calculated using a sigmoid-type non-linear regression method.  <dig>   and  <dig>  -fold increases of ic <dig> values were recorded in colo320r and ht-29r cell lines, respectively . the significantly higher ic <dig> values obtained for the l-ohp-treated cells vs their parental analogues confirmed the induction of chemoresistance in both of the tested cell lines. we also found that, at the same dose range, colo <dig> was almost 3-fold more sensitive to l-ohp than ht- <dig> cell line .

values are means ± sem in triplicate, in  <dig> separate experiments, after 24 h exposure of the cells to varying concentrations of l-ohp .

evaluation of the dna cross-links induced by l-ohp
the lesion scores  calculated in ca revealed that irradiation of the parental cells at a dose of 2 gy caused important dna strand-breaks, colo <dig> being more radiosensitive than ht- <dig>  , i.e. more affected by this genotoxic agent.

the exposure of these cells to different concentrations of l-ohp prior to irradiation reduced significantly the length of the comet tails, due to the formation of l-ohp-dna cross-links. this reduction was significant and dose-dependent in colo <dig> , for both concentrations of the drug; for ht- <dig> this reduction was less important  .

the l-ohp resistant cells displayed different responses to these treatments, compared to their sensitive counterparts. irradiation with 2 gy produced insignificant increases in the ls for both cell lines. preliminary experiments showed that 50 μg/ml l-ohp did not cause dna damages in the resistant variants, neither in the drug-treated and irradiated nor in the corresponding drug-treated non-irradiated samples . therefore, we increased the dose of irradiation  and the concentration of l-ohp . 4 gy caused significant dna lesions in ht-29r cell line  as compared to control, but these effects were not observable in colo320r . the administration of l-ohp  prior to irradiation did not modify notably the ls in ht-29r, serving as a proof for the acquired drug-resistance. in colo320r, the administered l-ohp  still provoked cross-links  .

gene expression profiles in the tested cells
in order to identify the molecular changes that occurred during the resistance acquiring process in cc cells, we performed class comparison analysis of the parental cell lines  and their resistant counterparts . using an m value cut-off of  <dig>   and an adjusted p value <  <dig> , we found  <dig> de genes in colo320r vs colo <dig>  representing  <dig> % of the analyzed genes. applying the same criteria of selection, we identified  <dig> de genes in ht-29r vs ht- <dig> . of the total number of de genes modulated by l-ohp in colo320r,  <dig>  were up regulated and  <dig>  were down regulated. in ht29r we identified  <dig>  over expressed and  <dig>  under expressed genes out of  <dig>  as shown in venn diagram , although the percentages of the de genes induced by l-ohp in the tested cell lines were comparable our results revealed that  <dig> genes were modulated exclusively in colo320r and  <dig> genes in ht-29r. only a set of  <dig> genes  was identified as commonly modulated by l-ohp in both cell lines. as  <dig> sequences were uncharacterized, we removed them from further analysis. finally, we observed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> common genes had different profiles in the two cell lines, while  <dig> genes exhibited similar profiles .

classes a and b represent up- respectively down-regulated genes induced by l-ohp in colo320r and ht-29r. classes c and d include antagonist de genes induced by l-ohp in the tested cell lines.

identification of the biological pathways modulated by l-ohp
in order to assess the molecular functions and canonical pathways  <cit>  modulated by l-ohp in the tested cell lines we performed the ipa core analysis.  <dig> out of  <dig> de genes in colo320r and  <dig> out of  <dig> de genes in ht-29r were mapped in ikb. the most significant cellular and molecular functions affected by l-ohp in colo320r and ht-29r cell lines were related to cell death and survival, cellular growth and proliferation, dna replication, cellular movement and cell-to-cell signaling. the analysis of the canonical pathways revealed  <dig> and  <dig> canonical pathways significantly modulated by l-ohp in colo320r and ht-29r  cell lines, respectively .

identification of upstream regulators induced by l-ohp
using ipa upstream regulator analysis, we identified  <dig> upstream regulators and their target molecules in ht-29r dataset. eight modulators were predicted to be “activated”  while  <dig> modulators were predicted as “inhibited”  in response to l-ohp treatment. these regulators were involved in transcription, enzyme activity and signal transduction . we also used ipa network overlay function to investigate the relationships between these upstream regulators and their target genes . conversely, we didn’t find significant upstream regulators in colo320r dataset.

validation of microarray results by qrt-pcr
in order to assess the reliability of microarray results, we considered  <dig> de genes as candidates for validation by qrt-pcr as following:  <dig> common genes modulated in both cell lines ,  <dig> genes modulated exclusively in colo320r  and  <dig> in ht29r  cell lines, respectively . the qrt-pcr results were consistent with the microarray data. a significant and strong correlation was found between the microarray and qrt-pcr data for both colo <dig>  and ht <dig>  cell lines .

discussion
oxaliplatin has antitumoral activity against colorectal, breast, gastric, renal carcinomas and sarcomas  <cit>  mainly by forming intrastrand cross-links that block dna replication and transcription. despite the improvements in the treatment outcome for cc, the tumor cells acquire resistance in time, decreasing the drug’s clinical efficiency.

to address this issue we assessed the morphology, cytotoxicity, dna cross-links induction and gene expression profiles of two colorectal cell lines with identical origins  with acquired resistance to l-ohp and their parental lines. according to our results the l-ohp resistant cells displayed altered cellular and molecular features as compared to the parental cells. in addition, notable differences were recorded between the functions and pathways modulated by l-ohp in the two tested cell lines.

some of the morphological alterations we observed here: pseudopodia formation and adoption of fusiforme shape, suggesting an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and an increased cell-to-cell distance in the ht-29r cells were also identified by yang et al. in chemoresistant ht- <dig> cells  <cit> . part of the embryonic development, emt appears to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis  <cit> , a process through which cells switch from the proliferative state to a more primitive, invasive and migratory mode. this conversion was proposed as a potential mechanism through which cells become chemoresistant, being known that the cytostatic drugs are more efficient on the highly proliferative cells  <cit> . in our study colo320r cells displayed  different characteristics after prolonged treatment with l-ohp. these cells, usually exposed in suspension, reacted to the prolonged treatment with the cytostatic drug by showing an increased tendency of adherence. although our findings demonstrated different adaptations of the tested cell lines to the l-ohp treatment, a common feature was obvious: the alteration of the cellular adhesion complexes, suggesting higher invasiveness and attachment capacity.

the ic <dig> values obtained in the present study revealed that the prolonged treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations of the drug, up to the clinically relevant concentration , induced resistance in the treated cells as compared to the parental ones. our results are comparable to other previous findings on parental and resistant colo <dig> cells  <cit>  and on sensitive colo <dig> and ht- <dig> cells  <cit> .

the ca findings confirmed different behaviors of the tested cell lines to the prolonged treatment to l-ohp. both parental cell lines were sensitive to 2 gy of gamma irradiation and displayed consistent dna damages. the administration of l-ohp prior to irradiation revealed higher cross-links formation in the colo <dig> cell line as compared to ht- <dig>  these results are in agreement with the cytotoxicity findings which suggested that colo <dig> cell line is more sensitive to l-ohp than ht- <dig>  an intriguing fact was the lack of response to the same dose of ionizing radiation  in the chemoresistant cell groups. moreover, the higher dose of irradiation  caused dna lesions only in ht-29r cells, while colo320r remained unresponsive. these results suggest that acquired resistance to a chemotherapeutic agent could have activated general resistance pathways that impart resistance to multiple agents, including irradiation. another potential explanation for the lack of the response to irradiation could be the presence of some free radical scavengers that might have contributed to the resistance to irradiation. the redox homeostasis of the cells was previously implicated in chemo-resistance. it is commonly accepted that the sensitivity of tumor cells to l-ohp, can be influenced by gluthatione and gluthatione related enzymes  <cit> . thus, gluthatione s-tranferase  catalyses the conjugation of gluthatione to genotoxic compounds, preventing dna-damage and adduct formation  <cit> . gluthatione system limits the cytotoxic activity of oxaliplatin by modifying the production of cellular reactive species   <cit> . if ros production decreases, also the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapy agent decreases. additionally, ros act also as critical mediators in ionizing radiation-induced cell killing  <cit> . moreover, some subsets of tumor cells were shown to possess lower levels of ros and enhanced ros defense, which contributed to their radioresistance  <cit> . therefore, a link between redox homeostasis and cells’ resistance to chemo/radiotherapy is conceivable. given that this subset of cells, with increased radioresistance was ascertained as cancer stem cells , we can presume that another cause of the cells’ peculiar response to ionizing irradiation could be the phenotypic characteristics of the cells. resistant cells in our study have switched their morphology, as our microscopy findings suggest it. it is also possible that this population might have adopted stem-like characters. literature data sustain that cancer stem cells , expressing cd133+ marker manifest resistance to irradiation with  <dig>  5 gy unlike cd133- non stem-cells  <cit> . this different behavior was explained by the activation of the dna damage checkpoint more efficiently in csc than in tumor cells without stem cells properties, due to the activation of chk <dig> and chk <dig> checkpoint kinases  <cit> . we also demonstrated in the present study the phosphorylation of chk <dig> and p <dig>  due to activation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene atm, this being activated by an apoptosis caspase activation inhibitor . activation of aven being evident in colo320r cell line and not in ht-29r may be a possible explanation for the differential behavior of these cells as compared to ht-29r . the significantly different gene expression profiles of the tested cell lines, sustained also by cytotoxicity suggest that these cells have completely different genomic patterns, which may explain also their different behavior towards gamma irradiation. the fact that in colo320r cell line we still could detect cross-links confirms once more the higher sensitivity of this cell line to l-ohp as compared to ht- <dig>  in a previous study we observed changes in the comet tails length according to the degree of the treatment with l-ohp, indicating the presence or absence of the dna cross-links induced by l-ohp on the tested cell lines  <cit> . in another study we induced standardized dna strand breaks via ionizing irradiation and compared the cross-links formation capacity of l-ohp vs cddp in  <dig> cc cell lines   <cit> . our results showed higher cytotoxicity and cross-links formation for l-ohp vs cddp in the tested cell lines, in spite of lower cellular uptake. in the present study, we determined indirectly the cross-links formation on the irradiation-damaged dna and demonstrated that l-ohp resistant cells form fewer cross-links than the parental ones, in accordance with the sensitivity of the tested cells to the cytotoxic drug. similar studies were performed by others treating with cddp the healthy human leukocytes  <cit>  and ovarian carcinoma cells  <cit>  and using l-ohp treatment on lymphocytes and lung carcinoma cell lines  <cit> . these studies used uv-c, methyl methanesulfonate and ionizing radiations, respectively, as dna strand-breaking agents and detected dna cross-links using an in vitro measure of the cells’ chemosensitivity to the tested compounds.

our microarray data were in agreement with the morphology, cytotxicity and dna lesions findings showing that the prolonged treatment with l-ohp triggered different patterns in the transcriptional profiles of the two tested cell lines. to our knowledge, there are no similar studies to highlight the differences between the molecular patterns of these two resistant cell lines however there are genomics studies that evaluated the resistance to treatment either in colo <dig> or ht- <dig>  <cit> . considering the common origin of these cell lines  and the mechanism of action of l-ohp which blocks dna replication and transcription through the formation of intra-strand dna adducts, we would expect at least to some extent, similar molecular and cellular behavior. surprisingly, our microarray data have revealed only a common core set of  <dig> genes modulated more than  <dig> -fold in both cell lines  of which just  <dig> genes exhibited similar profiles . these results could be partly explained by the distinct morphology  and by the intrinsic differences of the two cell lines which emphasize the complexity of the processes that control the resistance acquirement to this cytostatic drug. our data revealed that l-ohp modulates genes involved in the regulation of some critical mechanisms including dna replication, cell death and survival, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction.

the microarray analysis showed upregulation of keratin  <dig>  and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type o , both being involved in apoptosis. the microarray results validated by qrt-pcr confirmed a significant overexpression of these genes in both ht-29r and colo320r . krt <dig> was previously identified as being upregulated in colon carcinoma cells  <cit> . increased krt <dig> expression has been reported to inhibit cytokine-induced death of cervical cancer cells  <cit>  but there are no evidences about the role of krt <dig> in l-ohp-induced resistance in cc. ptpro is a member of family of receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases with multiple tissue-specific functions including inhibition of cell proliferation and promoting of apoptosis. ptpro was identified as a target gene of wnt/β-catenin signaling  <cit>  and a novel regulator of erbb <dig> signaling for mammary epithelial transformation  <cit> . ramaswamy et al. observed increased expression of ptpro in breast cancer following the treatment with tamoxifen  <cit> . in cc there are no studies describing the implication of ptpro in drug resistance, but this gene was found to be methylated in colon tumors  <cit> .

the core set of common de genes also included some members of interferon - inducible transmembrane gene , whose transmembrane proteins are involved in the homotypic cell adhesion functions of interferon   <cit> . we identified significant upregulation of ifitm <dig>  ifitm4p and ifih <dig> in ht29r and downregulation of these genes in colo320r . the overexpression of iftim <dig> is related to an increased proliferation and metastasis of human colon cancer cells. andreu et al. identified high endogenous levels of ifitm <dig> in ht <dig> cells with apc mutated gene  <cit> . the authors demonstrated that induction of wild-type apc causes a reduction on iftim <dig> genes within 24 hours. in another study, ghaleb et al. demonstrated that ifitm <dig> transcription is dependent on activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling, in intestinal epithelium  <cit> . this study appears to be in concordance with our results. analyzing the canonical pathways for both cell lines we noticed an increased activity for wnt/β-catenin signaling in ht29r but not in colo320r . these findings support the morphological observations which suggest an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ht-29r cells.

n-myc downstream regulated  <dig>  gene had a conflicting expression in the two cell lines, being overexpressed in colo320r and underexpressed in ht-29r . qrt-pcr confirmed upregulation of ndrg <dig> in colo320r and downregulation in ht-29r as a result of prolonged treatment with l-ohp . the protein encoded by ndrg <dig> is implicated in p53-mediated caspase activation and apoptosis. strzelczyk et al. showed correlation between low levels of ndrg <dig> gene expression and poor prognosis and survival for patients with cc  <cit> . these results could suggest that lower level of ndrg <dig> in ht29r than in colo320r could be related to a more resistant phenotype.

in response to treatment with cytostatic drugs, cells undergo apoptosis according to the drug-induced dna damage and the cells’ capacity of dna repair and survival. in colo320r, the apoptotic process was mediated by genes involved in caspase modulation and cell cycle regulation. our results showed that apoptosis caspase activation inhibitor , galectin- <dig>  and nucleolar protein  <dig>  were overexpressed in this cell line. aven represents an activator for ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene  which has an important role in the repair of dna breaks  <cit> . cell-cycle arrest induced by dna damage depends on activation of atm protein kinase, which phosphorylates cell-cycle effectors such as chek <dig> and p <dig> in order to inhibit cell-cycle progression. lgals <dig> and nol <dig> are known as downregulators of the enzyme activities of caspase  <dig>  caspase  <dig> and tumor protein p <dig>  lgals <dig> is involved in the resistance of human colon cancers by blocking the death-inducing signaling complex  formation and recruitment of the apoptosis-initiating protease, procaspase- <dig>  <cit> . conversely, the increased expression of nol <dig> reduced the trail-induced apoptosis in sw <dig> cc cells  <cit> . we observed an inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a  and wnt inhibitory factor  <dig>  tumor suppressor genes in colo320r following the l-ohp treatment. the lack of function of these genes was associated with tumor cell progression  <cit> .

in addition to the inhibition of apoptosis, our results pointed out to the activation of the mechanisms involved in promoting cell survival and tumor progression in colo320r. we observed overexpression of insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase  <dig> , fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog , inhibitor of dna binding  <dig> genes , involved especially in signal transduction on map kinase cascade. our data are in agreement with the literature data concerning the role and implication of these molecules in cc  <cit> . we also noticed downregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ  in colo320r. inhibition of pparg promotes the cell proliferation and leads to the expression of c-myc and cyclin d <dig> genes as well as of the beta-catenin protein in the colon epithelium  <cit> .

as we underlined above, the genes evidenced with microarray analysis were quite different between the two tested cell lines, therefore we expected apoptosis in ht-29r to be modulated by a different set of genes compared to those identified for colo320r. the ineffective induction of apoptosis in ht-29r cell line was mediated by genes involved in bcl- <dig> modulation. one of these genes, serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase  <dig>  is involved in phosphorylation and inactivation of the apoptotic transcription factor forkhead box o <dig> , that upregulates death receptor components such as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10 b  and proapoptotic bcl- <dig> proteins such as pim  <cit> . another member of bcl- <dig> family upregulated in ht-29r cell line, xiap associated factor  <dig> , has an important role in modulation of apoptosis in tumor cells by inhibiting the caspase- <dig> activity  <cit> .

we also noticed that the l-ohp resistance in ht-29r was promoted by the overexpression of some important modulators involved in cell proliferation such as: midkine , cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer  <dig> , proliferating cell nuclear antigen , transforming growth factor beta  <dig> , spleen tyrosine kinase  and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig> . upregulation of mdk was correlated with tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , but to our knowledge, mdk was not found to be expressed in cc. cyr <dig> has multiple roles in tumor growth, adhesion and migration, its role as positive growth-regulator in cc being previously described  <cit> . ptgs <dig> and pcna represent two important molecules for the progression of cc and treatment strategy  <cit>  and increased levels of ptgs <dig> were associated with enhanced tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenesis  <cit> .

subsequently, we paid attention to upstream regulators in attempt to explain the different phenotypes induced by l-ohp in the two tested cc cell lines. although statistically significant results were not found in colo320r, we identified  <dig> upstream regulators in ht29r, eight out of them with “activated” and two with “inhibited” predictions . among the top predicted regulators in ht29r dataset, the signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  appears to be significantly activated  by l-ohp treatment, its targets being highly enriched in the data . stat <dig> represents an important activator of transcription in cc  <cit> . the activation of stat <dig> in ht-29r was associated with an increased transcriptional activity in a large number of associated interferon-inducible genes  . we observed that stat <dig> is in turn activated by ifne, nfatc <dig> and tgm <dig>  the upregulation of stat <dig> mediated by interferon epsilon  was described on cervical cancer cells  <cit> , but to our knowledge, there are no studies describing the role of ifne in cc. nuclear factor of activated t cells  is a transcription factor with an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response. its role in cc in promoting carcinoma migration and invasion was previously demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies  <cit> . our data confirm the implication of naftc <dig> in ht-29r cc cell line as an important upstream regulator . transglutaminase  <dig>  is an enzyme involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and could mediate chemoresistance in cancer cells  <cit> . tgm <dig> was proposed by miyoshi et al. as a predictive marker for prognosis and therapeutic target in cc  <cit> . in our study, tgm <dig> was the most notably activated upstream regulator identified in ht29r cell lines  . recent studies have shown that tgm <dig> promotes drug resistance and invasion by inducing a stem cell-like phenotype in ovarian and breast cancer  <cit> . our results showed that overexpression of tgm <dig> and naftc <dig> induced tgfb <dig> activation. high level of tgfb <dig> expression in ht-29r obtained by microarray was confirmed by qrt-pcr . tgfb <dig> is a well-characterized inducer of emt in ovarian cancer and human squamous cell carcinoma cells, resulting in increased cell migration and invasion  <cit> . considering all these findings, upregulation of tgm <dig>  naftc <dig> and tgfb <dig> in ht29r but not in colo320r could explain the induction of emt and acquiring a more resistant phenotype in ht29r.

another target of tgm <dig>  poly  polymerase family member  <dig>  upstream modulator was significantly activated  in ht-29r and acts as regulator of stat <dig>  parp <dig> was identified as overexpressed in chemoresistant, diffuse large b-cell lymphomas   <cit> , but there is no data concerning the implication of parp <dig> in cc.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study cc cells adopted several cellular and molecular alterations during the prolonged treatment with l-ohp which led to resistance to this drug. l-ohp resistant cells displayed altered morphologies, higher invasiveness and metastatic capacities, lower cytotoxicities, formed fewer pt-dna cross-links and had different gene expression profiles as compared to the sensitive ones. more disrupted functions and pathways were identified in ht-29r than in colo320r cells, involving genes responsible for apoptosis inhibition, cellular proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. these findings, in agreement with the morphological and cytotoxicity results and the main upstream regulators identified for ht-29r, but not for colo320r could explain the more resistant phenotype in ht-29r than in colo320r cell line.

therefore, we can conclude that prolonged therapy with l-ohp induces different cellular and molecular chemoresistance patterns in cc cells of identical origins . the set of genes modulated by l-ohp and the upstream regulators revealed in our study explain the diverse behavior of the cancer cells to prolonged therapy with l-ohp, moreover could help us to identify some potential means to reverse chemoresistance and consequently to improve the outcome of therapy in cc.
