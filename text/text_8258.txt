BACKGROUND
viruses present remarkable diversity regarding morphology, genomes, and proteins  <cit> . among viruses, bacteriophages  are a group of special interest, given their interactions with bacteria that are important for biotechnology and human health. as new phage genomes are characterized, unusual features are found, including new genes and novel genome architectures . thus, the study of phage diversity can contribute to the understanding of their evolution and their influence on any microbial community.

composting is a diverse microbial environment in which complex organic molecules such as lignocellulose are converted into humus-like substances suitable for use as a soil amendment  <cit> . the study of composting microbial communities is important for elucidating the pathways of biomass degradation, and has contributed to the discovery of novel microorganisms and valuable enzymes for biotechnological applications  <cit> . aside from the great diversity of bacteria and fungi species in this environment , phages have also been identified in composting material . recent studies have reported novel phage genomes in composting  <cit>  and interesting features, such as phage thermostable enzymes  <cit> .

in this work, we describe three new phages isolated from a composting operation at the sao paulo zoo park  using pseudomonas aeruginosa pa <dig> as host. this reference strain is a clinical and highly virulent isolate that represents the most common clonal group worldwide  <cit> . along with the characterization of these phages, this work also presents results concerning transcribed phage genes and phage abundance variation from a three-month time-series sampling of the composting process. to our knowledge, this is the first study to present such results concerning the complex microbial context in which these phages live.

RESULTS
phage isolation and sequencing
we screened composting samples from the são paulo zoo park   <cit>  for phages infecting pseudomonas aeruginosa pa <dig>  in order to access a slice of the cultivable phage diversity in this complex microbial community. three new phages were isolated, which we named pseudomonas phage zc <dig>  zc <dig> and zc <dig>  their genomes were fully sequenced, assembled, and annotated. overall characteristics of these phage genomes are summarized in table  <dig>  a final genome of  <dig>  bp was obtained for phage zc <dig>  which was linearized following phage yua reference and close genomes  <cit> . assemblies for isolates zc <dig> and zc <dig> resulted in two slightly different sequences with  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. for all three phage genomes, coverage was above 8000x and uniform through the entire contig. metrics about the assembly process are available in the additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> new phages genomic features

genomic features of the three new pseudomonas phages described in this work




genomic and functional characterization of phage zc01
the majority of the zc <dig> genome consists of coding sequences, with the exception of three main non-coding regions: 370 bp at the 5’ end, 249 bp around the  <dig> kbp position and 933 bp around the  <dig> kbp position. a common characteristic for these non-coding regions is their lower gc content  compared to the average gc content for the entire zc <dig> genome . this variation is due to an increase of t nucleotides from a mean value of 16% in the genome to up to 37% in these non-coding regions.

we have searched the national center for biotechnology information  nt and microbial refseq genomes databases  <cit>  for genomes similar to phage zc <dig>  the most similar genomes include phage ab <dig> , phage pamx <dig>  and phage yua   <cit> . phage yua belongs to the yua-like virus genus of the siphoviridae family  <cit> . based on this information, we have created a new cluster of viral genomes in the viral orthologous clusters database   <cit> , which was named siphoviridae yua-like and is publicly available through the vocs java client  <cit> . genomes in the yua-like cluster were selected using blastn  <cit>  results and the jaccard index of similarity based on shared genes, as detailed in the methods section. clusters created in this study are not meant to reflect strict taxonomy groups, but similarity through shared genes only. this cluster contains  <dig> different genomes ,  <dig> genes and  <dig> ortholog groups .table  <dig> phage genomes assigned to siphoviridae yua-like and podoviridae n4-like vocs clusters

all ten most conserved genes in the yua-like cluster have orthologous representatives in phage zc <dig> . likewise, conserved dna helicase, recd-like protein, deoxyuridylate hydroxymethyltransferase and dna polymerase a were annotated and assigned to ortholog groups with six or more orthologous genes. due to the high similarity among phages zc <dig>  ab <dig> and pamx <dig>  there are  <dig> ortholog groups shared by them only. these include well-known proteins such as a holin and a dna ligase, but also several hypothetical proteins. moreover, phages ab <dig> and zc <dig> share two specific ortholog groups , which were annotated as hypothetical and have no similarity with anything else in the ncbi nr database. their function remains to be discovered. in addition, we found in the zc <dig> genome a gene coding for a protein that is the only member of the vocs ortholog group  <dig>  the predicted protein is the rz <dig> smaller lipoprotein. it was manually annotated through the inspection of the rz larger lipoprotein orf . this annotation was based on similar findings for the lambda phage genome, where rz <dig> was experimentally isolated and characterized  <cit> . we verified that zc <dig>  ab <dig> and pamx <dig> share orthologous proteins to the rz larger lipoprotein ; therefore, we conclude that the rz <dig> smaller nested lipoprotein is also encoded in ab <dig> and pamx <dig> genomes, but it was not annotated .table  <dig> list of the  <dig> most conserved ortholog groups in the siphoviridae yua-like cluster

functional annotation of the predicted proteins based on vocs clusters context and additional tools showed that 41% of zc <dig> proteins have unknown function. “dna metabolism and replication” and “structural proteins” are the functional categories with most genes. few protein products were annotated as involved in host interaction pathways, e.g., membrane or cell wall interaction and metabolism regulation. zc <dig> genome annotation is summarized in fig.  <dig>  detailed annotation of the zc <dig> genome and genes is presented as additional file 3: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> phage zc <dig> genome plot. circular representation of the pseudomonas phage zc <dig> genome. the outer circle represents genes . putative functional categories were defined according to annotation and are represented by colors. gaps in the functional block circle represent proteins with unknown function. the central graph  shows genomic gc content variation computed in 100 bp windows




genomic and functional characterization of phages zc <dig> and zc08
phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> present very similar genomes, with 95% of their nucleotide sequences aligned averaging 98% identity. differences are mainly due to two indels at the  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp positions. the first indel consist of a unique sequence  present in phage zc <dig>  while the second indel consists of a unique sequence  present in phage zc <dig> 

zc <dig> and zc <dig> non-coding regions also present variation on the gc content. however, in contrast to zc <dig>  the zc <dig> and zc <dig> non-coding regions display an increase in the gc content  with respect to the average cg content of the genome . the average gc content from phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> significantly diverges from the gc content of the assumed host genome , suggesting that p. aeruginosa may not be the optimal host for these two phages  <cit> .

blastn searches of zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes against the ncbi refseq database returned hits with low genomic coverage and identity. the best hits included enterobacteria phage n <dig> , erwinia phage ea9- <dig>  and enterobacteria phage ime <dig> . these results strongly indicate that phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> are rather different from known phage species and that they probably belong to a new genus in the podoviridae family. for this reason, creating a cluster of similar genomes in this case was challenging due to the shortage of similar genomes. phage n <dig> is the most similar known genome and also the only officially representative of a genus recognized by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses , the n4-like-virus  <cit> . notwithstanding, several phages have been reported as strongly related to this genus, including pseudomonas, escherichia and achromobacter phages  <cit> . thus, considering blastn results and the jaccard index of similarity to select phage genomes, we created a new cluster of viruses in the vocs database, which we named podoviridae n4-like cluster. ten different genomes were selected to be part of this cluster , comprising  <dig> genes and  <dig> ortholog groups. data for the yua-like, n4-like and a third model cluster for t4-like myophages are publicly available through the vocs java client at the viral bioinformatics resource center  web platform  <cit> .

the zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes harbor representatives from all the  <dig> core genes found for the n4-like cluster, or  <dig> core genes for the n4-like genus according to the literature  <cit> . these genes include rna polymerases  <dig> and  <dig>  dna helicase, dna polymerase, primase, exonuclease, terminase small and large subunits and coat proteins .table  <dig> list of the  <dig> most conserved ortholog groups in the podoviridae n4-like cluster

forty-four genes were assigned to specific zc03/zc <dig> ortholog groups, corresponding to more than half of the full set of genes in each genome. zc <dig> and zc <dig> genes are very different from gene sequences available in public databases, indicating the high degree of novelty of these genomes. among these  <dig> specific genes, only two products could be annotated: a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase gp <dig>  and a putative homing endonuclease . zc <dig> genome contains six unique genes and an additional trna gene that is not present in the zc <dig> genome . on the other hand, zc <dig> presents five unique genes that are not present in the zc <dig> genome. given the evidence, we hypothesize that these two phages have diverged in the recent evolutionary past.

functional annotation of the predicted proteins for phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> based on vocs clusters context and other tools showed that approximately 50% of the predicted proteins have unknown function. zc03/zc <dig> genome annotation and features are summarized in fig.  <dig>  for a complete list of evidence and annotation, see additional file 4: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> phage zc <dig> genome plot. linear representation of the pseudomonas phage zc <dig> genome. the two central bands represent genes being codified by the plus strand  or minus strand . putative functional categories were defined according to annotation and are represented by colors in the top strand. gaps in the functional blocks band represent proteins with unknown function. the bottom purple graph shows gc content variation computed in 100 bp windows. hairpin symbol shows genome region where trna genes were predicted. ins/del regions are shown comparing zc <dig> and zc <dig> phages




zc <dig> and zc <dig> specific genes and differences
given their overall similarity, the differences between the zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes can help in the understanding of viral evolution. major differences include one gene region  with lower nucleotide identity than its neighborhood  and three indel regions encoding several genes .table  <dig> phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> specific genes


ahits were considered weak hits if the alignment presented coverage >=  <dig>  and identity >= 20% through hmm or pssm searches




the genes zc03_ <dig> and zc08_ <dig> were annotated as hypothetical proteins, although blastp results show similarity  with a tail assembly protein of xylella phage salvo . genes zc03_ <dig> and zc08_ <dig> were assigned to separate individual vocs ortholog groups, likely because their encoded amino acid sequences present only 29% identical residues in a full alignment. multiple alignment of the genomes indicates a syntenic relationship between these genes, providing additional evidence for the hypothesis that they are distant orthologs.

zc <dig> presents a cassette of genes that might have been originated from a horizontal gene transfer event. five genes  are encoded by this region, and most of them were annotated as hypothetical. weak hits suggest functions for the genes as shown in table  <dig>  but such evidence was not considered enough for a robust annotation. the only annotated gene in the cassette is a drpa-like dna recombination mediator. other two indels events consist of unique sequences in zc <dig> that encode one putative hnh homing endonuclease  and three hypothetical proteins, respectively . details of the homing endonuclease insertion region will be discussed later in this work.

trnas and codon bias
most phages in the n4-like group present one to three trnas genes that are not encoded by the host genome. in this group, there are pseudomonas phages without any trna genes while some salmonella phages harbor  <dig> or more genes for several trnas  <cit> . in this regard, phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> are the first pseudomonas n4-related phages to carry trnas genes. analysis of the zc <dig> and zc <dig> trna genes revealed anti-codons for seven different amino acids, with proline and leucine present twice. the prediction software could not accurately assign the anti-codon for one zc <dig> trna gene, which also happens to be the one missing in zc <dig> genome. it seems that the equivalent region to this trna gene in zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes may have accumulated enough substitutions to produce a pseudo trna gene .

we analyzed codon usage for phage zc <dig> and the host p. aeruginosa pa <dig> proteins. table  <dig> shows predicted codons concerning zc <dig> and zc <dig> trnas and usage bias for each codon among all the codons for the same amino acid. the results show that trnas carried by the phage correspond to codons rarely used by the host. there is even an extreme case for the codon uua  whose trna is not encoded by p. aeruginosa pa <dig> genome. this data corroborates reports in the literature, suggesting that a selective recruitment of trnas compensates for the compositional differences between phage and host genomes  <cit> . the only exceptions to this pattern seem to be the trnas for asparagine and methionine, which do not present any detectable bias.table  <dig> codon usage for phage zc <dig> and p. aeruginosa pa14



athe anti-codon for one trna could not accurately be predicted, and, therefore, this might be a trnaval pseudogene




we have investigated proteins with high frequency of proline/leucine and proteins with high usage of the nine codons corresponding to the trnas carried by the phages. these were an rz lipoprotein , a putative class ii holin , two putative homing endonucleases , one hypothetical protein containing a cellulase-like domain , plus some hypothetical proteins . some studies have shown that highly translated mrnas encoding important proteins to the organism are less susceptible to codon negative bias and wobble base-pairing, since the translation on those cases could be less efficient  <cit> . in this context, the presence of trna genes may be related with phage virulence to ensure optional translation of late genes and faster lytic cycle, as previously suggested in  <cit> . thus, it seems that the genes listed above might be especially important for phage lytic activity. by all means, a more detailed investigation is necessary to corroborate the linkage between presence of trna genes in phage genomes and their virulence.

homing endonucleases insertion region
homing endonucleases  are site-specific dna endonucleases encoded by genes inside mobile elements such as self-splicing introns and inteins . these mobile elements can insert themselves within conserved genes without altering their function due to their posterior self-splicing activity at the rna or protein level  <cit> . they undergo a life cycle that starts with the invasion of a population, continues with the spreading through individuals, and ends when the element is fixed and is no longer under positive selection. at this point, the homing endonuclease gene  sequence degenerates and loses its function through random processes  <cit> .

hes are commonly found in phage genomes, with reports indicating up to  <dig> genes in phage t <dig>  <cit> . although, phage t <dig> is thought to be an outlier, since many t4-like viruses have been studied and they do not have as many hes. moreover, it remains a challenge to understand the influence of hes in producing phenotypes and in the mosaic evolution of phage genomes  <cit> .

at least two different hegs were identified within phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes, both resembling endonucleases from the hnh family  <cit> . the homing endonucleases insertion region and he-containing genes in phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> are listed in the additional file 7: table s <dig>  figure  <dig> shows a genome plot of this region, where one can observe a common element equally inserted within an atpase-domain-containing protein  of  <dig> aa in zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes. because of the insertion, this protein was predicted as two separated pieces, and multiple alignment of orthologous proteins in the n4-like cluster  indicates that zc <dig> and zc <dig> are the only genomes to present an he within this orf. searches of the fusion protein against the reference proteome hmmer database of hmms  <cit>  suggest that the protein is a ribonucleotide reductase. similar cases of he disrupting conserved ribonucleotide reductase genes were reported for phage aeh <dig> and twort  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hnh endonuclease insertion region. comparison of the hnh endonuclease insertion region in zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes. blue lines in the top strand are substitutions, the red block represents the he element insertion in zc <dig> only and blank spaces are identical aligned regions. adcp: atpase domain containing protein




the second he is inserted within the rna polymerase  subunit  <dig> gene in zc <dig> genome only . zc <dig> specific he was assigned to the ortholog group vocs id: <dig>  which also contains two other proteins from phages g7c  and ee36p <dig> . however, this homolog he element is inserted in a different location inside phages g7c and ee36p <dig> genomes, more specifically between the genes rnap <dig> and rnap <dig> , which encode a two-subunits rnap.

a closer investigation about the rnap genes in phages from the podoviridae family shows three organization types:  one single-unit protein of about  <dig> aa ,  two adjacent genes encoding for a two-subunits rnap , and  two genes spaced by one or more non-related canonical genes encoding a two-subunits rnap . multiple alignment of the rnap protein sequences from t7-type, n4-type and g7c-type strongly suggests that the two subunits are actually non-overlapping pieces from the larger t7-type rnap . thus, the he insertion within the rnap <dig> gene in zc <dig> genome may provide an insight to understand the evolutionary history of rna polymerases in phages.

altogether these findings suggest that single-unit and two-subunits rnaps in podoviridae may be linked by a common evolutionary pathway, as previously suggested in  <cit> . our hypothesis is that a single-unit rnap was present in the common ancestor of t7-like and n4-like phages. after these two lineages diverged, this single-unit protein was probably disrupted by the insertion of an he element in the lineage that originated the n4-like phages. since then, random events have led to two-subunits rnap genes that continue to present affinity to assemble the complex required for transcription, as was experimentally demonstrated  <cit> . although this hypothesis needs more supporting data, it is also corroborated by the comparative analysis of phage genomes from the t7-like and n4-like groups. sequence inspection shows size variations in the spacing region between rnap <dig> and rnap <dig> genes. for instance, phage g7c presents only one putative hnh endonuclease  between the rnap subunits genes, while phage ee36p <dig> presents one putative hnh endonuclease  plus seven predicted hypothetical proteins. there are examples from zero up to eight spacing genes between the rnap <dig> and rnap <dig> genes in n4-like phages.

phylogenetic analyses
we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the terminase large subunit gene  of each cluster of phages. the yua-like cluster presents three different ortholog groups for this gene  which may indicate non-orthologous or distant orthologous proteins. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated . the presence of three distinct groups, which correspond exactly to the vocs ortholog groups assignment, suggests that these sequences have long undergone separate evolutionary pathways. phages lambda and n <dig> belong to an external group, since they are phages from the siphoviridae family but from a different and closely related group .fig.  <dig> yua-like and n4-like phylogenetic trees. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the terl gene for phages in the yua-like vocs cluster. the tree was rooted by two external groups represented here by enterobacteria phage lambda  and enterobacteria phage n <dig> . b maximum likelihood unrooted phylogenetic tree based on the terl gene for phages in the n4-like vocs cluster. bootstrap values are shown close to the nodes in percentages




all terl genes from the n4-like cluster were assigned to the same ortholog group , which was also part of the n4-like core-genome. fig. 4b shows an unrooted maximum likelihood tree for phages from the n4-like group. internal nodes display weak bootstrap support, indicating that the relationships among phages inside the n4-like cluster are unresolved. however, the bootstrap values strongly support the existence of two clades, one grouping zc <dig> and zc <dig> and another grouping n4-like and related phages. this data supports the claim that phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> constitute a new genus inside the podoviridae family.

it is worth mentioning that building phylogenetic trees for phages remains a tough challenge due to the non-existence of marker genes present in all species. the terl gene represents a candidate for this purpose in the order caudovirales, but it is clearly limited by its lack of identifiable homology among families inside the order.

host range and phage morphology
as previously mentioned, the three phages under study were isolated from composting samples using p. aeruginosa pa <dig> as host. in infection assays of p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  phage zc <dig> exhibits large lysis plaques with well-defined borders and diameter of  <dig> - <dig>  mm. zc <dig> and zc <dig> present much smaller lysis plaques  than zc <dig> . the three phages formed clear plaques, which is typical for lytic  phages. given that zc03/zc <dig> probably belong to a new genus in the podoviridae family, we performed one-step growth curve experiments for zc <dig> as its archetype. the curve revealed a latent period of ~50 min with the number of phage particles reaching a peak at 240 min after infection and a calculated burst size of  <dig> phage particles per infected cell .

phage host range was evaluated using  <dig> different strains, including bacteria from well-studied genera , as well as several clinical p. aeruginosa isolates besides the reference strains pa <dig> and pao <dig>  out of these, only four p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to phage lysis . higher lysis efficiency was observed only for strains pa <dig> and h <dig>  where clear plaques appeared even in more diluted titers for all the three phages. pao <dig> strain was not susceptible to lysis. additional file 11: figure s <dig> shows images of the drop test for p. aeruginosa pa <dig> and pao <dig> reference strains. these results indicate that the new phages present a narrow host range for p. aeruginosa strains, but other yet-to-be discovered potential hosts cannot be ruled out.table  <dig> assessment of zc <dig>  zc <dig> and zc <dig> host range

morphology features for the three new phages virions were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. phage zc <dig> has the typical morphology for phages of the siphoviridae family and more specifically for phages of the yua-like group  <cit>  . we identified a prolate and more elongated head of ~80 nm by ~58 nm . tail is ~150 nm long, cross-banded, flexible and non-contractile, with a terminal structure resembling short fibers. as predicted from genomic comparisons, phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> belongs to podoviridae and as such, exhibit morphological characteristics of phages from this family . the electron micrographs show their icosahedral head of ~72 nm by ~59 nm and a short tail ~21 nm long with terminal fibers.fig.  <dig> electron micrographs of phages zc <dig>  zc <dig> and zc <dig>  transmission electron micrographs of negatively stained pseudomonas phages virions found in composting: a–c

putative cell lysis associated proteins
we have screened phage genomes for genes possibly involved in pathways of cell lysis and biomass degradation, since the lysis and turnover of bacterial cell components constitute important steps in the process of nutrients recycling  <cit> . most genes involved in cell lysis and biomass degradation in phages are responsible for breaking cell wall peptidoglycan components and making pores in the lipid membrane, which are important steps in infection or in the release of phage progeny  <cit> . nine proteins were found, including peptidoglycan hydrolases, n-acetylmuramidases, rz lipoproteins, holins and an endolysin . for example, a peptidoglycan hydrolase gp181-like  is present in both zc <dig> and zc <dig> genomes. these proteins were assigned to the ortholog group vocs id:  <dig>  which contains only these two genes and no other homologs in the n4-like cluster. we identified a central lysozyme-like domain  and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine binding sites in the protein. previous reports indicate a similar architecture for pseudomonas phage phikz gp <dig>   <cit> .table  <dig> putative cell lysis associated proteins encoded by phages zc <dig>  zc <dig> and zc08

pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm degradation
to investigate the ability of phages to mediate biofilm degradation, we challenged 24/48 hours p. aeruginosa pa <dig> biofilms with the three different phages isolated in this study. exposure to the three phages strongly reduced biofilm cell densities, mainly for phage zc <dig> . these results indicate a promising degradation potential for these three new phages against p. aeruginosa pa <dig> biofilms. this strain is highly virulent in susceptible animal hosts and known to form a biofilm structure resistant to currently available antibiotics  <cit> . in these assays we used lower phage titers  than the titers normally used in biofilm degradation assays   highlighting the antibiofilm effectiveness of these phages.fig.  <dig> biofilm degradation assay. biofilms of 24 h and 48 h were exposed to phages zc <dig>  zc <dig>  and zc <dig> for 24 h. image shows the results after exposure for each of the phages compared to the control, which was exposed to a buffer solution only. images are representative of n= <dig> replicates




phages in action: metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses in the composting process
this work is part of a project that aims to understand the composting process at the microbial and molecular levels  <cit> . in this project, time-series samples of a composting unit were obtained and corresponding dna and mrna sequence datasets were generated. as the samples from this composting unit were used for both the metagenomic and phage isolation studies, it was feasible to verify the presence of phages/host in the dna and mrna sequence datasets for each sampling day. we indeed found sequences that correspond to these genomes in all datasets and the relative abundance was inferred for phage-host populations . phages zc <dig> and zc <dig> relative abundance variation parallels that of p. aeruginosa but with an apparent delay, which is consistent with mathematical models that have been proposed for phage-host variation  <cit> . we calculated a correlation score applying the local similarity analysis  technique for time-series samples  <cit> , and a positive ls score of  <dig>  was obtained for p. aeruginosa and phages zc03/zc <dig> abundances . this data suggests that, in this environment, p. aeruginosa and phages zc03/zc <dig> may present a mutualistic relationship that is characteristic of lysogenic phages, as discussed in  <cit> . we emphasize that our experimental results show that zc <dig>  zc <dig> and zc <dig> are lytic phages in the conditions we used for cultivation in pa <dig>  additionally, we also performed lysogeny experiments and the results showed negligible frequency of lysogeny  for the three phages. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these phages could establish a mutualistic relationship with their host in different environmental conditions.fig.  <dig> phage-host relative abundance in the composting metagenome. relative abundance of metagenomic reads through the composting process. raw reads count for phages and host was divided by the total number of reads in each sample and normalized by the genome size of the organism 




we investigated active phage-related functions in the composting process through the identification of metatranscriptomic reads mapped to phage genes. fig.  <dig> shows the proportion of mrna reads identified for each day in the respective function. “structural” and “dna metabolism and replication” are the predominant phage functions expressed through the days of the composting process. we identified mrna for host lysis in the sample of day  <dig>  more specifically mrna reads for a class ii phage holin . it is interesting to note that a spike in phage abundance is also observed on day  <dig>  as well as a marked decrease in host abundance . this observation suggests a cause-effect relationship, but additional studies are necessary to gather additional evidence for this hypothesis.fig.  <dig> phage-related functions in the composting microbial community. phage-related protein functions through the composting process assessed by the identification of mrna sequences from phages and the host p. aeruginosa in time-series metatranscriptomic samples. values are shown in percentage of the total of proteins with known function




CONCLUSIONS
in this work, three new pseudomonas phages have been characterized in terms of genomic structure, genes, and the putative proteins encoded by their genomes. two of the three phages present remarkable novelty at the genomic level and may be members of a new genus in the podoviridae family. comprehensive comparative analyses of the new phages in a context with phages from yua-like and n4-like clusters provided insights about the evolution and diversity of tailed phages. moreover, infectivity and biofilm degradation experiments suggest a narrow host range and a potential as anti-microbial agents against p. aeruginosa pa <dig> infections, warranting further studies to explore this promising application. finally, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses provided data to situate phages zc <dig>  zc <dig>  and zc <dig> in the microbial community to which they belong, yielding interesting clues about phage population dynamics and phage transcript presence in this complex environment.
