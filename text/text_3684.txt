BACKGROUND
ribosomes are complex macromolecular machines that are found in abundance in all cells that are actively making proteins. two-thirds of the ribosome is composed of rna molecules  that share a high degree of conservation in primary sequence as well as in secondary and tertiary structural elements across kingdoms  <cit> . numerous nucleotide modifications, mainly but not exclusively via methylation, are found on rrnas but the functional importance of these post-transcriptional modifications remains unclear  <cit> . for example, the two adenosine residues in the loop of helix  <dig> near the 3'end of the small subunit rrna  are universally conserved, and are dimethylated by a specific enzyme belonging to the rrna adenine dimethylase family, which is represented by the e. coli ksga protein  <cit> . while these enzymes are present in all three kingdoms of life including mitochondria and chloroplasts  <cit> , a few ksga orthologs adopted additional roles within the cell, serving for example as a transcription factor in mitochondria  <cit>  or an essential ribosome biogenesis factor in yeast  <cit> . however, dimethylation is generally not essential for growth at optimal temperature.

the order chlamydiales forms a deep lineage of obligate intracellular bacteria, infecting free-living amoebae, various invertebrates and all the vertebrates, and includes four families: chlamydiaceae, parachlamydiaceae, waddliaceae, and simkaniaceae  <cit> . the chlamydiaceae are well known agents of multiple diseases in animals and in humans, with two species, c. trachomatis and c. pneumoniae, being pathogenic for humans. c. trachomatis is recognized as the most prevalent cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections worldwide and, in underdeveloped nations, is also responsible for trachoma a potentially blinding disease. c. pneumoniae is a significant agent of respiratory disease in adolescents and adults and also is associated with cardiovascular diseases. the other chlamydial species are less relevant to human medicine, although severe zoonotic diseases in humans are caused by c. psittaci, c. abortus and c. felis. species of parachlamydiaceae, waddliaceae, and simkaniaceae are also suspected to be involved in human infections  <cit> .

in addition to being obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria, all chlamydiales share a unique biphasic developmental cycle. the environmentally stable, metabolically inert and infectious elementary bodies  enter susceptible host cells and convert into the replicating and metabolically active but noninfectious reticulate bodies  inside cytoplasmic vacuoles  before converting back into ebs from  <dig> to  <dig> hours post-infection depending on the species, and exiting the host cell to repeat the cycle  <cit> . while effective antibiotic therapies are available to treat chlamydial infections, it is becoming clear that the low number of rrna operons in these bacteria presents an actual risk for emergence of resistance against the current preferred therapies of tetracycline or azithromycin  <cit> . then, similar to other bacteria, targets for the development of new antimicrobials need to be identified.

the evolution of chlamydia as an obligate intracellular pathogen has been associated with loss of genes encoding functions that became redundant within the host during the adaptation to parasitic/symbiotic lifestyles, similarly to mycoplasmas, phytoplasmas, α- and γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . sequencing data available for eleven chlamydia species reveal the presence of a ksga dimethyltransferase homolog, yet they all lack the s-adenosyl-methionine synthetase that is required for synthesis of s-adenosyl-methionine, the donor of methyl groups in all methylation reactions. this raises the question of whether the ksga homolog encodes a functional methylase in these organisms. the lack of tools for genetically manipulating chlamydia has been a major barrier to the analysis of their putative virulence genes  <cit>  and characterization of chlamydial genes has mainly relied on expression in a heterologous host system such as e. coli. in this study, we show that the chlamydial ksga protein is able to functionally replace the orthologous enzyme in e. coli, indicating that they share the same activity, i.e. specific methylation of the small subunit ribosomal rna. ksga activity conferred sensitivity to the antibiotic kasugamycin  in chlamydia, similarily to e. coli, and we were able to isolate low level ksmr mutants in c. trachomatis which contain a frameshift mutation in ksga. these mutant bacteria were severely impaired for growth, highlighting the critical role ksga plays in chlamydia biology.

RESULTS
1-characterization of the chlamydial ksga orthologs and their phylogenetic relationship with other family members
a gene encoding a protein highly similar to the dimethyltransferase ksga is present in the genomes of all sequenced chlamydia. using degenerate primers, we were amplified a  <dig> kb-genomic region of c. psittaci 6bc carrying the ksga-like gene. ksga is the second gene of a predicted bicistronic operon in chlamydia  <cit> , downstream of a gene, named ct <dig> in c. trachomatis serovar d, with no homology outside the chlamydiae lineage. ct <dig> orf shows  <dig> to 100% homology amongst the chlamydiacee and 26% with the protochlamydial pc <dig> orf which precedes the protochlamydial ksga gene.

genomic transcriptional profiling of c. trachomatis serovar d showed that both ksga and ct <dig> genes are transcribed by  <dig> hours post-infection when the bacteria are in the metabolically active stage of development  <cit> . surprisingly, while most ksga orthologs use the aug canonical translation initiation codon, an alternative ksga start codon is predicted amongst the chlamydiaceae, either gug in c. trachomatis, c. muridarum and c. pneumoniae or uug in c. psittaci 6bc, c. felis, c. caviae and c. abortus. while use of an alternative start codon usually results in low expression in e. coli, its impact on efficiency of translation in chlamydia is not known. nevertheless like e. coli, most chlamydial genes rely on aug as a start codon  <cit> .

a multiway alignment between various ksga homologs revealed  <dig> to 68% identity amongst the chlamydiaceae and at least 99% within each species, 39% with the protochlamydial homolog,  <dig> to 30% with arabidaposis thaliana, synechococcus sp., prochlorococcus sp., e. coli, rickettsia sp. and yersinia sp. ksga orthologs, and 20% with the mitochondrial transcriptional factor h-mttfb <dig> . using a refined sequence alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for these various dimethyltransferases  <cit>  . the branches representing chlamydia were similar whether nucleotide sequences  or protein sequences  were aligned. they were both comparable to the one obtained using 16s rrna and 23s rrna gene sequences  <cit>  or housekeeping gene fragments  <cit> , except that c. pneumoniae was slightly more distant in our analysis, with a strong branch support value of 86%.

the chlamydial ksga homologs, in particular the protochlamydial one, grouped with the a. thaliania chloroplastic pfc <dig>  protein, in agreement with two recent studies  <cit>  . although the evolutionary relationship between plants and chlamydia may seem surprising considering that no species of chlamydia has been reported in photosynthetic organisms, a high number of cyanobacteria- and plant-like genes in chlamydia have been identified in the different chlamydial genome sequences  <cit> . further analyses showed that many of the plant orthologs are targeted to the plastids in plants. we recently demonstrated that c. trachomatis l <dig> and p. amoebophila dapl enzymes behave similarly to the phylogenetically related plant plastidial ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase enzyme involved in the lysine biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . accordingly, we predict that the chlamydial ksga proteins should be functionally equivalent to the plastid orthologs. in addition, conservation of hallmark sequences for binding to the methyl group donor s-adenosyl-l-methionine and to the adenine ring of the nucleotide to be methylated  predict that the chlamydial ksga proteins should complement a ksga defect in e. coli, as seen previously with ksga family members  <cit> .

2-complementation of a ksga mutant of e. coli by the chlamydial ksga homologs
e. coli are naturally sensitive to ksm, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits the initial step of protein synthesis. sensitivity to ksm is in part due to the action of ksga which methylates the adenosine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the 16s rrna. . consequently, ksga mutants are resistant to ksm  <cit> . we constructed a clean deletion of ksga in e. coli mc <dig>  using the λ red recombinase method as described by datensko and wanner  <cit> . this strain, atm <dig>  was  <dig> times more resistant to ksm than the wild-type strain, with a minimal inhibitory concentration  of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> vs.  <dig> μg ml- <dig> for its parent . the ability of e. coli and c. trachomatis l <dig> ksga genes to complement the ksm resistance phenotype and restore ksm sensitivity to atm <dig> was first tested by transforming high copy number plasmids  and expressing the respective genes in the presence of  <dig> mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside . colonies formed by atm <dig> transformed with prak <dig>  were about 50% smaller than atm <dig> or atm <dig> transformed with prak <dig>  . the inhibition of growth due to overexpression of ksgal <dig> made it impractical to assess sensitivity to ksm. to address this problem we constructed isogenic strains of atm <dig> in which the copy number of the iptg-inducible ksga gene was reduced by inserting it into the chromosome at the λ-attachment site . under such conditions, we did not observe any growth inhibition associated with ksgal <dig> expression in the absence of antibiotic .

nt; not tested

expression of the native e. coli methylase in the e. coli ksga mutant  restored sensitivity to ksm as expected , with a mic of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> . similarly, expression of ksgal <dig> was able to complement for the loss of ksga in e. coli . as expected, the level of bacterial sensitivity to ksm was inversely related to the expected expression level of the recombinant protein in e. coli, lowering the mic from  <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> when the ksgal <dig> gug native start codon was replaced by the conventional aug start codon to increase the level of expression of ksgal <dig> . likewise expression of the c. psittaci 6bc ksga ortholog restored ksm sensitivity to the e. coli ksga mutant . the restoration of ksm sensitivity supports the conclusion that the chlamydial ksga homologs are able to methylate the two conserved adenosines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in e. coli 16s rrna in vivo, as has been seen previously for different ksga family members from mitochondria, bacteria and yeasts  <cit> .

the importance of ksga in ribosome maturation has been linked to the cold-sensitivity phenotype described for e. coli ksga mutants and a. thaliana pfc <dig> mutants  <cit> . nevertheless expression of ksgal <dig> in atm <dig> did not reverse the cold-sensitivity growth of the e. coli strain . we do not know if this reflects a functional disparity of the chlamydial ksga homolog or just results from partial heterologous complementation suggested by the intermediate level of ksm sensitivity exhibited by the ksgal2-complemented e. coli mutants. nevertheless, the ability of ksgal <dig> to restore some degree of sensitivity towards ksm, hence methylation of a <dig> and a <dig> in e. coli 16s rrna, suggests that the same conserved adenosine residues are methylated in chlamydia  <cit> . consequently, we explored chlamydia sensitivity to ksm.

3-inhibition of c. trachomatis l <dig> and c. psittaci 6bc growth by ksm and selection of resistant mutants
although ksm has been used clinically in the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections  <cit> , this aminoglycoside antibiotic is only currently used in agricultural protection of rice crops against the fungus pyricularia oryzae. genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses have provided insights into ksm binding and inhibition  <cit> . the drug binds to the 30s ribosomal subunits within the path of the messenger rna , overlapping both the peptidyl-trna  and exit  sites. this affects the binding of the initiator trna onto canonical mrnas and the subsequent joining of the large 50s subunits to form the translationally active 70s ribosomes. ksm is held in place by interactions with universally conserved residues a <dig> and g <dig> on the 16s rrna and although the antibiotic does not appear to interact directly with the two adenosines at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  lack of methylation in a <dig> decreases ksm binding to rrna.  <cit> . the conservation of these nucleotides in chlamydia predicts that these obligate intracellular bacteria should be sensitive to ksm, provided that both the cell and the inclusion membrane are permeable to the drug.

in our laboratory, sensitivity of chlamydia spp. to antibiotics is measured in the plaque assay and the mic is defined as the concentration of drug that inhibits the development of  <dig> plaque-forming units . the number of input bacteria corresponds to a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  in a confluent monolayer of l <dig> mouse fibroblasts in  <dig> mm dishes  <cit> . due to low intracellular penetration, aminoglycosides are considered poorly active or not active against obligate intracellular bacteria and indeed c. psittaci 6bc and c. trachomatis l <dig> mic for ksm were high, i.e.  <dig> and  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  respectively . although such elevated mics would classify the organisms as ksm resistant from a clinical stand point, we hypothesized that alterations in the drug binding site, in the ksga methylase or in the rrna methylation site would allow chlamydia to grow in the presence of even higher concentrations of ksm, as reported for other bacteria  <cit> .

when monolayers were infected with  <dig> to  <dig> pfu in the presence of ksm at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  resistant plaques appeared at a frequency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for c. psittaci 6bc while no plaques were seen for c. trachomatis under the same conditions . we have previously observed this difference in behavior between the two chlamydial strains for acquisition of resistance towards other ribosome targeting antibiotics  <cit> . because expression of resistance requires that more than 50% of the ribosome population be of the resistant phenotype, c. trachomatis with two rrna operons is at a disadvantage compared to c. psittaci 6bc which harbors only one rrna operon. ksm started to affect c. trachomatis l <dig> growth at  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  but a concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was completely inhibitory when cells were infected with a few hundred pfus. therefore we reasoned that serial passage in subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic would allow the enrichment of putative low level ksmr bacteria, as previously seen for azithromycin  <cit> . three independent cultures of c. trachomatis l <dig> were passaged up to  <dig> times in ksm ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  three individual clones were then selected and purified in the plaque assay using  <dig> μg ksm ml- <dig> 

4-molecular and phenotypic characterizations of ksm resistance mutations in c. psittaci 6bc and c. trachomatis l2
sixteen independent spontaneous ksmr plaques were isolated for c. psittaci 6bc, expanded twice in the presence of  <dig> μg ksm ml- <dig> and further analyzed. dna sequence analysis showed that none carried a mutation in ksga. however, sequencing of the unique 16s rrna gene revealed an a to g mutation at position  <dig> which is known as one of the binding sites for ksm  <cit> . similarly, three c. trachomatis l <dig> isolates that arose in the presence of  <dig> μg ksm ml- <dig> were further expanded in the presence of the drug and analyzed. none carried a mutation in the drug binding sites as expected from the presence of two rrna operons in the strain  <cit> . none carried a mutation in rpsi encoding the 30s ribosomal subunit s <dig> protein that is a target for ksm resistance  <cit> . sequencing of the ksgal <dig> dna region revealed the insertion of a tg nucleotide doublet in the last third of the gene. this doublet base-pair insertion, likely the result of a replication slippage  <cit> , creates an early in-frame stop codon in the ksga coding sequence, resulting in the expression of a ksga variant of  <dig> residues instead of  <dig> .

stability of the acquired phenotype was then tested on one representative mutant of both classes  by growth in the absence of selective pressure . plaques formed by the c. psittaci 6bc bck <dig> and the c. trachomatis l <dig> ksgae <dig> variants grown for a minimum of  <dig> days in the absence of selection displayed the same number of infectious particles when titered in the presence or absence of  <dig> and  <dig> μg ksm ml- <dig>  respectively, indicating that the resistance phenotype was stable . growth of c. psittaci bck <dig> was not affected by  <dig> mg ksm ml- <dig>  the highest concentration of ksm that was not toxic to the mouse fibroblast cells. on the other hand, plaques formed by c. trachomatis ksgae <dig> were already smaller in the presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> ksm, while  <dig> mg ml- <dig> of the drug inhibited at least  <dig> ksgae <dig> pfus  . the moderate level  of ksm resistance conferred by mutations in ksga likely precluded c. psittaci 6bc ksga mutants from being selected directly in the plaque assay  <cit> .

high level ksm resistance associated with mutations in the drug binding sites has only been observed previously in engineered strains of e. coli  <cit>  and b. subtillis  <cit>  in which each of the seven or ten rrna operons, respectively, were inactivated, and the strains expressed only one rrna operon encoded on a plasmid. although both studies still reported that ksga mutations are the main mechanism of resistance to ksm, mutations in the drug-binding site at position a <dig> and g <dig> of the 16s rrna conferred four to eight times more resistance to ksm than ksga inactivation or alteration of the adenosine targeted by the methylase at position  <dig> of the 16s rrna. in this study, all ksmr mutations selected in c. psittaci 6bc mapped to the drug-binding site at position a794g. our inability to isolate ksmr plaques for c. psittaci 6bc with mutations in the 16s rrna gene at position  <dig> or  <dig> suggests that either they do not confer ksm resistance levels high enough to be selected in the plaque assay or they impose a significant burden on bacterial fitness. such species-specific bias for drug resistance mutations has been reported for other ribosome-targeting antibiotics including tetracycline, linezolid and macrolides  <cit> .

5-ksga is critical for optimal growth of chlamydia
serial passages in sub-inhibitory concentrations of ksm allowed the purification of a c. trachomatis variant synthesizing a shortened rrna adenine dimethyltransferase enzyme in which the eight structural and catalytic methyltransferase motifs were maintained, but harboring  <dig> unrelated amino acids because of the frameshift at codon  <dig> . overexpression of the truncated chlamydial protein in atm <dig>  the e. coli ksga mutant, was strongly inhibitory for cell growth, as observed earlier with the wild-type ksgal <dig> protein. on the other hand expression from a copy of ksgae <dig>  the frameshift mutant, integrated in the bacterial chromosome, i.e. in atm <dig>  had no consequence on bacterial growth in the absence or in the presence of ksm , with a mic of  <dig> μg.ml- <dig> . this shows that the chlamydial ksga c-terminal tail is essential for activity in this heterologous system. crystal structure analyses revealed that the n-terminal and the c-terminal portions of e. coli and thermus thermophilus ksga orthologs form two domains and the presence of several positively charged residues in the c-terminal domain predicted its involvement in binding to rrna  <cit> . recent evidence has shown that both domains interact with 16s rrna in 30s ribosomal subunits  <cit> . more specifically the c-terminal domain of ksga competes with the c-terminal domain of initiation factor if <dig> for binding with the central domain of 16s rrna. accordingly, ksga would prevent ribosomes that are undergoing methylation from entering the translational cycle  <cit> . as a result one might expect immature ribosomes to enter translation in cells that lack ksga thus bearing a physiological cost.

screening for ksm resistance in c. trachomatis allowed us to select for ksga mutations in these as yet genetically intractable pathogens  <cit> . interestingly, plaques formed by the c. trachomatis l <dig> ksgae <dig> variant in the absence of antibiotic were smaller than the wild-type strain  with sizes of  <dig>  mm ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm ±  <dig> , respectively. this result shows that alteration in ksga affects the fitness of c. trachomatis in vitro, similarly to mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . it is worth noting that although inactivation of ksga has a minimal effect on growth of e. coli or b. subtilis at 37°c, recent studies have shown that the mutants are outcompeted by the wild-type strains at 37°c  <cit> . similarly, while growth of a y. pseudotuberculosis ksga mutant is not severely affected under normal laboratory conditions, the mutant strain is attenuated in the mouse model indicating that dimethylation is essential for optimal fitness of the pathogen in vivo  <cit> . although, the lack of a small animal model for c. trachomatis l <dig> precludes us from testing the consequences of ksga inactivation on the pathogenicity of the strain, it is tempting to assume that the impairment of c. trachomatis l <dig> growth in vitro seen for our ksga mutant would be reflected by an attenuation in virulence in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
when high throughput screening of compounds predicted to bind to bacillus subtillis rna methyltransferase ermc identified new compounds that were inhibitory to the growth of c. pneumoniae in vitro, alvesalo et al. proposed that these small compounds were targeting the bacterial ksga homolog  <cit> . considering that ribosome biogenesis factors are emerging as potential therapeutic targets to combat pathogens  <cit> , the present work provides evidence that chlamydia possess a functional rrna dimethylase enzyme that is important for optimal growth of these obligate intracellular organisms. the demonstration of two methyltransferases in chlamydia  raises the question of how these obligate intracellular bacteria obtain s-adenosyl-methionine to carry out these modifications. our laboratory is currently investigating this aspect of chlamydia biology.
