BACKGROUND
peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes or murein hydrolases have the ability to digest bacterial cell walls. such enzymes from bacteriophages represent a unique class of antibacterial agents because of their ability to cleave bacterial peptidoglycan in a species-specific or genus-specific manner. thus, they provide a means to selectively target pathogens  <cit> .

at the end of the bacteriophage infection process, progeny are released from the host cell by lysis, which is mediated by two phage-encoded gene products, endolysins and holins  <cit> . holins are transmembrane proteins that create lesions in the cytoplasmic membrane through which peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes  gain access to the peptidoglycan layer  <cit> . bacteriophages encode another peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme involved in the initial stages of infection that facilitates phage dna injection into the host cell. these proteins, which are distinct from endolysins, aid in the rapid lysis of host cells by a phenomenon referred to as "lysis from without" upon infection with high multiplicities of phage  <cit> . enzymes involved in dna injection are an integral component of the virion structure of many phages  <cit> .

examples of these phage structure-associated peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes include gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig> , gp <dig> , orf <dig> , protein  <dig> , and gp <dig>   <cit> .

s. aureus is an important human pathogen responsible for a wide variety of diseases and is a common cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. the emergence of antibiotic-resistant s. aureus strains underscores the need to develop alternate novel therapies  <cit> . in this context, we evaluated phage k, a known polyvalent phage with a broad host range that includes coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci  <cit> .

we report here the identification of the phage tail-associated muralytic enzyme  of phage k   <cit>  and generation of a chimeric protein that combines the lethal activity of tame with the sh3b staphylococcal cell wall-binding domain of lysostaphin  <cit> . we demonstrated the efficacy of this chimeric protein in vivo using a rat nasal colonization model. some of these findings were presented at the  <dig> madison molecular genetics of bacteria and bacteriophage meeting at the university of wisconsin  <cit> .

methods
bacterial strains, bacteriophages, plasmids, and growth conditions
all bacterial strains used in this study are listed in two tables . cell culture media were obtained from himedia labs . phage k was obtained from the national collection of type culture  and propagated on s. aureus rn <dig>  <cit> . the methicillin-resistant s. aureus  strain b <dig> was used for bactericidal activity assays, and rn <dig> was used for zymograms.plasmid pet21a  was used for cloning and the constructs were expressed under the control of a t <dig> promoter. plasmid prg <dig>  carrying full-length lysostaphin was used as a template for amplifying the sh3b domain. all cultures were grown in luria bertani  broth at 37°c,  <dig> rpm. ampicillin  or isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside  were added to the cultures as needed. all reagents used in this study were purchased from sigma  unless otherwise stated.

sequence analysis and identification of tame
the dna sequence of phage k was obtained from the national center for biotechnology information    <cit> . database searches were performed using blastn and blastp  <cit> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. domain identification and protein family allocation was performed with the pfam database  <cit> http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ and the conserved domain architecture retrieval tool  <cit> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/lexington/lexington.cgi using the default parameters.

cloning of orf <dig> and its truncated forms
phage k dna was prepared as previously described  <cit> . all dna manipulations were performed according to the methods of sambrook and russell  <cit> . briefly, the full-length orf <dig> gene was amplified from phage k dna by polymerase chain reaction  using a forward primer containing a unique ndei site: 5'-ccggaattccatatgcgtagaataagacctaag-3' and a reverse primer incorporating an xhoi site: 5'-ccgccgctcgagttatttcttatcgtaaatgaattgtgc-3'. amplification was carried out using a smart cycler . the 2427-bp pcr product was gel-purified  and then digested with ndei and xhoi. after gel purification, the dna sequence was ligated into the pet21a vector. escherichia coli dh5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixture, and transformants were selected on lb plates containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin. plasmids  were isolated from the transformants, screened by ndei/xhoi digestion, and sequenced. the plasmid containing the full-length orf <dig> was designated as pgmb <dig>  truncated forms of orf <dig> were generated by pcr amplification using sets of primers for specific regions and cloned into the pet21a vector. clone integrity was verified by restriction analysis and dna sequencing.

construction of chimera p128
the dna fragment encoding lys <dig>  excluding the stop codon, was pcr-amplified incorporating an ndei site in the forward primer and xhoi site in the reverse primer. the fragment was cloned into the pet21a vector to generate pgdc <dig>  the sh3b binding domain of lysostaphin was pcr-amplified from the plasmid prg <dig> with xhoi restriction sites in both primers: forward primer 5'-ccgccgctcgagacgccgaatacaggttggaaaacaaac-3' and reverse primer 5'-ccgccgctcgagtcactttatagttccccaaagaac-3'. the 300-bp pcr product was then cloned into pgdc <dig> to generate pgdc <dig>  transcription of the chimeric gene lys16-sh3b in pgdc <dig> was driven by the t <dig> promoter.

protein expression and purification
the highly inducible t <dig> expression system of e. coli was used for hyperexpression of the target proteins. e. coli er <dig>  harboring the different constructs was grown in lb at 37°c until absorbance at  <dig> nm  reached  <dig> , as determined by spectrophotometry . protein expression was induced by incubation with  <dig> mm iptg at 37°c for  <dig> h. cells were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min, resuspended in  <dig> mm tris-hcl , and disrupted by ultrasonication. the cell lysate soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min, and protein expression was analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . a crude soluble fraction containing the protein of interest was used for zymogram analysis and the bactericidal activity assay. after ammonium sulphate precipitation, soluble p <dig> was purified by two-step ion-exchange chromatography.

zymogram
denaturing sds-page  and zymograms were performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, muralytic activity was detected by separating protein samples by 12% sds-page on gels containing  <dig> % of autoclaved s. aureus rn <dig> cells. after electrophoresis, the zymograms were washed for  <dig> min with distilled water at room temperature, transferred to a buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl  and  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c for in situ protein renaturation. the zymograms were rinsed with distilled water, stained with  <dig> % methylene blue and  <dig> % koh for  <dig> h at room temperature, and then destained with distilled water. peptidoglycan hydrolase activity was detected as a clear zone against the dark blue background of methylene blue.

electron microscopy
phage k particles were purified by cscl density-gradient ultracentrifugation. immunoelectron microscopy was performed by incubating approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> phage particles with lys <dig> antibodies conjugated to 10-nm gold particles  at room temperature overnight. the 1-ml samples were briefly centrifuged at  <dig> × g, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min. the resulting pellet was resuspended in  <dig> mm tris-hcl . a 20-μl aliquot of this sample was loaded onto formvar-coated grids  and dried. the grids were stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid and observed by transmission electron microscopy .

bactericidal activity assay
bactericidal activity was assessed by measuring reduction in viable cells  after addition of p <dig> protein. the method is a modified version of the national committee on clinical laboratory standards assay used for determination of minimum bactericidal concentration  <cit> . briefly, the mrsa clinical isolate b <dig> was grown in lb broth until a <dig> reached  <dig> , and then an aliquot was diluted in lb broth to obtain  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. aliquots  were transferred to  <dig> -ml microfuge tubes, treated with  <dig> μl crude or purified protein, and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm. unless otherwise indicated, bactericidal activity was always performed using  <dig> μg/ml of p <dig>  residual viable cells were enumerated as colony-forming units  by serial dilution and plating on lb agar plates.

turbidity reduction assay
exponentially growing cells were harvested and resuspended in  <dig> mm tris-hcl . for gram-negative cultures, cells were pelleted, resuspended in chcl3-saturated  <dig> mm tris-hcl , incubated for  <dig> min to expose the peptidoglycan layer, and then centrifuged at  <dig> × g. the resulting pellet was resuspended in  <dig> mm tris-hcl , and the concentration was adjusted to about a <dig> of  <dig>  for use as substrate for the assay. purified p <dig>  was added, and a <dig> was determined at different time points .

in vivo efficacy of p <dig> in a rat nasal colonization model
animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal ethics committee and the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals . gangagen is registered with cpcsea . healthy female wistar rats  were used in all experiments.

evaluation of commensal nasal flora
the commensal nasal flora of the rats was evaluated by nasal swabbing. rat nares were swabbed by gentle insertion and withdrawal of a sterile microbrush×, which was moistened with sterile  <dig> % nacl. the swab portions of the microbrush were cut and then completely immersed in  <dig> % nacl  in microfuge tubes. tubes were thoroughly vortexed, and the supernatant was diluted as needed and plated on agar containing 5% sheep blood. staphylococcus colonies were identified based on morphology, biochemical tests and also analyzed using the histaph™ identification kit . an s. aureus-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  was used for confirmation.

experimental colonization of rat nares and evaluation of p <dig> efficacy
mrsa usa <dig> was grown overnight on nutrient agar containing 5% sheep blood. colonies were harvested by flooding the plate with sterile  <dig> % nacl. cells were pelleted by centrifugation  and resuspended in sterile  <dig> % nacl  for nasal instillation.

rats were grouped and anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine  and xylazine . a 10-μl aliquot of s. aureus cell suspension was instilled into the nares of all animals on day  <dig>  after  <dig> h, twice daily intranasal treatments to anaesthetized rats were initiated according to treatment group: p <dig> formulated as a hydrogel , placebo gel that contained phosphate buffered saline in place of the protein, or bactroban nasal . on day  <dig>  the rats were euthanized by anesthetic overdose. the nasal tissue  was removed and processed for quantitative evaluation of colonization as described previously  <cit> . aliquots of the supernatant  were plated on nutrient agar containing 5% sheep blood and incubated overnight at 37°c. the s. aureus usa <dig> colonies were enumerated by tentative identification of hemolytic phenotype. representative colonies from each usa300-positive animal were then purified on lb agar for biochemical characterization and confirmation by elisa.

confirmation of s. aureus by elisa
purified colonies were suspended in  <dig>  m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer  to a cell density of about  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. a 200-μl aliquot of this cell suspension was used to coat 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 4°c. the wells were washed with tris buffered saline with  <dig> % tween <dig>  and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin  in tbst for  <dig> h at 37°c. after repeated washes with tbst, rabbit polyclonal anti-rn <dig> antiserum  was added, and plates were incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. the wells were washed again with tbst before adding alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody . plates were incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. after washing the wells, the substrate p-nitro phenyl phosphate  was added, the plates were incubated for  <dig> min, and absorbance at  <dig> nm was determined.

RESULTS
identification of tame of phage k
our bioinformatics analysis indicated that phagek harbors two genes involved in host cell wall lysis. in addition to the endolysin gene in the lysis cassette encoded by open reading frames  30/ <dig>  <cit> , we found another gene  encoding a muralytic enzyme near the genes encoding structural tail proteins . orf <dig> codes for a  <dig> -kda protein of  <dig> amino acids that possesses a c-terminal peptidoglycan-degrading domain . we assigned this domain to the cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase  family through bioinformatic analysis  based on the reported characteristics of this domain  <cit> .

blastp  <cit>  searches revealed that orf <dig> is related to the tail lysin protein orf <dig> of staphylococcus phage g <dig> and orf <dig> of staphylococcus phage twort. a significant similarity was also found with gp <dig> of listeria phage a <dig> , gp <dig> of listeria phage p <dig> , putative tail lysin of enterococcus phage phief24c , and putative tail lysin of lactobacillus phage lb338- <dig> .

protein expression and activity of orf <dig> and its n-terminal truncated forms
chap domain-containing proteins have been reported to be lytic to staphylococci  <cit> . incubating  <dig> μl crude preparation of orf <dig> with  <dig> ×  <dig> cells of mrsa clinical isolate b <dig> for  <dig> min reduced cfus by 90% compared with the control, demonstrating its bactericidal activity against s. aureus .

to determine the function of orf <dig>  we cloned and expressed the full-length  orf <dig> gene. this yielded a 91-kda protein as well as lower molecular-weight proteins, all of which showed muralytic activity on zymograms. this observation led us to generate truncated forms of orf <dig>  , all of which showed muralytic activity on zymograms and bactericidal activity against live staphylococcus cells, except for the 13-kda form, which was active only on zymograms . the truncated 16-kda orf <dig>  designated as lys <dig> , which showed cell wall-degrading activity on zymogram  and lethal activity in s. aureus cultures , was chosen for further characterization and development.

confirmation of orf <dig> as tame
immunogold electron microscopy was used to confirm that orf <dig> is a part of the phage structure. we purified phage k by cscl density gradient centrifugation and incubated phage particles with immunogold-labeled antibodies directed against lys <dig>  the gold-conjugated lys <dig> antibody bound to the phage tail structure. this binding was confirmed to be specific .

antistaphylococcal chimeric protein p128
we combined the muralytic protein lys <dig> with sh3b  <cit> , the staphylococcal cell wall-binding domain of lysostaphin, to generate the chimeric protein p <dig> . the cloned sequence was verified, and the chimeric construct yielded a protein of about  <dig> kda. the soluble form of p <dig> was produced in e. coli and purified . this protein showed muralytic activity on a zymogram with s. aureus cells .

the bactericidal activity of lys <dig> and p <dig> was compared by treating cells with varying concentrations of the protein and enumerating residual cfus. p <dig> demonstrated superior antistaphylococcal activity compared with lys <dig>  at  <dig> ng/ml, p <dig> reduced viable cell numbers by three orders of magnitude. lys <dig> did not achieve comparable activity, even at 100-fold higher concentration .

specificity of p <dig> and dose-dependent activity
purified p <dig>  was tested then for activity against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, sterptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus carnosus, staphylococcus aureus col, and staphylococcus aureus usa <dig>  p <dig> was specific to staphylococcus strains and caused significant reduction in the turbidity of the cultures, measured by optical density at  <dig> nm . the cultures lysed within  <dig> minutes of addition of the protein. in contrast, the gram-negative cultures tested were not affected by p <dig> .

the bactericidal activity of p <dig> against staphylococcus strains was dose-dependent.

the minimum concentration of p <dig> required achieve >  <dig> % killing was determined by a bactericidal activity assay with the mrsa col strain. we found that concentrations ≥  <dig>  μg/ml killed >  <dig> % of the cells .

activity against global panel of s. aureus strains
to further characterize p <dig>  its antimicrobial activity was tested on a panel of typed s. aureus strains, representing more than  <dig> isolates worldwide. this panel included several mrsa strains and the clinically significant strains usa <dig>  usa <dig>  and usa <dig> . p <dig> reduced the cell numbers of these strains by 99% to  <dig> %, demonstrating its efficacy against isolates of clinical significance .

experimental colonization of rat nares
before initiating mrsa colonization, we evaluated the commensal bacterial flora of the rat nares in several experiments. in these wistar rats, we found staphylococcus strains including s. sciuri subsp. rodentium, s. chromogenes, and s. equorum; however, s. aureus was not detected . multiple experiments were performed using a total of  <dig> rats to establish the rate and the degree of colonization of mrsa usa <dig> on day  <dig> after instillation. overall,  <dig> of  <dig> animals  were colonized, and the median cfu recovered from the colonized animals was  <dig> ×  <dig> .

evaluation of p <dig> efficacy in vivo
at the time of treatment, one death had occurred in each of the placebo and p <dig> treatment groups. in the remaining rats, p <dig> hydrogel was found to completely decolonize four of nine  animals . median cfu numbers recovered in the p <dig> hydrogel-treated group was two orders of magnitude lower than those of the other groups. all animals in the colonization control group and the groups treated with placebo or mupirocin remained colonized, as demonstrated by the large number of recoverable bacteria . to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of efficacy against mupirocin-resistant community-associated mrsa usa <dig> in a nasal colonization model.

discussion
there has been considerable interest in phage endolysins as potential therapeutic targets. these cell wall-degrading enzymes play a role in releasing phage progeny at the end of the phage replication cycle. however, in this study we focused on enzymes capable of similar cell wall-degrading activity. these proteins are present as part of phage structure and are involved in the initial phase of phage infection. phage tail-like bacteriocins produced by many pseudomonas strains  <cit>  kill other pseudomonas strains by adsorbing to them and causing a fatal lesion in the cell envelope  <cit> . both bacteriophages and phage-tail-like bacteriocins exert their lethal activity using a structural component. structurally associated muralytic enzymes of phages have been identified at the base of the tail , within the phage head , in the internal membrane of the capsid , or in the nucleocapsid . the localization of the enzyme is associated with the distinct mode of cell entry used by each phage. considering that tames are part of the infection apparatus, they have a direct role in the specificity of phage-host interaction. these proteins are constantly exposed to environments encountered by the phage, suggesting that they are inherently stable. phage tames would therefore be generally well suited for antibacterial therapy. the focus of our study is such a structural protein, phage k tame, which possesses bactericidal properties.

in this study, we identified a gene  within the structural module of the staphylococcal phage k genome that codes for a muralytic protein. we also carried out functional analysis of the gene product, which we designated as a tame. the orf <dig> sequence is located in the tail gene cluster of the phage genome and shows significant sequence similarity with putative tail lysins of other phages of gram-positive bacteria. the catalytic region that confers bactericidal activity to orf <dig> is localized to the c-terminal chap domain. we generated truncated versions of orf <dig> by pcr- amplifying specific lengths of orf <dig> gene followed by cloning and expression. zymogram analysis showed that the truncated forms of orf <dig> were active against s. aureus peptidoglycan. through this analysis, we identified the 16-kda c-terminal region as the minimum portion of orf <dig> required for bactericidal activity. this 16-kda protein  containing the chap domain was purified and found to be stable. adding  <dig> μg/ml purified lys <dig> to mrsa clinical isolates reduced cell numbers by  <dig> %, demonstrating its antibacterial property .

using antibodies against lys  <dig>  we were able to localize the protein on the phage tail structure. chap domains are present in a wide variety of proteins, including phage endolysins, bacterial autolysins, and various eukaryotic proteins. most proteins that contain a chap domain function are peptidoglycan hydrolases and are associated with amidases  <cit> . no other known domains were identified in orf <dig>  like the tail-associated lysin tal <dig>  orf <dig> undergoes autoproteolysis upon hyperexpression in an e. coli host  <cit> .

phage-encoded lytic enzymes typically have a modular organization consisting of a catalytic domain that degrades the peptidoglycan and a binding domain that recognizes the cell wall of the target bacterium  <cit> . however, no cell wall-binding domain could be identified in orf <dig>  ncbi blast  <cit>  and pfam  <cit>  databases were used to compare cell wall targeting/binding domains of various staphylococcus spp and their phages to select a suitable domain that could be fused to lys <dig> 

our objective was to generate a chimeric protein with high specificity of target recognition and potent antistaphylococcal activity. to this end, we combined the muralytic activity of lys <dig> with the known specific bacterial cell wall-binding sh3b domain from lysostaphin  <cit> . the chimeric protein p <dig> displayed higher activity than lys <dig> and was found to be potent against s. aureus .

p <dig> was effective on a panel of mrsa and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus clinical isolates representing more than  <dig>  isolates . in addition, we demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of p <dig> in a rat s. aureus nasal colonization model . we chose this model because growing evidence points to nasal carriage as the source of s. aureus infections in various clinical and community settings  <cit> . although topical mupirocin is effective in clearing nasal s. aureus and reducing the incidence of infection, mupirocin resistance is limiting its preventative and therapeutic use  <cit> . in our study, we used usa <dig>  which is a community-acquired mupirocin-resistant mrsa strain of high clinical significance  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report of usa <dig> use in a nasal colonization model. p <dig> applied to rat nares in the form of an aqueous gel either decolonized the nares of usa <dig> completely or significantly reduced cell numbers. thus, p <dig> is a novel chimeric protein with potent antistaphylococcal activity and warrants further development for therapeutic use.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the development of a novel chimeric antistaphylococcal protein derived from phage k. the phage k gene, designated orf <dig> and encoding a tame, was identified within the morphogenetic module of the phage genome. the 91-kda gene product  contained a sequence corresponding to the chap domain at the c-terminus. we cloned and expressed several n-terminal truncated forms of the orf <dig> gene to arrive at the smallest portion of the protein essential for antistaphylococcal activity. this 16-kda protein  was fused with an efficient staphylococcal cell-wall targeting domain  derived from the bacterial protein lysostaphin to create the chimeric protein p <dig> 

p <dig> shows specific activity against staphylococci and lethal effects against s. aureus isolates of clinical significance and global representation. we tested the protein in an experimental nasal colonization model using mrsa usa <dig> and found it effective in decolonizing s. aureus in rat nares. taken together, our findings show that p <dig> is a promising therapeutic protein candidate against antibiotic-resistant staphylococci.
