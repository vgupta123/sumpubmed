BACKGROUND
eimeria tenella is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite of the phylum apicomplexa and one of the main causes of avian coccidiosis. diarrhoea, anaemia and mortality are the main manifestations of clinical coccidiosis but in sub-clinical infections, ineffective feed conversion due to malabsorption is the most important consequence. coccidiosis is estimated to cost poultry industries around the world in excess of us $ <dig> billion per year  <cit> . with the development of drug resistance in eimeria species threatening the continued use of prophylactic anticoccidials, vaccination remains a desirable long-term strategy for combatting this disease  <cit> .

the lifecycle of e. tenella is, arguably, the least complex of all coccidia and serves as a model to understand the lifecycles of many other important parasites in this group. toxoplasma gondii, for instance, has a particularly complex lifecycle and is able to infect a variety of intermediate hosts but reproduces sexually only in felids . in e. tenella, following ingestion of a sporulated oocyst, released sporozoites migrate to the intestinal epithelia and undergo three rounds of asexual reproduction, producing successive generations of merozoites. third-generation merozoites then differentiate into sexual stages . each microgametocyte produces approximately  <dig> motile microgametes, each capable of fertilising a single macrogamete. the ensuing zygote encapsulates itself in a protective wall, becoming an oocyst, and is excreted in the faeces of the definitive host to sporulate in the external environment.

the development of the resilient oocyst wall is a crucial feature of the coccidia and provides remarkable protection, facilitating its essential transmission between hosts. moreover, disrupting its formation is the basis for the only subunit vaccine against any apicomplexan disease to reach the marketplace, underscoring the potential for controlling parasitic disease by blocking transmission  <cit> . however, the development of additional transmission blocking strategies is hampered by our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern gametocyte and oocyst development.

the differentiation and development of distinct biological stages in the apicomplexa are dependent on regulated gene transcription. accordingly, profiling quantitative changes in gene transcription has proven a useful strategy for identifying important stage-specific genes in asexual stages of e. tenella  <cit>  and t. gondii  <cit> , as well as in gametocyte stages of plasmodium  <cit> . to date, a global analysis of gene transcription has yet to be performed for coccidian gametocytes due, in part, to difficulties producing sufficient quantities of parasite material for conventional transcriptional analysis. however, recent advances in both the sensitivity and affordability of next-generation transcription profiling techniques  have opened the door for a thorough analysis of the e. tenella gametocyte transcriptome.

described in the present study are results from an rna seq analysis of e. tenella gametocytes compared with two asexual stages - sporozoites and merozoites. many of the upregulated gametocyte transcripts identified encode proteins with known or potential roles in parasite transmission. two oocyst wall proteins, a subtilisin-like protease and an amine oxidase, all specific to macrogametocytes, are characterised in further biological detail, along with a microgametocyte gamete fusion protein, underscoring their potential as transmission blocking targets.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing of e. tenella gametocytes, merozoites and sporozoites
the dimorphic gametocyte stages of eimeria carry out specific biological roles, including fertilisation and oocyst wall assembly, which are required for the formation of an infective  oocyst and transmission between hosts. in an effort to better characterise these enigmatic stages, transcriptome sequencing was carried out on e. tenella gametocytes, comprising a mixture of both macrogametocytes  and microgametocytes  . in parallel, the transcriptomes of two different asexual parasite stages, namely third-generation merozoites  and sporozoites , were also sequenced to allow the identification of upregulated transcripts in gametocytes.

total rna was extracted from triplicate biological replicates representing each developmental stage, dnase-treated and quality assessed by automated gel electrophoresis . parasite-specific large ribosomal rna bands  were detected in all samples, although trace amounts of contaminating host rna  were observed in gametocyte samples, an unavoidable feature attributed to the methods used to enrich these stages from infected chickens ; this was not a strong concern since we performed read mapping to the e. tenella genome scaffold and not de novo assembly. paired-end sequencing was carried out on all rna samples using the illumina hiseq platform. over  <dig> million paired-end reads were produced per sample with the exception of one merozoite replicate, mb, which failed outright and was excluded from further analyses .

paired-end reads were mapped to all  <dig>  exon models  predicted in the e. tenella genome scaffold . the proportion of reads uniquely mapping to e. tenella exon models was lower in gametocyte rna seq libraries than in merozoites or sporozoites and can be explained by the higher proportion of contaminating host rna in the gametocyte samples . nevertheless, the extraordinary depth of sequencing achieved through illumina hiseq - including a total of  <dig>  million paired-end reads mapped uniquely to e. tenella exon models across the three gametocyte libraries – provided a solid foundation for quantitative assessment of gene transcript levels. a table listing the total number of paired reads mapped to each of the  <dig>  predicted exon models in each of the nine rna seq libraries is provided .

identification of upregulated gametocyte transcripts through analysis of differential expression
the transcription of genes encoding proteins with important roles in e. tenella gametocyte biology, including oocyst wall biosynthesis  <cit> , protein glycosylation  <cit>  and proteolytic cleavage of oocyst wall proteins  <cit> , is typically restricted to gametocytes and zygotes . in order to identify other upregulated gametocyte transcripts, rna seq mapping was used to generate quantitative differential expression  profiles of individual genes between developmental stages of e. tenella.

however, prior to this de analysis, the global transcription profiles of each of the eight rna seq libraries were compared in a pair-wise manner using hierarchical clustering . heat-mapping of the pearson correlation coefficient scores, confirmed that transcription profiles were most similar between replicates of the same biological stage . the secondary clustering of gametocyte and merozoite replicates is unsurprising given that third-generation merozoites differentiate into gametocytes. furthermore, this secondary clustering is also caused by the presence of contaminating merozoite stages co-purified in gametocyte samples, an unavoidable bi-product of the asynchronicity of e. tenella infections at this later time point .figure  <dig> 
identification of upregulated gametocyte transcripts using differential expression analysis.  the eight rna seq libraries were subjected to pair-wise hierarchical clustering between the vectors of read counts for all pairs of samples. heat-mapping of pearson’s correlation coefficient scores reveal similarities between the transcriptome profiles of the different samples, with white  being the most similar and red  being the least similar. adjacent dendograms reveal clustering of the biological replicates within the same developmental stages, including gametocytes , merozoites  and sporozoites .  normalised read counts of individual genes calculated for gametocytes have been plotted against those for merozoites  and sporozoites . gene transcripts calculated to be upregulated in gametocytes compared with merozoites or sporozoites reside between dotted red or green dotted-lines, respectively. the dotted blue lines indicate equal levels of transcript abundance between samples. for the sake of clarity, the axis limits have been set to a maximum normalised count of  <dig> , inevitably excluding some highly expressed gene transcripts.  summary of the de analysis of gametocytes compared with merozoites  or sporozoites  showing the percentage of genes upregulated  or downregulated  in gametocytes, of all predicted e. tenella genes.  venn diagram revealing the overlap of genes whose transcript levels were upregulated in gametocytes compared with either merozoites  or sporozoites . a total of  <dig> upregulated gametocyte transcripts genes were identified in this overlapping region.



next, normalised read counts were generated for each of the three different biological stages using the deseq algorithm  <cit> , thereby allowing a comparison of gene transcript levels between different samples. a table listing the normalised counts calculated for each gene in the three biological stages is provided . a plot of normalised counts for individual gene transcripts in gametocytes against those in merozoites  or sporozoites  gives an overview of global de of gene transcription. accordingly, genes transcribed specifically in gametocytes plot along or near the x-axis, or along the y-axis for either merozoites or sporozoites, while genes showing no de plot along the dotted blue line . these pairwise comparisons demonstrate that the transcripts of a large population of genes are detected specifically in gametocytes, mirroring the distinct processes utilised in these sexual stages.

for the purposes of defining stage-specific expression, genes were defined as de if the log <dig> fold-change calculated from normalised counts between two stages was equal to or greater than three . the population of upregulated gametocyte transcripts identified using this threshold has been highlighted in the pairwise comparisons with merozoites and sporozoites . the log <dig> fold-changes calculated for all genes in deseq pairwise comparisons between  gametocytes and merozoites or  gametocytes and sporozoites are provided  along with an adjusted p-value representing false discovery rates. excluding genes with de false discovery rates of > <dig> ,  <dig>  gene transcripts  are upregulated in gametocytes compared to merozoites and  <dig>   in gametocytes compared to sporozoites . in contrast, fewer genes were calculated with higher transcript levels in merozoites  or sporozoites  compared to gametocytes. the identification of  <dig> merozoite-specific genes is almost certainly a gross underestimate since the co-purification of merozoites in the gametocyte sample  clearly limits the identification of genes with elevated transcript levels in merozoites. however, in the scope of our study, the identification of genes with elevated transcript levels in gametocytes is highly stringent. in total,  <dig> upregulated gametocyte transcripts were identified , representing  <dig> % of all predicted e. tenella genes. the gene identification, putative biological function and transcript abundance  for each of these genes, in each developmental stage, are provided .

highly abundant upregulated gametocyte transcripts
within the subset of  <dig> upregulated gametocyte transcripts identified in e. tenella, the level of transcript abundance for each gene in gametocytes, expressed as fpkm  varies by many orders of magnitude from  <dig> . <dig>  down to  <dig>   . a majority  of all  <dig> upregulated gametocyte transcripts code for hypothetical proteins , an unsurprising observation given the limited understanding of coccidian sexual biology. however, genes coding for proteins with putative roles in glycosylation, protease activity, redox activity and fatty acid metabolism and as components of microgametes, surface and the oocyst wall, are highlighted in figure  <dig> and are described in further detail below. other putative functions highlighted but not discussed in detail include:  cytoskeleton/transport, processes which may overlap with microgamete flagellar functions; and  dna/rna binding, which may have unspecified roles in gametocyte-specific gene regulation. the miscellaneous category includes proteins with diverse functions, such as kinase activity, calcium binding, metabolism, etc., whose roles in coccidian gametocyte biology remain unclear and require detailed further study before any meaningful discussion of their functional significance can be attempted.figure  <dig> 
biological functions of proteins coded by upregulated gametocyte transcripts. the biological function of proteins coded by each of the  <dig> upregulated gametocyte transcripts was assigned manually based on toxodb, blast2go or annotations published previously . the pie chart represents the proportion of upregulated gametocyte transcripts characterised by these different biological functions.



the two genes with the highest transcript abundance in gametocytes, eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig>  are tandemly located in the e. tenella genome  and code for proteins that share almost 100% sequence identity  . both proteins contain a predicted signal peptide and either four  or five  transmembrane domains. the third and fourth most abundant upregulated gametocyte transcripts, eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig>  code for proteins with predicted signal peptides and 100% sequence identity over the first  <dig> amino acids of the n-terminal . efforts to characterise the function of these four proteins is on-going.

as expected, genes coding for previously characterised gametocyte antigens and oocyst wall proteins, including etgam <dig>  etgam <dig>  etgam <dig> and etgam <dig>  are among the most highly transcribed gametocyte genes; these are described in greater detail further on. another highly transcribed gametocyte gene is eth_ <dig>  which codes for a macrophage migration inhibitory factor, etmif, originally described in e. tenella merozoites  <cit> . interestingly, this protein has been subsequently localised to wall-forming bodies of macrogametes and appears to play a role in modulating the host immune system  <cit> .

highly abundant transcripts code for novel macrogamete-specific oocyst wall proteins
oocyst wall and surface proteins are attractive transmission blocking targets  <cit> . coxabic®, the only commercially-available subunit vaccine against any apicomplexan, comprises macrogamete-specific proteins, gam <dig> and gam <dig>  both of which are destined for incorporation into the oocyst wall  <cit> . gene transcripts coding for etgam <dig> and other oocyst wall proteins  are confirmed here to be upregulated in gametocytes . the fifth most abundant upregulated gametocyte transcript detected here, etgam <dig>  is a multi-copy gene that codes for a histidine- and proline-rich protein  <cit> , while etgam <dig> and etgam <dig> code for tyrosine-rich proteins  <cit> . like gam <dig> and gam <dig>  etgam <dig> is a component of the wall forming bodies of macrogametes and is incorporated into the developing oocyst wall  <cit> . eth_ <dig> codes for a protein that shows homology to the cysteine-rich oocyst wall proteins, tgowp <dig>  <cit>  and cpowp <dig>  <cit>  and has been named ‘etowp6’. this family of proteins is expressed in wall forming bodies of macrogametes and the oocyst walls of t. gondii and cryptosporidium parvum  <cit> . importantly, etowp <dig> shares the domain architecture described for both tgowp <dig> and cpcowp <dig> , specifically the conservation of cysteine-rich type i repeats  <cit> , supporting its role as a structural component of the oocyst wall. quantitative rt-pcr confirmed the presence etowp <dig> transcript in e. tenella gametocytes but also in unsporulated oocysts . western blot using anti-etowp <dig> polyclonal antibody detected protein only in gametocyte stages , with three bands of  <dig>   <dig> and 41 kda  . it is unclear whether these bands represent different conformations of the one etowp <dig> protein or represent different cross-reactive targets. immunolocalisation studies of e. tenella-infected chicken intestine using this antibody revealed reactivity against wall-forming bodies type i of macrogametes, with gam <dig> antibody used as a counterstain for wall-forming bodies type ii  . surprisingly, etowp <dig> could not be detected in oocyst samples by either western blot  or immunolocalisation on both broken and unbroken oocysts , despite being detected in proteomic analyses of e. tenella oocyst walls  <cit> . one explanation may be that cross-linking of the cysteine-rich protein during oocyst wall assembly drastically reduced the affinity of this particular antibody; although the reduction and alkylation performed prior to western blot analyses should have been sufficient for breaking disulphide bonds.table  <dig>

an additional gene, eth_ <dig>  codes for a protein that was also detected by mass spectrometry in purified oocyst walls of e. tenella  <cit>  and is hereto referred to as ethowp <dig>  for e. tenella hypothetical oocyst wall protein  <dig>  unlike etowp <dig>  the ethowp <dig> transcript was detected exclusively in gametocyte stages of e. tenella . however, western blot analysis using anti-ethowp <dig> polyclonal antibody revealed a doublet band of approximately 40 kda in gametocytes, unsporulated oocysts and sporulated oocysts, with additional lower molecular weight bands of 30 kda and 23 kda in unsporulated and sporulated oocyst samples . this banding pattern is reminiscent of the proteolytic processing of tyrosine-rich proteins, gam <dig> and gam <dig>  prior to oocyst wall integration  <cit> ; although, in the case of ethowp <dig>  the larger 40 kda protein band persists in oocyst samples. in contrast to ethowp <dig> protein levels, ethowp <dig> transcript was detected only in gametocyte stages, a feature observed previously with etgam <dig>  <cit> . for etgam <dig>  the discrepancy between the gene transcript and protein levels is explained by the stockpiling of etgam <dig> protein in wfbii prior to oocyst wall assembly and the high stability of these proteins in the mature oocyst wall structure  <cit> . a similar observation was made for ethowp <dig>  which co-localised with etgam <dig> to wfbii , organelles characterised by their doughnut-like appearance . wfbii migrate to the periphery of macrogametes and form the inner layer of the developing oocyst wall  <cit> . accordingly, when intact and broken oocysts were probed with ethowp <dig> antisera, the protein was detected exclusively in the walls of broken oocysts since the inner layer of the oocyst wall is not accessible in intact oocysts . in summary, ethowp <dig> is a bona fide oocyst wall protein that, looking forward, should be considered as an attractive vaccine candidate.

also included in table  <dig> are genes that code for predicted surface proteins of e. tenella. of particular interest are eth_ <dig>  eth_ <dig>  eth_ <dig>  eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig>  whose cognate proteins share homology with an immunogenic sporozoite surface antigen  or ta <dig>  <cit> . another subset of predicted surface proteins are those containing pan domains , which are typically found in proteins involved in adhesion, including in microneme proteins  of e. tenella  <cit> . the role of these putative surface proteins in gametocyte biology remains to be investigated.

identification of macrogamete-specific subtilisins and oxidoreductases with putative roles in oocyst wall biosynthesis
while abundant oocyst wall proteins represent the structural building blocks for the coccidian oocyst wall, many of the processes accompanying their incorporation into this bilayered structure are also upregulated during gametocyte development . gam <dig>  for example, undergoes proteolysis into smaller tyrosine-rich peptides, prior to oocyst wall assembly  <cit> . in the present study, upregulated gametocyte transcripts coding for a number of different proteases were identified including; one serine metalloprotease precursor, one aminopeptidase, an aspartic protease  and seven subtilisins. subtilisins are responsible for processing tyrosine-rich proteins during e. tenella gametocyte development  <cit> . additional analysis of three subtilisins, etsub <dig>  etsub <dig> and etsub <dig>  demonstrated that etsub <dig> is the most specific to gametocytes ; etsub <dig> transcript abundance was significantly higher in gametocytes but was still present in oocyst stages, while etsub <dig> was significantly higher in unsporulated oocysts than in gametocytes. western blot analysis using anti-etsub <dig> polyclonal antibody detected a protein of approximately 60 kda in e. tenella gametocytes only ; the predicted size of  <dig>  kda is probably an underestimate due to the truncated gene model of eth_ <dig>  furthermore, immunolocalisation studies using the same antibody revealed localisation of this serine protease to e. tenella macrogametocytes , specifically to the periphery of the parasite cell and adjacent to wfbii .table  <dig>

cross-linking of the smaller tyrosine-rich proteins into dityrosine imparts further stability to the oocyst wall and evidence implicates the role of peroxidases in catalysing this reaction  <cit> . table  <dig> includes two peroxiredoxins , in addition to six genes coding for proteins with predicted oxidoreductase activities, potentially capable of cross-linking dityrosine. the amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase, copper-containing protein  is of particular interest since its possession of an extracellular mam -domain  <cit>  could place it at the site of oocyst wall biogenesis. quantitative rt-pcr confirmed etao <dig> as an upregulated gametocyte transcript . however, western blot analysis using anti-etao <dig> polyclonal antibody detected a single 120 kda protein in mature gametocytes and unsporulated oocysts . immunolocalisation studies with this antibody reveal that etao <dig> localises to macrogametes . although etao <dig> appears to localise as foci within the cytoplasm, the staining pattern is distinct from the wfbi or wfbii. aside from some augmented staining at the periphery of mature macrogametes , there was no observable staining to oocyst stages in tissue sections as might be expected of for an enzyme involved in oocyst wall assembly. it should be noted, however, that given the expected size of etao <dig> is predicted at 183 kda , some caution must be taken in interpreting results obtained with this antibody.figure  <dig>

gam <dig> and gam <dig> have both been shown to be heavily glycosylated  <cit> , a process that is linked to a co-regulated glycosylation pathway in eimeria  <cit> . in the present study, six upregulated gametocyte transcripts were identified that code for enzymes in the protein glycosylation pathway, including etgfat  , the primary enzyme in the amino sugar biosynthesis pathway that was previously localised to e. tenella macrogametes  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies have indicated the coccidian oocyst wall architecture is comprised not only of glycoproteins but also interlayered β- <dig> -glucan fibrils  <cit>  and an outer layer of acid-fast lipids  <cit> . glucan synthase, the enzyme catalysing the synthesis of β- <dig> -glucan fibrils, is coded by the gene eth_ <dig> whose transcript levels were upregulated 14-fold in e. tenella gametocytes compared to merozoites . a total of sixteen upregulated gametocyte transcripts code for proteins with predicted roles in synthesising or re-modelling the acid-fast lipid layer of the e. tenella oocyst wall  <cit> , including the previously described polyketide synthases, etpks <dig>  and etpks <dig> . note, the upregulated gametocyte transcript eth_ <dig> appears to code for an additional, as yet undescribed pks.

targeted inhibition of highly-divergent, parasite-specific biochemical pathways is yet another strategy for combating coccidian transmission; inhibition of glucan synthase has shown promise in reducing oocyst output in e. tenella  <cit> . the potential to block oocyst wall formation by inhibition of gametocyte-specific subtilisins and oxidoreductases warrants further investigation.

microgamete biology is underscored by numerous gametocyte targets, including the gamete fusion protein ethap <dig>  which localises to e. tenella microgametes
structural studies of e. tenella microgametes describe terminally differentiated stages comprised of a nucleus, a mitochondrion, a number of longitudinally running microtubules and two flagella ; in many respects their biology is analogous to that of eukaryotic sperm. while characterisation of microgamete-specific markers in the coccidia is limited, proteomic analyses of purified microgametes in the related apicomplexan, plasmodium berghei, has highlighted an important role for proteins involved in dna replication and the axoneme, a specialised cytoskeletal structure of eukaryotic flagella  <cit> . in the present study, genes coding for highly-conserved axoneme-associated proteins, including twenty dyneins, two radial spoke head proteins, two basal body proteins and one central apparatus protein were identified as upregulated gametocyte transcripts . eth_ <dig>  the most abundant of these microgamete-specific transcripts, codes for an armadillo/beta-catenin-like repeat protein that is a homologue of pf <dig>  a microgamete protein of plasmodium falciparum. pf <dig> is a component of the axoneme central apparatus and is essential for microgamete motility and fertilisation  <cit> . likewise, eth_ <dig> shows homology to a protein, tax- <dig> , required for motility in the flagellated parasite, trypanosoma brucei  <cit> . also listed in table  <dig> are genes coding for an additional eight flagellar-associated proteins and for proteins with predicted non-flagellar functions. protamine , for instance, is a histone-like protein that binds sperm dna, condensing the genome into an inactive state  <cit> , while calmegin  is a testis-specific er protein that functions as a protein chaperone and is required for fertility  <cit> . aat- <dig>  protein  is predicted to have versatile functions in spermatogenesis, including the modulation of energy required for fertilisation  <cit> , while enkurin  is expressed in mammalian sperm and is thought to be involved in signal transduction pathways of fertilisation during gamete fusion  <cit> .table  <dig>

finally, two upregulated gametocyte transcripts, eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig>  are tandemly located in the e. tenella genome and code for proteins with homology to a family of transmembrane proteins, known as hap2-gcs <dig>  whose expression is restricted to male gametes in a range of different organisms  <cit> . each of these genes aligns to different regions of an e. tenella ‘gcs1’ mrna sequence  implying a misprediction of both eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig> exon models . mapping of gametocyte rna seq reads to the e. tenella genome supported that the two hap2-like genes are actually part of one contiguous gene transcript ; in fact, the canonical hap <dig> domain is located in what is currently predicted as an intergenic region of the e. tenella genome, highlighting the current pitfalls in gene prediction models not informed by transcriptome data. subsequent rt-pcr and sequencing of the ethap <dig> transcript confirmed this observation and revealed 100% of identity to the genbank mrna sequence, herein used as the ethap <dig> cds.figure  <dig> 
new gene model codes for a canonical gcs1-hap <dig> protein, ethap <dig>    upregulated gametocyte transcripts, eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig>  were originally predicted as separate, tandemly positioned genes. exons  are separated by introns , while the intergenic regions are indicated by a broken black line. the position of the genomic sequence coding for a putative gcs1-hap <dig> domain is indicated by a green box.  gametocyte rna seq reads were mapped to the e. tenella genome in either a 5’ – 3’  or 3’ – 5’  orientation. gaps in the mapping of individual reads  indicate the putative position of introns.  coverage of mapped reads  also indicates the position of putative exons.  rt-pcr revealed that eth_ <dig> and eth_ <dig> are actually part of a single ethap <dig> transcript. exons of this transcript are indicated as blue boxes, while separating introns are indicated as a blue line. the resulting ethap <dig> coding sequence reads from right  to left .  multiple alignment of amino acid sequences corresponding to the hap <dig> domains of e. tenella , t. gondii , p. berghei  and c. reinhardtii . blue shading is proportional to levels of conservation between the four species. amino acid sequence limits are indicated to the right.  the domain architecture of the ethap <dig> protein is illustrated . an n-terminal signal peptide is followed by an extracellular region , a transmembrane domain , and a c-terminal intracellular domain containing a lysine/arginine-rich domain .



the expression of hap <dig> in plasmodium is restricted to microgametes and is required for gamete fusion and subsequent fertilisation  <cit> . the hap <dig> domains of ethap <dig> and pbhap <dig> are partially conserved , with further sequence identity being observed in the hap <dig> domains of crhap <dig>   <cit>  and a putative tghap <dig>  . although sequence homology outside this domain is limited, the general architecture of the ethap <dig> protein, including the presence of a signal peptide, extracellular hap <dig> domain, single transmembrane domain and an intracellular, positively-charged  c-terminal region , is as described previously for hap2-gsc <dig> proteins  <cit> .

the extracellular hap <dig> domain is thought to act as a fusogen, mediating membrane fusion between mating gametes  <cit> . antibodies raised against the hap <dig> domain of ethap <dig> reacted specifically with microgametes of e. tenella, with no observable reactivity with either macrogametes or developing oocysts . ethap <dig> staining appeared more intense in late-stage  microgametes than either mid-stage or early-stage microgametes, consistent with a predicted role in fertilisation. efforts to determine the subcellular localisation of ethap <dig> revealed a distribution pattern distinct from that of the microgamete nucleus and mitochondrion, organelles that appear as near-continuous, dapi-positive structures . beyond this, it was difficult to confirm whether ethap <dig> localisation was cytoplasmic, surface or, less likely, as part of the flagella. in the flowering plant, arabidopsis thaliana, hap <dig> redistributes from the cytoplasm to the surface of sperm cells upon contact with a cysteine-rich protein and potential ligand, ec- <dig>   <cit> . likewise, it is conceivable that ethap <dig> is exposed at the surface of microgametes only after attachment to macrogametes during fertilisation.figure  <dig>

evidence suggests that unfertilised eimeria macrogametes fail to develop into mature oocysts and/or are non-infective due to a failure to sporulate  <cit> . therefore, disturbing the biological processes of microgametes, including motility and gamete fusion, is another promising strategy to block the transmission of apicomplexan parasites.

the fundamental biological processes of sexual stage development and oocyst formation are broadly conserved in the coccidia. it would be expected, therefore, that many of the e. tenella gametocyte proteins identified in the present study would be biologically conserved in t. gondii. indeed, sequence homology searching of the t. gondii genome database  revealed that tgme49_ <dig>  may be the structural orthologue of ethowp <dig>  although the two proteins share only  <dig> % sequence identity  . importantly, tghowp <dig> was identified previously in a proteomic analysis of purified t. gondii oocyst walls  <cit> . in the present study, polyclonal antisera raised against a tghowp1-gst fusion protein specifically stained t. gondii macrogametes in sections of infected cat intestine, while merozoites  remained unstained . tghowp <dig> appeared to localise to organelles resembling wall forming bodies, although the lack of a wfb marker in t. gondii makes this observation somewhat presumptive.figure  <dig>

a putative orthologue of etao <dig> was also identified in t. gondii , although like ethap <dig>  the protein is predicted to be encoded by two adjacent genes, tgme49_ <dig> and tgme49_ <dig>  preliminary data from rna seq analysis of t. gondii gametocytes  confirms that these two exon models actually represent a single tgao <dig> gene transcript, as predicted in a previous version of the t. gondii genome assembly . the protein sequences of etao <dig> and tgao <dig>  share  <dig> % sequence identity, although this extends to  <dig> % for the extracellular mam domain and  <dig> % for the copper amine oxidase domain . antibody raised against a tgao2-gst fusion protein corresponding to the entire mam domain reacted specifically against t. gondii macrogametes, like etao <dig>  localising to distinct cytoplasmic foci . in contrast to etao <dig>  additional staining was also observed on the surface of early oocysts , consistent with a possible role for tgao <dig> in cross-linking tyrosine-rich proteins in the developing oocyst wall of t. gondii.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a comparative rna seq transcriptomics approach led to the identification of hundreds of genes specifically expressed in e. tenella gametocytes. this data set represents a snapshot of the mechanisms at play in coccidian sexual biology and also highlights previously undescribed transmission blocking targets – in particular, two oocyst wall proteins, a subtilisin, an oxidoreductase and a microgamete-specific gamete fusion protein. with so many hypothetical genes identified, further functional characterisation will be paramount for determining the key players in distinct sexual stage processes, including microgamete motility, fertilization and oocyst wall biogenesis. as the transmission blocking potential of these eimeria targets are assessed in future studies, wider implications can be expected in related coccidia, like toxoplasma, where transmission blocking remains a relatively unexplored control strategy.
