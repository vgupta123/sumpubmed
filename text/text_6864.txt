BACKGROUND
apoptosis, a distinctive and highly regulated type of cell suicide, is fundamental for various biological processes such as development  <cit> , tissue homeostasis, dna damage response  <cit>  and immune response  <cit> . development of holometabolous insects is characterized by a complete metamorphosis between the wingless larval stage, mostly dedicated to nutrient acquisition and growth, and the winged adult form, dedicated to reproduction. these drastic modifications in appearance and physiology require massive histolysis and histogenesis. the importance of apoptotic events during development of holometabolous insects and more specifically in lepidoptera has been shown as early as the 1960's. in wild silkmoths and the tobacco hawkmoth, the first ecdysone peak during metamorphosis induces apoptotic degeneration of the larval intersegmental muscles, proleg motoneurons, and labial glands  <cit> . the decrease in ecdysone titer shortly before hatching induces apoptotic degeneration of abdominal neurons and intersegmental muscles  <cit> . important changes in food habits between larval and adult stages imply extensive remodeling of the digestive tract. for example, in galleria mellonella, the larval midgut undergoes apoptosis during metamorphosis  <cit> . similarly, in heliothis virescens, apoptosis of the larval midgut has been correlated with higher caspase expression shortly before and after pupation  <cit> . among the different protective measures triggered by the insect immune system to thwart pathogen infection, host cell suicide through apoptosis can significantly reduce viral replication, dissemination and infectivity  <cit> .

a major family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases, called caspases, plays a central role in apoptosis. studies on alpha-proteobacteria, closely related species of the free-living ancestor of mitochondria, revealed the presence of genes similar to caspases, suggesting that ancestor of eukaryotic caspases derived from mitochondrial endosymbionts  <cit> . ancestors of caspase genes then evolved into 'metacaspases' in plants and fungi, 'paracaspases' in slime, molds and animals and in 'true caspases' in animals. the number of "true" caspase genes differs greatly among animal lineages with as little as  <dig> genes in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> ,  <dig> in the sea anemone nematostella vectensis,  <dig> in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster  <cit> ,  <dig> and  <dig> in the mosquitoes anopheles gambiae and aedes aegypti respectively  <cit> ,  <dig> in human  <cit> , to up to  <dig> in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the host-pathogen interaction has been one of the major evolutionary forces shaping the apoptotic machinery and therefore the caspase repertoire  <cit> .

the caspase family is divided into two groups: the inflammatory caspases and the apoptotic caspases composed of the initiator and the effector subgroups. to date, dedicated inflammatory caspases seem to be restricted to mammals. although a non-apoptotic role of some lepidopteran caspases should not be excluded at this stage, the description of inflammatory caspases will not be considered further here. apoptotic caspases are synthesized in the cell as catalytically inactive forms. all members of the caspase family share a canonical structure consisting of a prodomain and a catalytic domain named "peptidase c14" . the catalytic domain is formed by  <dig> subunits, a large one of about  <dig> kda, also known as p <dig>  and a small one of about  <dig> kda, also referred as p <dig>  upon proteolytic processing of the proenzyme, the two subunits form a heterodimer and the active caspase enzyme is made of the association of two of these heterodimers. the enzymatic activity of caspases shows strong cleavage site specificity towards a four amino-acid motif ending with an aspartate residue  <cit> . in contrast to the catalytic domain, which is structurally conserved, the prodomain varies significantly among caspases. the characteristic binding sites  and active sites  are conserved in all caspases except in d. melanogaster dronc  <cit> . whereas effector caspases have a short prodomain of about  <dig> amino acids, initiator caspases have a prodomain of  <dig> or more amino acids  <cit> . long prodomains usually harbor structures belonging to the death domain superfamily, such as death effector domain  or caspase recruitment domain , which are involved in the recruitment and subsequent activation of initiator caspases by death receptors or by the apoptosome  <cit> .

in the pro-apoptotic proteolytic cascade, initiator caspases are activated first, and these in turn activate the effector caspases. the latter are responsible for the cleavage of many cellular components  <cit> , leading to the characteristic features of apoptotic cells such as dna fragmentation and membrane blebbing  <cit> . in mammals, in the extrinsic pathway, the binding of a "death" ligand to its receptor changes the receptor conformation, allowing the recruitment of an adaptor protein such as fadd and of initiator caspase- <dig>  the formation of this complex leads to the autoactivation of caspase- <dig> . the intrinsic pathway is activated in response to intracellular signals which induce a permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane, allowing the release in the cytosol of several proteins such as smac/diablo and cytochrome c. cytochrome c forms a protein complex with apaf  <dig> called the apoptosome, which recruits the initiator caspase- <dig> leading to its subsequent activation. caspase- <dig> and - <dig> are both able to activate the effector caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . in drosophila, there is no evidence of an extrinsic pathway, and the formation of the apoptosome with dark, the homolog of apaf  <dig>  and dronc, the homolog of caspase- <dig>  does not require cytochrome c  <cit> . dronc then activates the effector caspase drice. homologs of the core components of the apoptosis machinery found in drosophila have also been described in mosquitoes, suggesting that apoptosis is regulated in a similar fashion in mosquitoes  <cit> .

in lepidoptera, very little is known about apoptotic molecular pathways . the discovery in the early 1990's of p <dig>  a baculovirus pan-caspase inhibitor  <cit> , has led to the characterization of the first lepidopteran caspase, sf-caspase- <dig>  from the sf <dig> cell line derived from the noctuid moth spodoptera frugiperda  <cit> . later, the likely orthologs from s. littoralis  <cit> , helicoverpa armigera  <cit>  and trichoplusia ni  <cit>  were also characterized. members of this caspase- <dig> group have been shown to act as effector caspases, but so far no other classes of caspases have been described in lepidoptera. the existence of an "apical" caspase responsible for the activation of sf-caspase- <dig> has been suggested  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> other baculovirus proteins, p <dig> and iap  <cit>  have been shown to inhibit apoptosis in sf <dig> cells by blocking the processing of sf-caspase- <dig>  suggesting that the likely target of these  <dig> inhibitors may be an apical caspase, tentatively named sf-caspase x. so far, this caspase x has not been characterized, but these results suggest that, in lepidoptera, apoptosis requires a cascade of caspase activation, similar to other organisms.

in an attempt to characterize the caspase gene family in lepidopteran insects, we first surveyed the recently sequenced genome of the silkworm bombyx mori  <cit> , as well as publicly available and 'in-house' est datasets. from these, we retrieved  <dig> transcripts encoding putative caspases from  <dig> species of butterflies and moths. phylogenetic analyses showed that these genes clustered into  <dig> distinct clades , three of which are classified as putative effector caspases, two corresponding to putative initiator caspases and one that could not be readily classified as either. we propose a naming convention for these genes based on our phylogenetic analyses. finally, we discovered that one of the caspase subfamilies  is absent from the genome of the silkworm, has evolved from a tandem gene duplication of caspase- <dig>  is under purifying selection which however is more relaxed than for caspase- <dig>  and is likely to be restricted to species of the family noctuidae.

RESULTS
lepidopteran caspases cluster into six distinct clades
as the genome of the silkworm bombyx mori is the sole fully sequenced genome for insects of the order lepidoptera to date, we first searched it for the presence of putative caspase genes . we identified a total of  <dig> genes, one on chromosome  <dig> , three at various places on chromosome  <dig>  and one on chromosome  <dig>  . our findings are in agreement with a genome-wide analysis of the bombyx mori genome for apoptosis-related genes, in which these  <dig> caspase genes have also been identified  <cit> . to get further insight into this gene family, we then mined publicly available as well as "in-house" est datasets for transcripts encoding putative caspase enzymes. we retrieved a total of  <dig> transcripts corresponding to  <dig> different genes, from  <dig> species of moths and butterflies spanning  <dig> lepidopteran families . caspase sequences were accepted if they fulfilled the following criteria: presence of the characteristic binding site  and/or active site , and level of amino acid identity . a bayesian inferred phylogenetic analysis clustered these sequences into six distinct clades , revealing an extra caspase gene family that was not found in the b. mori genome . this observed number of caspase genes in lepidoptera is similar to the seven genes found in drosophila species: drice, dcp- <dig>  decay, damm, dronc, dredd and strica   <cit> .

to facilitate our analysis at this stage, we decided to establish a naming convention for these genes based on the results of the phylogenetic analyses. the first caspase fully characterized for a lepidopteran insect has been named caspase- <dig> preceded by the initials sf, corresponding to the name of the species spodoptera frugiperda  <cit> . we extended this convention by naming each caspase starting with the initials of the species from which it has been isolated, followed by "-caspase" and by a number depending on which clade the sequence clustered into. clades were arbitrarily numbered caspase- <dig> to caspase- <dig>  the term "lep" was added to the cluster name to differentiate lepidopteran caspases from sequences derived from other organisms. when splicing variants were found , we used the nomenclature proposed by alnemri et al in which each variant is identified by a letter  <cit> . here we stress the point that our nomenclature does not reflect any orthology between lepidopteran caspases and mammalian ones. for example, lep-caspase- <dig> is not an ortholog of human caspase- <dig> 

classification of the lepidopteran caspases
the phylogenetic analysis clustered lep-caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> with dcp- <dig>  drice and decay . these  <dig> drosophila caspases have been classified as effectors due to their short prodomain, their substrate specificity toward the tetrapeptide devd and their ability to cleave the poly  polymerase and/or p <dig>  <cit> . lep-caspase- <dig> and - <dig> also harbor a short prodomain, characteristic of effector caspases . however, no suitable cleavage site between the prodomain and the large subunit could be found in lep-caspase- <dig>  and an amino acid alignment of lep-caspase- <dig> and - <dig> sequences suggests that the latter lacks a prodomain . caspase- <dig> has already been characterized in s. frugiperda and s. littoralis. these studies demonstrated substrate specificity toward devd  <cit>  and the ability to cleave p <dig> similar to the drosophila effector caspases  <cit> . although drice and dcp- <dig> are highly similar in sequence, several studies have shown that drice and not dcp- <dig> is the main effector caspase in drosophila  <cit> . a study comparing the effect of single and double mutants for drice and dcp- <dig> showed that these two caspases have an overlapping function  <cit> . the role of decay has still to be clarified. finally, based on another phylogenetic analysis including all the known mosquito caspase sequences  <cit> , we find no clear orthology between lepidopteran and dipteran effector caspases, which is due to the rapid evolution and diversity of this gene family .

like the drosophila dronc, to which it is closely related, and human caspase- <dig>  lep-caspase- <dig> harbors a card domain within its long prodomain . typical card domains are constituted by a bundle of  <dig> alpha helices. an amino acid alignment of the prodomain of card containing caspases, including b. mori caspase- <dig>  shows a low amino acid conservation, but a high conservation of the position of the  <dig> alpha helices . card domains are involved in the interaction of initiator caspases with ark/apaf <dig>  to form the apoptosome which is required for the activation of dronc/human caspase- <dig>  <cit> . it has been shown that dronc is ubiquitously expressed during the development of drosophila and that its expression is stimulated by ecdysone during metamorphosis  <cit> . lep-caspase- <dig> is closely related to drosophila dredd. the presence, in the long prodomain, of  <dig> motifs composed of  <dig> alpha helices, forming a three-dimensional structure characteristic of the death domain family , strongly supports its classification as an initiator caspase  <cit> . an amino acid alignment of b. mori caspase- <dig> with other death domain-containing caspases from human and diptera shows again a low amino acid conservation, but the position of the alpha helices is conserved . despite the first description of dredd as a potential initiator caspase  <cit> , it now appears to be more important in activating the innate immune response upon infection by gram negative bacteria  <cit> . based on a phylogenetic analysis including all the known mosquito caspase sequences, it is clear that lep-caspase- <dig> and lep-caspase- <dig> are the orthologs of dipteran dronc and dredd, respectively .

despite a relatively long prodomain, lep-caspase- <dig> does not harbor any known death domain which would have supported its classification as an initiator caspase . the phylogenetic analyses show a relationship with the drosophila caspases damm and strica, for which the function has not been clearly defined yet. lepidopteran caspase- <dig> sequences share about 20% amino acid identity with strica/damm homologs from flies and mosquitoes, but do not harbor any serine-threonine-rich regions in the prodomain  <cit> . although damm and strica are very similar in sequence, they appear to play different roles in d. melanogaster: damm seems to be an effector caspase  <cit> , whereas strica seems to be an initiator caspase, exhibiting redundant activity with dronc during oogenesis based on genetic studies  <cit> . within the  <dig> sequenced drosophila species, damm is a more recent duplication of the ancestral strica, as damm is restricted to the melanogaster and obscura groups  <cit> . perhaps the ancestral strica was an initiator caspase in diptera. another unusual feature of lep-caspase- <dig> is its unique small subunit. it is twice as long as any other small subunit described so far, which usually ends  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids after the conserved serine residue  involved in substrate binding . in addition, alignments  show that the sequence corresponding to the last  <dig> residues of the small subunit is more variable compared to the rest of the subunit. however some residues are conserved in all sequences, including  <dig> cysteine residues potentially involved in the formation of secondary structures. these features indicate that lep-caspase- <dig> is a peculiar caspase, the function of which cannot be solely assessed by sequence comparisons.

alternative splicing of caspase- <dig> and - <dig> in b. mori
in b. mori, two isoforms of caspase- <dig> have been identified, a long form  and a short form  in which the exon encoding the sequence corresponding to the catalytic site is spliced out . the short form still possesses an intact prodomain and small subunit. in human, caspase- <dig> splicing variants have been identified. in one of them, caspase-9s, the catalytic site is missing and this isoform has been shown to be a dominant-negative inhibitor of apoptosis, by blocking the caspase-9/apaf <dig> interaction  <cit> . enzymatically inactive caspase homologs that have arisen by gene duplication events have been recently described in diptera  <cit> . these caspase-like decoy molecules may have acquired the ability to regulate other caspases. the short form of bm-caspase- <dig> might have evolved a similar decoy function by alternate splicing, however we could not find any separate genes encoding caspase-like decoy molecules in our analyses. although several isoforms of caspase- <dig> were observed in b. mori, only a single transcript could be detected in h. armigera. in addition, the sequences corresponding to exon  <dig> and  <dig> in b. mori are part of a single exon in h. armigera, so a product like b. mori caspase-5b could not be produced by alternate splicing in the latter species.

three splicing variants were detected for bm-caspase- <dig> , all of them harboring both catalytic and binding sites. alternative splicing was not observed for ha-caspase- <dig>  it has been suggested that catalytically active isoforms may differ in specificity and efficiency, which could fine-tune caspase activity through hetero-dimerization, resulting in amplification or inhibition of apoptosis  <cit> .

a noctuid-specific caspase gene arose from duplication of caspase-1
thorough mining of lepidopteran est datasets for putative caspase- <dig> led us to find the corresponding genes only in species of the family noctuidae . no ortholog of caspase- <dig> could be found in the silkworm genome . taking into account that the amino acid identity between lep-caspase- <dig> and lep-caspase- <dig> sequences is relatively high , we hypothesized that both genes may have arisen, in noctuidae, from a tandem gene duplication event. to test this hypothesis, we screened a h. armigera bac library using probes designed according to either the ha-caspase- <dig> or the ha-caspase- <dig> sequence. a bac clone  hit by both probes was identified and selected for sequencing. the caspase- <dig> and - <dig> genes were found, in a  <dig> kb fragment of this bac, to be organized in tandem, separated by only  <dig> kb of non-coding dna, were in the same orientation  and had no intron , confirming our hypothesis. we then compared the organization of the genes surrounding caspase- <dig> between h. armigera and b. mori , we found a high degree of micro-synteny in this region of the genome between the two species, similar to what has been reported in recent studies  <cit> .

to examine the relative rates of sequence evolution within the caspase- <dig> and - <dig> subfamilies since divergence, pairwise comparisons of sequences obtained from noctuid species were performed by applying the nei-gojobori algorithm  <cit>  . mean of synonymous substitutions per site  was  <dig>  and  <dig>  within caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> respectively; mean ds between caspase- <dig> and - <dig> is  <dig> , indicating saturation. mean non-synonymous substitutions per site  was  <dig>  for caspase- <dig> and  <dig>  for caspase- <dig>  we used the codon-based z-test  <cit>  to test the null hypothesis ds = dn which would indicate that both genes are neutrally evolving. we could reject this null hypothesis as we found that dn is significantly smaller than ds , indicating a strong purifying selection on both genes. we also tested whether synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates differ between the two genes  we could not reject that dscasp <dig> = dscasp <dig>  but the non-synonymous substitution rate in caspase- <dig> was significantly higher compared to the one in caspase- <dig> . the coefficient of functional divergence  <cit> , which measures the overall difference between site-specific substitutions among the two subfamilies is θ =  <dig> , which is significantly greater than zero . these results strongly suggest that caspase- <dig>  though also under purifying selection following the duplication event, has evolved under much more relaxed selective constraints than caspase- <dig>  it has been well documented that gene duplication is often followed by a period of relaxed selective constraints on one of the duplicate, allowing it to accumulate more mutations  <cit> . although it has been suggested that gene duplication occurs at a high rate of  <dig> /gene/million years, the most common fate of duplicated genes is silencing and loss  <cit> . in some cases however, the duplicate is retained as functional gene and either a new function is acquired by one of the copies or the ancestral function is maintained or subdivided between the two copies  <cit> . the fact that the cleavage site differ between the two subunits , and that caspase- <dig> may lack a prodomain, suggests that they might be activated by different signals. this could indicate a subfunctionalization of caspase- <dig> in noctuidae.

ms-caspase- <dig> subfamily has evolved through duplication events
several contigs corresponding to putative caspase- <dig> transcripts were identified from an est dataset derived from a m. sexta larval midgut cdna library, sequenced by  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . analyses of complete sequences obtained by race-pcr resulted in  <dig> distinct cdnas. two of them, ms-caspase-4-1/a and -4-1/b, differ only by  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms ,  <dig> of which are non-synonymous, as well as an extra codon encoding asn <dig> in ms-caspase-4-1/b . the third sequence, ms-caspase-4- <dig>  encodes a protein sharing ~63% amino acid identity with both ms-caspase-4-1/a and -4-1/b . the occurrence of several unique transcripts for lep-caspase- <dig> has only been found in that species so far. a closer look at the region where bm-caspase- <dig> is located on the silkworm genome did not reveal any extra lep-caspase- <dig> genes or even pseudogenes nearby bm-caspase- <dig> . these results suggest that caspase- <dig> has undergone at least two duplication events in m. sexta. a phylogenetic study of dipteran caspases suggest that damm and strica, the homologs of lep-caspase- <dig>  have arisen by duplication in the melanogaster and obscura clades, while only strica is present in the other drosophilid clades  <cit> . in mosquitoes, the ancestor of damm/strica has undergone many duplication events after the divergence of the anopheles gambiae, culex quinquefasciatus and aedes aegypti lineages. two homologs of damm/strica have been described in a. gambiae, as well as  <dig> in c. quinquefasciatus and  <dig> in a. aegypti  <cit> . all of the duplicates are potentially active since they all harbor the critical amino acids involved in binding and active sites. however, no biochemical characterization has been carried out on these caspases so far. the paucity of est data for members of the family sphingidae does not allow us to conclude whether the duplication of lep-caspase- <dig> is specific only to m. sexta or if it has also happened in sister species.

CONCLUSIONS
despite obvious limitations of est datasets in term of available species and transcriptome coverage, we were able to identify  <dig> caspase genes coming from  <dig> different lepidopteran species. based on the phylogenetic analyses, we showed that the lepidopteran caspase family is represented by at least  <dig> members. nevertheless, the biochemical characterization of these caspases has to be performed to clarify the exact function and their potential interactions. the main shaping forces of the caspase gene family in mammals as well as in other insects, such as mosquitoes, are gene deletions and gene innovations by duplication events  <cit> . although we cannot assess whether deletions of caspase genes has happened in lepidoptera, our data suggest that gene duplication is one of the shaping forces of this gene family in these insects. availability in the near future of whole genome sequences and transcriptomes from other species of the order lepidoptera as well as from other insect orders, will improve our understanding of the complexity of this gene family and its evolutionary history in insects in general.
