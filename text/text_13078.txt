BACKGROUND
dlk <dig> encodes for a transmembrane glycoprotein with six epidermal growth factor-like  motifs in the extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain and a short intracellular tail. these features place dlk <dig> as a member of the egf-like family of proteins, in which notch receptors and their ligands are included  <cit> . the proteins of this family mediate protein-protein interactions through their egf-like repeats, modulating cell fate differentiation in numerous cell types. dlk <dig> shares most of its structural features with dlk <dig>  with the highest homology located at the egf-like domains. dlk <dig> participates in several differentiation processes, including adipogenesis  <cit> , differentiation of hepatocytes  <cit> , hematopoiesis  <cit> , osteogenesis  <cit> , adrenal gland and neuroendocrine cell differentiation  <cit> , peripheral and central nervous system differentiation  <cit> , growth arrest, and increased malignancy of undifferentiated tumors  <cit> . dlk <dig> has also been reported to participate in the wound healing process  <cit> . dlk <dig> has been shown to participate also in adipogenesis  <cit> , but its role in other differentiation processes is yet unknown.

dlk <dig> expression can be detected in several adult mouse tissues, showing a more widespread pattern of expression than dlk <dig>  dlk <dig> is highly expressed in lung, brain, adipose tissue, testicles, adult liver, placenta, ovaries and thymus  <cit> . little is known about the regulation of dlk <dig> expression, although it seems clear that the expression of dlk <dig> and dlk <dig> appears to be coordinated in some instances in vitro. thus, their expression levels in response to cell confluence vary in opposite directions. interestingly, when the expression level of one homolog is modified in one direction, the enforced change exerts an opposite effect on the expression level of the other, both in 3t3-l <dig> and c3h10t1/ <dig> cells  <cit> . that seemingly coordinated expression appears to occur also during tissue development: along mouse embryogenesis and postnatal growth, dlk <dig> is highly expressed during the development of fetal liver, when no expression of dlk <dig> is detected; dlk <dig> expression in liver can only be detected  <dig> days after birth  <cit> . all these data suggest the likely existence of coordinated control mechanisms for dlk <dig> and dlk <dig> gene expression.

previous to this work, in the ucsc genome browser , three full-length transcripts, bc <dig>  bc <dig>  and bc <dig>  had been assigned to dlk <dig>  the main differences among those dlk <dig> transcripts are restricted to the 5' end of the mrna, with most of the transcripts being identical in the majority of mrna's 3' regions. to the best of our knowledge, experimental support regarding any of the three abovementioned transcripts is lacking, excluding a few publications regarding the role of dlk <dig>  <cit> . in this paper, we describe the first experimental characterization of dlk <dig> transcription, showing that only one out of the three predicted transcripts, bc <dig>  could be detected in all the mouse cell lines and tissues analyzed. we have also mapped the transcription initiation site, which correlates with the abovementioned transcript, although with  <dig> additional bp at the 5' end. the dlk <dig> core promoter is located within a cpg island extending beyond the transcription start site . bioinformatics analysis showed the presence of two core promoter elements, the initiator element , and the downstream promoter element , which have been described as necessary for basal transcription in other genes. finally, as it is characteristic of tata-less promoters with an inr element, we have shown that sp <dig>  a member of the sp/klf family of zinc finger transcription factors that recognize gc/gt boxes present in many gc-rich promoters, is able to bind to the dlk <dig> promoter and control dlk <dig> basal transcription.

RESULTS
characterization of dlk <dig> mrna
mouse dlk <dig> is a gene located at chromosome  <dig> , containing six exons. previous to this work, three mrnas have been associated to dlk <dig> in genbank:   . bc <dig> and bc <dig> show almost the same exon-intron distribution, just differing in the second exon of bc <dig>  which is not present in bc <dig>  bc <dig> share the last four exons with the former two mrnas. however, the transcription start site and the splicing sites for the first and second exons are different between the two sets of mrnas clones, bc118057/bc <dig> and bc <dig>  surprisingly, bc <dig> has been considered as a chimeric cdna for the last few years, although it has been the cdna routinely used by our research group, and the only one appearing in the few publications regarding dlk <dig>  <cit> . thus, our first objective was to confirm or refute if bc <dig> was indeed a real cdna, and to analyze which of the three mrnas assigned to dlk <dig> are expressed in different mouse tissues and cell lines. considering the differences among the mrnas, and to facilitate the nomenclature of the transcripts, we classified them in two groups, according to the position of their tss: a first group, including bc <dig> and bc <dig>  was named as variant  <dig>  ; a second group, including only bc <dig>  was named variant  <dig> . we next designed specific oligonucleotides capable to discriminating between v <dig> and v <dig> , and studied by rt-pcr whether any, or both dlk <dig> mrna variants described above were present in total rnas from different origins. we prepare cdna from total rna extracted from heart, spleen, testis, brain, and lung of adult 129/c <dig> mice. the rest of the cdnas were prepared separately from different mouse cell lines in which dlk <dig> is expressed, including 3t3-l <dig>  nih3t <dig>  c3h10t1/ <dig> and at3f cells  <cit>  . lastly, mouse genomic dna was used as a control for primer amplification. as shown in figure 1b, both pcr primer sets were able to amplify the expected dna fragments from the genomic dna sample. however, when cdna was used as a template, either from tissues or from each cell line, only the v2u/vl oligonucleotide pair could amplify a fragment of the expected size from all the samples . the v1u/vl oligonucleotide pair could not amplify a dna fragment of the expected size in any of the nine samples analyzed. however, when brain cdna was used as a template, and the pcr conditions were pushed to try to amplify any trace cdna, a faint  <dig> bp fragment could be detected . our data thus indicated that only the v <dig> transcript can be detected in all the samples analyzed, suggesting that clone bc <dig> derives from a real mrna and it is not an artifact. it can also be concluded that v <dig> transcripts, as they have been described in the genomic databases, are not present in the tissues and cell lines tested in this work or, if they are, their abundance is much lower than that of the v <dig> transcript. it is interesting to note the possible existence of a different, yet uncharacterized, splice variant that can only be detected in brain, which we plan to analyze in detail in future studies.

to further characterize the dlk <dig> mrna, we next focused on mapping the tss. we first analyzed the expression level of dlk <dig> in several cell lines, and decided to use the mouse hepatoma cell line at3f as a source of rna, due to its high level of dlk <dig> expression . we used the rapid amplification of cdna ends assay  to map the 5' region of dlk <dig> mrna. using a dlk <dig> specific oligonucleotide, we amplified a unique  <dig> bp dna band . this pcr product was next cloned into the vector pcr <dig>   and twenty independent clones were selected for dna sequencing. our sequence data first showed that all clones contained exons that were only compatible with the v <dig> variant and, therefore, also with the exon-intron distribution of the cdna clone bc <dig> . in addition, most of the clones  contained  <dig> additional bases as a 5' extension when compared to the sequence of bc <dig>  and the remaining 25% contained shorter 5' extensions. the complete dlk <dig> mrna sequence, which starts at an a located  <dig> bases upstream of the atg start of protein translation, has been submitted to genbank with the entry number fm <dig> .

taken together, our data indicate that in the tissues and cell lines analyzed, the only dlk <dig> mrna species that could be detected is solely compatible with the cdna clone bc <dig> and, at least in the at3f cell line, that mrna possesses a  <dig> bp 5' extension as compared to this clone. once the tss was located, our data also suggested that the sequences in charge of controlling dlk <dig> gene expression were probably placed in the surroundings of exon e1b .

transcriptional analysis of the dlk <dig> promoter region
we decided to analyze the basal transcriptional regulation of the dlk <dig> promoter region around  <dig> kbp upstream of the tss. to do that, we cloned a  <dig>  bp dna fragment spanning from position - <dig>  to + <dig>  into the pgl3basic vector. we also made a series of constructs in the same vector, containing different 5' deletions of that fragment . all the constructs were tested for their transcriptional activity by transfecting them into nih3t <dig> cells and measuring their corresponding induced luciferase activity. all the luciferase measurements were normalized against the renilla activity of the prl-tk vector. our results showed that the largest fragment, - <dig> /+ <dig>  displayed a very low transcriptional activity, as it happened also with the first three deletions studied, -910/+ <dig>  -710/+ <dig>  and -575/+ <dig> . surprisingly, the maximum luciferase activity of the dlk <dig> promoter region was obtained with the fragments -375/+ <dig> and -212/+ <dig>  corresponding to deletions eliminating most of the 5' region of the longest fragment, indicating that the core promoter is located within those fragments. to confirm the position of the core promoter, we made an internal deletion in clone -375/+ <dig>  in the vicinity of the tss , that we called -375/+1Δ. as shown in figure  <dig>  the internal  <dig> bp deletion in the -375/+1Δ dna fragment caused a marked decrease in its basal transcriptional activity. our data allowed the location of the minimal dna sequence with promoter activity in the - <dig> to + <dig> region, and showed that the sequence located between - <dig> and - <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of dlk <dig> transcription.

the fact that longer dna fragments showed lower transcriptional activity than shorter fragments suggested the existence of transcriptional inhibitory sequences located between positions - <dig>  and - <dig>  to test that hypothesis, we decided to use the pgl3promoter vector, which shows a higher basal transcriptional activity due to the presence of the strong sv <dig> promoter. we generated four deletions of the fragment - <dig> /- <dig>  which were cloned into pgl3promoter, and we tested their transcriptional activity in nih3t <dig> cells. as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  all constructs showed a statistically significant reduction of around 30% in their luciferase activity when compared to the pgl3promoter control vector, thus indicating the existence of sequences able to repressing the transcriptional activity of the sv <dig> promoter. at this stage we decided to check the publically available genomic map of chromatin modifications performed in cells with different degrees of differentiation  <cit> . in that map, the methylation of certain lysine residues of histone h <dig>  is mapped, and is correlated with the activity of the promoter. according to that map, dlk <dig> presents two regions with h <dig> methylation corresponding to repressed chromatin: one with exclusive h3k27me <dig> methylation in the region - <dig> /- <dig>  and another one with double methylation h3k27me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> . interestingly, the inhibitory region we have mapped  is located within the first repressor region cited. therefore, this first analysis of the dlk <dig> promoter region allowed us to conclude that the minimal region with transcriptional activity is located between positions - <dig> and + <dig>  and that repressor sequences are located between positions - <dig>  and - <dig> 

we next performed a bioinformatics analysis of dlk <dig> promoter region that showed the absence of a consensus tata box and the existence of a potential initiator sequence , yyanwyy   <cit>  between the bases - <dig> and + <dig> around the tss. a downstream core promoter element , whose consensus sequence is rgwyvt   <cit> , was also identified in the dlk <dig> promoter between bases + <dig> and + <dig> . interestingly, a cpg island was also detected between positions - <dig> and + <dig>  which extends from the putative core promoter to the first intron, including the non-coding first exon . therefore, dlk <dig> appears to be a gene with a tata-less promoter associated to a cpg island and, as it happens with other genes with that type of promoter, it also features the presence of gc-boxes. six gc boxes, potential binding sites for the transcription factor sp <dig>  were detected in the region close to the tss, between positions - <dig> and + <dig> . in the absence of a tata box, sp <dig> appears to be involved in the formation of the pre-initiation complex  and in the transcriptional activation, in conjunction with the inr element  <cit> .

the fact that there were putative sp <dig> binding sites downstream of the dpe consensus sequence made us consider the idea that transcriptional regulatory regions could be located downstream of the tss. to explore this, we cloned into pgl3basic several dna fragments spanning the region located between bases - <dig> and + <dig>  from the start of the core promoter to part of the first intron; those plasmids were transfected into nih3t <dig> cells and their transcriptional activity was analyzed . dna fragment -212/+ <dig>  which contains the full core promoter region , the inr element, the dpe element, and all putative sp <dig> binding sites, caused a significant increase in luciferase activity as compared to fragment -212/+ <dig> . this indicated the presence of additional activating sequences in that region. the transcriptional activity of fragment -212/+ <dig> was very similar to that of fragment -212/+ <dig>  indicating the absence of additional activating sequences in the part of the first intron located between bases + <dig> and + <dig> . taken together, our data indicate that, although the minimal promoter sequence is located in fragment -212/+ <dig>  additional sequences contributing to increase the level of basal transcriptional activity of the dlk <dig> promoter are present in fragment +1/+ <dig>  according to those data, the dlk <dig> core promoter comprises the inr and dpe elements, along with several binding sites for the sp <dig> transcription factor, located between positions -160/- <dig> and +52/+ <dig> 

sp <dig> activates the dlk <dig> promoter
to explore whether sp <dig> regulates dlk <dig> transcription, and which of the six sp <dig> putative binding sites could be involved in that process, we co-transfected into nih3t <dig> cells different dlk <dig> promoter-luciferase constructs containing the potential sp <dig> binding sites, along with a plasmid expressing sp <dig> , or the empty vector  as a control. to preserve the total amount of dna transfected into the cells, in these experiments we used half the amount  of reporter plasmid as compared to previous experiments . our results showed that all promoter fragments containing sp <dig> binding sites, -212/+ <dig>  -375/+ <dig>  -212/+ <dig>  and +1/+ <dig>  induced luciferase activity when sp <dig> was overexpressed ; on the other hand, the fragment -375/+1Δ, which lacks any sp <dig> binding site, showed no responsiveness to sp <dig> 

to analyze the involvement of each gc box in the induction of transcriptional activity, we next mutated each one of them separately in their corresponding fragments, and tested whether the mutations affected the way they responded to sp <dig>  as shown in figure 4b, when we analyzed the activity of the mutant sp <dig> binding sites located upstream of the tss , we could not detect any significant variation in the way the different mutants responded to sp <dig>  however, mutations of the sp <dig> binding sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  located in the +1/+ <dig> fragment, led to a significant reduction of their responses to sp <dig> in all cases . our results demonstrate the existence of functional sp <dig> response elements within the first exon of dlk <dig>  and possibly in its proximal promoter, that might transcriptionally regulate the expression of dlk <dig> 

sp <dig> specifically binds to the dlk <dig> promoter
to study whether sp <dig> directly binds to the dlk <dig> promoter, we next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses  in 3t3-l <dig> cells with the chip-it express kit . we used normal rabbit igg as a negative control, and antibodies against rna-polymerase ii as a positive immunoprecipitation control. we also performed immunoprecipitation with an antibody against sp <dig> . purified dna from the immunoprecipitated samples was used as template for pcr, using a pair of primers specific to dlk <dig> , which amplify the region surrounding the tss . the results  indicated that sp <dig> directly binds to the dlk <dig> promoter region, and suggested that sp <dig> can be directly responsible of the regulation of dlk <dig> expression reported in previous studies.

to further analyze sp <dig> binding to dlk <dig>  we next explored by emsa which of the six gc-boxes were directly bound by that transcription factor. we designed three double-stranded oligonucleotides, containing one, two or three of the six gc boxes , that were radiolabeled and incubated with nuclear protein extracts from nih3t <dig> cells expressing sp <dig>  following electrophoresis and autoradiography, we detected the formation of dna-protein complexes with the three oligonucleotides tested . these complexes appeared to be specific in the case of oligonucleotides sp1-a and sp1-c, since they could be competed out both by a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide, and by a similar excess of a commercial consensus sp <dig> oligonucleotide. in addition, the same commercial oligonucleotide in which the sp <dig> consensus site had been mutated was unable to compete with the labeled oligonucleotides. finally, the addition of a specific antibody against the sp <dig> protein produced a supershift in both cases. we also detected a protein-dna complex with the sp1-b oligonucleotide, but the competition and supershift assays were negative.

as oligonucleotide sp1-c contains three of the six gc-boxes , we synthesized a series of mutated versions of this oligonucleotide; three of them in which each one of the sp <dig> binding sites was individually mutated ; and one in which the three sites were simultaneously mutated . when these oligonucleotides were used as binding competitors to sp <dig> in emsa analyses, we found that only mt was unable to block the formation of the sp1-dna complex . the fact that the single mutations did not abolish the competing capacity of each oligonucleotide indicates that sp <dig> binds at least to two out of the three gc boxes present in the oligonucleotide sp1-c.

our results point to sp <dig> as an important regulator of dlk <dig> transcription, able to bind to two different regions of the dlk <dig> promoter, one located between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  and the other between positions + <dig> and + <dig> 

downregulation of sp <dig> expression by sirna results in direct downregulation of dlk2
to provide additional support about the role of sp <dig> on the regulation of dlk <dig> expression, we carried out two sets of rna interference experiments. we first analyzed the effect of the downregulation of sp <dig> on the transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the six putative sp <dig> binding sites present in dlk <dig> promoter. for that, nih3t <dig> cells were transiently co-transfected either with pgl3basic-212/+ <dig>  with a silencer select sirna specific to sp <dig> , or with the corresponding negative control, along with the sp <dig> expression plasmid, pcmvsport-sp <dig>  or its corresponding empty vector. as shown in figure 6a, transfection with sp <dig> specific sirna resulted in a reduction of both basal activity, and sp <dig> mediated activation of the reporter plasmid, demonstrating the existence of an sp <dig> responsive element in the dlk2promoter.

to fully demonstrate the role of sp <dig> in dlk <dig> regulation, we next performed transient transfections in nih3t <dig> cells, either with the sp <dig> sirna or with its negative control, and analyzed the effects of sp <dig> downregulation on dlk <dig> transcription by rt-qpcr. as shown in figure 6b, the reduction of sp <dig> expression resulted in a 50% reduction in the amount of dlk <dig> mrna, indicating that sp <dig> plays an important role in the regulation of dlk <dig> expression.

discussion
the work presented here adds new elements to understanding the biology of dlk <dig>  providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its expression. the mouse dlk <dig> genomic locus has been constantly revised during the last years, which has led to frequent changes in the assignment of the corresponding predicted transcripts. at present, the sequence of the mouse dlk <dig> locus appears as definite, but the number of dlk <dig> putative transcripts varies among databases. in the refseq database, there were three full-length mrnas associated to dlk <dig>  bc <dig>  bc <dig>  and bc <dig>  in this work, we have identified, in all tissues and cell lines tested, a unique dlk <dig> transcript, only compatible with cdna clone bc <dig>  our directed pcr analyses and the results of the race assays showed that the tss identified for dlk <dig> is only compatible with that transcript . our results also show a  <dig> bp 5' extension of the seemingly truncated bc <dig> clone. a new entry taking into consideration our experimental data has been established in genbank/embl/ddbj databases, with id fm <dig>  as mentioned above, the bc <dig> entry was temporarily eliminated from the databases, and even today it is still defined as a chimeric clone. however, in the variety of mouse tissues and cell lines used for the characterization of dlk <dig> transcripts in this work we have reported the existence of a single major dlk <dig> mrna species consistent with clone bc <dig>  interestingly, we have also detected a minority transcript, yet uncharacterized, that seems to be expressed only in the brain, and that does not correspond to any of de v <dig> transcripts previously described. although we cannot rule out the existence of additional mrna transcripts expressed in other tissues or at different developmental stages, our data show that clone bc <dig>  and its extended version, clone fm <dig>  are clearly non-chimeric mrnas.

analysis of the dlk <dig> promoter transcriptional activity by luciferase assays revealed that the shortest fragment with transcriptional activity is located between positions - <dig> and + <dig>  and that the deletion of  <dig> bp located between positions - <dig> and - <dig> led to the complete abolition of dlk <dig> transcriptional activity . unexpectedly, the largest fragment tested, - <dig> /+ <dig>  showed very low transcriptional activity, apparently due to the presence of inhibitory sequences in the region located between - <dig>  and - <dig> bp, as confirmed by luciferase assays performed with strong sv <dig> promoter constructs. it seems that the dlk <dig> promoter shows low level of basal transcription, due to the mentioned repressive sequences. we have explored the predicted state of the chromatin at the dlk <dig> promoter region, taking advantage of the publically available genomic map of chromatin modifications performed in cells with different degrees of differentiation, focused on the methylation of certain lysine residues of these proteins, such as k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . according to this map, dlk <dig> presents two regions with h <dig> methylation, the first one with h3k27me <dig> methylation , in es cells and in mefs, and the second one with double h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> methylation  in es cells . according to the authors of the map, single methylation at residue k <dig> is associated with an active chromatin state; however, methylation at residue k <dig> is a mark of repressed chromatin. some promoters present simultaneously both h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation, and in most of them the basal transcription is repressed  <cit> . these ambiguous promoters have been associated to genes of complex expression, including cell surface molecules and key transcription factors, during development or morphogenesis. the first h3k27me <dig> region coincides with the repressor region mapped in our luciferase experiments, and could be in part responsible for the basal repressed state of dlk <dig>  a membrane protein involved in morphogenesis, developmental and differentiation processes  <cit> .

bioinformatics analyses showed that dlk <dig> is a tata-less promoter gene, as are about 74% of human genes  <cit> . that analysis also revealed the existence of core promoter consensus elements, such as inr and dpe. those elements are common in tata-less promoters: they are required to trigger transcription in the absence of a tata sequence  <cit> . an important aspect of the dlk <dig> promoter structure is the presence of a cpg island between positions - <dig> and + <dig>  which extends from the putative core promoter to the first intron, including the non-coding first exon. cpg islands are potentially sensitive to dna-methylation, and could participate in gene transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the basal state of cpg islands in the promoters possessing them is non-methylated, although methylation can occur at certain times during development, to achieve specific gene silencing  <cit> . so far, nothing is known about the methylation state of the dlk <dig> cpg island. this issue is, however, of great potential importance for the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of dlk <dig> during development, and along the differentiation processes in which that gene participates, and is currently under study in our laboratory.

when tata-less promoters are associated to cpg islands generally they contain consensus gc-boxes in the region close to the tss that could be recognized by the transcription factor sp <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that, together with the inr element, sp <dig> can regulate the transcription of those genes  <cit> . there are six gc-boxes in the dlk <dig> promoter, located between positions - <dig> and + <dig>  we have shown that the transcription factor sp <dig> could bind to the dlk <dig> promoter in that region, both by chip and by emsa analyses. in addition, our luciferase assays have shown that the activity of the dlk <dig> promoter is modulated by sp <dig>  and that mutation of some of the sp <dig> binding sites abolished sp1-mediated dlk <dig> transactivation. we have also demonstrated that a reduction in the expression level of sp <dig>  using sirna technology, results in a decrease of the transcriptional activity of the dlk <dig> promoter, as well as a reduction in the amount of dlk <dig> mrna. our results indicate, therefore, that sp <dig> is a key regulator of dlk <dig> transcription.

interestingly, during in vitro adipogenic assays in 3t3-l <dig> cells, sp <dig> expression is reduced in response to some of the components of the adipogenic differentiation cocktail, including ibmx, a camp phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. sp <dig> has also been involved in the control of transcription of several genes that are essential for the correct onset of adipogenesis; an ibmx-dependent reduction of sp <dig> expression causes a derepression of the c/ebpαgene, thus promoting adipogenesis  <cit> . other authors have recently reported that the sp1-dependent downregulation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig>  is necessary for adipogenesis  <cit> . on the other hand, unpublished data from our group shows that dlk <dig> is an important factor regulating the early stages of adipogenesis, being a transcriptional target of the crucial transcription factor klf <dig>  dlk <dig> expression is tightly controlled during the first hours of the adipogenic differentiation, showing a peak of expression two hours after the induction with ibmx, and maintaining a low level of expression during the rest of the process. the fact that the expression of both sp <dig> and dlk <dig> are controlled by the same molecule during early adipogenesis, together with the role of sp <dig> in activating the expression of dlk <dig>  raise the interesting possibility that dlk <dig> could be a transcriptional target of sp <dig> during the adipogenesis process. finally, we have recently described that together with dlk <dig>  dlk <dig> acts as a notch signaling regulator  <cit> . the control of dlk <dig> expression, therefore, may be a mechanism with important consequences for the regulation of the numerous differentiation processes in with notch receptors participate. further studies are granted to explore these possibilities.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here the characterization of the mouse dlk <dig> transcript in several preadipocitic and hepatoma cell lines, as well as in adult brain, spleen, heart, liver, and testis. in all the samples the transcript appears as a unique species, with a  <dig> bases 5' extension related to the previously described clone bc <dig>  and it has been entered in genbank with the id . dlk <dig> possesses a tata-less promoter, with the consensus sequences inr and dpe, and located within a cpg island. there are sequences able to repress transcription, located at position - <dig> /- <dig> that may in part be responsible for the repressed basal state of the dlk <dig> promoter. the minimal sequence with transcriptional activity is located between positions - <dig> and + <dig>  the dlk <dig> core promoter contains six gc-boxes between the position - <dig> and + <dig>  consensus sequences for the binding of the transcription factor sp <dig>  we have shown, both by chip and by emsa analyses that sp <dig> binds to the dlk <dig> promoter in that region. additionally, we have demonstrated that the activity of the dlk <dig> promoter is modulated by sp <dig>  and that mutation of some of the sp <dig> binding sites abolished sp1-mediated dlk <dig> transactivation. our results indicate, therefore, that sp <dig> could be a key regulator of dlk <dig> transcription.
