BACKGROUND
the convergence of nanotechnology with nanomedicine has added new hope in the therapeutic and pharmaceutical field. the unique nature of nanoparticles is being exploited by scientists, in hope of developing novel diagnostic and antimicrobial agents  <cit> . silver nanoparticles  are widely used in medicine, physics, material sciences and chemistry  <cit> . however, the rapid progress in nanotechnology was accompanied by insufficient data on biohazard identification. exposure to nanomaterials occurs through inhalation, ingestion, injection for therapeutic purposes and through physical contact at cuts or abraded skin. from the site of deposition, the nanoparticles are translocated to different parts of the body through the circulatory or lymphatic system. in vivo studies showed that exposure to nanoparticles could result in inflammation, oxidative stress, myocardial infarction and thrombosis  <cit> . in addition, a few of the nanoparticles can alter the permeability of blood brain barrier  <cit> . although these concepts are applicable to nanomaterials in general, a detailed study is necessary for each nanoparticle in use.

ag-nps are classified as antimicrobial agents  <cit>  and are widely used in treating wounds, burns and catheter related infections  <cit> . even though silver complexes were used for decorating sweets, as components of dental alloys  <cit>  and antimicrobial agents in ancient times, lack of information regarding the toxicity remained an important issue. a few reports demonstrated the toxicity of silver nitrate on human dermal fibroblasts  <cit>  and on aquatic species  <cit> . we had identified in vivo targets of silver nanoparticle in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . silver nanoparticles were found to be deposited in various organs in zebrafish embryos giving rise to distinct developmental defects. recent reports on ag-np toxicity have identified the mitochondria  <cit>  as primary targets of silver nanoparticles in rat liver cells. moreover, ag-nps were reported to act via reactive oxygen species  production and glutathione depletion in rat liver cells  <cit> . the recent work by skebo and colleagues  <cit>  claimed that ag-nps coated with polysaccharide exhibited less cytotoxicity compared to other ag-nps employed for the study.

ag-nps are believed to alter the membrane structure by attaching to the sulphur containing proteins of the cell membrane thereby damaging the cell membrane of the bacteria  <cit> . recent reports emphasised on the size and shape dependent interactions of ag-nps with bacterial cells, which played a crucial role in their bactericidal properties  <cit> . the occupational hazard associated with the nanoparticle exposure and the molecular mechanisms underlying ag-np toxicity are still unknown. here, we set to investigate the mechanism of ag-np toxicity by employing various techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridisation  to detect the chromosomal abnormalities and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  for monitoring change in gene expression patterns occurred due to nanoparticle treatment. the uptake and exocytosis rates of nanoparticles were estimated. also, the ca2+ transients in the nanoparticle treated cells were monitored and the propagation of ag-np signals was identified. a model is proposed based on the data which might explain the mechanism of ag-np toxicity.

RESULTS
cellular uptake and exocytosis of nanoparticles
attempts to identify the uptake routes of ag-np led to the conclusion that ag-np were taken up mainly through endocytosis. clathrin dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis played major role in ag-np uptake. untreated cells showed no detectable levels of silver. the cells incubated at low temperature had much reduced concentration of silver  as compared to 37°c incubated cells, which implies that endocytosis is the major pathway for ag-np uptake . nevertheless, inhibition of clathrin pits formation did not result in a complete drop in endocytosis which indicates that ag-np endocytosis can occur in the absence of clathrin pits. when cellular uptake through macropinocytosis was aborted, a significant drop in ag-np uptake was observed, suggesting the active involvement of the pathway. inhibition of caveoli pits did not affect ag-np uptake. exocytosis studies showed a gradual increase in silver concentration in cell culture supernatants together with a drop in nanoparticle concentration in cell homogenates. the nanoparticle concentration in culture medium showed a time and concentration dependant increase . the process of exocytosis was compared with the endocytosis by calculating the percentage of drop of total endocytosed silver to that of exocytosed with time . the exocytosis followed a concentration dependant increase over time, where ~ 66% of endocytosed nanoparticles where exocytosed by  <dig> hours compared to an exocytosis of ~ 10% at  <dig> hours. a long incubation period of  <dig> hours was taken to expel 66% of the particles endocytosed in  <dig> hours, implying a slow exocytosis rate than endocytosis. a significant amount of endocytosed nanoparticles  was still retained by the cells.

recovery and colony formation
normal fibroblasts treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml of ag-np recovered completely from the proliferation arrest  whereas cells treated with  <dig> μg/ml of ag-np recovered by the end of one month recovery period. the cell cycle analysis performed using the recovered cells showed no evidence of cell cycle arrest . untreated cells  and cells treated with  <dig> μg/ml of ag-np formed colonies  while none of the cells treated with higher concentration of ag-np formed colonies till the end of incubation period . an increase in floating cells with time was observed at higher concentrations. the morphology of untreated cells appeared normal  whereas those treated with ag-np showed incomplete filopodia . the morphology deteriorated more with time  giving rise to cells with no protoplasmic extensions, suggesting onset of cell death . however, the nuclear morphology was well preserved suggesting no nuclear fragmentation .

up regulation of stress response genes
in a recent study, we have observed a dose and time dependent ros production in imr- <dig> and u <dig> cells following exposure to ag-np  <cit> . additionally, kim et al.  <cit> , using antioxidant enzymes in their study, reported that ag-np cytotoxicity is primarily the result of oxidative stress and is independent of the toxicity of ag+ ions. therefore, stress response genes were selected in our study for further analysis. real time rt-pcr confirmed an up regulation of metallothionein   and hemeoxygenase- <dig>  expression in ag-np treated samples .

intracellular distribution of ag-np
electron micrographs revealed that ag-np has a uniform intracellular distribution. endosomes containing ag-np were seen near the cell membrane , suggesting nanoparticles enter the cells via endocytosis. the cytoplasm of the treated cells showed numerous endosomes with engulfed nanoparticles, autophagic vacuoles filled with structures resembling mitochondria and electron dense contents of unknown origin. nanoparticles were observed in the nucleus of the treated cells . numerous exocytic vesicles were also observed inside the cells .

chromosomal aberrations in ag-np treated cells
ag-np treated cells were thoroughly analysed for chromosome aberrations. no significant abnormalities were observed in chromosomes of untreated fibroblasts . cells treated with high concentration of nanoparticles  did not yield enough metaphases which suggested that only a few cells were entering in to mitosis. however, fibroblasts treated with the lower dose  showed an increased percentage  of aberrations characterised by the presence of acentric and centric fragments . similarly, cancer cells treated with same concentration of ag-np showed increased chromosomal aberrations compared to control. untreated cancer cells  showed aberrations in the form of centric fragments  and dicentric chromosomes , whereas ag-np treated cancer cells showed many acentric  and centric fragments  and dicentric chromosomes . the percentage of aberrant cells was 10% and 20% for treated normal and cancer cells respectively . untreated normal cells showed no aberrant cells whereas untreated cancer cells showed 16% aberrant cells. the aberrations observed in both the cell lines are represented in 5g. the number of dicentric chromosomes were comparable in control and treated groups.

fifty metaphases were analysed per concentration. higher concentrations of ag-np did not yield sufficient number of metaphases for the analysis. percentage of aberrant cells was expressed as number of cells which showed aberrations/number of metaphases analysed ×  <dig> 

calcium fluctuations in ag-np treatment
a typical bell shaped curve was obtained with normal cells treated with ag-np for  <dig> hours. on the other hand, the kinetic study showed a drop in ca2+ concentration upon addition of ag-np . however, the fluorescence in wells treated with  <dig> μg/ml of ag-np increased gradually with time. data obtained from normal cells, which were treated with ag-np for  <dig> hours showed a drop in ca2+ concentration. a gradual increase in ca2+ concentration occurred after  <dig> hours for ag-np concentrations up to  <dig> μg/ml, above which the values fell below the control sample. however, in normal cells the ca2+ concentration stabilized by  <dig> hours giving a bell shaped curve . the ca2+ concentration at  <dig> μg/ml of ag-np was comparable to the controls in fibroblasts. in contrast, cancer cells showed a sharp drop in intracellular ca2+ ion concentration except at  <dig> hours . cancer cells at  <dig> hours showed elevated levels of ca2+ in all concentrations employed. calcium levels were fluctuated further by  <dig> hours.

morphological changes in cells
scanning electron microscopy analysis  of untreated fibroblasts revealed their normal morphology and spreading patterns . adjacent cells were connected to each other through short and slender extensions of the parent cells. no blebbing was observed in control cells. on the other hand, the ag-np treated fibroblasts appeared more spherical, with minimum filopodia . similar pattern was observed for cancer cells. untreated cancer cells appeared normal . the spreading patterns of the ag-np treated cancer cells were affected . a few cells showed cell membrane blebbing and decreased ruffle formation. real time rt-pcr analysis of filamin mrna showed down regulation of filamin . cancer cells showed much lower levels of filamin compared to the normal cells.

discussion
mechanism of uptake of ag-nps is an unidentified area, which could shed light to the mechanisms of toxicity as well as potential therapeutic application of nanoparticles. in the present study, we have observed that ag-np uptake occurs mainly through endocytosis where clathrin mediated process and macropinocytosis were involved. this observation corroborates with the electron micrographs which showed uncoated endosomes of size ~  <dig> nm. the survival of cells from nanoparticle mediated damage depends on their ability to expel the nanoparticles. previous reports have emphasised the role of exocytosis process in expelling gold nanoparticles from the cells to avoid critical loss of function  <cit> . hence, exocytosis rates of ag-nps were monitored for a better understanding of the cellular retention and expulsion of nanoparticles. such approaches might have implications on long term deposition of nanoparticles in cells and chronic toxicity. exclusion of ag-np followed a slow and time dependant pattern. though the cells were able to remove nanoparticles efficiently, the nanoparticle concentrations in cells were well within detectable limits of ag concentration even after  <dig> hours of recovery, which suggests active nanoparticle retention and chances of a continuous and prolonged ag-np mediated stress.

metallothioneins are considered as essential biomarkers in metal-induced toxicity  <cit>  facilitating metal detoxification and protection from free radicals  <cit> . recent reports on heavy metal toxicity in javanese medaka had shown that mt upregulation occurs in silver mediated toxicity  <cit> . ho- <dig> is an ros sensor and a cryoprotective agent possessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. ho- <dig> break down heme to antioxidant biliverdin, carbon monoxide and iron under stress conditions  <cit> . rahman et al. studied upregulation of oxidative stress response genes  in mouse brain following ag-np exposure  <cit> . our results substantiate existing animal studies data where upregulation of ho- <dig> mrna signifies oxidative stress. due to the antioxidant and metal detoxifying properties of ho- <dig> and mt, upregulation of the genes might defend the cells against the stress induced by ag-np.

electron micrographs have indicated endocytosis of ag-np in to the cells and its presence in the nucleus. the exact outcome due to the nuclear deposition of ag-np is unknown; however, it is expected to have lethal effects in dna synthesis, dna damage, chromosomal morphology and segregation. the deposition of metal particles inside the nucleus could affect the dna and cell division. genotoxic studies of titanium dioxide  nanoparticles revealed dose dependant dna damage, chromosomal aberrations and errors in chromosome segregation  <cit>  and formation of sister chromatic exchanges  <cit> . treatment with ag-np induced the production of micronuclei   <cit> , a marker of chromosome damage. mroz et al.  <cit>  speculated that nanoparticles and reactive oxidative species induce dna damage, activating p <dig> and proteins related to dna repair, mimicking irradiation related carcinogenesis. the observed genotoxic response, in our study, could be a consequence of oxidative damage to dna  <cit> .

our experiments on ag-np treated cells demonstrate the occurrence of calcium transients. there are substantial evidences linking oxidative stress to ca2+ transients  <cit>  which can increase ca2+ by permeability changes of mitochondria. ca2+ ions are indispensable for cellular functions viz. cellular transport through actin dynamics and mitosis. although ca2+ signalling occurs rapidly, a time dependant study was adopted based on the fact that nanoparticle diffusion and subsequent binding to specific receptors on cellular organelles could result in direct ca2+ transients or activation through other pathways, which will take time to initialize. even though the binding of ag-np to plasma membrane receptors is rapid, the rates of diffusion or endocytosis and subsequent binding with intracellular targets are relatively slow. the possibilities of continuous diffusion of nanoparticles and sustained activation of ca2+ channels are high throughout the incubation period. moutin et al  <cit>  provided evidence that ag+ ions act on the same site as ca2+ ions, regulating the release of ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum. also, higher concentration of ag+ ion inhibited ca2+ release from the intracellular stores in a similar way as higher concentrations of ca2+ ions, giving a bell shaped curve  <cit> . ag-np could release ag+ ions through surface oxidation  <cit> , which could trigger ca2+ fluctuations in a similar way.

disruption of calcium homeostasis plays a major role in pathological and toxicological conditions and is an early sign of cell injury. calcium ions have the potential to activate catabolic enzymes like phospholipase, proteases and endonuclease that further augment the toxicity  <cit> . repeated calcium influx and efflux in mitochondria could result in mitochondrial membrane damage, resulting in ros production and inhibition of atp synthesis  <cit> . this report links the oxidative stress, ca2+ and atp depletion occurred in ag-np treated cells. moreover, ca2+ overload in mitochondria could release apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, endonuclease g and other apoptosis inducing factors to the cytosol to initiate apoptosis  <cit> . it was observed that the rise in concentration of ca2+ ions occurred within  <dig> hours. hence, it is possible that the mitochondria mediated ca2+ ions homeostasis occurred during the later stages of incubation period resulting in a delayed induction of apoptosis. it is known that an early sign of ca2+ homeostasis disruption is indicated by blebbing of plasma membrane which is a consequence of cytoskeletal injury  <cit> . sem investigations to study the cytoskeletal injury revealed altered spreading patterns which may be linked to ca2+ fluctuations. yet, the difference in response between cancer cells and normal cells towards ca2+ response and cell recovery adds on to the complexity of the mechanism.

cytoskeleton injury in most instances blocks chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. similar patterns of cytoskeletal injury were reported in melanoma cells lacking filamin, a dimeric actin cross-linking protein  <cit> . the absence of filamin in cells produces unstable psuedopods  around the cells thereby inhibiting their spreading  <cit> . morphological deteriorations in cells exposed to ag-np are possibly due to interference with structure and functions of actin cytoskeleton, which might be one of the reasons for inhibition of cell division. the cytoskeleton damage could result from calcium fluctuations and gene dysregulation. a possible mechanism of action of ag-np which links the discussed parameters is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the ag-np and ag+ ions which gets released from the nanoparticles are believed to be involved in cell signalling cascades with the activation of ca2+ release that further activates catabolic enzymes and damage mitochondrial membranes. the outcome of the signalling cascades inhibits cell division.

CONCLUSIONS
this work concludes that ag-nps have multiple cellular targets that vary among cell types. we have identified that the major route of nanoparticle uptake is through clathrin dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis. also, exocytosis occurs in a time dependant manner in cancer cells. exposure of ag-nps resulted in chromosomal abnormalities, inhibition of proliferation, observed as failure to form colonies, and absence of recovery selectively in cancer cells, which add new hopes for preventing cancer cell metastasis. a uniform intracellular distribution of ag-np was observed in the treated cells. moreover, the upregulation of cryoprotective genes like ho- <dig> and mt-1f showed that the cellular defense mechanisms are still active in normal cells.
