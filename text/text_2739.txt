BACKGROUND
a cis-sense antisense gene pair  comprises a gene pair in which the individual genes map to opposite strands on the same dna locus and are, therefore, transcribed in opposite directions. the corresponding pairs of cis-antisense transcripts are mrnas that are at least partially complementary to each other. cis-antisense mrnas that are naturally transcribed from a sagp are known as naturally occurring sense-antisense  rnas.

studies have shown that changes in the transcription of sagps could be implicated in pathological processes such as some cancers and neurological diseases  <cit> . for example, it was shown experimentally in leukemia cells that genes bal <dig> and bba, which form a sagp, are bi-directionally transcribed and concordantly expressed due to inf-gamma induction and that their products can directly interact at the protein level  <cit> . previously we reported that  <dig> high-confidence sagps pairs are concordantly regulated in human breast cancer tissues  <cit> . among these, two pairs  are constitutively co-regulated in breast tumors of different genetic grades , while the co-expression of the cr590216/eap <dig> sagp is observed specifically in g <dig> genetic grade.

in mammalian genomes, sagps can be organized in more complex sense-antisense gene architectures  in which at least one gene shares loci with two or more antisense partners  <cit> . many dozens of csagas can be found in the human genome -  <cit> ; therefore, it is an intriguing speculation that not only sagps, but also csagas, as integrated modules, may play important roles in human diseases, including cancer. in this regard, the study of the co-regulatory profiles of genes in the same csaga and, possibly, between different csagas or other transcriptional modules would shed new light on the complex nature of the entire transcriptome.

there are many oncogenes on chromosome  <dig>  although the localization of these genes is not uniform. for example, according to cancer genetics web http://www.cancer-genetics.org, the oncogenes taf2n, nf <dig> and thra are located on 17q <dig> -q <dig>  erbb <dig> , a well-known oncogene, is located on 17q <dig>  the gene birc <dig> on 17q <dig> , which encodes the apoptosis inhibitor survivin, co-amplifies with erbb <dig> and correlates with high histological grade and a poor prognosis in breast cancer when overexpressed  <cit> . many other genes located close to erbb <dig> on 17q <dig> could be over-expressed or/and amplified and are known or suspected to play a role in carcinogenesis, specifically, breast carcinogenesis. previous studies have demonstrated that the negative effect on the prognosis of breast cancer attributed to erbb <dig> amplification could, in fact, be due to co-amplification of the region adjacent to erbb <dig>  <cit> . the erbb <dig> gene and its neighbour genes could be amplified and over-expressed in 25% of invasive breast carcinomas  <cit> . in general, erbb <dig> amplification and over-expression confers an unfavourable prognosis, although its significance is less than that of the traditional prognostic factors of stage and grade. it also seems that the prognosis and response to therapy varies considerably within the spectrum of erbb2-amplified breast carcinomas, indicating that they are biologically heterogeneous  <cit> .

csagas and their association with human cancers in the regions outside of the erbb <dig> amplicon core region in 17q <dig>  <cit>  have not been studied. it is possible that a high diversity of breast cancer cell subtypes could be associated with active chromatin regions on 17q that are different from the erbb <dig> amplicon region. we focused on a csaga located on 17q <dig>  composed of five genes and including the convergent sagp tnfaip1/poldip <dig>  we assume that novel csagas important in breast cancer development could be found in highly unstable regions of the genome and that these complex architectures could play significant roles in transcription control, resulting in cancer phenotypes and impacting patient survival.

methods
patients, tumor specimens, cell lines and microarray data
clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients and tumor samples from two independent cohorts  have been published previously  <cit> . the stockholm cohort comprised ks =  <dig> patients with breast cancer, who were operated on in the karolinska hospital from  <dig> january  <dig> to  <dig> december  <dig> and identified in the stockholm-gotland breast cancer registry  <cit> . the uppsala cohort involved ku =  <dig> patients representing approximately 60% of all breast cancers resections in uppsala county, sweden, from  <dig> january  <dig> to  <dig> december  <dig>  information on patients' disease-free survival  times/events and the expression patterns of approximately  <dig>  gene transcripts  in primary breast tumors was obtained from the national center for biotechnology information  gene expression omnibus  . the microarray intensities were mas <dig>  calibrated and the probe set signal intensities log-transformed and scaled by adjusting the mean signal to a target value of log <dig>  for association studies of dna copy number and gene expression we utilized single nucleotide polymorphism  copy number microarray data for  <dig> breast cancer cell lines  <cit>   as well as gene expression profiling of  <dig> human breast cancer cell lines downloaded from the geo: gse <dig> 

correlation analysis
our primary goal is to identify whether the set of genes composing the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga forms a significant cluster. first, we estimate pearson correlation coefficients among these genes in the two large cohorts and subsequently test whether their matrices are significant at level α = 1%. using pearson correlation coefficient requires that the data are normally distributed. to show that our data satisfy this assumption, we run kolmogorov-smirnov test for normality with lilliefor's p value correction. additional file  <dig> contains supplementary tables s1a-d shows the results for each grade in each cohort. evidently, our data can be thought to come from a gaussian distribution.

then, we derive a correlation matrix of the form:  

where r1p denotes the pearson correlation coefficient between affymetrix probesets  <dig> and p, estimated from the microarray expression data, and p is the total number of probes in the prospective cluster.

to test the significance of the r matrix, we used a bootstrap version of bartlett's statistical test  <cit> . the bootstrap bartlett test evaluates the significance of the hypothesis h0: rp×p = ip×p, where rp×p is the p × p correlation matrix and ip×p is the corresponding p × p identity matrix. under the null hypothesis, there is no significant correlation among these probes, whereas rejection of h <dig> at α = 1% is an indication of a cluster. for the p genes of the correlation matrix one needs to compute the statistic:  

where n is the sample size , p is the number of variables  and |r| is the determinant of the sample correlation matrix. this quantity is distributed approximately as χ <dig> with 1/ <dig> p degrees of freedom. to test the significance of the statistic, we draw b =  <dig>  samples of p neighbouring genes  at random from the set of  <dig>  genes and estimate bartlett's t-test, tb, for each of the b =  <dig>  draws. the corresponding bootstrap p value is estimated as:  

where tb denotes the bootstrap test statistic of the bth draw. similar bootstrap approaches have been discussed in  <cit> .

comparison of correlation matrices
we would like to show that the genes in the r matrix form a significant, tight cluster that cannot be re-produced in the neighbourhood. for our analysis we use box's m test  <cit> , which evaluates the significance of the hypothesis h0: rp×p =  where rp×p is as before and  is a q × q correlation matrix of the neighbouring genes . note that r and r* should have equal dimension but the correlation coefficients ra,b  of r and  of r* can be estimated from unequal sample sizes v <dig> and v <dig> and used to estimate box m statistic as:  

|s1| is the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of our prospective gene cluster , |s2| is the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of the neighbouring group of genes  and |spool| is the pooled sample variance/covariance matrix estimated as:  

box  <cit>  gave χ <dig> and f approximations for the distribution of m . notice that in our case v <dig> = v <dig> but the dimensions of r and r* differ. to compare r and r* we form all possible  matrices and compare each one with rp×p using box m test. then we average over the estimated p values. it is possible that our approach introduces some bias in the comparison. however, as we will see later, the difference between the two compared matrices is large enough to safely conclude for their statistical difference.

survival analysis based on genes and gene pair expression patterns
this analysis involves testing whether the prospective gene cluster contains survival significant genes and gene pairs. as survival significant we consider the genes whose expression levels are significantly correlated with survival times/events. the approach that we follow is called data driven grouping and has been extensively discussed in  <cit> . here we briefly describe the idea of the method.

we assume a microarray experiment with i =  <dig>   <dig> ..., p genes, whose log-transformed intensities are measured for k =  <dig>   <dig> ..., k patients. associated with each patient are continuous clinical outcome data , tk, defined as the time interval from surgery until the first recurrence  or the last date of follow-up), and a nominal  clinical event ek . each patient is assigned to low- or high- risk groups according to:  

where ci denotes the cut-off of the ith gene's intensity level. motakis et al.  <cit>  showed how to estimate this cut-off from the data by maximizing the distance of the kaplan-meier survival curves of the two patients groups. this algorithm is called one-dimensional data-driven grouping . the clinical outcomes/events are subsequently fitted to the patients' groups by the cox proportional hazard regression model  <cit> :  

where hik is the hazard function and αi = log hi <dig> represents the unspecified log-baseline hazard function; β is the  <dig> × p regression parameter vector; and tk is patient survival time. to assess the ability of each gene to discriminate the patients into two distinct genetic classes, the wald p value of the βi coefficient of the cox proportional hazard regression model  <cit>  is estimated by using the univariate cox partial likelihood function, estimated for each gene i as:  

where r = {j: tj ≥ tk} is the risk set at time tk and ek is the clinical event at time tk. the actual fitting of the cox model is conducted by the survival package in r http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html. the genes with the significant βi wald p values are assumed to have better group discrimination ability and are thus called "highly survival-significant genes". these genes are selected for further confirmatory analysis or for inclusion in a prospective gene signature set.

the proposed dichotomization of the patients into two groups and the subsequent fit on the cox proportional hazards model is a strategy that has been followed in the past  to identify clinical groups of patients. our data-driven method is an improvement of the mean-based approach  <cit>  as showed in  <cit> . data-driven grouping estimates the optimal partition  of a single gene's expression level by maximizing the separation of the survival curves related to the high- and low- risk of the disease behaviour. in this sense it does not rely on predefined cut-offs  and, more importantly, it is able to identify several survival significant genes that cannot possibly be found by other methods. our technique has the potential to be a powerful tool for classification, prediction and prognosis of cancer and other complex diseases. extensive discussion and evaluation of our method can be found in  <cit> .

a similar approach is applied to identify synergistic survival-significant gene pairs using the two-dimensional data-driven grouping method of motakis et al.  <cit> . briefly, for a given gene pair i, j with individual cut-offs  ci and cj, i ≠ j, we may classify the k patients by seven possible two-group designs.

for each design and estimate the seven wald p values for  . provided that the sample sizes of the respective groups are sufficiently large and the proportionality assumption of the cox model is satisfied , the best grouping scheme among the five "synergistic"  and the two "independent"  designs is that with the smallest p- value. we perform multiple testing corrections later when the best designs and p values have been collected for each gene pair. at that stage we will identify the truly prognostic significant genes by minimizing the number of false positives. the procedure we will apply is the false discovery rate  <cit> . extensive discussion is provided at the paragraph 'survival analysis of sfgm genes and their closest neighbours in breast cancer patients'.

the correlation and survival analyses were conducted in r http://cran.r-project.org/ using software developed by our group. all our programs are available upon request.

RESULTS
identification of the co-expressed tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sense antisense gene pairs
using the high-confidence affymetrix chip u <dig> a&b probesets presented in the apma database  <cit> , http://apma.bii.a-star.edu.sg/, we selected  <dig> sagps located on chromosome  <dig> with reliable refseq support  for each member of each pair. each of the genes in these sagps was supported by at least  <dig> affymetrix chip u <dig> a&b probesets. we focused on chromosome  <dig> because many regions of that chromosome are actively involved in recurrent amplifications during breast cancer development . using mrna expression data from the uppsala and stockholm cohorts, we calculated pearson correlations for each pair and identified high-confidence correlated pairs of probesets  representing twelve sagps. among these positively- and highly-correlated sagps, two convergent sa gene pairs  attracted our attention  because tnfaip <dig> and ift <dig> also have a common sa overlapping region. thus, these two sagps were in fact the parts of the same complex csaga. our further work was focused on the detailed characterization of this csaga.

poldip <dig>  encodes a protein that interacts with the dna polymerase delta p <dig> subunit and with proliferating cell nuclear antigen   <cit> . some transcripts of this gene overlap in a tail-to-tail orientation with the gene for tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein  <dig> . the genes of this pair form a convergent  gene orientation topology, share a 376-nucleotide region of their 3'-untranslated regions and are located on human chromosome cytoband 17q <dig> . it has been reported that this gene can be induced by tnf-alpha  <cit> . moreover, the tnfaip <dig> protein can also directly interact with the pcna protein. the rat tnfaip <dig> stimulates polymerase delta activity in vitro in a pcna-dependent way  <cit> . thus, transcription of poldip <dig> and tnfaip <dig> could be under common control and the products of these genes could be involved in the same pathways.

identification of tnfaip1/poldip <dig> structural-functional gene module
we identified two sagps  located close to each other on 17q <dig> . these sagps demonstrated reproducible and significant co-expression pattern in  <dig> independent cohorts  of breast cancer patients. when the genes composing the sagps were analyzed as a pair in survival analysis, their co-expression turned out to be survival significant in both cohorts. for tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sagp, the p value  for stockholm was  <dig> e- <dig>  and the corresponding values for uppsala was  <dig> e- <dig> . for ift20/tmem <dig> sagp, the p value  for stockholm was  <dig> e- <dig>  and the corresponding values for uppsala was  <dig> e- <dig> . the plots of patients grouping and kaplan-meier survival curves are shown in 'materials and methods' section.

next, we produced correlation matrices of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> and ift20/tmem <dig> sagps with seven more neighbouring genes, including the one closest gene  located centromeric to ift20/tmem <dig> sagp and six closest genes  located telomeric to tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sagp. according to the ucsc genomic browser , the most distant centromeric gene, ppy <dig>  is located at a distance not exceeding  <dig> kb from tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sagp. the most distant of the telomeric genes, foxn <dig>  is located at a distance of  <dig> kb . affymetrix u133a&b probesets 214283_at , 229182_at as well as 233531_at and 234060_at  were excluded from our analysis due unclear support by the well annotated and reliable refseq gene database. genes  in the matrix were placed in the same order as they are located on 17q <dig>  in the human genome. analyzing the correlation matrices of these  <dig> genes, we discovered that  <dig> of them are structurally organized as complex sense antisense gene architecture  . these genes are tmem <dig>  ift <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  poldip <dig> and tmem <dig>  figure 3a, b shows their strong mutual correlation pattern in breast cancer patients in both breast cancer cohorts. the expression levels of each of these five genes in different grades of breast cancer in both cohorts were much higher compared to the  <dig> centromeric and telomeric neighbours in the chosen genomic window . also, significant differences in gene expression levels were observed for tmem <dig> and poldip <dig> in different grades of breast cancer in both cohorts . we performed heat map analysis using tree view  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit>  - which showed a clear overexpression cluster of the five-gene module compared to its centromeric and telomeric neighbours in both breast cancer cohorts .

the structural backbone of this tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga is composed of three cpg rich regions representing putative gene promoters , as well as two intergenic convergent sa overlaps  with refseq support  and one divergent sa overlap with ucsc support  .

based on its structural and expressional integrity, we have termed the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga a tnfaip1/poldip <dig> structural - functional gene module . for the remaining six genes in the chosen window we use the term 'neighbouring' genes for the convenience of description.

next, using bartlett's test  <cit>  and box's m test  <cit> , we addressed the following questions: first, whether the correlation matrices for the five genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm  as well as the correlation matrices for the six 'neighbouring' genes  are statistically significant compared with randomly chosen matrices derived from genes close to each other in the whole genome ; and, second, whether sfgm matrices are significantly different from ng matrices. as discussed before our second task involved comparing two matrices of unequal dimension. for this reason, we found all possible 6-genes signatures composed by ng matrices and compared each respective matrix with the sfgm matrix. then, we averaged the test p values and reported our results in table  <dig> 

 <dig> -- p values were calculated using bartlett's bootstrap test.  <dig> -- averaged p values were calculated using box's m test . u -- uppsala cohort; s -- stockholm cohort.

bartlett test in uppsala cohort showed that the tested correlation matrices were highly significant in all four different grades or using all patients data at significance level α = 1%. in the stockholm cohort, g <dig> and g <dig> subgroups were highly significant at the same significant level. g3-like subgroup was close to the border line and only g1-like was not significant . all ng matrices in both cohorts produced insignificant bartlett p values and are not further considered as candidates for the members of tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm.

next, we applied box's m test to the comparison of two correlation matrices at α = 1%. the test revealed highly significant differences in almost all pairs of sfgm matrices and ng matrices . taken together, the statistical analysis clearly supports the existence of the five-gene sfgm. on the other hand, it strongly excludes the six other 'neighbouring' genes as members of this sfgm. we also utilized box's m test to determine if there are any differences among sfgm matrices for each cancer grade in both cohorts. we observed that the sfgm showed a significant strengthening of its co-regulatory profile  in the following group pairs: g <dig> and g3-like ; g1-like and g <dig> ; g <dig> and g <dig> ; g1-like and g3-like .

we suggest three possible mechanisms for the observed co-regulatory pattern of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm: an amplification mechanism , - if the modules are located in an amplified region on 17q involved in the process of breast cancer development; a chromatin remodeling/activation mechanism ; and a transcription activation mechanism .

survival analysis of sfgm genes and their closest neighbours in breast cancer patients
we applied our survival analysis algorithm for the genes of sfgm and ng matrices. four members  of tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm are significant at α = 5% according to wald p values, whereas no neighbouring genes satisfied this criterion. to minimize type i error rate  we applied false discovery rate  correction to the p values using the classic fdr of benjamini and hochberg  <cit> , extended for positive dependent data  <cit> . typically, positive dependence exists if the variance covariance matrix of the six probes we study contains only positive entries, which is true in our case. at significance level α = 5%, the uppsala and stockholm cohort fdr corrected p values were estimated as  =  <dig> e -  <dig> and  =  <dig> e -  <dig>  respectively. table  <dig> indicates the wald and fdr significant probes of our set. notice that after fdr correction our set still contains highly significant genes in both cohorts. it is important that all four genes belong to the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and none belongs to the group including the six "neighbour genes". interestingly, tmem <dig> was survival significant in both cohorts, and it was shown previously to play a role in primary and metastatic colorectal cancers  <cit> . we also applied survival analysis and 2d data-driven grouping to identify survival significant probe pairs among the probes of our prospective cluster. first, we estimated the wald p values and then used the fdr correction as before. the fdr corrected p values in uppsala and stockholm cohorts were  =  <dig> e -  <dig> and  =  <dig> e -  <dig>  we kept the survival significant gene pairs which were common in the two cohorts. table  <dig> shows our results .

bold italics indicates gene pairs where the p values for a gene pair are at least ten times lower than that for either of the individual gene's of the pair for both the uppsala and stockholm cohorts. u, uppsala cohort; s, stockholm cohort.

among the seven unique genes that compose the eleven significant gene pairs  we observed all five genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and two  belonging to the 'neighbour's' gene group. three of the eleven selected gene pairs  demonstrated an effect of synergy, with the wald p values for this more than ten times lower than the p values calculated for the individual genes of the pairs. - for example, the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> , tnfaip1/tmem <dig> and sarm1/tmem <dig>  gene pairs revealed a synergistic effect with regard to survival in the stockholm cohort. figures  <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> show clearly that synergy improved patients grouping.

the gene pair tnfaip1/poldip <dig> is a convergent sagp in the middle of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm. therefore, our survival analysis of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and its "neighbouring genes" has revealed individual survival significant genes as well as significant gene pairs suggesting that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm is important for breast cancer prognosis.

expression of gene members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> structural-functional gene module strongly correlates with dna copy number
previous studies of her2-amplified tumors have demonstrated that the smallest region of amplification  involving her <dig> spans  <dig> kb and contains a number of genes in addition to her <dig> that have elevated levels of expression  <cit>  <cit> . a comprehensive genomic study of her <dig>  amplicon by arriola et al.  <cit>  revealed  <dig> additional smallest regions of amplification  scattered throughout the genome. in our study of the data from  <cit>  we found that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm is located inside of one of these  <dig> sras on 17q <dig>  . we call this the 17q <dig>  sra to distinguish it from the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm. correspondingly, the smallest region of amplification that includes the erbb <dig> core region  as well as many other neighboring genes we call the 17q <dig> sra   <cit> ).

in order to elucidate whether the mrna expression levels of members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm correlate with the dna copy number of the corresponding region of the 17q <dig>  sra, we estimated kendall-tau correlation coefficients between dna copy number values for selected snps and microarray expression data for the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm as well as their neighbors. for this purpose we used high-resolution snp microarray profiling together with microarray gene expression data  for  <dig> breast cancer cell lines for which both sources were available  <cit>  . correlation matrix analysis with these  <dig> cell lines  confirmed the clear co-regulatory pattern of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm, which was primarily identified in two breast cancer cohorts.

for the analysis of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm we selected four snp markers covering the genomic region between  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>  kb on the 17q <dig>  sra; the region of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and neighboring genes covers the region between  <dig>   <dig>  kb  and  <dig>   <dig>  kb . the results of the correlation analysis are presented in table  <dig> that shows significant correlations of expression with dna copy number for all genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm. hence, amplification of the 17q <dig>  sra can be an important driver of expression for the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm in breast cancer.

only kendal-tau correlation coefficients with α = 1% are shown. bold font indicates genes shown to be involved in the co-regulatory pattern of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and erbb <dig> amplicon. *affymetrix u133a&b probesets, **ppp1r1b and tcap - genes of the erbb <dig> amplicon that have been excluded previously from the erbb <dig> cr due to their weak expression and nonsignificant correlation with dna copy number  <cit> .

expression of gene-members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm strongly correlates with expression of gene-members of the erbb <dig> core region
the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm is located on 17q <dig>  centromeric to the region of the erbb <dig> locus on the 17q <dig> cytoband. the erbb <dig> locus has been extensively studied and has been proposed to be one of the most important loci in breast cancer  <cit> . it is widely accepted, that the most common mechanism for erbb <dig> activation in breast cancer is gene amplification  <cit> . it is also well established that the amplified dna segment  in breast cancer is often rather large and typically covers many genes  <cit> .

in our analysis we found that the genes composing the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm are located in a much wider region of the 17q <dig>  sra   <cit> . according to arriola et al.  <cit> , this region  is associated with her <dig> - and her2/top2a-amplified breast tumors. in another study it was suggested that predominantly luminal and her <dig>  cancers display a characteristic 'firestorm/amplifier' genomic pattern  <cit> , that is, when coamplification of many regions in the genome is observed as a common phenomenon.

previous studies on the erbb <dig> amplicon have utilized several different approaches. one of these was based on detection of a correlation between dna copy number and mrna expression  <cit> . this approach was successfully used for characterization of the erbb <dig> amplicon and determination of its smallest minimal region of amplification, the core region of the erbb <dig> amplicon  which is a  <dig> kb long  <cit> . the analysis showed that the erbb <dig> cr includes the following genes: erbb <dig>  grb <dig>  stard <dig>  pp1r1b, pnmt, neurod <dig>  tcap, znfn1a <dig>  perld <dig> and c17orf <dig>  real-time rt-pcr confirmed the correlation between amplification and expression levels  <cit>  for genes comprising the erbb <dig> cr. finally, the erbb <dig> cr was suggested to include the genes erbb <dig>  grb <dig>  stard <dig>  pnmt, perld <dig> and c17orf <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the borders of the erbb <dig> cr could be defined by the stard <dig> gene centromerically and the grb <dig> gene telomerically.

in our study, we performed dna copy number analysis of the erbb <dig> cr together with several flanking genes; for this purpose we used seven snp markers covering the region from  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> kb on the 17q <dig> sra  <cit> . for the affymetrix microarray expression analysis the data for the genes of the erbb <dig> cr as well as their closest neighbor genes  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> kb ) were utilized. correlation analysis of the expression profile with dna copy number was performed exactly as for the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm   <cit> . the results of the correlation analysis of the erbb <dig> cr are presented in table  <dig>  as expected, the expression-copy number correlation pattern for the genes of the erbb <dig> cr in our analysis demonstrated good consistency with the data of kauraniemi et al.  <cit> .

another approach originally applied to budding yeast  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit>  included searching  for groups of neighboring genes that showed correlated expression profiles. the same idea was utilized for the human genome  <cit> . the transcription correlation score was calculated for each gene in the genome. the score was calculated as the sum of the spearman rank order correlation values in the tumor samples between the rna levels of the gene of interest and the rna levels of each of the physically nearest 2n genes . specifically, our analysis of supplementary material for the erbb <dig> amplicon in  <cit>  showed that this second approach confirmed the data on the basic members of the erbb <dig> amplicon and, therefore, showed good consistency with the first approach  <cit> .

in our correlation analysis we applied a similar idea as in  <cit>  but used a different computational apparatus  and performed more detailed characterization of genomic regions of interest. in order to validate the reliability of our approach, originally applied to the characterization of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm, we performed a similar correlation analysis of matrices for the region of the erbb <dig> amplicon which has been well-characterized previously.

we produced correlation matrices that included  <dig> validated genes of the erbb <dig> cr  and  <dig> neighboring genes based on data from the uppsala and stockholm cohorts. genes in a matrix were placed one by one in the order of their chromosome localization . interestingly, we reproducibly  observed a clear co-regulatory pattern  of a transcriptional module that included not only the genes that were validated as members of the erbb <dig> cr , but also - the genes tcap and ppp1r1b . the neighboring genes neurod <dig>  ikzf <dig>  and zpbp <dig> were 'dropped' from the module due to a lack of significant correlations with any member of the module and matrix.

independently, for the  <dig> breast cancer cell lines for which both expression and dna copy number data were available  <cit>   the correlation matrix for the erbb <dig> cr and its neighboring genes was very similar  to those produced for the breast cancer cohorts .

previously, kauraniemi et al.  <cit>  excluded tcap and ppp1r1b as well as neurod <dig> and ikzf <dig>  from the erbb <dig> cr based on their weak or absent expression and lack of correlation with copy number. therefore, the results of our erbb <dig> cr matrix correlation analysis demonstrate good consistency with the data of kauraniemi et al.  <cit> , who used a different approach. similarly, in the study of reyal et al.  <cit>  only genes neurod <dig>  ppp1r1b, ikzf <dig> and zpbp were absent from the list of genes for which the transcription correlation score was above the threshold for the transcription correlation map of  <dig> invasive ductal carcinomas.

our correlation analysis of the erbb <dig> cr and neighboring genes in the chosen genomic window is not only in a good agreement with previous studies based on different approaches, but also adds new information that could be methodologically important. in this context, we suggest that the correlation matrix analysis we have applied in the present work could be a new independent tool for studying of amplified and/or co-regulated genomic regions in cancer.

due to the previously documented fact of co-amplification of broad genomic regions of the 17q <dig>  and 17q <dig> sras  <cit>  at the dna level, we proposed that expression of the genes composing the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm  and genes composing the erbb <dig> cr  could also be correlated at the level of transcription. we produced correlation tables that included both the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and the erbb <dig> cr and their neighboring genes in the uppsala and stockholm breast cancer cohorts. we found that the mrna expression levels of all members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm were significantly correlated with those of at least two or more members of the erbb <dig> cr . erbb <dig> and c17orf <dig> were significantly correlated with almost all  members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm in both cohorts.

similarly, in  <dig> breast cancer cell lines , the expression of the erbb <dig> gene was significantly correlated with the expression of all the  <dig> members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm, although the total number of observed significant correlations was less than for the breast cancer patients .

therefore, the expression profiles of the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and the erbb <dig> cr are correlated in breast cancer and this fact could probably be explained by co-amplification of their genomic regions. however, alternative mechanisms could be considered, including similar epigenetic modifications of chromatin as well as common upstream regulatory transcription factors.

genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm are co-regulated not only through changes in dna copy number but also by transcription activation and chromatin remodelling
additional custom tracks in the ucsc browser for stat <dig> binding in hela s <dig> cells  <cit>  clearly demonstrate the presence of two functional stat <dig> binding sites in the ift20/tnfaip <dig> bidirectional promoter. moreover, upon stimulation by interferon-gamma, the binding signal intensity for stat <dig> increased at least seven-fold . recently, liu at al.  <cit>  reported that another transcription factor, sp <dig>  is directly  associated with the tnfaip <dig> promoter in hela cells. therefore, the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm is also potentially regulated by stat <dig> and sp <dig> as well as stimulated by interferon-gamma in breast cancer cells. finally, direct and independent evidence of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm activation in breast cancer cells comes from the custom track for rna polymerase ii binding in the mcf <dig> breast cancer cell line   <cit> .

results of our additional experiment are presented in figure 5b. we produced the correlation matrix of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm based not on the gene expression values , but on their ratios to dna copy number values . expression data originally extracted from  <cit>  as well as data normalized to dna copy number are presented in additional file  <dig>  because the values for all four snp markers utilized in the analysis of the  <dig> breast cancer cell lines were identical , we were able to perform normalization using values for any of them. the produced matrix revealed the typical co-regulatory pattern again, although with fewer mutual correlations.

therefore, we have clearly demonstrated that not only recurrent amplification, but also chromatin remodeling and/or transcription activation is important for the establishment and maintenance of the co-regulatory pattern of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm. moreover, we suggest that the co-regulatory pattern of the five member genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm could originally be established as the result of epigenetic modifications and/or transcriptional activation rather than by recurrent amplification in breast cancer cells. theoretically, the latter mechanism could serve as an 'accelerator' of an already established preexisting co-regulatory pattern. in this context, the role of the csaga in the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm deserves special attention and comprehensive experimental study.

discussion
a method for the statistical identification of co-regulated genes organized in complex genome architectures
in the present study, we have developed a new computational method for the statistical identification of co-regulated genes organized in complex genome architectures including more than one sagp. our approach is based on:  concordant analysis and selection of expressed sa genes;  identification of the boundaries of a genomic region encompassing genes with similar co-expression patterns;  validation of the expression pattern using independent patient cohorts;  evaluation of the clinical significance of expressed genes that belong to the identified genome region; and  identification of the synergy of the genes in the context of disease aggressiveness and disease relapse.

tnfaip1/poldip <dig> is an essential structural-functional module in the human genome
we analyzed the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga on 17q <dig>  in two breast cancer cohorts. the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga is composed of five genes: tmem <dig>  ift <dig>  tnfaip <dig>  poldip <dig> and tmem <dig>  the gene pairs tmem97/ift <dig>  tnfaip1/poldip <dig> and ift20/tnfaip <dig> produce sense-antisense transcripts; the gene pairs ift20/tnfaip <dig> and poldip2/tmem <dig> share corresponding bi-directional promoter regions. this complex genomic region exhibits a well-organized transcription apparatus:  <dig> cpg islands; two experimentally validated  and several putative transcription factor binding sites in canonical promoter regions - gata <dig>  taxcreb, crebp <dig>  creb and srebp <dig> transfac  <dig> ); strong signals for rna polymerase ii binding ; and probable open chromatin regions  and h3k27met3) . the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga region could produce a large diversity of alternative splice variants of the genes it encompasses . our analysis of correlation matrices revealed a phenomenon whereby genes structurally organized in the genome in the csaga demonstrate a reproducible co-regulatory pattern in breast cancer cells . we termed the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm.

concordant regulation in the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga
we did not observe any significant negative correlations  in the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm in agreement with several previous reports of frequent concordant regulation of sense-antisense pairs  <cit> .

correlation analysis of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm in four grades of breast cancer  revealed a strengthening of the correlations between the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm. survival analysis of individual genes as well as of gene pairs from the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm and its neighbors was also performed. only the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm proved to be survival significant in at least one of the two cohorts analyzed . among  <dig> genes analyzed,  <dig> survival-significant gene pairs have been identified and all the genes of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm were involved in these pairs. each of the  <dig> pairs contained at least  <dig> gene from the sfgm. moreover, three top level survival-significant gene pairs demonstrated a synergistic effect with regard to the prognosis of breast cancer disease relapse when compared with individual genes . this finding indicates the importance of this module in breast cancer progression and prognosis.

protein interaction sub-network
our analysis of the literature on the members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm confirmed a previous suggestion regarding its functional integrity and its possible importance in cancers.

liu et al.  <cit>  reported on the physical interaction of the poldip <dig> protein with the p <dig> subunit of dna polymerase delta and pcna. pcna has been called the 'ringmaster of the genome', because it has been shown to actively participate in a number of the molecular pathways responsible for the life and death of the mammalian cell  <cit> . it marker to evaluate cell proliferation and prognosis when combined with other breast cancer markers, such as estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and erbb <dig>  <cit> .

tnfaip <dig> belongs to kctd family of the proteins containing t <dig> domain capable of regulation of the voltage-gated potassium channels. it was shown that rat tnfaip <dig> is highly homologous to polymerase delta-interacting protein  as well as to kctd <dig> and all three proteins can directly interact with pcna. in the rat, pdip <dig>  tnfaip <dig> and kctd <dig> can stimulate dna polymerase delta activity in vitro in pcna-dependent way  <cit> . of note, down regulation of kctd <dig> can inhibit cell proliferation in carcinoma a <dig> cells  <cit> . direct indications of involvement of tnfaip <dig> in apoptosis and carcinogenesis include the following facts: - ck2-mediated phosphorylation of tnfaip <dig> in hela cells affects its sub-cellular localization and interaction with pcna  <cit> ; rhob induces apoptosis by direct interaction with tnfaip <dig> in hela cells  <cit> .

tmem <dig> cytoplasmic expression was shown to be positively correlated to expression of pcna; this gene is considered a prognostic factor in the metastasis of colorectal cancer  <cit> . another important fact is that in uv-irradiated human cells, pcna foci demonstrate striking colocalization with phosphorylated breast cancer susceptibility protein brca <dig> <cit> . both pcna and brca <dig> are required for postreplication repair  <cit> . therefore, at least three members of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> module could be functionally associated in the same pcna complex.

two interesting recent publications support the idea about the involvement of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> module in the cell cycle and cell proliferation: poldip <dig> was shown to be associated with spindle organization and aberrant chromosome segregation  <cit> ; and tissue-specific deletion of floxed ift <dig> in the mouse kidney causes mis-orientation of the mitotic spindle in collecting duct cells, prevents cilia formation and promotes rapid postnatal cystic expansion of the kidney  <cit> .

interesting pleiotropic effects of poldip <dig> also include interaction with cell-cell adhesion receptor ceacam <dig>  <cit>  and involvement in transcription and metabolism of mitochondrial dna  <cit> .

co-regulatory pattern of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm with the erbb <dig> amplicon
it is important to note that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> module is located outside of the well-known erbb <dig> amplicon on 17q <dig>  over-representation of which in the genome is often associated with the occurrence of the erbb2-positive breast cancer subtype. in the present work, we demonstrated reproducible correlations of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm with the 'core region' of the erbb <dig> amplicon . this finding is in good agreement with data from a recent report on her <dig>  co-amplified regions in breast cancer patients and cell lines  <cit> . in fact the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm is located inside the smallest region of recurrent amplification on 17q <dig>  and expression of its members strongly correlates with dna copy number . significant correlations between members of both modules could be explained, at least partially, by a co-amplification mechanism. nevertheless, the correlation of the expression profiles of these modules would not imply a direct association with similar breast cancer subtype.

it is well established that overexpression of the erbb <dig> amplicon is predominantly associated with the erbb <dig> breast cancer subtype  <cit> . preliminary data obtained in our pilot study  indicate that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm demonstrates stronger correlation pattern not with the erbb <dig> breast cancer subtype but rather with luminal a and b subtypes.

therefore, we suggest that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm could be used potentially as a new integrative indicator in breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring. this issue requires comprehensive study and will be addressed in future publications.

taken together, our analysis suggests that the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> sfgm is composed of genes that are not only closely organized in a complex genomic architecture and co-regulated at the transcription level, but also could be involved in essential common biochemical pathways as well as protein-protein and protein-dna interactions forming molecular complexes important for many cellular processes, including cell division, proliferation, apoptosis, intracellular transport and cell binding. such diverse structural and functional properties suggest the biological importance and clinical significance of the tnfaip1/poldip <dig> csaga.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that the methods of computational identification of novel structural and functional gene modules and the grouping of clinically heterogeneous  patients based on the expression patterns of genes of these modules could provide broad perspectives for the development of computational systems biology strategies for understanding the genetics and pathobiology of many complex genetic diseases.

due to concordant regulation of the genes in such modules, one could target just the antisense transcript, resulting in reduction of sense mrna transcripts, or also the adjacent genes of the module, thereby achieving additive and even synergistic reduction of expression of a specific group of neighboring genes  <cit> . pharmacological strategies aimed at either stimulation or suppression of expression of a specific group of genes that are influenced by natural sa regulation could also be developed. a discovery of biologically meaningful and clinically significant csagas, instead of the conventional finding of 'gene signatures', might be more promising in the context of the appropriate translation of microarray analyses into clinical practice and the identification of new drug development strategies.
