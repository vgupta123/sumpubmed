BACKGROUND
transmissible gastroenteritis virus  is the etiological agent of transmissible gastroenteritis , and it can cause viral enteritis and severe diarrhea with high morbidity in pigs of all ages, as well as high mortality in suckling piglets  <cit> . it occurs at swine-raising farms and results in significant economic losses  <cit> .

tgev is an enveloped virus belonging to the coronaviridae  family and the nidovirales order. it possesses a large  <dig> -kb single-stranded, positive-sense rna genome. about two-thirds of the entire rna comprises open reading frames  1a and 1b, encoding rna replicase. the 3′ one-third of the genome comprises genes encoding structural and non-structural proteins  <cit> . the genes of tgev are arranged in the order of 5′-rep-s-3a-3b-e-m-n-orf7-3′.

the spike  gene of tgev encodes an approximately  <dig> -amino acid protein, with a molecular weight ranging from 128–160 kda without glycosylation and 150–200 kda after glycosylation. functionally, the s glycoprotein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies, and it is also related to host cell tropism  <cit> , interaction with its cellular receptor, pathogenicity, fusion, and hemagglutination activity  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a small hydrophobic protein  during viral replication. the intracellular localization of the hp suggests that it may play an important role in the process of membrane integrity during viral replication and/or virion assembly  <cit> .

in this report, we isolated a tgev-hx strain of tgev from the feces of piglets in heilongjiang province in china. to better understand the molecular characteristics of this isolate, its complete genome sequence was obtained, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the complete orf sequence of the s gene. the results provide molecular and phylogenetic information for a chinese isolate of tgev, which may assist in elucidating the genetic evolution of tgev in china.

extraction of viral rna, reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction  and complete genome sequencing
viral rna was extracted from pk- <dig> cells infected with tgev-hx using the trizol reagent . cdna was generated by adding 4 μl of rna to the following components: 4 μl of 5× reverse transcription buffer, 4 μl of dntps mixture ,  <dig>  μl of rnase inhibitor, 5 μl of random primer ,  <dig>  μl  of amv reverse transcriptase, and 2 μl of sterile water. the components were gently mixed in an eppendorf tube and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, then transferred to a water incubator at 42°c for 1 h prior to storage at −20°c . the resulting cdna was amplified by pcr using la taq dna polymerase . ten pairs of primers were designed based on conserved regions of tgev strain h <dig> . pcrs were conducted in a total of volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of 10× buffer, 3 μl of dntps mixture , 8 μl of cdna, 1 μl of forward primer , 1 μl of reverse primer ,  <dig> u of la taq polymerase , and 31 μl of sterile water. the cycling parameters for the pcr included 94°c for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°c for 1 min, 50°c for 1 min and 72°c for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. two primers  were employed to confirm the 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genome by rapid amplification of cdna ends  using the race cdna amplification kit . the pcr products were run on agarose gels, and correctly sized amplicons were observed. then, the pcr products were purified using the axygen gel extraction kit  and cloned into pmd18-t . three to five independent clones of each tgev amplicon were sequenced. the dna was sequenced using an abi 3730xl sanger-based genetic analyzer .

RESULTS
virus culture and electron microscopy analysis
the pcr results confirmed that one of five samples was tgev-positive, designated tgev-hx; the other four samples were tgev-negative and all five samples were pedv-negative . after three passages, cytopathic effects  were found in the pk- <dig> cells, as evidenced by the cells rounding up and enlarging, the formation of syncytia, and the detachment of cells into the medium . the median tissue culture infective dose  of tgev-hx  was measured using the reed-muench method. when observed by electron microscopy, the virus displayed a circular shape, and the surface projections were petal-shaped, with a diameter ranging from  <dig> to 150 nm, which is similar in size to known tgevs .figure  <dig>

complete genome sequence of the tgev-hx strain
the full-length genome sequence of the tgev-hx strain was deduced by combining the sequences of  <dig> overlapping cdna fragments. the genome sequence of the tgev-hx strain was  <dig>  nucleotides  long, including the poly a tail. the 5′ portion of the genome contained a 314-nt non-translated region , and orf1a  and orf1b , encoding the viral rna-dependent rna replicase. the structural proteins s, e, m, and n were found to be encoded by orfs s , e , m , and n , respectively. the three non-structural protein-coding genes were orf3a , orf3b , and orf <dig> . the 5′ ntr included a potential short aug-initiated orf , beginning within a kozak sequences . the 3′ end of the genome contained a 273-nt untranslated sequence and a poly  tail. upstream from the poly  tail, there was a 5′-ggaagagc-3′ octameric sequence .

the non-structural genes
the replicase genes were composed of orf1a and orf1b, which contained a 43-nt common region  and a “slippery site” . the orf1a gene of tgev-hx was predicted to encode a protein of  <dig>  amino acids , while orf1b was predicted to encode a  <dig> -aa protein. nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that there were no deletions or insertions in the orf1ab region of the miller  <dig> and purdue tgev strains.

orf3a and orf3b of tgev-hx were predicted to encode 72-aa and 244-aa proteins, respectively. no deletions or insertions were found in the orf3a or orf3b genes of tgev-hx. the orf <dig> gene of tgev-hx was predicted to encode a 78-aa protein, which contained the common pp1c-binding motif 5′-rviflvi-3′  <cit> . no deletions or insertions were found in orf <dig> of tgev-hx.

the structural genes
the nucleotide sequence of the s gene of tgev-hx was  <dig>  nt in length, encoding a predicted protein of  <dig>  aa. a 6-nt deletion was found in the s gene at nt  <dig> – <dig>  of the tgev-hx, sc-y, and wh- <dig> strains, which caused the s protein to be two amino acids shorter than those of the purdue, miller  <dig>  ts, h <dig> and h <dig> strains . amino acid  <dig> of the purdue, miller  <dig>  and ts strains was s, while in the tgev-hx, sc-y, wh- <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> strains, it was a . amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  of tgev-hx were identical to those of strains sc-y and wh- <dig>  but different from those of strains ts, h <dig>  and h <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
as an enteropathogenic coronavirus, tgev is the major cause of viral enteritis and diarrhea in neonatal pigs, resulting in significant economic losses. currently, tgev occurs sporadically in parts of europe, north america, and asia. the fact that wild and domestic carnivores  seroconvert to tgev indicates that they are potential subclinical carriers of tgev.  <cit> . in summation, tgev has become a new challenge for the pig farming industry. as few tgev genome sequences have been published, little is known about tgev evolution. the results of this study will provide necessary information for further understanding the evolution of tgev.

a complete sequence analysis indicated that no deletions or insertions were found in the 5′- and 3′- ntr regions of tgev-hx, suggesting that its replication and transcription mechanism was not changed. a 6-nt  deletion in the s gene was found in the tgev-hx, sc-y, and wh- <dig> strains, but not in the purdue, miller  <dig>  ts, h <dig>  and h <dig> strains. it was showed that this deletion was observed in the attenuated purdue strains pur46-c <dig> and pur46-mad, and it was considered to play a role in viral attenuation  <cit> . competition studies using monoclonal antibodies led to the prediction of at least four main antigenic sites, designated a, b, c, and d  <cit> . the a and b sites  have been mapped, and they serve as the major antigenic sites, including the binding site for the viruses host receptor, aminopeptidase n . single amino acid changes in the s protein can greatly impact its antigenicity  <cit> . the serine to alanine mutation at amino acid  <dig> may have a significant influence in receptor binding or neutralizing antibody interactions  <cit> . five chinese strains, tgev-hx, sc-y, wh- <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  ha and alanine residue at this position, while the purdue, miller  <dig>  and ts strains had a serine residue, which suggested that the antigenicity of the s protein of the five chinese strains may be changed. furthermore, amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  of tgev-hx were identical to those of strains sc-y and wh- <dig>  but different from those of strains ts, h <dig>  and h <dig> 

the nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology analysis of the structural proteins and non-structural proteins indicated that tgev-hx was highly similar to the wh- <dig>  sc-y, and purdue strains, and had a lower sequence similarity to the miller  <dig>  ts, h <dig>  and h <dig> strains. the phylogenetic analysis showed that tgev-hx was closely related to the sc-y, wh- <dig>  and purdue strains, which belonged to the purdue cluster, while the miller  <dig>  ts, h <dig>  and h <dig> strains belonged to the miller cluster, which was consistent with the results of the homology comparison. the data obtained in this study indicated that hx had different ancestors than the early chinese strain h <dig>  and it might be derived from the same ancestor as the sc-y, wh- <dig>  and purdue strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides the complete genome sequence of a tgev-hx strain from china. by comparing the s gene and protein with those of other tgev strains, we have gained a further understanding of the genetic structure, diversity, and evolution of the tgev-hx strain. our next work is to evaluate the characteristics of mutations in the s gene using a reverse genetic approach in animal experiments.
