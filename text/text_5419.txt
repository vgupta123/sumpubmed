BACKGROUND
the flows of carbon and nutrients in the coastal ocean are disproportionately high in comparison with its surface area because of the massive inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land. large amounts of matter and energy are exchanged between the coastal ocean and the open ocean across continental slopes and the coastal ocean represents one of the most biogeochemically active areas of the biosphere . the production, degradation, export and burial of organic matter in coastal waters are in general much higher than in the open ocean .

the metabolic status of an ecosystem is quantified by the net ecosystem production  that corresponds to the difference between gross primary production  and ecosystem respiration  in both the pelagic and benthic compartments. this will determine if an ecosystem exports organic carbon to adjacent systems  or if an ecosystem requires external organic carbon inputs to sustain its ecosystem metabolism . however, the ecosystem metabolic status of the coastal ocean as net autotrophic or net heterotrophic has been the subject of a long lived debate  <cit> . one of the reasons for this debate is the lack of data for resolving the temporal variability of carbon cycling in the highly dynamic coastal ecosystems, and for adequately describing the diversity and spatial heterogeneity of these ecosystems  <cit> . a recent exhaustive literature review of ecosystem metabolic estimates in european coastal waters did not reach an unambiguous conclusion on their trophic status, although these are among the most thoroughly studied sites in the world  <cit> .

reliable estimates of the ecosystem metabolic status are hampered by the conceptual problems associated with 14c estimation of primary production , the strong spatial heterogeneity within an ecosystem , and the high temporal variability  which cannot be easily measured with classical incubation based approaches. gazeau et al.  <cit>  reviewed the advantages and caveats of several methods to estimate nep, and recommended the use of integrative mass balance approaches. a commonly applied integrative mass balance approach is the land-ocean interaction in the coastal zone  method based on the budget of dissolved inorganic phosphorus   <cit> . in turbid environments such as inner and outer estuaries, the loicz dip budgets can provide highly unrealistic nep estimates  due to complex abiotic processes of desorption/adsorption from/on suspended matter .

here, we report seasonal and inter-annual variations of nep in the scheldt estuarine plume  estimated from a dissolved inorganic carbon  mass balance approach. this approach has previously provided robust estimates compared to incubation techniques in several coastal environments such as the randers fjord  <cit> , the scheldt inner estuary  <cit>  and the bay of palma  <cit> .

RESULTS
a wide range of techniques are used to estimate the metabolic status of coastal ecosystems, and each relies on one or several assumptions, and covers different spatial and temporal scales as reviewed by gazeau et al.  <cit> . integrative methods based on mass balance approaches of relevant biogeochemical variables  have been recommended for estimation of metabolic performances in dynamic and complex coastal environments  <cit> . nep can be established from a box model approach, by balancing the dic inputs and outputs . however, this method requires the knowledge of water flows that are typically highly variable in coastal environments, and tends to introduce a large uncertainty that is difficult to quantify. a more simple approach relies on the temporal variation of dic, whereby:

 nep=−dic2−dic1Δt⋅d−fco22+fco <dig> 

where dic <dig> and dic <dig> are dic values from  <dig> consecutive cruises, fco <dig> and fco <dig> are the air-sea co <dig> fluxes  from  <dig> consecutive cruises, Δt is the time interval between  <dig> consecutive cruises, and d is the depth of the mixed layer depth.

such an approach is suited for permanently well-mixed systems such as the belgian coastal zone , as knowledge of the mixed layer depth is not required. this method relies on the assumption that the production and degradation of organic matter, and air-sea co <dig> exchange are the main drivers of co <dig> dynamics . such an assumption holds true in the bcz based on current understanding of co <dig> dynamics in this region  <cit> . the major caveat of the method is the assumption that the net advective input/output of co <dig> is constant between two steps of the computation. this source of uncertainty can be assumed minimal in the present case, because for time steps of the computations lower than the water residence time, the invariance of co <dig> advective inputs/outputs can be assumed constant. the average time step of the computations was  <dig> d for an average water residence time of  <dig> d  <cit> .

a pco <dig> data-set of spatial surveys that covers the whole bcz and satisfactorily captures the seasonal and spatial variability was obtained in  <dig>  <cit> . this data-set consists of  <dig> cruises that cover the whole bcz ; data in the scheldt estuarine plume were extracted based on salinity   <cit> , interpolated and averaged. this allows calculation of mean values for the whole scheldt plume taking into account the spatial variability, which is not included in a fixed station approach. this allows verification that the nep values computed from the fixed reference station are representative of the whole scheldt plume. nep values computed from the pco <dig> survey data-set obtained in  <dig>  are consistent in timing and amplitude with those computed from the fixed reference station data-set . on an annual scale, the nep value computed from the pco <dig> survey data-set obtained in  <dig> is - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mol m- <dig> yr- <dig> in agreement with the value computed from the fixed reference station data-set for the same year .

fortnightly fresh water discharge data were provided by the ministerie van de vlaamse gemeenschap afdeling waterbouwkundig laboratorium en hydrologisch onderzoek. fdin and fptot were computed from average nutrient concentrations from january and december of the previous year from the netherlands institute of ecology, centre for estuarine and marine ecology database and average q from january and december of the previous year. winter-time din and po42- concentrations were obtained from the management unit of the north sea mathematical models monitoring data-base for december of the previous year at salinity  <dig>  the error on the nep estimates was evaluated by propagating an error on pco <dig> of ±  <dig> μatm on the dic and air-sea co <dig> flux computations.

on an annual scale the scheldt river plume behaved as a net heterotrophic system in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but behaved as a net autotrophic system in  <dig> . using a simple organic matter input/output budget, borges and frankignoulle  <cit>  showed previously that the annual emission of co <dig> to the atmosphere is only partly due to the input of co <dig> from the scheldt inner estuary and that net heterotrophy of the scheldt estuarine plume is also important. the net heterotrophy of the scheldt river plume must be sustained by external inputs of organic carbon that could originate from the belgian coast and/or from the scheldt inner estuary. based on the input of organic matter from the scheldt inner estuary reported by soetaert and herman  <cit>  and a scheldt plume surface area ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> km <dig>  <cit> , we computed a potential organic matter degradation ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol m- <dig> yr- <dig>  wollast  <cit>  provides a higher estimate of the input of organic matter from the scheldt inner estuary that can sustain a potential organic matter degradation ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol m- <dig> yr- <dig>  finally, wollast  <cit>  estimated the input of organic carbon from the belgian coast that can sustain a potential organic matter degradation ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mol m- <dig> yr- <dig>  the potential degradation of these inputs of allochtonous organic matter from the scheldt inner estuary and the belgian coast are of the same order of magnitude as the annual nep values we computed .

the much stronger springtime nep observed in  <dig> compared to the other years is consistent with the remote sensed chlorophyll-a concentration from medium resolution imaging spectrometer  and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer  sensors showing that the peak springtime chlorophyll-a concentration was higher in  <dig> than in  <dig> . it is known that the quality of satellite chlorophyll-a data may be suspect in coastal regions because of masking of phytoplankton absorption by absorption from coloured dissolved organic matter and/or non algal particles. for the region considered here such effects give a detection limit of about 3– <dig> μg l- <dig> for chlorophyll-a concentration for the sea-viewing wide field-of-view  and modis sensors, and possibly a lower limit for meris. this is seen here as a background  concentration at the level of this detection limit. however, the high phytoplankton biomass in spring are detected every year quite coherently by all three sensors, despite different atmospheric correction, overpass time and chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms, giving confidence in the satellite detection of these blooms. seawifs data suggest that peak springtime chlorophyll-a concentration was also higher in  <dig> compared to  <dig> .

the much stronger springtime nep observed in  <dig> and annual net autotrophy observed in  <dig> compared to the other years could be due to a combination of two processes. wintertime freshwater discharge was stronger in  <dig> than in the other years . we used the average value of freshwater discharge in january and in december of the previous year, since the freshwater residence time in the scheldt inner estuary ranges between  <dig> and  <dig> d  <cit> . hence, the freshwater discharges during these months are those that can be assumed relevant for the productive season  in terms of nutrient inputs from the scheldt inner estuary. we hypothesize that in  <dig> there was a stronger input of nutrients compared to the other years, while the input of organic matter was similar to other years. in the scheldt inner estuary, the input of nutrients from diffuse sources are dependent on freshwater discharge, while organic matter comes mainly from point sources independently of freshwater discharge. this would lead to a stronger gpp in  <dig> from the additional nutrient inputs, while allochtonous organic carbon inputs would sustain a similar level of heterotrophy as in the other years. we roughly evaluated the flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen  and of total phosphorous  from the scheldt river to the scheldt estuarine plume . in the bcz, phaeocystis is overwhelming more important than diatoms in terms of phytoplanktonic biomass and gpp , hence the computation of nutrient fluxes was not extended to silicate. fdin values in  <dig> were higher than in  <dig> and  <dig>  while fptot values in  <dig> were higher than in  <dig> and  <dig> but similar to those of  <dig>  in the scheldt estuarine plume, primary production during the spring phytoplankton bloom is strongly limited by ptot rather than by din  <cit> . hence the higher fptot values in  <dig> could explain the higher nep values during spring  <dig> compared to  <dig> and  <dig>  this is confirmed by the winter-time nutrient concentrations at salinity  <dig> in the bcz: winter-time din concentrations were higher in  <dig> than in  <dig>   <dig> and 2004; winter-time po42- concentrations were higher in  <dig> than in  <dig> . also, incoming photosynthetically active radiation  was more favourable in  <dig> during the productive months , and could also explain the marked autotrophy associated to the phytoplankton bloom in  <dig>  despite the fact that the scheldt river plume was net autotrophic in  <dig>  it still acted as a net source of co <dig> to the atmosphere . this confirms that a fraction of this co <dig> emission is sustained by the inputs of co <dig> from the scheldt inner estuary  <cit> . this fraction is expected to increase with increasing freshwater discharge.

the stronger annual heterotrophy in  <dig> than in  <dig> and  <dig> could be due to a transient accumulation of part of the excess organic matter produced in  <dig>  since fptot and winter-time po42- concentrations were actually higher in  <dig> than in  <dig>  the water residence time in the bcz is highly variable but can be as long as  <dig> d  <cit>  and is assumed to be on average  <dig> d  <cit> . hence, we hypothesize that part of the non-steady accumulation of organic matter from  <dig> to  <dig> occurred in the sediments. sedimentation of organic matter is important in the bcz, representing about 20% of annual gpp  <cit> , and gives bottom sediments that are exceptionally rich in organic carbon compared to the rest of the north sea  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present work highlights the potential of using pco <dig> data to derive detailed seasonal estimates of nep in highly dynamic coastal environments, and to determine potential inter-annual variability of nep due to natural climatic oscillations or due to changes in anthropogenic impacts. on a longer term, such an approach should also allow estimation of decadal changes in nep that could be used as an indication of the effectiveness of nutrient control policies for reducing eutrophication of coastal waters.
