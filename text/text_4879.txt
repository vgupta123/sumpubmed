BACKGROUND
one important event during the evolution of angiosperms is the emergence of flower bilateral symmetry, i.e. zygomorphy, a key innovation associated with important adaptive radiations  <cit> . several zygomorphic clades have independently evolved successfully from actinomorphic ancestors in angiosperms, including lamiales sensu lato that includes a major genetic model organism snapdragon   <cit> .

in a.majus, cycloidea  and dichotoma  are essential for the development of dorsoventral asymmetry in flowers due to their dorsal identity function, i.e. controlling the fate of the dorsal floral organs in the second and third whorls  <cit> . cyc promotes cell expansion in the dorsal petals, while it arrests the growth of the dorsal stamen to become a staminode  <cit> . meanwhile, dich activity affects the internal asymmetry of the dorsal petals  <cit> . the ability of cyc to arrest the dorsal stamen depends on its negative effect on expression of cell-cycle genes, such as cyclin d3b  <cit> . cyc and dich encode proteins within the ece-cyc <dig> clade  in the tcp family of transcription factors with tcp domain related to cell proliferation  <cit> . in legumes, distantly related to a. majus, several cyc homologues, such as ljcyc <dig> in lotus and pscyc <dig> in pea, also have the function in establishing dorsal identity in legume flowers  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, a model eudicot species with ancestrally actinomorphic flowers, and its close relative iberis amara, cyc homologues, tcp <dig> and iatcp <dig> genes are characteristic of dorsal identity function, in which iatcp <dig> dorsal-specific expression represses the two dorsal petal development in iberis amara  <cit> . recent studies in the sunflower family  show that cyc-like genes, i.e. ray <dig>  ray <dig> in senecio and ghcyc <dig> in gerbera, have played a key role in the establishment and evolution of the capitulate inflorescence  <cit> . therefore, it is suggested that cyc-like tcp genes have been recruited multiple times for a role of dorsal identity and its modifications in establishing zygomorphy in core eudicots  <cit> . even though the genetic control for the floral dorsoventral asymmetry has been intensively studied in model systems, it is still a great challenge to explain how modifications of development led to the transformation among different types of zygomorphy and the morphological diversification of zygomorphy in angiosperms, especially in lamiales s.l., a major clade of predominantly zygomorphically flowered angiosperms.

zygomorphy is believed to be ancestral in lamiales s.l.  <cit> . most zygomorphic groups in lamiales s.l. have a pentamerous perianth with four stamens plus a dorsal staminode and two carpels as in a.majus. however, there is a great variation in morphology and number of corolla lobes and stamens  <cit> . the dorsal staminode can be completely lost as in rehmannia and veronica   <cit>  and the two lateral stamens may become aborted instead of one dorsal staminode as in mohavea  and chirita   <cit> . in some cases, the two ventral stamens may become staminodes rather than the lateral stamens and the dorsal one, such as in opithandra and epithema   <cit> . in extreme cases, each flower may have only a single stamen as in hippuris   <cit> . in mohavea, a close relative of a. majus, there is a derived floral morphology with abortion of both the dorsal and lateral stamens unlike the flowers of a.majus with abortion of only the dorsal stamen  <cit> . the derived floral morphology of mohavea is correlated with the expression changes of mccyc/mcdich via cyc/dich, i.e. expansion from the dorsal to both the dorsal and lateral stamens  <cit> . a similar correlation of expanded expression of cyc-like genes with abortion of both the dorsal and lateral stamens is also observed in chirita   <cit> . however, we are still not clear about the abortion of the ventral stamens that has been involved in the evolutionary shifts of stamen number during the morphological diversification of zygomorphy in lamiales s.l.  <cit> .

in addition, in the backpetals mutant in a.majus, the ectopic expression of cyc in the lateral and ventral positions results in a dorsalized corolla. however, it seems likely that the androecial development is not affected by the ectopic expression of cyc because the two lateral and two ventral stamens are still fertile  <cit> . in the actinomorphic flower of legume cadia, no legcyc1b mrna is detected in stamens  <cit> . it is hard to determine whether legcyc1b or other cyc homologues in legumes have a role in controlling androecial development from data to date  <cit> . ray <dig> in senecio and ghcyc <dig> in gerbera  mainly promote the growth of the ligule  in ray florets and are excluded from the dorsal rudimentary petals  <cit> . in veronica and gratiola , some of cyc-like genes have dorsal-specific expressions while some have lost this feature, but their expressions do not correlate with ventral stamen arrest  <cit> . therefore, expression data correlated with the ventral stamen abortion have not been reported yet for members of the ece-cyc <dig> clade. it is uncertain whether abortion of the ventral stamens is related to cyc-like gene activities or to the effect of an unknown analogous counterpart of cyc-like genes, such as members of ece-cyc <dig> clade or other factors  <cit> .

the family gesneriaceae is sister to the remainder of lamiales s.l.  <cit>  and has diverse forms of zygomorphy relating to the floral organ differentiation early in the order  <cit> . in gesneriaceae, opithandra exhibits a peculiar floral morphology, where only the two lateral stamens are fertile and both the dorsal and ventral stamens are aborted in the third whorl . phylogenetic analyses suggest that the floral morphology of opithandra is likely derived from a weakly zygomorphic flower with four fertile stamens and a dorsal staminode  <cit> . therefore, opithandra represents an ideal candidate for exploring a potentially novel genetic mechanism underlying the establishment of zygomorphy with ventral stamen arrest in angiosperms, especially in lamiales s.l.

here we report that there is a correlation between opdcyc gene expressions and abortion of both the dorsal and ventral stamens in opithandra, strengthened by the negatively correlated expression of their putative direct target opdcyclind <dig> genes. the novel patterns of cyc-like gene expressions in opithandra indicate that ece-cyc <dig> clade tcp genes are involved in the ventral stamen repression evolved within lamiales s. l..

RESULTS
sequence and phylogenetic analyses of opdcyc and opdcyclind3
we isolated four cyc-like genes from opithandra dinghushanensis, named opdcyc1c, opdcyc1d, opdcyc2a and opdcyc2b. the full length open reading frames  of opdcyc1c, opdcyc1d, opdcyc2a and opdcyc2b are  <dig> base pair ,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . sequence analyses show that they share 43-48% and 45-51% identity with amcyc at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. when comparing the tcp and r domains, they share 90-95% identity with amcyc at the amino acid level, suggesting they are functionally related. phylogenetic analyses show that opdcyc genes have a close relationship with amcyc and amdich, and, along with amcyc and tcp <dig>  belong to the ece-cyc <dig> clade in the ece lineage  of tcp gene family  <cit>   . opdcyc genes are closely related to gcyc from oreocharis among gcyc genes in gesneriaceae .

two d3-type cyclin genes, designated as opdcyclind3a and opdcyclind3b, were isolated from o. dinghushanensis with full length orfs of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . the two d3-type cyclin genes contain a cyclin box  <cit>  and the putative -binding motif  which are found both in animals  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses show that opdcyclind <dig> genes belong to cyclind3a and cyclind3b clade, respectively, in the cyclind <dig> lineages, in which they have close relations with amcyclind3a and amcyclind3b from a.majus, respectively .

gene mrna expression patterns
to assess the potential role of cyc-like genes in floral development, we conducted in situ hybridization complemented by gene-specific rt-pcr on o. dinghushanensis. as petal and stamen primordia began to emerge, opdcyc1c mrna was detected in all five petal and stamen primordia . weak mrna signals were also detectable in the lateral edges and vascular tissue of sepals . after primordial initiation of petals and stamens, opdcyc1c expression signals were gradually weakened in the two lateral stamens  with weak mrna detected in the ring meristem of the corolla-tube outside the stamen primordia . figures 3c and 3d were the successive sections from the same individual flower across the base of stamen primordia  and over their upper parts , respectively, which showed a size reduction from the base to the upper part of the dorsal and ventral stamens. the mrna signal of opdcyc1c was weak in lateral stamens while strong in both dorsal and ventral staminodes in which its mrna signal was stronger in the upper part than at the base . opdcyc1c mrna also accumulated less in lateral petals than in dorsal and ventral petals . as the lateral stamens enlarged laterally, weak opdcyc1c mrna shifted to peripheries and gradually became undetectable in the two lateral stamens, while opdcyc1c transcripts continued to accumulate to a high level in the dorsal and ventral staminodes . meanwhile, opdcyc1c mrna became weak and not easily detectable in petals . weak mrna signals of opdcyc1c were also detected in the gynoecial primordium . in the middle developmental stages with flower buds about  <dig> mm long, as stamens began filament elongation and anther differentiation, opdcyc1c was strongly expressed in the dorsal region  and ventral staminode shown in rt-pcr while its weak mrna signal was detected in sepals, lateral and ventral petals, and lateral stamens, in which the signal was much weaker in sepals and lateral stamens . in the late stages, opdcyc1c transcripts declined in the dorsal region and ventral staminodes, and were undetectable in other regions . the opdcyc1c mrna was undetectable in stamens as pollen sacs began development in the two lateral anthers while the two ventral anthers became sterile .

in contrast to opdcyc1c, opdcyc2a mrna densely accumulated in the dorsal region of the floral apex as petals and stamens became visible . then, the opdcyc2a expression signal was specifically concentrated in the dorsal petals and the dorsal staminode . as floral organs developed, opdcyc2a transcripts continued to be highly concentrated at the dorsal staminode and the dorsal-most parts of the two dorsal petals . in the middle stages, the strong mrna signal of opdcyc2a was detected in the dorsal region  shown in rt-pcr that declined in late stages with no signal in other regions . its mrna was undetectable in stamens as pollen sacs began development in the two lateral anthers while the two ventral anthers became sterile . even though opdcyc1d expression was undetectable in floral tissues using in situ hybridization , its very weak mrna signals were detected in the dorsal region  from middle to late stages using rt-pcr . opdcyc2b mrna was not detectable in floral tissues both using in situ hybridization and rt-pcr . no signal was detected in floral tissues with sense probes of opdcyc1c  and opdcyc2a .

to further elucidate the role of opdcyc genes in floral development of opithandra dinghushanensis, we carried out semiquantitative rt-pcr studies of two opdcyclind <dig> genes because cyclind <dig> genes were previously revealed to be negatively controlled by cyc as shown in the mid-to-late stage flowers in the model organism snapdragon  <cit> . rt-pcr results showed that opdcyclind3a was strongly expressed in lateral stamens from middle to late stages while its weak mrna signal was also detected in lateral and ventral petals . opdcyclind3a mrna was not detected either in the dorsal region  and ventral staminodes . opdcyclind3b transcripts were widely distributed in floral tissues except ventral staminodes, in which its mrna signal was strong in lateral stamens from middle to late stages . transcripts of opdcyclind3b detected in the dorsal region were likely mainly distributed in the dorsal petals ).

discussion
the androecium of opithandra only has two fertile stamens at the lateral positions with three sterile stamens  at the dorsal and ventral sides  . the dorsal aborted stamen is tiny and barely detectable at anthesis while the two infertile ventral stamens have short filaments with very small and sterile anthers . correlative with the differentiation along the dorsoventral axis of the morphologically peculiar androecium, the opdcyc2a strong expression is restricted to the dorsal staminode while opdcyc1c transcripts are initially distributed in all five stamen primordia but later are concentrated in the dorsal and ventral staminodes to late stages. in the ece lineage of cyc/tb <dig> subfamily, the tcp proteins in ece-cyc <dig> clade studied to date function as negative regulators in stamen development, whereas they appear to vary in petal development according to the trait concerned  <cit> . the abortion of the dorsal stamen in antirrhinum comes from cyc and dich activities  <cit> . the cyc-like gene expression expansion from the dorsal to both the dorsal and lateral stamens is correlated with abortion of both the dorsal and lateral stamens in mohavea and chirita  <cit> . tb <dig> gene exhibits a mix feature of ece-cyc <dig> and ece-cyc <dig> clades and functions to suppress axillary meristem  while retard stamen growth  in maize  <cit> . in asteraceae, a cyc homologue ghcyc <dig> from gerbera functions by disrupting stamen development  <cit> . given that cyc-like gene  function is conserved in repressing stamen development, opdcyc2a expression restricted to the dorsal stamen and opdcyc1c expression later concentrated in the dorsal and ventral stamens in the third whorl might be related to abortion of the dorsal and ventral stamens in opithandra. in fact, the successive sections from the same individual flower indicate that correlative with opdcyc gene strong expression, the early primordial growth have already been retarded in the dorsal and ventral staminodes in comparison with that in the lateral stamens.

evidence shows that cyc functions to repress stamen development in the third whorl through its negative effect on expression of d3-type cyclin genes, including cyclind3b, which usually play an important role in locally regulating cell proliferation in floral development  <cit> . the negative effects on cell cycle progression have been reported from other tcp genes, such as iatcp <dig> from iberis , tcp <dig> and tcp <dig> from arabidopsis, and cin from antirrhinum  <cit> . we, therefore, investigated the expression pattern of opdcyclind3a and d3b to test for further correlation between cyc expression and stamen abortion through cell-cycle regulation, especially the ventral stamens. in strengthening the above suggestion, opdcyclind <dig> genes have expression patterns in floral tissues negatively correlated with those of opdcyc genes and stamen abortion in opithandra. both opdcyclin d3a and d3b transcripts are not detected, or weakly detected , in the dorsal and ventral staminodes where both opdcyc2a and opdcyc1c or opdcyc1c are strongly and continuously expressed throughout floral development, while their transcripts are much more concentrated in the lateral stamens where there is only a weak expression of opdcyc1c in early stages. these factors indicate that opdcyc gene activities may suppress the development of the dorsal and ventral stamens through negatively regulating opdcyclind <dig> genes . our recent findings of consensus-binding sites of the tcp transcription factor in the 5' upstream regions of opdcyclind <dig> homologues, i.e. chcyclind3a and d3b in chirita heterotricha, further support the direct regulatory relation between cyc-like and cyclind <dig> genes in gesneriaceae .

it seemingly remains a question whether opdcyc activity is related to the lateral stamen development or not because opdcyc1c has a weak expression in the early developing lateral stamens but has no obvious effect on their growth. the evidence that cyc-like genes regulate lateral stamen development comes from both functional analyses in antirrhinum and expression data in mohavea and chirita  <cit> . a gradient of cyc effect along the dorsoventral axis results in abortion of the dorsal stamen and reduced size of lateral stamens in comparison with ventral ones in a. majus, while cyc-like gene strong and continuous expressions in both the dorsal and lateral stamens is correlated with abortion of both of them in mohavea and chirita  <cit> . the tcp <dig> gene is expressed early in floral buds of arabidopsis, but the mature flowers of arabidopsis are actinomorphic because they lack later effects of tcp <dig>  <cit> . in iberis amara closely related to arabidopsis, the iatcp <dig> strong dorsal-specific expression represses the two dorsal petal growths to become much smaller than the ventral ones in size, while iatcp <dig> has only a weak expressional signal in the natural actinomorphic variants  <cit> . in the tetrandrous flowers of oreocharis that is closely related to opithandra in both morphology and gcyc phylogeny  <cit>  , there is also a weak expression of cyc homologue obcyc in the early developing lateral stamens that are reduced in size compared with ventral ones at anthesis as in a. majus  <cit> . in bournea, another opithandra's close relative with actinomorphic flowers in gesneriaceae, the cyc homologue blcyc <dig> is strongly expressed in the dorsal petal and stamen in early development and is downregulated later, which is correlated with the floral development undergoing a morphological transition from initial zygomorphy to actinomorphy at anthesis with five fertile stamens in bournea  <cit> . according to cubas  <cit> , the maintenance of cyc expression after early floral development should be important for generating the morphological asymmetries in the flowers. preston and hileman  <cit>  also suggest that early expression of cyc-like genes may be unimportant for establishing mature flower symmetry. the high concentration of opdcyclind3a and d3b transcripts in the lateral stamens also indicates that opdcyc1c has lost negative effects on their expression after early floral development; therefore, the two lateral stamens are fertile at anthesis in opithandra .

zygomorphic flowers with three staminodes at the dorsal and lateral positions or at the dorsal and ventral sides have been considered to be derived in the family gesneriaceae  <cit> . in the primitive zygomorphic taxa, such as haberlea and oreocharis characteristic of tetrandrous flowers with four didynamous stamens plus a dorsal staminode, and the derived actinomorphic groups , such as ramonda and bournea, there is only one single copy of gcyc <dig> and gcyc <dig>  respectively, found to date   <cit> . however, two copies of gcyc <dig> are frequently found in the advanced zygomorphic taxa, especially in the zygomorphic genera characterized by diandrous flowers with three staminodes, such as two african genera streptocarpus and saintpaulia with gcyc1a and gcyc1b  <cit>  and asian genera didymocarpus, chirita and loxostigma with gcyc1c and gcyc1d  <cit>  as well as opithandra herein . recent studies show that two copies of gcyc <dig>  are also found in the asian genera with three staminodes, such as chirita  <cit>  and opithandra in this study . the derived morphology of diandrous flowers might have resulted from subsequent expression differentiation after gene duplication events. in the diandrous flowers of chirita  that differs from opithandra in abortion of both the dorsal and lateral stamens rather than ventral stamens, chcyc1c is strongly expressed both in the dorsal and lateral stamens while chcyc1d maintains strong expressions in the dorsal floral regions, and chcyc2a/2b have no expression signals in floral tissues  <cit> . no expression of gcyc <dig> detected in floral tissue is frequently found in gesneriaceae while gcyc <dig> is usually conserved in dorsal-specific expression in this family, such as oreocharis and bournea  <cit> . therefore, the peculiar diandrous flowers established in opithandra might involved not only gained or enhanced expression of opdcyc1c in ventral staminodes but also the reactivated expression of opdcyc2a specific to the dorsal staminode accompanied with the downregulation of opdcyc1d in the dorsal region in the third whorl, a more complicated mechanism than that in another diandrous flowers of chirita.

phylogenetic analyses show that the cyc-like genes isolated from opithandra and other gesneriaceae belong to ece-cyc <dig> clade as cyc and tcp <dig> from antirrhinum and arabidopsis   <cit> . as outlined above, ece-cyc <dig> clade genes are characteristic of dorsal identity function which sometimes expands to lateral stamens  <cit> . it would be especially interesting to know whether or how cyc-like gene activities are related to abortion of the ventral stamens  <cit> . even though not tested functionally, this positive correlation between cyc-like gene expression and ventral stamen abortion and the complement of cyclind <dig> to cyc-like gene expressions suggests a genetic mechanism underlying the establishment of zygomorphy with abortion of both the dorsal and ventral stamen evolved within lamiales s.l.. however, it has been shown for veronica and gratiola  that the cyc-like gene expression does not positively correlate with the ventral stamen abortion . these facts inconsonant in the expression data of ece-cyc <dig> clade tcp genes imply that the ventral stamen abortion might have evolved by convergent genetic mechanisms in different lineages of lamiales s.l.. it merits further research in function and upstream regulatory pathway to determine how the expression divergence is caused among paralogues of opdcyc in opithandra. in addition, since the diverse variations of zygomorphy in lamiales s.l. might have involved independent shifts in stamen number  <cit> , further investigation of expression pattern and functional analyses of cyc-like genes with identification of their upstream cis- or trans-regulators as well as research in finding other factors possibly coopted to this regulatory pathway in more zygomorphic groups would shed new lights on the mechanisms that underlie the vast morphological diversity of zygomorphy in lamiales s.l..

CONCLUSIONS
as the first to document the expression domain of ece-cyc clade genes in the ventral stamens, we here report that the expressions of opdcyc genes are correlated with abortion of both dorsal and ventral stamens in opithandra, strengthened by the negatively correlated expression of their putative direct target opdcyclind <dig> genes. the complement of opdcyclind <dig> to opdcyc gene expressions further indicates that opdcyc expressions are related to the dorsal and ventral stamen abortion through the negative effect on opdcyclind <dig> genes. the novel patterns of cyc-like gene expressions in opithandra, along with previous reports, suggest that ece-cyc <dig> clade tcp genes are not only functionally conserved in the dorsal stamen repression, but also involved in arresting ventral stamens, a genetic mechanism underlying the establishment of zygomorphy with abortion of both the dorsal and ventral stamens evolved within lamiales s.l.. it would be important to further find whether ece-cyc <dig> clade tcp genes are recruited repeatedly for arresting ventral stamens and  whether there is any other genetic pathways underlying the ventral stamen abortion, independently or interacting with ece-cyc <dig> clade tcp genes, in different lineages of lamiales s.l..
