BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming, aerobic, gram-positive bacterium is the causative agent of the disease anthrax. the fact that the b. anthracis spores are highly lethal, inexpensively made, easily produced and disseminated as weapons of terror, necessitates the need for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and virulence factors of this organism using human cells  <cit> . in all forms of anthrax, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or cutaneous, b. anthracis spores are phagocytosed by residing intestinal, alveolar, or skin macrophages where they germinate into vegetative bacilli. the macrophages then travel to the lymph nodes where the vegetative b. anthracis must escape the macrophage's vacuole into the cytoplasm and eventually the macrophage itself. bacilli multiply in the lymphatics and enter the bloodstream, where they can reach numbers of  <dig> to  <dig> per milliliter  <cit> .

bacillus anthracis vegetative bacteria express virulence factors that are encoded by two virulence plasmids, pxo <dig> and pxo <dig>  <cit> . pxo <dig>  the toxin gene-bearing, regulatory plasmid, encodes the known components of b. anthracis exotoxins: lethal factor , edema factor  and protective antigen . together with pxo <dig>  the capsule producing plasmid, anthrax toxins are thought to be responsible for the high morbidity and pathology of anthrax during the late stage of disease and have been a primary focus of b. anthracis research for decades. although anthrax lethal toxin  may contribute significantly to septicemia and death of the host, other virulence factors may be important in establishing infection and may contribute to disease  <cit> .

in vitro and in vivo, vegetative b. anthracis express and secrete a protein which is member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin  family of cytolysins. the protein, which we have named anthrolysin o , acts as a hemolysin against human red blood cells and is differentially regulated by environmental signals  <cit> . members of the cdc family of cytolysins are secreted and bind cholesterol and other molecules in the host cell plasma membrane forming large pores which range in diameter from  <dig> to  <dig> nm  <cit> . the formation of pores in cholesterol-containing membranes confers this family of toxin's hemolytic and cytolytic properties. cdcs are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of more than  <dig> gram-positive species including arcanobacterium pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . at high concentrations, cdcs function as cytotoxins, lysing host immune cells; perfringolysin o, pfo, is cytolytic to macrophages; pneumolysin, ply, lyses murine macrophages and bovine pmns, and; slo of s. pyrogenes lyses human pmns  <cit> . many of these pathogens secrete cdcs in sub-lytic amounts that function to modulate phagocytic cell function by inhibiting chemotaxis, the oxidative burst, or phagocytosis, and activate complement  <cit> . most recently cdcs, including alo, have been described as tlr <dig> agonists  <cit> .

during b. anthracis infection the events associated with phagocyte membrane disruption, phagocyte death, and escape of vegetative bacilli from the phagocyte have yet to be fully elucidated. this prompted us to examine the role that alo might play as a cytolysin against human phagocytes. we hypothesize that alo can be defined as a new b. anthracis virulence factor, which has the ability to lyse human monocytes, human monocyte-derived macrophages , lymphocytes and neutrophils .

our studies reveal by trypan blue exclusion assay and by the release of ldh, that purified recombinant alo  is cytolytic to thp- <dig> monocytes, freshly isolated pmns, lymphocytes, hmdms, me- <dig>  detroit  <dig>  and a <dig> epithelial cells. furthermore, using sterne strain  <dig>  an alo-negative mutant, and a complemented strain expressing the native alo gene, we show that viable, vegetative b. anthracis, or their supernatants, lyse thp- <dig> s and macrophages in a dose dependent manner. we demonstrate that the death of the leukocytes is dependent upon alo.

RESULTS
recombinant alo lyses human primary phagocytes and lymphocytes in a dose and time dependent manner
overnight growth supernatants from sterne strain  <dig> and ralo are hemolytic to human  <cit>  and mouse red blood cells . however, we did not know if alo was cytolytic to human leukocytes. because of the lethal effects of other cdcs on human and mouse phagocytes, we hypothesized that alo would act similarly, lysing human phagocytes and lymphocytes  <cit> . we assayed for the ability of purified ralo to lyse freshly isolated human neutrophils by incubating neutrophils under serum-free conditions with a range of ralo concentrations. addition of trypan blue to the cells and subsequent blind counting of at least  <dig> cells, show that as little as  <dig> ng/ml of ralo, which is approximately  <dig>  nm, lysed neutrophils . lysis of the cells occurred within  <dig> min and little difference was seen at later time points. addition of heat-inactivated 10% fbs before the addition of ralo inhibited lysis at all concentrations tested. likewise, when  <dig> μg/ml of free cholesterol was pre-incubated with ralo before addition to the pmns, viability of the pmns remained the same as controls .

to determine if human monocytes and macrophages were as susceptible to ralo mediated lysis as human neutrophils, we assayed the death of the human monocyte line thp- <dig> and hmdms after incubation with ralo. viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion and verified using an ldh based cytotoxicity assay. in the absence of serum  <dig>  ng/ml, or  <dig>  nm, of ralo caused  <dig> % lysis of thp-1s. these results indicate that pmns are  <dig> times more sensitive to alo mediated lysis than are thp-1s .

macrophages are thought to be the primary cells in/on which b. anthracis spores germinate, thus we sought to determine the cytolytic effect of ralo on primary hmdms that had been differentiated for  <dig> days with m-csf. after incubation for  <dig> min with ralo, in the absence of serum, the viability of hmdms was assayed by trypan blue dye exclusion. in dose-response experiments, ralo was cytolytic to hmdms . as seen with human neutrophils and thp- <dig> monocytes, hmdms are differentially lysed by ralo, requiring approximately  <dig> ng/ml, or  <dig>  nm ralo to cause  <dig> % lysis.

lymphocytes, although not cells of focus in b. anthracis infection, were also tested for their susceptibility to ralo lysis after observing different degrees of cell cytotoxicity depending upon the cell type assayed. much like thp-1s, total lymphocytes isolated from human blood were lysed by ralo in a dose dependent manner in both the absence and, significantly to a lesser extent, in the presence of heat-inactivated 10% fbs  . approximately  <dig> ng/ml, or  <dig>  nm, of ralo was needed to cause  <dig> % lysis of human lymphocytes.

after establishing ralo's ability to lyse phagocytes and lymphocytes and observing their varying susceptibility to ralo-mediated lysis, we were prompted to investigate ralo's ability to lyse epithelial cells. cells of the epithelial cell line me- <dig> and detroit  <dig> were incubated with varying concentrations of recombinant alo for  <dig> min. the plate was briefly centrifuged and the supernatants used to determine percent viability using ldh release. surprisingly, our results show that a much greater ralo concentration, almost  <dig> μg/ml, is required to cause  <dig> % lysis of me- <dig> cells and detroit  <dig> cells in the absence of serum . there was no decrease in me- <dig> epithelial cell viability even after a  <dig> h incubation. similar results were observed using trypan blue exclusion. in contrast, when a <dig> lung epithelial cells were assayed for viability, approximately  <dig> ng/ml, or  <dig>  nm of ralo was needed to cause 50% lysis .

native alo lyses human monocytes and macrophages
to determine the role of alo in b. anthracis-mediated cytotoxicity we investigated the ability of b. anthracis growth supernatants to lyse hmdms. we asked the question whether native, secreted alo lysed phagocytes in a similar manner to ralo. we have quantified the amount of alo present in the supernatant of the alo-overproducing strain, ut <dig> , by elisa and hemolysis assays using a standard curve of ralo . supernatant of ut <dig>  grown in bhi contains  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml alo. hemolysis assays revealed that the parent strain,  <dig>  grown under the same conditions, produces approximately  <dig> -fold less alo. hemolysis is abrogated by the addition of  <dig> μg/ml of free cholesterol, indicating that the hemolysis is caused by alo  <cit>  . using this knowledge, late exponential phase cell free supernatants from the wild-type strain,  <dig>  were compared to supernatants obtained from the alo knockout strain, ut <dig>  and the complemented overproducing strain, ut <dig> , in their ability to lyse hmdms. we hypothesized that strains producing alo would be more cytolytic to hmdms than the alo knockout strain. supernatants of strains  <dig> and ut <dig>  caused significantly greater amounts of cytolysis of hmdms than the alo knockout strain ut <dig> . some cytolytic variability is seen from blood donor to blood donor, however overall lytic death occurs in a dose and strain, i.e. alo dependent manner . thus, native alo, in addition to ralo, lyses human macrophages.

bacillus anthracis secreting alo lyses human monocytes and macrophages
similarly, to determine if alo played a role in the ability of live b. anthracis to lyse phagocytes, b. anthracis strains  <dig>  ut <dig> , and ut <dig>   were grown to late log phase in bhi, washed and incubated with cells of the human monocytic cell line thp- <dig>  our results show that only bacteria expressing alo completely lyse thp-1s in the absence of serum. statistical analyses at a moi of  <dig> at the  <dig> min,  <dig> h and  <dig> h timepoints show that  <dig> and ut <dig>  lyse significantly more thp-1s than the alo knock-out, ut <dig> . similar significance was also observed at a moi of  <dig> after  <dig> h and  <dig> h. the decrease in viability by ut <dig>  at an moi of  <dig>  and to a lesser extent at moi of  <dig>  was noted, perhaps due to the effects of the major anthrax toxins or unknown toxins. however, an alo-dependent dose and time response was observed when thp- <dig> cells were incubated with the alo over-producing strain and  <dig> over the  <dig> h time course examined. therefore, addition of whole bacteria secreting alo reproduced the observed cytolytic effects seen with purified recombinant protein.

addition of cholesterol abrogates alo cytotoxicity of human monocytes
the presence of free cholesterol inhibits alo-mediated lysis  <cit> . to support our hypothesis that alo causes the observed cytolysis of thp- <dig> monocytes, cholesterol inhibition studies were performed. at an moi of  <dig> bacteria:monocyte the lysis caused by b. anthracis  <dig>  and the complemented strain expressing alo, ut <dig>   at  <dig> min was completely inhibited by pre-incubation of monocytes with heat-inactivated 10% fbs . similar results were seen using  <dig> μg/ml cholesterol . after  <dig> h incubation insufficient amounts of cholesterol were present to inhibit the lysis caused by ut <dig> . these results are consistent with the inhibition of alo's hemolytic activity by  <dig> μg/ml cholesterol in hemolysis assays and show that the observed b. anthracis cytotoxicity is a direct result of native alo .

discussion
in vitro, under nutrient rich growth conditions, and in vivo b. anthracis expresses and secretes a protein that is a member of the cdc family of cytolysins, which we have named alo  <cit> . cdcs are closely involved in the pathogenesis of several gram-positive bacteria, acting both lytically to lyse cells as well as sub-lytically, modulating the immune response and basic immune cell function  <cit> . cdcs, including alo, stimulate through tlr <dig>  interestingly, alo in conjunction with lt, at sub-lytic concentrations, is responsible for inducing apoptosis of macrophages. furthermore, as a tlr <dig> agonist, alo has the ability to induce an inflammatory response  <cit> . during the course of b. anthracis infection, the local concentration or expression of alo likely varies, thus we hypothesized that alo may act similarly to other cdcs and lyse human phagocytes, lymphocytes and epithelial cells. the secretion of a cdc by b. anthracis under certain growth conditions and the ability of this cdc to lyse human leukocytes may have implications regarding our understanding of basic b. anthracis pathogenesis.

our results demonstrate that alo causes cytolysis of primary human macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and cells of the thp- <dig> human monocyte cell line in a dose and time dependent manner. purified ralo, native alo and b. anthracis expressing alo all lyse human leukocytes. the observed cytotoxicity correlates with the proposed mode of action of alo, namely, a multiunit accumulation of alo molecules within the membrane of cells resulting in pore formation. leukocyte and lymphocyte lysis by alo occurred within  <dig> min, which is indicative of necrotic death. likewise, when ralo-treated cells were assayed for apoptotic death by ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining, necrosis, but no apoptosis was evident .

alo cytotoxicity varied significantly in the different human cell types tested. pmns were the most sensitive to alo mediated lysis with  <dig> % lysis occurring at just  <dig>  nm alo. thp- <dig> monocytes, lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more resistant to alo than were pmns, respectively. remarkably, in similar conditions, me- <dig> and detroit  <dig> epithelial cells were  <dig> times more resistant to alo-mediated lysis than pmns . these differences in sensitivities between cell types are presently under study.

like ralo, alo-producing b. anthracis strains were cytolytic for human phagocytes. cytotoxicity was abrogated by addition of cholesterol, confirming that lysis by b. anthracis is alo-dependent under the conditions tested. cholesterol is required for the binding of cdcs to cell membranes, and addition of free cholesterol acts as a competitive inhibitor for cdc binding and pore formation  <cit> . it is important to note, however, that intermedilysin does not use cholesterol as its receptor. instead, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein human cd <dig> is required for pore formation  <cit> . in cytotoxicity assays in which sterne strain  <dig>  the over-expressing ut <dig> , or the alo- strain ut <dig> were incubated with thp- <dig> monocytes, only bacteria producing alo caused a dose and time dependent lysis of the cells .

we have previously shown that during late exponential phase maximal amounts of alo are secreted by b. anthracis, thus we assessed hmdm lysis by native alo using bacterial growth supernatants <cit> . when hmdms were incubated with cell free late exponential phase growth supernatants from the parent strain  <dig>  a defined alo knockout ut <dig>  or the over-expressing alo strain ut <dig> , significantly less cytotoxicity was observed with ut <dig> supernatants compared to supernatants of the parent and overproducing strains, indicating that alo is the major factor contributing to the cytotoxicity of these phagocytes  . these results strongly indicate that alo is responsible alone or in conjunction with other toxins for the observed lysis. the death observed when ut <dig> , supernatants were incubated with the hmdms may be attributed to the major toxins, lt and et. overall, these data support our hypothesis that alo at lethal concentrations may be involved with anthrax pathogenesis by lysing human neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages or by rendering them non-functional.

the mechanism responsible for the differential susceptibility of the human phagocytes and epithelial cells to alo is largely unaccounted for and remains an interest of our lab. in cholesterol depletion experiments, lysis of thp-1s and mouse macrophages raw  <dig>  cells is abrogated after the addition of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, suggesting that in these cell types cholesterol is an important receptor for the pore forming toxin   <cit> . it may be hypothesized that a difference in membrane cholesterol composition exists among the cell types tested. streptolysin o and pneumolysin and have shown different sensitivities to macrophages, monocytes and epithelial cells, respectively. these differences have been hypothesized to be the result of basic membrane composition and lipid raft content, however there are many factors that could contribute to differences in cell sensitivity  <cit> . me- <dig> and detroit  <dig> epithelial cells may be resistant to lysis even in the absence of free cholesterol due to carbohydrate moieties in the cell membrane that could impede pore formation. on the other hand, perhaps there is an unidentified protein receptor necessary for pore formation in these cells. we also observed differences between detroit  <dig> and a <dig> epithelial cells, which reside in the pharynx and lung, respectively. these epithelial cells represent those that b. anthracis would likely come in contact with during inhalational anthrax. the observed differences in cell sensitivity are currently under study. importantly, alo has recently been identified as one of the hemolytic virulence factors secreted by b. anthracis that is responsible for increasing shedding of synd <dig> and e-cadherin from epithelial cells, compromising the epithelial barrier integrity and perhaps leading to dissemination of infection  <cit> .

differential cell susceptibility may have implications regarding alo's importance in b. anthracis pathogenesis. perhaps pmns, which are cells known to be first responders during bacterial infections, are quickly eliminated by alo secreted by b. anthracis. conversely, alo may be less cytolytic to macrophages, a primary cell of b. anthracis pathogenesis, allowing spores to germinate and b. anthracis to persist for a greater length of time inside macrophages. although we do not know the amount of alo expressed by b. anthracis within macrophages or when growing in human blood, klichko, et al. have noted that alo is expressed at the early stages of infection within mouse macrophages by vegetative bacilli after spore germination  <cit> . additionally, alo mrna has been detected in the spleens of b. anthracis infected mice, indicating that the gene is expressed in vivo . furthermore, antibodies against alo have been found in mice infected with sterne strain b. anthracis spores, indicating that alo is produced in vivo in concentrations high enough to elicit an immune response  <cit> .

the cytotoxic role of alo in anthrax pathogenesis, if any, has thus far not been elucidated. however, this study has shown that alo, like its cdc counterparts, is able to lyse phagocytes. in murine models of pulmonary anthrax, disseminated anthrax results in pathological lesions in the spleen, ranging from mild to severe necrotizing splenitis. lung associated lymph nodes also undergo complete cytolysis  <cit> . whether this cytolysis is caused by lt, or other toxins, remains to be delineated. alo most likely acts locally, rather than systemically, affecting pmn recruitment, macrophage function, or it may confer bacteria an advantage while in or near phagocytes. we have shown that fewer than  <dig> molecules of ralo are required to cause 100% lysis of human erythrocytes  <cit> . this suggests that b. anthracis would not have to secrete much alo within the phagocytic vacuole, within the macrophage cytoplasm, or locally in order to initiate a biological response or death of the phagocyte  <cit> . alo may be important in the b. anthracis macrophage interface whether it be from without or from within macrophages either before or after phagocytosis of the bacilli occur. dixon, et al. suggested that escape from the macrophage is pxo <dig> independent and that a gene in the chromosomal dma may serve to allow the escape from the macrophage  <cit> . furthermore, lysis of host cells by cdcs helps bacteria avoid the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells and aids in evasion of the host immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
the function of alo's ability to lyse human phagocytes in b. anthracis pathogenesis is unclear, but this cdc may contribute to the bacteria's ability to establish, spread, or cause disease along with the other more characterized toxins. this study further supports alo as an important virulence factor of b. anthracis. not only can it act at sub-lethal concentrations with lt to induce apoptosis, but this study demonstrates that alone, at higher concentrations, alo causes cytolysis of human phagocytes and epithelial cells. the study of other factors produced by b. anthracis, along with the major anthrax toxins, will lead to a better understanding of this bacterium's pathogenesis as well as provide more information for the development of anti-toxin vaccines for treating and preventing anthrax  <cit> .
