BACKGROUND
the extraordinary sensitivity and virtually unlimited dynamic range of real-time pcr makes it the preferred technology for quantitative gene expression profiling. using microarray technology expression of entire genomes can be measured, identifying candidates for expression profiling. after validation of these genes on representative samples by real-time pcr, eliminating any false leads and possibly complementing with other genes, powerful panels of expression markers can be identified. the recent development of high throughput real-time pcr platforms  <cit>  will spur the development further. to extract maximum information from profiling experiments using such panels, methods to pre-process and process the gene expression data are needed.

the addition of glucose to saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown in ethanol causes an extensive reprogramming of gene expression and metabolism, making it a suitable model system to understand gene regulation. in this system glucose consumption rate correlates with glucose repression  <cit> . we have previously reported on a series of strains, in which glucose uptake is mediated by different native and chimeric hexose transporters, which display a wide range of glucose uptake rates  <cit> . these strains are useful for investigating the effects of different glycolytic rates on glucose-induced signaling pathways. many glucose induced and glucose repressed genes have been extensively studied, but several genes believed to be associated with metabolism remain poorly characterized. the alcohol dehydrogenases  are such group. its first two members, adh <dig> and adh <dig>  have well known characteristics  <cit> , while the functions of adh3- <dig> are poorly understood  <cit> .

we have previously shown that glucose uptake is the rate limiting step for glycolytic flux in strains expressing a series of individual glucose transporters with reduced transport capacity  <cit> . ethanol production, also under aerobic conditions, in saccharomyces cerevisiae is believed to be a result of overflow metabolism where rate limitation of the tca cycle results in a flux towards ethanol production  <cit> . in this study we were interested in exploring transcriptional responses of some of the less characterized adh-genes to better understand their regulations under conditions of different glycolytic rates.

here, four yeast strains representing the full range of glycolytic rates; namely, wild-type , hxt-hxt <dig> , hxt-tm6* , and hxt-null  were selected to study the responses of metabolic genes. in previous works we have shown that ethanol production rate correlates to glycolytic rate  <cit> , which pointed us in the direction of the adh-genes and in particular the less studied adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig> and adh <dig>  here we address whether a decrease in the rate of ethanol production rate can be attributed in part to the roles of the adh-genes. the study is a 3-way design, with the three ways being  genotype,  gene, and  time. we use a variant of genorm  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit>  to find suitable reference genes for normalization along all three ways, and we present suitable pre-processing of the data for analysis. finally, the data are analyzed by augmented principal component analysis , which is a variant of pca for 3-way studies  <cit> . the classification obtained by the augmented pca is verified by hierarchical clustering and clustering by the self-organizing map   <cit> . the analyses classify the genes into five groups with characteristic temporal profiles, based on which functional similarities between the adh3- <dig> genes and previously more characterized genes can be found.

RESULTS
experimental setup and gene selection
in this study four yeast strains koy.pk2-1c <dig> , koy.hxt7p , koy.tm6*p  and koy.vw100p  were used. in the hxt-hxt <dig>  hxt-tm6* and hxt-null strains, the genes hxt1-hxt <dig>  gal <dig>  stl <dig> and three maltose permeases  have been deleted. this results in a strain unable to take up glucose as measured by uptake of radiolabeled c13-glucose  <cit> . into this hxt-null strain we introduced either hxt <dig>  or tm6* . the four strains used have high, intermediate, low and zero glucose consumption rates, i.e. glycolytic rates  <cit> . they were grown on ethanol and exposed to glucose to follow the transcriptional responses of a series of selected genes. samples were collected before and during one hour after the pulse to study the short term response of the genes.

genes known to be induced or repressed in wild-type strain, with normal glycolytic flux, were included in the study to allow for the classification of the adh-genes . the established glucose induced genes were triose-phosphate isomerase  <dig> , phosphoglycerate kinase  <dig> , pyruvate decarboxylase  and alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig> , which are all members of the lower glycolysis  <cit> . the established glucose repressed genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle genes were fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  and malate dehydrogenase  <dig>   <cit> . in addition, sucrose fermentation  was included, which is a well studied target gene of glucose repression/derepression  <cit> , the multicopy inhibitor of gal , which is a central repressor of suc <dig>  <cit> , the mitochondria localized cytocrome c , which is regulated by mig <dig> and repressed by glucose  <cit>  and heat shock protein  <dig> , which is known to be repressed by very low glucose concentrations and is also stress induced  <cit> . inorganic pyrophosphatase , actin , and pyruvate dehydrogenase  <dig>  were included as tentative house-keeping/reference genes. in addition to the well characterized genes, for which raw data have been partly reported before  <cit> , we also included a series of adh-genes  that are less well understood, to investigate their responses in relation to different glycolytic rates. throughout this paper the genes in figures and tables are color coded as follows: adh <dig>  pgk <dig>  tpi <dig>  pdc <dig> and mig <dig> genes, which are expected to be induced by glucose, are shown in blue, fbp <dig>  adh <dig>  mdh <dig> and suc <dig>  which are expected to be repressed by glucose, are shown in red, adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig> and adh <dig> genes, whose functions are rather unknown, are shown in yellow, hsp <dig> is shown in black and cyc <dig> in green.

validation of reference genes
for proper comparison samples should be normalized. parameters such as mass, volume, cell number and total rna have been used but none of these can compensate for variations in rna quality and the presence of reaction inhibitors. today, normalization is usually performed with internal reference genes, which always should be validated to have constant expression under the conditions of the study  <cit> . identifying appropriate reference genes for data normalization and validating them on representative samples is a challenging problem in expression profiling, because the expression of all genes seem to be regulated under some conditions. different algorithms have been developed to identify the most suitable reference genes. genorm  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit>  are among the most popular. the two methods are based on somewhat different assumptions. while genorm identifies the pair of genes with most correlated expression relative to all the other genes by an elimination approach, normfinder identifies the gene that shows least variation. normfinder also distinguishes between intra- and inter-group variation, where the latter is the systematic difference in expression between the subgroups . the data, in the form of cycle of threshold -values, were arranged in one matrix per strain, with the genes as columns and the sampled time points as rows. the two pcr replicates measured for each gene were averaged. the four  <dig> ×  <dig> matrices were then laminated into a  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix  and an extra classification column was added to index the strains. the results of genorm and normfinder are shown in figure  <dig>  genorm, which treats all data as a homogenous group, identified pda <dig> and ipp <dig> as the most stable pair of genes and act <dig> as the 3rd best reference gene candidate. normfinder selected the genes in the stability order pda <dig> > ipp <dig> > act <dig>  with all exhibiting insignificant intra and intergroup variability. hence, we conclude that act <dig>  ipp <dig> and pda <dig> are suitable reference genes for our study of yeast metabolism. this conclusion was supported by principal component analysis, which showed that act <dig>  ipp <dig> and pda <dig> cluster in scatter plots evidencing that they have similar behavior .

data pre-processing
data pre-processing was performed starting with the four matrices containing the measured ct-values. all ct-values reflected formation of targeted product as verified by melting curve analysis, and corrections for primer-dimer signals were not needed. for strain hxt-tm6* both technical repeats had failed for pda <dig> at  <dig> min, and the missing data was reproduced by interpolation. the ct-values were corrected for pcr efficiency  assuming e =  <dig>  for all assays in all strains:

 cte=100%=ctelog⁡log⁡ 

95% pcr efficiency was typical for the assays used in the saccharomyces cerevisiae matrix. however, it should also be stressed that correction for pcr efficiency has negligible effect on classification of multivariate expression data  <cit> . the pcr technical repeats were then averaged. next the ct-values for the genes of interest  were normalized with the average of the ct-values of the reference genes  pda <dig>  ipp <dig> and act1:

 ctgoi,norm=ctgoi−1n∑i=1nctrg 

this reduced the dimension of the data matrices to  <dig> ×  <dig>  next, the ct-values were converted to relative quantities 

 rq=2ct0−ct 

where ct <dig> is the ct-value measured immediately before glucose addition . rq was then converted to fold changes  with log <dig> base:

 fc = log <dig> 

the temporal expression profiles, expressed as fc, are shown for the wild-type strain in figure 4a. to give all genes equal weights for classification of expression profiles the data were autoscaled  by subtracting the mean expression of every gene in each strain  and dividing with the  standard deviation:

 fcas=/sd 

the average expression of each gene in each strain is now zero and its standard deviation is one. the autoscaled expression profiles for the yeast wild-type strain are shown in figure 4b .

classification of the genes' expression profiles with principal component analysis
the measured data consisted of eight time points  measured for fifteen genes of interest in each of the four strains. hence, the total number of data points was:  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  =  <dig>  clearly, to visualize such large amounts of data and to unravel patterns efficient methods are called for. the classical scatter plot is an intuitive way to visualize how genes are expressed in different samples. these are typically 2-dimensional plots where the two axes indicate the genes' expressions in the two samples. it is possible to indicate genes' expressions for three genes in a 3-dimensional scatter plot. but this is the limit, since we have no convenient way to plot data in more than three dimensions. to deal with higher order data multivariate biostatistical tools are required to reduce the number of dimensions without loss of essential information. a classical, widely used tool is principal components analysis . pca allows scientists to study many variables simultaneously. it reflects how the original variables are correlated, and also how the samples are grouped. principal components  are mathematical constructs that can be interpreted as linear combinations of the studied variables with the following important properties:

 the pcs are orthogonal. once a pc is linked to the behavior of one or several genes, one can be reasonably sure that this correlation is unique and these genes do not correlate substantially with other pcs. the numerical coefficients, ranging from - <dig> to + <dig>  given to each gene in each pc are called loadings and reflect how important the gene is to define this pc.

 the pcs are sequential. this means that the first, and by definition the most significant, pc can be interpreted as the line in the original multidimensional space of all the samples that best fits the expression data and, hence, explains most of the observed variability and accounts for most of the information. the second most significant pc can be visualized as a vector perpendicular to the first pc that fits the expression data best, and accounts for most of the variability that is not accounted for by the first pc. additional pcs are defined analogously. one can extract pcs until a certain percentage of all the information, let's say 80%, is accounted for, and then discard the remaining pcs, which will mainly reflect uncorrelated information and, hence, the experimental noise. in most cases it is not practical to calculate more than three pc's, since, as already mentioned, we are limited to make 3-dimensional plots. once the pcs have been calculated, the samples can be located in this new space using the scores, which specify the location of each sample on each pc. the original data can now be presented in a scores scatter plot to reveal groups among the samples or a loadings scatter plot to reveal groups among the genes. many times pc1-pc <dig> scatter plots are sufficient, but one can also construct pc1-pc2-pc <dig> scatter plots.

from the eigenvalues of the pca it was calculated that  <dig>  % of the variance in all the measured data is accounted for by the first two pc's, reinforcing the usefulness of the pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> loadings scatter plot. the third pc of the wild-type strain accounts for an additional 3% of the variability in the data. the third score vector has the shape of the derivative of the second vector , and sorts the genes based on when they reach intermediate extreme expression. genes that reach extreme expression after 10– <dig> minutes obtain positive pc <dig> loading, while genes reaching extreme expression within  <dig> minutes obtain negative pc <dig> loading. the genes in wild-type yeast are clustered based on all three pc's in the pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> loadings scatter plot in figure 4e. in the 3d loadings scatter plot, mig <dig> separates from the other induced genes, because its expression reaches maximum at an earlier time. the 3-dimensional plot accounts for  <dig>  % of all the variability, which is essentially all biologically relevant information; remaining variability is mainly experimental noise. this can be verified by comparing the wild-type temporal expression profiles with those reproduced from the three main pc's. the agreement is excellent evidencing that the three pc's have indeed picked up all the important features of the genes' expression profiles in wild-type yeast . these features are:

1) expression either increases or decreases

2) expression reaches an extreme negative or positive level at an intermediate time point from which it recovers

3) extreme expression is reached before or after  <dig> minutes.

pcs calculated for hxt-hxt <dig>  had similar features as those for the wild-type strain. in the pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> loadings scatter plot , the pc <dig> still differentiates between induced  and down-regulated  genes. the repressed genes cluster more tightly in the hxt-hxt <dig> strain compared to wild-type, and the cluster also contains adh <dig> and hsp <dig>  which in wild-type had a distinct location. this is because their expression in wild-type initially increases, goes through a maximum  and then decreases. in hxt-hxt <dig> they are instead repressed from start. adh <dig>  which was found close to the cluster of repressed genes in wild-type, is now distant from it having large negative pc <dig> loading. this suggests that its expression is affected in hxt-hxt <dig> such that it goes through a minimum. cyc <dig>  which too has negative pc <dig> score, also goes through a minimum in its temporal expression profile in the hxt-hxt <dig> strain. in addition, the induced genes separate into two subclusters: adh <dig>  tpi <dig> and pdc <dig> in one and pgk <dig>  mig <dig>  adh <dig> and adh <dig> in the other . the separation is mainly along pc <dig>  indicating that the subgroups differ in whether expression goes through  a maximum or if it levels off.

for hxt-tm6* the contribution from noise to the data was larger due to the overall less efficient glucose response and the two main pc's account for only  <dig> % of the total variance. pc <dig> loadings still reflect whether genes are up or down-regulated, while the pc <dig> loadings are less well defined . the repressed genes still form a cluster, with suc <dig> having a somewhat higher pc <dig> score. hsp <dig> is located within the cluster of repressed genes, while adh <dig> and adh <dig>  which were within this cluster in wild-type strain, are separated due to negative pc <dig> loadings and they are now closer to cyc <dig>  the induced genes, but pgk <dig>  form a tight cluster containing also adh <dig>  adh <dig> is found at similar pc <dig> score as the induced genes, suggesting it too has similar expression, although its positive pc <dig> score indicates its expression profile is somewhat shifted in time. pgk <dig> is located around zero loadings for both pc <dig> and pc <dig>  this means that the first two pcs are not very useful to describe its temporal profile and we can only conclude it is different from that of the other induced genes. inspecting the raw data  we find that pgk <dig> expression in hxt-tm6* is essentially unaffected by glucose addition and remains at a constant level.

for the hxt-null  strain the changes in expression upon glucose addition were small, and the pc loadings are quite different from those of the other strains. therefore, the genes' locations in the hxt-null scatter plot cannot be compared to the previous ones. anyway not much remains of the groups seen for the other strains, reflecting the relatively weak response in hxt-null when glucose is added. the most spectacular observation is that mig <dig>  which is a typical glucose-induced gene, is here clearly differentiated from the other glucose induced genes . inspection of the temporal profiles indicates that mig <dig> is the only gene in this group that is still induced upon glucose addition; the expression of the other genes decreases when glucose is added. hsp <dig>  which is repressed after the glucose pulse has previously been reported to be down-regulated at very low glucose concentrations  <cit> , but our results rather suggest that the signal is extracellular. our observation that mig <dig> is still derepressed in hxt-null confirms that it is regulated through extracellular sensing, which previously has been suggested by kaniak et al.  <cit> .

in traditional pca  the pc's are calculated for each strain separately, yielding strain specific score and loading vectors. as consequence, the loadings plots obtained for the different strains cannot be compared easily because the axes have different orientations in the original multidimensional measurement space. this problem is evident when comparing the hxt-null above with any of the other strains: for all the other strains genes induced upon glucose addition are characterized by negative pc <dig> loadings, while for hxt-null induced genes have positive pc <dig> loadings. the reason is that the pc <dig> loading vectors have  opposite orientations in the two cases. to deal with this problem the study must be treated as multiway. while multivariate methods are designed to study one set of samples, characterized by the response of many variables , multiway methods should be used to study several sets of samples, such as the four strains here. one multiway method is matrix-augmented pca  <cit> . in matrix-augmented pca the pre-processed data matrices can be either laminated or catenated . since we here are primarily interested in the genes we catenate the data into an  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix, with the genes as columns and samplings as rows. pca is then performed on the augmented matrix, which produces common score vectors for all strains. these were used to construct the pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> loadings scatter plot in figure  <dig>  in the plot, the genes are color coded as before and the four strains are distinguished by symbols. the hxt-null strain was omitted for clarity. a plot containing also hxt-null is provided in additional data  <dig>  the two main pc's account for 87% of the variability in the catenated data set and the loading vectors have shapes similar to those of the wild-type strain shown in figure 4d. five main areas with genes are seen.

i. pc <dig> <<  <dig>  pc <dig> ≈ 0; genes induced upon glucose addition.

ii. pc <dig> >>  <dig>  pc <dig> ≈ 0; genes repressed upon glucose addition.

iii. pc <dig> ≈ 0; pc <dig> >> 2; genes with expression profiles that go through a maximum.

iv. pc <dig> ≈ 0; pc <dig> << 2; genes with expression profiles that go through a minimum.

v. pc <dig> ≈ 0; pc <dig> ≈ 0; genes with no regulation upon glucose addition.

most of the adh <dig>  pgk <dig>  tpi <dig>  pdc <dig> and mig <dig> genes are found in area i, indicating they are induced upon glucose addition. exceptions are pgk <dig> and mig <dig> in the hxt-hxt <dig> strain, which go through a maximum, and pgk <dig> in hxt-tm6*, which shows no response. most fbp <dig>  adh <dig>  mdh <dig> and suc <dig> genes are in area ii. exceptions are suc <dig> in wild-type, where it shows a local minimum in the temporal profile, and in hxt-tm6*, where it shows a transient induction similar to that observed in growing cells close to glucose depletion  <cit> . the less well understood adh3- <dig> genes show the following behavior: adh <dig> and adh <dig> are found in areas i and iii co-localized with genes induced by glucose, while adh <dig> and adh <dig> are found in areas ii and iv co-localized with genes repressed by glucose. hence, we conclude this is their general response to glucose. several of the adh3- <dig> genes in some strains have pc <dig> scores significantly different from zero indicating that their temporal profiles may go through local minima/maxima. to verify these conclusions the entire experiment was repeated and analyzed separately by matrix-augmented pca . only small differences in scores were seen and the genes were grouped the same way as in figure 5

confirmation with hierarchical clustering and kohonen self-organizing maps
while pca is a very robust approach to classify samples based on multivariate and multiway measurements and an excellent tool to unravel variable patterns, there are also other techniques for unsupervised clustering. the most common is hierarchical clustering although, recently, the kohonen self-organizing map  is gaining attention. while pca always yields the same unbiased result for a certain set of data, hierarchical clustering requires the user to select a distance or similarity measure and also to define how distances between groups shall be measured. once these decisions are made, hierarchical clustering also gives the same result every time for certain data. som, on the other hand, is based on a particular type of artificial neural networks that can be used to create an organized map of expression profiles by treating the raw information in the experimental data using a chain of successive comparisons. the goal is to create a map where adjacent areas correspond to similar samples, alternatively to genes with similar expressions. a som consists of an array of unconnected artificial neurons. there are several options to organize them but in most cases they are arranged in a convenient square so that each neuron is adjacent to other neurons . the underlying idea is to assign sets of neurons  to a distinct class of samples. this is achieved through an iterative process. briefly, each neuron in the map is defined as a set of weights  that equals the number of variables, in this case temporal profiles, measured for each gene  <cit> . hence, the weight vectors can be interpreted as artificial expression profiles. creating the som consists of adjusting the weights of the neuron during a training phase. first the map is initiated by assigning small random numbers to the weights. then a gene is selected randomly and its measured temporal expression profile is compared to the weights of the som's neurons. the neuron with the most similar weights is identified and information about the gene's expression profile is added to its weights. furthermore, the information is also added to the neighboring neurons. the process is then repeated with a new gene over and over until a stable som is obtained. this som will have neurons with weights that reflect all genes' expression profiles and weights of neighboring neurons will be similar. in a final step each gene is placed in the neuron of the som that has the most similar weight to its temporal profile. as a consequence genes with similar profiles will be found in the same neuron or in close-lying neurons.

the possible advantages of hierarchical clustering and som when compared to pca are that the former methods are intuitive and use all the information in the data, while pca is based on coordinate transformation and reduction of dimensionality, which are less obvious operations and also always loses some of the variability in the measured data. the loss of limited amount of information is usually not serious, at least if the first 2– <dig> pcs have large eigenvalues and, hence, account for a large percentage of the total variation. in fact, reduction of dimensionality may lead to improved signal to noise ratio in the measured data, since biological variability is systematic and is mainly contained in the initial pcs, while experimental noise is random and dominates the pcs that are discarded  <cit> . a disadvantage of hierarchical and kohonen-som clustering is that they only yield groups, and any further biochemical interpretation has to be extracted studying the original data matrices, while in pca there is a relation between the measured data and the scores and loadings.

there are two strategies to design som. a fairly large som, typically of dimension n × n, with n being the number of genes, can be used. in such som genes are sparse and only rarely is more than one gene found in one neuron. there are no clear boundaries between groups, because the som surface changes irregularly and distances between the genes are not proportional to the differences between them. still, genes with similar expressions will be close to each other in the som, but there will be no space between groups of genes as in the case of pca. this makes it hard to assign new groups and large soms are therefore more suitable to validate previous classifications based on pca and hierarchical clustering. the alternative is to use a small som, with a rather small number of neurons. this forces the genes to cluster in the few neurons available, thereby creating groups. testing different parameters for the generation of soms and classification of the autoscaled catenated wild-type, hxt-hxt <dig> and hxt-tm6* data, we found that a  <dig> ×  <dig> som gave highly reproducible groupings, independent of the learning rate and the number of neighbors. figure  <dig> shows the groups formed in such som based on a learning rate of  <dig> ,  <dig> neighbors and  <dig> iterations. the groups agree very well with the pca classification. in cell  we find cyc <dig>  adh <dig> from hxt-tm6* and hxt-hxt <dig>  adh <dig> from hxt-tm6* and wild-type suc <dig>  these are the genes found in the bottom left of the pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> loadings scatter plot . cell  contains only pgk <dig> in hxt-tm6*, which was concluded above to have aberrant expression profile both by pca and hierarchical clustering. in cell  we find the glucose induced genes and adh <dig> in hxt-tm6* that in the loadings scatter plot are found at negative pc <dig> and a pc <dig> around zero. cell  contains most of the glucose-repressed genes, hsp <dig> in hxt-tm6* and hxt-hxt <dig>  adh <dig> in hxt <dig> and wild-type, and adh <dig> in wild-type, which in the pca loadings scatter plot are found at positive pc <dig>  and slightly positive pc <dig>  cell  contains hsp <dig> from wild-type, suc <dig> from hxt-tm6* and adh <dig> from hxt-hxt <dig>  in the pca loadings scatter plot, hxt-tm6* suc <dig> and wild-type hsp <dig> are also close to each other at positive pc <dig> and a pc <dig> around zero. adh <dig> in hxt-hxt <dig> is also in this region, although it is closer to another group of genes that in the som is found in unit . these are adh <dig> in all three strains, adh <dig> in wild-type, and mig <dig> and pgk <dig> in hxt-hxt <dig>  the same genes are found in the top left corner of the pc <dig> vs. pc <dig> loadings scatter plot.

classifications by pca, hierarchical clustering, and som are based on quite different assumptions and mathematical models, which makes the methods complementary. hierarchical clustering and som create groups based on some measure of similarity between the samples, which is calculated directly from the experimental data. additional criteria are required to construct groups  or define regions for groups . in contrast, pca is based on the variables and its main objective is to reveal patterns by calculating a set of abstract factors . the number of pcs is much lower than the number of variables, which makes interpretation easier. it eliminates most of the random variation but also some systematic, biologically relevant, information may be missed. som takes account of all variation in the data, but at the expense of not having a linear scale. this makes som more suitable for validation than first hand classification. hierarchical clustering creates clusters sequentially by inspecting subpopulations of the data. once a sample is entered into a group it cannot be extracted again . hence, even though all information in the measurement is considered, it is not considered all at once. therefore, the final clusters may depend on subtle differences between samples' expression profiles. for this reason results of hierarchical clustering should be confirmed by an independent method. for the data presented here and also for the independent replicated experiment in additional data  <dig>  classifications by pca, hierarchical clustering and som are highly consistent, suggesting that the conclusions reached based on the results are valid.

CONCLUSIONS
the yeast multiway expression profiles, based on the expression of  <dig> genes of interest measured at eight time points in fours strains, analyzed catenated by the three analytical methods principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and self-organized maps yield highly consistent results. the genes can be divided into four groups  characterized by different combinations of the two main loading vectors of the pca, they form four hierarchical clusters, and they separate in a som with small number of neurons. pgk <dig> in hxt-tm6* strain falls outside these groups in all analyses, indicating it has a distinct expression profile. a further noteworthy observation is that the responses of mig <dig>  pgk <dig> and suc <dig>  in agreement with our previous study  <cit> , depend on the glycolytic rate. the previously rather unknown adh3- <dig> genes and also hsp <dig>  respond to glucose stimuli. hsp <dig> is strongly repressed also in a strain depleted of all glucose transporters, which suggests that hsp <dig> senses extracellular glucose. adh <dig> and adh <dig> are transiently stimulated by glucose, although neither has been reported to participate in ethanol production  <cit> . adh <dig> and adh <dig> are repressed in a seemingly glycolytic rate dependent manor . the detailed temporal expression profiles are quite different in the different strains but our results suggest that there is a fine-tuning regulatory mechanism for the adh3- <dig> genes that involves glucose. finally, as the regulation of the adh <dig>  adh <dig> and pdc <dig> genes remain the same in all strains capable of glucose metabolism our study confirms that the differences in ethanol production between the strains is not regulated at the ethanol production branch.
