BACKGROUND
environmental sustainability and fossil fuel supply concerns have caused increased focus and research activity in the area of alternative fuel production. the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei  has been used for cellulase production over many decades, and the release of the complete genome sequence facilitates studies that will extend our understanding of how cellulases are regulated in this organism. this understanding may present further opportunities for targeted gene manipulation to increase cellulolytic enzyme production. in the presence of glucose and other easily metabolised carbon sources, genes encoding cellulase enzymes are not highly expressed, even when inducer is present, due to carbon catabolite repression . an industrially important cellulolytic strain of t. reesei, rut-c <dig>  was selected for improved cellulase production following multiple rounds of mutagenesis and selection. the rut-c <dig> genome contains a mutation in the gene encoding a transcriptional repressor involved in carbon catabolite repression, cre <dig>  <cit> . many other mutations have also been identified in rut-c <dig>  <cit> , and those analysed after identification by array comparative genomic hybridization, including an  <dig> kb deletion containing  <dig> genes, do not affect cellulase production  <cit> . these studies show that mutagenesis and selection lead to many off target genetic changes, and some of these may be undesired. a complete understanding of the complex regulation of cellulose metabolism may open up the opportunity for precise targeted genetic manipulation of t. reesei strains for increased cellulase production.

genetic analysis in the model filamentous fungus, aspergillus nidulans, has provided a framework for the study of the mechanism of carbon repression in t. reesei. in a. nidulans there are three genes in which mutations have been identified resulting in partial deregulation of carbon repression: crea, the a. nidulans orthologue of cre <dig>  encoding a zinc finger dna binding transcriptional repressor  <cit> ; creb, encoding a ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase  <cit> ; and crec, encoding a wd <dig> repeat protein shown to be present in a complex with creb  <cit> . orthologues of crea have been identified and studied in numerous fungi including a. niger  <cit> , humicola grisea  <cit> , cochliobolus carbonum  <cit> , gibberella fujikuroi  <cit>  and botrytis cinerea  <cit> , however creb and crec orthologues remain largely unstudied in other fungi. mutations in the creb and crec genes lead to partial deregulation of carbon repression of some genes, and affect the expression of other genes, but they do not cause the severe morphological impairment caused by crea mutations  <cit> . in a. nidulans there is evidence that crea is a direct target of creb suggesting that creb functions in carbon repression via crea  <cit> . disruption of carbon source mediated repression without severe morphological impairment could potentially lead to the development of industrially useful fungal strains, and as such creb represents a candidate for targeted disruption.

the deletion of cre <dig> within the progenitor strain of t. reesei, qm 6a, has recently been characterised  <cit> . as with a. nidulans strains containing crea mutations, the deletion of cre <dig> in this non mutated background resulted in higher total secreted protein and enzymatic activity of endoglucanases and xylanases, as well as morphological impairment. cellulase regulation in t. reesei has also been shown to involve transcriptional regulators including the transcriptional repressor ace <dig>  <cit> , and the transcriptional activators and ace <dig>  <cit>  and xyr <dig>  <cit> . it has recently been shown that xyr <dig> transcription is repressed by cre <dig>  and it was proposed that ace <dig> might also play a role in xyr <dig> repression  <cit> . deletion of xyr <dig> in t. reesei resulted in loss of transcription of the major cellulase encoding genes, cbh <dig>  cbh <dig> and egl <dig>  <cit> , and furthermore there was no secreted cellulase or xylanase activity detected in the xyr <dig> deletion strain after  <dig> hours growth in inducing conditions  <cit> . xyr <dig> has also been implicated in the expression of egl <dig>  <cit>  and the induction of the lactose metabolism pathway by lactose  <cit> .

we find no sequence similar to ace <dig> in the a. nidulans genome, highlighting the differences between regulation of the cellulases in the two filamentous fungi. in this study we have shown bioinformatically that the t. reesei genome contains orthologues of the a. nidulans creb and crec genes. there have been no reports of mutations in creb and crec orthologues in t. reesei, and it was possible that mutations in the t. reesei orthologues of creb or crec may not result in the equivalent phenotypes seen in a. nidulans, as regulation of cellulase encoding genes in t. reesei could have been independent of the creb/crec complex. we have cloned the cre <dig> gene and shown that it is a functional orthologue of the a. nidulans creb gene. a t. reesei strain containing a disruption within the cre <dig> encoding region was generated and the phenotypic effects analysed.

RESULTS
the t. reesei genome contains homologues of creb and crec
the t. reesei genome was examined to identify potential orthologues of the a. nidulans creb and crec genes. using protein sequences for creb  and crec  from the national centre for biotechnology information website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, tblastn analyses were performed against the t. reesei translated nucleotide database http://genome.jgi-psf.org/trire2/trire <dig> home.html. both the identified genomic regions and deduced protein sequences of the t. reesei creb and crec orthologues, designated cre <dig>  and cre <dig>  were aligned to the a. nidulans orthologues using the geneious software package . the cre <dig> amino acid sequence showed 43% identity to a. nidulans creb , while the cre <dig> sequence showed 48% identity to a. nidulans crec.

cre <dig> is a functional orthologue of creb
an a. nidulans strain that contained the ribob <dig> and creb <dig> mutations was transformed with ppl <dig> containing ribob+, with ptrcre <dig>  containing t. reesei cre <dig> also present in the transformation mix. the creb <dig> mutation leads to a pleiotropic phenotype, including sensitivity to allyl alcohol in the presence of glucose and poor utilisation of proline. six riboflavin independent transformants were tested for co-transformation of ptrcre <dig> via complementation of these creb <dig> phenotypes . transformants t <dig> and t <dig> were morphologically similar to wildtype , and also showed complementation of the phenotypes caused by creb <dig> of sensitivity to allyl alcohol in the presence of glucose , and poor proline utilisation. t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> showed varying degrees of partial complementation, possibly due to differences in expression levels due to copy number or position of integration affects, but these were not studied further as the aim was to show that cre <dig> had the same function as creb, rather than a complete analysis of the transformants. thus the t. reesei cre <dig> gene is a functional orthologue of creb, and cre <dig> can be expressed in a. nidulans from the t. reesei cre <dig> promoter.

generation of a cre <dig> disruption strain
a plasmid, ptrcre2Δamds, was constructed to disrupt cre <dig> in t. reesei, in which the a. nidulans amds gene containing the amdsi <dig> promoter mutation was inserted into the cre <dig> orf disrupting the gene within the ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase domain. the position of the insertion of the a. nidulans amds encoding region is indicated in figure  <dig>  between tyr <dig> and his <dig>  which is prior to the essential active sites of the ubiquitin hydrolase domain, his <dig> and asp <dig>  <cit> , and thus this insertion will create a non-active allele. a strain containing a disruption of the endogenous cre <dig> gene, jktr2- <dig>  was generated by transformation of qm 6a with this plasmid. after purification, homologous recombination at the cre <dig> locus, required for disruption of the orf, was verified using southern analysis.

meiotic segregation of the disruption phenotype with the amdi <dig> phenotype
with the recent discovery of strains of opposite mating type  <cit> , meiotic crossing can be performed in t. reesei. the disruption construct contains the amdi <dig> selection marker, and this can be followed in a genetic cross through scoring the strong growth on acrylamide. to provide evidence that the phenotypes observed were due to the disruption and not a fortuitous change elsewhere in the genome, jktr2- <dig> was crossed to cbs <dig> , a strain shown to undergo sexual reproduction with qm 6a  <cit> . the pleiotropic phenotype attributed to cre <dig> disruption always segregated with the amdi <dig> phenotype in the progeny of a sexual cross. of  <dig> progeny screened,  <dig> grew on acrylamide due to the amdi <dig> marker and all  <dig> also showed the pleiotropic phenotype. this segregation of the cre <dig> disruption phenotype with the amdi <dig> marker shows that the pleiotropic phenotype seen in the disrupted strain segregates together and is not due to fortuitous changes elsewhere in the genome.

phenotypic effects of cre <dig> disruption on mycelial growth
jktr2- <dig> showed similar mycelial growth but slightly reduced conidiation compared to qm 6a on solid minimal media with glucose as the carbon source, and considerably stronger mycelial growth and conidiation compared to the cre <dig> deletion strain on this medium . jktr2- <dig> grew much better than qm 6a on solid medium containing maltose , a phenotype linked to increased α-glucosidase activity that has also been shown for a. nidulans strains containing creb mutations  <cit> , whereas the t. reesei cre <dig> deletion strain grew very poorly on this medium. qm 6a and jktr2- <dig> grew similarly when cellobiose was the sole carbon source, suggesting limited effects on β-glucosidase activity . jktr2- <dig> showed poorer growth than qm 6a or the cre <dig> deletion strain on medium containing proline as the sole nitrogen source , a phenotype also seen with a. nidulans creb mutant strains. however, unlike creb mutations in a. nidulans which also grow poorly on lactose, jktr2- <dig> had no discernable effect on lactose utilization in solid medium  but effects were apparent in liquid conditions . jktr2- <dig> also had higher protease activity than qm 6a on medium containing 5%  liquid soy milk, as assessed by the size of the cleared zone around the colonies, but not when 1% glucose was also present in the medium.

growth tests were also performed in 50ml shake flask culture. dry biomass weights were determined for a range of carbon sources for each of the three strains . jktr2- <dig> had significantly  less biomass than qm 6a on glucose at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, but significantly  more than the cre <dig> disruption. solid media growth tests indicated greatly improved growth on maltose for jktr2- <dig> and extremely poor growth for the cre <dig> disruption, which was corroborated in the liquid culture experiments. jktr2- <dig> had three times more biomass than qm 6a at  <dig> hours post inoculation while the cre <dig> disruption failed to grow. analysis of liquid cultures showed that disrupting cre <dig> reduced growth on lactose relative to qm 6a, a result that reflects the phenotype of creb mutations in a. nidulans but that was not detectable for the t. reesei mutation on solid medium. the disruption of cre <dig> or cre <dig> had no noticeable effect in medium with 2% glycerol as the sole carbon source, and both strains had similar amounts of biomass compared to qm 6a. the growth of jktr2- <dig> on 2% sorbitol was very similar to qm 6a, while the cre <dig> disruption grew very poorly.

effects of cre <dig> disruption on cellulase activity
sophorose as inducer
in a preliminary experiment, total secreted cellulase activity was assayed in  <dig> ml shake cultures in medium containing glucose as a repressing carbon source and sophorose as an inducer. when glucose was present, jktr2- <dig> and the cre <dig> deletion strain showed high levels of secreted cellulase activity after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours, whereas qm 6a had limited cellulase activity after  <dig> and  <dig> hours, but the activity had increased to levels similar to the disruption strains by  <dig> hours. glucose levels were determined in qm 6a culture media using hplc, and were  <dig> % at  <dig> hours and 0% at  <dig> hours, and thus by  <dig> hours the cultures contained no source of repression. when sorbitol, a nonrepressing carbon source, replaced glucose, jktr2- <dig> showed higher cellulase activity than either qm 6a or the cre <dig> deletion strain at all time points . these experiments indicated that cre <dig> had an effect on cellulase expression, but the small culture volumes , absence of accurate mycelia mass, and complications in dissecting effects on repression from those on uptake of sophorose  <cit>  made interpretation difficult. based on these preliminary observations, we undertook further experiments in larger volumes using two inducers, lactose, the catabolism of which is initiated by extracellular hydrolysis, thus reducing the effects of inducer exclusion, and microcrystalline cellulose .

lactose as inducer
in experiments using lactose as the inducer, strains were grown in  <dig> ml shake cultures, which allowed accurate measurement of mycelial dry weights to determine activity per gram dry weight. there was little cellulase activity detected in any of the strains tested in glucose , sorbitol  or glycerol  media without added inducer. in medium containing both glucose and lactose as inducer, for qm 6a, cellulase activity was not detected as the cellulase encoding genes are subject to glucose repression. in the cre <dig> deletion strain, cellulase activity was detected consistent with previous work indicating that at least one major exocellulase was not subject to carbon repression in the cre <dig> deletion strain . in jktr2- <dig> there was no detectable cellulase activity until the  <dig> hour time point in 2% lactose and glucose indicating very modest levels of derepression . after  <dig> hours glucose concentrations in the cultures had dropped to  <dig> % for qm 6a and  <dig> % for jktr2- <dig>  but no activity could be detected in the qm 6a cultures. in medium containing lactose as an inducer, but lacking a repressing carbon source, cellulase activity per gram dry weight was higher in jktr2- <dig> compared to qm 6a across all three time points, particularly at  <dig> hours .

total secreted xylanase activity was also measured in 2% glucose, 2% glucose/2% lactose and 2% lactose cultures. as with the cellulase assays, jktr2- <dig> showed elevated total activity by weight when compared to qm 6a on 2% lactose .

microcrystalline cellulose as inducer
since elevated expression was observed with lactose as an inducer after  <dig> hours induction, we also tested this time point using avicel and carboxy methyl cellulose as inducers. we grew  <dig> ml cultures of qm 6a and jktr2- <dig> for  <dig> hours in media containing  <dig> % avicel, with or without 1% glucose. in both qm 6a and jktr2- <dig> there was no detectable cellulase activity in any of the cultures containing glucose. in the cultures containing inducer without repressor, there was significantly more cellulase activity per gram dry-weight mycelium in jktr2- <dig> compared to qm 6a . we also grew  <dig> ml cultures of qm 6a and jktr2- <dig> for  <dig> hours in media containing  <dig> % carboxymethyl cellulose, with or without 1% glucose, but in these culture conditions, carboxymethyl cellulose did not induce any cellulase that was detectable using the enz-chek cellulase assay substrate as the detection system. because carboxy methyl cellulase has been detected in these conditions previously, we assume that this is due to a limitation of the detection substrate.

discussion
the t. reesei cre <dig> amino acid sequence is conserved with a. nidulans creb, particularly within the region encoding the ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase domain, and complementation of the pleiotropic phenotype of the a. nidulans creb <dig> mutant by the t. reesei cre <dig> gene showed it is a functional orthologue of creb. the effects of creb on carbon catabolite repression and the effects on the regulation of permeases are proposed to operate via separate mechanisms, and thus the complementation of the range of phenotypes indicates that both functions are conserved between the two orthologues.

while it is not uncommon for filamentous fungal genes expressed from their endogenous promoters to function in other fungal species, such as the amds gene encoding acetamidase  <cit> , creb forms part of a large complex with crec  <cit> , and is likely to require multiple protein-protein interactions for its functions. therefore the complementation of the creb <dig> mutation by cre <dig> is of importance as it demonstrates that the creb/crec complex previously identified in a. nidulans, and also the targets of creb deubiquination, are conserved between distant filamentous fungi despite relatively low conservation outside of the ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase domain.

we made a cre <dig> disruptant strain using molecular genetic techniques, and the phenotype of the disruptant is consistent with published phenotypes of creb mutations in a. nidulans. we used both southern analysis and meiotic crossing to show that the cre <dig> disruption was the result of a double cross over event at the cre <dig> locus, and that the phenotype was due to the cre <dig> disruption and not to a fortuitous alteration to the genome that occurred in the transformation. the discovery of a sexual cycle in t. reesei  <cit>  allows for the first time traditional genetic analysis of industrial strains, allowing alternatives to molecular approaches. in this case, a meiotic cross was used to demonstrate that the selectable marker phenotype and the cre <dig> disruption phenotype co-segregate, thus strengthening that the disruption phenotype was due to the cre <dig> disruption and not to a fortuitous alteration to the genome.

growth testing on both solid and liquid media revealed similar phenotypes between t. reesei and a. nidulans strains containing cre2/creb mutations. these growth tests support the initial hypothesis that a strain with disrupted cre <dig> will lack the extreme morphological impairment of cre <dig> mutants, although the disruption of cre <dig> does lead to somewhat impaired growth on glucose and lactose, evident in liquid culture.

in the absence of glucose, disruption of cre <dig> leads to elevated cellulase activity whether sophorose, lactose or microcrystalline cellulose was used as an inducer, but not when a source of induction was absent, and this elevated cellulase activity in induced conditions is a robust phenotype of the cre <dig> disruption. when glucose is also present with an inducer, disruption of cre <dig> leads to only a very slight relaxation of glucose repression compared to qm 6a, however this derepression is much less than that due to disruption of cre <dig> 

a full description of the functional roles of creb has yet to be determined, even in a. nidulans. the creb protein has been shown to be a functional deubiquitinase in an e. coli assay , and its direct effect on permeases have been shown for the quinate permease , and effects on permeases are likely to account for the reduced growth on some sole carbon sources. in addition to these effects on growth in various carbon sources, the a. nidulans creb mutations also lead to carbon catabolite derepression of a number of enzyme activities in the presence of a source of repression, including alcohol dehydrogenase induction by ethanol which requires no permease. thus the full range of pleiotropic phenotypes are unlikely to be accounted for solely by effects on permeases. the range of phenotypes due to lack of function mutations in a. nidulans , aspergillus oryzae  and t. reesei orthologues are broadly similar, and thus the functions are likely to be conserved across these organisms. the effects on the induction of activities of enzymes found to be elevated in mutations in a. nidulans and a. oryzae involve effects on transcription, and preliminary results indicate that this is likely also to be the case in t. reesei . thus it is likely that creb plays a role in transcriptional regulation, as well as its effects on the stability of permeases.

since the disruption of cre <dig> increases the amount of cellulase activity without the severe morphological deficiencies seen with the cre <dig> disruption, targeting creb orthologues for disruption in other industrially useful filamentous fungi, such as a. oryzae, trichoderma harzianum or a. niger may also prove beneficial. while the disruption of cre <dig> has increased secreted cellulase activity, further improvements could potentially be made using jktr2- <dig> as a foundation for further targeted genetic manipulation. examples of potential manipulations include making a cre <dig> cre <dig> double null strain, and the over expression of the t. reesei orthologue of cred  <cit> , shown in a. nidulans to increase derepression in a creb null background . protease encoding genes have previously been targeted for disruption to improve heterologous protein expression in both a. oryzae  <cit>  and a. niger  <cit> . t. reesei proteases could also be targeted in these strains to potentially improve extracellular cellulase activity.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified and disrupted the cre <dig> gene in t. reesei, and shown that it is the functional homologue of the creb gene in a. nidulans. the disrupted strain shows a similar phenotype to the equivalent a. nidulans mutant. we have shown that the disruption of cre <dig> increases the amount of cellulase activity in the presence of an inducer, without severe morphological affects. therefore, we propose that targeting creb orthologues for disruption in other industrially useful filamentous fungi, such as a. oryzae, t. harzianum or a. niger may also lead to elevated hydrolytic enzyme activity in these species, and we are presently investigating these possibilities.
