BACKGROUND
the gram-negative obligate anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, in subgingival dental plaque, has been strongly implicated in the onset and progression of chronic periodontitis, a disease characterized by the destruction of the tooth supporting  tissues  <cit> . there is increasing evidence that p. gingivalis is also associated with systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis  <cit>  and preterm birth  <cit> . p. gingivalis is an asaccharolytic organism that relies on the catabolism of amino acids for energy production and growth  <cit> . an array of virulence factors has been associated with p. gingivalis pathogenicity, including proteases, adhesins, fimbriae and capsular polysaccharide  <cit> . the persistence of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque for periods sufficiently long enough to elicit disease is inherently dependent on it surviving as part of a mature biofilm. although mutational analyses have been employed to study genes associated with biofilm development by p. gingivalis  <cit> , very little is known about the nature of p. gingivalis physiology and the crucial regulatory processes occurring in the mature p. gingivalis biofilm and how this relates to pathogenicity. in our laboratory we have devised a reproducible continuous culture method to grow biofilm and planktonic cells simultaneously in the same fermentor vessel. using this approach we have compared the cell envelope proteome of p. gingivalis w <dig> biofilm and planktonic cells  <cit> . in this current study, we have expanded our investigation of these cells, comparing the global gene expression within p. gingivalis biofilm and planktonic cells using microarray analysis.

methods
continuous culture conditions and biofilm formation
the growth and physical characterization of the biofilm and planktonic cells analysed in this study have been described in ang et al.  <cit> . the continuous culture system allows the simultaneous co-culture of planktonic cells and biofilm cells under identical growth conditions  <cit> . briefly, the methods used were as follows. to produce biofilm and planktonic cells for rna harvest p. gingivalis was grown in continuous culture, in duplicate, using a bioflo  <dig> fermentor with a total volume of  <dig> ml  in bhi medium supplemented with  <dig> mg ml- <dig> cysteine hydrochloride and  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> haemin. growth was initiated by inoculating the fermentor vessel with a  <dig> hour batch culture  of p. gingivalis grown in the same medium. after a  <dig> h incubation the media reservoir pump was turned on and the media flow adjusted to give a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  the temperature of the vessel was maintained at 37°c and the ph at  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the culture was continuously gassed with 5% co <dig> in 95% n <dig>  optical density readings  and purity of the culture were analyzed daily. biofilm could be seen to be forming on the fermentor vessel walls and on glass microscope slides that were fixed to the vessel walls. each p. gingivalis w <dig> culture was maintained for  <dig> days until harvesting. planktonic cells were harvested by rapidly pumping them out of the fermentor vessel. the microscope slides were then removed from the fermentor vessel for examination of biofilm thickness and cell viability. the biofilm was rinsed twice with cold pga buffer  <cit>  to remove contaminating planktonic cells and then removed by scraping with a spatula and suspended in cold pga buffer in a  <dig> ml centrifuge tube. pga buffer contained  <dig>  mm nah2po <dig>   <dig>  mm kcl,  <dig>  mm citric acid,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μm cacl <dig>   <dig>  μm zncl <dig>   <dig>  μm mncl <dig>   <dig>  μm cucl <dig>   <dig>  μm cocl <dig>   <dig>  μm h3bo <dig>   <dig>  μm na2moo <dig>   <dig> mm cysteine-hcl with the ph adjusted to  <dig>  with  <dig> m naoh.

biofilm characterization
the viability of cells comprising the biofilms that were on the glass microscope slides were determined using live/dead® baclight™ stain as per manufacturer instructions  with visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy  essentially as described by loughlin et al.  <cit> . clsm was done using an axiovert  <dig> m inverted microscope  fitted with a zeiss lsm  <dig> meta confocal scan head. imaging was carried out using the 458/477/ <dig> nm argon and  <dig> nm hene laser lines and a 63× c-apochromat® water immersion lens. live and dead cells in the stained biofilms were quantified using comstat software  <cit>  with the viability of the biofilm obtained by averaging the number of live cells over the entire z-stack  <cit> . biofilm thickness was also measured using light microscopy  <cit> .

total rna extraction
p. gingivalis w <dig> biofilm and planktonic samples  were immediately added to  <dig>  volume of ice-cold phenol solution . the mixture was centrifuged and the pellet suspended in  <dig> μl of ase lysis buffer  and transferred into a  <dig> ml microcentrifuge tube. an equal volume of ice cold phenol solution was added and the mixture was vortexed for  <dig> s before incubation at 65°c for  <dig> min. the mixture was then chilled on ice for  <dig> min after which of  <dig> μl of chloroform was added and mixed by brief vortexing. the mixture was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g and the aqueous phase collected and extracted using a phenol solution/chloroform  mix. the rna in the aqueous phase was precipitated by addition of  <dig> μl of  <dig> m licl and incubated overnight at -20°c. samples were then thawed and the total rnas were pelleted by centrifugation. the pellet was washed with cold 70% ethanol, air dried and suspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> % diethylpyrocarbonate treated water. the samples were then treated with dnase i  and purified using rneasy mini columns  according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer. the quality of the total rna was verified by analytical agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically.

microarray analyses
reverse transcription reactions contained  <dig> μg of total rna,  <dig> μg of random hexamers, the first strand buffer ,  <dig>  mm each of datp, dctp, and dgtp,  <dig>  mm dttp  and  <dig>  mm aminoallyl dutp ,  <dig> mm dtt, and  <dig> u of superscript iii reverse transcriptase . the reaction mixture was incubated at 42°c for  <dig> h. the rna was hydrolysed by incubation with  <dig>  m edta and  <dig> m naoh at 65°c for  <dig> min and the sample neutralized with  <dig> m hcl before purification of the cdna with qiaquick columns . the cdnas were coupled with monoreactive cy <dig> or cy <dig>   in the presence of  <dig>  m nahco <dig> for  <dig> min at room temperature. the labeled cdnas were purified using qiaquick columns , combined and vacuum dried. samples were then suspended in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 10× ssc ,  <dig> % sds and  <dig> μg μl- <dig> salmon sperm dna.

p. gingivalis microarrays were kindly provided by the institute for genomic research  . each microarray consisted of  <dig> 70-mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate on a glass slide . detailed array information can be viewed at http://www.tigr.org and http://www.brop.org. a total of four slides were used for each planktonic-biofilm pair, where the cdnas were labeled with the alternative dye and hybridized to the microarray slides using a dye-swapping design.

slides were prehybridized at 42°c in 5× ssc,  <dig> % sds and 2% bovine serum albumin for  <dig> h and then briefly rinsed with distilled water and isopropanol. slides were dried by centrifugation for  <dig> min at  <dig>  × g. the labeled cdnas hybridization mix was heated to 100°c for  <dig> min before adding to the dna microarray. each array was covered with a coverslip and placed inside a hybridization chamber . hybridization was carried out in a 42°c water bath for approximately  <dig> h after which the coverslips were removed and the slides washed in 2× ssc,  <dig> % sds at 42°c. the arrays were washed at room temperature once with  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> % sds for  <dig> min, four times for  <dig> min in  <dig> × ssc, and then rinsed with distilled water followed by 100% ethanol. the arrays were dried immediately by centrifugation .

image and data analysis
the hybridized arrays were scanned using an agilent g2565aa microarray scanner system . imagene  <dig>  software  was used for spot finding, signal-background segmentation, and intensity quantification. the intensity of each spot was local background corrected using genesight  <dig>   and the resultant data were log transformed such that the mean value for each channel  had a log ratio of zero. the signal intensities for each dye swap hybridization were combined and the average log ratios were used for all further analysis. the data were normalized using intensity dependent lowess normalization  <cit>  per spot and per slide to remove the intensity-dependent deviation in the log <dig>  values. identification of differentially regulated genes was performed using the genesight  <dig>  confidence analyzer . this statistical analysis uses replicate spots to estimate an empirical distribution of noise. the constructed noise model is then used to determine the statistical measures for the likelihood of false positives above or below a certain expression ratio. the differentially regulated genes were identified at 99% confidence intervals with a cut-off value of log <dig> >  <dig>  or log <dig> < - <dig> . these values correspond to approximately  <dig>  fold up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, a ratio considered biologically relevant  <cit> . the stringent 99% confidence interval was selected to reduce the chance of false positive genes to 1% . all dna microarray work in this study was in compliance with miame guidelines and all data have been deposited under accession number e-tabm- <dig>  in the arrayexpress databases http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress.

validation of microarray data by real time, reverse transcription-pcr
total rna  was reverse transcribed to cdna using superscript iii first strand synthesis supermix  in the presence of random primers  according to the manufacturer's recommendations. real time-pcr was carried out using a rotor-gene  <dig> . the primers for the real-time analysis  were designed using primer <dig> software http://primer <dig> sourceforge.net/. the lengths of the primers were  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides and the amplified products between  <dig> and 130-bp. the amplification efficiency of each primer set was determined empirically by using cdna template dilutions over four orders of magnitude. the amplification efficiency for each primer set varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> %, showing that the amplicons were generated with comparable efficiency.

the real time-pcr reaction contained  <dig>  μl of platinum sybr green qpcr supermix-udg ,  <dig>  μm of each gene-specific primer and  <dig> μl of cdna template. the cycling conditions were 50°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> min, then  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s, 58°c for  <dig> s, and 72°c for  <dig> s. negative controls of distilled water and total rna samples were included in each run. all reactions were carried out in triplicate and melting curve analysis indicated that in each reaction a single product was amplified.

pg <dig> encoding a putative udp-glucose 4-epimerase, gale, was selected as normalizer for all reactions. the critical threshold cycle, ct for each gene was generated by the rotor-gene  <dig> software  and the relative expression ratio of the selected genes calculated and analyzed using the relative expression software tool  http://www.gene-quantification.info <cit> . each real time-pcr reaction was performed using the biological replicate total rna samples that were used for microarray analysis.

RESULTS
p. gingivalis w <dig> growth in continuous culture and biofilm formation
p. gingivalis is a slow growing anaerobe that even in rich media has a generation time of  <dig>  h  <cit> . in the continuous culture system we employed here p. gingivalis w <dig> replicated with a mean generation time of  <dig>  h and reached steady state approximately  <dig> days after inoculation. the cell density of the culture remained constant, after it had reached steady state, at an od <dig> nm of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the first and second biological replicates respectively. robust biofilm was obtained on the vertical surfaces of the fermentor vessel walls and at  <dig> days of culture the planktonic and biofilm cells from the fermentor vessel were harvested for analysis. the glass microscope slides that were fixed to the fermentor vessel walls were used for physical characterization of the biofilm. clsm revealed that the surface of the biofilm featured variable structures and the average percentage of viable cells within the biofilm was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  <cit> . the biofilms were on average  <dig> ±  <dig> μm thick. our continuous culture system allowed us to obtain a direct paired comparison of transcriptomic profiles of both the planktonic and biofilm grown cells that were cultivated in the same fermentor vessel and therefore were subjected to identical gross environmental influences .

identification of genes differentially regulated during biofilm growth
microarray hybridizations were conducted using the paired planktonic cell and biofilm total rna samples obtained from the two independent continuous cultures. for each culture planktonic cell and biofilm pair, four technical replicates of array hybridizations were performed  yielding  <dig> measurements per gene as each gene was represented in quadruplicate on each slide. we designated all genes with an average expression ratio of  <dig> -fold  differentially regulated, a threshold reported to be biologically significant  <cit> . moreover, we used the genesight  <dig>   confidence analyzer to discriminate genes that had a 99% likelihood of being differentially regulated at above or below the  <dig>  threshold.

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were identified to be differentially regulated  between the biofilm and planktonic cells of the first and second replicates respectively . of the identified genes,  <dig> belonged to a common data set . of the  <dig> genes in the common dataset  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . this represents approximately 18% of the p. gingivalis genome.

to validate the microarray data real time-pcr of selected genes pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig> and pg <dig> was performed. six of the genes were selected from the up-regulated group and one from the down-regulated group in biofilm cells. the expression of gale was detected to remain unchanged during biofilm and planktonic growth  and was used for normalization. there was a high correlation between the expression ratios determined by both methods  .

although in some studies the differential expression of only a small percentage of the genome has been suggested following comparison of gene expression in biofilm and planktonic cells  <cit>  differential expression of a large number of genes has been demonstrated in other studies. for example, in escherichia coli, using gene-fusion studies, 38%  underwent altered expression during biofilm development  <cit> . sauer and co-workers demonstrated that more than 50%  of the pseudomonas aeruginosa proteome was differentially regulated between planktonic growth and the fully mature biofilm  <cit> . moreover, dna microarray analysis indicated that up to 22%  of the staphylococcus aureus genome underwent expression changes during mature biofilm growth  <cit> .

factors shown to be relevant to p. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation and heterotypic biofilm formation with streptococccus gordonii include inlj, an internalin family-related protein  <cit> , the minor fimbrial protein mfai  <cit> , clpxp  <cit>  and the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase ltp <dig>  <cit> . in the sequenced p. gingivalis strain w <dig>  <cit>  and in our laboratory strain w <dig>  the mfa <dig> gene encoding mfa <dig> has been interrupted by an insertion of the mobile element ispg <dig>  the microarray data indicated that in strain w <dig> biofilm cells there was increased expression of pg <dig> which is the 5-prime region of mfa <dig>  thus there is an indication that in p. gingivalis strains where mfa <dig> is intact and mfa <dig> produced that the minor fimbrillin may be upregulated in a biofilm. p. gingivalis coaggregation with s. gordonii mediated by mfai is suggested to be relevant to p. gingivalis host colonizaton  <cit> . increased mfa <dig> production may in some strains improve host colonization, but for strains such as w <dig> it would not play a role in their pathogenesis. differential expression of the genes encoding inlj  and clpxp  was not observed in the current study.

the predicted cellular roles of the differentially regulated p. gingivalis gene products in this study encompass widespread functional categories . however, 40%  of the up-regulated genes and 31%  of the down-regulated genes were annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. genes encoding proteins with similarity to experimentally identified proteins with unknown functions accounted for about 10% of the differentially expressed genes.

the physiology of the biofilm
the down-regulation of many genes involved in cell envelope biogenesis, biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups and carriers and other cellular processes was observed in this study . similarly, many genes involved in energy production, dna replication, fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism and central intermediary metabolism were also down-regulated. taken together, these observations suggest a down-turn in cell replication and a slowed growth rate in biofilm cells.

the primary indication of the slowing of cell replication in the biofilm was the down-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in chromosome replication such as dnaa , the primosomal protein n' pria , single-stranded binding protein ssb , the dna polymerase iii alpha subunit dnae  and the dna polymerase iii beta subunit dnan. also down-regulated in biofilm cells were genes encoding homologues of proteins involved in dna repair and recombination, muts  <cit>  , rada  <cit>   and recn  <cit>  . the biofilm cells also displayed up-regulation of a putative translational regulator, recx  that in e. coli has been shown to inhibit reca activity which is important in homologous recombination and in the sos pathway of dna repair and mutagenesis  <cit> .

the down-regulation of a significant number of genes associated with cell envelope biogenesis  also suggests that the growth rate was reduced in biofilm cells. the slower growth rate of cells in a biofilm has been previously attributed to restricted penetration of nutrients and helps explain the relative resistance of biofilms to antibiotics targeting growth  <cit> . as biofilm cells exhibit a slower growth rate then the need for energy would decrease correspondingly. indeed, the transcriptomic data showed that expression of seven genes involved in the glutamate catabolism pathway, one of the key sources of energy for p. gingivalis  <cit> , were simultaneously down-regulated in biofilm cells. one down-regulated gene in this pathway was pg <dig> which is predicted to encode the alpha subunit of 2-oxoglutarate oxidoreductase, an enzyme located at the branching point in this pathway between butyrate and propionate end-products. three genes pg <dig>  pg <dig> and pg <dig> encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase, the coenzyme a transferase beta subunit and acyl-coa dehydrogenase  respectively, that are in the pathway branch that produces butyrate, were down-regulated, as were a cluster of genes encoding a methylmalonyl-coa decarboxylase  that is part of the pathway branch that produces propionate.

signal transduction, regulatory and transcription genes
it has been well established that two-component signal transduction systems  play an important role in biofilm formation in many bacteria, including e. coli  <cit> , enterococcus faecalis  <cit>  and streptococcus mutans  <cit> . interrogation of the p. gingivalis w <dig> orfs revealed only  <dig> putative tcstss. the transcriptomic analysis indicated that one of these tcstss, comprising pg <dig> and pg <dig>  that encode a dna-binding response regulator of the luxr family and a putative sensor histidine kinase respectively, was up-regulated in biofilm cells. to date, the involvement of signal transduction, transcriptional regulators and other transcription factors in p. gingivalis biofilm development has yet to be established.

homologues of the tcstss pg <dig> and pg <dig> have been found in p. gingivalis strain atcc  <dig> and were designated fimr and fims, respectively  <cit> . fimr and fims are known to regulate fima-associated fimbriation  <cit> . comparative transcriptomic profiling of p. gingivalis atcc  <dig> and its fimr deficient mutant indicated only a limited number of genes were part of the fimr regulon including pg <dig>  pg <dig>  and the first gene of the fim locus, pg <dig>  <cit> . binding of fimr upstream of pg <dig> initiates an expression cascade involving pg2131- <dig>  the transcriptomic data presented here do concur with the possible positive regulation of pg <dig> by pg <dig>  however, they are in conflict with the role of pg <dig> in the positive regulation of the fim locus because in strain w <dig> biofilms we observed decreased expression of pg <dig> and pg <dig> with no differential expression of fima. thus, the role of pg <dig> and pg <dig> in p. gingivalis w <dig> biofilm growth may not be reflected in the earlier study of p. gingivalis atcc  <dig> fims and fimr mutants.

it is predicted that there are  <dig> orphan transcriptional regulatory proteins in p. gingivalis but only  <dig> of these were differentially regulated in biofilm cells, one of which was the down-regulated pg <dig>  oxyr. the remaining three possible transcriptional regulators pg <dig>  pg <dig>  and pg <dig> were found to be up-regulated. members of the arac family of transcriptional regulators have been shown to be important in carbon metabolism, stress response and virulence in other species ,  <cit>  and in the regulation of quorum sensing signaling in p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

sigma factors are the subunit of rna polymerase responsible for the recognition of the specific sequence of the target gene promoter  <cit>  and are involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes, particularly virulence  <cit>  and biofilm formation  <cit> . the array data indicated that three putative sigma factors of the σ <dig> family pg <dig> , pg <dig> and pg <dig> were differentially regulated in biofilm cells. both pg <dig> and pg <dig> were up-regulated whilst pg <dig> was down-regulated in biofilm cells. the observed differential expression of these sigma factors in biofilm cells may indicate that these proteins are important regulators of p. gingivalis during biofilm growth.

genes encoding transport and binding proteins
many genes predicted to encode transport and binding proteins were up-regulated in biofilm cells . six of these genes encode components of putative abc transporter systems . pg <dig> and pg <dig> are each predicted to be the inner membrane components of an abc transporter complex, each having an n-terminal transmembrane domain and a c-terminal abc atpase domain. interestingly, a rpsblast search based on the conserved domain database cdd  <cit>  revealed that pg <dig> and pg <dig> encode putative permeases belonging to the family which includes lolc that has been shown to transport lipids across the inner membrane  <cit> .

potential virulence determinants and hypothetical genes
the complete p. gingivalis genome sequence has revealed a number of putative virulence determinants, several of which were highly up-regulated in biofilm cells. these include a putative sialidase  and adp-heptose-lps heptosyltransferase  with an average fold change of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, a putative extracellular protease  and thiol protease, tpr   <cit>  with average fold changes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. we also observed an increased expression of the gene encoding htra, a putative periplasmic serine protease  with an average fold change of  <dig> . htra is known to play a role in biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans  <cit>  and virulence in a variety of bacterial species  <cit> . in p. gingivalis, htra has been shown to confer protection against oxidative stress and be involved in long term adaptation to elevated temperature  <cit> . htra has also been implicated in the modulation of the activity of the gingipain cysteine proteinases at elevated temperature but it is not essential for the maturation or activation of the gingipains under normal conditions  <cit> . interestingly htra occurs in a predicted operon upstream of rpod. in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit>  and yersinia enterocolitica  <cit>  an alternative sigma factor rpoe has been implicated in the regulation of htra and resistance to oxidative stress. taken together, these results suggest that perhaps htra in concert with rpod may be part of a stress response that is activated during p. gingvalis biofilm growth.

the majority of the differentially regulated p. gingivalis genes were of unknown or poorly characterized function. three of the genes encoding the hypothetical proteins, pg <dig>  pg <dig>  and pg <dig> were also amongst the most highly up-regulated genes in biofilm cells with an average fold change of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. rpsblast search indicated that some of the hypothetical p. gingivalis proteins do have similarities to proteins of known function such as hslj, a heat shock protein  and degq, a trypsin-like serine proteases  .

* putative gene description and function were determined using rpsblast.

comparison of our microarray results with the cell envelope proteome analysis of p. gingivalis w <dig> biofilm and planktonic cells performed by ang et al.  <cit> , using the same cells as in this study, indicates that  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins that were of differential abundance in that study correlate with the protein abundances  that could be expected based on our microarray data. while this correlation is modest, it is important to bear in mind that protein cellular distribution, stability, post-translation modifications and/or turnover may result in measured protein abundances that differ from those expected from the transcriptomic data  <cit> . some p. gingivalis proteins known to be associated with the outer membrane and virulence of the bacterium, such as the gingipains , haga and cpg <dig>  that were of differential abundance in the proteome study of ang et al.  <cit>  were not shown to be differentially expressed at the transcript level in this study. one of these proteins, the lys-specific gingipain proteinase kgp  has been shown to be a major virulence factor for p. gingivalis in assimilating the essential nutrient haem  <cit> . in this current study the kgp transcript level was unchanged between planktonic and biofilm growth. however, in the ang et al.  <cit>  study significantly less of the kgp protein was found on the cell surface in the biofilm relative to planktonic cells. kgp, along with other surface proteins, is known to be released from the cell surface by as yet undefined mechanisms to be present in the extracellular environment. hence the transcriptomic and proteomic data from the same cells suggests that a major virulence factor, kgp, may be released from the surface of the biofilm cells with no reduction in expression. this mobilization of a major virulence factor involved in assimilation of an essential nutrient may be an important survival mechanism for p. gingivalis in a biofilm.

it must be noted that the study presented here is of p. gingivalis grown as a monospecies biofilm and not as part of a multispecies biofilm as in subgingival dental plaque. nonetheless the study does provide useful insights into the global events occurring when the bacterium is grown as a biofilm for an extended period, reflective of the chronic infection of the host. analyses of p. gingivalis gene expression when it is grown as part of a multispecies biofilm are currently underway in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown 18% of the p. gingivalis w <dig> genome exhibited altered expression upon mature biofilm growth. despite the intrinsic spatial physiological heterogeneity of biofilm cells we were able to identify a large subset of genes that were consistently differentially regulated within our biofilm replicates. from the downturn in transcription of genes involved in cell envelope biogenesis, dna replication, energy production and biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups and carriers, the transcriptomic profiling indicated a biofilm phenotype of slow growth rate and reduced metabolic activity. the altered gene expression profiles observed in this study reflect the adaptive response of p. gingivalis to survive in a mature biofilm.
