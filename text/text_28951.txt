BACKGROUND
meyerozyma guilliermondii is a genetically heterogenous complex belonging to the saccharomycotina ctg clade  <cit> . this complex consists of phenotypically indistinguishable and closely related species namely meyerozyma guilliermondii , meyerozyma caribbica , candida carpophila, candida smithsonii, candida athensensis, candida elateridarum and candida glucosophila <cit> . apart from its presence in healthy human  <cit> , m. guilliermondii also exists in clinical  <cit>  and environmental samples  <cit> . this organism is widely studied in various aspects due to its clinical importance, biotechnological applications and biological control potential  <cit> .

c. guilliermondii is regarded as an emerging infectious yeast of the non-albicans candida  species group which accounts for  <dig> – 5% of nosocomial blood stream infections worldwide  <cit> . however, in certain geographical regions such as brazil, india and italy, over 10% of all the candidaemia cases are caused by this species  <cit> . the threat posed by this organism is ever increasing due to the decreased susceptibility and emergence of strains resistant to antifungal drugs like polyene  and azoles , leading to mortality in candidaemia patients  <cit> . c. fermentati has been rarely found to be associated with candidaemia  <cit> . but due to the poor discernability of c. fermentati from c. guilliermondii, they are commonly misidentified in clinical laboratories. apart from being organisms of clinical importance, m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica are often linked with fermented foods  <cit> . m. guilliermondii is known for the production of flavour compounds in fermented food products  <cit> . further, in a study with soybean paste fermentation, m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica have been claimed for the efficient production of isoflavone aglycone which is a widely known bioactive compound for its various health promoting functions  <cit> . m. guilliermondii is a flavinogenic yeast which is known for the overproduction of vitamin b <dig>   <cit> . moreover, isolates of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica have exhibited great potential in the biological control of fungi responsible for postharvest spoilage of fruits and vegetables  <cit> . these yeast species with enhanced biological control efficacy have emerged as a potential alternative to the conventional fungicide treatment. considering the various importance and applications of the two species, there is a need for the development of accurate and reliable method to identify and distinctly discriminate the closely related species.

current methods of yeast identification, mostly in clinical practice, are mainly based on the conventional and rapidly evolving commercial phenotypic and biochemical methods. however, such methods are often unreliable for accurate identification of closely related yeast species  <cit> . according to recent studies, m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica are extremely difficult to differentiate by the phenotypic methods  <cit> . we also faced similar problem during differentiation of yeast isolates from soibum, an indigenous fermented bamboo shoot product of north east india . the widely used api  <dig> c aux yeast identification system and sequencing of large subunit  rrna gene d1/d <dig> domain failed to give proper species-level taxonomic assignment to these isolates . moreover, the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the publicly available d1/d <dig> sequences of different strains of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica failed to discriminate the two species .

several attempts have been made using molecular approaches such as dna base composition, electrophoretic karyotyping  <cit> , multi locus sequence typing   <cit> , multi locus enzyme electrophoresis , randomly amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> , sequencing of internal transcribed spacer   <cit> , intergenic spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism   <cit>  and rflp of housekeeping genes such as riboflavin synthetase gene ribo <cit>  in order to resolve the misidentification. some recent studies have claimed that the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  is advantageous over previous approaches for reliable identification of clinically important nac and non-candida yeast species  <cit> . unfortunately, maldi-tof-ms requires reference spectra of accurately identified closely related strains otherwise the results may be erroneous. on the other hand, the sequence-based studies have considered the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> region as universal dna barcode for yeast identification  <cit>  and the rflp of its1- <dig> s-its <dig> region has successfully separated the closely related species in the genera candida and pichia <cit> . therefore, in this study, we targeted the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> region to develop a simple rflp method for accurate taxonomic assignment of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica.

with this background, the aim of the present study was  to perform in silico prediction of restriction enzymes to discriminate m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica using the publicly available its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences,  to evaluate the selected enzymes by in vitro its-rflp analysis of ambiguously identified  <dig> yeast isolates for species-specific taxonomic assignment, and  to validate the taxonomic assignment by its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequencing, mitochondrial dna -rflp and pulsed field gel electrophoresis  karyotyping.

methods
yeast isolates and strains
the yeast isolates used in the present study are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  these isolates were obtained from samples collected at different stages of indigenous bamboo shoot fermentation for the production of soibum in manipur state of north east india  <cit> . the sample  was homogenized in 90 ml of sterile physiological saline  using stomacher®  <dig> circulator  at 250 rpm for 3 min. the yeasts were isolated by serial dilution spread-plating of the above homogenate on yeast extract peptone dextrose  agar medium   containing 100 μg/ml each of filter-sterilized ampicillin and tetracycline , followed by incubation at 30°c for  <dig> − 72 h under aerobic conditions. all the isolates were purified by sub-culturing twice on the same agar medium and preserved at −80°c in yepd broth containing 10%  sterile glycerol . for short term storage, the cultures were maintained at 4°c on yepd agar. the type strain c. guilliermondii atcc  <dig> used for comparison was obtained from american type culture collection.

phenotypic characterization and morphological observation
phenotypic identification of the yeast isolates was carried out using the api  <dig> c aux yeast identification system  following manufacturer’s instructions. colony and cell morphology of the isolates were studied using sz-pt stereo binocular microscope  and bx <dig> phase contrast microscope .

in silico analysis and restriction enzyme selection
the full length its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica were retrieved from ncbi  and centraalbureau voor schimmelcultures  yeast nucleotide databases . type strain sequences of the two species, c. guilliermondii atcc  <dig>  and m. caribbica cbs  <dig>  were subjected to in silico pcr amplification using primers its <dig>  and its <dig>   <cit>  to trim off the untargeted regions on both 5′ and 3′ ends of the sequences using the online sequence manipulation suite . using nebcutter, version  <dig>  , the its amplicon sequences were subjected to in silico restriction digestion using the commercially available type-ii restriction endonucleases listed in the rebase database   <cit>  to select the enzymes which cut the two sequences differently at not more than  <dig> cleavage sites. multiple sequence alignment of  <dig> additional its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences of different strains from different ecological niches for each species was performed using clustal x, version  <dig>   and bioedit, version  <dig> . <dig>  to confirm the taxa-specificity of the selected restriction enzymes.

dna extraction
dna was extracted from pure cultures as cell-free dna lysate using lyticase-heat lysis method. briefly, a single colony of  <dig> − 48 h old culture from yepd agar was inoculated to 5 ml of yepd broth supplemented with antibiotics, and incubated for 18 h at 30°c with shaking at 200 rpm. cells were harvested from 1 ml of the culture broth at  <dig>  g for 5 min . the cell pellet was washed twice with 1 ml sterile  <dig>  m nacl followed by sterile deionized water . the cells were finally resuspended in 500 μl of 1× te buffer  containing 10 μl of lyticase   and incubated at 37°c for 1 h. after the incubation, the spheroplasts were lysed by heating at 95°c for 20 min. the crude cell-free lysate was collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 10 min at 4°c and the dna was quantified spectrophotometrically . the cell-free lysate with absorbance ratio  of  <dig>  −  <dig>  was used for pcr analysis and stored at −20°c until required.

its-rflp
its1- <dig> s-its <dig> was amplified from the cell-free dna lysate using primers its <dig> and its <dig> mentioned elsewhere. the amplification was carried out in a 25 μl final reaction volume containing 50 ng of the genomic dna as previously described  <cit> . the amplified its fragment was analyzed by  <dig> %  agarose gel electrophoresis at 80 v in  <dig> × tbe  buffer to check its intactness and absence of non-specific amplification. the pcr product  was digested with  <dig> u of taqi  in a 10 μl reaction volume at 65°c as per manufacturer’s instructions. the restriction patterns were analyzed by electrophoresis of the 10 μl reaction volume on  <dig> %  agarose gel in parallel with pcr 100 bp low dna ladder  as molecular size standard. the electrophoresis was run at 80 v for 2 h in  <dig> × tbe buffer. the gel was then stained in  <dig>  μg/ml ethidium bromide solution for 30 min with rocking at 15 rpm on a platform rocker . after destaining for 30 min in sterile deionized water, the gel was photographed using chemidoc mp gel documentation system . the restriction fingerprints were analysed for the absence or presence of discriminating fragments using gelcompar ii software, version  <dig>  .

mtdna-rflp
a single colony of  <dig> − 48 h old culture from yepd agar was inoculated to 5 ml of yepd broth supplemented with antibiotics, and incubated for 18 h at 30°c with shaking at 200 rpm. the grown culture was inoculated into 50 ml of fresh yepd broth  and incubated in the above conditions till mid-logarithmic growth phase . cells of  <dig> od <dig> were harvested at  <dig>  g for 5 min at 4°c . the mtdna was extracted as previously described  <cit>  with some modifications. the cells were resuspended and washed with 5 ml of yeast resuspension buffer  and stored at −20°c for 10 min. lyticase   was used to produce spheroplast and 15 μl of 1 mg/ml rnase a solution  was added during cell lysis. the total dna was precipitated at −20°c for 1 h. after quantifying the dna content spectrophotometrically, the dna was freeze dried, re-dissolved in sterile deionized water to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl and stored at −20°c till further use. restriction digestion was carried out on 10 μg of the dna in a 20 μl reaction volume using  <dig> u each of haeiii and hinfi  according to manufacturer’s instructions. the restriction patterns were generated by  <dig> %  agarose gel electrophoresis of the 20 μl reaction volume at 80 v in  <dig> × tbe buffer for 4 h in parallel with 1 kb dna ladder . after staining and documentation, the restriction fingerprints were subjected to cluster analysis using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  algorithm on jaccard similarity coefficients using gelcompar ii. composite data set of the restriction digestion profiles was generated with  <dig> % position tolerance to generate the clustering. bootstrap analysis with  <dig>  replicates was performed to indicate the branch quality.

electrophoretic karyotyping
intact chromosomal dna for electrophoretic karyotyping using pfge was prepared as previously described  <cit> . the electrophoresis was carried out in  <dig> %  pfge-grade agarose gel  and  <dig> × tbe buffer at  <dig> − 14°c and 150 v in contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis apparatus . the gel was run for 22 h with a switch interval of 90 s for 8 h followed by 105 s for 6 h and finally 120 s for 8 h in parallel with pfge marker  from saccharomyces cerevisiae strain yph <dig> . staining and documentation were performed as mentioned elsewhere.

its and d1/d <dig> sequencing and sequence analysis
the representative isolates from each its-rflp genotype group were randomly selected for sequencing its1- <dig> s-its <dig> and lsu rrna gene d1/d <dig> domain. its1- <dig> s-its <dig> was pcr amplified as mentioned elsewhere. amplification of d1/d <dig> region was carried out using primers nl <dig>  and nl <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . the amplified products were purified using nucleospin® extract ii gel extraction kit  following manufacturer’s instructions. the pcr products were sequenced using abi  <dig> genetic analyser  with the same primers used for the amplification. the sequence reads were validated by analysing the electropherogram data using chromaslite software, version  <dig>  . to identify the closest known relatives, the sequences were queried with ncbi and cbs yeast nucleotide databases. the sequences obtained from both sequencing and nucleotide databases were aligned using clustal x algorithm and a neighbour joining tree was constructed by kimura’s evolutionary distance matrix obtained from the multiple sequence alignment using mega <dig> phylogenetic software. bootstrap values for  <dig> replicates were shown at the node of cluster branch. the sequences were deposited to ncbi genbank under the following accession numbers: jf <dig> − jf <dig> and kf <dig> − kf <dig> 

RESULTS
in silico selection of differentiating restriction enzymes
the full length its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica were retrieved from ncbi and cbs yeast nucleotide databases and subjected to multiple sequence alignment followed by in silico restriction digestion. three variable regions differentiating m. guilliermondii from m. caribbica were identified. seven restriction enzymes  which cut the variable regions differently were identified . considering the length and the number of polymorphic fragments with sizes greater than 100 bp , bfai, mmei and taqi were found appropriate. notably, commonly available taqi gave distinct species-specific differentiation between the two species . we also tested the selected three restriction enzymes  for differentiating m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica from other closely related members of m. guilliermondii complex . except c. carpophila and m. caribbica, all other members of m. guilliermondii complex were distinctly differentiated during the analysis.

evaluation of in silico selected restriction enzymes by in vitro its-rflp
to validate the above in silico selection, the  <dig> yeast isolates of m. guilliermondii complex  were analysed by its-rflp using the selected taqi restriction enzyme in comparison with the type strain c. guilliermondii atcc  <dig>  all the tested isolates and the type strain gave a single pcr amplicon of molecular size of 607 bp. as predicted by the in silico analysis, taqi its-rflp distinctly differentiated the isolates into two genotype groups. forty seven isolates produced m. guilliermondii-specific pattern , while the remaining eight isolates generated m. caribbica-specific pattern  . examples of taqi its-rflp profiles differentiating the above two species are shown in figure 1b.

validation of its-rflp assay
the above its-rflp based discrimination of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica was further confirmed by its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequencing, mtdna-rflp fingerprinting and pfge karyotyping . the its sequences of the isolates in each genotype group mg and mc matched with the sequences of the type strains c. guilliermondii atcc  <dig> and m. caribbica cbs  <dig> with  <dig> % and  <dig> % similarity respectively. the sequences between the two groups were 99% identical showing only  <dig> nucleotide differences which were the same as shown by the above type strain sequences. unlike d1/d <dig> region, the its sequences formed distinct cluster of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica during phylogenetic analysis . the its sequences of m. guilliermondii strains px-pat, canr- <dig> and sd 337; m. caribbica strains uclm 44a and iwbt-y <dig> showed  <dig> –  <dig> nucleotide differences which was reflected as divergence within the clusters. the mean evolutionary divergence of  <dig>  between the two clusters was  <dig> times more than the divergence within each cluster.

the mtdna-rflp using haeiii and hinfi distinctly segregated the yeast isolates into m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica. mtdna-rflp profile-based dendrogram formed two clusters  similar to the its-rflp groups. between the two enzymes used, hinfi showed higher polymorphism than haeiii. electrophoretic karyotyping also distinctly discriminated the above two species . the species-specific mtdna-rflp pattern suggested that the isolates of each group belonged to only one strain . whereas electrophoretic karyotyping brought out strain level diversity in both the groups which confirmed that multiple strains of m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica were involved in the indigenous bamboo shoot fermentation .

discussion
in recent times, the frequency of emerging infectious diseases caused by the opportunistic yeast species of nac and non-candida groups has increased in immunosuppressed patients  <cit> . this is linked with the indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antifungal drugs and global climate change  <cit> . most of these closely related yeast species are often misidentified by the conventional phenotypic, biochemical and antibiotic susceptibility methods. thus, accurate identification of these species has become essential for clinical management and effective antifungal therapy.

in the present study, we showed that the developed its-rflp method was reliable and consistent for distinct differentiation of closely related m. guilliermondii from m. caribbica for which phenotypic methods and d1/d <dig> sequencing were inconclusive. our results also indicated that sequencing of both d1/d <dig> and its regions will increase the resolution of species identification which can be further improved by multigene sequence-based phylogenetic approach  <cit> . however, the presence of incorrectly identified, insufficiently annotated and non-updated entries in the public nucleotide databases may underestimate the resolving power of these taxonomic markers  <cit> . out of the  <dig> sequences of lsu rrna gene for m. guilliermondii available in ncbi genbank,  <dig> sequences  clustered with m. caribbica type strain cbs  <dig>  .

the choice of appropriate restriction endonucleases is critical for rflp experiments. the commonly used cfoi, haeiii and hinfi  <cit>  failed to segregate m. guilliermondii from other species of the same genus during in silico and in vitro its-rflp analysis. our results indicated that in silico selection of restriction enzymes using the publicly available sequences from various strains of the target species is a better approach than randomly selecting the previously described and commonly used enzymes. this approach has been proven to be highly effective and reproducible  <cit> , and many online resources have been developed for this purpose  <cit> . clinical isolates of candida famata and candida palmioleophila were also frequently misidentified as m. guilliermondii <cit> . in silico analysis confirmed that the developed its-rflp method can also discriminate these species . this in silico selection approach can be effectively applied to other cryptic yeast species of clinical importance for the development of rflp based diagnostic tools.

the developed method of its-rflp using taqi differentiated m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica at species level. this method is simple, rapid and reliable in comparison to the commonly used sequencing methods. the entire analysis starting from dna extraction to its-rflp profiling can be completed within 8 h. further studies using higher number of strains of these two species from different clinical sources are required to confirm the robustness of this method for diagnostic applications. though the combination of its-rflp profiles generated by taqi, bfai and mmei differentiated other closely related species of the m. guilliermondii complex from m. guilliermondii and m. caribbica during in silico analysis, it is yet to be confirmed through in vitro analysis using reference strains.

in our present study the use of either haeiii or hinfi for mtdna-rflp was sufficient to differentiate the two species, but failed to give strain level differentiation even when both enzymes were used. this demonstrated that mtdna-rflp can also be used for distinct differentiation of closely related species. the hinfi mtdna-rflp pattern of our m. guilliermondii isolates was similar with the mtdna restriction pattern ‘e’ of m. guilliermondii strains isolated from wineries in alentejo, portugal  <cit> . this genotype was linked with the production of flavour compound, 4-ethylphenol in wine. the major phenolic flavour compound  detected from fermented bamboo shoot product, soibum  might also have originated from m. guilliermondii. future study is required to characterize the flavour compound producing strain for starter culture development. though fresh bamboo shoots are highly perishable, the fermented bamboo shoot can be preserved up to one year after fermentation without any deterioration or change in its organoleptic character. this long term preservation may be linked with the dominant presence of m. guilliermondii which has been reported as an efficient biological control agent  <cit> . being an emerging infectious yeast, the presence of m. guilliermondii in fermented food is a great concern regarding the safety of its consumption. further study in strain level is required to unravel the pathogenic potential of m. guilliermondii associated with soibum fermentation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we described an its-rflp method developed through an integrated approach of in silico selection of restriction enzymes and in vitro validations for distinct differentiation of frequently misidentified m. guilliermondii from m. caribbica, which can be used as an alternative or an adjunct to its sequencing. this method may be used for rapid and accurate identification of emerging infectious yeasts of the saccharomycotina ctg clade. this approach can also be used for other closely related species complex when phenotypic methods and d1/d <dig> sequencing are ambiguous.
