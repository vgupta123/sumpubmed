BACKGROUND
lipopolysaccharide  is an essential outer membrane component of gram-negative bacteria. lps is composed of lipid a, core oligosaccharide and the o-antigen polysaccharide chain. lps is highly immunogenic in animals with lps recognition leading to induction of defense responses  <cit> . the loci that encode functions involved in lps biosynthesis show enormous variation across different strains of the same species of animal pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . for example, eleven highly divergent gene clusters were reported to occupy an lps locus in pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic human pathogen  <cit> . this variation is attributed to selection to evade immune responses; in vibrio cholera changes involving lps loci within different strains have been implicated in major epidemics  <cit> . apart from being a pathogen associated molecular pattern , lps also acts as a receptor for bacteriophages, with mutations that cause altered lps resulting in phage resistance  <cit> .

in plant pathogenic bacteria, lps is an important virulence factor  <cit> . lps is also being increasingly recognized as a major pamp for plants  <cit>  inducing expression of plant defense related genes, production of phenolic compounds and an oxidative burst, and suppressing hypersensitive reaction   <cit> . the induction of the nitric oxide synthase  gene is a hallmark of the mammalian immune response and recently, lps has also been shown to induce the nos gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . most of the above studies were carried out in dicot plants, but very recently lps was also shown to induce defense responses and cell death in rice, a model monocot plant  <cit> . all of these findings clearly indicate an important role for lps recognition in plant defense. therefore, as in animal pathogenic bacteria, variation in lps gene clusters might be expected across different strains of plant pathogenic bacteria.

xanthomonas is a large genus of plant pathogenic bacteria that show a high degree of host plant and tissue specificity. one member of this genus, x. oryzae pv. oryzae  causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice. lps is an important virulence factor of xoo  <cit>  and in earlier work, we reported the complete sequence of an lps gene cluster from our laboratory strain, bxo <dig>  <cit> . this gene cluster  was found in a majority of xoo strains examined including two strains  that have been completely sequenced  <cit> . however, this gene cluster was absent in two strains of xoo, bxo <dig>  and nepal <dig>  <cit> . in this paper, we report the complete sequence of the lps gene cluster present in the bxo <dig> strain of xoo. we compare this sequence with that of the lps gene clusters of x. axonopodis pv. citri  and x. oryzae pv. oryzicola . we also report substantial interstrain variation at this locus among three strains of xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris , a destructive pathogen that causes black rot of cabbage and other cruciferous plants, including arabidopsis. a meta-comparison across all examined variants of the lps locus in different xanthomonads revealed relationships and an overall pattern that suggests multiple horizontal gene transfer  events and strong diversifying selection.

RESULTS
genetic organization of an lps biosynthesis locus in the bxo <dig> strain of xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae
the sequence of the lps biosynthetic gene cluster of bxo <dig> was obtained using long range pcr and shotgun sequencing of the pcr amplified product. the sequence was confirmed by resequencing on genomic dna using pcr amplified products obtained with a set of nested primers that spanned the length of the lps locus . the locus is  <dig>  kb and contains seventeen open reading frames  . as in xoo strain bxo <dig>  <cit> , the xoo strain bxo <dig> lps locus is flanked by the genes for cystathionine gamma lyase  at one end and electron transport flavoprotein  at the other end. the size, number of genes encoded, and the organization of the bxo <dig> lps locus are in contrast to the lps locus that is present in xoo strain bxo <dig>  <cit> . the bxo <dig> lps gene cluster is > 99% identical to the  <dig>  kb long, seven gene lps gene cluster of xoo strains kacc <dig>  <cit>  and maff <dig>  <cit> . the overall g+c content of the xoo strain bxo <dig> lps locus is  <dig> % , which is strikingly different from the average genomic g+c content of  <dig> % for xoo, based on the genome sequences of xoo strains kacc <dig>  <cit>  and maff <dig>  <cit> . however, there is variation in g+c content of individual orfs of the bxo <dig> lps gene cluster ranging from  <dig> % for orf <dig> to as high as 63% for orf <dig> 

the list of orfs and their most similar homologs identified using blastx is given in table  <dig>  the first two orfs from the metb side were annotated as putative abc transporter permease  and putative atp binding protein  genes. the start codon of wzt overlaps with the stop codon of wzm. the overlap between the start codon of wzt and the stop codon of wzm also suggests that these two genes are co-transcribed. homologs of wzt and wzm are present in many lps gene clusters. in bxo <dig>  the wzm and wzt genes encode proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids respectively, that show significant similarity to the putative wzm  and wzt  proteins of xac strain  <dig>  orf <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa protein of unknown function. the fourth orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein that shows homology to a putative o-antigen biosynthesis protein encoding gene of xac strain  <dig> . however, blast search revealed that this gene is a truncated copy with most of the 5' region missing, when compared to its homologs from other bacteria . surprisingly all the homologous counterparts of orfs  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exist in the same contiguous order and transcriptional direction in geobacillus stearothermophilus strain nrs 2004/3a  . in the blastx result, both orf <dig> and orf <dig> exhibit homology to different portions of the same protein  encoded by orfg <dig> in gst strain nrs 2004/3a, suggesting the possibility of a frameshift. orf <dig>  which encodes a hypothetical protein, is homologous to a glycosyl transferase in roseovarius sp.  <dig> , acidothermus cellulolyticus 11b , and other bacteria.

a i and s indicate identity and similarity, respectively. e values were obtained by using the blastx algorithm and screening the ncbi database.

the orfs transcribed from the etfa side also exhibit interesting homologies. orf <dig> and orf <dig> encode  <dig> and  <dig> aa proteins respectively. both show very high identity  to proteins  annotated as putative integral membrane proteins in xac strain  <dig>  orf <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa protein and also is homologous to a putative oxidoreductase of xac strain  <dig> . orf <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa protein and is homologous with a putative shortchain dehydrogenase present in xac strain  <dig> . orf <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa long protein homologous with a methyltransferase protein in nocardioides sp. js <dig> . orf <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa long protein homologous with a predicted nad dependent epimerase in xac strain  <dig> . orf <dig> is a  <dig> aa protein and shows homology to a putative phytoene desaturase of xac strain  <dig> . the next three orfs  encode proteins of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> aa, respectively, annotated as putative transmembrane proteins in many bacteria. orf <dig> shows significant homology to the glycosyltransferasea  family of proteins present in dechloromonas aromatica , syntrophobacter fumaroxidans , and other bacteria. orthologs of orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> are present in the lps gene cluster of xac strain  <dig> .

the xoo strain bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig> lps gene clusters are highly similar
the orthologs in xac strain  <dig> of the bxo <dig> lps biosynthetic genes mentioned above reside in a cluster between the conserved metb and etfa genes with overall high similarity to the bxo <dig> lps cluster . the size of the lps locus is similar in both bxo <dig>  and xac strain  <dig> . in both lps gene clusters, the orfs are organized in two convergent transcriptional units. we reannotated the xac strain  <dig> lps locus and identified two new orfs, orf3xac and orf5xac. for all the orfs of the bxo <dig> lps locus, except for orf <dig>  orthologous counterparts exist in xac strain  <dig>  however, there is one minor rearrangement in the bxo <dig> lps gene cluster. orf <dig>  the ortholog of xac <dig>  is present between orthologs of xac <dig> and xac <dig>  instead of after the ortholog of xac <dig>  as in bxo <dig>  the xac lps gene cluster encodes five orfs  homologous to the gene cluster of gst strain nrs 2004/3a. the xac <dig> orf is annotated as a truncated o-antigen biosynthesis protein gene, and both orf <dig> and xac <dig> are homologous to different portions of the same orf  in gst strain nrs 2004/3a. interestingly, there is no homolog of xac <dig> within either the lps gene cluster of bxo <dig> or the gst strain nrs 2004/3a locus.

blast comparisons of the bxo <dig> and xac lps loci using the web-based artemis comparison tool revealed that nucleotide level identity varies for different genes and regions. the first region consisting of orf <dig> to orf <dig> of bxo <dig> exhibits around 63% nucleotide identity to the corresponding region of the xac lps locus. the second region comprising orf <dig> to orf <dig> is most diverged and has around 50% nucleotide identity. the third region comprising orf <dig> and orf <dig> shows around 70% nucleotide identity. the fourth region consisting of orf <dig> to orf <dig> is the least diverged and shows 89% identity at the nucleotide level. pairwise comparison of the orthologous genes in the bxo <dig> and xac lps loci is shown in fig.  <dig>  the percentage of nucleotide identity varies from 38%  to  <dig> % .

the xoc strain bls  <dig> lps gene cluster is chimeric
the lps biosynthetic locus present between metb and etfa in xoc strain bls  <dig> was retrieved from a whole, partially annotated, genome sequence available through the comprehensive microbial resource  <cit> . the locus is  <dig> kb, bigger than the bxo <dig>  and bxo <dig>  lps loci. the sequence of the xoc lps locus was annotated and compared with the corresponding region in bxo <dig> . as in bxo <dig> and xac, the genes in the lps cluster appear to be organized in two blocks that are convergently transcribed. interestingly, in the xoc lps locus, there are two full copies of the is elements isplulb and is <dig> at the junction of these convergently transcribed sets of genes. a copy of the is element is <dig> is also present in the bxo <dig> lps region at the same position . moreover, the block of  genes at the etfa end is orthologous with the xac strain  <dig> and bxo <dig> clusters. however, unlike in bxo <dig>  there is no rearrangement of the homolog of xac <dig>  blastn comparison of the lps locus of bxo <dig> to those of xac strain  <dig> and xoc strain bls <dig> was done using artemis comparison tool, and the region comprising orf <dig> to orf <dig> of bxo <dig> was found to exhibit more identity to xoc strain bls <dig>  than to xac strain  <dig> .

there is however, very little similarity in the block of genes that begin from the metb side, except for wzm  and wzt . the wzm orf encodes a  <dig> aa size protein that shows homology to a putative transporter permease  of nitrosospira multiformis atcc  <dig> . the wzt orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein that shows homology to a putative atp binding protein  of burkholderia xenovorans lb <dig> . the wxocf orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein that shows homology to a putative acetyltransferase  of pseudomonas fluorescens pf- <dig> . the wxocd orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein that is homologous to a glycosyltransferase  of pelodictyon phaeoclathratiforme bu- <dig> . the wxoca orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein that shows homology to a lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein-like protein  of an uncultured bacterium belonging to candidate division tm <dig> genomosp. gtl <dig> . the wxocb orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein that is homologous to a lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein-like protein  of the uncultured bacterium candidate division tm <dig> genomosp. gtl <dig> . orf  <dig> encodes a  <dig> aa protein that shows homology to a conserved hypothetical protein  of bacillus weihenstephane kbab <dig> . overall, xoc strain bls  <dig> has a hybrid lps gene cluster, with one part similar to bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig>  and the other half being very different.

comparison of the lps gene clusters of xoo strain bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig> to stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain r551-3
stenotrophomonas maltophilia belongs to the xanthomonadaceae but is not phytopathogenic. whole genome shotgun sequence of a stenotrophomonas maltophilia  strain r551- <dig> is available through ncbi . interestingly, a  <dig>  kb gene cluster that encodes  <dig> orfs, several of which have predicted functions involved in lps biosynthesis, is located between metb and etfa . the organization of these  <dig> orfs is shown in fig  <dig> and the list of orfs and their predicted functions is given in additional file  <dig>  the first two orfs from the metb side encode a putative abc transporter permease  and putative atp binding protein  genes that are present in many lps gene clusters. the wzm and wzt genes of sma r551- <dig> strain exhibit 44% and 34% nucleotide sequence identity to their bxo <dig> orthologs and 46% and 37% identity to their counterparts in xac strain  <dig>  the next five genes  in the lps gene cluster of sma strain r551- <dig> are unrelated to genes in the lps loci of xoo strain bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig>  strikingly, the last three orfs in the lps gene cluster of sma strain r551- <dig> are orthologous to predicted short chain dehydrogenase, oxidoreductase and integral membrane protein encoding genes that are located near the etfa end of the lps gene clusters of bxo <dig>  xac strain  <dig> and xoc strain bls <dig>  a nucleotide level comparison of these genes in the lps gene cluster of sma strain r55c- <dig> to those of their orthologs in xoo strain bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig> strain is shown in fig  <dig> 

comparison of the lps gene clusters of three xcc strains and xanthomonas campestris pv. armoraciae strain 756c
nucleotide level comparison of lps gene clusters of three xcc strains, atcc <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> , and b <dig>  <cit> , is shown in fig.  <dig>  the sizes of the lps loci of these strains are  <dig>  kb  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb, respectively. one reason for the differences in size is the presence of is elements in atcc <dig>  and in  <dig> . the g+c content of each locus is around 58%. the lps gene clusters of atcc <dig> and  <dig> exhibit almost 100% nucleotide identity. surprisingly, the lps locus of b <dig> exhibits only 69% nucleotide identity to the lps locus of these two strains. only regions of  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb at the two extremities of the lps locus of b <dig> exhibit high nucleotide identity  with the lps gene clusters of atcc <dig> and  <dig> 

tblastx comparisons of the lps loci of these three xcc strains identified one region that is specific to strain b <dig>  this region is annotated to contain a wxco gene encoding a putative integral membrane protein of  <dig> amino acid length  <cit> . in the other two xcc strains, this region is annotated to contain an unknown gene  encoding a hypothetical protein of  <dig> amino acids. interestingly, a homolog of wxco is present in strain 85- <dig> of x. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria {xav, a pathogen of tomato and pepper plants; formerly x. campestris pv vesicatoria  <cit> }, where it is annotated as a putative carbohydrate translocase   <cit>  and in yersinia bercovieri atcc <dig>  where it is annotated as a hypothetical protein [zp_ <dig> ; identity 36% and similarity 54%). homologs of xcc <dig> and xc_ <dig> were not identifiable through blastx in any other bacteria. the xcc0613/xc_ <dig> orf has a g+c content of  <dig> %, which is substantially lower than average for other xanthomonad genes, and is suggestive of its acquisition by hgt. the fact that this orf is not present in the lps clusters of xcc strain b <dig> and xav strain 85- <dig>  and that a different orf  is present at the corresponding position in these bacteria, is an additional indication that this orf might have been acquired by hgt.

x. campestris pv. armoraciae  is the causal agent of bacterial leaf spot of cruciferous plants and is closely related to xcc. as indicated in table  <dig>  the genome sequence of xca strain 756c is available through the comprehensive microbial resource  <cit> . the results of nucleotide level comparison of the lps gene clusters of xcc strains atcc <dig>   <dig>  and b <dig> with xca strain 756c is shown in fig.  <dig>  the lps gene cluster of b <dig> exhibits almost 100% nucleotide sequence identity to the lps gene cluster of xca strain 756c. the size of the lps gene cluster is  <dig>  kb in both strains.

a comparison of the lps locus of xca strain 756c with that of xcc strain atcc <dig> and xav strain 85- <dig> is provided in fig  <dig>  except for wxoo, all of the other  <dig> orfs of the lps gene cluster of xca strain 756c have orthologs in the lps locus of xcc strain atcc <dig>  four of these orthologs, wxca, wxcl, wxck and wxch, have a very high level of nucleotide sequence identity . the remaining  <dig> orthologs exhibit a significantly lower level of sequence identity . the lps gene cluster of xav strain 85- <dig> contains orthologs of ten of the genes in the lps gene cluster of xca strain 756c with varying degrees of nucleotide sequence identity. the lps gene cluster of xav strain 85- <dig> does not contain orthologs of wxca, wxcc, wxcd, wxce and wxch. however, the xav strain 85- <dig> lps locus has three unique orfs which are wxda <dig>  wxda <dig> and an orf that encodes a hypothetical protein .

discussion
extensive interstrain differences are observed among lps biosynthetic gene clusters of animal pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . these variations reflect the highly immunogenic nature of lps and a necessity for the pathogen to vary lps to evade detection by the host. studies relating to lps in phytopathogenic bacteria mostly describe either effects on virulence of mutations in lps biosynthetic gene clusters or the role of lps in inducing defense responses. the present study extends our previous work demonstrating interstrain variations at lps loci in plant pathogenic bacteria and provides important insights into the extent of variation and the evolution of lps gene clusters in different xanthomonads. we report that the bxo <dig> and bxo <dig> strains of xoo have lps gene clusters that are completely different in sequence, number and organization of genes. the  <dig>  kb lps gene cluster of bxo <dig>  which is also present in xoo strains kacc <dig> and maff <dig>  does not show significant similarity to the lps gene clusters of any of the other sequenced xanthomonads, while the bxo <dig> lps gene cluster is highly similar to the lps locus of xac strain  <dig>  a citrus pathogen. the bxo <dig> strain belongs to pathotype 1b  <cit>  of xoo in india while the bxo <dig> strain represents a different pathotype, not yet given a designation but similar to pathotype  <dig>  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether the differences in pathological properties between the bxo <dig> and bxo <dig> strains depend on the differences in their lps gene clusters.

interestingly, in strain bls <dig> of the related xanthomonad, xoc, only one half of the lps gene cluster is similar to that of the lps loci of bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig>  this suggests the possibility that the ancestor of both x. oryzae pathovars had an xac strain  <dig> type of lps gene cluster, that one hgt event in the ancestor of the xoc lineage replaced part of a xac strain  <dig> type of gene cluster with novel sequences, and that one more hgt event occurred to introduce a totally new lps gene cluster into the ancestor of most xoo strains. in previous work, we showed that the bxo <dig> type of lps cluster is present in xoo strains from india, nepal, china, malaysia, indonesia, the philippines and korea  <cit> . this suggests that the hgt event which led to the introduction of the bxo <dig> type of lps cluster into the xoo genome must have occurred before the dispersal of the ancestor of these strains to the many widely separated locations in which they are found.

genes at the lps loci are important contributors to pathogenesis. mutations at the lps loci in xoo and xcc result in severe virulence deficiency  <cit> . a mutation in the putative wzt gene of bxo <dig> results in a lps defect and severe virulence deficiency . a mutation in the wxocb gene in the lps locus of xoc strain bls <dig> also reduces virulence . these results when taken together indicate that, in spite of largescale variations, the lps locus likely plays a central role in pathogenesis in most xanthomonads that infect plants. one striking finding of the blast searches was that the first five orfs  of the bxo <dig> and xac strain  <dig> lps loci have homologs in gst strain nrs 2004/3a. gst is a gram-positive thermophile and these genes are predicted to be involved in glycosylation of a surface  layer protein  <cit> . it is possible that a metagenome repertoire is contributing, to disparate bacteria, genes that participate in lps biosynthesis and/or s-layer glycosylation.

the sequences of lps gene clusters from three xcc strains also gave evidence of hgt. the lps gene cluster of xcc strain b <dig> is significantly different from the lps cluster present in two other strains of xcc. surprisingly, the nucleotide sequence of the xcc b <dig> lps locus is almost 100% identical to the lps gene cluster of xca strain 756c. one possibility is that the lps gene cluster of xcc strain b <dig> was acquired by a hgt event from an xca strain. since xcc and xca infect the same hosts, there is opportunity for such a genetic exchange to occur. the high level of nucleotide sequence similarity  between the lps gene clusters of xcc strain b <dig> and xca strain 756c suggests that, if such a genetic exchange did occur, it must have happened fairly recently. alternatively, xca may have diverged recently from an xcc strain with a b <dig> type lps locus. the frequency with which the two divergent lps gene clusters are present in different xcc and xca strains  remains to be determined and would help to clarify the likely scenario.

in the genomes of all sequenced xanthomonads, there is an lps locus between the metb and etfa genes. however, what is present at this locus is variable. a schematic diagram of the different xanthomonad lps gene clusters compared in this study is shown in fig.  <dig>  it appears that multiple horizontal gene transfer events in the xanthomonas lineage have contributed to this diversity. the genome of the pepper and tomato pathogen xav strain 85- <dig> is more related to that of xac strain  <dig> than either is to xcc  <cit> . even though both the xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars are closely related, xac strain  <dig> and xav strain 85- <dig> have entirely different lps gene clusters, the lps locus of xav strain 85- <dig> being similar, in overall gene organization and content, to that of xcc strain b <dig> and xca 756c. this suggests that at least one hgt has occurred in the ancestor of xac and xav. a  <dig>  kb orf  in xcc strains atcc <dig> and  <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein that has no orthologs in the sequenced xanthomonads. we propose that a hgt event might have introduced this unique orf into the genome of the ancestor of xcc strains atcc <dig> and  <dig>  overall, the results of this study indicate that multiple hgt events have occurred at this locus in the xanthomonads and that the variation introduced by hgt can involve either the entire lps locus or part of the locus. a hypothetical evolutionary tree illustrating a pattern of hgt events that could explain the relationships observed among the lps gene clusters of the xanthomonas strains examined here is presented in figure  <dig> 

our finding of large scale interstrain variation mediated by hgt at an lps locus, in two important xanthomonad pathogens infecting diverse hosts, suggests that plant pathogenic bacteria are under selection to vary their lps gene clusters i.e., that variations have an important adaptive value. lps is known to strongly modulate plant immune responses  <cit> . the study of desaki et al  <cit>  indicates that the intensity of defense responses of rice cells towards lps from pathogens and non-pathogens is different and suggests that recognition of lps is important. gross et al  <cit>  suggest that xcc lps is taken up into tobacco cells through receptor mediated endocytosis. variation in lps biosynthetic gene clusters may block recognition/uptake and help in evading the innate immune responses of the host. an alternative or additional possibility is that variability is driven by selection for resistance to bacteriophages that infect xanthomonads.

stenotrophomonas maltophilia belongs to the xanthomonadaceae family. it is found in a wide range of environmental habitats, including agricultural settings, and is also an important cause of nosocomial infections. the genome sequence of stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain r551- <dig>  which is an endophyte of poplar  <cit> , is available at ncbi. interestingly, as in the xanthomonas strains, in stenotrophomonas maltophilia an lps gene cluster is present between metb and etfa. in addition, it is pertinent to note that some of the genes in this locus are also related to genes in the lps clusters of the xoo bxo <dig> and xac  <dig> strains.

a distinct locus also required for lps biosynthesis is present near the etfa/metb locus in xcc strain b <dig> and consists of rmla, rmlb, rmlc, rmld , xana, xanb  and lpsi, lpsj   <cit> . all of these genes are highly conserved in each of the other sequenced xanthomonads  and in stenotrophomonas maltophilia  . as indicated above, these genes are involved in the synthesis of lps precursors. the lack of variation in these genes suggests that these lps precursors are conserved constituents of lps in all xanthomonads.

pathogenic members of the genus xanthomonas cause diseases on at least  <dig> plant species. currently, we have knowledge of the lps gene clusters representing only a handful of xanthomonas species and pathovars. analysis of the lps biosynthetic loci of a larger set of strains would shed further light on the extent of variation in lps gene clusters in the xanthomonads and on the evolution that has been occurring at this locus, as well as the selective forces driving that evolution. as indicated in this study, long range pcr can be used effectively to isolate and sequence the lps locus in diverse xanthomonads using primers that are targeted to the conserved metb and etfa genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the lps locus in the bxo <dig> strain of the rice pathogen xoo is orthologous to the lps locus of xac, a xanthomonad that infects citrus. the lps locus in another x. oryzae pathovar that infects rice, xoc, is chimeric, with one half of this locus being orthologous to the lps locus in bxo <dig> and xac. a comparison of these lps loci indicates that the ancestor of all x. oryzae pathovars is likely to have had an lps locus that is related to the corresponding locus in xac with variations in the x. oryzae lineage being introduced by several largescale hgt events. this study also presents interstrain variation at the lps locus that provides evidence of hgt in xcc, a xanthomonad pathogen that infects crucifer plants, indicating that interstrain variation in lps biosynthetic genes is not a phenomenon restricted to x. oryzae pathovars. overall, the pronounced variation in lps biosynthetic gene cluster content across the several xanthomonas strains described here suggests diversifying selection consistent with lps playing a pivotal role in the interactions of members of this important group of plant pathogens with their hosts. further, the analysis reveals that hgt has played a major part in generating this variation.
