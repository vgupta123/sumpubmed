BACKGROUND
single-nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most frequent type of variation found in dna  <cit>  and are valuable markers for high-throughput genetic mapping, genetic variation studies and association mapping in crop plants. several methods have been described for snp discovery  <cit> : snp mining from expressed sequence tag  databases  <cit> ; based on array hybridization  <cit>  or amplicon resequencing  <cit> ; from the complete sequence of a genome  <cit>  and more recently, using high-throughput sequencing technologies  <cit> . the discovery of snp markers based on transcribed regions has become a common application in plants because of the large number of ests available in databases, and est-snps have been successfully mined from est databases in non-model species such as atlantic salmon  <cit> , catfish  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and white spruce  <cit> .

melon  is an important crop worldwide. it belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, which also includes cucumber, watermelon, pumpkin and squash. the melon genome has an estimated size of  <dig> mb  <cit>  and is a diploid with a basic chromosome number of x =  <dig>  in recent years research has been carried out to increase the genetic and genomic resources for this species, such as the sequencing of ests  <cit> , the construction of a bac library  <cit> , the development of an oligo-based microarray  <cit>  and the development of a collection of near isogenic lines   <cit> . genetic maps have also been reported for melon, but they have been constructed with different types of molecular markers and genetic backgrounds  <cit> , making it difficult to transfer markers from one map to another. the aim of the international cucurbit genomics initiative   <cit> , currently in progress, is to obtain a consensus genetic map by merging genetic maps available using a common set of ssrs as anchor markers.

a double haploid line  population from the cross between the korean accession pi  <dig>  and the inodorus type 'piel de sapo' t <dig>  was the basis for the construction of a genetic map with  <dig> co-dominant, transferable rflp and ssr markers  <cit> . new est-derived ssr markers, added to this map using a bin-mapping strategy with only  <dig> mapping individuals, gave a new map with  <dig> markers distributed in  <dig> bins and a density of  <dig>  cm/marker  <cit> . there is a need for saturating the sc × ps genetic map with more markers that are amenable for large-scale genotyping, as are snps. in a preliminary experiment with melon, amplicon resequencing of  <dig> ests in sc and ps was used for snp discovery, obtaining a frequency of one snp every  <dig> bp and one indel every  <dig>  bp  <cit> . the availability of more than  <dig>  melon ests from normalized cdna libraries from different melon genotypes and tissues  <cit>  is a valuable resource for the identification of snps to be added to the current genetic map.

genetic markers can also be used for variability analysis studies. in melon, there have been several attempts to elucidate intraspecific relationships among melon germplasm, using isozyme  <cit> , rflp  <cit> , rapd  <cit> , aflp  <cit>  and ssr  <cit>  markers, with ssrs the preferred marker for fingerprinting and genetic variability analysis in melon  <cit> . due to the absence of a known set of snps in the species, this marker has not been compared with other types for variability analysis. it would be of special interest to have a set of these markers for a high-throughput system to identify the germplasm used in breeding programs, mainly from inodorus and the cantalupensis melon types.

the objectives of this work were to increase the marker resolution in the melon genetic map, discovering est-snps in a melon est database, and to study the performance of a subset of est-snps for variability analysis in a collection of melon accessions.

RESULTS
snp discovery
two strategies were used to discover snps in melon. the first was based on producing amplicons from randomly selected melon ests and resequencing the parental lines of the melon genetic map pi  <dig>  × 'piel de sapo' t <dig> . primers were designed from  <dig> melon ests . after discarding primers that did not amplify a pcr product, amplicons that did not produce high quality sequences and monomorphic amplicons,  <dig> ests  showed at least one polymorphism between sc and ps.

ests were selected at random or chosen because they contained psnps or pschs in the melogen database. columns show the number of amplicons that failed to amplify or gave bad quality sequences, and monomorphic and polymorphic amplicons between sc and ps. the percentages of polymorphic amplicons and in silico snps that were validated are shown in the last two columns.  polymorphic amplicons rate was calculated without considering failed amplicons.

the second strategy was the validation of in silico snps from the icugi database  <cit> . three hundred and sixty-six in silico snps found in the database were selected, belonging to two types of snps: psnp and psch . primers were designed from  <dig> ests containing psnp and  <dig> containing pschs. putative in silico snps were validated in  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the amplicons for psnps and pschs, respectively. in some instances additional snps were detected in the sequenced regions, giving a slightly higher percentage of polymorphic amplicons . from the ests reported by gonzalez-ibeas et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> % were obtained from two accessions of the 'piel de sapo' cultivar type , and the remainder from two genotypes, the c- <dig> cantaloupe accession  and the pat <dig> agrestis accession . the psnps and pschs were deduced from this set of est sequences, with a high proportion found between pat <dig> and 'piel de sapo', and snps experimentally validated after resequencing amplicons from ps and sc. sc belongs to the agrestis melon type as the accession pat <dig> but has a different origin, so, as expected not all the snps were conserved between sc and ps, giving a psnp validation of  <dig> %. on the other hand, only  <dig> % of the pschs were validated, indicating that many may represent sequencing errors or mutations introduced during the cdna synthesis procedure. the snps in a subset of amplicons containing in silico snps between 'piel de sapo' and pat <dig> were validated using different genotyping methods  rather than resequencing in ps and sc.

a total of  <dig> amplicons  were resequenced in ps and sc and produced  <dig>  kb of melon dna, with  <dig> snps and  <dig> short indels, at an average of one snp every  <dig> bp and one indel every  <dig>  kb, . this is in agreement with the values obtained in a previous small-scale experiment using the same two melon accessions, which gave one snp every  <dig> bp and one indel every  <dig>  kb  <cit> . sc and ps belong to the agrestis  and inodorus  melon groups, respectively, which are two of the more distant groups in the species  <cit> . this may explain the relatively high frequency of snps between the cultivars.

data from a previous report using the same two melon parental lines is shown as a comparison.

snp detection
various detection methods were used for genotyping the snps in each est. a restriction site around the snp position, different in the parental sequences, was used to develop a caps marker for  <dig> est-snps. when more than one snp was discovered in one amplicon, we selected the most suitable snp for detection using caps. when no restriction enzyme was available to produce a caps marker, we used the snapshot snp detection system. seventy-seven est-snps were genotyped with snapshot. for  <dig> ests, ps and sc gave a different amplicon size, so they could be genotyped as scar markers. four est-snps were genotyped using dna sequencing and two were converted into dcaps. the snp detection method used for each mapped est-snp is shown in additional file  <dig> 

snp variability
forty-five snps  were randomly chosen to study their variability in a set of melon accessions of worldwide cultivar and botanical types . the inodorus cultivars were overrepresented in order to assess whether snps between distant melon accessions  were also variable among more closely related genotypes.

all snps were polymorphic and the mean major allele frequency was  <dig>  . only one snp  had a rare allele , whereas the frequencies of the two alleles were similar in  <dig> snps . average gene diversity  was  <dig>  . forty-three snps yielded he >  <dig> , demonstrating that most of the chosen snps were highly informative, as found for snps in rye  <cit>  but contrasting with crops such as soybean  <cit>  and wheat  <cit>  where snps yielding rare alleles are more frequent.

ho, observed heterozygosity; he expected heterozygosity. * major allele frequency was only calculated for polymorphic snps.

the mean gene diversity index for snps was considerably lower than the values reported for ssrs in melon . to ensure the difference was not due to sampling, gene diversity indexes were estimated using a subset of genotypes that had been included in a previous study with ssrs  <cit>  . the differences in gene diversity were confirmed, demonstrating that they were intrinsic to the different marker type. snps are biallelic, implying that the he value can not exceed  <dig> , whereas ssrs are multiallelic and so it can be higher. haplotypes may yield higher gene diversity values than individual snps and provide more efficient application of snp markers  <cit> .

all inodorus genotypes could be distinguished with the set of snps, although polymorphism was notably reduced . fourteen snps were monomorphic and  <dig> were informative . as most of the snps were discovered between the agrestis and inodorus cultivar and not within inodorus, we expected the snp polymorphism within inodorus to be lower. nevertheless, these results demonstrate that snps discovered using a germplasm sample can be successfully transferred to different germplasm samples in melon.

the genetic relationships among accessions based on snp polymorphism were investigated by cluster analysis. the nj dendrogram  fits very well with previous classifications using different markers  <cit> . comparing the common genotype set in  <cit> , the average pair-wise distances based on snps and ssr were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the correlation between the two distance matrices was  <dig>   according to mantel's test, confirming that the current snp set is as effective as ssrs in establishing genetic relationships among melon accessions, as shown in species such as rye  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> .

the population structure was estimated using the structure software  <cit> . the a posteriori probability of the data increased rapidly from k =  <dig> to  <dig> and begun to reach a plateau for k =  <dig>  inferring that our collection can be divided in five populations. genetic variability among melon germplasm seems to be highly structured. the subdivision of the accessions in  <dig> populations agrees with the botanical classification and the cluster analysis : group  <dig> included all the inodorus cultivars from spain; group  <dig>  a diverse group of traditional inodorus landraces and similar ones from the near-east region such as elongated  and asiatic ananas and chandalak types; group  <dig>  modern cantalupensis cultivars; group  <dig>  mainly traditional varieties and wild melons from india and africa and group  <dig> included conomon accessions from the far east. the population structure should be taken into account when establishing a collection of genotypes for association mapping studies in melon and models including population structure should be used  <cit> . alternatively, melon collections without structure, as we found with the inodorus melon accessions included in our studies, could be used.

these results demonstrate that snps discovered using a small germplasm sample can be transferred to different cultivar groups, being useful for depicting genetic relationships as well as for cultivar identification.

snp mapping using a bin-mapping strategy
two hundred and seventy-eight snp-containing ests  plus twelve additional snp-containing ests previously discovered between the two parental lines  <cit>  were used for mapping in the sc × ps genetic map using  <dig> dhls of the melon bin-mapping population  <cit> . in total,  <dig> est-derived snps were mapped, yielding  <dig> new markers . f <dig> produced two scar markers  that mapped to groups i and v, respectively. our previous melon bin-map contained  <dig> markers distributed in  <dig> bins, with a density of  <dig>  cm/marker and  <dig>  markers per bin  <cit> . with the addition of  <dig> candidate genes previously reported for resistance to virus and fruit ripening  <cit>  and the snps now described, the new bin-map contains  <dig> markers, distributed in  <dig> bins, with an increased density of  <dig>  cm/marker and  <dig>  markers per bin. the snp-based markers defined  <dig> new bins with an average bin length of  <dig>  cm. some of the new bins were located in regions with poor marker density in the previous sc × ps melon map  <cit> , such as hs_30-b <dig> in group xi, ai_12-b <dig> in group vii, a_38-f <dig> in group vi or p <dig>  in group iii.

essentially the new version of the melon bin-map is a gene-based map, with  <dig> markers  obtained from gene sequences. additionally,  <dig> rflps derived from ests were previously mapped in an f <dig> population from the cross sc × ps  <cit> , and their approximate position can also be plotted in the corresponding bin-map. as a large proportion of the markers are codominant and based on gene sequences, this makes this map a very useful tool for melon breeding and comparative analysis in cucurbit species.

with the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, snp discovery has become more feasible in non-model crop species, allowing the discovery of thousands of snps in a single experiment  <cit> . in eucalyptus grandis more than  <dig>  snps were discovered using  <dig> sequencing technology, with a validation rate of 83%  <cit> . in melon, a preliminary analysis of  <dig>  reads obtained after  <dig> sequencing of leaf cdnas from sc and ps produced more than  <dig>  snps . this indicates that the use of next generation sequencing technologies is the next step towards saturation of the melon genetic map.

CONCLUSIONS
the set of  <dig> snp markers discovered and mapped have increased the marker resolution of the melon genetic map by defining new bins. the genetic map contains more than  <dig> gene-based codominant markers , which can be used as anchor points with other genetic maps in this species. this genetic map is also a useful resource for comparative mapping in the cucurbitaceae, for the construction of the melon physical map and for sequencing the melon genome. additionally, the set of snps has proven to be as useful as microsatellites for studying genetic relationships in melon and for varietal identification.
