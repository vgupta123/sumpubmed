BACKGROUND
nitric oxide is a major messenger molecule with a broad array of physiological functions, which include the ability to promote cell survival during conditions of serum starvation and oxidative stress  <cit> . at the same time, no is a key effector of the cell-mediated immune response, acting as a cytotoxic agent against invading pathogens  <cit> , as well as having the potential to cause dna damage and cell death in mammalian cells  <cit> . such diverse and sometimes opposing roles can be better understood by considering the complex chemistry of no. no can react directly with iron in heme and iron-sulfur proteins or, it can react with superoxide to form highly oxidizing peroxynitrite. no can also react with oxygen to generate higher nitrogen oxides  in which no is oxidized to the nitrosonium ion , the no redox form responsible for its reactions with thiols  <cit> .

in this way no elicits both nitrosative and oxidative stress, conditions that result in heme oxygenase- <dig>  up-regulation  <cit> . ho- <dig> catalyzes heme degradation, and is induced by a variety of stress inducers, such as cadmium chloride , sodium arsenite  and hydrogen peroxide , an effect that is consistent with the role of ho- <dig> as a protective enzyme  <cit> . the relevance of ho- <dig> induction in response to no has become apparent from studies with ho- <dig> knockout mice and tissues, which show increased sensitivity to endotoxin   <cit> . furthermore, motor neurons respond to sub-lethal fluxes of no by activating defense mechanisms that allow them to survive a subsequent exposure to higher doses of no. under these conditions, ho- <dig> is induced and its activity is required for this adaptive resistance to no  <cit> .

ho- <dig> mrna levels are also increased in response to no in human imr <dig> lung fibroblasts, and transcriptional induction is only partially responsible. instead, the ho- <dig> mrna half-life is substantially increased from ~ <dig> h in controls to > <dig> h in no-treated cells  <cit> . thus, no can regulate the ho- <dig> mrna decay process and in this way contributes to the up-regulation of ho- <dig> expression.

the decay of mrna is a tightly controlled process dependent on a core machinery for poly tail shortening and 5'-decapping, as well as a 5'→3' nuclease, and the exosome responsible for 3'→5'decay  <cit> . in addition to these factors, transcript-specific sequence elements and trans-factors that bind them regulate the decay process  <cit> . in general, poly tail shortening  is the rate-limiting step in this process, since it is required for both 5'→3' and 3'→5' decay  <cit> , and for several transcripts decapping does not normally occur until the poly tail is sufficiently shortened  <cit> .

consistent with poly tail shortening as a rate-limiting step in mrna decay, this step is targeted for regulation in at least two other pathways: nonsense-mediated decay  and decay of mrna containing au-rich sequence elements . during deadenylation-dependent nonsense-mediated decay, the presence of a premature termination codon results in an increased rate of poly tail shortening and subsequent decay of the aberrant transcripts  <cit> . shortening of the poly tail is also relevant for the decay of transcripts such as granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor, c-fos and c-myc, whose half-life is regulated by ares  <cit> . these sequence elements can act in cis to increase the rate of poly tail shortening and the overall decay of a stable β-globin transcript  <cit> . ares mediate responses to cellular stresses and pro-inflammatory stimuli, as evidenced by the regulation of are-dependent deadenylation by p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  <cit> . are-binding proteins such as auf <dig> and hur have been shown to regulate mrna half-life in response to genotoxic and oxidative stress  <cit> , and are-binding proteins that promote or inhibit poly tail shortening, such as tristetraprolin or hud, control the half-life of mrna and are regulated by growth factors, endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other extracellular stimuli  <cit> . thus mrna poly tail shortening can be a key step in an mrna decay pathway that is tightly regulated in response to extracellular stimuli.

in this study, we have begun to dissect the mechanistic pathway of ho- <dig> mrna turnover and the effects of no. we examined the generality of ho- <dig> post-transcriptional regulation in response to other sources of cellular stress. we have also identified a novel regulatory mechanism in which the initial rate of ho- <dig> mrna poly tail shortening in response to no remains largely unaffected, with stabilization achieved by preventing the final deadenylation steps or decapping. these results provide insights into the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation and the role of deadenylation during cellular stress responses.

RESULTS
no-mediated stabilization of ho- <dig> mrna in nih3t <dig> cells
previous studies in human imr <dig> fibroblasts showed that ho- <dig> mrna is stabilized in response to no  <cit> . however, because these primary cells senesce in culture and posed experimental limitations, as an alternative we tested mouse nih3t <dig> fibroblasts for no-induced stabilization of the ho- <dig> message. to provide controlled no exposure in culture, we used the diazeniumdiolate no donors sper/no and deta/no, which release two molecules of no per donor molecule at a steady and reproducible rate  <cit> . we used sper/no for a 1-h no exposure , or deta/no  for longer exposures to no.

nih3t <dig> cells were treated with  <dig>  mm sper/no for  <dig> h, after which transcription was blocked by adding  <dig> μg/ml of ad. in untreated controls, ho- <dig> mrna decayed with a  <dig>  h half-life. upon treatment with sper/no, ho- <dig> mrna was stabilized with a half-life of  <dig> h . to examine the specificity of this post-transcriptional regulation by no, we measured in the same samples the half-life of the unstable, stress-inducible transcript encoding cl <dig> phosphatase  <cit> . treatment with sper/no did not stabilize cl <dig> mrna , suggesting that the effect on ho- <dig> mrna is not due to a general inhibition of no on cellular mrna turnover. moreover, recent microarray results from this laboratory indicate that the stability of the vast majority of mrnas in nih3t <dig> or imr <dig> cells is unaffected by no .

ho- <dig> mrna induction experiments were also carried out using a prolonged exposure to no, in which nih3t <dig> cells were monitored in parallel for cell viability by trypan blue exclusion. increasing doses of deta/no resulted in increased ho- <dig> mrna stability, with the half-life ranging from  <dig>  h in controls, to  <dig>  h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after deta/no treatments of  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm and  <dig> mm, respectively . there was also a negative correlation between the deta/no level and cell proliferation during  <dig> h after the treatment . although no did not seem to affect the viable cell number immediately after the treatment and for up to  <dig> h, the interval during which mrna stability was assessed, by  <dig> h post-exposure an effect on cell proliferation was apparent. the untreated cell population doubled in  <dig> h, as was true for the cells exposed to  <dig>  mm deta/no. however, at higher deta/no levels, cell proliferation was prevented . note that there was no loss in cell viability immediately after no treatment with up to  <dig> mm deta/no, and only a small decrease in viability in cells treated with  <dig> mm deta/no , conditions under which the ho- <dig> mrna was strongly stabilized . these effects of deta/no on ho- <dig> mrna stabilization and cell proliferation, were similarly produced by treatment with s-nitroso-l-glutathione . thus nih3t <dig> cells are a suitable model to further characterize the mechanism of ho- <dig> mrna stabilization by no.

effect of cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> and h2o <dig> on ho- <dig> mrna induction and stabilization
to determine whether the post-transcriptional regulation of ho- <dig> mrna was specific to no or part of a general stress response, and to inform the chemistry of this signaling pathway, we tested several compounds chemically unrelated to no for their effect on ho- <dig> mrna stability. the molecular targets of these compounds overlap partially with those of no. in particular, the reactions of no with thiols to form nitrosothiols  <cit> , and the eventual depletion of intracellular glutathione  <cit> , prompted us to investigate the oxidant h2o <dig>  and the thiol-reactive compounds cdcl <dig> and naaso <dig>  which can alter the redox equilibrium  <cit> .

the contribution of post-transcriptional events in regulating expression of the ho- <dig> mrna was determined for different concentrations of cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> and h2o <dig> in a 6-h exposure. all three agents, at concentrations that induced ho- <dig> mrna to steady-state levels comparable to those produced by no , had an effect on ho- <dig> mrna stability, but in all cases less than the effect observed for no treatment . under our conditions, cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> and h2o2increased the half-life of ho- <dig> mrna to 5– <dig> h, while a treatment with  <dig> mm deta/no resulted in an ho- <dig> mrna half-life of  <dig> h . thus, other sources of cellular stress can affect ho- <dig> mrna stability. at the concentrations used, cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> and h2o <dig> did not prevent cell proliferation throughout a 24-h time course after the treatments, in contrast to the decreased cell proliferation and viability observed in response to no. .

effect of methyl methane sulfonate on ho- <dig> mrna stability
to address the possibility that inhibition of cell proliferation stabilizes ho- <dig> mrna, we treated nih3t <dig> cells with methyl methane sulfonate , a compound that alkylates dna and other cellular targets in a non-oxidative fashion. treatment with mms affected both cell viability and ho- <dig> mrna stability . at  <dig>  mm mms, ho- <dig> mrna was partly stabilized, and treatment with  <dig> mm mms resulted in an ho- <dig> mrna half-life of > <dig> h, comparable to that attained with no-treatment. however, the stabilizing mms treatments were accompanied by strong inhibition of cell proliferation and reduced viability  <dig> h after the exposure, and in the  <dig> mm treatment, decreased gapdh mrna levels .

ho- <dig> mrna stabilization is not due to the use of an alternative transcriptional start site
for most mrnas, decay begins with shortening of the 3' poly tail followed by 5' decapping and then rapid digestion of the body of the message. in some cases, stability is regulated through the use of alternative polyadenylation sites  <cit> , or through alternative transcriptional start sites to give different 5' untranslated regions   <cit> . we have closely examined the short 93-nt 3'utr of ho- <dig> for known polyadenylation motifs  <cit> , and have only found a single polyadenylation motif, which suggests that ho- <dig> mrna is not regulated through an alternative polyadenylation site in this region. additional potential polyadenylation motifs also seem to be absent from the murine ho- <dig> gene. we therefore performed primer extension assays to determine the transcriptional start site of ho- <dig> mrna in control and no-treated cells . the ho- <dig> transcripts from both the control nih3t <dig> and the no-treated cells yielded main products of indistinguishable mobility, which corresponded to the reported mouse ho- <dig> transcriptional start site  <cit> . primer extension products from cells treated with cdcl <dig> and mms were also similar to products from untreated cells, and again corresponded to the reported transcriptional start site . thus, ho- <dig> mrna induction by these agents was not associated with the use of an alternative transcriptional start site.

no does not prevent deadenylation but affects the deadenylation rate
shortening of the 3' poly tail  is often rate-limiting in mrna decay, and we therefore developed a deadenylation assay specific for endogenous ho- <dig> mrna. dna oligonucleotides were used to target rnase h cleavage prior to separation of the fragments by gel electrophoresis and detection by northern blotting  <cit> . the length of the poly tail in ho- <dig> mrna was estimated by comparison against size markers, including a fully deadenylated ho- <dig> fragment generated in vitro.

nih3t <dig> cells were treated with  <dig>  mm sper/no for  <dig> h, followed by the addition of ad and sampling at various times thereafter. part of each sample was used without further modification to assess the half-life of ho- <dig> mrna , and the rest of the sample was used in a deadenylation assay. upon oligo-directed cleavage, as seen in fig. 4a, two distinct ho- <dig> mrna populations were detected in the samples from no-treated cells: a steady-state population that had undergone different extents of poly tail shortening, and newly transcribed ho- <dig> mrna that had the longest poly tails of ~250-nt . the latter mrna population resembles the product expected from a transcriptional pulse  <cit> , consistent with ho- <dig> induction by no including both transcriptional  and post-transcriptional components  <cit> . in this regard, it is important to note that because our experiments have the advantage of analyzing the endogenous ho- <dig> mrna rather than an inducible transcript, the starting point of our experiments represents the steady state population of mrnas that have undergone different extents of decay. thus, evaluating the average intensities in our deadenylation assays would neglect to consider the actual rate of shortening of the longer poly tails. therefore, we marked the position below which 95–98% of the signal remained, and considered this upper 2–5% boundary to correspond to the mrnas with the longest poly tails, and the only part of the signal where we could accurately monitor poly tail shortening . this analysis showed that poly shortening of ho- <dig> mrna occurred in both the control and the no-treated samples . from these results, we estimated that, during the first  <dig> h of the time course, the initial rate of deadenylation was about  <dig> -fold slower in the no-treated samples  than in the controls .

fully deadenylated ho- <dig> mrna was not detected in either the control or the no-treated case. the smallest detectable fragments corresponded to a poly tail of 30– <dig> residues, which suggests that rapid decay occurs if the poly tail is shortened beyond this point. in no-treated cells, poly tail shortening up to 30– <dig> nt occurred in spite of the increased ho- <dig> mrna half-life. importantly, in contrast to controls, these shorter decay intermediates were readily detected at later time points in the no-treated samples .

mms treatment stabilizes ho- <dig> mrna by affecting the deadenylation rate
to determine whether altered deadenylation of ho- <dig> mrna is a general mechanism for its post-transcriptional regulation, we analyzed this process in mms-treated cells. we treated nih3t <dig> cells with  <dig> mm mms for  <dig> h, and followed this treatment with the addition of ad to the medium to monitor the deadenylation and decay of ho- <dig> mrna through a 12-h time course. ho- <dig> mrna expression was induced 10-fold by the mms treatment and its mrna was stabilized, with the half-life increased from  <dig> h in control samples to > <dig> h in mms-treated cells . in control and mms-treated samples both polyadenylated intermediates and partially deadenylated ho- <dig> mrna were detected immediately after the addition of ad . in control samples, ho- <dig> mrna underwent significant poly tail shortening and decay by  <dig> h , whereas treatment with mms significantly decreased the ho- <dig> mrna deadenylation rate. although during the first  <dig> h of the ad time course the rate was only  <dig> -fold slower than in controls, the effect of mms on the ho- <dig> mrna deadenylation rate was more pronounced after  <dig> h: after initial shortening to a poly size of ~200-nt, the deadenylation rate in the mms-treated samples was ~8-fold slower than in controls.

transcriptional up-regulation does not result in ho- <dig> mrna stabilization
previous experiments in human imr <dig> fibroblasts suggested that transcription inhibition may partially affect the stabilization of ho- <dig> mrna by no, decreasing the mrna half-life from  <dig> h to  <dig> h  <cit> . since transcription is tightly coupled to mrna splicing, polyadenylation, capping, export, and stability  <cit> , we decided to address the effect of transcription on ho- <dig> mrna stability.

to this end, nih3t <dig> cells were treated with cdcl <dig> under conditions that resulted in a 4-fold ho- <dig> mrna induction, similar to that of no. the cdcl <dig> treatment increased the ho- <dig> mrna half-life only modestly to ~ <dig> h . as seen in fig. 6a, ho- <dig> mrna underwent deadenylation in cdcl2-treated cells with an initial rate similar to that estimated for the untreated controls . these results suggest that post-transcriptional events contribute only marginally to the ho-1mrna up-regulation in response to cdcl <dig> 

discussion
in this study we established that nih3t <dig> mouse fibroblasts showed an increase in ho- <dig> mrna steady-state levels in response to acute exposure to no released from sper/no. this increase also correlated with a significant increase in the ho- <dig> mrna half-life, which was also observed in response to a prolonged no exposure using a slow-releasing diazeniumdiolate, deta/no or s-nitrosoglutathione. these observations are in agreement with published reports showing strong ho- <dig> mrna induction in response to no in other cell types  <cit>  and with its induction and stabilization in human imr <dig> fibroblasts  <cit>  and rat aortic smooth muscle cells in response to various sources of no  <cit> . on the other hand, we have not been able to demonstrate no-mediated stabilization of the ho- <dig> message in hela or hepg <dig> cells , which suggests that the mechanism may be limited to certain cell types.

treatment with no, at concentrations that increased ho- <dig> mrna stability, prevented cell proliferation during the  <dig> h after exposure. this observation is in agreement with the ability of no to cause cell cycle arrest  <cit> . it also parallels reports where exposure to deta/no prevented nih3t <dig> cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner, causing the induction of several growth-arrest genes: p <dig>  gadd <dig> and bax  <cit> . the induction and stabilization of ho- <dig> mrna under stress conditions that compromise cell growth is consistent with its proposed role in mediating cell survival during nitrosative and oxidative stress  <cit> .

also in agreement with this role is the induction and stabilization of ho- <dig> in response to cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> and h2o <dig>  these agents, although chemically unrelated to no, have overlapping effects on cellular physiology through the depletion of cellular glutathione, which shifts the redox equilibrium in the cell  <cit> , and can also affect the cell cycle and viability  <cit> . it is important to note that, in our study, we used exposures to cdcl <dig>  naaso <dig> and h2o <dig> similar to those previously reported to induce ho-1expression  <cit> . these concentrations were lower than those reported to affect the cell cycle and, in agreement with this, failed to block cell proliferation during  <dig> h after the exposure. it is then possible that higher concentrations of these agents are required to achieve the degree of ho- <dig> mrna stabilization seen with no. in the case of cdcl <dig>  concentrations of  <dig> μm and higher were needed to stabilize ho- <dig> mrna, but under these conditions, stability was accompanied by massive ribosomal and messenger rna degradation . the increase in the ho- <dig> mrna half-life observed in response to the non-no agents, at concentrations that resulted in a similar ho- <dig> mrna induction to that elicited by no, shows that other sources of cellular stress may regulate ho- <dig> gene expression post-transcriptionally, and that ho- <dig> mrna stabilization is not exclusive to no. overall, however, the most dramatic increase in ho- <dig> mrna half-life was consistently observed with no. therefore it is possible that, in addition to thiol-dependent reactions and oxidative stress, other no-specific reactions might mediate the post-transcriptional regulation of ho- <dig> 

because no treatments that resulted in ho- <dig> mrna stabilization were also associated with a decrease in cell proliferation, we assessed ho- <dig> mrna stability in response to mms, a cytotoxic alkylating agent. in agreement with published reports  <cit> , increasing concentrations of mms caused a decrease in the number of viable cells over time. interestingly, although chemically unrelated to no, mms exerted significant stabilization of the ho- <dig> mrna, expanding the list of known ho- <dig> inducers. in this respect it is noteworthy that mms can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways in a dna damage-independent manner, modulated by the intracellular level of glutathione  <cit> , perhaps through the ability of mms to alkylate sulfhydryl groups. therefore, as ho- <dig> mrna induction has been reported to depend on the activation of mapk pathways in some cell types  <cit> , and ho- <dig> up-regulation is modulated by the intracellular glutathione status , it is possible that mms and no regulate ho-1mrna induction and stabilization through overlapping mechanisms.

to begin to address the mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of ho- <dig> in nih3t <dig> cells, and because no evidence for alternative polyadenylation sites within the ho- <dig> gene was found, we tested whether ho- <dig> induction by no is accompanied by the use of an alternative transcriptional start site, which could in turn result in differences in the 5' untranslated region of ho- <dig> mrna and affect its stability. such an effect has been reported for unstable c-myc mrna and igfii mrna, which can be transcribed from different promoters, and whose stability is regulated through the use of alternative transcriptional start sites  <cit> . unlike these cases, the ho- <dig> transcriptional start site was not affected by any of the stabilizing treatments , consistent with other data showing that ho- <dig> mrna post-transcriptional regulation by no can occur independently of transcription  <cit> .

we also monitored the effect of no and other stress inducers on ho- <dig> mrna deadenylation, since deadenylation has been described as the rate-limiting step in mrna decay  <cit> . in stabilizing ho- <dig> mrna, no had only a small effect on the initial rate of poly tail shortening, acting instead to prevent the complete deadenylation of ho- <dig> mrna past a 30–50-nt critical poly tail length. a minimum poly tail past which degradation occurs has been previously described for globin and histone mrnas injected in xenopus laevis extracts , although such a critical length is not applicable to all mrnas, because in this system the half-life of interferon mrnas was independent of the length of their poly tail  <cit> . in this regard, it is interesting to note that, a significant amount of the ho- <dig> mrna from no-treated samples remained sufficiently polyadenylated to be retained on oligo sepharose  <dig> h after treatment  ho- <dig> mrna from no-treated cells). an alternative possibility is that no acts to block decapping, or the activity of endonucleases that might be activated when the poly tail is significantly shortened. this mechanism of stabilization of ho- <dig> mrna is in contrast to the mrna post-transcriptional regulation described for nmd and are-mediated decay, where the half-life of a transcript containing a premature termination codon or an are is regulated through changes in its deadenylation rate  <cit> . in our experiments, we estimated that the >5-fold increase in the ho- <dig> half-life that occurs in response to no is unlikely to be the result of differences in the ho- <dig> deadenylation rate, because the poly tail of ho- <dig> mrna in no-treated cells was shortened with a rate that was only  <dig> -fold slower than that of control cells.

our experiments with mms show that a different form of cellular stress can also stabilize ho- <dig>  but by a different mechanism that involves a dramatic change in the rate of shortening the poly tail from ~200-nt down. we have also demonstrated that, in spite of strong transcriptional induction of ho- <dig> in response to cdcl <dig>  this agent did not strongly affect the rate of poly tail shortening and had only a small effect on the ho- <dig> mrna half-life. as cdcl2-induced transcription did not change the start site, this experiment further supports the conclusion that stabilization occurs independently of ho- <dig> mrna transcription, and excludes the possibility that detection of oligoadenylated ho- <dig> mrna through the time course is merely a by-product of elevated ho- <dig> mrna levels prior to the addition of ad in the treated samples.

here we have characterized a mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of ho- <dig> mrna where stabilization can occur essentially independently of the initial rate of poly tail shortening, by preventing the final steps of deadenylation or a subsequent step in decay. such regulation has been reported for the stabilization of transcripts in an in vitro decay assay, where purified elav proteins did not affect deadenylation of are-containing mrna, but prevented the decay of deadenylated transcripts  <cit> . moreover, the differential regulation for the initial rate of poly tail shortening and the terminal deadenylation rate has been described for the gap- <dig> mrna by hud, a neuronal are-binding protein that can prevent poly tail shortening from transcripts containing a long poly tail   <cit> . hud appears to have no effect on the deadenylation and decay rates of gap- <dig> transcripts with short tails , perhaps because of lower binding affinity for these transcripts  <cit>  than for transcripts with longer poly tails  <cit> . in a similar way, an no-induced stabilizing factor that would preferentially bind certain mrnas with short poly tails  would affect only the terminal steps of ho- <dig> mrna deadenylation. indeed, some recent experiments demonstrate no-inducible binding to the 3' utr of ho- <dig> mrna by cellular proteins .

differential regulation of the rate of poly tail shortening and terminal deadenylation could also be achieved though the differential regulation of cellular deadenylases. to date, the activity of parn, a major cellular deadenylase, has been well characterized in hela s <dig> extracts  <cit> . in addition to parn, two yeast deadenylase activities conserved in higher eukaryotes have been characterized: ccr4/caf <dig> and pan2/pan <dig>  <cit> . while both activities are required for normal deadenylation in yeast, pan2/pan <dig> stops at the last 20–26-nt, perhaps due to its requirement for poly binding protein  as a cofactor, and only the ccr4/caf <dig> complex can process the last phase of deadenylation  <cit> . the pan2/pan <dig> complex has been identified in hela cells, where its activity is also stimulated by polyadenylate-binding protein   <cit> . thus, regulating the activity of one or the other deadenylase would have distinct effects on the rate of poly shortening and terminal deadenylation, and such a mechanism could account for the differential effects of mms and no on the rate of ho- <dig> mrna poly tail shortening and terminal deadenylation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have demonstrated nitric oxide-induced stabilization of ho- <dig> mrna in nih3t <dig> murine fibroblasts. ho- <dig> mrna stabilization in nih3t <dig> cells can also occur less dramatically in response to h2o <dig>  cdcl <dig> and naaso <dig>  the stabilizing effect of no on ho- <dig> did not appear to be due to a generalized inhibition of cellular mrna turnover, nor to the activation of an alternative transcriptional start site.

ho- <dig> mrna was deadenylated in both control and no-treated cells, and only slightly more slowly in the latter. in neither case were fully deadenylated transcripts detected, which suggests that poly shortening proceeds to a critical point, beyond which rapid decay of the entire mrna ensues. no appears to prevent the final shortening step, or possibly the subsequent decapping reaction. such a stabilization mechanism is distinct from the effect on ho- <dig> mrna stability of mms, which significantly decreases the poly shortening rate. a third agent, cdcl <dig>  induces ho- <dig> mrna transcriptionally without a significant effect on deadenylation, which is therefore mechanistically unlinked to transcription for ho- <dig>
