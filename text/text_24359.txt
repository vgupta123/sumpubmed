BACKGROUND
mitochondria are responsible for a number of metabolic tasks in eukaryotic cells. their primary function is to generate energy through oxidative phosphorylation in organelles. mitochondria also play an important role in other biological activities such as programmed cell death  <cit> , calcium signaling and generation of detoxification of reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

mitochondria consist of four subcompartments – an outer membrane, an inner membrane, an inter-membrane space and matrix. the chaperone proteins, and the translocase components, help mitochondrial transport into the subcompartments through their membranes  <cit> . during the cytoplasmic translation of mitochondrial proteins, they are recognized by chaperone proteins which interfere with the folding of the protein. a positively charged signal sequence, on the mitochondrial protein, then binds to the translocase components called translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane  located on the outer mitochondrial membrane  <cit> , the protein is moved into the tom complex. translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane   <cit> , is an inner membrane protein complex that forms a pore, and acts to pull the mitochondrial protein through the pore. on the inside of the pore, different chaperone proteins recognize the mitochondrial protein and fold it into a functional form. the signal sequence is removed by a mitochondrial signal peptidase as the mitochondrial protein enters the matrix.

the leucine zipper-, ef-hand-containing transmembrane protein  <dig>  is one of the mitochondrial proteins that is posttranslationally imported into the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> . this gene has been identified from the wolf-hirschhorn syndrome   <cit>  which is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation and mental retardation  <cit> . in almost all patients with whs, letm <dig> is part of a deletion found at the chromosome  <dig> location  <cit> . its role in whs may be based on mitochondrial k+ homeostasis  <cit> .

the human cervical cancer oncogene  has been isolated and identified as a human oncoprotein  <cit> ; it has revealed strong tumorigenic features in experiments on nude mice  <cit> . its role in tumorigenesis may be negative regulation of the p <dig> tumor suppressor gene  <cit> . hccr-transgenic mice have been shown to develop breast cancers and metastasis  <cit> . in order to investigate the functional role of hccr- <dig>  we predicted the biological features using bioinformatic tools. in addition, we identified the subcellular location and the targeting signal of hccr- <dig> 

RESULTS
hccr- <dig> has a letm <dig> homologous domain, and is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein
since hccr- <dig> has been shown to have tumorigenic features previously  <cit>  we focused on the biological functions of hccr- <dig> in the cell. in order to determine the functional domain of hccr- <dig> at the molecular level, pfam version  <dig>  was used to analyze its amino acid sequences and identified with the letm <dig> homologous domain at amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of hccr- <dig> . sequence alignment between the domain from hccr- <dig> and from the letm <dig> protein using clustalw  <cit>  showed a  <dig> % sequence similarity. from the analysis using pfam, we also identified several letm <dig> domain-containing proteins, in various eukaryotic species, from human through fungi as well as plant ; these findings suggest that the domain has widespread application in organisms and is well conserved during evolution, and that the letm <dig> domain may have an important biological function in the normal life cycle.

since some of the letm <dig> domain-containing proteins have been identified as mitochondrial proteins  <cit> , we analyzed the subcellular localization of the letm <dig> domain-containing proteins using the targetp version  <dig>   <cit>  and predotar version  <dig>   <cit> . as shown at table  <dig>  almost all proteins were predicted to be mitochondrial proteins with a high score . it strongly suggests that letm <dig> domain may play an important role in mitochondria.

mitochondrial targeting sequences were detected by targetp version  <dig>   <cit>  and predotar version  <dig>   <cit> . targetp calculates relative for mitochondrial localization. the reliability classes  of targetp provide a score from  <dig> to  <dig>  where  <dig> indicates the strongest prediction. predotar provides a probability estimate as to whether the sequence contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence. proteins with scores above  <dig>  are very probably targeted to the mitochondria.

hccr- <dig> is expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane
in order to examine the subcellular localization of hccr- <dig>  cdna was subcloned into a pegfp-n <dig> vector. cos- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells were cultured on a pre-coated coverslip and transiently transfected with the pegfp-n <dig> vector  or the vector carrying the human hccr- <dig> cdna . the cells were then further incubated for 24– <dig> h and their mitochondria were stained with mitotracker for  <dig> min at 37°c. the cells were fixed, mounted, and analyzed by confocal microscopy . we also used the hek <dig> cell line which stably expresses the v <dig> tagged hccr- <dig> . the cultured cells on the pre-coated coverslip were stained with mitotracker, fixed with 100% methanol for  <dig> min at -20°c. mouse anti-v <dig> antibody and goat anti-mouse igg antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase  were applied to the cells for  <dig> h at room temperature. the stained cells were mounted and analyzed by confocal microscopy . the hccr- <dig> fluorescence images revealed a staining pattern resembling mitochondria in all tested cell lines . the visualized mitochondria, as a result of incubation with a mitochondria-specific dye , were overlaid with hccr-1/gfp or hccr-1-v <dig>  while the vector alone  did not merge with the mitochondria; these findings suggest that hccr- <dig> is localized at the mitochondria.

sequence analysis of the hccr- <dig> protein, using the hopp-woods method of calculating hydrophilicity and tmhmm server version  <dig>   <cit> , revealed the presence of two hydrophobic segments, one extending from  <dig> to  <dig> residues which was predicted a transmembrane domain  and the other extending from position  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids which may be involved in anchoring to a membranous component. therefore, hccr- <dig> is predicted to be an integral membrane protein.

to examine whether hccr- <dig> is a mitochondrial membrane protein, the hek293/hccr-1-v <dig> cell lines were studied for subcelllular fractionation experiments. nuclear , post-mitochondrial supernatant , and mitochondrial  fractions were separated by differential centrifugation. the isolated mitochondria were solubilized by treatment with alkaline sodium carbonate  <cit>  and ultra-centrifuged to separate the soluble proteins  from the insoluble integral membrane proteins . each of the fractionated proteins were displayed by sds-page and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies to the v <dig> epitope , voltage dependant anion channel  <dig>  which is expressed on the mitochondrial membrane  <cit>   and superoxide dismutase- <dig>  on the mitochondrial matrix  <cit>  . the hccr- <dig> protein was found in the mitochondrial fraction  which is consistent with the previous result shown in figure 2a. treatment with alkaline sodium carbonate did not solubilize the mitochondrial integral membrane protein vdac- <dig> , but did disrupt the mitochondrial membrane as a result of exposing the matrix protein sod- <dig> . hccr- <dig> protein also remained in the pellet fraction ; these findings suggest that hccr- <dig> is exclusively localized in the mitochondrial membrane.

since hccr- <dig> was localized to the mitochondrial membrane, we evaluated the topological structure of hccr- <dig>  bioinformatic analyses using the tmhmm server version  <dig>   <cit> , showed that the nh2-terminus of hccr- <dig> is exposed to the cytoplasm, and also predicted that hccr- <dig> is a type ii integral membrane protein.

to examine the hccr- <dig> topology, the intact mitochondria were isolated from hek293/hccr-v <dig> cell lines and incubated with and without proteinase k or proteinase k plus triton x- <dig>  each treatment was subjected to sds-page and visualized by immunoblotting using antibodies to the v <dig> epitope , tom <dig> which expresses on the outer mitochondrial membrane  <cit>  , tim <dig> on the inner mitochondrial membrane  <cit>  , and sod- <dig> on the mitochondrial matrix . tim <dig> and sod- <dig> proteins were protease resistant in the mitochondria, which indicate that these proteins were not exposed to the surface. by contrast, tom <dig>  an outer membrane protein protruding to the surface, was sensitive to proteinase k and weakly detected by its polyclonal antibody . interestingly, the immunoblot analysis, using anti-v <dig> monoclonal antibody, detected two sized proteins – a full sized hccr-1-v <dig>  and a little smaller sized protein ; this indicates that the nh2-terminus of hccr- <dig> was partially degraded by the proteinase k, while the cooh-terminus of hccr- <dig>  containing v <dig> epitope, was protected from the protease activity in the intact mitochondria. this suggests that hccr- <dig> is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane . this result also suggests that the topological structure of hccr- <dig> is indeed consistent with the bioinformatic prediction as shown in figure 2d. upon disintegration of the membrane proteins by treatment with triton x- <dig>  all proteins were digested by proteinase k, showing that none of them was intrinsically protease-resistant .

mitochondrial targeting sequences are in the nh2-terminus of hccr-1
the targeting signal, on mitochondrial proteins, often exists on their dna fragments coding for the amino terminal region of the protein  <cit>  and does not have a conserved sequence, but rather share a common physical property. this feature is the ability to form an amphipathic α-helix, one in which positively charged amino acids are localized to one surface of the helix  <cit> . this signal sequence is recognized by the receptors on the mitochondrial outer membrane and imported into mitochondria. we have shown that hccr- <dig> is also a mitochondrial protein. this protein may be posttranslationally transported to mitochondria and then imported into mitochondria by recognition of the signal sequence.

to determine the mitochondrial targeting signal of hccr- <dig>  three different sizes of the nh2-teminal dna fragments were subcloned into a pegfp-n <dig> expression vector . each of the constructs was transfected into cos- <dig> cells and the mitochondria were stained and examined by confocal microscopy . hccr d1- <dig>  which contains nh2-terminal segments at positions  <dig> to  <dig> residues, was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and nuclei . this distribution is more like that of gfp alone . by contrast, the deletion mutants, hccr d1- <dig> and d1- <dig>  which contained at position  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> respectively, exhibited a typical mitochondrial pattern, and were overlaid with their mitochondrial staining ; this suggests that the d1- <dig> region which partially contains letm <dig> domain, contains the mitochondrial targeting sequence and d1- <dig> region alone cannot reach the mitochondria. we also tested these constructs in nih3t <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells, and obtained the same results as in cos- <dig> cells .

the d1- <dig> region of hccr- <dig> is required for its mitochondrial targeting
the 2nd structural analysis of the d1- <dig> region, using gor iv secondary structure prediction method  <cit> , identified an α-helical domain from  <dig> to  <dig> which belongs to letm <dig> domain of hccr- <dig> and this domain represented an amphipathic α-helical feature which often plays a role in the mitochondrial targeting signal  <cit> . to further characterize the hccr- <dig> targeting signal, the positions  <dig> to  <dig> were deleted from hccr d1- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> constructs . each construct was transfected into cos- <dig> cells and examined by confocal microscopy . the hccr d2- <dig> construct exhibited a diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm and nuclei resembling that of gfp alone in cos- <dig> cells . the hccr d2- <dig> construct contains an amphipathic α-helical domain. this construct also showed a diffuse distribution in cytoplasm and nuclei , which is different from the pattern of hccr d1- <dig>  and suggests that the nh2-terminal region from  <dig> to  <dig> is also required for mitochondrial targeting. however, some of the d2- <dig> mutant was transported to mitochondria , which suggests that this region between  <dig> and  <dig> as well as the region from  <dig> to  <dig> is involved in the mitochondrial targeting. when the hccr d2- <dig> construct was expressed in cos- <dig> cells, it was not detected in nuclei but in cytoplasm and other organelles . the d2- <dig> mutant contains the transmembrane domain which is moderately hydrophobic  <cit> . this may result in absence in nuclei and reaching into the mitochondria or other organelles  <cit> .

therefore, the mitochondrial localization of hccr- <dig> requires its d1- <dig> region, which partially belongs to the letm <dig> domain of hccr- <dig>  by contrast, d1- <dig> which contains nh2-terminus of hccr- <dig> and d2- <dig> which belongs the letm <dig> domain of hccr- <dig>  were prevented from localizing to mitochondria. this suggests that the d1- <dig> region may be co-related with the d2- <dig> region for mitochondrial targeting.

hccr d1- <dig> mutant was exclusively localized at the mitochondria
in order to confirm the previous results obtained by confocal microscopy experiments, cos- <dig> cells expressing hccr d1- <dig> and d2- <dig> were subjected to subcellular fractionation. nuclear , post-mitochondrial supernatant , and mitochondrial  fractions were separated by differential centrifugation, and analyzed by western blotting using antibodies to the gfp  and the mitochondrial membrane protein vdac- <dig> . as expected, the deleted mutant d1- <dig> was exclusively localized to the mitochondrial fraction , while the d2- <dig> exhibited all fractions . these data confirmed that the d1- <dig> domain is essential for the mitochondrial targeting of hccr- <dig> 

at the figure 4b and 5b, most of d2- <dig> and d2- <dig> mutants are located on mitochondria although some of them are failed to reach to mitochondria. this suggests that hccr- <dig> cytosolic form such as hccr- <dig> which is deleted at position  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, may exist. this cytosolic form could act as a negative regulator of p <dig> or could not. however, we propose that this form may not affect the hccr function because it may also mainly localize at mitochondria.

suppression of uvc- or staurosporine-induced apopotosis in hccr- <dig> overexpressed cell
to verify the role of hccr- <dig> on mitochondrial outer membrane and p <dig> negative regulation role, we used the hek <dig> cell line which stably expresses the vector alone  and v <dig> tagged hccr- <dig> , respectively. the cells were stimulated with the  <dig> j/m <dig> of the short-wave length light  ray,  <dig> nm staurosporine or  <dig> nm actinomycin d for trigging apoptosis. after the stimulation, the cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by facs. the cell number of apoptotic sub g0/g1-phase in the hek293/hccr- <dig> cells after treatment with uvc or staurosporine was less increased in comparing with that in hek <dig> and hek293/vector cells, in respectively . the cell number of apoptotic phase in the hek293/hccr- <dig> after treatment with actinomycin d was not significantly changed at all tested cell line . our flow cytometric data indicate that uvc or staurosporine induced-nuclear apoptosis is retarded in hek293/hccr- <dig> cells, which suggest that hccr- <dig> induces hek <dig> cells more resistance to uvc-ray and staurosporine-triggered apoptosis, but not in actinomycin d.

we have shown that overexpression of the cdna encoding hccr- <dig> led to the detection of the protein in mitochondira compartment in cos- <dig>  mcf- <dig> and hek- <dig> cells . however, the previous immunofluorescence study showed that hccr was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . interestingly, our resent analysis of hccr mrna using reverse transcription-pcr and sequencing has identified several hccr isoforms from various cancerous cell lines and tissues . the expression of these isoforms also depended on the cell type and tissues, while some of the isoforms were predicted to be different subcellular organelles. this could be invoked, for example, to account for the generation of the other cellular compartment pool of hccr.

hccr- <dig> has been isolated and identified as a strong oncoprotein with tumorigenic features  <cit> . interestingly, this protein has been localized to the mitochondrial membrane which has been deeply related to the intrinsic apoptotic signal  <cit> . here, we showed that the oncoprotein hccr- <dig> represses mitochondrial dysfunction caused by its uncontrolled expression. this may prevent the apoptotic signal, block the senescence, and induce cancer development. therefore, the present data now make it possible to investigate mitochondrial function and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in hccr- <dig> overexpressed cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we report that hccr- <dig> is a letm <dig> domain homologous protein and is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein. fluorescence microscopy and fractionation experiments showed that hccr- <dig> localizes to the mitochondria in cos- <dig>  mcf- <dig> and hek <dig> cell lines and subcompartamentally at its outer membrane in hek <dig> cell lines. its topology is revealed by the nh2-terminus of hccr- <dig> which is oriented toward the cytoplasm. we also demonstrated that the hccr d1- <dig> domain  is required and sufficient for posttranslational mitochondrial import. finally, the function of hccr- <dig> on mitochondrial membrane suppresses the intrinsic apoptotic signal which is induced by uvc and staurosporine, in respectively.
