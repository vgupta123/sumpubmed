BACKGROUND
rna ligase from phage t <dig>  the work horse of molecular biology research, is the best known member of a large protein family encompassing rna and dna ligation enzymes  <cit> . rna ligases fall into three classes:  rna ligases type  <dig>   rna ligases type  <dig>  and  capping enzymes. all nucleic acid ligases share a characteristic nucleotidyltransferase domain in their n-terminal part with five conserved motifs   <cit> . two other classes of enzymes that have rna ligase activity but lack the above structural features are the ligt phosphoesterases involved in rna splicing  and the recently identified rtcb proteins  <cit> . in the following, the term “rna ligase family” will refer to the two former classes that contain a nucleotidyltransferase domain.

rna ligase  <dig> enzymes are mainly present in viruses, mammals and fungi  <cit> . this enzyme class is typically involved in defense as exemplified by its founding member, the phage t <dig> rnl <dig>  which is deployed in the counter-attack against antiviral strategies of bacteria  <cit> , but is also involved in trna intron splicing  <cit>  and in the unconventional splicing initiating the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmatic reticulum. rna ligases  <dig> have a broad but punctuated distribution across the tree of life  <cit> : they are found mainly in viruses -with the archetypical example of t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  <cit> - and bacteria, while only a few examples are known in archaea and eukaryotes. the biological role of rna ligases  <dig> is unknown, except for the members of kinetoplastids  <cit> .

kinetoplastids  are a group of protozoans, some members of which are causing life-threatening human diseases   <cit> . these species also display a unique mitochondrial genome structure composed of an intricate network of large and small circular chromosomes  <cit> . large chromosomes encode typical mitochondrial protein-coding genes. small circles specify guide rnas that serve as proofreading templates for editing pre-mrnas of mitochondrial genes  <cit> . editing proceeds by cutting the pre-mrna molecule at the place of the mismatch, then adding or removing uridines, and finally religating the two parts of the rna molecule. it is this last step that is performed by rna ligase  <dig>  specifically, two different rna ligases  <dig> are involved, one dedicated to adding and the second to deleting uridines as exemplified by the ligases tbrel <dig> and tbrel <dig> respectively for trypanosoma brucei  <cit> .

here we report the identification of a putative new member of the rna ligase  <dig> family in diplonema papillatum, a member of diplonemids , which are the sister group of kinetoplastids. the corresponding gene was discovered in our search of a candidate enzyme involved in the eccentric post-transcriptional processing in diplonema mitochondria  <cit> . this protist harbors a highly complex mitochondrial genome sharing certain similarities with that of kinetoplastids. first, the diplonema mitochondrial dna  is also multi-partite, as it is composed of hundreds of circular chromosomes of two size classes. the difference and uniqueness of the diplonemid mtdna is that each chromosome contains one short coding region specifying a fragment of a gene. each gene module is transcribed separately and then trans-spliced to form full-length mrnas or structural rnas. the second resemblance with kinetoplastid mitochondria is rna editing  <cit> . uridine insertion and deletion editing in kinetoplastids involves an rna ligase  <dig> to reseal the transcript. in diplonema, rna editing proceeds by uridine appendage at certain module ends, prior to trans-splicing. we hypothesize that an ancestral molecular machinery containing rna ligase  <dig> has led to the editosome in kinetoplastids, while it has evolved to perform trans-splicing in the diplonemid branch.

rna ligases  <dig> consist of two discrete portions: the n-terminal nucleotidyltransferase domain  and a c-terminal domain  responsible for substrate specificity. the ligation reaction of rna ligase  <dig> is atp and mg2+ dependent  <cit>  and proceeds, like all members of the dna/rna ligase family, in three steps. during the first step, atp adenylates the enzyme on the lysine residue of the conserved kxxg tetramer in motif i of the nucleotidyltransferase domain. in step  <dig>  the covalently linked amp is transferred to the 5′p of the ‘downstream’ rna molecule to be ligated. finally, the 3′oh of the ‘upstream’ rna molecule attacks the 5′p of the ‘downstream’ rna by releasing amp and joining the two rna molecules . the crystal structure has been determined for only a few family members, notably t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  <cit>  and one of the two paralogous mitochondrial rna ligases  <dig> from trypanosoma brucei, notably in apo form as well as complexed with a magnesium ion and atp  <cit> .

in this study, we devise a strategy based on hidden markov models  and structural comparisons to identify proteins of large evolutionary distance to well-studied counterparts in model organisms. comparative analysis of highly diverged homologs is particularly informative for identifying functionally and structurally important residues that are under elevated selective pressure. employing this analytic strategy, we identify the gene and model the structure and ligand interactions of a putative rna ligase  <dig> from diplonema. the model predicts intriguing innovations in the interaction network between atp and the residues of the catalytic pocket, which are worthwhile to be tested experimentally by resolving the crystal structure. we discuss possible evolutionary scenarios that led to these innovations.

RESULTS
hmm-based detection of a divergent rna ligase  <dig> in diplonema
in general, proteins of d. papillatum display a low level of sequence similarity with homologs of other taxa, and are difficult to identify with tools based on sequence similarity such as blast  <cit> . therefore we employed more sensitive methods based on hidden markov models . we used the hmm pf <dig>  from the protein family database   <cit> , a model that was built based on rna ligases  <dig> from all domains of life including mitochondrial rna ligases  <dig> of kinetoplastids. we identified one candidate protein, dp28902_ <dig>  in the conceptual translation of the diplonema draft genome assembly . expression of this open reading frame was confirmed by rnaseq experiments. the corresponding transcript is poly-adenylated and its steady-state level is about 1/ <dig> compared to the expression of aspartyl trna synthase.

for comparison, we also used hmms for other rna and dna ligase super-families in searches against dp28902_ <dig> and rna ligases  <dig> of trypanosoma  and the heterolobosean naegleria gruberi. naegleria was chosen because heteroloboseans are the sistergroup of euglenozoa, and because sequences of this taxon have not been used in building the pfam hmm. table  <dig> summarizes the corresponding e-values. dp28902_ <dig> has the lowest e-value with the pf <dig> model, a value that is  <dig> times smaller than the second-best match, which was obtained with the hmm of atp-dependent dna ligases. models for proteins that have a different fold  did not yield significant e-values  for either dp28902_ <dig> or the rna ligases  <dig> of trypanosoma. therefore, dp28902_ <dig> most likely belongs to the rna ligase  <dig> family and will be referred to as dprnl.table  <dig> identification of the ligase family to which belongs dprnla

dprnl contains a nucleotidyltransferase domain typical for rna ligases 2
the rna/dna ligase super-family is characterized by a nucleotidyltransferase domain including five subdomains   <cit>  located in the n-terminal portion of the protein. we demonstrate the presence of these motifs in dprnl by three different methods: sequence alignment against pfam hmm ; multiple sequence alignment of dprnl and rna ligases  <dig> from kinetoplastids, enterobacteriphage t <dig>  and naegleria ; and structural alignment of dprnl with rna ligases  <dig> for which the three-dimensional  structure has been experimentally determined, notably from trypanosoma brucei, the phage t <dig>  and the archaean pyrococcus abyssii .fig.  <dig> delineation of the nucleotidyltransferase domain. multiple alignment of rna ligases  <dig> from enterobacteriophage t <dig> , diplonema papillatum , naegleria gruberi , and four kinetoplastids, leishmania infantum jpcm <dig> , l. major friedlin , trypanosoma vivax y <dig> , and t. brucei treu <dig> . the six sub-domains  highlighted in orange, cyan, green, blue, yellow and red, respectively are clearly detectable in dprnl

while the five subdomain motifs are well conserved across all rna ligases  <dig> and readily recognizable in dprnl, the rest of the n-terminal portion of the diplonema protein shows only low sequence similarity to established rna ligases  <dig> . dprnl lacks portions of two loops between domains iii and iiia  163– <dig> and aa 176–205) that are distinctive for kinetoplastid rna ligases  <dig>  and that have been shown to interact with rna  <cit> . also missing from dprnl is the loop between domains iiia and iv of tbrel <dig> , a loop that has been predicted to interact with other proteins of the editosome  <cit> . finally, the c-terminal portion of dprnl  has no recognizable resemblance with, and its length is also shorter than the corresponding region of other rna ligases  <dig> 

the 3d model of apo-dprnl possesses all structural features typical for rna ligases 2
the global three-dimensional  model of dprnl was predicted by i-tasser  <cit>   and validated with saves . nearly all  amino acids have a stereochemical conformation in the “favored” or “allowed” regions of the ramachandran plot. only the seven most c-terminal residues are in an unfavorable environment according to the assessment by the tool verify-3d  <cit> . while the per-residue analysis of modfold  <cit>  also found lower quality scores for the c-terminal region, the overall p-value of the model  is highly confident. the estimated tm-score obtained from the standard output of i-tasser was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . a tm-score > <dig>  usually indicates a model of correct topology, and a tm-score < <dig>  means a similarity no better than random. as a whole, the topology of the i-tasser model of dprnl is of good quality.fig.  <dig> three-dimensional model of dprnl inferred by i-tasser. the five nucleotidyltransferase sub-domains are represented in color



the 3d model of dprnl is characterized by a core of anti-parallel-twisted β sheets decorated with apical α helices. two structural sub-domains with similar composition are facing one another. one contains the two extremities of the molecule and consists of an anti-parallel β sheet of four β strands and four α helices. the other sub-domain, corresponding to the middle part of the protein, has six β strands and three α helices. the interface between these two sub-domains forms the catalytic pocket of the protein, with the residues of the five nucleotidyltransferase motifs pointing to the pocket’s cavity. from the inside to the outside are located motifs i, iv and v on one side, and motifs iiia, iii and ii on the other, the two sides facing each other.

molecular dynamics simulations confirm the stability of the dprnl 3d model
to assess the stability of the proposed dprnl model and the relative flexibility of the structural domains, we performed a 50-ns molecular dynamics  simulation. the root mean square deviation  of the backbone α-carbon atoms remained stable after 10 ns of simulation with a mean of  <dig>  Å .

when monitoring the secondary  structure conservation during the simulation , we observed that the β sheets, which are buried inside the protein, are more stable, whereas the α helices and loops, which are peripheral, are more flexible as reflected by the high root mean square fluctuation  values of the corresponding residues. specifically, certain residues of the α helices  transiently adopted a 3– <dig> helix conformation. flexible α helices and loops are also observed in tbrel <dig> of trypanosoma, where the exposed regions of the protein interact with the rna substrate and with other proteins of the editosome  <cit> . therefore, the flexible peripheral regions of dprnl presumably play a functional role as well.

the c-terminal region of dprnl is linked to the rest of the molecule by a flexible loop, but this region displays less motion than expected. this is because the c-terminal domain is entangled in a network of hydrogen bonds with more n-terminal amino acids. most stable are the interactions between the carboxyl group of tyrosine at position  <dig>  and the lateral chain of two other residues , as well as between the lateral chains of dprnl_y <dig> and dprnl_q <dig>  additional stabilization of this domain comes from a hydrogen bond involving the carbonyl group of dprnl_k <dig> in the main chain and the hydroxyl of dprnl_s <dig>  in conclusion, the 3d model of dprnl is stable both at the 2d and 3d level. the observed flexibility parallels that of other rna ligases  <dig>  <cit> , providing strong support for dprnl being a functional member of this protein family.

3d structure comparison of dprnl with well characterized rna ligases 2
compared to recognized rna ligases  <dig>  dprnl is more conserved in 3d structure than in sequence. nevertheless, the β strands of dprnl are generally shorter than those of its counterparts, resulting in a 15–30 % shorter nucleotidyltransferase domain compared to the enzymes of trypanosoma or phage t <dig>  pairwise structural comparison with experimentally confirmed structures  reveals only a moderate fit of dprnl with tbrel <dig> , although kinetoplastids are the sister group of diplonemids. the fit is slightly better with the rna ligases of t <dig>  and pyrococcus abyssii , and the putative dna ligase from aquifex aeolicus . note that pab <dig> was initially annotated as dna ligase, but more recent experimental studies shown that it catalyzes the ligation of rna  <cit> .

the proteins from pyrococcus and aquifex are both homodimeric with subunits being held together through the interaction of two peripheral α helices  <cit> . as dprnl has no region whose sequence resembles that of these interacting helices, we investigated if the two most c-terminal helices of dprnl allow dimerization through typical hydrophobic interface contacts  <cit> . the hydrophobicity map of exposed residues  shows that the c-terminal helices of dprnl do not have the propensity to form an hydrophobic surface comparable to that of the archaean ligases. this suggests that dprnl is active in a monomeric state as are tbrel <dig> and t4rnl <dig> fig.  <dig> protein properties mapped onto dprnl. a localisation of the five nucleotidyltransferase sub-domains. b amino acids conserved across the rna ligase  <dig> family. the value  <dig>  represents highest conservation. c exceptional residues as determined in this work. d hydrophobicity. e electrostatic potential



to determine if the nucleotidyltransferase domain of dprnl contains deviant residues otherwise not found in rna and dna ligases, we computed a score of «exceptionality» along the structural multiple alignment from selected enzymes including archaeal and kinetoplastid homologs. each amino acid in diplonema was assigned an exceptionality score based on the proportion of residues in the corresponding alignment column having common physicochemical properties in other ligases . the amino acid with the highest score is the tyrosine dprnl_y <dig>  a position occupied in all other cases by a different, generally aliphatic residue. the second most deviant amino acid is the valine dprnl_v <dig>  whose position is generally occupied by a basic residue that non-covalently binds amp in reaction step  <dig>  <cit> . further exceptional residues in dprnl are s <dig>  g <dig>  w <dig>  w <dig>  d <dig>  y <dig> and r <dig>  the consequences of these substitutions for interactions with rna and atp will be discussed in a later section.

phylogeny of rna ligases 2
the moderate structural similarity of dprnl with rna ligases  <dig> from the diplonemid sister group raised questions about the phylogenetic relationship of these proteins. we focused our analyses on excavate taxa, because a broader taxonomic sampling would have resulted in sequences too diverse for meaningful phylogenetic reconstruction. the inferred tree  shows well supported grouping of kinetoplastid rna ligases  <dig>  which are split into two subgroups corresponding to the two paralogs . the subgroup clustering strongly suggests a duplication of rna ligases  <dig> in the kinetoplastid branch prior to the speciation of leishmania and trypanosoma. in contrast, the phylogenetic position of dprnl in the tree has virtually no support, and the observed affiliation with a homolog from naegleria  might be an artifact known as long-branch attraction  <cit> . the phylogenetic reconstruction in this instance suffers from lack of taxa within euglenozoa , and from low sequence conservation. nevertheless, the tree indicates that dprnl diverged prior to the gene duplication event seen in kinetoplastids, and that this protein has no specific relationship to the kinetoplastid rna ligases  <dig> that take part in mitochondrial rna editing.

dprnl is predicted to interact with rna in a t4-like fashion
rna ligases  <dig> interact with their substrate via two regions of the protein, the c-terminal domain and regions of the n-terminal nucleotidyltransferase domain that have a positive electrostatic potential. substrate interaction of the c-terminal domain in kinetoplastid rna ligases  <dig> is indirect: the four helices bind a protein partner carrying an ob-fold that, in turn, interacts with the substrate. for example, tbrel <dig> recruits krepa <dig>  and tbrel <dig> associates with krepa <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the c-terminal domain of t4rnl <dig> alone suffices for efficiently binding the substrate. in dprnl, the c-terminal domain carries only two short helices making a tbrel_krepa-like interaction unlikely. in having a positive electrostatic potential and being rich in residues able to interact with rna, the c-terminal domain of dprnl resembles that of t4rnl <dig>  <cit>  , and probably also interacts directly with the rna substrate.

we mentioned earlier that the nucleotidyltransferase domain of dprnl lacks the two substrate-binding loops of kinetoplastid rna ligases  <dig>  rna interaction of loop  <dig>  and loop  <dig>  had been predicted based on the crystal structure  <cit>  and the calculation of the ensemble averaged electrostatic potential  <cit> , and has been confirmed by an rna ligation assay with an n-terminal fragment of tbrel <dig> containing these two loops  <cit> . the same study also shows that the equivalent n-terminal portion of t4-rnl <dig>  which lacks these loops, does not display this activity. again, substrate interaction in the diplonema protein must be different from that in kinetoplastid rna ligases  <dig> and rather similar to that of t4rnl <dig> 

in the nucleotidyltransferase domain of the phage t4rna ligase  <dig>  rna interaction is achieved by a patch of positively charged residues located in the exposed region of central beta sheets, as revealed by the crystal structure of t4rnl <dig> bound to a nicked nucleic acid duplex . to identify such regions in dprnl, we computed the electrostatic potential at the solvent-accessible surface of the protein . we found a large region in dprnl’s nucleotidyltransferase domain with strong positive potential  <cit>  . superposition of the dprnl 3d model onto the t4rnl <dig> structure with bound rna duplex shows that the potential is distributed in a pattern similar to that in t4rnl <dig>  and in addition, that the duplex broadly overlaps the positively charged regions of dprnl . however, this region in dprnl is not completely covered by the duplex. either the substrate is slightly shifted and|or the unoccupied region interacts with another partner. still, in this superposition, the two c-terminal helices of the diplonema protein wrap themselves around the nucleic acid like a hook, corroborating the predicted position of the rna substrate in the dprnl model.

refinement of the dprnl structural model by molecular dynamics simulations
rna ligases  <dig> typically bind atp in a covalent fashion during the first step of the catalysis resulting in a ligase-amp complex . in a previous section we reported that certain conserved residues otherwise involved in the covalent attachment of amp, are substituted by different amino acids in dprnl. to investigate how dprnl might interact with atp, we performed an md simulation after introducing an atp molecule together with a magnesium ion into the catalytic pocket of the 3d model to mimic the situation at the beginning of the first step of the enzymatic reaction. our approach has been validated by a control simulation with tbrel <dig>  where atp and mg2+ assumed stable positions in the catalytic pocket that correspond to those in the crystal structure  <cit> .

md simulations were performed for  <dig> and 45 ns. we restrained the position of atp in the catalytic pocket during the first 15 ns  followed by four replicates of unrestrained md simulation during 35 ns. second, we conducted three independent atp-restrained productions of 15 ns, each followed by 30 ns unrestrained md simulation in order to test whether atp adopts each time the same position . we observed that the most important fluctuations during the entire simulation period took place in peripheral helices and loops, while the core β strands stabilized already during the first 10 ns . however, the conformation of the catalytic pocket was primarily influenced by the subtle motion of lateral chains in the core β strands that took place during the first 10-ns pre-production phase. in particular, the motion of the residues dprnl_f <dig> and dprnl_y <dig>  which are among the five residues with the lowest rmsf, had the strongest impact, reshaping the whole interaction network with atp. interestingly, dprnl_y <dig>  which in the initial structure was perpendicular to atp, turned around to face both the adenine ring and dprnl_f <dig>  this rotation occurred already during the md equilibration phase, and the new position of this residue was retained for the rest of the simulation time in six of the seven replicates. a distinct conformation was adopted by the last replicate for which the number of distance violations during the atp-restrained production phase was much higher , and atp is more distant from both aromatic residues  with a mean angle of 52°  with dprnl_f <dig> . such a conformation is incompatible with π-stacking. the conformation obtained by the six consistent simulations will be referred to as the predominant conformation and analyzed in the following sections, while the deviant conformation will be addressed in the discussion. to summarize, in the predominant 3d model of dprnl, the pre-production phase locked the catalytic core of the protein in a stable conformation that favors interaction with atp.

predicted interactions of dprnl with adenine and ribose of atp
we compared the predicted interaction network of atp in the dprnl model with that intbrel <dig>  which is the only enzyme for which both the crystal structure of the protein bound to atp , and detailed molecular dynamics simulations are available  <cit> . atp interactions of t4rnl <dig> are similar to those of tbrel <dig>   <cit> .

the phenylalanine  and tyrosine , which together sequester the adenine base of atp in the dprnl model, establish a π-π stacking interaction with the substrate. this contrasts with the tbrel <dig> structure, where the base is enclosed by a sandwich composed of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine , and a valine . in the diplonema protein the valine is replaced by a tyrosine , a residue determined as highly exceptional by comparative analysis . this stabilizing interaction reduces greatly the degrees of freedom of the atp molecule, and gives a significant turn to the interactions in the catalytic pocket by shifting the position of the ligand in dprnl compared to well characterized rna ligases. additional atp stabilization in dprnl comes from two hydrogen bonds implicating the amine group of atp. one hydrogen contacts the carbonyl group of dprnl_e <dig>  and the other the lateral chain of dprnl_e <dig> .

in tbrel <dig>  the ribose of the atp is bound by five residues  allowing the sugar moiety only little mobility. four out of these five residues  are conserved in the diplonema protein , but only two of the counterparts  interact with the ribose of atp . interactions in the dprnl model take place indirectly through water molecules, and are weaker than the direct salt bridges in tbrel <dig>  thus allowing the larger motions of the sugar that we observed. the two conserved residues that are not involved in stabilizing the sugar  play an equally important role as detailed in the following.fig.  <dig> catalytic pocket of dprnl and tbrel <dig>  a dprnl. b 1xdn. dashed lines represent interactions  with the adenine ring. important residues are in color



the triphosphate tail of atp engages in a rich network of stabilizing interactions
in the predicted predominant conformation of dprnl, the triphosphate tail of atp is stabilized by a network of interactions with three basic residues . in tbrel <dig>  the triphosphate tail is held in place by five residues, tbrel1_i <dig>  tbrel1_k <dig>  tbrel1_r <dig>  tbrel1_k <dig> and tbrel1_r <dig> . among these latter residues, only tbrel1_k <dig> has the same 3d position and plays the same role as predicted for dprnl-k <dig>  while tbrel1_i <dig> has no positional counterpart in dprnl. the remaining three amino acids have a positional homolog in the dprnl model, but apparently a different function compared to the trypanosome protein .fig.  <dig> structurally and functionally equivalent residues in dprnl, tbrel <dig> and t4rnl <dig>  residues on the same line are structural equivalents . residues having the same functional role are connected with an arrow. dotted arrows indicate partial functional equivalence. x, no functional equivalent was identified. residues in grey seem not to play a functional role. atp-a: adenine of atp; atp-ribose: ribose of atp; atp-pa, pb, pg: phosphate alpha, beta, and gamma, respectively of atp; *: essential residue; **: exceptional residue; −/−, no structural equivalent identified



tbrel1_k <dig> is the catalytic lysine that in reaction step  <dig> will covalently bind atp. this reaction is favored by strong salt bridges between atp and several other amino acids. dprnl_k <dig>  the structural equivalent to tbrel1_k <dig>  forms several salt bridges with residues dprnl_e <dig>  dprnl_g <dig> and dprnl_v <dig>  but instead of promoting the covalent attachment of atp, the interactions of dprnl_k <dig> appear to rather pull this residue away from atp, the computed distance between dprnl_k20-nz and pα being on average  <dig>  Å . a candidate residue for covalently binding atp could be dprnl_k <dig>  owing to its position apical to the pα at an average distance of  <dig>  Å. this distance is comparable to that observed in tbrel <dig> between k <dig> and pα. we propose that the unusual position of atp in the dprnl model, as well as the posited substitution of the catalytic lysine, are due to dprnl_y <dig>  which, by transforming a simple to a double π-stacking interaction, shifts the position of the ligand.

tbrel1_r <dig> interacts with the triphosphate tail of atp, and therefore, the functional homolog of this residue is thought to be dprnl_r <dig>  however, the positional counterpart of the former residue in our model  plays a radically different role, rather forming hydrogen bridges with residues in the c-terminal region of the protein . it should be stressed that all simulations with tbrel <dig> have been performed with a sequence lacking the c-terminal domain , so that interactions with the c-terminal domain are not known. in t <dig>  the crystal structure of the adenylated full-length enzyme revealed a salt bridge between two residues of the c domain, r <dig> and d <dig>  probably reinforcing its structural integrity  <cit> .

finally, tbrel1_r <dig> as well interacts with the triphosphate tail of atp, and in the homologous position of this residue, we find in the dprnl model a valine . however, this valine seems not to interact with atp or any amino acid of the catalytic pocket. the functional homolog of tbrel1_r <dig> is rather dprnl_r <dig>  note that both dprnl_v <dig> and dprnl_r <dig>  are “exceptional” residues, and that a non-basic residue at the position corresponding to v <dig> in t4rnl <dig> was demonstrated to prevent ligation of atp  <cit> ). the implications of these findings will be considered in the discussion section.

discussion
in the search of an enzyme responsible for the unique trans-splicing in mitochondria of diplonemids, we identified a candidate rna ligase  <dig> in the d. papillatum genome sequence. detection of this candidate required the most sensitive hmm search method, because molecular sequences of diplonemids are in general highly divergent  <cit> .

to confirm the sequence-based gene assignment, we constructed a preliminary 3d model of dprnl that we aligned with rna ligase  <dig> family members. based on the structural sequence alignment, we delineated the boundaries of the predicted functional domains of the diplonema protein. to pinpoint deviant amino acids in the 3d model of dprnl, we computed a score of exceptionality for each residue. the preliminary structural model was refined by first, eliminating structural inconsistencies and second, performing molecular dynamics simulation. the final model was compared with well-characterized rna ligases  <dig> 

available information on how rna ligases  <dig> interact with their substrate and atp comes from crystal structure analysis and enzymatic assays of trypanosome tbrel <dig> and bacteriophage t4rnl <dig>  in contrast, the presented ligand-binding mode of dprnl was inferred from molecular dynamics simulations that were based on an in-silico modeled 3d structure of the protein. homology models built from a template that is very distant in sequence space are usually less reliable and tend to be biased toward the template. even if the main chains of residues interacting with atp are correctly placed in the dprnl model, misplacement of their side chains may influence the simulation of ligand binding. to alleviate these difficulties, we have refined the homology model using extensive md simulation, and have tested the resulting structure using several metrics . the predicted unusual atp-binding mode in the diplonema protein must be considered with this precautionary note in mind.

how the postulated rewiring of atp interactions in dprnl may have evolved
the present model of dprnl indicates a reorganization of residue-residue and residue-atp interactions in the catalytic pocket compared to other ligases, entailing that  the ribose is less firmly stabilized than in tbtel <dig> and t4rnl <dig>   the conserved lysine dprnl_k <dig> in motif i is pulled away from atp, and  atp is now contacted by the conserved lysine dprnl_k <dig> in motif v. such a reshaping would most likely impact steps  <dig> and  <dig> of the catalysis .

evolution of such reorganization in the catalytic pocket of dprnl would require at least two consecutive steps. we speculate that initially, the nearly neutral mutation of a valine to tyrosine dprnl_y <dig>  was made possible by the subsidiary presence of the lysine dprnl_k <dig>  which incidentally replaced the original catalytic lysine . in this intermediary step, the system could have reverted back to its previous organization. yet, the accumulation of mutations in a second step  led to a state with no way back, in the manner of a ratchet  <cit> . such a two-step scenario is archetypal of the constructive neutral evolutionary process  <cit> .

as mentioned before, two residues highly conserved at the structural level are predicted to have a different function in dprnl compared to orthodox rna ligases  <dig>  these are the ubiquitous lysine  and arginine , which correspond in the structure alignment to dprnl_k <dig> and dprnl_r <dig>  respectively . conservation of the residues in diplonema but not their predicted function raises the question about the underlying selection pressure. interestingly, the catalytic lysine of proven rna ligases  <dig> , has been suggested to also interact with the rna substrate, notably in the reaction step  <dig>  <cit>  . therefore, we speculate that both dprnl_k <dig> and dprnl_r <dig>  may be subject to a negative selection in favor of conserving a second yet unrecognized role. the key message is that the observation of constant sites across an otherwise diverse family is not necessarily indicative of an identical molecular function of the corresponding residues, as residues can play multiple  roles in the corresponding protein  <cit> .

the biological process involving dprnl
we found that sequence- and structure-wise, mitochondrial rna ligases  <dig> of kinetoplastids are not the closest homologs of dprnl. specifically, the 3d-structure model of dprnl does not fit better the structure of tbrel compared to that of rna ligases  <dig> from a bacteriophage or an archaean. further, phylogenetic analysis of rna ligases  <dig> did not group together the kinetoplastid and diplonemid proteins, but placed dprnl without support next to a member of the heteroloboseans, a group that emerged prior to euglenozoa. the large distance between kinetoplastid rna ligases and dprnl is probably due to a divergent, accelerated evolution and hyper-specialization of both the kinetoplastid and diplonema proteins. therefore, we cannot extrapolate from tbrel the biological process in which dprnl may be involved.

at present it is unknown whether or not dprnl acts inside mitochondria. there is no recognizable signal in the inferred protein sequence indicative for import into mitochondria or any other subcellular localisation. after translation, dprnl may either remain in the cytoplasm or be imported into mitochondria by one of the cryptic signals reported for proteins of several other eukaryotes  <cit> . if dprnl indeed ends up in mitochondria, then its interaction partner must be fundamentally different to those of the kinetoplastid tbrel, because of significant structural differences between the two proteins . our in silico analyses have prepared the ground for determining experimentally the location of dprnl in the cell, the protein and rna partners with which it may interact, and ultimately, via ‘guilt by association’ , the biological process in which it participates.

CONCLUSIONS
rna ligase  <dig> from bacteriophage t <dig> is widely used as a tool in molecular biology, in particular for massively parallelized rna sequencing technologies. enzyme versions have been engineered with higher efficiency and fidelity than the natural protein. specifically, the truncated version of the rna ligase from phage t <dig> produces less concatemer side products and is  <dig> times more active than the natural enzyme  <cit> . further, attempts have been undertaken to abolish concatemer formation of t <dig> rna ligase by directed mutation of specific amino acids   <cit> . comparative analysis with divergent rna ligases such as dprnl are bound to reveal unrecognized evolution-born innovations and to pinpoint residues otherwise not expected to be relevant enzymatically. our in-silico analysis suggests that dprnl activity relies on structure-function innovations not present in the commonly used rna ligases, which might reveal suitable for future applications in biotechnology.
