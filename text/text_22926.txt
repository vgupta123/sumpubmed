BACKGROUND
linking genotypic variation to phenotypic variation is one of the most challenging aspects of contemporary genome research. while several studies have found that single nucleotide polymorphisms  can have drastic effects on phenotype  <cit> , these types of variation are unlikely to solely explain the large phenotypic diversity found at the inter and intra specific level. recent genomic studies have shown that variations, other than snps, such as structural variations  also play a prominent role in phenotypic evolution  <cit> .

polymorphic svs may lead to different copy number of specific genomic regions within a population. these regions are often called copy number variable regions  and can range from  <dig> bases up to several megabases   <cit> . cnvrs constitute roughly 5-12% of the human genome  <cit>  and have been recognized as a source of phenotypic variation including susceptibility to specific diseases  <cit> . duplication of genic regions can also result in evolution of new genes and gene functions that can have a significant impact on phenotypes  <cit> . for example, duplication of the ccl3l <dig> gene can protect an individual against contracting hiv and developing aids  <cit>  and a partial duplication of the slit-robo rho gtphase-activating protein  <dig> gene , some around  <dig> million years ago , created a novel gene function associated with cognitive abilities in humans  <cit> .

in domestic animals the best-known examples of traits that are affected by cnvrs pertain the animal exterior. for instance, a duplication of the agouti signaling protein gene  in sheep results in a different pigmentation  <cit> . the duplication of a set of fibroblast growth factor  genes in dogs leads to a characteristic dorsal hair ridge  <cit> . a copy number gain of the region containing the kit gene causes the dominant white/patch coat phenotype observed in different european pig breeds  <cit> . thus, the association of cnvrs with distinct large effects in species that very recently have undergone strong phenotypic alteration, most notably domesticated animals in the past  <dig> thousand years, raises the question of how rapid phenotypic alteration may be related to  structural variation in genomes.

sus scrofa  diverged from other sus species some  <dig> mya and started to spread, from southeast asia, into the rest of its currently natural occurrence across most of the eurasia about  <dig>  -  <dig>  mya . such a large bio-geographic range will result in a wide range of local adaptation that, in part, may be related to cnvrs. domestication can be seen as a long lasting genetic experiment  <cit> , and in the case of pigs has been carried out on the same wild ancestral species independently at least once in europe and once in asia  <cit> . independent domestication implies independent breeding practices in europe and asia for several thousand years. historical records revealed that breeding was more intensive in asia than in europe for centuries  <cit> . different breeding regime led to intensive trading of breeds between europe and asia, especially at the onset of the industrial revolution when europeans massively imported asian breeds  <cit> . since the wild ancestor is still present throughout the entire natural range, among domesticated species, sus scrofa provides a well suitable framework for studying effects of both adaptation and domestication on mammalian genome structure, such as cnvrs.

the recent completion of the porcine genome  <cit>  and the advent of high-throughput sequencing methods, now allow for a comprehensive screen of variation, including structural variation in the pig. although several different methods e.g. snp arrays and array cgh have been applied to screen for svs, methods based on next generation sequencing  technology in general, and read depth  based methods  <cit>  in particular, revealed better performance in detecting cnvrs. the advantage of this approach is seen especially in and near highly duplicated genomic regions, such as segmental duplications  where most of the array based methods fail  <cit> .

in this study the rd method was applied on ngs data of  <dig> sus scrofa individuals, representing the diversity of both wild and domesticated pigs, firstly to detect svs/cnvs in the pig genome and secondly to relate the evolution of svs/cnvs to pig genomics features and to population/domestication histories.

RESULTS
data selection, copy number detection and definition of multi copy regions
in this study,  <dig> pigs were selected to cover a broad representation of pig diversity of both wild and domestic pigs. the selection of samples included three wild boars from asia and three from europe and five domesticated individuals from asia and five from europe . whole genome re-sequenced data were obtained for the  <dig> samples with the average coverage per sample varying between 7x and 11x. reads were aligned against the porcine reference genome  using mrsfast  <cit> . the rd method  <cit>  was used to detect copy numbers  in the  <dig> pig individuals . from the estimated cn we defined regions of cn gains ) as regions ≥  <dig> kilobases  and cn >  <dig>  we detected  <dig>  mcrs in the  <dig> individuals with individual numbers of mcrs ranging from  <dig>  in an asian domestic  to  <dig>  in a european wild boar . the average number of mcrs per individual was  <dig>  covering  <dig>  mb . the size of the mcrs identified varied from the predefined minimum of  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb with an average size of  <dig> kb. the majority of mcrs was found to be common in all  <dig> individuals. the number of mcrs that were found specific to single individual ranged from 0– <dig>  regions of cn loss were also identified, but we observed a positive correlation between sequence depth and regions of cn loss. with the used sequence coverage, this resulted in a considerable numbers of false positive cn losses  and it was therefore decided to exclude cn losses from further analyses.

copy number variable regions among pigs
cnvrs can be identified by comparing cn of the overlapping mcrs in different individuals. we identified  <dig>  mcrs with their corresponding cn in the  <dig> individuals. the standard deviation  of cn of each mcr was calculated and mcrs with a s.d. ≥ <dig>  among the  <dig> individuals were regarded as cnvrs. in total,  <dig>  putative cnvrs were obtained with an average size of  <dig> kb, comprising  <dig>  mb of the porcine genome . the cnvr density per chromosome varies from  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % on chromosome  <dig> .

experimental validation
we evaluated the accuracy of cnvrs prediction by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction . ten genic cnvrs, ten non-genic cnvrs and four diploid regions were randomly selected and tested using two distinct primer sets per locus.  <dig> of the  <dig> assays were successful and for those we found 100% agreement with our cnvrs predictions indicating a low false discovery call of cnvrs by the methodology and thresholds used in our analysis. details of the qpcr primers can be found in additional file 4: table s4c. we also compared the predicted cnvrs with known cnvrs. the region in chromosome  <dig> containing the kit gene in the pig genome, which is known to be copy number variable between different european breeds confirms our results  <cit>  .

association of cnvrs with genomic features
segmental duplications   act as promoter of cnvrs by facilitating non-allelic homologous recombination  <cit> . we compared the overlap between cnvrs with a list of  <dig>  sds previously identified in the pig genome  <cit> . we found that approximately  <dig> % of sds  were overlapping within the  <dig> kb flanking region of cnvrs. both the cnvrs and sds appear to be non-randomly distributed across the genome . highly repetitive sequences such as retrotransposons were also investigated for their correlation with cnvrs. the frequencies of major retrotransposon families were calculated by counting the number of bases of these elements in the  <dig> kb flanking regions of cnvrs and sd separately . we observed significant enrichments of line-l <dig> , ltr-erv <dig>  and satellite elements  near cnvrs and sds .

the guanine/cytosine  content of cnvrs and  <dig> kb flanking region of cnvrs were assessed. interestingly, it was observed that the g/c contents of cnvrs and  <dig> kb flanking region of cnvrs are on average  <dig> % and 1% lower than in the rest of the genome, respectively .

functional analysis of copy number polymorphic genes
genes overlapping with cnvrs were extracted and potential functional roles associated with cnvrs were identified by analyzing them. although partial duplication of a gene can lead to a functional new gene, the likelihood that a gene is functional intuitively decreases with the fraction of a gene that is duplicated. to limit the false discovery rate caused by the inclusion of a large fraction of non-functional gene duplicates, we only considered genes which are at least 70% overlapping with a cnvr. out of  <dig>  genes annotated in the current genome build ,  <dig> protein-coding genes were found to overlap with the  <dig> cnvrs  . a potential source of false positive calls are local high copy segments residing outside the gene exons resulting in cnvr calls without corresponding gene copy number variation. to avoid this type of false positives, the average depth of exon regions of the  <dig> genes, overlapping with a cnvr, were calculated . only genes with cn > <dig> in at least one individual and s.d. of ≥ <dig>  between  <dig> individuals were considered for further analysis. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes fulfilled this threshold . of the  <dig>  one to one orthologous genes between human, cow and pig, only  <dig> were observed as multi copy genes including  <dig> olfactory receptor genes and genes like kit, bfar, ahnak and flg <dig> . some of these genes only showed multiple copies in some of the individuals for example, kit , whereas others showed high cn in all individuals like flg <dig> with cn ranging between 10– <dig> 

the olfactory receptor gene family, one of the largest gene families in the porcine genome  <cit> , is over-represented with  <dig> out of  <dig> genes overlapping with cnvrs . genes involved in immune response, for instance ifn , ifnw <dig>  igk , il1b and pg3i, were often observed as variable in cn between individuals. defense related genes npg <dig> and pmap <dig>  which are specific to porcine genome, were found to be variable in cn. in addition, genes involved in metabolism, amy1a, amy <dig>  amy2a, amy2b and baat, and detoxification, abcg <dig>  ugt2b <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  cypa <dig>  cypa <dig>  cyp4f <dig> and cyp4x <dig>  are also present in the list of copy number variable genes.

few cn variable genes were observed to be unique to a specific group of pigs; asian domestics, asian wild boars, european wild boars or european domestic. one example is the genomic region at chromosome  <dig>  which contains the ugt2b <dig> gene  and was found to have a high cn specifically in asian domestics and asian wild boars . similarly, btn1a <dig>  cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  f <dig>  flg <dig>  mgat4c, ralgds and susd <dig> show variation in cn in all individuals but have comparatively high cn in the asian domestic individuals.

human orthologs of the porcine genes were used to analyze the functional enrichment of genes affected by cnvrs. gene ontology  enrichment analysis revealed that most of these genes were involved in biological processes regulating sensory perception of smell , signal transduction , neurological process  and metabolic process  .

cnvrs between groups
the inclusion of pigs from the two independent domestications together with animals representing their wild ancestors enables preliminary investigation into whether the pattern of cnvrs was influenced by the process of domestication and/or the demographic history of pigs. for this particular comparison, to avoid any bias caused by sampling size, we included only  <dig> individuals,  <dig> from each of the  <dig> different groups based on their geographical origin/population  . we compared the extent of overlap between the different groups and combination of the four groups and for each comparison, cnvrs were calculated separately  .

in all comparisons it is evident that the large majority of cnvrs are shared among the different groups . the asian group  was found to have a higher cnvrs count  than the european group . among the four groups, the asian domestic group was found to have the largest number of cnvrs  with a ratio of  <dig>  between shared and asian domestic group specific cnvrs. the european domestic group was found to have the lowest number of cnvrs  with a ratio of  <dig>  between the shared and european domestic group specific cnvrs . applying the same criterion as described above in the functional analyses, we extracted the genes overlapping with the cnvrs found in the comparative analyses. for each of the four groups we calculated the average cumulative count of genes and the s.d. of these overlapping genes . it is notable that the number of genes situated in cnvrs seems to be higher in domesticated animals, both european and asian, as compared to wild animals, but that the variation is lower in domesticated pigs compared to wild boars.

discussion
pigs have been important in agriculture and welfare for thousands of years. the recent completion of a high-quality draft genome of sus scrofa <cit>  enables the detailed investigation of a variety of genomics features. in this study, we used next generation sequence of  <dig> different wild as well as domestic pigs from eurasia to generate a detailed map of cnvrs in the porcine genome.

cnvrs in pig genomes 
we applied the read depth methodology  <cit>  to estimate cnvrs. in total  <dig>  cnvrs with an average size of  <dig> kb were identified. our result suggests that at least  <dig> %  of the porcine genome can vary in cn of a size larger than  <dig> kb, which is the minimum size we considered in this study. this figure is consistent with a recent study in cattle  <cit> . it is likely that the actual count and size of variable regions in the porcine genome is higher than our estimate. the stringent filtering criteria applied in our study, including a relatively high threshold of standard deviation to call a cnvr and exclusion of cn losses which were difficult to score with the sequence coverage currently available for the sampled individuals, likely inflated our false negetive discovery rate. in addition, 100% validiation of cnvrs tested by qpcr strengthens our confidence that our set of cnvrs is an underestimation rather than an overestimation.

nevertheless, we estimated significantly more cnvrs than previously reported in pigs. recently, two studies using array cgh inferred  <dig> cnvrs using  <dig> animals  <cit>  and  <dig> cnvrs on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in a set of  <dig> samples. in addition, three other studies using the porcine snp <dig> genotypes inferred  <dig> cnvrs using  <dig> animals  <cit> ,  <dig> cnvrs using  <dig> animals  <cit>  and  <dig> cnvrs using  <dig> pigs  <cit> . the limitations faced by these studies, may be related to different factors such as, homogeneous sampling , low marker density, non-uniform distribution of snps along pig chromosomes and/or a lack of specially designed non-polymorphic probes which is necessary to identify cnvr with higher resolution  <cit> . here, the rd method based on next-generation sequencing, using  <dig> different wild as well as domestic pigs from eurasia, resulted in a better resolution and higher confidence to call cnvrs. thus, most of the cnvrs discovered in this study are novel relative to the previous studies and represents the largest catalog of porcine specific cnvrs to date.

association of cnvrs with genomic features
previous studies suggested that repetitive elements play an important role in the formation of cnvrs and sds  <cit> . frequent breakage of dna in and around the repeat regions could initiate non-allelic homologous recombination  and result in cnvrs  <cit> . the enrichment of the repetitive elements line-l <dig>  ltr-erv <dig> and satellite elements at the boundaries of cnvrs and sds in the porcine genome , suggests that these families of repeat elements indeed facilitate the formation of cnvrs and sds in the porcine genome. this is in accordance with the observation made by giuffra et al. , who has reported an association of line-l <dig> and the duplication of the region containing the kit gene in the porcine genome  <cit> . similarly, the slightly lower g/c content  of cnvrs in the porcine genome suggests that the porcine cnvrs are likely to coincide with the gene-poor regions, which is consistent to the observation made in the human genome  <cit> .

copy number polymorphic genes
in total, we found  <dig> genes overlapping with cnvrs representing a valuable resource for future studies on the relation between cnv genes and phenotype variation. functional enrichment analysis suggests that genes involved in sensory perception of smell, signal transduction, neurological system process and metabolism are affected by the cnvrs. the enrichment of cnvrs involved in the sensory related genes is consistent to the general behavior of pigs, showing strong reliance on their sense of smell in various behavioral contexts. collectively, this data might assist future studies on some of the genetic variation influencing morphological, behavioral and physiological traits in pigs.

genes involved in immune response such as interferon , cytochrome p <dig> , are usually fast evolving due to their importance for the organism to respond rapid changes in the environment. our results show that these type of genes are often found to be cn variable in pigs. for example, members of interferon  gene families, involved in defense against viral infections, and cyp genes, which are responsible for detoxification and drug metabolism, were found to be cn variable. olfactory receptor  represents another gene family that is over-represented in our list of cn variable genes. sus scrofa have the largest repertoire of functional or genes in mammals   <cit> , likely related to the strong dependence on their sense of smell for foraging  <cit> . nearly one-third of the  <dig> porcine or genes are found as copy number variable in pigs. these findings suggest that the wide variety of environment faced by pigs around the world resulted in cnvs.

among defense related copy number variable genes, npg <dig>  and pmap <dig>  are cathelicidin related porcine specific genes. npg <dig> is responsible for microbicidal activity against escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and candida albicans in vitro <cit>  whereas pmap <dig> exerts antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro <cit> . in addition, camp , another cathelicidin related gene present in the list of copy number variable genes. the observed variation in copy number of cathelicidin related genes suggests an ongoing process of evolution of this gene-family in porcine genome to combat food-borne pathogens.

in humans, copy number of amylase genes, especially amy <dig>  shows high variation between populations . high copy number of amy <dig> allows more efficient breakdown of starch  <cit> . unlike in humans, pigs have a universally high number of copies  of amylases  between all individuals, suggesting universal importance of amylases for digesting starch-rich food in this omnivorous species.

genes such as btn1a <dig> and f <dig> are found to be involved in the regulation of milk lipid droplets  <cit>  and preterm delivery in human  <cit> , respectively. interestingly we found that these genes had variable numbers of copies in different pig breeds. specifically, asian breeds have typically a higher number of copies of these genes. in the pig breeding industry, asian breeds are famous for being highly prolific; with some breeds typically bearing more than  <dig> live young per litter. these results suggest that these genes have been important in the selection process for highly fertile breeds in asia. it is notable that some of these fertility genes have high cn in some european breeds . recent studies shown that this particular breed has been extensively admixed with chinese pigs in order to improve fertility traits during the industrial revolution  <cit> . thus, this pattern could also be the result of this well-known admixture.

some members of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferases  superfamily are found variable in copy number. ugts are part of important metabolic pathways responsible for the detoxification and elimination of many different endobiotics and xenobiotics  <cit> . the ugt2b <dig> gene, which is one of the most important genes involved in n-glucuronidation of nicotine, has a higher copy number in asian individuals  than the european individuals . the elevated copy number may be related to the ability to detoxifying specific plant secondary metabolites. although, at present there is no data on wild boar feeding habits in relation to floristic differences between east and west eurasia, our finding can direct future ecological studies on that subject.

demography shape cnvr diversity
regardless of their geographic origin, different pig populations have undergone different selective pressure. important events were the foundation of modern pig breeds starting around 200 years ago during the industrial revolution, and more recently, the development of modern breeding practices in the past five decade in different parts of asia and europe.

the association of cnvrs with distinct phenotypic effect and different selective regimes in europe and asia, suggest that differences in structural variation between wild and domestic pigs as well as asian and european populations, could reflect domestication history. by including different pigs from the two independent domestications together with individuals representative of their wild ancestors, enabled a first preliminary insight into the change in pattern of cnvrs influenced by the process of domestication and/or the natural demographic history of pigs.

to investigate the importance that cnvrs may have had on phenotypic diversification in breeds, we compared the amount of cnvrs in domesticated and wild individuals. we found more cnvrs in domesticated animals  than in wild boars . moreover, our results showed that cnvr counts were also higher in asian pigs   than in european pigs   , which is consistent with a large effective population size and diverse origin of asian pigs  <cit> .

a recent study based on snps identified a similar pattern not only between breeds and wild but also between asian and european pigs  <cit> . thus, cn seems to be more variable in larger populations, following the similar patterns as other types of variation such as snps  <cit>  and microsatellites  <cit> . this indicates that the general pattern of cnv is more reflecting demography rather than phenotypic diversity. having large fractions of common cnvrs between different groups and excess of cnvrs  in non-genic regions suggest that a major part of these variations are likely to be neutral or nearly neutral. this further supports their reflection on demography rather than phenotypic diversity. these results are of importance as they show that intensive artificial selection did not affect the overall diversity of cnvrs in domestic pigs and do not appear to be the major source of the large phenotypic diversity observed in domestic pigs.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig>  cnvrs with an average size of  <dig> kb comprising  <dig>  mb of the porcine genome, which represents the largest source of genetic variation identified in the porcine genome to date. the inferred cnv regions include  <dig> genes providing an important resource for future analyses on phenotypic variation in pigs. functional analyses revealed cnvrs enriched for genes related to sensory perception, neurological process, and response to stimulus in specific breeds or wild population. comparison between wild and domestic groups shows that, beside few exceptions, domestication did not lead to a change in cnvrs among breeds. moreover, we found that most cnvrs ascertained in domestics were also variable in wild boars. this result suggests that the majority of cnvrs were already segregating among wild boars before domestication. furthermore, while we identify few cnvrs that may be under selection during domestication and may lead to phenotypic differences, the majority of variable regions were found to reflect demographic pattern rather than selective regimes. our study represent a comprehensive analysis of cnv in both domestic and wild pigs and provides valuable insight in the evolutionary dynamics of copy number variation, in the context of adaptation and domestication.
