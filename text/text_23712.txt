BACKGROUND
formylglycine  is a cotranslational modification of cysteine that can be used as a bioorthogonal chemical handle for site-specific protein conjugation  <cit> . fgly is installed on a protein in the endoplasmic reticulum  through the action of formylglycine-generating enzyme . fge binds to its consensus sequence, cxpxr, where x represents any amino acid except proline, and catalyzes the oxidation of the cys thiol to an fgly aldehyde . the endogenous substrates for fge are sulfatase enzymes that use the fgly residue in their catalytic cycle. however, fge can also recognize non-native substrate proteins bearing the fge consensus sequence  <cit> . this substrate flexibility has been exploited by protein engineers in order to site-specifically modify proteins with a bioorthogonal chemical handle. using standard molecular biology techniques, the fge consensus sequence—or “aldehyde tag”—can be inserted at a desired location within a protein of interest. coexpression of fge with the aldehyde-tagged protein leads to fgly-containing proteins . although proving to be a useful tool , the yield of cys to fgly conversion on these recombinant proteins has been inconsistent. for example, when aldehyde-tagged fc proteins were expressed in cho cells—which express low levels of hamster fge—in the absence of exogenous fge overexpression, the proportion of fgly to cys in the final product was 28–67 %  <cit> . the reported fgly yield improved somewhat when fge was overexpressed in the cells via transient  or stable  transfection  <cit> .fig.  <dig> formylglycine-generating enzyme  converts the cys found within in its consensus sequence to an fgly residue. the fge consensus sequence, cxpxr, where x is any residue except proline, is genetically encoded into a desired location within the target protein of interest, e.g., an antibody. vectors encoding this “aldehyde-tagged” protein and the fge enzyme are introduced into a cell; then, during protein production fge cotranslationally modifies the cys within the cxpxr sequence, removing the thiol group and replacing it with an aldehyde, resulting in an overall conversion from a cys to a formylglycine  residue. the aldehyde group within the fgly serves as a chemical handle that can be used for downstream site-specific bioconjugation

fig.  <dig> fgly conversion is affected by cell culture media and time in culture. a cho-s clone  stably expressing fge + kdel and ct-tagged antibody was cultured in pf-cho™ or forticho™, fed with 10 % efficient feed c on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and supplemented with 3 g/l glucose when levels dropped below 3 g/l. samples of media were taken at the indicated days . titers  were assessed by elisa, and conversion was determined by mass spectrometry. representative data are shown 



we use the aldehyde tag in combination with proprietary aldehyde-reactive chemistries as a site-specific conjugation platform called smartag™. our technology aims to enable the large-scale production and commercialization of aldehyde-tagged  proteins, such as antibody-drug conjugates  <cit> . to this end, we sought to reduce the variability in fgly yield and push the protein yields as high as possible in order to achieve maximum production efficiency. we recently determined that the catalytic mechanism employed by fge requires a copper cofactor  <cit> . with that in mind, we explored supplementing cell cultures with copper, and found that addition of 50 μm copper sulfate to the culture media was sufficient to significantly increase fgly yields, even under manufacturing conditions using fed-batch cell cultures with antibody titers of 5 g · l− <dig> and in a 100 l bioreactor run reaching  <dig>  g · l− <dig> 

RESULTS
intracellular fge levels do not correlate with cys to fgly conversion
as a first step to address the variability of fgly conversion levels, we considered that differences in intracellular fge levels might affect conversion yields. wild-type human fge is partially retained in the er through interactions of its n-terminal region  with endoplasmic reticulum resident protein  <dig>   <cit> . this interaction can be abrogated by furin-mediated proteolytic cleavage at an internal site, allowing the remaining catalytically-active core enzyme to be secreted  <cit> . with this in mind, we took two approaches towards retaining fge inside the cell. one was to delete the furin cleavage site, leaving fge intact and able to retain its interactions with erp <dig>  the other was to incorporate an alternative er-retention signal—a kdel sequence—at fge’s c-terminus. in some iterations, both modifications were included in the same construct.

plasmids encoding these various forms of fge, including wild-type, furin site-deleted , +kdel, and dfur + kdel, were used to make cho-s clonal cell lines stably expressing the fge isoforms under the control of the human ef1α promoter. then, from these lines we selected fge clones with varying levels of intracellular fge as determined by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay -based experiments . next, we tested the efficiency of conversion on transiently-expressed antibodies in these clones. furthermore, we also generated stable pools of antibody-expressing cells by transfecting these fge clones. together, the transient transfections and stable pools covered two antibody backbones and two aldehyde tags placed at different locations—at the c-terminus of the heavy chain  and in the hinge region. although the antibody titers from these cultures were low, conversion analyses demonstrated that there was no correlation between conversion efficiency and intracellular fge levels, or forms of fge, under these conditions .table  <dig> fge form does not correlate with conversion yield

fgly conversion is affected by cell culture media and time in culture
from this work, we selected a stable cho-s clone expressing fge + kdel and ct-tagged antibody  <dig>  to test the effect of media on fgly yield. as a starting point, we cultured the cells in either cd forticho™ or pf-cho™ ls, and measured titer, viability, cell density, and conversion to fgly. we observed that the media had a pronounced effect on the fgly yield . cells cultured in pf-cho™ ls yielded highly converted antibody throughout the production run with 98 % fgly at day  <dig> and 86 % fgly at day  <dig>  by contrast, cells cultured in cd forticho™ produced antibody that contained a decreasing amount of fgly as time in culture proceeded. while antibody from this culture contained 70 % fgly at day  <dig>  by day  <dig> the proportion of fgly had dropped to 20 %. meanwhile, the viability of the cells over time was similar under both conditions, but the titers were approximately two-fold higher in the pf-cho™ ls media, and cell density was two- to three-fold higher in the cd forticho™ media .table  <dig> conversion to fgly is highly dependent on cell culture conditions



addition of copper sulfate to cell culture media increases conversion yields
the dependence of fgly yields on cell culture conditions suggested that a media component might be limiting. we recently determined that the catalytic mechanism employed by fge requires a copper cofactor  <cit> . therefore, the cells require a stoichiometric amount of copper to match fge enzyme levels in order to ensure fge activity. the disparity observed in the conversion levels of antibodies produced in pf-cho™ ls and cd forticho™ media could reflect differing amounts of copper contained in those proprietary media . furthermore, the decreasing conversion yields observed over time in culture—most strongly exemplified in the cd forticho™ cultures—may reflect depletion of copper in the media through cell growth and metabolism. in order to test this theory, we cultured clone  <dig> in cd forticho™ media +/- supplementation with  <dig>   <dig>  or 50 μm copper sulfate added on day  <dig>  media was harvested on day  <dig> and antibodies were analyzed for conversion . the results showed that addition of 5 μm or more copper sulfate led to fgly yields of ≥ 96 % as compared to a 77 % yield in cells that were not supplemented with copper.fig.  <dig> fgly conversion proceeds efficiently in cells cultured in the presence of 5–50 μm copper sulfate. cho-s clone  <dig> stably expressing fge + kdel and ct-tagged antibody was cultured in forticho™ +/- the indicated concentrations of copper sulfate added on day  <dig> , or with 50 μm copper sulfate added on days  <dig> or  <dig> . cultures were fed with 10 % efficient feed c on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  media was harvested at day  <dig>  or day  <dig> ; titers  were assessed by elisa, and conversion was determined by mass spectrometry. n =  <dig> experiments for  <dig> and 50 μm copper sulfate added on day 0; other time points and copper sulfate concentrations were tested once



in order to test the dependence of timing on this effect, we cultured clone  <dig> in cd forticho™ media +/- supplementation with 50 μm copper sulfate added on day  <dig> or day  <dig>  media was harvested on day  <dig> and antibodies were analyzed for conversion . the results showed that addition of copper at either time point gave similar results as addition at day 0; namely, fgly yields ≥ 95 % as compared to a 58 % yield in cells that were not supplemented with copper.

in order to test the specificity of the observed copper effect on fgly yields, we tried substituting various other metal ions that are common enzyme cofactors, including iron sulfate, magnesium chloride, and zinc chloride . none of these metals improved the fgly yield over media alone. this result was consistent with our observations of purified fge, which showed that only copper, but not these other cofactors, could increase the enzyme’s specific activity  <cit> .

addition of copper sulfate to cell culture media results in fge copper loading and holoenzyme formation
transport and delivery of copper is a tightly regulated process in eukaryotes  <cit> . by one estimate, there is no unbound  intracellular copper  <cit> . therefore, the addition of copper to culture media did not guarantee that it would be incorporated into the fge enzyme. to test this, we prepared a variant of human fge containing a his <dig> affinity tag . transient cotransfection of vectors containing h6-hs-fge and the ct-tagged antibody was performed in expi293™ cells +/- supplementation of  <dig> μm copper sulfate in the cell culture media. after 4 days in culture, the cells were washed to remove excess media , lysed, and h6-hs-fge was purified from the cell lysate using metal affinity chromatography . after purification, h6-hs-fge was assayed for copper content and specific activity . inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  analysis of the purified enzymes demonstrated that the enzyme purified from copper-treated cells contained more copper  as compared to the enzyme purified from untreated cells . accordingly, we found that the fge isolated from cells grown in copper-containing media was significantly more active  than that isolated from untreated cells . finally, we measured the fgly content in the purified antibody, which also correlated with the presence  or absence  of the copper supplement . together, these data demonstrated that addition of copper sulfate to the cell culture media was sufficient to provide fge with the required copper cofactor, which then allowed the enzyme to efficiently convert cys to fgly during protein production. interestingly, this copper loading does not occur efficiently when fge is produced in e. coli  <cit> . copper supplementation of bacterial cultures does result in a modest improvement in holoenzyme formation , but to a much lesser extent than that observed in mammalian cells. insect cells cultures are also efficient at holoenyzme formation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> fge purified from copper sulfate-supplemented cells contains copper and has enhanced specific activity. a gene encoding fge containing a his <dig> affinity tag was cotransfected with ct-tagged antibody into expi293™ cells. cells were cultured +/- supplementation with 50 μm copper sulfate. on day  <dig>  antibody was harvested. then, the cells were washed to remove excess media , lysed, and h6-hs-fge was purified from the cell lysate using metal affinity chromatography. purified fge was analyzed by reducing and non-reducing sds-page . then, the purified h6-hs-fge samples were assayed for copper content—by icp-ms —and for specific activity—via an hplc-based assay on a peptide substrate . conversion of the antibody was determined by mass spectrometry . the experiment was repeated four times with similar results; error bars in c represent standard deviation . icp-ms copper analysis  and conversion analysis of the cotransfected antibody were performed once



high conversion and titers are observed in transiently transfected cultures supplemented with copper sulfate
because the previous experiments were conducted using stable fge clones, next we tested whether conversion could proceed efficiently in a fully-transient expression system . for this purpose, we used expi293f™ cells cotransfected with three vectors, one each encoding fge, the antibody light chain, and the antibody heavy chain. furthermore, we asked whether fge could convert aldehyde tags installed at any of several locations on the same antibody, or at the same location on multiple human igg <dig> antibodies. with respect to tag placement, we tested three variants of an antibody with the aldehyde tag installed in either the ch <dig>  the hinge, or at the ct. the transient titers of these antibodies ranged from  <dig> to 578 mg/l , and the conversion of cys to fgly was consistently high . with respect to antibodies with different variable regions, the installation of the aldehyde tag at the same site  across three different igg <dig> antibodies resulted in similar titers and high conversion .fig.  <dig> aldehyde tag conversion is independent of tag location and antibody type. the aldehyde tag was incorporated at various positions across an antibody heavy chain—at the ch <dig>  hinge, or heavy chain c-terminus . cotransfection of vectors encoding fge and the relevant heavy and lights chains in expi293™ cells enabled transient production of fgly-containing antibodies in good titer  and with high conversion . by comparison, when untagged antibody was expressed following the same procedure, the titer was 223 mg/l. installation of the aldehyde tag at the ch-ct of three different igg1-type antibodies followed by coexpression with fge in expi293™ cells resulted in the same high titers  and conversion . all panels, n = 3; error bars represent standard deviation



gpex® system-derived clones stably expressing both fge and aldehyde-tagged antibody yield high titers and high conversion
bolstered by these positive results in transient cultures, we next tested stable cell lines that could eventually be expanded into a manufacturing process. a retrovector transduction  of cho cells was performed to incorporate human fge into cellular dna, generating stable pools from which clones were selected. stable expression of human fge in the clones was confirmed by flow cytometry. then, the fge clones were transduced to generate stable pools of antibody expressing cells. these cells were tested for antibody titer and fgly conversion during culture in three common media types, for which the copper content is not disclosed: pf-cho™ ls, cd opticho™, and hycell™ . without copper sulfate supplementation, we observed good titers, but variable conversion yields in antibodies produced in these media. by contrast, addition of copper to the cultures led to consistently high fgly content without decreasing titers. in the case of pf-cho™ ls, the yield of fgly in the purified antibody increased from 74 ± 4 %  to 94 ± 2 % .fig.  <dig> high fgly conversion yields can be obtained from stably transduced cell lines under high titer cell culture conditions. stable transduction of dna encoding fge, antibody light chain, and antibody heavy chain bearing one  or two  aldehyde tags was performed with viral retrovector transduction into cho cells . the resulting stable pools were cultured in three types of media +/- supplementation with copper sulfate . titers  and fgly conversion  of ct-tagged antibodies were assessed. then, the stable pools were cloned by limiting dilution and clone performance was assessed in fed batch cultures . the top performing stable single-tagged clonal cell line produced antibody in very high titer  with 98 % conversion of cys to fgly . the specific productivity  of this top clone demonstrates the capabilities of the gpex® technology for efficient production of highly converted antibody. the generation of fgly in single- and doubly-tagged antibodies scaled successfully to bioreactors . error bars indicate standard deviation



subcloning of these stable pools by limiting dilution afforded cell lines that produced high amounts of protein  in fed batch shake flask cultures . more importantly, the conversion yield remained extremely high  even with the increased titers and productivity . we also generated clonal cell lines producing antibody containing two aldehyde tag sites per heavy chain , resulting in four fgly sites per antibody. doubling the number of sites was well-tolerated by the fge-producing cell lines. for the top performing doubly-tagged clones, the yields of fgly were  <dig>  % ±  <dig>  in the ch <dig> and  <dig>  % ±  <dig>  at the ct ; the antibody titers were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l . the clonal cell line productions of singly- and doubly-tagged antbodies were successfully scaled to 2 l bioreactors . the highest antibody-producing clone, with a titer of  <dig>  g/l, had a specific productivity  of 75 pg/cell/d. to confirm that these cell lines and processes are scalable for development of clinical and commercial products, a 100 l production run was performed. as expected the results were similar to the 2 l production with titers reaching  <dig>  g/l, specific productivity of 43 pg/cell/d, and fgly conversion yields of  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> a gpex® clonal cell line expressing ct-tagged antibody afforded high fgly conversion and high titers in a 100 l bioreactor production run. cells were cultured in hycell™ media supplemented with 50 μm copper sulfate. the protein concentration and integral of viable cell density is shown. cultures were terminated when viabilities were ≤ 80 %. titers of  <dig>  g/l were reached. the cells demonstrated a specific productivity of 43 pg/cell/d, and the resulting antibody had fgly conversion yields of  <dig>  %



CONCLUSIONS
the incorporation of fgly has been leveraged for the transport and display of a wide range of payloads, including dna for protein scaffolding  <cit> ; chromophores for probing protein dynamics  <cit> ; anchors for solid substrates  <cit> ; immobilization of viruses  <cit>  and enzymes  <cit> ; and the site-specific attachment of cytotoxic drugs for the generation of antibody–drug conjugates . with site-specific conjugation, it is now possible to build structure activity relationships for adcs that correlate payload placement on the antibody with efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and conjugate stability  <cit> .

in an effort to scale up production of fgly-containing antibody for preclinical evaluation of next-generation adcs, we designed a method to generate a high yield of this modification during antibody production. our results highlight the robust generation of fgly by fge in vivo. the enzyme is able to maintain a rate of turnover that matches antibody production for the duration of cell culture as long as it has access to sufficient amounts of copper. perhaps most importantly, the addition of  <dig> μm copper sulfate to the media has no obvious deleterious effects on cell growth, cell density, protein titer, or culture duration. however, considering what is known about the impact of copper on antibody quality, including the production of basic variants  <cit> , we plan to continue to refine the copper requirements during antibody production. as a first step towards establishing reproducible conversion in the context of a high titer antibody production, the simple solution outlined herein enables the generation of antibodies containing aldehyde tags in a process that is compatible with industrial scale production.
