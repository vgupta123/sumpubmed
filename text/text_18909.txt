BACKGROUND
human adenoviruses are double-stranded  dna viruses that represent a major risk for immunocompromised patients  <cit> , and severe manifestations of adenoviral infections can be life-threatening. mortality rates as high as 80% have been reported in cases of disseminated disease  <cit> . the incidence of disseminated disease is highest among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, and adenoviruses belonging to species b and c are the main cause of severe adenovirus infections  <cit> .

cidofovir  is the most commonly used agent for the treatment of adenovirus infections. although the drug demonstrates clinical efficacy, its activity is not sufficient to prevent fatal outcomes in all instances  <cit> , and derivatives of cdv are still being evaluated. thus, alternative strategies to treat severe adenovirus infections have been developed. donor lymphocyte infusion therapy, and particularly the adoptive transfer of adenovirus-specific t cells represents a promising approach for the treatment of immunocompromised patients  <cit> , but its efficacy is still under investigation.

we and others recently investigated the potential of rna interference -mediated silencing of adenoviral gene expression in the control of the multiplication of adenoviruses in vitro <cit> . rnai-based approaches to silence viral and non-viral genes employ either the transduction of cells with short interfering rnas  or the intracellular generation of short hairpin rnas  and precursors of artificial mirnas , respectively, from dna sequences introduced into those cells  <cit> . in contrast to exogenously added sirnas, shrnas and precursor amirnas must undergo intracellular processing through the rnai pathway prior to recognizing their respective target mrnas and eventually mediating their destruction or causing translational repression. by employing sirnas directed against a set of adenoviral transcripts required for very different viral processes, genes essential for adenoviral dna synthesis  and the viral dna polymerase) emerged as promising targets for the inhibition of virus multiplication  <cit> . furthermore, in a modification of the approach, an amirna directed against the ptp mrna was introduced into wild-type  adenovirus-infected cells via adenoviral vectors  <cit> . in both approaches, the output of infectious virus progeny from infected cells could be decreased by several orders of magnitude, indicating that rnai-based methods can, in principle, be employed to control adenovirus replication.

in a very distinct approach, we rendered adenovirus susceptible to treatment with the antiherpetic compound, ganciclovir , through the targeted expression of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase  gene in wt ad5-infected cells  <cit> . gcv is a prodrug that requires phosphorylation by herpes viruses-encoded thymidine kinases to be efficiently converted into its active form  <cit> . once activated , gcv functions as a nucleoside analog, blocking both cellular and viral dna synthesis by competing with dgtp for incorporation into nascent dna strands  <cit> . the first phosphorylation step, which is efficiently carried out only by thymidine kinases encoded by herpes viruses , explains the selectivity of gcv for herpes virus-infected cells  <cit> . targeted expression of hsv-tk in wt ad5-infected cells was accomplished by inserting the hsv-tk open reading frame downstream of the ad <dig> e <dig> promoter, whose activity is strongly increased in the presence of the ad <dig> e1a gene products   <cit> . introducing the hsv-tk expression cassette into wt ad5-infected cells via a replication-deficient adenoviral vector lacking the e1a region strongly inhibited wt ad <dig> dna replication upon treatment of the cells with low concentrations of gcv, while no obvious effects on viability were observed in cells not infected with wt ad <dig> 

in the study presented here, we integrated the  <dig> approaches by generating adenoviral vectors that express both the hsv-tk gene from the adenoviral e <dig> promoter and, from a distinct expression unit, multiple copies of an amirna directed against the wt ad <dig> ptp mrna. we present data indicating that, upon treatment with gcv, the simultaneous expression of both cassettes in wt ad5-infected cells results in additive anti-adenoviral effects in vitro. moreover, we demonstrate that the additional expression of amirnas directed against viral ptp transcripts allows for lower levels of gcv treatment without a loss of antiadenoviral activity. finally, we discuss how this combinatorial gene expression cassette may be used as a safeguard to potentially control unintended replication of adenoviral vectors and to prevent immune responses provoked by them.

methods
cell culture, virus amplification, and titer determination
hek  <dig> , a <dig> , and t-rex- <dig> cells  were cultivated in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  with stabilized glutamine  and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere at 37°c. recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing ad5-directed amirnas alone or in combination with the hsv-tk gene were amplified in t-rex- <dig> cells. titers of recombinant adenoviruses expressing amirnas were determined on t-rex- <dig> cells by 50% tissue culture infective dose  assays. titers of wt ad <dig> present in mixed virus suspensions containing both wt and recombinant virus as obtained in co-infection experiments were determined on a <dig> cells using the same method. all other tcid <dig> assays were performed with hek  <dig> cells. crude virus suspensions for titer determination were obtained by freeze-thawing the samples thrice and removing cell debris by centrifugation at 2800 rpm for 15 min.

vector construction
adenoviral vectors for the combinatorial expression of amirnas and hsv-tk were generated by first constructing plasmid vector versions thereof. these “entry” vectors are based on life technologie’s gateway system for recombination-mediated cloning. from these entry vectors, the expression cassettes were eventually transferred into the adenoviral vector backbones via site-specific recombination. all entry vectors for combinatorial amirna/hsv-tk expression are based on pee4_tk  <cit>  and carry the herpes simplex virus  <dig> thymidine kinase gene downstream of the ad <dig> e <dig> promoter. to generate the combinatorial vectors, the amirna expression cassettes were inserted into the xmni site located downstream of the hsv-tk expression unit. the amirna expression cassettes comprise a cmv promoter/enhancer followed by a 2xteto <dig> tetracyclin repressor binding site, and end with a bgh poly site. this fragment was obtained by pcr amplification from pcdna4/to  by using primers cmv-to-f <dig> and bghpa-r <dig> . the bcli site, located downstream of the promoter/operator region, was used for insertion of the egfp/amirna cassettes, which comprise an open reading frame for egfp and  <dig> or  <dig> copies of either the ptp-mi <dig> amirna or the universal, non-targeting amirna inserted into the egfp 3′utr. these cassettes were obtained by pcr amplification from vectors pcdna <dig> -gw/emgfp-mir-neg , pmirex <dig> , pmire-ptp-mi <dig> , and pmire-ptp-mi5x <dig>  using primers pmire-f <dig>  and pmire-r <dig> . in all amirna expression cassettes, the sequences giving rise to pre-amirna hairpins are flanked by sequences derived from the murine mmu-mir- <dig> pri-mirna. the final entry vectors were designated pto-tk-mi- and pto-tk-mi-× <dig> , and pto-tk-ptp-mi <dig> and pto-tk-ptp-mi5x <dig> .

eventually, the expression cassettes present in the entry vectors were cloned into the deleted e <dig> region of the adenoviral vector pad/pl-dest , giving rise to the combinatorial adenoviral vectors adto-tk-mi-, adto-tk-mi-× <dig>  adto-ptp-ptp-mi <dig>  and adto-ptp-ptp-mi5x <dig> . this final cloning step was mediated by life technologies’ gateway technology . the recombination reaction was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer . the construction of the adenoviral vectors adee <dig>  adee4-tk, ad-mi-, adto-mi-× <dig>  and adto-ptp-mi5x <dig> has been described  <cit> .

restriction enzymes and dna-modifying enzymes were purchased from fermentas  or new england biolabs . pcr was performed with pwo dna polymerase obtained from roche diagnostics  or peqlab .

nucleic acid extraction
for the extraction of circular plasmid dna, an easyprep pro plasmid miniprep kit  or a hispeed plasmid midi kit  was used. pcr products were purified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit , and adenoviral dna was isolated with a qiaamp dna blood mini kit .

virus replication experiments
for inhibition of adenovirus replication by sirna-mediated gene silencing and concomitant hsv-tk expression/gcv treatment, 3e +  <dig> a <dig> cells were seeded into the wells of a 96-well plate and transfected with  <dig> nm sirna specific for transcripts of the viral dna polymerase , preterminal protein , iva <dig> , hexon , or protease . a universal, non-targeting sirna  served as a negative control. the functionality of all sirnas was assessed previously  <cit> . at 24 h after transfection, the cells were transduced with the adenoviral vectors adee4-tk or adee <dig>  at an moi of  <dig> tcid50/cell. at 24 h after transduction, the cells were infected with ad <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  tcid50/cell and cultivated in the presence or absence of  <dig>  μm gcv for an additional 2 days before extraction of dna and determination of wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers.

inhibition of adenovirus replication by amirnas and/or hsv-tk expression/gcv treatment was assessed by seeding 3e +  <dig> a <dig> cells into the wells of 96-well plates, followed by transduction with the adenoviral vectors encoding hsv-tk and one or more amirna copies at an moi of  <dig> tcid50/cell. after 24 h, the cells were infected with wt ad <dig> at an moi of  <dig>  tcid50/cell and cultivated in the presence of gcv at concentrations ranging between  <dig> and  <dig>  μm for up to 6 days. the cultures were subjected either to dna isolation for determination of wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers or to tcid <dig> analysis.

the inhibitory effect of the hsv-tk/amirna expression cassette on the replication of vector adto-tk-ptp-mi5x <dig> was determined by transducing  <dig> e + 05 t-rex- <dig> cells with the vector at an moi of  <dig>  tcid50/cell. at the time of transduction, amirna expression was induced by adding 1 μg/ml doxycycline to the medium, and gcv was added at concentrations ranging between  <dig> and  <dig>  μm. at 48 h after transduction, the cultures were subjected to dna isolation and determination of vector copy numbers by qpcr.

determination of adenovirus genome copy numbers
determination of wt ad <dig> dna levels was performed by qpcr using a taqman primer/probe set specific for the e1a gene . for the determination of dna levels of recombinant adenoviral vectors, a taqman primer/probe set specific for the hexon gene was used . adenovirus genome copy numbers were determined using serial dilutions of an adenoviral reference dna as a standard.

facs analysis
egfp expression rates were determined by facs analysis. cells transduced with egfp-expressing adenoviruses were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in normal cell culture medium, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min. thereafter, cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline  and fixed with 1% formaldehyde in pbs. samples were analyzed with a facs calibur analyzer , and percentages of fluorescent cells and mean fluorescence intensities  were calculated.

statistical analysis
all the data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation . in cases in which the dataset consisted of only  <dig> groups of samples, student’s t-test was applied to test for statistical significance. for the analysis of larger datasets, one-way anova, corrected with bonferroni´s post-hoc test, was applied. a p-value less than  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
adenovirus-directed sirnas increase the hsv-tk/gcv-mediated anti-adenoviral effect
we have previously shown that sirnas or adenoviral vector-encoded amirnas targeting viral mrnas coding for essential viral dna synthesis components  can inhibit wt ad <dig> replication in vitro <cit> . we have also demonstrated that the targeted expression of hsv-tk in wt ad5-infected cells renders adenovirus amenable to inhibition by gcv, through the suppression of viral dna synthesis  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that a combination of the  <dig> approaches can lead to additive effects.

to obtain evidence for such additive effects, we transfected a <dig> cells with the panel of sirnas directed against the hexon, viral protease, iva <dig>  ptp, and viral dna polymerase mrnas selected in the previous study. subsequently, cells were transduced with the adenoviral hsv-tk expression vector, adee4-tk, or its respective negative control vector, padee <dig> carrying an egfp gene instead of the hsv-tk gene, and were treated with  <dig>  μm gcv. this concentration is in the range of patient serum levels after treatment with typical doses of gcv  <cit> , and has previously been shown by us to inhibit wt ad <dig> replication in cells expressing hsv-tk from adee4-tk, while leaving cells not infected with wt ad <dig> unaffected  <cit> . finally, cells were infected with wt ad <dig>  and 48 h after infection, wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers were determined. transfection of sirna alone inhibited wt ad <dig> replication to an extent comparable to that obtained in our previous study . as already demonstrated, sirnas targeting early transcripts  were much more efficient than those targeting late transcripts . the highest inhibition rates were obtained with the dna replication-targeting anti-ptp and anti-dna polymerase sirnas, with the latter leading to an inhibition rate of  <dig> orders of magnitude . alternatively, hsv-tk expression alone decreased wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers by  <dig>  orders of magnitude . however, wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers declined even further upon concomitant transfection of cells with the sirnas . again, the viral dna replication-affecting sirnas led to the most prominent additive effects. these effects were not only visible as decreased wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers, but also as a reduction in the output of infectious virus progeny .

combined hsv-tk and amirna expression increases the anti-adenoviral effect in the presence of gcv
these results prompted us to generate a combinatorial adenoviral vector harboring the hsv-tk expression unit, such as that present on adee4-tk, and an amirna expression cassette, as found in adto-ptp-mi <dig>  in our previous study  <cit> , an amirna  targeting the ad <dig> ptp mrna was identified as the most potent amirna for inhibition of wt ad <dig> dna replication in vitro. thus, in the present study, we merged the adenoviral hsv-tk expression vector, adee4-tk, with the adenoviral ptp-mi <dig> expression vector, adto-ptp-mi <dig>  to create the adenoviral vector adto-tk-ptp-mi <dig> . a corresponding negative control vector  carrying an expression cassette for a negative control amirna instead of ptp-mi <dig> was also constructed. we decided to use replication-deficient adenoviral vectors for the combined hsv-tk/amirna expression and delivery, because this type of vector may prove advantageous in an envisioned therapeutic application. because of the shared organ tropism of the adenoviral vector and the wt virus, such a vector may ensure the delivery of the expression cassettes into those cells that are also the preferred targets of the wt virus.

because efficient amplification of adenoviral vectors containing an adenoviral dna replication-targeting amirna cassette in packaging cells requires the shutdown of amirna expression in these cells, amirna expression in our system is under the control of a tetracycline repressor/operator system. when produced in packaging cells, the tetracycline repressor shuts down amirna expression. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the regulatable expression system is functional in both the plasmid and adenoviral vectors constructed in this study: the production of egfp, which can serve as a measure of amirna production because it is encoded by the same primary transcript that gives rise to the amirna , was strongly suppressed in packaging cells upon expression of the tetracycline repressor. to investigate whether the combinatorial vector leads to increased inhibition of wt ad <dig> replication, we transduced a <dig> cells with adto-tk-ptp-mi <dig> or the negative control vector, adto-tk-mi-, and infected them with wt ad <dig>  concomitantly, cells were or were not treated with  <dig>  μm gcv, and wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers were determined 48 h post-infection with wt ad <dig> . in the absence of gcv, ptp-mi <dig> expression inhibited wt ad <dig> replication by slightly more than  <dig> order of magnitude. hsv-tk expression in the presence of  <dig>  μm gcv but in the absence of the ptp-targeting amirna led to a decrease of wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers by  <dig>  orders of magnitude. however, a combination of ptp-mi <dig> and hsv-tk expression and concomitant treatment with gcv led to a further significant drop in wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers. neither the negative control amirna nor the expression of hsv-tk in the absence of gcv significantly inhibited wt ad <dig> replication . the additive effect of concomitant ptp-mi <dig> and hsv-tk expression became more prominent when we cultivated the wt ad5-infected cells for longer periods, and measured wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers at 6 days post-infection with wt ad <dig> . here, the additional gain in the inhibition rate was greater than one order of magnitude.

multicopy amirna/hsv-tk expression inhibits wt adenovirus replication even at very low gcv concentrations
to create the final version of the vector, we improved the amirna/hsv-tk expression cassette by incorporating additional copies of ptp-mi <dig> hairpins into the egfp/amirna transcription unit. this approach had previously resulted in increased knockdown of ptp gene expression  <cit>  and hence, it was anticipated to be beneficial for the function of the vectors generated in this study. the final vectors  were used to transduce a <dig> cells. concomitantly, the cells were treated with gcv and infected with wt ad <dig>  as performed previously. because hsv-tk expression and concomitant treatment with  <dig>  μm gcv alone had already been proven to efficiently inhibit wt ad <dig> replication, we assumed that additional expression of the 6xptp amirna cassette might allow for efficient inhibition of wt ad <dig> replication at even lower gcv concentrations. thus, we incubated the cells with increasing amounts of gcv  and determined wt ad <dig> genome copy numbers at 48 h post-infection . as expected, at the highest gcv concentration of  <dig>  μm, the additive effect of 6xptp-mi <dig> expression on wt ad <dig> inhibition was minor and, in the particular set of experiments shown here, not statistically significant . however, the gain in wt ad <dig> inhibition became clearly visible upon gradually lowering the gcv concentration . in fact, even at the lowest concentration of  <dig>  μm , the total inhibition rate  was comparable to that after treatment with the almost 10-fold higher gcv concentration of  <dig>  μm in figure 5d . in contrast, the inhibition rate gradually decreased upon lowering the gcv concentration in the presence of the non-targeting negative control amirna . in conclusion, simultaneous expression of the 6xptp-mi <dig> expression cassette allowed for a 10-fold decrease in the gcv concentration, without resulting in a significant loss in the inhibition rate. at any gcv concentration, the combinatorial inhibitory effect was also clearly higher than the effect that was mediated by the 6×ptp-mi <dig> expression cassette alone .

the additive effect mediated by the 6×ptp-mi <dig> expression unit also manifested as a further drop in the output of infectious virus progeny as determined by tcid <dig> analysis . again, this effect became most pronounced when gcv became limiting  .

the combinatorial hsv-tk/amirna expression cassette inhibits adenoviral vector replication
in the presence of gcv and in the absence of the tetracycline repressor, the combinatorial expression cassette comprising the egfp/amirna and hsv-tk transcription units should not only have a negative effect on the replication of a wt adenovirus present in the same cells, but also on the adenoviral vector itself by which it is carried. to investigate this inhibitory effect, we transduced t-rex  <dig> cells, which carry the adenoviral e <dig> genes and thus promote the replication of otherwise replication-deficient adenoviral vectors, with the combinatorial vector, adto-tk-ptp-mi5x <dig>  we cultivated the cells with or without doxycycline for an additional 48 h to determine the amirna-mediated inhibitory effect, and treated them with increasing amounts of gcv  to investigate the hsv-tk-mediated effect. gcv treatment alone, in the absence of ptp-mi <dig> expression , was only effective at the highest gcv concentration of  <dig>  μm . here, the amount of vector dna was decreased by ~ <dig>  orders of magnitude. no significant inhibition was seen at lower concentrations of gcv, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm. the expression of the ptp-mi <dig> amirna alone  decreased vector copy numbers by about one order of magnitude. the expression of ptp-mi <dig> in addition to gcv treatment led to a clear increase in the overall inhibitory effect when low concentrations of gcv were used . thus, in agreement with the previous results , the combinatorial amirna/hsv-tk expression cassette was of the highest benefit when gcv was limiting. leaky expression from adenoviral promoters is an issue in the application of adenoviral vectors as gene delivery vehicles, and recombination with wt adenovirus may transform replication-deficient, e1- and e3-deleted adenoviral vectors into replication-competent versions. thus, taken together, the combinatorial hsv-tk/amirna expression cassette presented here may constitute a tool for the decrease of adenoviral background gene expression and aid in the control of unintended vector replication, or, when present in cells that become infected with wt adenovirus, may inhibit wt adenovirus replication and spreading.

discussion
we previously demonstrated the inhibition of adenovirus replication both by rnai-based methods and through the targeted expression of hsv-tk in adenovirus-infected cells with concomitant gcv treatment. both approaches targeted viral dna replication, albeit in different ways. while the sirnas/amirnas decreased the number of functional viral proteins that are needed for the initiation  or progression of viral dna replication , gcv-ppp acted downstream of these steps in a functionally different way . cdv is mechanistically related to gcv-ppp since it blocks the same step during virus replication  <cit> , and we have demonstrated that the expression of a ptp rna-targeting amirna in adenovirus-infected cells and concomitant treatment with cdv leads to additive inhibitory effects  <cit> . thus, it was conceivable that a combination of ptp gene silencing via an amirna and hsv-tk expression/gcv treatment can result in a similar effect. this assumption was supported by results demonstrating that sirnas targeting viral transcripts required for dna replication increased the hsv-tk/gcv-mediated effect . in these experiments, we did not only include the sirnas with the highest previously proven inhibitory effect on adenoviral dna replication, but also the ones that had resulted in poor antiviral effects in our previous study . we hypothesized that a strong inhibition of viral dna replication by hsv-tk expression/gcv treatment  should decrease viral dna genome copy numbers and, consequently, hexon and protease gene copy numbers. this, in turn, should result in a decrease in the otherwise vast amounts of hexon and protease transcripts present in adenovirus-infected cells, which may allow the sirnas to silence their respective target genes more effectively. however, similar to our previous study, the hexon and protease rna-targeting sirnas were relatively poor inhibitors of virus multiplication under these conditions. these results reflect those obtained in experiments in which we inhibited viral dna synthesis by sirnas, but were unable to further increase the overall antiviral effect by also targeting the hexon and protease transcripts  <cit> . thus, the data presented here support our previous observations that argue against a concomitant targeting of different viral processes  as the method of choice to inhibit adenovirus multiplication but, rather, for the targeting of only a single process such as viral dna synthesis at different steps.

thus, it was conclusive to incorporate the individual modules for hsv-tk and ptp-mi <dig> expression into one common vector to concomitantly target adenoviral dna synthesis at  <dig> different points. the combinatorial approach revealed an increase in the overall anti-adenoviral effect; however, this effect was modest when we inserted only one copy of the ptp-mi <dig> sequence into the vector . because concatemerization of identical amirna sequences has been shown to increase knockdown rates  <cit> , and concatemerization of ptp-mi <dig> has also previously resulted in enhanced silencing of ad <dig> ptp  <cit> , we added more copies to the vector. we did not observe any detrimental effects on cell viability that could potentially occur due to the higher number of amirnas potentially competing with endogenous mirnas. in case of in vivo testing of this and related vectors, this point would have to be carefully addressed, though. the increased additive effects of combined hsv-tk/amirna expression obtained with this final vector were most pronounced when gcv was applied at very low concentrations  . at these low concentrations, inhibition of adenoviral replication mediated by hsv-tk expression alone became marginal ; however, it was restored to normal levels upon concomitant knockdown of ptp gene expression by ptp-mi <dig>  this observed effect is conclusive because, at very low concentrations, gcv-ppp needed for the blockage of dna polymerization is expected to become limiting when, at the same time, high numbers of viral dna replication complexes work in parallel to synthesize high numbers of viral dna molecules. in contrast, the incorporation rate of gcv-ppp into nascent viral dna strands should increase when only a few viral dna molecules are generated.

in summary, our data suggest that wt adenovirus dna replication can, in principle, be blocked most effectively by targeting  <dig> independent steps needed for viral dna replication, namely  the formation of the initiation complex, and  the actual dna polymerization step. targeting of these mechanistically different steps may not be restricted to the way we accomplished it, but may also prove a useful strategy when aiming to inhibit adenoviral dna replication by novel “conventional” drugs or small-molecule inhibitors. in general, our strategy does not allow to cure wild-type virus-infected cells from the infection, and it cannot prevent them from cell death. however, it can effectively decrease the output of infectious virus progeny from these cells, and consequently prevent virus spreading.

in an envisioned therapeutic scenario, the delivery of anti-adenoviral amirnas, via a replication-deficient adenoviral vector, may have several unique advantages. for example, it may allow for the amplification of amirna and hsv-tk expression cassette copy numbers upon exposure of the recombinant virus to the wt virus due to the initiation of vector replication. this transcomplementation effect has already been demonstrated earlier for the ptp-mi <dig> amirna expression cassette in vitro <cit> . in addition, this effect may ensure a constant supply of recombinant vector as long as wt adenovirus is present. moreover, due to the shared organ tropism of the adenoviral vector and its wt counterpart, delivery via an adenovirus-based vector may also permit the directing of the vector predominantly to those cells and organs that are also the preferred targets of the wt virus. among those is the liver which functions as a major virion multiplicator during adenovirus infection and is readily transduced by adenoviral vectors  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable, that strategies as the one presented here are able to reduce the output of infectious wt virus at least from this particular organ, and, consequently, inhibit spreading of the virus throughout the body. because the immune response against the wild-type virus is heavily impaired or inexistent in immunocompromised patients, problems that can occur due to the elimination of adenoviral vectors by the immune system should be less pronounced or absent in such an envisioned scenario. alternatively, topical treatment of localized adenovirus infection, e.g., of the eye, where high local vector concentrations can be achieved, is conceivable for immunocompetent patients as well. adenovirus-mediated epidemic keratoconjunctivitis  is associated with significant morbidity and possible long term consequences on visual acuity, and thus causes considerable economic losses.

adenoviral vectors are among the most commonly used vectors for the delivery of genetic information in vivo <cit> . in most cases, replication-deficient vectors whose e <dig> and e <dig> genes are deleted are employed. in theory, no viral genes should be expressed from these vectors. leaky expression of viral genes from replication-deficient viral vectors, however, is known to occur due to the presence of binding sites for certain cellular transcription factors in adenoviral promoters  <cit> . this background expression from both early and late promoters can result in toxicity and immunity against adenoviral proteins  <cit>  and, consequently, to short-lived transgene expression. the amirna generated from the combinatorial hsv-tk/amirna expression cassette, when included in such vectors, may potentially prevent leaky ptp expression from the adenoviral e2b promoter. it may, thus, inhibit any potential low-level replication and, consequently, late gene expression , thereby preventing the generation of highly immunogenic late gene products such as the hexon and fiber proteins. in fact, deletions within the e2b region that comprises the viral dna polymerase and ptp genes lead to decreased downstream gene expression in e1-deleted adenoviral vectors  <cit> , resulting in extended transgene expression and reduced liver toxicity  <cit> .

the hsv-tk expression unit of the cassette, in conjunction with the amirna expression unit, may also help to bring any unforeseen high-level replication of adenoviral vectors under control, should they turn into replication-competent versions . the elimination upon treatment with gcv would only affect the rearranged vector and not the parental vector because the latter would not promote the synthesis of significant amounts of hsv-tk. thus, the combinatorial gene expression cassette presented here  may also be considered for evaluation as safeguards for certain adenoviral vectors intended to be used in gene therapy studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the results presented in this study demonstrate that combined expression of hsv-tk and an amirna targeting the adenoviral ptp mrna can effectively inhibit wt adenovirus replication in the presence of the antiherpetic prodrug gcv. the enhanced inhibition rate accomplished with the combinatorial gene expression cassette can most likely be attributed to the targeting of  <dig> different steps in adenoviral dna synthesis. this effect mediated by the expression cassette may not only be harnessed to inhibit wt adenovirus replication but also to prevent the replication of certain adenoviral vectors commonly used in gene therapy studies.
