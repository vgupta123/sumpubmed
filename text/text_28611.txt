BACKGROUND
microarray and next-generation sequencing  technologies have been widely used in biological and biomedical research to identify novel biomarkers and genomic modifications related to biological processes and diseases. multiple testing procedures are widely used in microarray and ngs studies to control the multiple testing error rate to minimize false discoveries from the enormous number of simultaneous hypothesis tests  <cit> . many multiple testing error rates have been proposed such as family-wise error rate   <cit> , k family-wise error rate   <cit> , and false discovery rate   <cit> . for discovery purposes, the false discovery rate , defined as the expected proportion of false discoveries among total number of discoveries, is often controlled in multiple testing procedures to select significant features in microarray and ngs studies . benjamini and hochberg’s fdr controlling procedure  <cit>  and storey’s q-value procedure  <cit>  are the most commonly used procedures  <cit> . the bonferroni procedure, although perceived as a conservative procedure for multiple testing error rate control, has stability superior to benjamini-hochberg’s procedure in terms of variability of total number of discoveries, and equivalent power to benjamini-hochberg’s procedure, when used to control the expected number of false discoveries  at a user-specified level  <cit> .

in this study, we examine the stability  of both benjamini-hochberg’s fdr controlling procedure and storey’s q-value procedure for generating adjusted p-values to select significant genes or biomarkers in microarray and ngs data analysis. in addition, we propose our own multiple testing procedure  based on bonferroni’s ev controlling procedure, that has equivalent power, higher stability, and better fdr control than the storey’s q-value procedure with at least medium-sized samples in microarray and ngs data analysis. multiple testing procedures with high power, good fdr control, and high stability are desirable in genomic data analysis due to the high cost of sequencing in genomic studies. the bon-ev multiple testing procedure will be attractive to genomic data analysts as it not only maintains the high power of storey’s q-value procedure, but also offers better fdr control and higher stability, especially for small to medium sample size studies that need high stability, high power and good fdr control to maximize the odds of true discoveries.

methods
suppose we are testing m null hypotheses simultaneously in a high-dimensional data analysis for single nucleotide polymorphism  identification, differential gene expression, or dna methylation discovery. among m null hypotheses, m
 <dig> null hypotheses are true null hypotheses. among r rejected null hypotheses, v hypotheses are false rejections . multiple testing error rates need to be controlled to minimize false discoveries among total rejections. false discovery rate  is a commonly used multiple testing error rate in genomic analysis. several definitions of fdr have been proposed to measure the false discovery rate such as fdr, positive false discovery rate , and ee. the fdr and pfdr are defined as: 
  <dig> fdr=evr|r>0pr, 



  <dig> pfdr=evr|r> <dig>  


benjamini-hochberg procedure
the benjamini-hochberg procedure  <cit>  provides control of fdr at level α through the following step-up procedure: 
order original p-values p
i,i= <dig> …,m, from the smallest to the largest such that p
≤p
·≤p
;

find k as the largest i for which p≤imα;

reject all null hypotheses h
i,i= <dig> ,…,k.




the benjamini-hochberg procedure provides fdr=m0mα≤α, a strong control for fdr at level α for independent and positively correlated test statistics. meanwhile, the benjamini-hochberg procedure is also conservative by a factor of m0m for controlling fdr at level α.

storey’s q-value procedure
arguing that where m
0=m, one would not be interested in cases where no test is significant , storey  <cit>  proposes the definition of positive false discovery rate  that is conditional on at least one rejection. the storey’s q-value procedure used for controlling pfdr improves power over the benjamini-hochberg procedure by including the estimation of π0=m0m. storey’s q-value procedure proceeds as follows: 
order original p-values p
i,i= <dig> …,m, from the smallest to the largest such that p
≤p
·≤p
;

find k as the largest i for which p≤imπ0^α where π0=m0m;

reject all null hypothesis h
i,i= <dig> ,…,k.




storey proposes to estimate π
 <dig> conservatively by π0^=♯{pi>λ}m, where λ is chosen to minimize the mean-squared error of the pfdr estimates.

bonferroni procedure
the bonferroni procedure has traditionally been considered too conservative for genomic data analysis for discovery purposes. gordon et al.  <cit>  show the bonferroni procedure has comparable power and superior stability to the benjamini-hochberg procedure when used to control the expected number of false discoveries ). the bonferroni procedure rejects h
i if pi≤γm, and controls e at a pre-specified number of tests γ when test statistics are either independent or correlated. to prove that the bonferroni procedure controls e at level γ, we assume p
i for i= <dig> ,…,m
 <dig> has an independent uniform distribution, then we have 
  <dig> e=∑i=1m0prpi≤γm=m0γm≤γ. 


if we let γ=α·e, then we have e≤α·e and ee≤α. notice that the bonferroni procedure used to control e is conservative by a factor of m0m. thus, we further improve power of the bonferroni procedure by estimating m
 <dig> and replacing m with a conservative estimator of m
 <dig> in the cutoff value.

bon-ev procedure
based on theorem  <dig> in storey’s  <dig> paper, we propose our own bon-ev procedure to control the pfdr at level α. theorem  <dig> states that: suppose that m identical hypothesis tests are performed with p-values p
 <dig> …,p
m and significant region includes all adjusted p-values p
∗ less than or equal to α. assume that  are i.i.d. random variables, p
i|h
i∼·f
0+h
i·f
 <dig> for some null distribution f
 <dig> and alternative distribution f
 <dig>  and h
i∼b
e
r
n
o
u
l
l
i for i= <dig> …,m. then 
  <dig> pfdr=pr 


based on p
f
d
r=p
r, our bon-ev procedure is as follows: 
compare each p
i with α·prπ0^, i= <dig> ,…,m;

reject h
i if pi≤α·prπ0^, i= <dig> ,…,m.




in our bon-ev procedure, p
∗ are the adjusted p-values from the benjamini-hochberg procedure, and p
r is estimated by the proportion of null hypotheses that have the benjamini-hochberg adjusted p-values ≤α. we use the same estimate of π
 <dig> as used in storey’s q-value procedure.

the following equations show that our bon-ev procedure controls pfdr at level α. 
  <dig> v=∑i=1mi. 



  <dig> e=∑i=1mpr=∑i=1mprpr=mprpr=pfdr·). 


so, if e≤α·), then p
f
d
r≤α. to have e≤α·) using the bonferroni approach, we compare each p
i with α·)m0: 
  <dig> e=∑i=1m0prpi≤α·)m0=∑i=1m0prpi≤α·)m·π0=m0·α·)m0=α·). 


thus, pfdr will be controlled at level α if each p
i is compared with α·)m <dig>  as m
0=m·π
 <dig>  we compare each p
i with α·prπ <dig>  p
r is estimated by pr=♯{pi∗≤α}m from benjamini-hochberg’s fdr controlling method and π
 <dig> is estimated by π0^=♯{pi>λ}m from storey’s q-value method. the expected values of pr and π0^ are 
  <dig> e)=e♯{pi∗≤α}m=pr; 



  <dig> e=e♯{pi>λ}m=mm=1≥π <dig>  


thus, our procedure controls e at α·) and controls pfdr at level α. we took advantage of existing r functions to estimate p
r and π
 <dig>  we estimate p
r from the p.adjust function in r with benjamini and hochberg’s method and estimate π
 <dig> using the qvalue and pi0est function from the qvalue package.

our proposed bon-ev procedure integrates the approaches of the bonferroni procedure, benjamini-hochberg procedure, and storey’s q-value procedure. the estimated π
 <dig> from storey’s q-value procedure used in the bon-ev procedure increases the cutoff value for p-values in each comparison, thus improving its power compared to benjamini-hochberg’s procedure. as the sample size increases, the π0^ is closer to the value of π
 <dig>  and the power will be further improved. by adapting the estimate of p
r from the benjamini-hochberg procedure for the bon-ev procedure, the proportion of false discoveries is reduced compared to storey’s q-value procedure. thus, we expect the bon-ev procedure to have better fdr control than storey’s q-value procedure. regarding the stability, single-step approaches such as the bonferroni and bon-ev procedures are superior to stepwise approaches such as the benjamini-hochberg procedure and storey’s q-value procedure, but, the inclusion of the π
 <dig> estimate in the bon-ev and storey’s q-value procedures reduces the stability. taken together, we expect the bon-ev procedure to have better stability than storey’s q-value procedure.

RESULTS
simulation studies
we conduct simulation studies to evaluate the fdr control, power, and stability of our bon-ev procedure, the benjamini-hochberg procedure and storey’s q-value procedure. power is defined as the proportion of true rejections among total non-true null hypotheses, and stability is defined as the standard deviation  of total number of rejections  <cit> .

our simulations compare gene expression levels between two groups with equal sample sizes of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in each group. for each sample, we test  <dig>  genes with expression levels following multivariate normal distributions with means at vector of  <dig> for the control group and means at vector of  for the treatment group. we set standard deviations at  <dig> with correlations between genes equal to ρ . all genes were equally correlated with correlation ρ. meanwhile, we also conduct simulations with pairwise gene correlations randomly selected from uniform distribution for sample sizes of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in each of the two groups. we set the proportions of differentially expressed genes  at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for each simulation study. the vector μ is set as a sequence from  <dig> to  <dig> with length equal to  <dig> ×π
 <dig>  we use t-statistics for two independent samples for testing differential gene expression between groups. each simulation include  <dig>  iterations. each procedure is set to control the fdr at the  <dig>  level.

examples using real data
as a complement to our simulation studies, we also compare apparent test power  and stability  resulting from these three different procedures using human rna-seq data  <cit> . we compare gene expression levels between  <dig> females and  <dig> males using count data from rna-seq downloaded from the recount web site  <cit> . the rna-seq data from human b-cells that we analyze include  <dig>  genes and  <dig> samples. the summarized count data from the rna-seq experiment is first filtered by only retaining genes that express at a count-per-million  above  <dig>  in at least two samples. the retained  <dig> genes are further normalized to eliminate rna composition biases between libraries by finding a set of scaling factors for the library sizes that minimize the log-fold changes between the samples for most genes using the default method-a trimmed mean of m values   <cit>  between each pair of samples. the raw p-value is obtained by fitting negative binomial generalized linear models with cox-reid dispersion estimates using the glmfit and flmlrt function in the edger package in bioconductor  <cit> .

we apply the three multiple testing procedures to the raw p-values generated from the edger package to compare the total number of rejected genes  after controlling the false discovery rate. figure  <dig> shows the apparent test powers of these three different multiple testing procedures at different fdr levels ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the bon-ev procedure and storey’s q-value procedure produce the same number of rejections at the fdr level of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the bon-ev procedure discovers more genes than the benjamini-hochberg procedure and storey’s q-value procedure when the fdr level is equal to 1%. the apparent test power comparison is consistent with our simulation results.

to examine the stability of the bon-ev procedure, we bootstrap the rna-seq samples  <dig> times within each group and obtain total number of rejections in each boostrap sample. then, we examine the stability of the bon-ev, the benjamini-hochberg procedure and the storey’s q-value procedure by calculating the standard deviation of total number of rejections from  <dig> bootstrap samples. figure  <dig> shows the stability comparison results among these three procedures, which are also consistent with the results from our simulation studies.

using a similar approach, we compare apparent test power and stability of the three multiple testing procedures using p-values generated from a differential gene expression analysis of the two most commonly used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research - c57bl/6j  and dba/2j   <cit> . data from  <dig> b <dig> mouse samples and  <dig> d <dig> mouse samples in the rna-seq experiment and the count data are again downloaded from the recount web site. using the same filtering criteria with c
p
m> <dig>  in at least two samples, we retain  <dig> genes out of  <dig> total genes. after using the same analysis method from the edger package in bioconductor to obtain the raw p-values, we apply the three different multiple testing procedures to calculate adjusted p-values. figure  <dig> shows that the number of discoveries at different fdr levels ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . our bon-ev procedure also has more discoveries at lower fdr levels. the stability shown in fig.  <dig> indicates that the bon-ev procedure has higher stability than storey’s q-value procedure. again, the results are consistent with our simulation results.

discussion
in this study, we propose a new multiple testing procedure , based on the bonferroni procedure, intended to improve fdr control and stability as well as maintain power. we compare the bon-ev procedure with the benjamini-hochberg procedure and storey’s q-value procedure using both simulation studies and real rna-seq data. our studies show that the proposed bon-ev multiple testing procedure has better control of fdr and higher stability than storey’s q-value procedure, and also maintains high levels of power at small and medium sample sizes.

next generation sequencing and third generation sequencing technology has become more popular in biological and biomedical studies. the sample size in sequencing studies remain small to medium although the price of sequencing per sample has significantly decreased in recent years. multiple testing procedures with larger power could help increase the probability of novel discoveries. the bon-ev procedure, similar to the storey’s q-value procedure, offers higher power than the benjamini-hochberg procedure and increases the cost-effectiveness of sequencing studies.

compared to the storey’s q-value procedure, the bon-ev procedure offers better fdr control. in recent years, irreproducibility of results in biomedical research has drawn increasing attention in the popular press and academia  <cit> . investigations have found many landmarks in preclinical oncology to be non-reproducible, and confirming research conducted by scientists in the haematology and oncology department at the biotechnology firm amgen in thousand oaks, california, finds only 11% of scientific findings they examined to be reproducible  <cit> . the reasons for irreproducibility are at least, in part, due to false discoveries in those studies . with better fdr control, the bon-ev procedure will enable more accurate control of false discoveries in genomic studies. meanwhile, understanding the source of variation in the data generation and analysis can help improve reproducibility of scientific studies  <cit> . multiple testing procedures are widely used to select significant features such as genes, snps, methylation loci, and others in microarray and ngs studies. assessment of the stability of statistical findings from multiple testing procedures and improving the stability of these procedures could reduce replication failures. the bon-ev procedure will help reduce replication failures compared with the storey’s q-value procedure, and provide higher stability.

CONCLUSIONS
our study investigates the stability of benjamini-hochberg and storey’s q-value fdr controlling procedures commonly used in genomic and genetic data analysis and proposes a new multiple testing procedure with higher stability, better fdr control and power equivalent to storey’s q-value procedure as well as higher power than the benjamini-hochberg procedure. the bon-ev multiple testing procedure we propose is attractive in microarray and sequencing data analysis in that it has higher power than the benjamini-hochberg procedure, and better fdr control and higher stability than storey’s q-value procedure.
