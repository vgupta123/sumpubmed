BACKGROUND
recent studies in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , drosophila melanogaster , and humans  have identified a class of mysterious genomic regions that are bound by a surprisingly large number of transcription factors  that are often functionally unrelated and lack their consensus binding motifs. these regions are called hot  regions or “hotspots”. in c. elegans,  <dig> different tfs were used to identify  <dig> hot regions bound to  <dig> or more tfs  <cit> . using the binding profiles of  <dig> different tfs, nearly  <dig> hot regions were identified in d. melanogaster, and each is bound by an average of  <dig> different tfs  <cit> . many regions that are bound by dozens of tfs were also identified in a small number of human cells  <cit> . the broad presence of these regions in metazoan genomes suggests that they might reflect a general property of regulatory genomes. however, how hundreds of tfs coordinate clustered binding to regulatory dna to form hot regions across cell types and tissues is still unclear. furthermore, the function of hot regions in gene regulation remains unclear  <cit> , and their proposed roles include functioning as mediators of ubiquitously expressed genes  <cit> , sinks or buffers for sequestering excess tfs  <cit> , insulators  <cit> , dna origins of replication  <cit> , and patterned developmental enhancers  <cit> . in addition, the effects of these regions on human diseases and cancer remain unknown. thus, it is important to systematically analyse hot regions in a large variety of cell types and tissues and to further understand their functional roles in the control of specific gene expression programs.

resolving these challenges requires knowledge of the ensemble of all tf bindings in a cell. however, even predicting where a single tf binds in the genome has proven challenging. computational motif discovery in regulatory dna is a commonly used strategy for identifying candidate tf binding sites  for tfs with known binding motifs, which are represented as position weight matrices . numerous algorithms have been developed for discovering motifs, such as fimo   <cit>  and homer   <cit> . it has been reported that tfbss tend to be dnase i hypersensitive, and only a fraction of the human genome is accessible for tf binding  <cit> . remarkably, hot regions correlate with decreased nucleosome density and increased nucleosome turnover and are primarily associated with open chromatin  <cit> . dnase i hypersensitive sites  in chromatin have been used extensively to mark regulatory dna and to map active cis-regulatory elements in diverse organisms . recent advances in next-generation sequencing  technologies have enabled genome-wide mapping of dhss in mammalian cells , laying the foundations for comprehensive catalogues of human regulatory dna regions. thus, dhss, combined with motif discovery algorithms, could be used in a very powerful approach for identifying a large repertoire of tfs in diverse cell and tissue types with high precision. this approach is likely to be widely applicable for investigating cooperativity among tfs that control diverse biological processes.

here, we have developed a computational method for the genome-wide mapping of hot regions in human genome. we have characterised and validated hot regions in embryonic stem cells . additionally, we have created a catalogue of hot regions for  <dig> different human cell and tissue types and have shown that these regions are associated with genes encoding cell-type-specific tfs and other components that play important roles in cell-type-specific developmental processes. we have shown evidence for the developmental persistence of hot regions at primitive enhancers and have demonstrated unique signatures of hot regions that distinguish them from typical enhancers and super-enhancers. importantly, our epigenetic analysis revealed a preliminary view of dynamic epigenetic regulation of hot regions upon cell differentiation.

RESULTS
identification and validation of hot regions
recently, we used gaussian kernel density estimation across the binding profiles of  <dig> tfs to identify tfbs-clustered regions and defined a “tfbs complexity” score based on the number and proximity of contributing tfbss for each tfbs-clustered region  <cit> . a preliminary inspection of these regions with different tfbs complexity revealed an unusual feature: although the vast majority  of the tfbs-clustered regions exhibited only low tfbs complexity, a small portion of the tfbs-clustered regions exhibited much higher tfbs complexity scores . the former were called lot  regions, whereas the latter were called hot  regions.

hot regions were initially defined as regions with high occupancy of tfs and were identified by the binding peaks of many tfs using chip-seq data in previous reports . however, we defined hot regions by the colocalisation of a large number of tf motif binding sites and identified them using the tf motif scanning method iform  <cit>  on dhss with pwms for  <dig> tfs. to validate our identified hot regions, we compared them with the experimental hot regions that were defined by the encode consortium, which assessed more than  <dig> tfs from approximately  <dig> chip-seq experiments in more than  <dig> cell types  <cit> . we performed a gsc  analysis between our hot regions and the experimental hot regions in five cell types, including h1-hesc, k <dig>  hep-g <dig>  hela-s <dig>  and gm <dig> cells . the gsc results indicated that our hot regions were significantly enriched and depleted compared to the experimental hot and lot regions, respectively. in addition, our lot regions were significantly enriched and depleted compared to the experimental lot and hot regions, respectively. furthermore, we used the experimental hot and lot regions to validate our hot regions with roc  curves and the corresponding area under the curve  in each cell type. our results demonstrated that our hot regions have powerful discrimination ability between the experimental hot and lot regions .fig.  <dig> identification and validation of hot regions a error bar showing the gsc results for hot/lot regions versus experimental hot/lot regions. red lines indicate the mean and normalised sd of  <dig>  bootstrap samples; the blue bar indicates the real statistics. b the proportions of hot regions and experimental hot regions containing different numbers of chip-seq peaks corresponding to tfs in h <dig> cells. c the distributions of tf complexity of hot regions containing different numbers of chip-seq peaks corresponding to tfs in h <dig> cells. d error bar showing the gsc results of hot regions versus motifless binding peaks. white lines indicate the mean and normalised sd of  <dig>  bootstrap samples; blue and red bars indicate the real statistics of experimental hot regions and our predicted hot regions, respectively. e distributions of the number of cell types, from  <dig> to  <dig> , in which hot  and lot  regions in each of nine classes  are observed. the width of each shape at a given y value shows the relative frequency of regions present in that number of cell types. see also additional file 1: figures s1–s <dig> and additional file 2: tables s1–s5



to further verify whether tfs indeed bound within the hot regions, we counted the occurrence rates of peaks in the chip-seq data that corresponded to diverse tfs that were located within our hot regions and the experimental hot regions. we found that the number of tfs that colocalised within our hot regions  was much greater than the number of tfs that colocalised within the experimental hot regions  . our results suggest that our hot regions are strongly skewed relative to the experimental hot regions toward occupancy by a large number of transcription factors identified via chip-seq experiments by the encode consortium. additionally, with the increase in the tfbs complexity of our hot regions, the number of tfs that colocalised within our hot regions also increased .

previous studies have revealed that some chip-seq binding peaks of tfs do not contain the dna sequence motifs of the corresponding tfs; these peaks are designated motifless binding peaks of the tfs  <cit> . we explored the relationship between the motifless binding peaks of all tfs and our identified hot regions. we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  motifless binding peaks in h1-hesc, k <dig>  hep-g <dig>  hela-s <dig>  and gm <dig> cells, respectively. we compared these motifless binding peaks with the hot regions that we identified within tf chip-seq binding peaks for each cell line. we determined that the proportion of the motifless binding peaks intersecting with the experimental hot regions  was larger than that of the motifless binding peaks intersecting with our hot regions  . however, the proportion of motifless hot regions in our hot regions was much larger than that of motifless hot regions in the experimental hot regions  . this result reflects the much smaller number and longer length of our hot regions, furthermore, gsc analysis demonstrated that the statistical z-scores of the intersections of the motifless binding peaks with our hot regions and the experimental hot regions were greater than  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . our results indicate that although our hot regions are essentially different from the experimental hot regions, motifless hot regions represent a substantial fraction of both our hot regions and the experimental hot regions.

taken together, these findings strongly validate our identified hot regions. additionally, the tfbs complexity adequately represented the colocalisation of multiple tfs within our hot regions. furthermore, our results clearly clarified the discrimination between our hot regions and experimental hot regions that have been reported in the literature  <cit> .

general characterisation of hot regions
using a uniform processing pipeline, we created a catalogue of  <dig>  distinct hot regions across  <dig> cells/tissues studied under the encode project  <cit> . collectively, these hot regions span  <dig>  % of the genome . to assess the rate of discovery of new hot regions, we performed a saturation analysis as described in a previous study  <cit>  and predicted saturation at approximately  <dig>  hot regions, suggesting that we have discovered more than half  of the estimated total number of hot regions . an additional location analysis of these  <dig>  hot regions demonstrated that hot regions were more likely localised to genic regions  and less likely localised to intergenic regions compared with lot regions . furthermore, hot regions are typically much more cell-selective than lot regions . promoter proximal hot regions typically exhibit high accessibility across cell types, with the average proximal hot region detected in  <dig> cell types; however, distal hot regions are largely cell selective, with the average distal hot region detected in  <dig> cell types .

we further characterised these hot regions using multiple data types and showed that they are enriched for active histone markers and depleted for repressive histone markers , they are highly transcribed , they extensively overlap with the transcriptional regulators that control cell development and differentiation , they exhibit distinct sequence signatures , and their neighbouring genes illustrate functional enrichment linked to the developmental processes of the respective cell and tissue types ,  <dig>  coincide with a hot region. the accessibility of hot regions at microrna promoters was highly promiscuous compared with gencode tsss  and showed cell lineage organisation, paralleling the known regulatory roles of well-annotated lineage-specific micrornas . next, we investigated the association between hot regions and transposon sequences. a surprising number of these sequences contain highly regulated hot regions , which is compatible with the cell type-specific transcription of repetitive elements detected using encode rna sequencing data  <cit> . the examples shown in fig. 2b also illustrate the strong cell-selectivity of chromatin accessibility observed for each major class of repeats. furthermore, we compared hot regions with an extensive compilation of  <dig> experimentally validated distal, non-promoter cis-regulatory elements, such as insulators, locus control regions , transcription initiation platforms , and more. this analysis revealed that the overwhelming majority  of these elements are encompassed within hot regions  and typically show strong cell selectivity . finally, we explored the extent to which hot regions associate with different classes of dna methylation depleted regions, including low methylation regions , unmethylated regions , and dna methylation valleys . these dna methylation-depleted regions have been reported to function as cis regulatory elements that are strongly associated with transcription factor genes and developmental genes  <cit> . our gsc analysis demonstrated that lmrs, umrs and dmvs were highly enriched within hot regions  and typically showed strong cell selectivity . together, our results suggested that hot regions are highly associated with the functional regulatory elements that play key developmental roles in a manner that is typically cell-type-specific.fig.  <dig> association of hot regions with functional elements. a–b examples of hot regions  overlapping microrna a and repetitive elements b. peaks are observed in cell types consistent with known functions of the micrornas and repetitive elements . c examples of known cell-selective experimentally validated distal, non-promoter cis-regulatory elements. shown above each set of dnasei data are schematics displaying hot regions relative to the genes they control. d examples of colocalisation of dmv  and umr  with hot regions  in a cell-type-specific manner. see also additional file 1: figure s <dig> and additional file 2: tables s6–s7



hot regions at embryonic enhancers
as hot regions drive genes that control and define cell development, it is reasonable to surmise that in definitive cells, hot regions could be persistently associated with enhancers that are active during early development. we compiled  <dig> early developmental enhancers that were identified through a comparative genome analysis and experimental validation of in vivo enhancer activity in transgenic mice  <cit> . each of these enhancers displayed reproducible tissue-staining patterns in one or more embryonic tissues at embryonic day  <dig>  . of these  <dig> non-promoter human enhancers, gsc analysis demonstrated that a surprising proportion  occurred within hot regions in at least one definitive human cell type. to quantify the tissue activity spectra of these embryonic enhancers, we systematically examined their lacz expression patterns in transgenic mice and related these patterns to hot region patterning at the same elements across different definitive cell types . for example, an enhancer that is selectively active in embryonic forebrain tissue  was selectively found in hot regions within cells derived from human escs , and an enhancer that is selectively active in embryonic blood vessels  was selectively found in hot regions within endothelial cells . in contrast, an enhancer with extremely broad tissue activity  was found in hot regions in nearly all definitive cell types . these findings were further confirmed across the spectrum of enhancers . a total of  <dig>  % of enhancers that are active in embryonic blood vessels were found in hot regions in endothelial cells, whereas only  <dig>  % of all other embryonic enhancers were found in endothelial hot regions. similarly,  <dig>  % of enhancers that are active in embryonic heart tissue were found in hot regions within cells derived from human heart and great vessel structures, whereas only  <dig>  % of all other embryonic enhancers were found in hot regions in these cell types.fig.  <dig> developmental persistence of hot regions at embryonic enhancers a mouse day  <dig>  embryonic tissue activity  of seven representative transgenic human enhancer elements from the vista database. shown below each image are the enhancer id and numbers of individual embryos with enhancer activity  in the indicated anatomical structure. b dnasei hypersensitivity at seven enhancer elements corresponding to a across  <dig> definitive cell types. note the relationship between the anatomical staining patterns in a and the cellular restriction  of dnasei hypersensitivity. c-d persistence of hot regions at embryonic enhancers. c percentage of validated embryonic enhancers from the vista database with blood vessel staining  and without blood vessel staining  that overlap a hot region in any human endothelial cell type. d percentage of validated embryonic enhancers from the vista database with heart staining  and without heart staining  that overlap a hot region in any human paraxial mesoderm cell type



distal hot regions in super-enhancers
recently, richard a. young and his colleagues identified an unusual class of enhancer domains, called super-enhancers, that drive the high-level expression of genes that control and define cell identity and disease . to elucidate the relationship between hot regions and super-enhancers, we assessed the hot regions and super-enhancers from the same  <dig> cell types. we performed a gsc analysis between distal hot regions and super-enhancers in these cell types and found that hot regions were significantly enriched with super-enhancers . to determine whether hot regions might cooperate with super-enhancers to regulate cell type-specific gene regulation, we performed a colocalisation analysis of these two types of regions in 14-by- <dig> cell line combinations, as previously described  <cit>  . the diagonally matched cell line enrichment values  were much larger than the off-diagonal mismatched cell line values , indicating that cell type-specific hot regions tended to strongly colocalise with super-enhancers that function in the corresponding cell types. furthermore, we compared the densities of chromatin markers, tfs, and rna polymerase ii between hot regions, enhancers, and super-enhancers. all of these elements exhibited similar dnase i hypersensitivity. as expected, enhancer markers, such as h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig>  and p <dig>  were significantly enriched within enhancers and super-enhancers compared to hot regions. in addition, rna pol ii was significantly enriched within enhancers and super-enhancers compared to hot regions. notably, hot regions demonstrated simultaneous significant enrichment of the bivalent markers h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  whereas enhancers and super-enhancers showed both enrichment of h3k4me <dig> and depletion of h3k27me <dig> compared to the background genome . a much higher proportion of hot regions  were marked with both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  whereas only 2 % of super-enhancers were marked with both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  finally, we characterised super-enhancer-associated and hot region-associated genes by gene ontology  analysis. our results revealed that super-enhancer-associated genes are linked to biological processes that largely define the identities of the respective cell and tissue types, which is highly consistent with the results of a previous study  <cit> . however, hot region-associated genes are linked to biological processes that largely define the development and differentiation of the respective cell and tissue types .fig.  <dig> association of distal hot regions with super-enhancers a error bar showing the gsc results between distal hot regions and super enhancers. red lines indicate the mean and normalised sd of  <dig>  bootstrap samples; blue bar indicates the real statistics. b distal hot regions colocalise with super-enhancers in a cell type-specific manner. cell type-specific super-enhancers  are mapped relative to cell-specific distal hot regions  in  <dig> different cell types. c chip-seq binding profiles of super-enhancers, enhancers, and distal hot regions for the indicated dnasei and enhancer-relevant markers, including transcription factors, transcriptional cofactors, chromatin regulators, and rna polymerase ii in escs. see also additional file 1: figure s5



dynamics of hot regions during h <dig> differentiation
to preliminarily explore the dynamic changes in hot regions upon development and differentiation, we examined the hot regions during the differentiation of the hesc line h <dig> to mesendoderm , neural progenitor cells , trophoblast-like cells , and mesenchymal stem cells . we first identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hot regions in h <dig>  me, npc, tbl, and msc, respectively, as well as  <dig> hot regions in a control for terminally differentiated cells .

we first examined the dynamic changes in hot regions and correlated these dynamic hot regions with their associated gene expression. during h <dig> differentiation, we defined “gained” hot regions as those belonging to h1-derived cell types but not occurring in h <dig> cells . we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> “gained” hot regions in me, npc, tbl, and msc, respectively. more than half of the hot regions were “gained” in h1-derived cells upon h <dig> differentiation, except in npc . we observed that the genes associated with “gained” hot regions in h1-derived cells were highly expressed compared to those of h <dig> cells upon h <dig> differentiation . furthermore, the genes associated with “gained” hot regions played key roles in development-related biological processes in the respective h1-derived cells in a cell-type-specific manner .fig.  <dig> dynamics of hot regions during h <dig> differentiation a dynamic changes in hot regions during the differentiation of h <dig> cell to its derived cells. the proportions of “gained” hot regions  and “shared” hot regions  in h1-derived cells are shown. b boxplot showing the expression of genes associated with “gained” hot regions in h1-derived cells and the imr <dig> cell type  and in h1es cells , p-values were calculated by the kolmogorov-smirnov test. c go analysis of genes associated with “gained” hot regions in h1-derived cells and the imr <dig> cell type using david. for each cell type, top five biological processes were shown. d boxplot showing the expression of enriched tf genes in hot regions of h1-derived cells and the imr <dig> cell type  and in h1es cells ; p-values were calculated by the kolmogorov-smirnov test. see also additional file 2: tables s <dig> and s9



then, we scanned tf motifs in hot regions of h <dig> and its derived cell types using iform  <cit>  and identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> enriched tf genes in me, npc, tbl, msc and imr <dig> cells, respectively . these enriched tf genes were highly expressed in h1-derived cell types relative to h <dig> cells , respectively . further go analysis demonstrated that these enriched tf genes play key roles in the regulation of transcription, gene expression, and metabolic process during the differentiation of h <dig> into its derived cell types . taken together, our results improve our understanding of hot region dynamics during development and differentiation.

epigenetic regulation of hot regions upon h <dig> differentiation
to further investigate the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of hot regions upon development and differentiation, we examined the potential role of histone modifications at hot regions upon h <dig> differentiation.

previously, bivalent genes marked by both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> were shown to be highly associated with developmental genes  <cit> . intriguingly, an analysis of the data from previous studies  <cit>  showed that the genes associated with hot regions during h <dig> differentiation appeared to be highly enriched in bivalent genes . we then asked whether hot regions undergo dynamic epigenetic regulation upon development and differentiation. we examined the dynamic epigenetic modifications at these hot regions upon h <dig> differentiation and found that over 50 % of hot regions in h <dig> cells were bound simultaneously by h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  we named these regions bivalent hot regions. interestingly, the number of bivalent hot regions decreased upon h <dig> differentiation. in differentiated cells, a large portion of hot regions were bound only by h3k4me <dig> or h3k27me <dig> relative to h <dig> cells . this is in good agreement with the opinion that bivalent genes become monovalent upon cell differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, over three-quarters of bivalent hot regions in h <dig> cells were “lost”, whereas less than one-quarter of bivalent hot regions in h <dig> cells were “shared” during the differentiation of h <dig> into its derived cell types . moreover, a considerable proportion  of “lost” bivalent regions were differentiated into “activated” hot regions bound by h3k4me <dig> only, whereas only a very small proportion of these regions differentiated into hot regions bound only by h3k27me <dig> alone .fig.  <dig> epigenetic regulation of hot regions upon h <dig> differentiation. a the chromatin state  of hot regions in various cell types. b dynamic changes of bivalent hot regions between h <dig> and h1-derived cell types. c box plots showing the levels of h3k4me <dig> , h3k27me <dig> , and mrna  at activated and repressive hot regions in h <dig> and h1-derived cells. see also additional file 2: tables s <dig> and s11



we further explored the dynamic epigenetic signals upon h <dig> differentiation. we found that in h1-derived cells, the “activated” hot regions were marked by a higher level of h3k4me <dig> and a lower level of h3k27me <dig> compared to the h <dig> bivalent hot regions. moreover, the “repressed” hot regions in h1-derived cells were marked by a lower level of h3k4me <dig> and a higher level of h3k27me <dig> compared to the h <dig> bivalent hot regions. the levels of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in the activated hot regions of h1-derived cells increased and decreased during differentiation, respectively. a gene expression analysis of the “activated” and “repressed” hot regions further confirmed these findings . furthermore, we performed go analysis of the bivalent hot regions in h <dig> and the activated hot regions in h1-derived cells and found that the genes associated with these regions were strongly enriched for the functional categories “regulation of transcription”, “metabolic process” and “differentiation” . taken together, our findings reveal a preliminary view of the dynamic epigenetic regulation of hot regions, which were strongly associated with developmental genes and had key roles upon cell differentiation.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have revealed regions in worms  <cit> , flies , and humans  with heavily clustered tf binding that have been termed hot regions. these reports  identified hot regions by the binding peaks of many tfs using chip-seq data, whereas we defined hot regions by a large number of tf motif binding sites on dhss in dnase-seq data. this change was made because previous investigations of experimental hot regions were restricted by the currently limited amount of tf chip-seq data and by the consistency of hot regions defined by identical combinations of tfs across diverse cells/tissues. although the identifications of hot regions were based on different data, both definitions demonstrate that hot regions are a novel class of genomic regions that are bound by a surprisingly large number of tfs and contain numerous tf motifs. importantly, our identification of hot regions using tf motif discovery on dhss can greatly extend the repertoire of both tfs and cell types in the genome, thus greatly enhancing our understanding of hot regions.

we have extended our understanding of hot regions by demonstrating that esc hot regions are highly transcribed and by identifying the population of tfs, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and core transcription machinery that occupy these domains in escs. escs were chosen for identifying components of hot regions because the tfs, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and noncoding rnas that control the esc state and that contribute to the gene expression programmes of pluripotency and self-renewal are likely better understood than those for any other cell type . hot regions are occupied by a large portion of enhancer-associated rna polymerase ii and its associated cofactors and chromatin regulators, which may explain how these molecules contribute to the high transcriptional levels of genes associated with hot regions. furthermore, the levels of rna detected in hot regions vastly exceed the levels of rna in lot regions, and recent evidence suggests that these enhancer rnas  may contribute to gene activation . several additional important insights were gained by studying how more than  <dig> tfs, cofactors, chromatin regulators, and components of the core transcription machinery occupy hot regions and lot regions in escs. all of the enhancer-binding tfs are enriched in hot regions, with some so highly enriched that they distinguish hot regions from lot regions.

by uncovering characteristic sequence signatures of hot regions, our computational analysis revealed that more than one quarter of enriched tf motifs exhibited significantly enriched binding within hot regions; the majority of these tf motifs play essential roles in development and cell differentiation. strikingly,  <dig> of  <dig> tfs  that showed specifically enriched binding within lot regions were housekeeping tfs. in combination with previous observations that hot regions are depleted in the bound tfs’ motifs  compared with regions bound by single tfs, our findings suggest that hot regions have distinct sequence features that distinguish them from lot regions and the genome background. moreover, these findings suggest that information regarding hot regions is encoded in the dna sequence.

we have generated a catalogue of hot regions and their associated genes in a broad spectrum of human cell and tissue types. hot regions tend to be cell type-specific, and the genes associated with these elements are linked to biological processes that largely define the development and differentiation of the respective cell and tissue types. genes that encode candidate key developmental tfs and noncoding rnas, such as micrornas, are among those associated with hot regions. thus, the hot region catalogue should be a valuable resource for further studies of the transcriptional control of cell development and differentiation . based on the catalogue of hot regions, our further study has explored the association of gwas snps and hot regions, and our findings have illustrated the key roles of hot regions in human disease and cancer  <cit> .

an association analysis between hot regions and embryonic enhancers presented direct evidence of the systematic developmental persistence of tissue-selective early developmental enhancers at hot regions and of the persistent imprint of enhancer roles on the formation of cross-cell-type patterning of hot regions in definitive cells. additionally, we found that super-enhancers were highly enriched in hot regions across diverse cell types, and cell type-specific super-enhancers tend to strongly colocalise with the hot regions that function in the corresponding cell types. furthermore, all enhancer markers, including dnasei, h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig>  enhancer-binding tfs and chromatin regulators, are enriched at hot regions but have lower levels of enrichment that distinguish them from super-enhancers. strikingly, we observed the paradoxical coexistence of permissive and repressive histone marks, h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  in hot regions. although go analysis revealed that super-enhancers drive the expression of genes that define the identity of the respective cell and tissue types, hot regions are associated with biological processes that largely define the development and differentiation of the respective cell and tissue types. together, our results suggest that hot regions might therefore represent a novel class of enhancers because they contain many discriminatory features that are different from enhancers or super-enhancers. the activities of hot regions and super-enhancers are both defined by the colocalisation of tfs in these regions but on different genomic scales of colocalisation. a recent study  <cit>  described the relationship between hotspots and super-enhancers in the early phase of adipogenesis, demonstrating that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancers and revealing that hotspots and super-enhancers function as two levels of regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli through cooperativity between tfs on chromatin. these findings are highly consistent with ours.

finally, we examined the dynamics changes in hot regions and correlated their associated genes and enriched tf genes during the differentiation of h <dig> into its derived cell types. we observed that these associated genes and enriched tf genes were highly expressed in h1-derived cell types relative to h <dig> cells and play key roles during development or differentiation. we further examined the dynamic epigenetic regulation at hot regions during h <dig> differentiation. we found that a large proportion of hot regions in h <dig> cells demonstrated a bivalent state, and the portion of the bivalent hot regions decreased during the differentiation of the hesc line h <dig> into me cells, tbl cells, npcs, and mscs. many of these bivalent hot regions were differentiated into activated regions. additionally, we demonstrated that the activated regions showed an inverse relationship with the levels of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  our results present a preliminary view of the dynamic regulation of hot regions upon cell differentiation and will improve our understanding of hot region dynamics during development and differentiation.

taken together, our findings provide a resource for the functional exploration of hot regions and extend our understanding of the key roles of hot regions during development and differentiation.
