BACKGROUND
rice false smut caused by villosiclava virens    <cit>  has emerged as a devastating disease in rice, due to the intense application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers and the cultivation of high-yielding semi-dwarf rice cultivars worldwide  <cit> . previously, rice false smut was considered as a minor rice disease because of its rare occurrence in limited regions, but this disease has spread widely in the last 20 years and has become a severely devastating disease in many major rice-growing regions, including asia, africa, the united states, south america and italy  <cit> . rice false smut dramatically damaged rice production in  <dig> and has continued to occur frequently  <cit> . the ustiloxin produced by this pathogen in infected plant tissues is a kind of cyclopeptide mycotoxins, which inhibits the growth of microtubules and is toxic to humans and livestock  <cit> .

to date, the knowledge of v. virens is still very limited. ashizawa et al. reported a sensitive method to quantify v. virens pathogens in soil samples using real-time pcr  <cit> . ladhalakshmi et al. studied the intensity of rice false smut in india and found that the percentage of false smut-infected tillers ranged from 5% to 85% in the southern states, and 2% to 75% in northern states  <cit> . atia et al. first investigated rice false smut in egypt and reported that the production loss caused by this pathogen ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  <cit> . tanaka et al. established a simple transformation system of this pathogen using electroporation of intact conidial cells  <cit> . fu et al. described the morphologic characteristics more precisely  <cit> .

at present, the effect of rice false smut control is far from ideal. for searching the effective and environment-friendly methods, more morphological, molecular, genomic and genetic data of v. virens are required to reveal the infection process, the interaction mechanism between host and pathogen, the genetic variety and diversity, and the genome composition of this specie.

bac libraries, physical maps and bess serve as important tools in genetic, molecular and genomic studies. bac libraries are used as templates in targeted or whole genome sequencing, physical map construction and functional complementation of genes in positional cloning. physical maps provide frames for genome sequencing and physical positions of genes and markers. bess are accurate and inexpensive genome samples  <cit> , from which initial insights into the genome composition and candidates of molecular markers can be obtained  <cit> . the combined resources of bac library, physical map and bess of a genome play even more powerful roles synergistically in the above mentioned and extended research fields. bac clones will largely increase the value and utility in targeted genome sequencing and positional cloning when mapped on a physical map. bess embedded in physical map can be used as anchors in genome comparisons to detect sequence assembly errors of the same source genome and large structural changes of phylogenetically close genomes  <cit> .

bac libraries and physical maps have been constructed for several agriculturally important fungal organisms, such as magnaporthe oryzae <cit> , blumeria graminis <cit> , fusarium graminearum <cit> , cryptococcus neoformans <cit> , trichoderma reesei <cit>  and ustilago maydis <cit> . we recently constructed a bac library for a v. virens strain, uv- <dig>  <cit> . the bac library contains  <dig>  clones and has an average insert size of  <dig>  kb. however, no physical map was constructed and no bess were produced with this bac library. here we report the construction of a bac-based physical map and genome survey of the v. virens strain uv-8b. to our knowledge, this is the first physical map and genome sequence information developed for v. virens.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of strain uv-8b
the v. virens strain uv-8b was a single spore isolated from japonica rice zhonghua  <dig>  to analyze the phylogenetic relationship between this strain and other fungal pathogens, we sequenced its 18s rrna gene and compared it with other fungal 18s rrna gene sequences. the 18s rrna gene sequence of uv-8b showed a 99% identity to those of other v. virens strains and the phylogenetic tree constructed with the nj algorithm clustered uv-8b into v. virens clade . the uv-8b strain is also related to the members of metarhizium, trichoderma and cordyceps .

bac library construction, fingerprinting and contig assembly
to obtain basic genome resources for v. virens, we constructed a bac library and a bac-based physical map of the v. virens strain uv-8b. the bac library consists of  <dig>  clones arrayed in  <dig> 384-well plates. analysis of  <dig> random bac clones showed that the library had an average insert size of 140 kb with a size range from  <dig> to 190 kb and an empty-vector rate of lower than 1% . the library was calculated to cover  <dig> -fold of the uv-8b genome .

the genome size of v. virens was estimated as  <dig>  mb.


2
the clones that contained 50– <dig> bands were imported into fpc for contig assembly.

the total bands of all successfully fingerprinted clones were  <dig> 

we fingerprinted  <dig>  bac clones using five restriction enzymes . after quality filtering as described in the methods, fingerprint profiles of  <dig>  bac clones were qualified for fpc assembly. the  <dig>  bac clones covered 9-fold genome equivalents and contained an average of  <dig> bands  per clone. based on the average insert size of 140 kb, one cb was estimated to be  <dig>  kb .

the fingerprint data of the  <dig>  clones were imported into fpc v <dig>  for contig assembly. a series of tests were performed to find optimal parameters for the assembly. table  <dig> displayed the results of assembly with tolerance  <dig> and different cutoff values. based on these tests, we chose 10- <dig> as the initial cutoff value for contig assembly. this condition setting assembled  <dig>  clones into  <dig> contigs containing  <dig>  q clones, and left  <dig>  clones as singletons. the contig <dig>  was end-merged to contig <dig> , and contig <dig>  was end-merged to contig <dig> , by the “end to end” function at terminal cutoff 10- <dig> and match value  <dig>  this result was referred as phaseia and used as standard version. the phaseia contigs covered  <dig>  mb in physical length. the discrepancy between the genome length and the physical length of all contigs might be generated by the potential redundancy of contigs, which could be detected and merged with more evidences. using “end to end” function at terminal cutoff 10- <dig> and match value  <dig>  we merged another  <dig> contigs. this result was referred as phaseib. the bac library and two versions of physical map have been opened to researchers as public genomic resources .

the cutoff value of 10- <dig> was chosen, then contig101was end-merged to contig <dig>  and contig <dig> was end-merged to contig <dig> by “end to end” function at cutoff 10- <dig>  respectively.

to evaluate the phaseia contig quality, we used pcr with primers from repeat masked bess to verify the overlaps of clones in contigs. we randomly picked contig <dig> , contig <dig> , contig <dig> , contig <dig> , contig <dig> , contig <dig>  and contig <dig> , and designed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> pairs of primers for pcr, respectively. as a result, only one clone  could not be distinctly confirmed .

bac end sequencing
to perform a genome survey and provide anchor sequences on the physical map for genome comparisons, we sequenced  <dig>  bac clones that included those clones used in fingerprinting at both ends. a total of  <dig>  high quality bess were generated after quality trimming, of which  <dig>  were paired-end  sequences and  <dig> were single-end sequences  . the maximal and the average length of the bess were 798 bp and 462 bp , respectively. the total length of the bess was  <dig> ,658 bp representing  <dig> % of the whole genome. the gc content was  <dig> %. the  <dig>  high quality bess are available in genbank .

analysis of repetitive dna in bess
repeat sequences are usually a major component of eukaryotic genomes. to gain an initial insight into the composition of repeat elements contained in uv-8b bess, repeatmasker was used to identify the known repeat elements from existing databases. the result indicated that a total length of  <dig>  bp  of the known repeat sequences was identified and contained in  <dig>   reads, among which only one read was completely recognized as repeat sequence. in the terms of the repeat category, retroelements were dominant and represented  <dig> % of the total bes length, of which the ltr elements ty1/copia and gypsy/dirs <dig> accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while the line elements accounted for only  <dig> % of the total bes length. small rna and simple repeats accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total bes length, respectively . it is interesting that few dna transposons were identified in bess in contrast to retroelements.

repeatscout was used to de novo scan the repeat sequences contained in uv-8b bess with the criterion described in the methods. a cumulative  <dig>  bp  were marked as repeat sequences with this pipeline, and were contained in  <dig>   reads. among these reads,  <dig>  were marked as complete repeat sequences. the  <dig>  reads in this result were not contained in the repeatmasker result and  <dig> reads in the repeatmasker result were not contained in this result. after repeat-masked, the bess were self-blasted as described in the methods and no reads showed more than three matches to others, proving the high sensitivity of the repeatscout pipeline.

comparative analysis of uv-8b with other fungal pathogens through bess
for functional genomics comparison and evolutionary studies of the uv-8b genome, the following  <dig> well-characterized fungal pathogen genomes were chosen: magnaporthe oryzae, botrytis cinerea, puccinia spp, fusarium graminearum, fusarium oxysporum, blumeria graminis, mycosphaerella graminicola, colletotrichum spp, ustilago maydis and melampsora lini. they were voted as the most scientifically/economically important fungal pathogens by plant mycologists  <cit> . four other fungi, metarhizium anisopliae, trichoderma reesei, nectria haematococca and cordyceps militaris, were also chosen as related species for this study, because they were close to v. virens in evolution distance and their whole genome sequences were available.

to identify the microsynteny regions of uv-8b to the above genomes, the repeat-masked uv-8b bess were used in blast analysis with the above genome sequences. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> - <dig> % of masked bess matched to the top  <dig> plant fungal pathogen genomes. in ascomycetes pathogens, f. oxysporum  and f. graminearum  showed the most hits, followed by c. graminicola , and b. graminis  showed the least hits. in basidiomycetes pathogens, u. maydis  has the smallest genome size but the highest number of hits; p. graminis  and melampsora laricis  showed less hits. among masked bess,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % matched to m. anisopliae, t. reesei, n. haematococca and c. militar, respectively, and  <dig> masked bess matched to all of those species . the similarity results were generally in agreement with the 18s rrna gene analysis.

except that the puccinia graminis, ustilago maydis and melampsora laricis were basidiomycetes, the other  <dig> of the top  <dig> pathogens all are ascomycetes.

among the blast hits, if paired-ends hit to target genomes with the criteria described in  <cit> , the regions were considered to be collinear between uv-8b and the target genomes. the results  showed that f. oxysporum and f. graminearum have more collinear regions than the others in the top  <dig> pathogen genomes. in the four related genomes, an insect fungal pathogen m. anisopliae had the most collinear regions. the higher degree of synteny between uv-8b and m. anisopliae was consistent with the results of the species distribution in the gene annotation step. since most of the target genomes were not assembled completely , the numbers of paired-end bess potentially collinear with target genomes could be higher than detected.

in order to detect large syntenic regions, we used the symap  <cit>  program based on the bess embedded in the contigs to anchor uv-8b phaseia contigs to the genomes of m. anisopliae, t. reesei, n. haematococca and c. militaris. under the symap default criteria, m. anisopliae had most anchored contigs, followed by t. reesei , consistent with the comparative analysis results mentioned above . figure  <dig> shows an example of the graphical representation of the collinear regions.

analysis of simple sequence repeats 
ssrs are potential genetic markers due to their high rate of polymorphisms. to investigate the ssr contents and their distribution in uv-8b bess, we scanned the bes dataset with sciroko <dig>   <cit> . first, the cap <dig>  <cit>  program was used to reduce the redundancy of bess; it clustered  <dig>  bess into  <dig> contigs and left  <dig>  reads as singletons. the total length of these reads was  <dig> ,880 bp. among these random genome sequences, a total of  <dig>  ssr loci were identified from  <dig> reads with the criterion described in the methods. the ssrs had an average length of  <dig>  bp, an average standard deviation of  <dig>  bp and a density of  <dig> /mb.

of these ssrs,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  represented mononucleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide, and hexanucleotide types, that were composed of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ssr motifs, respectively . the most abundant ssr types are mononucleotide and trinucleotide, in which the most abundant ssr motifs are a  and agc , respectively. the dinucleotide  and hexanucleotide  ssr types had the longest average lengths among the different ssr types. the aacc motif  had the longest length among the different ssr motifs. with the ssrs and their flanking sequences as input, a total of  <dig> pairs primers were designed for ssr loci by the primer <dig>  <cit>  program. information on the ssrs and the primers was showed in an additional file .

to compare the ssr contents and distribution patterns, the gss sequences of b. graminis, fusarium virguliforme, m. oryzae and t. reesei were downloaded from ncbi and scanned for ssrs using the same parameters of cap <dig> and sciroko programs. the ssr contents and distribution patterns varied obviously . the ssr densities of the above species were  <dig> /mb,  <dig> /mb,  <dig> /mb and  <dig> /mb, respectively, in contrast to  <dig> /mb in uv-8b. the result indicated that uv-8b and t. reesei, which were closest in phylogenetic distance among the four species, had the highest ssr densities. the frequencies of the ssr types were also different among the above species. mononucleotide types were dominant in uv-8b and m. oryzae, whereas the trinucleotide was most common in t. reesei. it is interesting that dinucleotides had the lowest frequency in all of the species. as for the frequencies of individual ssr motifs, ssr motif a was the most common motif in uv-8b, m. oryzae and b. graminis, ag was most common in t. reesei, and agc was most common in f. virguliforme.

gene annotation
before gene annotation, the repeat-masked bess were pre-processed by the cap <dig>  <cit>  program to reduce sequence redundancy. a total of  <dig> contigs were formed by the cap <dig> program and  <dig>  reads were left as singletons. the cumulative length of the processed sequences was  <dig> ,772 bp. an additional  <dig>  reads, whose effective lengths were shorter than 100 bp, were removed to improve the result accuracy. the final  <dig>   reads, whose total length was  <dig> ,048 bp, were compared with the est and nr databases of ncbi to identify coding regions. a total of  <dig>   reads with a cumulative length of  <dig>  bp  were identified as homologous to ests . found to match to nr database , were  <dig>   reads with a cumulative length of  <dig> ,495 bp , of which  <dig>  reads were homologous to both the est and the nr database. taken together,  <dig>   reads  with a cumulative length of  <dig> ,135 bp  were identified to contain coding regions, and the cumulative length of coding regions was  <dig>  bp, representing  <dig> % of the total sequences . figure  <dig> shows the target species distribution in the nr database. m. anisopliae and m. acridum had the most blastx hits.

a total of  <dig> unique go terms were assigned to  <dig>  reads, and each read was associated with  <dig>  go numbers on average. the genes showed a wide range of functional categories . the binding and catalytic activities were most abundant in the molecular function category, whereas the cellular and metabolic processes were most common in the biological process category. a total of  <dig> reads matched to the interproscan database provided a reliable dataset to understand gene function. on the other hand,  <dig> unique ec  annotations were assigned to  <dig> reads, and  <dig> pathways in which these enzymes participated were identified by the kegg map module of blast2go  <cit> , such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle . six enzymes  of the  <dig> unique ec were involved in the tca cycle.

discussion
rice is the staple food of more than 50% of people worldwide, and the problem of food deficiency is more and more severe with the expanding human population  <cit> . rice false smut caused by v. virens has emerged as a devastating disease in rice, and the ustiloxin produced by the pathogen is toxic to humans and livestock  <cit> . however, little is known about this fungal pathogen to date. in this study, we constructed the first bac-based physical map and generated a large set of bess for v. virens. these resources will serve as fundamental tools for molecular, genetic and genomic studies of this pathogen.

due to the lack of reference sequences and effective molecular markers, the contigs could not be edited. we used pcr with the primers derived from the masked bess to evaluate the contig quality. from a total of  <dig> clones analyzed, only one clone was not verified by the pcr experiment, indicating that the contig assembly is reliable. the control samples and several pairs of primers in one contig helped to discriminate the false positive pcr bands.

transposable elements  contribute largely to the evolution of fungal genomes  <cit> . in uv-8b, we found that the known repeat elements represented  <dig> % of the total bess and are mainly ltr elements. few dna transposons were identified. this may be because the percentage of retroelements is higher than dna transposons in the v. virens repeat family or because dna transposons of v. virens are less homologous with the available repetitive sequences in the fungi sub-database of repeatmasker. in the m. oryzae genome, the retroelements were also more common than dna transposons  <cit> .

by de novo searching the repetitive sequences contained in the uv-8b bes dataset with repeatscout, a total of  <dig>  bp  sequences distributed in  <dig>  reads , were marked as repeat sequences. in our results, the core-repetitive sequences that were identified by repeatscout were identified in  <dig> to  <dig> bess, while the fragments which have lower occurrence may be false positives or lowly repetitive sequences. however, the percentage of repeat sequences reduced from  <dig> % to  <dig> % if the criterion threshold for hits in bess was set as > <dig> instead of > <dig> times . there was  <dig> % genome sequences that were identified as repetitive sequences in the m. oryzae p <dig> assembly  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  reads identified by repeatscout were not identified by repeatmasker, indicating that they are new repeat elements that have not been collected in the database. fifteen known repeat element-containing reads identified by repeatmasker were not identified by repeatscout. it is possible that these elements have high-copy numbers in other fungi but low-copy numbers in the uv-8b genome or that they were under-represented in the bess.

bischoff et al. analyzed the phylogenetic placement of villosiclavae and claimed that it is related to, but distinct from, the clavicipitaceae and hypocreaceae clades  <cit> . this is in agreement with our phylogenetic analysis that most of the strains closely related to v. virens uv-8b belong to clavicipitaceae and hypocreaceae. in the processes of both genome comparison  and gene annotation , the blast hit distributions were also consistent with the result of the phylogenetic tree, except for with t. reesei. this result could be due to the fact that the genome sequences used for genome comparison were draft sequences, and less genomic resources of t. reesei were deposited in genbank for gene annotation.

to date, little is known about co-linearity of chromosome segments among filamentous ascomycete fungi  <cit>  compared to plant and animal genomes. the synteny relationship could facilitate the acquisition of knowledge about genome evolution and dynamics, comparative genomics and phylogeny  <cit> . we compared the repeat-masked bess to the top  <dig> fungal pathogens to search microsyntenic regions. the result showed that f. oxysporum and f. graminearum have the most hit numbers. the hosts of f. oxysporum range from arthropods  <cit>  to humans and also include gymnosperm and angiosperm plants  <cit> , whereas f. graminearum was notorious for causing fusarium head blight. however, the m. oryzae, which was a well-known pathogen of rice, showed few synteny regions.

alignments of contigs and bac clones to the target or reference genomes through bess were widely used to detect phylogenetic relationships and large structural genomic variations between species, such as expansion, contraction, inversion and rearrangement in plants  <cit> . these alignments could also assist in the sequence assembly and detect the assembly errors of the genome sequence of the same species  <cit> . in this study, the numbers of uv-8b contigs aligned to the target genomes were not high. this was most probably due to both the high diversities among fungal genomes and the incompleteness of the target genome sequences.

the ssrs play an important role in genetic diversity analysis and genetic map construction due to their high level of polymorphisms, co-dominance and robustness  <cit> . before substantial genome sequence availability, the bess, as random genome survey sequences, were an important resource for mining ssr markers. we found  <dig>  ssrs with an average length of  <dig>  bp and a density of  <dig> /mb, of which primers of  <dig> loci have been designed successfully. these primers are candidates for genetic analysis by pcr. it is interesting that uv-8b has a similar ssr content and distribution pattern with m. oryzae but not with the closely related t. reesei.

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed the first generation bac-based physical map of v. virens and acquired  <dig> ,658 bp of bac end sequences, representing  <dig> % of the genome. the bac library was equivalent to  <dig> x genome coverage with an average insert size of 140 kb. a total of  <dig>  bac clones were assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> clones were left as singletons. the bac library and physical map provide tools for positional cloning, comparative genomics and whole genome sequencing of v. virens. in addition, the bac end sequence analysis provides a glimpse into the v.virens genome composition, such as  <dig> % gc content,  <dig> % repetitive sequences,  <dig> /mb ssr density and approximately  <dig> % coding regions. we believe that all these information is valuable to expedite the genomic and genetic research into the important rice false smut fungus.
