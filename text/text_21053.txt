BACKGROUND
ochrobactrum anthropi is a highly versatile alphaproteobacterium with ability to colonize an exceptionally wide variety of habitats, from hostile environments such as polluted soil  <cit> , to plants  <cit> , nematodes  <cit> , insects  <cit> , animals  <cit>  and man  <cit> . two other species, ochrobactrum lupini and ochrobactrum cytisi, have been isolated from leguminosae nodules  <cit>  and were genetically undistinguishable from o. anthropi  <cit> . the  <dig> other species of the genus ochrobactrum  <cit>  could be discriminated on the basis of 16s rdna sequences but this marker was too conserved to allow a study of interrelationships among each species  <cit> . according to their habitat and/or to the relationships with their host, the population structure of o. anthropi varied. for example, biological and genomic microdiversity was higher in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere  <cit> . authors related this difference in diversity level to the expansion of clones adapted to metabolites produced by rhizoredeposition  <cit> . human clinical isolates of o. anthropi appeared diverse when analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis   <cit> , rep-pcr  <cit>  and internal transcribed spacer  sequencing  <cit> .

opportunistic infections and nosocomial outbreaks due to o. anthropi have been increasingly reported during the last decade, particularly in patients with indwelling devices  <cit> , in dialysis  <cit>  or after surgery  <cit> . o. anthropi was described as one of the gram-negative rods most resistant to common antibiotics. it resists particularly to all β-lactams, except imipenem by production of an ampc β-lactamase, och- <dig>  described as chromosomal, inducible, and resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid  <cit> . as the virulence of o. anthropi appeared to be low, its resistance to antimicrobial agents could be the major feature explaining its increasing role in human infectious diseases. however, some case reports suggested higher virulence for some strains, which are capable of producing pyogenic monomicrobial infections  <cit>  or life-threatening infections such as endocarditis  <cit> . in addition, the genome of the type strain o. anthropi atcc 49188t has been recently sequenced and contains a complete homolog of the virb operon  on the large chromosome of the bipartite genome. this operon is the major determinant of the virulence of alpha-proteobacteriarelated to the genus ochrobactrum. in brucella spp., it allows the intra-macrophagic survival and multiplication of the bacterium  <cit> . it is also the main support for dna transfer and for phytopathogenicity in agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> . in the case of opportunistic pathogens, which generally do not fully respond to koch's postulate, the link between virulence-related genes and infection is not clearly established. for example, opportunistic escherichia coli involved in bacteremia showed a different content of virulence genes between strains, and the distribution of the virulence-related genes was independent of the host  <cit> . in contrast, mlst based on sequences of housekeeping genes sequences provides evidence for positive correlation between virulence, invasiveness and clonal origin of the e. coli strains  <cit> . therefore, the behaviour of opportunistic pathogens could be considered as a clonal adaptation to human ecology. there is evidence that sequence clusters for a given gene can correspond to ecologically distinct populations, even for genes not related to the adaptative divergence between populations  <cit> .

we investigated the existence of human-adapted subpopulations of o. anthropi by the study of its population structure using multi-locus housekeeping genotyping. we used genomic fingerprinting by pfge and antibiotyping to provide complementary data to support mlst interpretation.

antibiotyping
the antimicrobial susceptibility profile was determined by the disk-diffusion assay on mueller-hinton  agar and interpreted according to the guidelines of the comité de l'antibiogramme de la société française de microbiologie  <cit> . antibiotics disks used  were as follows: amoxicillin , amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , ticarcillin , ticarcillin/clavulanic acid , piperacillin , piperacillin/tazobactam , imipenem , cefalotin , cefoxitine , cefpodoxime , cefotaxime , ceftazidime , cefpirome , cefepime , moxalactam , aztreonam , gentamicin , tobramycin , netilmicin , amikacin , isepamicin , nalidixic acid , levofloxacin , ofloxacin , ciprofloxacin , tetracycline , fosfomycin , chloramphenicol  and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole .

pfge-rflp 
genomic dna was prepared in agarose plugs as previously described  <cit>  and digested at 37°c with  <dig> u of spei . spei fragments were separated by pfge using a chef-drii apparatus  in a 1% agarose gel in  <dig> × tris-borate-edta buffer  at  <dig> v and at 10°c. pulse ramps were  <dig> to  <dig> s for  <dig> h followed by  <dig> to  <dig> s for  <dig> h. molecular weight marker was a concatemer of phage l . the strains were randomly distributed among the different gels. spei-digested dnas from strains adv <dig> and adv <dig> were respectively loaded in the first and the last well on each gel in order to standardize the migration patterns. fingerprinting profiles generated by pfge were standardized with photocapt® software . the automated band detection was visually checked. the profiles were scored for the presence or absence of dna bands. restriction fragment variability was determined by the nei and li distance method modified by using the restdist program in the phylip package v. <dig>   <cit> . clustering was predicated by the unweighted pair group average method  using the splitstree v <dig>   <cit> .

gene amplification and sequencing
genomic dna was obtained using the aquapure dna extraction kit . seven genes  were amplified using the primers shown in table  <dig>  pcr was carried out in  <dig> μl of reaction mixture containing  <dig> nm  primer ,  <dig> μm  desoxy-nucleoside triphosphates  ,  <dig>  u of taq dna polymerase  in the appropriate reaction buffer and  <dig> ng of genomic dna as the template. amplification conditions were as follows: initial denaturation of  <dig> min at 95°c followed by 35-cycles with  <dig> min at 94°c,  <dig> min at 60°c  or  <dig> min at 65°c  and  <dig> min  <dig> s at 72°c. the final extension was carried out at 72°c during  <dig> min. pcr products and molecular weight marker  were separated in  <dig> %  agarose gel in  <dig> × tbe buffer. amplification products were sequenced in both direction using forward and reverse sequencing primers  on an abi 3730xl automatic sequencer . the sequences were deposited to genbank database with accession numbers: gq <dig> to gq <dig> 

 forward primer;  reverse primer. primers in bold were used for gene sequencing in both directions.  gene start codon position on the chromosome i sequence of o. anthropi atcc 49188t .  primer denomination corresponded to its hybridization region in the gene according to the complete genome sequence of o. anthropi atcc 49188t

phylogenetic analysis
gene sequences were codon-aligned using clustalx after translation with translate http://www.expasy.org. the size of the codon-aligned sequences used for further analyses is indicated in table  <dig>  for phylogenetic analysis, concatenated sequences were re-aligned using clustalw. evolutionary distance was analyzed using phylip package v <dig>   <cit>  by neighbor-joining after distance matrix construction using dnadist . bootstrap values were calculated using seqboot and consense after  <dig> reiterations. for maximum likelihood , the most appropriate substitution model determined according to akaike information criterion calculated with modeltest   <cit>  was gtr plus gamma distribution and invariant sites. when gamma shape parameters were estimated from the dataset, ml phylogenetic analysis was performed using phyml v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . ml bootstrap support was computed using phyml after  <dig> reiterations. the sequence of brucella suis 1330t was included in each phylogenetic analysis in order to place an artificial tree root.

multi locus sequence typing 
the alignment obtained for phylogenetic treeing was used for assigning the isolates to a sequence type  number according to their allelic profiles with the help of the non-redundant databases program http://linux.mlst.net/nrdb/nrdb.htm. a minimum spanning  tree was constructed using prim's algorithm to determine the links among sts http://www.pubmlst.org. ms clonal complexes included sts that differed by  <dig> or less alleles. allele profiles were analysed using eburst v <dig> software  <cit>  to determine clonal complexes defined as sets of related strains that share at least five identical alleles at the  <dig> loci. ms clonal complexes were named mscc followed by the st number of the central st in the tree. eburst clonal complexes were named ebcc followed by the number of the predicted founder st. when the founder is unpredicted or when the complex contained only  <dig> sts, the complex was named by the most represented st or by default by the st with the lower numbering. in both ms and eburst analyses, the singleton  sts corresponded to sts differing from every other st at  <dig> or more of the  <dig> loci. a distance matrix in nexus format was generated from the set of allelic profiles and then used for decomposition analyses with splitstree  <dig>  software  <cit> . program lian  <dig>   <cit>  was used to calculate the standardized ia  and to test the null hypothesis of linkage disequilibrium as well as to determine mean genetic diversity  and genetic diversity at each locus . the number of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitutions per site was determined on codon-aligned sequences using snap software  <cit> .

RESULTS
development of a mlst scheme for o. anthropi typing
since mlst approaches have never been performed for bacteria of the genus ochrobactrum, we developed an original mlst scheme in this study. the choice of the seven loci was done on the basis of the complete genome sequence of o. anthropi atcc 49188t . amplification primers  were designed using the alignment of genes from o. anthropi atcc 49188t and its closest totally sequenced relatives brucella suis 1330t, brucella melitensis 16m and brucella abortus  <dig>  we selected  <dig> genes encoding housekeeping products involved in transcription , dna repair , stress response , amino-acid biosynthesis  and the glycolytic pathway  . they were frequently used in mlst because mutations occurred slowly and were believed to be mostly neutral  <cit> . the seventh gene, omp <dig>  encoding an outer membrane protein, was supposed to be a more variable marker. the selected loci were distributed as much as possible across the large chromosome of the bipartite genome of o. anthropi to ensure the absence of physical links between loci . the mlst scheme showed between  <dig> % to  <dig> % of polymorphic sites among genes and a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the  <dig> loci . the mean genetic diversity  among strains was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and the genetic diversity at each locus  is given in table  <dig>  h in the clinical strains population  did not differ significantly from h in the environmental population , p =  <dig> .

dn = non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site. ds = synonymous substitutions per synonymous site

all gene fragments had equivalent mol% g+c contents from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a mean value of  <dig> % that was similar to the mean mol% g+c contents of the o. anthropi chromosomes . the genes involved in amino-acid biosynthesis  appeared the most polymorphic. the gene omp <dig> that codes for an antigenic surface protein displayed a relatively low level of polymorphic sites  but the highest genetic diversity level . the majority of snps in all loci were synonymous . however, the omp <dig> locus displayed the higher rate of non-synonymous snps versus synonymous snps. the non-synonymous mutations did not correspond to any premature stop codon.

mlst revealed a human-associated clonal complex
the mlst data set for the  <dig> strains contained  <dig> genotypes or sequences types  . the largest st were st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  which contained  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> isolates, respectively. all the strains belonging to st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> were clinical isolates whereas st <dig> and st <dig> grouped strains from man and environment. st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> corresponded to pairs of geographically unrelated environmental strains, st <dig> and st <dig> to pairs of clinical strains and the remaining  <dig> sts corresponded to clinical  and environmental  unique strains. the number of sts per strain did not vary between the clinical  and the environmental population .

we constructed a minimum-spanning  tree based on clustering of the mlst profiles as a graphic representation of the population structure . in the ms tree, strains formed two major ms clonal complexes mscc <dig>  and mscc <dig>  as well as two minor complexes, mscc <dig>  and mscc <dig> . using eburst software  <cit> , the  <dig> sts were divided into  <dig> major clonal complexes, ebcc <dig>  and ebcc <dig> ,  <dig> minor clonal complexes ebcc <dig>  ebcc <dig> and ebcc <dig> each including  <dig> strains and  <dig> singleton sts .

mscc <dig> and ebcc <dig> grouped the same strains and sts . mscc <dig> grouped  <dig> strains out of the  <dig> associated to ebcc <dig>  by ms analysis, the five remaining sts grouped in ebcc <dig> belonged to mscc <dig>  or were singleton sts . other incongruence was observed between minor clonal complexes detected by eburst and ms treeing. ebcc <dig> and ebcc <dig> were split in singleton sts in the ms tree. mscc <dig> grouped  <dig> strains out of the  <dig> forming ebcc <dig> 

most of the human clinical isolates  belonged to mscc4/ebcc <dig> that exclusively contained human strains . the type strain of o. anthropi, for which the human clinical origin is highly probable albeit unproved  <cit> , also belonged to this complex. the  <dig> other clinical strains were scattered in mscc1/ebcc <dig> beside environmental strains or corresponded to mscc <dig> or to singleton sts.

the strains belonging to mscc4/ebcc <dig> colonized or infected diverse clinical sites. they were isolated in france , denmark, sweden, united kingdom and usa between  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that their clustering in the same complex did not reflect cross contamination or spread among a restricted population of patients. of note, strains isolated at the same period and in the same hospital could belong to different sts and complexes . for instance, the strains adv <dig>  adv <dig> and adv <dig> isolated from the digestive tract of patients hospitalized in montpellier  in may  <dig> belonged to different clonal complexes or to singletons. moreover, the strains clf <dig>  clf <dig> and clf <dig> were isolated in throat samples of the same patient but presented different sts.

no differences were observed regarding geographic origin, clinical site isolation or clinical situation between mscc4/ebcc <dig> strains and other human strains.

among environmental isolates, no relationships between sts or complexes and habitats, geographic origins or year of isolation could be established . for instance, the  <dig> strains isolated in association with photorhabdus luminescens from the nematode heterorhabditis indica, including two italian strains  and two guadeloupian strains , belonged to diverse sts and/or complexes. conversely, mscc <dig> grouped a strain isolated in  <dig> in argentina and a strain from sweden isolated in  <dig>  the reference strain of the species o. lupini shared its st, st <dig>  with a strain of o. anthropi isolated in a denitrification reactor. o. cytisi was represented by a singleton st.

finally, the structure of the population tested herein, particularly the existence of a human-associated clonal complex  suggested difference in the propensity of o. anthropi to live in association with human beings.

multi-locus sequence-based phylogeny
we applied distance and ml phylogenetic approaches to the concatenated sequences  of the seven loci from all sts. the two methods gave congruent trees and the ml tree is presented in fig.  <dig>  the topology of the trees confirmed the population structure determined by ms treeing and eburst. a large and robust clade grouped  <dig> strains from human origin and corresponded to the major clonal complex mscc4/ebcc <dig>  the clade corresponding to ebcc <dig> contained  <dig> strains from different origins. in this clade, the relationships between environmental and clinical strains could not be established due to the weak robustness of the branching order.

the sequences of each of the seven loci were used in the ml analysis of congruence where each ml tree was compared to the ml tree reconstructed from the seven concatenated sequences. we observed conflicting topologies regarding the tree based on concatenated sequences suggesting recombination events, particularly for the aroc- and omp25-based trees . the dnak-, reca- and rpob-based trees were more congruent. they affiliated the isolates to only  <dig> to  <dig> large clades but they failed to establish relationships inside the clades. however, the combination of the  <dig> markers gave a tree showing polymorphism inside each clade. particularly, the strains belonging to ebcc <dig> and mscc4/ebcc <dig> formed two independent robust lineages . the gap- and trpe-based trees were globally congruent with the tree based on concatenated sequences. the gene trpe appeared to be a good marker for studying the phylogenetic relationships among isolates in the species o. anthropi .

strain ccm  <dig> generally branched out of the other strains of o. anthropi suggesting that this strain could belong to another ochrobactrum species. the phylogenetic positions of the clinical strains clf <dig> and adv <dig> significantly varied according the markers, suggesting important recombination events. for instance, in the aroc-based tree, clf <dig>  adv <dig>  nim <dig> and the atypical strain ccm  <dig> grouped together since the four strains shared exactly the same aroc locus. the position of o. cytisi lmg 22713t varied according to the marker, an external position to o. anthropi was only observed in aroc, rpob and omp25-based trees. o. lupini lmg  <dig> with two environmental o. anthropi strains formed a clade branching inside o. anthropi in all trees .

recombination in ochrobactrum anthropi
we assessed the linkage between alleles from the  <dig> loci by determination of sia value. sia value is expected to be zero when a population is at linkage equilibrium, i.e., that free recombination occurs. analyses were carried out using either all isolates or all sts  in order to minimize a bias due to a possible epidemic population structure. sia was significantly different from zero when all isolates were included in the analysis  or when only one isolate from each st was included . the population studied displayed linkage disequilibrium suggesting a low rate of recombination. however, linkage disequilibrium could be present into long-term recombining populations where adaptative clones emerge over the short-term  <cit> . to explore this hypothesis, we performed decomposition analysis that depicts all the shortest pathways linking sequences, including those that produce an interconnected network  <cit> . a network-like graph indicates recombination events. the split graph  of all seven loci displayed a network-like structure, with parallel paths. however, the network generated clusters consistent with mlst major clonal complexes and phylogenetic lineages . recombination events appeared more frequently inside each major and minor clonal complex. o. cytisi lmg 22713t as well as strains ccm  <dig>  dsm  <dig> and adv <dig> corresponding to singleton sts, st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively, were less subject to recombination events with other strains. on the contrary, the strains in singleton sts adv <dig> , clf <dig> , frg19/sat , ccug <dig> , toul <dig>  and nccb  <dig>  were suspect to recombination . the positions of these strains in the phylogenetic trees varied according to the markers, as shown before and in fig.  <dig> and  <dig> 

high diversity of pfge genomotypes
the genomic dna of  <dig> o. anthropi strains  were analysed by pfge. at a 100% similarity level, pfge discriminated all the strains except lr <dig> and lr <dig>  which came from the same environmental sample. the pulsotypes were highly diverse even among strains belonging to the same clonal complex and/or sharing the same st. the clinical strains originating from a same french hospital were epidemiologically unrelated by pfge analysis . pfge clusters appeared only below a 60% similarity level , suggesting that pfge was unable to structure the population studied. members of the different clonal complexes appeared intermingled among the pfge clusters . the pfge clusters defined at 60% similarity level could not be related to any characteristic of the strains such as isolation niche, geography, lifestyle, date of isolation, or antibiotype.

antibiotypes of o. anthropi clinical and environmental strains
both clinical and environmental strains appeared highly resistant to all β-lactams, but imipenem. we observed a general susceptibility to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and an overall resistance to chloramphenicol and fosfomycin. the strains isolated from hospitalized patients did not show particular resistance characteristics when compared to environmental strains. this suggested that the high level of resistance observed in o. anthropi is a natural trait of the species mostly unrelated to the medical use of antibiotics.

discussion
we proposed here the first application of mlst to o. anthropi. our mlst scheme contains  <dig> housekeeping and  <dig> outer-membrane protein  genes, scattered on the large chromosome of strain atcc 49188t. the sequences of bipartite genomes in alphaproteobacteria suggested the plasmidic origin of the smaller chromosome  <cit> . in this mlst scheme, no loci were chosen on the small chromosome to avoid bias due to the potential difference in the evolution history of the two chromosomes. the construction of another complete mlst scheme based on genes carried by this second chromosome would be of great interest to assess the emergence and the evolution of the complex genome in o. anthropi.

at each locus examined by mlst, even at omp <dig>  genetic variation appears to be mostly neutral. the  <dig> loci had mol%g+c contents similar to that of the rest of the genome. this suggests that these genes were not recently acquired through horizontal gene transfer. st diversity in o. anthropi appeared similar to that of a significant number of bacteria ; see  <cit>  for a review. this level of sts diversity allowed a wide range of applications from strain characterisation to population structure analysis and to evolutionary studies  <cit> . a mlst scheme has been recently proposed for brucella spp., the genus phylogenetically most related to ochrobactrum  <cit> . the genes dnak, gap, omp <dig> and trpe were analysed for both brucella spp. and o. anthropi. considering these  <dig> loci, genetic diversity in o. anthropi  appeared 5-fold higher than observed in the genus brucella . this difference in genetic diversity could reflect differences in lifestyles, qualifying o. anthropi as a versatile generalist and brucella as a narrow niche-specialist. the reca gene displayed the lower genetic diversity in our scheme. it was previously used for studying the phylogenetic interrelationships among members of the family brucellaceae and appeared also unable to distinguish between some species in the genus ochrobactrum  <cit> . we confirm here the high conservation of this marker and its inefficiency to explore the interrelationships in the species o. anthropi. the rpob and dnak sequences were also conserved among strains of o. anthropi. these results justified multi-locus approaches rather than single target-based analyses for sub-typing o. anthropi. however, in our mlst study, two markers reflected the overall diversity determined by the  <dig> loci. this was the case for trpe and to a lesser extent for the gap gene. differing from rrs and reca, trpe and gap were less conserved and gave a tree with robust phylogenetic interrelationships at the sub-species level. these two markers could be tested at the intra- and the inter-genus level in order to solve conflicting taxonomic positions in the family brucellaceae  <cit> .

the population of  <dig> strains of o. anthropi appeared structured in  <dig> major and  <dig> minor clonal complexes. the calculation of standardized ia indicated a linkage disequilibrium that also evoked a clonal population structure. however, split decomposition analysis resulted in a network-like graph indicating a significant level of recombination mostly inside clonal complexes. moreover, phylogenetic conflicts were observed when the trees based on different markers were compared. the persistence of a linkage disequilibrium in populations in which recombination is frequent could be due to an epidemic population structure or to a mix of ecologically separated subpopulations  <cit> . our results were compatible with an epidemic population structure composed of a limited number of clones originating from a background of unrelated genotypes recombining frequently. our results were also compatible with a mix of ecologically separated populations i.e. environmental and clinical strains. these two hypotheses fitted with the existence of a human-associated subpopulation that either emerged as an epidemic clonal complex or encountered limited genetic exchanges with other populations. testing a larger collection of strains from diverse origins could address this question. diverse methods have been proposed for the molecular typing of bacteria in the genus ochrobactrum. its <dig> sequencing and rep-pcr have been successfully used to assess the level of microdiversity in the genus as well as to cluster the strains according to the species  <cit> . however, within the species o. anthropi there was no correlation between rep- or its1-based clusters and origin of the strains. in the collection tested, mlst data and multi-locus-based phylogeny provided evidence of a clonal complex associated to human beings.

to strengthen this evidence, the question of the representativeness of the human strains included in the mlst analysis should be addressed. most clinical strains originated from france  but they have been isolated in diverse regions and at different times from  <dig> to  <dig>  we also included  <dig> geographically unrelated clinical strains isolated in scandinavia, united kingdom or louisiana  from  <dig> to  <dig>  seven of them belonged to the major complex mscc4/ebcc <dig> beside most of the french clinical isolates. this indicated that mscc4/ebcc <dig> could be considered as a human-adapted subpopulation rather than a geographic subpopulation. the mean genetic diversity calculated from the seven loci showed no significant differences between clinical isolates and isolates from all other various origins. this is also the case for the number of sts per strain. the genetic diversity of the clinical population was confirmed at the genomic level since all the clinical strains displayed different pulsotypes indicating that they were epidemiologically unrelated. therefore, epidemiological, genetic and genomic data exclude a bias in strain sampling and enhance the robustness of the human-associated subpopulation described herein.

pfge typing appeared highly discriminative in the species o. anthropi since only  <dig> strains originating from the same environmental sample displayed the same pulsotype. none of the isolates originating from one hospital displayed the same pulsotype. this wide genomotype diversity observed here confirmed previous data showing the genomic plasticity of o. anthropi  <cit> . genomic rearrangements in plastic genomes are considered as rapid evolution mechanisms, named micro-evolution with respect to the time-scale, that could be involved in rapid adaptation processes to a particular niche  <cit> . restriction fragment length polymorphism in pfge detected genomic modifications such as rearrangements and horizontal genetic transfer events rather than single nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> . the higher discriminative power of pfge suggested that large rearrangements occurred at higher rates than intragenic point mutations in housekeeping genes in o. anthropi. despite its discriminative ability, genomotyping failed to structure the bacterial population with respect to the habitat or the origin of the strains, probably due to the lack of close relationships among the strains. the same results were obtained in previous studies based on rep-pcr where clinical, soil and rhizosphere isolates of o. anthropi appeared intermingled in a defined genomotype  <cit> . finally, genomotyping methods appeared to be the most suitable to identify a particular o. anthropi clone but should be applied to cross-contamination or to outbreak tracing rather than to population structure assessment.

the emergence of clinical-encountered subpopulations could be caused by the acquisition of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance that conferred a strong selective advantage in the hospital environment. in the case of o. anthropi, we observed no differences in antimicrobial resistance patterns between hospital-acquired and environmental strains. moreover, most of the genes analysed were not affected by the antibiotic selective pressure. the rpob gene could be object of darwinian selection by antibiotics since rna polymerase is the target for rifampicin. this is also the case for the omp <dig> gene that could be involved in the resistance to a range of antibiotics. however, dn/ds showed that rpob and omp <dig> modifications corresponded to neutral rather than to darwinian-selected mutations in the population studied. therefore, resistance to antimicrobial agents could not explain the selection of the human-associated complex mscc4/ebcc <dig> in the population of o. anthropi studied here. beside, even if the apparition of mscc4/ebcc <dig> clonal complex was not dated, one can hypothesize from the slow evolution rate of the investigated genes that it probably emerged a long time ago before being submitted to antibiotic pressure.

the existence of human-associated subpopulation unrelated to antibiotic selective pressure, in a natural population of o. anthropi, suggested that a subpopulation of this bacterium could be considered as "specialized opportunistic" pathogen. in the case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, another versatile bacterium, the clinical isolates are not specialists since p. aeruginosa environmental isolates are indistinguishable from clinical isolates  <cit> . the same situation was observed here for o. anthropi grouped in the clonal complex ebcc <dig>  one could consider that the virulence traits of p. aeruginosa reflect characters acquired by the species to survive in the environment. analysis of the complete genome sequence of o. anthropi showed a complete virb operon, which codes for a putative type iv secretion system known to be the major virulence factor in brucella spp. and in agrobacterium tumefaciens, two phylogenetic neighbours of ochrobactrum spp.  <cit> . analysis of virb polymorphism in the o. anthropi population will be of great interest. however, o. anthropi is a mild pathogen that generally causes diseases in immunocompromised patients. it probably does not display typical virulence factors but rather "human-adaptation" traits. these traits might be non-equally distributed in the population and could explain the emergence of human-adapted lineages. the detection of a human-specialized lineage in our collection of o. anthropi suggests that this versatile bacterium could be a good model to better understand the emergence of phylogenetically related strict pathogens of animals and plants, such as brucella, bartonella and agrobacterium.

CONCLUSIONS
we confirmed the high discriminative power of pfge for subtyping o. anthropi. however, this method failed to structure the population and should be reserved to investigation of epidemiologically closely related strains. the mlst scheme gave preliminary results, which could be emended after enrichment of the sts database. for this purpose, the mlst scheme and data will be deposited to the website mlst http://www.mlst.net. mlst on o. anthropi allowed for the first time  to identify a human-specialized subpopulation,  to show an epidemic population structure,  to evaluate the recombination rate. moreover, we showed that our mlst scheme could be useful for a taxonomic purpose in order to clarify systematics in the brucellaceae.

evidence of a human-associated clonal complex suggested a specialized opportunistic behaviour for o. anthropi. this study underlines the interest of studying the housekeeping genetic background in opportunistic pathogens, for which specific virulence traits remain unknown.
