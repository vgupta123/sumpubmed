BACKGROUND
for the past decade, microarray gene expression data has revolutionized all areas of life science - allowing quantification of thousands of genes in several samples simultaneously, and paving the way for countless research studies. with the advent of rna-seq data, researchers now have the ability to perform untargeted gene expression analysis via next generation sequencing  technology, obtaining qualitative sequence information as well as quantitative gene expression data. rna-seq provides a comprehensive gene expression profile of each sample – with the potential to quantify and annotate all genes and isoforms. this untargeted approach proves particularly useful when quantifying gene expression in polymorphic cell lines and in organisms with a nonexistent or provisional reference genome where the sequence of features to be quantified is unknown  <cit> . due limited availability of genomic resources for under-characterized species, rna-seq is a popular method of choice for transcriptome analyses. we present a comparison of reference-based mapping methods for rna-seq data originating from non-human primates , and their implications in downstream differential expression analysis.

mapping and assembly
rna-seq obtains gene expression estimates by assigning next-generation sequencing  reads to transcripts, either by mapping to a reference sequence, or assembling into contiguous stretches of sequence data  utilizing overlapping sequence amongst the reads themselves. these methods are termed reference-based alignment approaches, and de novo assembly approaches, respectively. reference-based alignment and de novo assembly each have advantages and disadvantages. the optimal strategy likely depends on the experimental design and available genomic and computational resources. reference-based approaches are far less computationally intensive than de novo approaches, and are well-suited for detection of low abundance transcripts  <cit> . however, reference-based mapping relies on the availability and accuracy of a reference sequence. mapping approaches must also handle reads with more than one potential mapping location. such uncertainty can arise from paralogous gene families, repetitive sequences, and shared exons of alternatively spliced transcripts  <cit> . conversely, de novo assemblers have the advantage of not requiring a reference sequence. this allows discovery of transcripts not present in a reference genome or transcriptome. de novo assemblers overcome challenges caused by mapping uncertainty, as well as long introns that may be missed by reference-based mapping methods. while the freedom from a reference sequence is appealing, de novo assemblers require large amounts of computational resources and assembly time. in addition, deeper sequencing is needed for adequate de novo transcript assembly than is required by reference-based approaches  <cit> . de novo assembly can be very useful for organisms with no reference genome, but due to its computational demands is most commonly used in cases of small genomes such as bacteria, archaea, and lower eukaryotes  <cit> . in the case of large and complex transcriptomes, such as plants and mammals, reference-based mapping methods can overcome the computational and isoform-resolving challenges faced by de novo assemblers  <cit> . in general, reference-based mapping approaches are the appropriate choice when a reliable reference genome exists. the choice becomes less clear when working with complex mammalian species with little to no genomic resources, such as under-characterized nhps.

we propose the use of a human reference genome  for reference-based mapping and expression quantification of nhp rna-seq data. an elegant study by hornett et al.  <cit>  evaluated the utility of divergent species gene sets for annotation of de novo assembly. when utilizing reference gene sets from divergent species, the authors found little bias in expression levels and strong correlation in gene expression up to approximately a  <dig> million year window. more divergent species  suffered from incorrect assignment of assembled contigs to genes. the authors found little difference in the number of genes having contigs assigned, when using chimpanzee, orangutan, macaque, or marmoset vs. human. in addition, the authors compared the use of de novo assembled transcriptomes to mapping directly to the reference predicted gene set for quantifying gene expression. when comparing the mapping of the reads directly to the predicted gene set vs. the de novo assemblies, the authors found that mapping to the gene set recovered expression data for more genes, and that expression levels were strongly correlated within gene sets detected by both methods  <cit> .

in this manuscript, we examine the mapping efficacy and utility for differential expression analyses of various reference-based approaches when the reference sequence originates from a closely related species. specifically, we utilize the human genome and transcriptome as a reference for non-human primate rna-seq data from yellow baboons, papio cynocephalus. we compare different reference-based mapping approaches – one representative method from four different mapping method categories  <cit>  to map to the reference genome, and two of these methods to map to the reference transcriptome as well.

reference-based mapping methods
reference-based alignment methods utilize the sequence for each read  to find potential mapping locations by exact match or scoring sequence similarity. mapping locations indicate transcripts of origin, and the number of reads originating from a given transcript inform on how much of the transcript was present in the sample. we briefly describe four categories of reference-based mapping methods, and subsequently show the results of one representative method from each category when mapping rna-seq reads from yellow baboon to a human reference. a summary of the four categories and the representative methods tested in this study is shown in table  <dig> table  <dig> 
reference-based mapping methods overview - summary of the four reference-based mapping method categories compared in this study



*bowtie <dig> may be considered a hybrid bwt-seed method, as multiple substrings are taken from each read for the bwt lookup of candidate mapping loci, and the alignment at each candidate loci is extended.



the first major category has been referred to as “unspliced read aligners”, which align reads to a reference without allowing large gaps such as those arising from reads spanning exon boundaries, or splice junctions . unspliced aligners may be used to align reads to a reference transcriptome or a reference genome. aligning to a reference transcriptome alleviates the need to handle splice junctions, but is limited to the analysis of known transcripts. when utilizing unspliced read aligners to map to a reference genome, reads may be mapped to potentially novel exons, however reads spanning splice junctions are likely to remain unmapped. unspliced read aligners are generally divided into two subcategories based on their methodology -“seed methods” and “burrows-wheeler transform  methods”  <cit> . seed methods align short subsequences, or seeds, from each read to a reference, requiring a perfect match in the seed subsequence. more sensitive alignment methods are then used to eliminate candidate regions where seeds cannot be extended to full read alignments. the unspliced seed method we chose to test is stampy  <cit> . bwt methods create a burrows-wheeler index of the reference sequence and efficiently search for perfect matches. mismatches may be allowed with an exponential increase in computational complexity. in general, burrows-wheeler transform methods are faster than seed methods, but seed methods provide increased sensitivity  <cit> . the unspliced bwt method we chose to test is bowtie <dig>  <cit> . a similar analysis reported that when the true reference transcriptome is available bwt methods are faster with minimal differences in alignment specificity. when the reference transcriptome of a distant species is available, seed methods result in large increases in sensitivity  <cit> . these increases in sensitivity have also been observed when aligning reads to polymorphic regions  <cit> .

methods in the unspliced read aligner category are either limited by their inability to handle reads spanning splice junctions when mapping to a reference genome, or limited to known exons and splice sites when mapping to a reference transcriptome. the second major category of mapping methods, “spliced aligners”, align reads to the whole genome, with intron-spanning reads requiring large gaps. spliced aligners accommodate junction-spanning reads by splitting them up into smaller segments and determining the best match based on alignment scores and known di-nucleotide splice signals . the spliced aligners also fall into two major categories based on their methodology - “exon-first” methods and “seed-and-extend” methods. exon-first methods begin by mapping whole reads to the genome using unspliced read aligners, and then search for spliced alignments with the remaining reads. exon-first approaches are efficient, but may miss true spliced alignments when an unspliced alignment is available in a pseudogene  <cit> . seed-and-extend methods break reads into seeds which are mapped to the genome, and much like seed-based unspliced aligners, candidate mapping locations are examined with more sensitive alignment methods. iterative extension and merging of initial seeds is performed to determine the spliced alignment. as with unspliced aligners, seed-and-extend methods are slower, but more sensitive, and show improved performance when mapping reads from polymorphic samples  <cit> . the exon-first and seed-and-extend methods we chose to test are tophat <dig>  <cit> , and gsnap  <cit> , respectively.

after mapping to a reference genome, a transcriptome reconstruction step is required to appropriately assign reads to transcipts. aligned reads spanning splice junctions are “connected”, and read counts to various isoforms of each gene are reported. this is accomplished by building a graph to represent all possible isoforms of an expressed feature. different paths through the graph represent individial isoforms  <cit> .

we present a comparison of reference-based mapping methods for rna-seq data having no true reference, but that of a closely related model organism. we assess the various methods using mapping rates, mapping locations, correlation of gene expression, as well as the utility of the data for differential expression analyses. to better understand the differences between the methods, we examine more closely the default behaviors of the four mapping methods used.

bowtie <dig> is a bwt-based unspliced aligner, with the recent addition of supported gapped alignments. this method may actually be considered a combination bwt and seed unspliced mapper. bowtie <dig> extracts multiple substrings or seeds from each read and aligns them using a bwt approach with no gaps, then extends alignments using a smith-waterman-like scoring scheme. by default, seeds are  <dig> bp and no mismatches are allowed within the seed. base call quality scores are incorporated by assigning more severe mismatch penalties at high-quality read positions. gap initiation and extension penalties are also utilized, while the number and lengths of gaps within extended alignments are not restricted. bowtie <dig> does not guarantee that the alignment reported is the best in terms of alignment score, and when there is more than one potential mapping location of equal score, one reported location is selected at random.

stampy is a seed-based unspliced aligner that uses a hash table to store the locations of 15-mers in the reference sequence. for each read, candidate alignment locations are identified with a hash lookup of the 15-mers in the read, allowing for one mismatch. candidate mapping locations are screened for sequence similarity with the read, and then full alignments are attempted at each remaining candidate location. as with bowtie <dig>  stampy also considers base quality calls, and allows gaps in this alignment step. stampy also allows the use of bwt as a “pre-mapping” step to increase speed, however the manual does not recommend this for paired-end data. for this reason, and for method-comparison purposes, we did not use the bwt option. stampy uses a bayesian probabilistic model to represent mapping quality, and reports the single best alignment location.

tophat <dig> is an exon-first spliced read aligner that uses bowtie <dig> as a base algorithm. like the original tophat, potential splice sites are detected within candidate alignment locations, and used in a subsequent step to align reads spanning exon-junctions. tophat <dig> first maps to the transcriptome with bowtie <dig>  remaining whole reads are then mapped to the reference genome, and then spliced alignments are attempted. most of the default bowtie <dig> parameters when run within tophat <dig> are the same as the default standalone bowtie <dig> parameters, with the exception of seed length and intervals between seeds. tophat <dig> seeds within bowtie <dig> are  <dig> bp, and the interval between seeds is longer. tophat <dig> reduces alignment to pseudogenes by aligning reads preferentially to genes within provided annotation. this use of annotation by tophat <dig> has been shown to increase sensitivity and accuracy of mapping. we provided tophat <dig> with annotation information for this purpose. in addition to gapped alignment in the bowtie <dig> step, tophat <dig> also allows indels in the spliced alignment detection step.

gsnap is a seed-extend spliced aligner that allows for long and even chromosome spanning gaps, likely resulting from gene-fusion events. gsnap uses all 12-mers in the read to identify candidate mapping locations, not favoring positions within short reads. alignments are extended at candidate loci, requiring that the read has a consecutive stretch of  <dig> nucleotides exactly matching the reference sequence. gsnap allows multiple mismatches and long indels, but only allows one splice or indel per read. splicing is identified in two different ways - searching surrounding sequence for splice signals, or a user-provided set of known exon-intron boundaries.

also worth noting is each methods’ default handling of reads mapping to multiple locations. with the default parameters, tophat <dig> reports the single alignment having the best alignment score. if there are multiple locations with the same optimal alignment score, tophat <dig> will report up to  <dig> of these results. bowtie <dig> by default performs a non-exhaustive search for distinct valid alignments, and then reports the single best result of the identified alignments. if there are multiple alignments with the same alignment score, a single result is selected at random. because the search is not exhaustive, bowtie <dig> does not guarantee that the alignment reported is the absolute best in terms of alignment score. similar to bowtie <dig>  stampy reports the single best alignment, selecting one result at random when more than one alignment shares the best mapping quality. gsnap reports up to  <dig> valid mapping loci based on match, mismatch, and gap thresholds. as with the matching parameters, all of the reporting parameters of these mapping tools may be adjusted.

RESULTS
we mapped rna-seq reads from  <dig> yellow baboon  peripheral blood samples to a human reference using four different mapping methods, two of which were used to map to the reference genome and the reference transcriptome. specifically, the six different techniques included bowtie <dig>  <cit> , stampy  <cit> , tophat <dig>  <cit> , and gsnap  <cit>  for mapping to the reference genome, and bowtie <dig> and stampy for mapping to the reference transcriptome. we then assessed the utility of each mapping method with mapping rates, base mismatch rates, mapping locations, detected transcripts, correlation of gene expression estimates, and differential expression analysis results. the  <dig> baboon samples were taken from  <dig> different animals at  <dig> time points, where the phenotype of interest is clinical bacterial pneumonia infection . when mapping rna-seq reads from a distant nhp species to human reference sequence, we see differences in the utility of various mapping methods with respect to mapping rates, detected genes, correlation of expression values, and differentially expressed genes.table  <dig>

mapping statistics
for each of the mapping methods, we computed the average and standard deviation of several mapping statistics across the  <dig> samples. table  <dig> shows a summary of these mapping statistics. we first examine overall mapping rates and locations of the four methods, illustrated in figure  <dig>  examining the overall mapping rates, we see that gsnap obtains the lowest mapping rates, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this is likely due to the  <dig> nucleotide exact match requirement, and the single gap or splice restriction. any reads spanning exon junctions that would align well with an additional small gap on either side of the intron will not be considered. other reads mapping to divergent regions may not have a continuous stretch of  <dig> conserved nucleotides. tophat <dig> was reported to be more sensitive and accurate than gsnap  <cit> , which was of similar sensitivity as the original tophat  <cit> . gsnap was found to perform poorly on short-anchored reads   <cit> . tophat <dig> and gsnap were found to perform similarly on single-end reads with small indels , but gsnap performed better on indel alignments with paired-end reads  <cit> . in this study tophat <dig> obtains significantly higher mapping rates ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . bowtie <dig> mapping to the reference genome  obtains higher still mapping rates of  <dig>  to  <dig> . when mapping to the reference transcriptome, bowtie <dig> obtains slightly higher mapping rates of  <dig>  to  <dig> . we see slightly lower mapping rates with tophat <dig> than bowtie <dig>  regardless of the fact that bowtie <dig> is the underlying algorithm of tophat <dig>  as previously mentioned, the only difference in default parameters is the seed length and interval between seeds. tophat <dig> runs bowtie <dig> with a shorter seed, which would suggest increased sensitivity, but a longer interval between seeds, which would lead to decreased sensitivity. because the interval between seeds is longer, less seeds are used to identify candidate mapping locations, and with the default of no mismatches allowed within a seed some correct alignment loci would not be considered. stampy achieves the highest mapping rates ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when mapping to the reference transcriptome, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  when mapping to the reference genome . this is likely due to the shorter seed length, and the allowance for a single mismatch in seeds, allowing more candidate loci to be considered. all increases in mapping rates were significant.table  <dig> 
summary of mapping metrics results for the compared reference-based methods


sd - standard deviation.
mapping statistics for reference transcriptome and reference genome methods. panel a shows the mapping, unique, duplication, base mismatch, and rrna rate for each of the mapping methods. error bars show plus/minus one standard deviation. mapping rate is computed as mapped reads divided by total reads, unique rate is computed as unique mapped reads divided by mapped reads, duplication rate is computed as duplicate mapped reads divided by mapped reads, base mismatch rate is computed as the number of bases not matching the reference divided by the number of aligned bases, and rrna rate is computed as the number of reads mapping to ribsomal rna divided by the total reads. panel b shows the mapping locations for the two reference genome mapping methods. each value is computed as the number of reads mapping to a type of region divided by the total reads mapped.



we also observe higher base mismatch rates when mapping to the reference transcriptome. this may be partly due to the fact that the default settings of bowtie <dig> and stampy are more sensitive, and so reads may be successfully mapped to more divergent regions. another possible contributing factor is the presence of splice variants in baboon not present in human. the human reference transcripts may contain additional or missing exons with respect to baboon, causing mapped reads that span the true exon junction to have a high mismatch rate for a short stretch of sequence. unique, duplication, and rrna rates are all similar across the mapping methods.

we also examined the mapping locations - intergenic and intragenic . mapping to the reference transcriptome obtains an intragenic mapping rate of  <dig>  simply due to the nature of the mapping procedure. when mapping to the reference genome, we see that bowtie <dig>  stampy, and gsnap all obtain a significantly higher intergenic and intronic mapping rates than tophat <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  . conversely, tophat <dig> obtains a significantly higher exonic mapping rates ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  to  <dig>  for bowtie2-g,  <dig>  to  <dig>  for stampy, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for gsnap. this is likely due to tophat2’s preferential mapping to the reference transcriptome prior to exploration of genomic locations.

detected transcripts
using rna-seqc version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , we computed the number of known human transcripts detected by each method. rna-seqc defines a transcript as detected if at least  <dig> reads map to an exon region. we found that all methods detect significantly more known transcripts than gsnap, which ranges from  <dig> - <dig> . bowtie2-g detected significantly more transcripts than gsnap, ranging from  <dig> - <dig> . stampy-g detected significantly more transcripts than gsnap and bowtie2-g, ranging from  <dig> - <dig> . stampy-g was followed by bowtie <dig> and tophat <dig>  ranging from  <dig> - <dig> , and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively. the difference in detected transcripts between bowtie <dig> and tophat <dig> was not significant. finally, stampy detected significantly more transcripts than all other methods, ranging from  <dig> - <dig> . we do not see 100% of transcripts represented, but that is to be expected. the transcripts present in a single tissue type will not contain an organisms full repertoire of transcripts  <cit> . there were a total of  <dig>  human transcripts in our annotation set . we also examined the detected genes, collapsing all splice variants, in functional groupings determined by gene ontology  <cit>  annotations. panel a of figure  <dig> shows the percent of genes detected within each gene list. we observe little differences in the ability of each mapping method to detect genes in different functional groups compared to the full gene set. it is worth noting that for some functional groups, the differences seem less or more pronounced. for example, stampy’s increased sensitivity seems less pronounced within immune system genes. this may be due to the nature of our samples - we might expect immune system genes to be highly expressed. similarly, we examined the ability of each mapping method to detect genes at varying evolutionary distances. using papio anubis refseq genes as a surrogate for papio cynocephalus, we identified human orthologs, computed jukes-cantor evolutionary distance, and examine the percent of genes detected within evolutionary distance strata . panel b of figure  <dig> shows the mean and standard deviation for percent of genes detected at increasing evolutionary distances. while this is a small set of genes, we see an approximately linear decrease in percent genes detected as evolutionary distance increases, up until the highest evolutionary distances, where the difference in sensitivity is minimized as all methods lose the ability to detect genes. we still see that stampy detects the most genes, followed by bowtie <dig>  tophat <dig>  stampy-g, bowtie2-g, and gsnap.figure  <dig>

correlation of gene expression
we examined correlations of normalized and log-transformed gene expression between baseline samples within the same mapping method, and correlations between normalized and log-transformed gene expression levels computed with results from the different mapping methods. panel a of figure  <dig> shows a heat map of the pearson correlations between all biological replicates of baseline samples, for all methods. we see strong correlation between samples for all methods . similarly, panel b shows boxplots of these correlations. these correlation coefficients are very strong, with none falling below  <dig> , and the mean of each method above  <dig> . the spearman correlation coefficients were also computed, yielding similar results with slightly lower correlation coefficients overall. these results are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig> figure  <dig> 
correlation of gene expression. panel a shows a heat map of all pairwise pearson correlations between gene expression of each baselines  sample computed with the results of each of the mapping methods. panel b shows boxplots of the correlations between gene expression of baseline samples , within each method. panel c shows the dendrogram of gene expression using the average euclidean distance between gene expression estimates for each sample.



we also computed the pearson correlation between the different methods for identical samples. this is illustrated by the blocks off the diagonal in panel a of figure  <dig>  bowtie2-g and stampy-g had the highest correlations, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . gsnap and stampy had the lowest correlations, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . as performed in the above analysis,the spearman correlation coefficients were also computed. when examining correlations between different methods for identical samples we also observed similar results with slightly lower correlation coefficients overall. these results are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> to further illustrate the concordance in gene expression estimates obtained with each mapping method, we constructed a dendrogram, computing the euclidean distance in gene expression between methods for each of the baseline  samples, and then averaging the distances. examining the dendrogram in panel c of figure  <dig>  we observe tophat <dig> and bowtie <dig> have the shortest distance between gene expression estimates, followed by gsnap, bowtie2-g, and stampy-g, and finally stampy. these results are in accordance with the correlations shown in panel a of figure  <dig>  the weakest correlations are seen between the most and least sensitive methods , stampy and gsnap, respectively. this difference is less pronounced for methods of comparable sensitivity such as bowtie <dig> and tophat <dig>  for the less sensitive methods, it is possible that reads from divergent regions of transcripts are not successfully mapped, affecting expression estimates.

differential expression analysis
we used edger to identify differentially expressed genes between healthy and sick samples from the expression estimates computed with each mapping method. sick participants were considered to be animals meeting clinical criteria for bacterial pneumonia infection, at the time of maximal symptoms . we define healthy samples as all baseline samples, as well as the control doses  at the maximal symptom timepoint of  <dig> hours. table  <dig> illustrates the samples collected from each study participant, and their clinical status. in the context of this table, our differential expression analysis compared the  <dig> hour timepoint of all study participants and the  <dig> hour timepoint of participants  <dig> and  <dig>  with the  <dig> hour timepoint of participants  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows three 4-way venn diagrams of the overlap in significant differentially expressed genes after bonferonni correction, resulting from the different mapping methods. there are a large number of differentially expressed  genes shared by the methods. many of the other de genes are shared between  <dig> methods. overall, gsnap results in the fewest de genes, followed by bowtie2-g, and tophat. stampy-g, bowtie <dig>  and stampy yield the most differentially expressed genes, which is not surprising given their higher number of overall detected transcripts. the ability to detect differential gene expression will likely be less dependent on mapping method, as the ability to map reads with a single method will be constant across samples. more sensitive methods, however, may identify more differentially expressed genes simply because these genes are detected by these methods, and not others.figure  <dig>

read counts by evolutionary distance
using the orthologous genes stratified by evolutionary distance described above, we compared the number of reads mapping to homologous human genes of varying evolutionary distance by the four mapping methods bowtie <dig>  stampy, tophat <dig>  and gsnap. figure  <dig> shows read count comparisons between methods for  <dig> orthologous genes, colored by jukes-cantor evolutionary distance. points above the diagonal indicate a higher read count from the mapping method indicated on the y-axis, while points below the diagonal indicate a higher read count from the mapping method indicated on the x-axis. similar results comparing mapping methods bowtie2-g, stampy-g, tophat <dig>  and gsnap are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  most notable is the read count differences between gsnap with the others. all three methods obtain higher read counts for all evolutionary distances. as with the differences in mapping rates, these differences are likely due to the constraints gsnap places on alignments - the requirement of  <dig> base identical stretches, and the allowance of a single gap or splice site. we see strong concordance in read counts between bowtie <dig> and stampy, with bowtie <dig> obtaining slightly more read counts for more conserved genes, and stampy obtaining slightly higher read counts for less conserved genes. tophat <dig> and bowtie <dig> also show strong concordance, with fairly even “spread” of read count changes. tophat <dig> and stampy are similar, with stampy obtaining slightly higher gene counts for the most divergent genes. these results are in accordance with the mapping rate differences.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we present a comparison of reference-based mapping methods for mapping non-human primate rna-seq data to a human reference. four different mapping approaches against the reference genome, and two mapping approaches against the reference transcriptome were assessed using mapping rates, mapping locations, detected transcripts, correlation of gene expression, and differential expression analysis. table  <dig> shows a summary of our comparison of the reference-based mapping methods, when default parameter settings are used. we show that when aligning rna-seq reads to a surrogate reference, it is important to consider the intricate details of the methods used. we have found that the use of shorter seeds, allowance of mismatches within seeds, and the allowance for alignment gaps in addition to splice junctions are essential for sensitive read mapping. specifically, a seed length of approximately  <dig> bp, allowing a single mismatch within seeds, and allowing for at least  <dig> gaps and/or splice junctions in spliced alignments will facilitate very sensitive read mapping. when utilizing the default behaviors of the methods compared here for mapping nhp data to a human reference, we recommend stampy for maximum sensitivity within known genes. however, it should be noted that all methods have adjustable alignment parameters, and in most cases could be optimized for more sensitive alignment. with the proper parameter settings, each may achieve suitable sensitivity for reference-based mapping of nhp species. we also point out that a major limitation of reference-based mapping of nhp data to a human reference will not identify all genes that may be implicated in a particular phenotype. this will likely depend on the evolutionary distance between species, and on the conservation of the genes of interest. however, for exploratory purposes and hypothesis generation, reference-based mapping of nhp data may have great utility.table  <dig>
